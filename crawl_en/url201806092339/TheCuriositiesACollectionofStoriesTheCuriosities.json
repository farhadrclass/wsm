I read this book because I love reading short stories/anthologies. The blurb really hooked me because:\n-A vampire locked in a cage in the basement, for good luck.- Bad guys, clever girls, and the various reasons why the guys have to stop breathing.- A world where fires never go out (with references to vanilla ice cream). \n Now tell me if that didn't make you a bit crazy. I had a high expectations to this one and I regret to say that this is a disappointment.Reasons why The Curiosities: A Collection of Storiesand me is not meant to be:1. I think this is the type of book that fans of these authors would surely appreciate. This book is kinda like a cross between a draft book and a scrapbook. Authors write certain comments and thoughts everywhere and instead of being amused by it, it distracts me.There I was, reading the stories and all of the sudden a doodle or a comment by an author would come up and I was like, \"dafuq, I was reading\".2. Fucking cliffhangers everywhere.Look, I'm a fan of cliffhangers. I think they are a necessity sometimes, but must you have to end every story with this? Some stories are really good (mythology, monsters, urban legends) but the abrupt endings ruined it. I always wonder what's the point of the story or did I miss something crucial.I'm not sure if some people who hadn't read any books from these authors would enjoy this, but I think this book is mostly for the fans of Maggie Stiefvater, Brenna Yovanoff and Tessa Gratton ."}, {"userName": "Sana", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5862550-sana", "userReview": "I've never been much of a short stories person because I always end up wanting more and more importantly, have a hard time reading them back to back because it's hard to surface out of a story and dive into another immediately.For some reason, I appreciate that there isn't any apparent word limit to the stories as the shortest story has 3 pages and the longest, more than 20 pages.I liked all of the stories by Maggie Stiefvater the best (why aren't they all novels especially A Murder of Gods, A History of Love, Council of Youth, and Heart-Shaped Box) and then I liked Brenna Yovanoff's stories a lot (The Bone-Tender and Neighbors became my favorites) which were probably the strangest of all.

All three women contribute beautiful stories and giggle-worthy notations, and when reviewing the entire collection, they all shine equally.Certain stories seem polished while others feel more raw. And I do not mean raw in the \"unedited\" sense but rather as more emotional and less bound by any stringent ideas of storytelling. I mean this as the utmost compliment, because these are the stories that get under your skin and make you remember them later.Some offerings in this collection are flashes of one or two thousand words, epitomizing the \"short\" in short story, while others are significantly longer. Both styles are equally satisfying, although you've been warned: much of the time, upon reaching the end, there's a rush of frustration that there isn't more. These three writers world build and sketch out characters so well, so deeply, within the space of a few sentences that when one comes to the end of the tale, you find yourself wanting much, much more. Or at least I did. My outbursts of, \"Wait, that's it? What the hell!?\" were not shouts of offense but desperate cries for more of that story, because there's always more even if the writer never puts it on paper (and I want to read it, damn it!). Also, because I really, really enjoyed some of these stories and, much like a child trying to get just one more bedtime story, I'm greedy and prone to hissy fits.The introductions to each story are insightful, giving peeks into how that particular writer developed her story, where it came from and why. And while others may find the annotations in the margins distracting, I loved them. I felt the commentary added an additional depth, sometimes serious in the way of pointing out key thoughts or moments, sometimes amusing additions that give the whole book a warmer feel. Also, I'm a big fan of snark, and there's quite a bit to be found in those margins. And when some of the stories have such bittersweet or the kind of endings that aren't quite sad but still stick with you long after you've finished, a little humorous snark is always appreciated.A must read for lovers of short stories, fans of any or all of the three authors, or writers looking for insight into story creation. And while the majority are, in fact, fantasy stories, many others are not, so don't let the genre push you away from picking up The Curiosities.A Few of My Favorite Curiosities:The Vampire Box (Gratton)Date With a Dragon Slayer (Gratton)Puddles (Gratton)The Bone-Tender (Yovanoff)The Last Day of Spring (Stiefvater)Council of Youth (Stiefvater)Heart-Shaped Box (Stiefvater)Berserk (Gratton)"}, {"userName": "All Things Urban Fantasy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2732683-all-things-urban-fantasy", "userReview": "Review courtesy of All Things Urban FantasyIn May of 2008, three unknown writers formed a critique group and website (MerryFates.com) for posting short stories and honing their craft. Fast forward to today, and these three writers are among the best and brightest YA authors writing today. Maggie Stiefvater, Tessa Gratton, and Brenna Yovanoff are what I consider to be the holy trinity of YA, and in this wonderfully imaginative anthology, it is abundantly clear why.I kid you not, there isn\u2019t a single crummy story in THE CURIOSITIES. I\u2019ve never said that about an anthology, but it\u2019s true. There are strange, spooky, and sad stories mixed with charming, creepy, and comical tales. Curious to see how Maggie Stiefvater writes zombies? Or Brenna Yovanoff\u2019s version of a ghost story? How about Tessa Gratton\u2019s take on vampires? Most\u2013though not all\u2013of the stories have an element of the supernatural, but even the \u201cnormal\u201d stories have that magical pull about them that make you sigh with frustration that the stories aren\u2019t longer.Authors will be especially interested in the notes and introductions to each story as the insight into the creative processes of these three authors in invaluable. The whole collection feels like a private journal with all the little doodles and margin notes. It was incredibly fun to see the birth of characters that later found themselves in full novels like Cole from Maggie Stiefvater\u2019s Shiver series.

If you are unfamiliar with these authors they have a website called Merry Fates that they each contribute a short story to every week. These stories are for those who like their stories on the strange or \u201ccurious\u201d side of life.What I liked about this collection was the fact that the authors contributed their thoughts to each other\u2019s stories and the interesting tidbits that they would contribute about their own stories. I wished there were more notes than there actually were. This inside look into their minds was quite funny and horrifying at the same time. I highly recommend this collection for those who want to write because of some of the insight these authors have to give.This collection is filled with a bunch of short stories. Some of these stories are wonderful and others left me shaking my head. I don\u2019t want to go into each story because that is just too much so I am going to focus on the one main story that I really enjoyed by each author.Berserk by Tessa Gratton is clearly the longest story in this collection. (Maggie and Brenna give her crap for writing the longest stories.) Rein is a Berserker who just got done from a terrible war where his ilk were all killed. The troll wars continue and he is a lone rider that discovers a lone survivor after her family is slaughtered. This story was heartbreaking yet empowering at the same time. A young girl discovers the strength in herself to destroy those who ripped apart her life. Tessa writes before the story that this came from a thought about why being a Berserker would be a good thing. This story came from wanting to understand a characters motivations and why they were the way they were. Plus, this story gets bonus points for mentioning my home state.Heart-Shaped Box by Maggie Stiefvater is a strange take on immortality. What would you do to live forever? This story may not actually be about immortality, more of a how do I keep living for now instead of dying from a terrible disease but I think deep down it was a story on immortality. It also brings up the fact, why is one person more important to live than another. This was another story that made me a bit sad but I\u2019m still thinking about it and the terribleness of this world. Maggie states that this story was based off of the box from Snow White but I can\u2019t help but think of the Nirvana song.Brenna Yovanoff really enjoys the tragic stories with messed up endings. I feel like she\u2019s got something for deadly men and even deadlier women. That being said, Scheherazade is the one story that really stuck with me. A woman is confronted with a man who wants to kill her only he doesn\u2019t realize that he\u2019s more than met his match on the killing front. I had a hard time picking which story to choose from her because I did like her take on the fantasy genre.The Curiosities was a fun collection. I enjoyed every story even the ones that left me scratching my head saying \u201cWhat?!?\u201d I\u2019m not much of a fan for open endings so there were a couple stories that matched that criteria. As discussed within, opening endings are endings too, I just like having a definitive ending. I\u2019m really excited to see that they have released a second collection. I can\u2019t wait to pick it up.FTC Advisory: Lerner Publishing Group provided me with a copy of The Curiosities.

All are bestselling authors, two of which have series under their belts. They have also started a blog called 'The Merry Sisters of Fate', where most of the pieces in this collection first appeared. (That site can be found at: themerryfates.com.) I have read books from Yovanoff and Stiefvater, and will be looking into Gratton's work as soon as I'm able. (Norse mythology in young adult fiction? I am so excited for The Songs of New Asgard series!)This book completely blew me away. A collection of pieces from all three women, complete with drawings and notes in said pieces. It was an unusually formatted book, but I loved it. As both a reader and writer, it spoke to my soul. It was beyond thrilling to be granted a window into all three women's writing processes, as well as to read these beautiful, though often dark, stories. I'm not going to review it like I normally do for a short story collection, as there are just far too many to review one at a time. But you can also see, through this volume, the deep friendship that the authors share: as women, as authors, and as readers. This book was such a treat, in that the stories were so intensely personal.This book really has me tempted to go to my library and grab as many books by these three as possible. The short stories in this collection were like brief, tiny windows into the worlds (and minds) of these blockbuster authors, and I enjoyed every single dark, twisted, crazy minute of it. There was not a story in this book that didn't speak to me in some way--I loved them all. It was such a fun journey into how these women think and work--it felt like I was being admitted to a secret world, the world of people who do what I do for a living: write, even when they want to tear their hair out. It was so fun.What can I say? This book was just wonderful, and if anyone has ever been curious about the writing process, or love short stories, you need to get your hands on this must-have collection. I promise you, you won't regret it. The bottom line: A fun, and often dark, window into these writers' brains, The Curiosities is a fantastic, can't miss collection--a short story volume to be read by all who have a passion for stories and writing!

These are but a few of the curiosities collected in this volume of short stories by three acclaimed practitioners of paranormal fiction.But The Curiosities is more than the stories. Since 2008, Maggie, Tessa, and Brenna have posted more than 250 works of short fiction to their website merryfates.com.

Think of it as a guided tour of the creative processes of three acclaimed authors.So, are you curious now?Summary courtesy of GoodreadsREVIEW:To understand this review, you need to understand how much I adore Maggie Stiefvater and everything she writes. When I first read her werewolf series, Shiver, I thought it was pretty good. When I read the sequel, Linger, I thought it was great. After finishing the series conclusion, Forever, it solidified my respect for her. If I could choose one person to write like, it would be her. Of course, there is always the incredible John Green, but he is in a league by himself. Honestly. The wonderful thing about Maggie is that she is very multi-talented. Somehow she managed to write beautifully, have four main characters with their own POV\u2019s, branch off in other directions after the Shiver trilogy, and become one of my favorite authors in the process. I like that she gives an equal amount of time and effort to each character and none of them ever seem under-developed. It boggles my mind when authors write in multiple POV\u2019s. Two point-of-views, is one thing, but FOUR?! Insane. She also wrote a stand-alone novel and has started a new series. That is even more impressive. After an author finishes a major series they can get into this rut. Maggie didn\u2019t do that. She continued to branch out and try and succeed. The main point of me telling you all of that is for you to see that I am very biased towards her. I can\u2019t help it. I\u2019ve read all her books, and even met her in person (along with Tessa Gratton and Brenna Yovanoff, but we\u2019ll get to that later). I\u2019m not sure if I would\u2019ve loved The Curiosities had she not been one of the authors. Actually, I\u2019m still not sure if I loved it. Maybe it\u2019s because I had never read an anthology of short stories before that drove me crazy or maybe it was the short stories themselves. I liked them all and some I loved but in short stories you don\u2019t get the time to invest yourself in the characters, even when you really want to. This killed me. There were so many spectacular ideas in those stories I would want to read individual novels for. I am undoubtedly a novel person but I\u2019m very pleased that I read this. I learned a lot as a writer from all of the drawings and advice scribbled in the margins. It was lovely to be able to witness these famous authors develop and grow before they were famous. Writing can be overwhelming and having someone right there sharing stories that are unedited and previously used as tools to improve their writing, was very reassuring. After finishing, I felt motivated to write. Crazy, huh?! I had never thought about short stories as \u201cnovel playgrounds\u201d. I always become so afraid to \u201cwaste\u201d an idea on a short story so I don\u2019t write and pretend I\u2019m saving it for a novel. Needless to say, discovering that my philosophy sucked was a huge revelation. As for the actual stories in the book, I had many favorites and, yes, I did enjoy Maggie\u2019s the most. But, I will say that after I while I stopped trying to identify who wrote what and whose handwriting belonged to whomever. Although after meeting Brenna and Tessa and hearing about some of their other books, I will definitely be checking those out to get a better idea of their style. For those of you who have read the book a few of my favorites were:A Murder of Gods/Stiefvater \u2013 I love mythology stories and groups of kids rebelling against adults. When I was younger I was always the kid who thought she was going to start a revolution on the playground. Beserk/Gratton- I would have sobbed if this had been a novelGirl Raised by Wolves/Yovanoff- This story was shocking. Everything made sense, it\u2019s just that one minute the girls were talking and the next\u2026Of course, there were many more by Maggie that I adored but I\u2019m starting to feel bad that I spent the whole time talking about her. Brenna and Tessa were really wonderful as well, I promise. I wish I had bought a copy of the book when at the signing my library hosted because I know that this is a book I will want to flip through again and again."}, {"userName": "Jessica at Book Sake", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3503667-jessica-at-book-sake", "userReview": "After having reading works by each of the authors and visiting the Merry Sisters of Fate website, I was excited to see this book come out. Each short story features a little intro by the author of that story along with another one of the writers and their view on the story.ARC reviewed by Jessica for Book Sake.All of the stories have handwritten notes from the authors in the margins. Often they talk about what they liked and what worked and how they got to that point in their writing process (and maybe even what one author wishes she would be able to write as well as the others). I\u2019m not certain if the finished book will state whose comments are whose, but in the ARC it didn\u2019t show that \u2013 so unfortunately I couldn\u2019t tell who was saying what. It would have been nice to know if it was the author commenting on her own work or if it was one of the other two making comments.Mixed in between the stories are a few extra handwritten things from the authors. The usual \u2013 hand drawn diagrams of what subject matter makes up their brain, what their office space looks like, lists of what goes into their stories. I think that the handwritten bits are the best part of this book, especially for writers.The stories vary in length from a couple of pages to 20ish (at least via a digital book). There are a number of standouts from each other, as well as a number that just went on and on and seemed to get lost. That was expected though, as what they have done on their website is new and different, clever and quirky.Any fans of any of these writers will find something to delight them. If you haven\u2019t read one, two, or any of the writers \u2013 then this is a great anthology to get to know them and find which ones writing style you like best.

I have favourite stories from these authors in this book but I'm going to chose one.Maggie theme in her stories: When I was reading her short stories I could tell a very similar theme then the other two because she has a very lighter way of telling things and gives it a creep factor to it unlike the other which are creepy but the have a darker tone, but with Maggie you go into her world and be her characters and feel like your there with them and seeing what there going through which I liked and she was very different in her ideas and her portray in her characters. My favourite story by her was the gods one which I forgot the name but it's where the kids go to this school and there protected there and then these two kids want to find who there parents are and they try to escape.Tessa theme in her stories: Her and Brenna theme are very similar but they had different ways of telling their stories like with Tessa she kids character development in each of her stories and world build up which was good and both her and Brenna had magic but Tessa was more lighter magic but both of there themes had darker meaning to it but you can laugh in all of them. My favorite story by Tessa is the one where all these ghost come on Halloween for dinner at this girls house and she has known them since she was little and had a crush on this one ghost she has known since she was 13 and it was a little cute darker kind of thing.Brenna theme's in her stories: Like I said in Tessa theme how is said both of there theme were darker with magic Brenna dealt more with more serial killers and killing instead of more happy kind of stories like the other 2 with Brenna you got to go into a serial killer head, a murder victim and romance that will never happened. you got to go in people minds that are more darker than yours which I liked and it was very different. My favorite story by her was when this intruder comes into her house and tries to kill her but the lady in the house makes a story where she actually killed someone and told him to meet somewhere so they can kill someone together, and you think that she was doing this to get out of it but in reality she killed her boyfriend and no one knows. Reading these authors different type of themes was interesting to see how they write and I like them all that I might read there book and there other anthology together which is telling how to write something."}, {"userName": "thebookishturkishKZ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6150773-thebookishturkishkz", "userReview": "This was the first collection of stories I have ever read. I\u2019m not a fan of short stories. I mainly liked it because of the authors. Maggie Stiefvater\u2019s stories are the best. I love how well she balanced horror and humor! Tessa Gratton\u2019s writing was really great times but there were some stories I wish would continue. I guess Brenna Yovanoff is good, too but her characters really need therapy!!!So here\u2019s how I rated every story (Also added my fav moments):The Vampire Box by Tessa Gratton \u2013 4 stars A Murder of Gods by Maggie Stiefvater - 4 stars \u2013 I really liked this story but the heroine is frustrating for some reasonThe Power of Intent by Brenna Yovanoff - 3 starsA History of Love by Maggie Stiefvater - 3 stars Andy and I text each other. I see his head duck as he looks at his phone, and my phone rumbles silently in my hand.Me: wow i love our kids. we should have more of them.Him: we will. i forgot to mention im pregnantI see his head turn ever so slightly as he listens for my reaction. I cannot laugh, or Daphne will emote on me, so I tap out another text.Me: i just peed myselfHim: me too. i think it gets better after the 1st tri-mester (LOL!)Girls Raised by Wolves by Brenna Yovanoff \u2013 2.5 stars. ????Date with a Dragon Slayer by Tessa Gratton \u2013 5 stars (LOVE this one!)Scheherazade by Brenna Yovanoff \u2013 4 starsThe Spiral Table by Tessa Gratton \u2013 4 starsThe Madness of Lancelot by Brenna Yovanoff \u2013 3 starsThe Wind Takes Our Cries by Maggie Stiefvater \u2013 2 starsAuburn by Brenna Yovanoff \u2013 3 starsThe Deadlier of the Species by Maggie Stiefvater \u2013 5 stars. my fav moment:Annette had been Jamie\u2019s best friend for more than a decade, but Jamie didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cShoot her, An -drew.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Andrew said. They backed up together, shoulder to shoulder, toward the counter. Jamie snapped, \u201cYou pussy.\u201d\u201cNo, really,\u201d said Andrew. He tapped the trigger. \u201cI can\u2019t.

This truly is a very curious book.I wasn't actually expecting The Curiosities to be a book full of short stories, but the more I read, the more I liked it. For the first few pages, I had to keep flipping back to the intro to check whose handwriting was whose, but I eventually got the hang of it. (Tessa's was loopy cursive, Maggie was ALL CAPS, and Brenna's was this spindly print) The stories are always preceded by some commentary by the authors. They were sometimes funny, sometimes insightful, sometimes complicated. Commentary is sprinkled throughout the stories as well.I'm not lying when I say that basically all the stories in The Curiosities are pretty darn sad. They're either sad or scary, or some strange combination of the two. And almost none of them have a happy ending. But they're always deliciously well-written. I may have been just a little worried about reading this book because of the things I've heard about Maggie Stiefvater (leaky wombs, anyone?), but it turned out that I didn't need to worry. By the way, I've never read her other books, and I've never read Tessa's or Brenna's, either.While all the short stories were original and fun, I guess my biggest complaint is that many of them don't stand out. (Thought there was this one story I didn't like very much, and that one was probably the sweetest, most easily read story in this entire book. Weird, right?) They all just sort of blend together into a fog of creepiness, plot twists, bittersweet-ness and/or unhappy endings. But while reading, they stick vividly in my head; it's just that I don't miss it very much when it's done. Did that make sense? I hope so.One of the stories I remember more vividly is titled 'Scheherazade,' by Brenna. I think it was the surprise of the ending that really got me, plus the suddenness of everything. Actually, I think I liked Brenna's stories the most. Maybe it's their creepiness, or the fact that the main characters of her stories are usually very, very bad girls who aren't afraid of doing bad things. Tessa and Maggie's stories are just as awesome as Brenna's, but most of them are generally lighter. Well, not lighter. They're more ethereal, more magical. I think Tessa might have mentioned her love of magic in the commentary. It's just a matter of taste, and maybe a matter of biases, if you've read any of these authors' novels before."}, {"userName": "Emily (Falling for YA)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4788621-emily-falling-for-ya", "userReview": "The Curiosities is a group of short stories from Maggie Stiefvater, Tessa Gratton and Brenna Yovanoff, who are critique partners. These stories were originally posted on their website The Merry Sisters of Fate. I have to admit I never read the stories posted online. I can\u2019t stand reading on my computer, it makes my eyes hurt and I always find myself getting distracted (the internets a big place). So I was very excited to read these stories in print form especially since Maggie is one of my favorite authors.The best part about this collection wasn\u2019t the stories themselves it was the doodles, notes in the margins, and introductions to the stories that each of the authors made. It gave insight in to their writing styles, how they evolved as writers, and tips and tricks for improving your own story. It also gives you an idea of how their critique partnership works and has evolved. My favorite Maggie story is a toss up between \u201cThe Last Day of Spring\u201d and \u201cAnother Sun\u201d. The two stories were very different but both had a bittersweet feel to them and I loved them both in completely different ways. My favorite Brenna story is \u201cThe Vampire Box\u201d. It was the first story in the anthology and it got me interested in Brenna\u2019s other works. It is about a vampire who lives in the basement of a girl\u2019s house. Originally, I was a bit worried about the Brenna stories. I read The Replacement and while it was well written it wasn\u2019t my thing. I should not have been worried though, many of my favorite stories in this collection were written by Brenna!My favorite Tessa story is \u201cDate With A Dragon Slayer\u201d. It is about a girl who wins a date with a dragon slayer and the strange conversation they have the night before he goes out to slay the beast. I loved the open ending and would have liked to read even more from this world. Overall, there were some stories I absolutely loved and others I didn\u2019t care for. I am glad I read this collection of stories though. It gave valuable insight in to each authors writing process and the drawings in the margins were a fun touch. I also enjoyed the banter between Maggie, Brenna and Tessa."}, {"userName": "Shelley", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4600404-shelley", "userReview": "I found this a really interesting book of short stories but it is more than a collection. This is a project stemmed from the three authors' blogs where they have shared ideas amongst each other and have given the reader an inside look of how they collaborate and review each others' work. Anyone who has ever wondered how writers come up with their ideas for books will love this fun and witty team of women. The stories included range from horror stemming from every day objects such as puddles, to psychotic women killers. You really never know what you will find in this! The biggest problem I would run into with this book is where to shelve it in a library.I had a few issues with a few of the topics included but I have to look at things which will be appropriate for junior high readers. The book only contained one s-word so I can say the language is very clean. But some of the topics would be a little iffy. I think this can go hand in hand with the horror genre. Especially when you are talking about a lot of psychological. The one that really has me wondering about appropriateness is about a girl who is going to stay the night after a Hollywood party with the host. She finds out that he is into video taping but it's not sex, it acts of pain until the woman finally gives in and then he kills them. I just don't know where I stand on this one. Overall I loved the concept of the sharing and the hand written notes in the text of the book from the different authors.

I usually have a normal review system but it won't work on a short story collection. So this will just have to be a free for all.I loved this collection of short stories. It completely inspired me. I checked it out from the library and then, before I was even to the end of it, I had to buy a copy for myself. It's that good. The reason I picked this book up was because of how much I liked Brenna Yovanoff's REPLACEMENT & PAPER VALENTINE. All the short stories are extremely well written and entertaining. Throughout the book, Maggie, Tessa, or Brenna will comment on things -- either their own writing or one of the others. There's cute little doodles all throughout the book. In a way, it's a book for writers and in another it's a completely entertaining book for just plan old readers. I learned a lot, as a writer, from these short stories. How to elegantly weave world building and character development through the story. How to end a story. How to start one. Some writers will read something and think \"oh no, how can I ever write something as good as that?\" and then wallow in despair. Generally, I reframe from doing this or else I'll never be able to enjoy a book. This time, however... I did find myself wallowing. The writing is just so good.It also totally makes me want to do a website like merryfates.com with some other writers. It really seems like they all grew a great deal by doing that.

Originally available online at merryfates.com this new volume hosts a number of their best yarns; tales of basement dwelling vampires, zombies, Arthurian knights, would-be serial killers, dragons, and much more. The charm of this collection lies in the handwritten notes, drawings, criticisms, and scrimmages between these three friends. A must for any fan of the merry fates.One thing I discovered during the read of this book - I really adore Brenna Yovanoff's writing. Really. Adore. It. Her prose is sparse and precise, and to the point. She does not mince words and I really appreciate that about her work. Tessa Gratton's stories are imaginative and lyrical, her stories crafted with such heart. Maggie Stiefvater's worlds are colorful and passionate and full of angst and phenomenon... but Yovanoff stole my heart in this book. It's worth the cost for one of her short stories alone.

I hate being ripped out of a world or away from characters too soon, hate the dangling, interpretative open endings, hate the overly refined clever little twists and touches.All of which to say, I stayed up until 4 am and finished this book in huge gulps, a single day of inspiration and maddening jealousy and awe. And then I ordered all of the authors' books that I hadn't already read. I knew Brenna Yovanoff was brilliant. I didn't know she was part of a trio of genius writers. So many good things.The stories are beautiful, tragic, shiny and shadow-wrapped. The mutual reviews, notes and doodles heighten the experience, pointing out glimmers of brilliance that you might not have (I might not have) otherwise picked up on.Get your hands on a copy of this book.

I knew only one of them before and I discovered that I dislike one of the other two.The stories seem too similar to me, too many young main characters (I know, YA, but as I said, I'm not the target audience), too many monsters, waaaay to many cliffhangers. I like monster stories, but there is only one in this book where I really understood what is scary about this particular monster. The rest of the monsters felt just like sketches to me. If I'll remember any of the stories in a month, it would be the one with scary monsters (read: fairies). Ending all (almost all?) stories with a cliffhanger is definately not my favorite trick. 1* for stories.I like the idea of this book, sort of story exchange but not really, and the adnotations authors made on each others'/their own stories, it was something new. 2*All in all, this is a nice, light read - I read it for fun between reading/writing Serious Stuff, and it was relaxing.

I've not read any of Tessa Gratton's books.Some stories were good, some were bad, some were mediocre. Some of these stories were familiar to me. I wss suprised at some of the stories that made the cut - there were many higher quality stories that I felt should have made the anthology. The overall tone and feel of this book is dark and creepy - which is what I think they were aiming for.

One thing I really like about this book is the comments and notes that the three authors have added to the beginning of stories and the margins. It is really helpful to see what each author has to say about her own and the others' writings. For example, one author might underline a sentence that captures her imagination or comment on the struggles she had writing that particular story. They will talk about what they admire in the other person's writing or mention what originally inspired her own story.I am using this book with my Jr. High writing club.
