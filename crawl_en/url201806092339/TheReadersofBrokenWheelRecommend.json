These letters, at least the ones from from Amy Harris of Broken Wheel to Sara , are interspersed throughout and we learn more about the town and the people who live there as well as about Amy and Sara. Sara loves books - how can I not like her ? I couldn't help but feel sorry for her as she arrived. Seems like she's a lonely girl hiding in her books without any friends except a few coworkers. It was a bit much for me , even as much as I love books , that there was discussion about whether one loved books more than people. It's a town of quirky characters concerned about how to entertain their tourist. The town is falling apart really . Some people had jobs and money and those who didn't were taken care of and paid back by helping fix things when needed. They all wanted to take care of Sara , paying for her food and drinks , driving her around. She decides she has to do something to pay them back and of course this involves books. It's light which is just what I was looking for , but it was a little chick lity , pretty contrived and the ending was definitely predictable. However, I'm giving it 3 stars because I grew to like some of the characters in this quirky little place, and though predictable, it was uplifting as Sara and the people in this town find a way to change each other's lives.Thanks to SOURCEBOOKS Landmark and NetGalley."}, {"userName": "Irena", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17737927-irena", "userReview": "This book should have come with the big note on its cover that says ''WARNING: SPOILERS INSIDE''.You see, this book is a book written by a book lover for other booklovers.And do you know what book lovers like to do? Talk about books. Discuss plot developmets. They often compare one story to another, wondering why the certain character chose one path over the other.Our main character, Sara, is a true bookworm, so it is no wonder that this book is full of references to other books which often ends up spoilery.When I say she is a bookworm, I mean she reads, lives and BREATHES books. You see, only a true book lover would know the difference between the smell of paperback and the one of hardback book.The story follows Sara who came to a small town Broken Wheel, Iowa, to spend her summer with her pan pel friend who's a booklover herself. Things get complicated when Amy, the woman Sara should have stayed with, ends up being death.Town citizens decide it would only be fair for Sara to stay in Amy's house like she would have in the first place, because that is what Amy would have wanted.Days pass and Sara opens a little bookstore in which she sells books that once belonged to Amy.This book is originally written in Swedish and it is already a bestseller in many countries (Croatia included). Although I have read a copy translated into English, if I didn't know I was reading a translation, I wouldn't have guessed. That is how great the translation was.What I liked about this book the most was the atmosphere in it. I really like everything about The Broken Wheel, it's rezidents and their lifestyle. I couldn't help but think about Hart of Dixie the TV show.This book has everything you need in a book: it is fun, it has a great love story that takes time when it comes to love development, it has interesting side stories, diverse characters and important issues that were discussed in the story.After finishing this book I understand why this book is an international bookseller. It deserves all the hype that's around it.If you are a booklover, I am sure you will appreciate this story. I surely do.Note: I got this book for free via Netgalley in an exchange for an honest review.

Let's see...oh yeah, nothing.Seriously, I'm a sucker when it comes to feel-good love stories, and if you've been following me or this blog for any length of time then you know full and well that books are my absolute weakness. Ever wonder whether I'm at a hopping party on a Friday night? Well don't because I'll go ahead and tell you - I'm curled up with my dog and a blanket on the couch with a good book.The Readers Of Broken Wheel Recommend was this week's big hit in terms of things that I read and I seriously cannot recommend it enough. Obviously a story written by a book lover for other book lovers, this author will definitely be going down as one of my favorite. The story is about a young girl, Sara, who arrives in the small town of Broken Wheel to visit a pen-pal that she has had for several years. But when she arrives and realizes that things are not going to play out quite as she and her friend had planned, she does what anyone would do.Start a book store, of course!Okay, so maybe not anyone would start a book store, but that's precisely what makes this book so charming. Not only does NO ONE in Broken Wheel seem to understand the pleasures of getting lost in a good book, but they can't for the life of the understand why she would want to actually get them to read in the first place. So between selling books and realizing that maybe love and the law can go hand in hand (you'll see - trust me.), Sara learns about what's really important in life.As for how I personally came to read this book is pretty funny in itself. I was seeking out books to spotlight on this site and this came as a request. Not that I didn't have high hopes for The Readers Of Broken Wheel Recommend, but I have to tell you I was blown away by how much I ended up loving this story. It was truly one of those books that I wanted to read very slowly so that it could go on forever and yet I couldn't put it down.Very rarely do I feel like I come across a book where the characters feel so real. The people of Broken Wheel, however, could easily be my neighbors, my friends, those around me. They feel THAT real, and when that's the case it makes it so so easy to feel like you're just another inhabitant of this cozy little town where the story is taking place.If you're a lover of books, reading, or just charming stories of what life holds in terms of love - I cannot recommend this one enough. I know it's not summer yet, but if you're thinking of jetting off to the beach in order to make it through this winter, PLEASE make this the book you take with you.*I was provided with a free copy of this book in order to conduct this review.The Readers Of Broken Wheel RecommendWEBSITE | TWITTER | FACEBOOK | INSTAGRAM"}, {"userName": "Esil", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil", "userReview": "The Readers of Broken Wheel is ridiculously predictable, superficial, full of improbabilities, at times painfully sentimental and definitely a book that could have used a ruthless editor to shorten it. So let me explain why I gave it 3 stars rather than 2 or less. At its core, the story is an ode to books -- about the love of books and reading -- really, a celebration of obsessive bookishness in a world with a diminishing readership. And for that reason alone, I persevered and didn't toss The Readers of Broken Wheel. Sara travels from Sweden to Broken Wheel, Iowa, to spend a two month vacation with pen pal Amy. Their common interest is an obsession with books and reading. But when Sara arrives, she finds that Amy -- who was quite elderly -- has recently died. Rather than run away, Sarah stays in Broken a Wheel, gets to know the quirky locals, develops a love interest, opens a bookstore and brings some renewed energy to Broken Wheel. The plot is quite meandering, but essentially focuses on a few characters, and their various lives, struggles and loves. The thread running throughout is Sara's love of books, and her optimism in opening a bookstore on a dying Main Street in a town of non readers. This book is a translation from Swedish. It's a challenge for an author to set a book in a country that is not her own, and at times it does feel like the author casts an oddly sentimental lopsided eye on middle America. I am sure this book will find an audience amongst readers of what is often referred to a chick lit, but it's not a particularly strong entry in the genre -- ironically Sara is a fan of Bridget Jones and Marian Keyes, describing them as her favourites amongst feel good books with happy ending. Again, my reading experience was somewhat saved by the ode to books and readers, and the underlying optimism about the redeeming power of reading. Thank you to the publisher and Netgalley for an opportunity to read an advance copy."}, {"userName": "Tadiana \u2729Night Owl\u263d", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8734459-tadiana-night-owl", "userReview": "There's a lot to love in this novel of Sara, a young, rather plain Swedish bookworm who takes a trip to the small U.S. town of Broken Wheel to visit her older pen pal and fellow book lover, Amy. When Sara arrives, she finds that Amy has died while Sara was en route, but the townspeople urge her to stay in Amy's home anyway and visit with them for the couple of months she had planned. In many ways the town is as broken as its name:\"Broken Wheel was a complete waste of brick, asphalt, and concrete. The buildings were low because there had never been any need for more than two stories. Nowadays, there wasn\u2019t even the need for one. ... There was something sad about the town, as though generations of problems and disappointments had rubbed off onto its bricks and its roads.\"But soon Sara realizes the worth of the quirky inhabitants of Broken Wheel, and as she brings changes to the hearts and minds of Broken Wheel with a used bookstore that she starts up, they begin to change the introverted Sara as well.Parts of this novel were completely charming. I particularly loved the bookstore plot, with its discussions of books and how they affect our lives.New books always had the strongest aroma. Sara assumed the printing smells just lingered and somehow, logically, disappeared once a book had been opened, read, and leafed through. That was what she thought on a purely intellectual level anyway, but she didn\u2019t quite believe it. She still believed that what she could smell were all the new adventures and reading experiences awaiting her.Sara's love for all types of literature really comes through, and will warm the heart of any book lover. Warning: Bivald spoils a few well-known books, so beware of unwanted spoilers.Other parts were trite; for example, the names and the comparisons between Broken Wheel and its rival town, Hope, were too obvious for me to really appreciate. The inhabitants of Broken Wheel are offbeat and enjoyable, but for the most part stock characters. I was a little disappointed when this novel took a turn and started focusing on a couple of romances. The main love story with Sara had its moments, but I wasn't really feeling it. I thought the secondary relationship, between a bisexual younger man and an older, repressed lady, was more interesting. In the end, it all plays out in a predictable but nevertheless heartwarming way. The writing is often insightful; the translator did a wonderful job with the English text. I completely forgot that I was reading a book that had originally been written in Swedish. I can't vouch for the accuracy of the translation itself, but the writing style was very smooth and fit well with the subject matter of the book.Content advisory: the sexual content is pretty mild, but I don't recommend this one for \"clean reads only\" readers.Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for providing this free ebook for review."}, {"userName": "Mai (Litteraturlistig)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22519562-mai-litteraturlistig", "userReview": "This book was absolute rubbish. 394 pages of stupid observations written in a clumsy and somewhat childish language combined with unbelievable characters.

The town was populated by oddballs and eccentrics who used the local bar as a gathering place. Long before Tivo and Netflix entered the picture, I tuned in each week to be a part of their crazy, funny world.This book is set in Broken Wheel, Iowa, another little town off the grid, populated with oddballs and eccentrics with no place else to go. Along comes a Swedish tourist who wants to visit her penpal friend Amy, only to find she's just in time for her funeral. Sara is a young woman who has lived her life in books, and leaving Sweden is the most daring thing she's ever done. She moves into Amy's house, uses her thousands of books to open a bookshop, and gets involved in the lives of the townspeople, none of whom read. Chaos ensues.Of course anyone who loves books will love this one: Sara's attempts to get the perfect book in the hands of people who need them are touching and familiar, and their acceptance of her and their attempts to get her nose out of a book and into their lives are funny and real.

Soon, they all begin to wish Sara could stay with them on a permanent basis. But, will she be able to extend her Visa? I love offbeat and quirky characters, unconventional love stories, and books that imbibe charm and wit, and add just a touch of whimsy to top it all off.

Sara, the main character, is the sweetest girl whose love for books was so easy to relate to. She loves smelling them, looking at them, and of course devouring them over a cup of coffee or tea.This story also contains a diverse cast of characters which I quickly grew attached to. Once again, they are very caricatured - you have the crazy woman, the insecure Catholic and even a bisexual - but in this case it simply worked, and I didn't feel like rolling my eyes at any point. I didn't expect to love this book as much as I did, but I simply couldn't help it. My only complaint is that it contains multiple references to other books (a good thing!) which are quite spoilery (a bad thing).

So maybe sweetly whimsical? Or maybe a sentence is better than a word or two: I think the reader for this book enjoys a gently rambling plot, quirky characters, romance, and above all, a passionate love of books.It was written by a Swedish author who at the time had never been to America. But from what I could tell after occasional short visits through my life, she got it spot on when she sends Sara, a lonely bookseller now out of a job, to Broken Wheel, Iowa, to visit her elderly pen friend Amy at the latter's invitation, only to discover when she gets there that Amy died.The dying town's few people all seem to agree that Sara must stay at Amy's house, which Sara isn't happy with. A bit at sea, Sara tries to figure out what to do with herself, as she meets the townspeople one at a time. When she discovers Amy's cache of books, she opens a bookstore/library. She can't actually earn a living, as her visa prevents it, but she can, and does, give away books to those she thinks might like them. Or lends them, if the reader brings a book back in order to get another.There are a lot of sharp observations about people, especially disappointed, hurt, or bewildered people. One of the best portraits is of the silently suffering George, the town drunk. One of the quirkiest is Grace, of a long line of gun-totin' Graces, as she will tell you, lengthily, whether you want to hear it or not.Grace, at one point, tells an investigating officer, Men just have no sense of anything romantic. Insist on wanting to get married and have you, rather than just hanging out with a little moonshine and some semiautomatic weapons.The women are especially well drawn, I thought.

It's about the power of books to build friendships, repair broken hearts, set dreams aloft, and change prejudices. It's a book that had so much promise, but for me ultimately fell short of the perfect \"sweet spot\" nice and cozy little story.Sara is a young Swedish woman who is pen pals with elderly Amy of Broken Wheel, Iowa -- a small down-of-it's luck town hit hard by the recession. Despite having never met in person, they develop a solid friendship, and bond over a love of books. When the bookshop Sara works at closes, she decides the time is finally right to visit Amy in the USA. Unfortunately, she arrives in town at the exact moment Amy's funeral is taking place (not a spoiler -- this all takes place in the first chapter). The residents of Broken Wheel know all about Sara from Amy's letters, and embrace her arrival. They insist that she stay, if she wishes, and welcome her with open arms. Sara soon makes friends with those in town, but is dismayed to learn that Amy was the only one in town who enjoyed reading. Sara tries to remedy this situation by opening up a bookstore in one of the many shuttered storefronts in town, and stocking the store with Amy's voluminous collection of books. True to form, each of the side characters in the book fits a role you can probably guess -- recovering alcoholic, uptight Christian lady, town busybody, handsome single guy, etc. The book's whole premise relies on Sara feeling like she \"belongs\" in the town, and like it's \"home\"; the townspeople feeling like she belongs there; and a love story. Despite nearly 400 pages (which definitely felt like it was dragging at times), some of these connections just felt weak to me. I definitely wasn't getting \"the feels\" and so the book wasn't quite as satisfying as it could have been.

She arrives just in time for the funeral of the woman, Amy, that she was to meet for the first time. They had been exchanging letters and books for some time.

She feels that she needs to give something in return, so she opens a book store with Amy's books.

Anyhow, if you like books about books, then this is definitely recommended."}, {"userName": "Rebecca Foster", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca-foster", "userReview": "Whatever would lead a European to vacation in Broken Wheel, Iowa, that \u201ccomplete waste of brick, asphalt and concrete\u201d? For Sara Lindqvist, the answer is books. Over the last two years she\u2019s built up a friendship with Amy Harris of Broken Wheel through pen pal letters and exchanges of books. Now that the bookshop where she worked in Sweden has closed down, she has a bit of time and money to devote to a trip to America. \u201cReading books isn\u2019t a bad way to live your life, but lately Sara had begun to wonder what kind of life it was, exactly.\u201d She\u2019s looking for a wider community, and certainly finds it in small-town USA. Although circumstances aren\u2019t exactly as expected when she arrives in Iowa, she makes the best of it by opening Oak Tree Bookstore (as a labor of love, mind you; she can\u2019t work on her visa). The whole town comes together to plan a wedding so Sara can earn residency, but will the ceremony convince the authorities \u2013 or is the emotion behind it such a sham after all?Given that she\u2019d never visited the States at the time she wrote this novel (published in her native Sweden in 2013), Bivald has painted a remarkably accurate picture of a tiny Midwestern town peopled with fundamentalists, gays, rednecks and a gun-toting diner owner. She\u2019s especially sensitive to the post-recession situation. It\u2019s not all doom and gloom, though. Broken Wheel is locked in a rivalry with the neighboring town of Hope, and Sara makes it a personal mission to get Iowans reading. The kind of small-town charm you\u2019d find in a Darien Gee or Jan Karon book is here in spades. I also appreciated how Sara helps people step outside their reading comfort zone: George, a middle-aged former alcoholic, delves into Bridget Jones and Shopaholic, while Caroline, a Christian busybody, tries a work of gay erotica. In all honesty, I was not too interested in Caroline\u2019s romantic exploits or George\u2019s family issues, but Bivald has done a decent job fleshing out all her secondary characters.Like \nThe Storied Life of A.J. Fikry\n by Gabrielle Zevin, this is definitely chick lit, with a predictable Pride and Prejudice-esque romance at its heart, but I much prefer Bivald\u2019s take. It\u2019s warm-hearted and sweet, whereas Fikry was pure treacle. Maybe it\u2019s the combination of bibliophilia and Scandinavian quirk that does it for me (and a dash of the epistolary never hurts). Sara has refreshingly Catholic taste: she treasures chick lit and thrillers \u2013 the good ones, anyway \u2013 alongside Austen and Candide. Although she still isn\u2019t sure whether she prefers books or people, she believes she can find just the right book for anyone. My favorite incident is probably when the town watches in awe through the bookshop window as Sara spends a record 5 hours 37 minutes reading \u2013 she eats a sandwich with one hand and switches between books when she finishes one, but barely looks up.A cute read for book lovers, provided you can stomach a bit of chick lit / romance.Notable passages:\u201cFor as long as she could remember, she had thought that autumn air went well with books, that the two somehow belonged with blankets, comfortable armchairs and big cups of coffee or tea.\u201d\u201cSara couldn\u2019t help but think that she had somehow missed the moment when life was meant to begin. For a long time she had simply been drifting through it, reading, and while everyone around her had been teenaged, unhappy and foolish, this hadn\u2019t been a problem. But then suddenly everyone had grown up around her and she, she had done nothing but read.\u201dI was delighted to win a free advanced copy through Goodreads First Reads.I enjoyed this interview with the author."}, {"userName": "Connie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie", "userReview": "I had my doubts about this book when I started it since there were so many improbable events, but it ended being a cute light story. Sara, a bookseller from Sweden, has been a pen pal with Amy, an older woman and book lover from the tiny town of Broken Wheel, Iowa. When Sara loses her job, Amy invites her for a visit for two months. Sara arrives in Iowa to find that Amy had recently died, but Amy's friends want to entertain her for her vacation. To repay the people for their generosity, Sara volunteers to open a small bookstore using the thousands of books that Amy had collected over the years. Sara seems very comfortable in a small town setting, and enjoys getting to know the quirky people. She also likes to match the people with the right book in the store. When her two months visa is almost up, her new friends find that they want Sara to stay since she has brightened their lives so much. \"It was as though the town needed a center, something to gather around, and Sara had filled the void Amy had left behind, with Amy's shop and her books and her almost universal kindness.\"(344)Even though there were a number of unlikely events and a predictable ending, the book was sweet and entertaining. It told about the importance of friendship and the pleasure people receive from reading. It should bring a smile to the face of a reader looking for a light beach read."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth of Silver's Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1882027-elizabeth-of-silver-s-reviews", "userReview": "\"This one's on me.\"How many times would Sara hear that?

What she finds though on her arrival is much more than she bargained for. Firstly the romantic thoughts of relaxing and reading with her friend are put on hold after the shock news that Amy has recently passed away and secondly Broken Wheel is a shadow of it's former self.Sara is shocked by what she finds and is totally overwhelmed by the hospitality of the locals who not only allow her to stay in Amy's house, but also refuse to let her pay for anything. After a bit of thought Sara realises that the only way to give back is by opening a store and sharing Amy's books with the town. Although slow on the intake, when Broken Wheels civil pride is at stake after bad words from neighbouring town Hope, the resident's rally to the cause and bring out the best in everyone. One thing that's clear is that Sara's arrival has brought new life to Broken Wheel and when the immigration office threaten to take her away, little do they know this is a town that will not allow itself to fall apart again, as they come up with a clever and hilarious roost to ensure Sara stays for good.Author Katarina Bivald, has filled the pages with literary goodness, with lines from Austen, Bridget Jones and many others, but it's Broken Wheel and it's people that make the story. Sara for one is brilliant as the unassuming heroine who not only grows as the book goes along but also gives wonderful views on the towns folks. Amy's nephew, Tom, George, Caroline and the rest all have their own emotional scars to bear that Sara and her books in some little ways heal.
