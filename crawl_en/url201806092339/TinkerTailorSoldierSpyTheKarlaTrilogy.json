How am I supposed to maintain this level of paranoia with this level of incompetence?\" Tweet from jkeeten's defunct Twitter account.\"I don't smoke but I always travel w/ a Zippo lighter in case I have to light a beautiful woman's cigarette or the wick of a Molotov cocktail.\" Another tweet from jkeeten's defunct Twitter account.The British Secret Service, resembling a corporation that has suffered sagging profits, has reshuffled key players, ousted others, and in the process forced George Smiley into retirement. Smiley, in his twilight years, could have easily decided to take up gardening or researching an interesting point of history, but he has wife problems. Ann has left him, leaving him to cover her missing presence with little lies and subterfuge. Given his past he is quite good at it. He is somewhat surprised to discover how much he misses her given the problems she continues to create for him. He has spent a lifetime controlling his emotions, but she is quite good at making him suffer.\"Putting on the hall light, he stooped and peered through his post. One \"account rendered\" from his tailor for a suit he had not ordered but that he suspected was one of those presently adorning Ann's lover; one bill from a garage in Henley for her petrol (what, pray, were they doing in Henley); one letter from the bank regarding a local cashing facility in favour of the Lady Ann Smiley at a branch of the Midland Bank of Immingham. And what the devil, he demanded of this document are they doing in Immingham?Who ever had a love affair in Immingham, for goodness' sake? Where was Immingham?\"He is of course angry. What person wants to see the results of their spouses affair through a series of bills or in today's world credit card receipts? Smiley talks tough.\"And if Ann wanted to return--well, he would show her the door.\"But when he is honest with himself.\"Or not show her the door, according to--well, how much she wanted to return.\"With almost a sigh of relief, Smiley is summoned to interrogate an agent that has stumbled upon bit of intelligence hinting at the existence of a deep cover mole in the service (so much for retirement). This begins a cat and mouse game showing Smiley at his best sifting through incomplete files, weighing the validity of whispers, and chasing a ghost agent back into the Circus. Smiley is some what of an enigma to work with. One of his loyal followers Peter Guillam gives us some insight. \"He spoke as if you followed his reasoning, as if you were inside his mind all the time.\" Smiley is really fighting a war on two fronts with his enemies within the service and with the subterfuge of the Karla organization. All players would like Smiley off the board. This novel is almost as complex as a Russian novel. There are a lot of names to assimilate early, don't despair, they start to sort themselves out as the plot advances. There is a lot of spy jargon. Babysitters, coat trailing, honey-pot, housekeepers, janitors, lamplighters, lotus eaters, mailfist jobs, pavement artists, reptile fund, scalphunters, shoemakers, and wranglers to name a few. You will come away feeling like you have a working knowledge of what it would really be like to be a spy. John Le Carre is the grand master of spy craft in my opinion, and there simply isn't a better example of his skillful plotting than this book. \nRead the book then watch the movie and if you want more watch the mini-series. If you are like me it might take all three just to feel like you have found every gem, and every clue that Le Carre so liberally sprinkled through this historical work of fiction. There are two more books in the Karla series...The Honourable Schoolboy and Smiley's People. I for one plan to follow Smiley every step of the way.If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit http://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at: https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten"}, {"userName": "Manny", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny", "userReview": "I'm one of many people who think that Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is the greatest espionage novel of all time. Let's take the obvious things first. Unlike most examples of this genre, it's extremely well-written. Also, having worked in espionage himself, le Carr\u00e9 is able to get the atmosphere right. It feels 100% authentic, and you see that spying is like most other jobs. The greater part of it is routine and office intrigues, though every now and then something unexpected and dramatic happens.So, even if there were nothing more to it, I'd still say that this book was very good. What makes it great is that the author isn't content with giving you a realistic account of what it's like to be a spy. He's gone much further than that, and written a book that's not just about espionage, which most people never come into contact with, but about betrayal, which we see all the time. The thing about betrayal is that you're generally aware that it's happening before you know how, or why, or who. Things used to be good, and now they're not, and you know that even if you do figure out what's happened you'll never be able to put it right. At best, you'll be able to cut your losses, and move on. In TTSS, the main character, George Smiley, is being betrayed in two different ways. First, it's gradually become clear that there is a mole in his department. It can only be someone at the very highest level. One of his most trusted colleagues, someone he has worked with for years, and shared things with, and treated as a friend, is actually working for the Russians. They have it narrowed down to four people. He has to find out which one it is, and do what's necessary. And, at the same time, he's also realized that his wife is sleeping around. He can't really prove anything, and they never talk about it. But he knows that too.I can imagine any number of clumsy, over-obvious ways to link up these threads. Le Carr\u00e9 does it with a very light touch. You see these two things happening, and every now and then there is an echo of correspondence. He wants you to be a spy too, and put together the little bits of evidence until you reach a conclusion. It's a book that completely transcends the genre, and shows how a writer who has enough talent can achieve stunning results in any medium. Strongly recommended to anyone who's ever been betrayed, or themselves betrayed a person they're close to. Which, unfortunately, is most of us."}, {"userName": "Jason", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4426615-jason", "userReview": "A few months ago a stylish looking British adaptation of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy was released in theaters and I was intrigued. But I knew better. Movies are for smart people. If I had to constantly nudge my wife during Superbad to ask questions like, \u201cso who is that guy again?\u201d and \u201cwait, is she the same one from before?\u201d then I had to admit that seeing this movie would only serve to make me feel very confused and intellectually inadequate. I do better with books. Books explain things. Books are for people who need a little, uh, help in the hand-holding department. So like any other self-respecting moron, I decided to read the book instead (or at least, before seeing the movie)\u2014that way I could have everything explained to me nice, nice.But I was duped.When my friend asked me to go with him to see Tinker Tailor, I told him it was not possible. I explained my reasoning while he nodded agreeably, accepting my oddities without judgment. But then he said, \u201cI think you\u2019ll find this to be an exception to your rule. In this particular case, you\u2019re going to want to have seen this movie before reading the book. Trust me.\u201d What. A Freaking. Liar.As soon as those last two words were uttered, warning bells should have gone off in my head. But I took him at his word and went to see a movie with the most convoluted plot I\u2019d ever tried to absorb. 120 minutes later I had a raging migraine.I now understood the lengths to which someone would go in order to have a companion at the movies. I suppose I can\u2019t begrudge a man that small favor, and I was not entirely the worse for wear\u2014800 mg of ibuprofen and a good night\u2019s sleep restored my faculties wonderfully. And that\u2019s when I decided to read the book.John le Carr\u00e9\u2019s novel retains all the plot complexity of the movie and then some, but it is delivered in such a way that is digestible. Even though I knew the fate of Colin Firth\u2019s character, my pulse still raced at the novel\u2019s climax. The author opens up a world of secrets, lies, espionage, and scandal that are somewhat missing from my everyday life, but seem to be more or less commonplace in a Europe engulfed in the Cold War. Mistrust and paranoia run as naturally as snowfall in New England. I am generally very glad to have read this book despite having done so after seeing the movie."}, {"userName": "Jaline", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7234171-jaline", "userReview": "Spy novels may be best consumed in large gulps by me. There is no question that John Le Carr\u00e9 is a brilliant writer, and his plots are peppered with surprise spirals throughout each novel.The one difficulty I had with this book was in the beginning, and it was my own difficulty. I had to quickly re-acquaint myself with British idiom, with spy jargon, distinguish between those two \u2018languages\u2019, and process many new players and how they related to characters I already knew from the previous 4 books in this series.Since I wasn\u2019t very good at it, the beginning part of this book went slowly for me. Not the book\u2019s internal pacing, of which John Le Carr\u00e9 is a master, but my own. Trying to keep up to the book while deciphering everything I needed to know was a challenge.Once I got a handle on the languages and the cast of characters, I was able to get on board this spy train and what a great ride it was! Control knew there was a mole somewhere in the upper echelon, and he knew it was one of five people and their code names were assigned from the \u2018Tinker, Tailor\u2019 children\u2019s rhyme. George Smiley (Beggarman) was one of the five. However, after Control died and there was a changing of the guard regarding running their Operations (including George Smiley\u2019s dismissal from service), the mole now had to be one of the remaining four. George Smiley\u2019s assignment is to find out who that person is.Once I had grasped all the background information, this book flew by in a series of fascinating \u2018interviews\u2019, action sequences, and other events that all played a role in drawing George Smiley closer to his quarry. In the end, this was a very enjoyable and satisfying read. I am also looking forward to the next book in the series as there are likely to be many more changes for George Smiley to sort through and contribute to."}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane", "userReview": "I'm going to state the obvious and say John le Carr\u00e9 is a really good writer.This was my first le Carr\u00e9 novel, and I can see why he's considered such a master of the spy genre. The story itself was thrilling, but what I most appreciated were his thoughtful descriptions. The writing was so insightful that it was easy to become invested in the fate of the characters.A quick plot summary: George Smiley is a retired British spy. He was forced out during a reorganization of the Circus, a nickname for the intelligence service. One day he's approached and asked to discreetly investigate a mole in the agency, someone who's been giving state secrets to Russia. George sets to work, getting help from some trusted colleagues. It was exciting watching George uncover the mole. Even though I knew the ending because I had seen the movie, it was still thrilling. Now that's good writing.But this wasn't just a book about finding a double agent \u2014 no, this was book about friendship, love and loyalty. It's about having a purpose in life. And it's about betrayal.They shared no harmony. They had lost all calmness in one another's company; they were a mystery to each other, and the most banal conversation could take strange, uncontrollable directions.Besides Smiley, my favorite character in the book was young Bill Roach, a student at a prep school. Roach is a good watcher, and quietly observes things others don't notice. For example, Roach observes some odd behavior by the school's new teacher, Jim Prideaux, which suggests he has some secrets. Here's an (abbreviated) early exchange between Jim and Bill that first showed me how well le Carr\u00e9 could write his characters:\"What are you good at, Bill?\"\"I don't know, sir,\" said Roach woodenly.\"Got to be good at something, surely; everyone is. How about football? Are you good at football, Bill?\"\"No, sir,\" said Roach.\"What's your best thing, then?\"Now this was an unfortunate question to ask of Roach just then, for it occupied most of his waking hours. Indeed he had recently come to doubt whether he had any purpose on earth at all. In work and play he considered himself seriously inadequate; even the daily routine of the school, such as making his bed and tidying his clothes, seemed to be beyond his reach. Also he lacked piety: old Mrs. Thursgood had told him so; he screwed up his face too much at chapel. He blamed himself for the break-up of his parents' marriage, which he should have seen coming and taken steps to prevent.Damn, that's a good introduction of a character. Rereading it, it's no wonder my heart went out to young Bill so early in the book. Speaking of strong introductions, check out this one for Smiley:Unlike Jim Prideaux, Mr. George Smiley was not naturally equipped for hurrying in the rain, least of all at dead of night. Indeed, he might have been the final form for which Bill Roach was the prototype. Small, podgy, and at best middle-aged, he was by appearance one of London's meek who do not inherit the earth. His legs were short, his gait anything but agile, his dress costly, ill-fitting, and extremely wet. His overcoat, which had a hint of widowhood about it, was of that black loose weave which is designed to retain moisture. Either the sleeves were too long or his arms were too short, for, as with Roach, when he wore his mackintosh, the cuffs all but concealed the fingers. For reasons of vanity he wore no hat, believing rightly that hats made him ridiculous.My one criticism of the writing is that the reader has to quickly adapt to the spy jargon, much of it made up by le Carr\u00e9. I thought it was interesting he was inspired to write this novel because of Kim Philby, a real-life double agent. I recently read Ben Macintyre's book on Philby, A Spy Among Friends, which made me keen to read Tinker, Tailor. And now I want to read the rest of the George Smiley series. John le Carr\u00e9 is such a popular writer that I hardly need to say this, but I highly recommend this novel to anyone who likes spy thrillers. Favorite Quotes\"He imagined that, like himself, Jim had had a great attachment that had failed him and that he longed to replace. But here Bill Roach's speculation met a dead end: he had no idea how adults loved each other.\"\"He would set up as a mild eccentric, discursive, withdrawn, but possessing one or two lovable habits such as muttering to himself as he bumbled along pavements. Out of date, perhaps, but who wasn't these days? Out of date, but loyal to his own time. At a certain moment, after all, every man chooses: will he go forward, will he go back? There was nothing dishonourable in not being blown about by every little modern wind. Better to have worth, to entrench, to be an oak of one's own generation.\"\"There are always a dozen reasons for doing nothing ... There is only one reason for doing something. And that's because you want to.\"\"There are old men who go back to Oxford and find their youth beckoning to them from the stones. Smiley was not one of them.\"\"He was of that pre-war set that seemed to have vanished for good, which managed to be disreputable and high-minded at the same time.\"\"I have a theory which I suspect is rather immoral ... Each of us has only a quantum of compassion. That if we lavish our concern on every stray cat, we never get to the centre of things.\"\"Sitting is such an eloquent business; any actor will tell you that. We sit according to our natures. We sprawl and straddle, we rest like boxers between rounds, we fidget, perch, cross and uncross our legs, lose patience, lose endurance.\"\"If there's one thing that distinguishes a good watcher from a bad one... it's the gentle art of doing damn all convincingly.\"\"Survival, as Jim Prideaux liked to recall, is an infinite capacity for suspicion.\"\"He wondered whether there was any love between human beings that did not rest upon some sort of self-delusion.\""}, {"userName": "Agnieszka", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2446508-agnieszka", "userReview": "Who can spy on the spies ?

Former agent George Smiley is called back from retirement to ferret him out. This is more of a psychological suspense novel than an action-filled James Bond spy thriller. Smiley is getting up there in years and though he's conversant with a handgun, he's not about to go galavanting about blasting up the countryside. The whole novel is much more sedate than you might expect when you think of \"spy thriller\". And yet in ways, this book is undeniably thrilling!Here, I think this passage from Wikipedia explains it better:Most of Cornwell's novels are spy stories set during the Cold War (1945\u201391) and feature Circus agents as unheroic political functionaries aware of the moral ambiguity of their work and engaged in psychological more than physical drama.[21] Cornwell's books emphasise the fallibility of Western democracy and of the secret services protecting it, often implying the possibility of East-West moral equivalence.[21] Moreover, they experience little of the violence typically encountered in action thrillers and have very little recourse to gadgets. Much of the conflict is internal, rather than external and visible.When you read a book like this, you get the distinct impression that the author has lived this life. Frankly, it was quite clear to me that John le Carr\u00e9 worked in the secret service. You can't whip out that kind of jargon and insight with only a casual acquaintance with the topic. I've read a few spy novels before and this makes them look childish in comparison.The writing itself is topnotch. The character crafting, the stage setting, and the nuance of plot all come off so seamlessly. If there was a little more action, it wouldn't go amiss, but lack of action aside, Le Carr\u00e9 pens books that are an absolute pleasure to read."}, {"userName": "Bill  Kerwin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83582-bill-kerwin", "userReview": "Whenever I think of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, I inevitably think of love: love that grants fortitude, love that clouds judgment, love that scars the soul and roots the heart. Although it is my experience of the book that guides me, it perhaps also has to do with the 1979 BBC miniseries, with the way Alec Guinness appears stolid and wounded, like an animal to the slaughter hit in the head with a hammer, with each inevitable mention of his wife\u2019s beauty, each smirking hint at her chain of adulteries.Of course the book is about many other things besides love: it is about the mysterious nature of allegiances and the way they change over time; about social class as an inescapable system of markers and man\u2019s bathetic attempts to emphasize or erase them; about how the look of a system subtly changes when it begins to betray itself; about how the illusions which make a man vulnerable also help him survive.Still, though, the book is about love: George\u2019s love for Ann of course, but Roach\u2019s love for his teacher too, Jim\u2019s love for Bill Haydon, Bill\u2019s love for himself, the outsider Percy\u2019s love for the insider's power, barren Connie\u2019s love for all her \u201cboys.\u201d Yes, on this much Karla and Smiley may agree: it is \u201clast illusion of the illusionless man,\u201d love.Above all the other loves in the book, though, there is one love who binds closest to herself those whom she betrays, the compromised goddess who requires devotion most particularly from her disillusioned devotees. Smiley, true to Ann, is true to her as well: Brittania, old England herself."}, {"userName": "Patrick Brown", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/175283-patrick-brown", "userReview": "I had read \nThe Spy Who Came In From the Cold\n on my honeymoon in Paris, and I remember liking it, but not rushing out to get more Le Carre. Well, now I'm going to rush out to get more Le Carre. I didn't give this five stars because it was a touch slow to get moving. I think if I'd just been able to focus a little more, I would've been into the plot faster. Le Carre has this ability to make every character a mystery. So much is withheld from the reader, and yet the characters are fascinating. I think what put me off about the beginning of the book is that I became very interested in Jim Prideaux, then had to shift gears to Smiley. Eventually, I got into the Smiley stuff, but at first, I just kept waiting for Prideaux to come back, and he didn't for a good long while.The way Le Carre describes the \"secret world\" of intelligence work is just incomparable. The details, the jargon (which, in the introduction, he reveals he mostly made up! Incredible!), it's so engrossing, I can't think of a reading experience that approximates it. Except maybe porn. My personal favorite scene in the story is when Peter Guillam steals the Operation Testify file from the Circus archives. That the archives of Britain's intelligence service are located on a street of shops, next to a coffee shop, and marked as a teacher's entrance for a school or something like that. Not guarded, in the traditional sense, no big barriers around it. Just a door that you'd never notice. Unless of course you'd been told to notice it. That's the essence of Le Carre, and precisely what makes this book so damn great."}, {"userName": "Willow ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4529669-willow", "userReview": "Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is not my type of book. I never read stuff like this. I don\u2019t like contemporaries (unless there are vampires or witches in them) and I rarely read mysteries. I loved the movie though (I\u2019m a big Gary Oldman fan) so I thought what the heck, I\u2019ll read the book. After all, it\u2019s not really a contemporary\u2026at least not anymore. The action takes place during the early seventies. So here I am.First off, I have to say Le Carre writes with amazing detail. These guys aren\u2019t like regular characters. They\u2019re like real people with complex motives, their own dialect, and little nuances that are personal to them. I got to know them, slowly, intuitively, especially since Le Carre never tells you what you should think of them or explains them. He just lets the reader develop their own opinion. You get to know everybody though dialogue and body language -- little tidbits like how someone sits down on a child\u2019s swing set. It\u2019s excellent! That\u2019s not to say it wasn\u2019t disorienting though. At first I felt like I had started a new job. I'm meeting all these new people, there are new rules, and there\u2019s a whole new work lingo I have to learn. I was a bit lost at first, trying to keep track of names and figure out what people were saying (especially since I\u2019m not a Brit.) There are so many characters, and no one can be cataloged in a nice neat box. To my surprise though, this sense of confusion actually made me pay closer attention. I loved being just thrown in there. I do believe it hit me on a deeper level too since I dreamed about this book. :DWere the characters likable? Yes and no. I liked Smiley a lot, but I would hate to work with him. He\u2019s too tight-lipped and ruthless. You\u2019d never know where you\u2019d stand with him. He\u2019s also waaay too observant, looking for everyone\u2019s weaknesses. It was great being inside his head though. You can tell he unnerves people. That\u2019s why so many people take a certain glee in telling him his wife is sleeping with someone else. They want to needle him. The other characters were great too. Percy is a worm. Jim is tragic and compelling. I couldn\u2019t stand Bill. I thought Ricky was a hoot, even though he\u2019s an ass. As you can see, I definitely had an opinion about everybody. Of course, all these different motives and dynamics make the book seem strangely complicated, yet the story is simple. There\u2019s a mole in the secret service which has made everyone paranoid, and George Smiley is trying to lure him out and trap him. There are a lot of mind games.This brings me to the part of the book though, which I think was lacking. There\u2019s not much suspense. Maybe if I hadn\u2019t seen the movie, I would have been more curious to find out who the mole was, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s it. I think the lack of action and danger made this a somewhat dry read. I would have never finished it if I hadn\u2019t seen the movie. The beginning is slow. And while yes there are conversations and confrontations that are dynamic and thrilling, not much happens. That\u2019s why I knocked a star.  On the whole though, I\u2019m very much impressed. Le Carre is a great writer. I want to read Smiley\u2019s People because I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s even better than this book.

First I was in one character's head, then another, then back to the first. Then there was a third character who mostly made cameo appearances and was clearly unimportant, but we spend time in his head too. As if that's not confusing enough, different people narrate different parts of the story as master spy George Smiley (highly distracting name, I must say) interviews different players who describe their experiences to him. Sometimes we're flashing back to George's memories; sometimes we're learning what George is reading in the archives in the present day although it feels like it might be a flashback. Eventually this all ties together, but I lacked the patience or motivation to understand how or why. The absence of a character about whom I cared even a little only added to my increasing disengagement from and disenchantment with the book. I spent most of the book wanting to quit but persevering in the hope that I would eventually get why this was a great book.

For espionage thrillers, this is as good as it gets. The setting is the Cold War, and both the Britain and Russia are tired but still engaging in lethal combat by spy. One central theme that I did not appreciate before this re-read is that the primary conflict, even when Le Carre tells the story from a British POV, is not between British spies and the Russians, but between Russia and America, with British spies taking sides, not always as expected. The conflict between personal and patriotic motives plays out dramatically in each of the major characters. I can't close without a word of pity for poor Smiley, whose wife has apparently become a promiscuous tramp. Was this transition described in one of the other Smiley books?

So although I enjoyed them immensely, when I was all finished (and even during the reading) I felt confused about what story le Carre had actually told.So a couple years ago I watched (Netflix) the BBC adaptation of the books with Alec Guinness. Again, I enjoyed it no end, but while the 7 hour condensation of the story had to have a much simplified plot, I again felt (during and after) that I wasn't fully comprehending the story.These experiences I think say something about the problems I have always had with short term memory. I am left with the question, do I read the books again, with extra attention, or note-taking, or whatever, to see if I can finally comprehend the entire magnificent labyrinth that le Carre has constructed in these books? I would love to, but life is short, especially at my age. It's hard not to conclude that time would be better spent (even more enjoyably?) reading things that I've never read, or rereading some of the books that I have both enjoyed as much as the Karla novels, and been able to get more out of.

So Smiley has not retired with dignity, but rather has been ousted for backing a jaded horse. The head of Circus, a spy so skilled that people only knew him as \"Control,\" went out in a blaze of tragedy, and Smiley's career was one of the casualties.Unknown to most, Control was trying to find a mole. He failed and the Circus has been reorganized. Now, however, one of the Circus's spies surfaces with a suspicious tale of betrayal. In Hong Kong, he has heard rumors of a mole placed right at the top of the Circus. So who watches the watchmen?George Smiley does.As far as spies go, George Smiley is as far removed from James Bond and Jason Bourne as we can imagine. For one thing, George is over the hill. For another, George's wife, Ann, has cheated on him many times. In fact, one character that slept with Ann explains that he just joined the \"queue.\" George Smiley is a man whose most distinguishing feature may well be his glasses.Which is another way of saying that we're invited to consider what's going on inside of Smiley's head -- and he's a master spy, so consider carefully. I quite like the way that le Carre illustrates Smiley's inner world. One early description of Smiley, who is struggling not to rot in his retirement, caught my eye:He would set up as a mild eccentric, discursive, withdrawn, but possessing one or two lovable habits such as muttering to himself while he bumbled along pavements. Out of date, perhaps, but who wasn\u2019t these days? Out of date, but loyal to his own time. At a certain moment, after all, every man chooses: will he go forward, will he go back? There was nothing dishonorable in not being blown about by every little modern wind. Better to have worth, to entrench, to be an oak of one\u2019s own generationWell said, though this is a message that 21st century readers might struggle to understand. \"'Not being blown about by every little modern wind?' Huh?\"In many ways, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy has the feel of a novel that was written in a past age. Its atmosphere is dominated by the bitter paranoia of the Cold War, spies rely on tapes with tape in them to record incriminating evidence, and files are made out of printed paper that was typed by a human being using a typewriter. This is a world in which the English Empire still exists within the living memory of England's citizens, as opposed to dusty archives of post-colonial libraries.Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is not a novel for readers seeking the action-adventurer. Instead, this is a book for readers interested in an unusual spy novel. Le Carre discusses aging, betrayal, and resilience, as opposed to coming of age, vengeance, and persistence."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65909643-michael", "userReview": "How amazing--a spy novel where virtually nothing happens, and yet it's compelling and suspenseful nonetheless.

It reined supreme. The reading public had never seen anything quite like it. Everyone knew John LeCarre was a spy writer and that he was 'rather good'. Everyone--absolutely everyone--was aware of the landmark, the juggernaut which he had already achieved some years previously: 'The Spy Who Came in From the Cold'. But no one --I think--expected him to equal that triumph; no one expected him to follow that book with anything else as noteworthy. 'Cold' had made the spy genre newly-impeccable; it brought espionage fiction up to the caliber of any fiction being written anywhere in the British-speaking world. It was a tremendous feat. And then there were a few years which went by... and then LeCarre comes up with this amazing book. Most people were probably only vaguely aware that his books were a continuing series; with an established set of re-appearing characters. But they really didn't know what this meant; they really didn't know what LeCarre was truly capable of until this title hit the market; and then everyone got it. It suddenly became clear really, what a spy novel could do; what a spy novel could encompass. LeCarre--in really a masterful, quiet, devoted manner--really crafted something special here. For the first time (I believe) readers were treated to something quite new. 'Tinker, Tailor' continues the dramatic arc of a narrative premise which LeCarre started writing more than 10 years prior; when he created the 'George Smiley' hero; when he created some of the other figures in his fictional world of British espionage services. The plot of 'Tinker' reaches backwards in time and brings those characters forward...and really, this is the heart of LeCarre's technique. For, LeCarre's characters are 'just-like-us'; in that their lives span out across events and histories. Each 'Tinker' character has a rich interior life, extending backwards into the past, fanning out behind them. The novel wends its way among a jumble of poignant little mnemonic fragments which is tied to each figure drawn by LeCarre; fragments maybe mentioned only briefly in a completely previous LeCarre work, from years ago. Half-remembered allusions; scraps of near-forgotten admissions or confessions, confidences: this is how the Smiley-book plots must always resolve themselves. Never with a daring escape or assassination; always by 'reflection'. Ultimately, all LeCarre books are based on a trail of breadcrumbs dropped from the previous sequence of ...all his previous books. LeCarre makes new use of these crusts with every new outing. They become the caked, muddy foreground for each new mystery which Smiley must solve, as he must do here in 'Tinker'. So--for the reader--there's this wonderful redolence from seeing faintly-familiar names re-mentioned; hearing characters discuss their old history with each other. This is just as it happens in real life, and in real relationships. LeCarre-characters have palpable memories; they are always 'reaching back'; re-tracing their steps; re-playing past decisions and accidents and turning-points and gestures from LeCarre books which you last read perhaps five years earlier .Really, by the time 'Tinker' was released, reading leCarre novels had become a kind of 'collaborative pursuit' that each reader participated in alongside LeCarre and Smiley--a sort of investment on a personal level--purely from having read all those previous LeCarre romps. No other genre-author had the creativity to provide this sense of 'shared history' for readers; the built-up residuum of life which leCarre's introspective hero--George Smiley--must sift through as he goes about his discouraging investigatory task. Smiley must research the history of his friendships in this yarn; all his colleagues; his marriage; his friends. Basically, there is a Soviet mole in his department--the most devious mole ever--and it must be discovered whom--and the only way to do it, is with Smiley's particular brand of soul-searching. The materiele for that introspection is what we know well and care about fondly (if we've been reading Le Carre at all). George Smiley is an old friend, almost 'family'. We join in Smiley's urgent, private hunt for that suspected, hidden figure, the alleged burrower who--if he exists--has manipulated Smiley's life and his career for years. As Smiley burns; we burn.So, we enter into the 'Tinker' plot with an eagerness such as few stories of any kind in modern British lit, can invoke. For--when Smiley catches his enemy--he will solve in one stroke both a national problem and a personal problem. Smiley has been wounded on two levels by this mystery-figure (both 'officially' and 'inwardly').['Tinker' thus reminds us of one reason why espionage-fiction is the most literary of any genre. It reflects our concerns for our outward, external, social institutions and also treats the needs of our inward self; the psychology of the isolated citizen. In this way, LeCarre's writing is somewhat heir to fiction like that of Dostoevsky: he deals with 'man vs man' and also, 'man vs state'.]Back to my discourse: the 'inward' character-mining technique of LeCarre's came out previously in \"Cold\". The trial of poor Alec Leamas in East Germany hinged on a scrap of circumstance mentioned one installment earlier in 'Call for the Dead'--the cryptic 'business trip' by Hans-Dieter Mundt. But here, in 'Tinker' this 'back-pedaling of memory' is exercised even more vigorously. Why are leCarre plots always recounted via retrospect? Because the elusive quarry is never 'one of them'. Smiley realizes (to his grief) that the man is 'one of us'. He's not some wily, slippery, dirty foreigner in some distant land which our agents must go out and destroy in 'James Bond'-fashion. Indeed not. The evildoer, the enemy, the culprit in 'Tinker' is ..one of the members of our own establishment. And in order to unmask that infiltrator, Smiley has to ruminate upon whole swathes of British culture and society. [In a sense, this is why any 'agency mole' story is so rewarding. It forces (as no other genre trope does) a session of self-study; forces you to gaze at your own society to spot all the covered-up falsehoods.]Perhaps only in Dickens' novels do impassioned characters and their schemes cross lengthy intervals and lifetimes--do such 'feeling' agendas appear. LeCarre's semi-Dickensian technique radiated a new depth to the traditional spy story in a way that pays faith entirely to itself--to LeCarre himself (as an author, a citizen, and a man) and to his genre of choice. The resulting novel is a savory reading experience which satisfies fully well on its own, but--as a further laurel to the career of the man who had just written, 'In from the Cold'--well, its really just astounding. In two swift strokes, John LeCarre gave us the definitive 'defector' novel and the definitive 'mole' novel. Think about how singular that is; and understand why no one can touch LeCarre in his chosen genre."}, {"userName": "Nigeyb", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10301421-nigeyb", "userReview": "I've wanted to read the George Smiley books since watching the BBC adaptation of 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy' back in the 1970s. I subsequently loved the 2011 film adaptation directed by Tomas Alfredson, which I saw in the cinema, and rewatched a few weeks ago. Everything I had heard about the source material suggested joy and wonder would await and, so far, I\u2019m pleased to report, that\u2019s exactly what I have found.I have read the series, up until 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy', in quick succession\u2026'Call for the Dead' (1961) A really intelligent, beautifully written novel, and a great introduction to the Smiley books. 'A Murder of Quality' (1962)Beautifully written and expertly plotted, it also takes a razor sharp scalpel to snobbery and the British class system, and has a pleasingly authentic and complex psychological dimension. 'The Spy Who Came In from the Cold' (1963)Treats the reader as sharp witted and bright enough to keep up. It is magnificent. Beautifully and economically written, and dealing in politics, intrigue and what it is to be human. A bold claim, but all life is here. It\u2019s dark, very dark, but quite brilliant too. 'The Looking Glass War' (1965)John le Carr\u00e9 lays bare snobbery, vanity, a sense of denial and delusion, repressed emotions, faded dreams, and incompetence. It's often hard to read, but remains grimly compelling throughout. It\u2019s exactly what John le Carr\u00e9 set out to write: a more truthful novel that captured the internal politics, the little Englander mentality, and the complacency of the mid-1960s UK intelligence service. And thus to 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy' (1974)\u2026.Smiley has a habit of being dragged out of retirement, and so it is here, where the possibility of a long term Russian spy has emerged once more, and the list of suspects has been narrowed down to four wise men, each with a code name culled from a nursery rhyme: Percy Alleline (Tinker); Bill Haydon (Tailor); Roy Bland (Soldier); and Toby Esterhase (Poorman). Being John le Carr\u00e9, the hunt is ponderous and methodical, frequently conducted via old files and archives, with Smiley\u2019s most energetic act being to polish his spectacles on his tie, but - as with the other books - this is the essence of the book\u2019s appeal. This early description can only be our man...\"Small, podgy and at best middle-aged, he was by appearance one of London\u2019s meek who do not inherit the earth. His legs were short, his gait anything but agile, his dress costly, ill-fitting and extremely wet.\"Smiley's careful, thorough, cerebral, unrelenting methods and finely honed powers of deduction, cut through a complex and intriguing plot to skewer the traitor. And all this despite personal humiliations involving his feckless but beloved wife, and that his employers have, as so often before, shunted him out because of their failure to see his true worth. Needless to say Karla, his nemesis in the East German intelligence service, is only too aware of Smiley\u2019s unique qualities.This book is a joy from start to finish. A complete masterpiece and my favourite in the series to far. It is also the first of the Karla Trilogy. I cannot wait to read the rest of the series.5/5 Next up, 'The Honourable Schoolboy' (1977)"}, {"userName": "gaby", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/130698-gaby", "userReview": "And thus began what would be a year and a half-long obsession with George Smiley and his British Circus.

Le Carre has many strengths as a writer. The dialogue is crisp, idiosyncratic and understated. The scenes may as well be in HD- you can hear the rain beating against the window in Smiley's hotel room, and see the mastery and discipline in the eyes of an elusive spy who while being interrogated refuses to take even a single cigarette from a pack of his favorite brand placed on the table in front of him. Descriptions of people are almost always compact and interesting, miniature portraits:Taking the marble, he slowly rolled it round his hard, powdery palm, and Roach knew at once that he was very skillful at all sorts of things; that he was the kind of man who lived on terms with tools and objects generally.And, as in The Spy Who Came in From the Cold, the psychologies of the characters are compellingly rendered- one gets the sense that these are all more or less the same kinds of people, who just happen to live on opposite sides of the Berlin Wall. Their motivations, whether they realize it or not, are the thrill of sport, or personal bonds, or just certain character traits combined with unexamined loyalty to their countries. As Smiley thinks towards the end, \"...treason is very much a matter of habit.\" But so is service. I did find the structure to be kind of static. A majority of the novel (perhaps I'm wrong about this, but it did feel like it) seems to involve Smiley sitting in hotels or houses designated for use by British intelligence (otherwise known as the Circus), reading secret files, remembering things that have happened and thinking about people he's known, trying to figure out who Moscow's mole in the Circus might be. On one hand, this had the pleasant effect of simultaneously enabling two of my longtime fantasies- that of a) being a spy, and b) staying anonymously in a large hotel in a rainy city where no one knows my name nor can ask anything of me- but I also felt distanced from the characters, many of whom became (for me, anyway) hard to distinguish. While Smiley's thoughts towards the end about the mole's motivations (and maybe these can actually be read as Le Carre's thoughts about Kim Philby) are among my favorite passages in the novel-He spoke not of the decline of the West, but of its death by greed and constipation. He hated America very deeply, he said, and Smiley supposed he did. [He] also took it for granted that secret services were the only real measure of a nation's political health, the only real expression of its subconscious......[Smiley] tried at first to see [him] in the romantic newspaper terms of a thirties intellectual, for whom Moscow was the natural Mecca... ...[But then Smiley] remembered the ghost of [his] authoritarian father...and imagined [his] Marxism making up for his inadequacy as an artist and for his loveless childhood. Later, of course, it hardly mattered if the doctrine wore thin. [He] was set on the road...[and he] had loved it, too. Smiley didn't doubt that for a moment. Standing at the middle of a secret stage, playing world against world, hero and playwright in one: oh, [he] had loved that, all right.- the fact that I never felt as though I knew this character except through Smiley's reflections, and that I could hardly remember an actual scene in which he appeared, lessened the effect somewhat. But I basically enjoyed this, and will probably get around to reading the other books in the trilogy. The Spy Who Came in from the Cold blew me away, though. It's tighter, more harrowing, more pitiless, more singular. Tinker..., by contrast, feels to me like an author settling into an episodic structure with his main character- okay then, another case solved by George Smiley, now it's time to try to reconcile with the wife and go back to rising at noon, until the next crisis. Nothing wrong with that, but I still like the earlier novel better."}, {"userName": "Matt Brady", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7881793-matt-brady", "userReview": "The best espionage thriller I\u2019ve ever read. One of the greatest living British writers hardly needs me to talk him up, but I truly am in awe of le Carr\u00e9's skills.The plot is fairly simple. It\u2019s the early 70\u2019s and George Smiley, after a year of forced retirement, is tasked with uncovering the identity of a Soviet mole that has managed to infiltrate the highest echelons of the British secret service. But the amount of depth and complexity that le Carre manages to add to this story is remarkable, as is his cynical, authentic-feeling portrayal of the intelligence community.Smiley himself is a terrific character. Middle-aged, overweight he appears to be nothing more than an overworked, boring bureaucrat. A \u201cflabby oak tree\u201d as his loyal assistant Mendel describes him. But Smiley is also an incredibly gifted spy and a master interrogator, perfectly suited to the mole-hunt he is burdened with. Smiley\u2019s greatest talent is getting people to talk, and his methods seem simple. He listens. He pays attention. He notes social cues, and gives the appropriate response.\u201cThere was nothing but deference in Smiley\u2019s tone. No edge, no wish to score: only a wish to have the truth\u201dThe truth is always Smiley\u2019s ultimate goal, \u201ctreasure\u201d in the spy-jargon of the novel, and he will not let ambition or vanity or personal feelings keep him from it. He does anything to get his subject talking, and keep them talking. That is what the majority of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is, a series of one-on-one conversations with Smiley always poking, probing, manipulating, seeking the truth, digging for treasure. His personality and character emerge in fits and starts, almost incidentally, because Smiley isn\u2019t one to talk about himself much, to reveal his thoughts and emotions. His extreme passivity is his greatest weapon, allowing his interview subjects to project any kind of emotion or expectation or fear onto his bland countenance and calm demeanour. If this sounds boring, it isn\u2019t. Le Carr\u00e9 is a master at wringing every last drop of tension and drama from even the most seemingly mundane situations. In his hands, a conversation over a curry dinner is as exciting as a shootout, and the removal of a paper file from an office as tense as a prison break.If I was in a quibbling mood, the only minor flaw I could point to would be that le Carr\u00e9 isn\u2019t interested at all in holding the readers hand. He doesn\u2019t waste time with exposition. He throws you in headfirst to a fully realised world, complete with it\u2019s own language and jargon, and trusts you to figure things out. But I\u2019m not in a quibbling mood, because this book is marvelous, a dark, cynical glimpse into the deceptive and morally ambiguous world of spies that is probably far closer to reality than what we see in most movies or books on the subject."}, {"userName": "notgettingenough ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2658311-notgettingenough", "userReview": "Zoeb's comment below makes me add this:I got given all the le Carr\u00e9 books that existed at the time of a birthday in the early eighties.

There we were with our own Bill Hayden traitor in our midst.For those who aren't familiar with the story, our Bill was part of the Labour Whitlam Government that was sacked by the Governor General on behalf of the Queen in the mid-seventies. He was leader of the party for a while a bit later, becoming more to the right as time when on, culminating in accepting the position of - of all things - Governor General as an ironic end to his career.You wouldn't read about it.Later: the series was great and although I don't particularly understand how they got away with shortening it into a movie, that is well done too.

Think Joey in Friends, do you remember those jokes??...all the other Friends get \"it\" immediately and whatever \"it\" was takes that little bit longer to dawn on Joey.... The first part of this book made me feel like that. I was Joey! There was always so much going on and so many different character names, so many aliases, so much spy jargon ...it was just an awful lot to take in in the beginning. I felt like I needed cliffsnotes to help me through! And at times I even went to Wikipedia. Oh good ol' Wikipedia. It has a GREAT page on Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy with a fabulous jargon buster. Cos if you're anything like me you won't know your lamplighters from your janitors to your shoemakers....FYI that's surveillance people, operations staff and forgers!However, strangely enough, I think that this feeling of always being confused is the precise aim that the author had. This is a novel about good old fashioned espionage: Cold War spy tactics where the British are trying to spy on the Russians who are spying on the Americans etc etc and then there are double agents, double crosses and defectors selling information... So I guess the author was trying to get across the point that you can never be sure of the information you have nor the people you work with. Sometimes you only get fragmented parts of the facts and half-truths. You just can't trust everyone and someone somewhere is always out to trip you up. So I can understand why the beginning had to have a lot of smoke and mirrors to set the scene but I would have liked a glossary of terms or something!Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy was written and set in the early 70s. The main character, George Smiley, is a former spy who had been forced into retirement along with the former head of The Circus (MI6) due to the fallout from an \"international incident\". A senior civil service officer with responsibility for intelligence services approaches George Smiley with evidence that there is a mole high up in the ranks of the new leadership of MI6 who has been feeding information to the Russians and tasks George with rooting out the mole. This book is all about the slow reveal. It bombards the reader with a lot of information from the start and you have to pace yourself, read slowly and try to take it all in. Well at least I had to. There were many pages that I had to go back and reread and check who certain characters were again etc. The plot is scattered with clues and nuggets of information that little by little help to formulate a picture of how a mole may have infiltrated a secret service agency. So by just under half-way through the book I finally managed to get a handle on everything. Plot lines were beginning to come together. Characters' true identities were being unmasked. There were twists and turns and it was glorious!! Just glorious!!! I loved every minute of it. Yes it's a novel that requires patience and a lot of head scratching at times but the pay off is SO worth it... Because then all of a sudden various threads of what seemed to be unlinked plots all come together and it's all DING DING DING DING DING followed by a series of light bulbs flashing on in your head!!! And you then realise that it's just such a well written book and so carefully thought out. And by three quarters of the way through the book I couldn't turn the pages fast enough and I was constantly going 'oh my god, oh my god' and it all built up to this lovely crescendo of a final reveal. It was a very satisfying ending. I did not feel let down at all which I'm very relieved about!! All in all this was a hugely enjoyable book. My difficulties in grappling with the sheer volume of characters at the beginning stops me from giving this the full five stars. But I would urge anyone to read this book when they have a bit of time on their hands and want something a little more challenging. Stick with it!! It is so worth it. So I'm going to award it four and a half super stealthy and sleuth-worthy stars!I have a feeling that this is a book that would benefit from repeat readings.

The reader is dropped, as in other LeCarre novels, into the middle of the story, and must piece together the story from Smiley\u2019s own memories and those of others who, in one way or another have been exiled from their life\u2019s work . Gradually, Smiley finds that the promotion of an incompetent to the leadership of the service, and the banishment of those who were on the trail of the Soviet \u2018mole\u2019 are not merely the result of political and bureaucratic ineptitude, but the result of an ingenious and sinister conspiracy run by Smiley\u2019s nemesis, the Soviet spymaster Karla. This book is on my short list of yearly re-reads. It now feels as though the spy world LeCarre constructs is more the scaffolding for an unsparing examination of human betrayal in its many forms. Romantic, marital, parental, institutional and governmental structures are all corroded by the vanity, ambition and duplicity of the protagonists. LeCarre knows from brutal personal experience the cunning ambition at play in the upper levels of a government agency, and depicts it with an unsparing eye. He is respectful of his readers in simply presenting well rounded, often eccentric and very human characters and watching their actions without judgment. Characters tenuously holding on to their probity are the ones most likely to be used and discarded. The recent film, while admirable, simply hasn\u2019t the time to do justice to the varying motivations of the suspects under Smiley\u2019s scrutiny. Here, each gets a finely drawn portrait of resentment, class-consciousness, ambition and ruthlessness. When the mole is finally unmasked he presents an incoherent apologia of ideology and ego, in which he becomes more opaque than he was before. We see that far from the heroic but misguided figure we understood him to be, he is an empty vessel, the consequence of having been skillfully manipulated from afar for decades.I find the character of Jim Prideaux most intriguing, though his inner life remains a mystery. Always the loyal soldier, he willingly heads off on what is likely a suicide mission, though attempting to warn his colleagues of the danger it poses to the regime. We meet him in retirement, physically challenged and emotionally broken after his mission. He represents another approach to dealing with betrayal, through feigned toughness unable to mask a wounded, gentle heart. I was touched by his patient tenderness in dealing with the young student who idolizes him, while nonetheless retaining the capacity to snap the neck of his betrayer. I once knew a prominent artist who insisted that the rot of governments ultimately trickles down to poison the relations between individuals and within families. LeCarre's Cold War England embodies that notion. This is finally a melancholy and dispirited tale, one that has held me in its grip through many years."}], "description": "A modern classic in which John le Carr\u00e9 expertly creates a total vision of a secret world, Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy begins George Smiley's chess match of wills and wits with Karla, his Soviet counterpart.
