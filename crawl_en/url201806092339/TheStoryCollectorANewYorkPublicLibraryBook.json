One of my favorites. The writing was so vivid and the details made you feel like you were there. The author did an amazing job with the accuracy of the library, city, and characters (many of them, including the MC, were real). Such a fun read."}, {"userName": "Shannon Minner", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22018906-shannon-minner", "userReview": "Thanks to the publisher for the ARC in exchange for my honest review.Eleven-year-old Viviani Fedeler and her family live in the New York Public Library where her dad is the superintendent. She had her siblings are constantly playing in the stacks and being sushed by the librarians. Not only does Viviani love to read but she also loves to tell stories. That is until new student Merit Mubarak comes to town and calls her a liar. In her quest to prove herself Viviani sets out to trick Merit and there are disastrous results.Set in the 1920\u2019s and based on the real Fedeler family I thought this was a great story. I loved the timeline, photos, and authors note at the end. I also loved the chapter titles with their Dewey decimal number and alternate subject headings.For any library lover and story teller this is a must read."}, {"userName": "Ms. Yingling", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2636606-ms-yingling", "userReview": "E ARC from Edelweiss Plus"}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8729871-brenda", "userReview": "While I loved the idea of this book (a girl who LIVES in the NYPL!), I just couldn't get into it. The story seemed a little awkward to me. We don't find out until much later why she's writing to her \"friend\" and I didn't understand the story collector at first. I wish the story was developed a little better and maybe would have been more about Viviani's life, rather than her trying to trick a new girl."}, {"userName": "Andr\u00e9a", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8376001-andr-a", "userReview": "Note: I accessed a digital review copy of this book through Edelweiss."}], "description": "The Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E.
