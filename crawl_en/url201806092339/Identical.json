He was an alcoholic and a gambler. He had anger issues and extreme mood swings. He was liberal with his money at the race track and when he was out drinking with his buddies, but it was a big deal if my grandmother wanted a new dress or my mom needed a new pair of shoes. I always hated the way he treated my grandmother and my mother and hated the way they behaved when they were around him. I hated visiting my grandparents on Sundays after church and especially hated being left alone with my grandfather. He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 86. It was too good for him. Though I had no reservations about reading Tricks, some of the issues in Identical were a little too close to home for me, and I was afraid of triggering unwanted memories. My fear cast aside, I decided to borrow the unabridged audio version from the library. While my vague memories remained far in the past, I was able to feel a deep emotional connection with the characters. Ellen Hopkins must have teenagers of her own, or is very knowledgeable about the problems that can affect them. Her characters are solid, believable, and strong. As much as I enjoyed the narration, I find that the author's intimate writing style and loosely constructed free prose is meant to be read. After listening to the audio version, I borrowed the book just to see how the 16-year-old identical twins, Kaeleigh's and Raeanne's thoughts were shaped. The story is told in alternating perspectives by the twins and covers myriad teenage problems, including father-daughter incest, eating disorders, drug abuse, mental illness, promiscuity, and cutting. While the characters were easy to get to know, I found the issues covered a bit too overwhelming and excessive foreshadowing revealed a plot twist that was not a big surprise to me by the book's conclusion. Still, a mostly satisfying read and I look forward to Hopkins' other titles."}, {"userName": "Raeleen Lemay", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3452652-raeleen-lemay", "userReview": "I think this is Ellen Hopkins's most effed up book.

Very disturbing. I really like the author's style and I think the use of verse is highly effective and contributes something to the story that I never imagined possible... but. And there is a but. I felt this book, unlike Burned which I loved, just went too far. It made me feel uncomfortable, too much so. I can't explain, I usually really like books that are controversial and stretch boundaries but... a man performing oral sex on his daughter while her twin watched and secretly wished it was her? The revulsion I felt was too much. Way too much.I thought the plot idea was great, very interesting and a rather dangerous subject area to delve into (child abuse, amongst other things). Basically, it's the story of identical twins, almost completely alike except one is the reluctant centre of her father's attention... sexual attention. The other twin feels unloved by her father and longs to please him... even sexually. That was the part of this book that made my stomach churn, not so much the abuse of one twin but the incestuous desires of the other. I read it in a few hours and was gripped in a manner that can only be described as 'horrified'. I couldn't put it down, like the inability to look away from a road accident even after seeing a mangled body. Perhaps it should be given more stars, but I didn't really enjoy this book. Who knows? I'll probably read it again in the future and I might decide to revise this rating.

They are half of the All-American family, with a dad who is a judge and a mom who is running for a position in Congress. But what lies beneath their facade is really dysfunction; and the worst, worst kind.Kaeleigh, the introverted one, is being sexually abused by Ray, her own father, and also binges and cuts herself. Raeanne is the exact opposite and is more outgoing, but finds herself wanting the attention Kaeleigh always gets. So, she resorts to drugs, and lots, and lots of sex. And this is just the beginning of the horrible suffering the twins face in this book.As a teenager myself, I must admit that sometimes I cringed while reading the book and had to put it down for a second. However, I would immediately pick it right back up and continue reading. I strongly would recommend not giving this book out to teens under the age of 14; it's just THAT graphic at some parts of the story. Not bad, though.Ellen Hopkin's unique poetry style is commanding and flawlessly executed, and when the twin's viewpoint switches over the mirroring effect is awe-inspiring. (read the individual words as they go down the page.)The twist at the end was... wow. I remember the shock I experienced the first time I saw it. Overall, if you are a fan of Ellen Hopkin's previous works this will be another amazing read through, if not, then it won't hurt to give it a try. /end review"}, {"userName": "Melissa \u2665 Dog/Wolf Lover \u2665 Martin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin", "userReview": "www.melissa413readsalot.blogspot.comThis book was amazing and it tore me apart :( I had a feeling I knew where it was going and it did but in a little bit of a different way. It's so very sad. This author can write some amazing ~ heart-wrenching books.. the sad thing is she knows a lot of this stuff from experience. You have Kaeleigh and Raeanne that are twins and they both have such crappy lives that I almost have no words. It breaks me into pieces. *EXCERPT FROM BOOK*Eyes firmly planted on Daddy,who follows. Why does it have to be just the two of us here?I want my sister. I want my mom.Surely he won't trail me intomy room. Won't watch me undress.*END OF EXCERPT*The things that Kaeleigh endures while Raeanne has to watch and feels helpless is so atrocious, but it happens. Raeanne spiraling down the sex and drugs road. Kaeleigh... cutting..purging.......... Their mother is gone all of the time running her campaign. Their father is a judge and starts drinking when he comes home among other things. What happened to these people in their lifetimes? It's not a pretty story, all things come from somewhere... and someone is always the one to let it happen. I was so ripped to shreds by the end of this book and the ending is so broken. But it will be put back together.

In this case, Kaeleigh is sexually abused by her father while her twin sister, Raeanne, isn\u2019t. Raeanne never tells on her father, especially since her mother is distant {she\u2019s running for Congress} and cold. And the story, written in the same free verse Hopkins used in Crank and Glass, switches from the point of view of Kaeleigh to Raeanne. Of occasionally, if you follow the sepearate words down the page, the girls come to the same conclusion through different experiences and sometimes they repeat what one another has to say. \u201cAt ten, it isn\u2019t exactly easy to separate good touch from bad touch, proper love from improper love, doting daddy from perv.\u201d {pg. 241}When I started my review in my head towards the end of Identical, I was all set to complain about how indistinguishable Kaeleigh is from Raeanne and visa versa. The identical twins I know are completely distinguishable - in dress, mannerism, and voice. Raeanna and Kaeleigh are not, and I found myself flipping back and forth, back and forth between the pages to make sure who I thought was speaking was, in fact, speaking. But then I reached the end and my complaint was explained. At least, to a degree.You see, the ending in unexpected, unexplainable, and completely out there. At the end of the book, you learn that Raeanna actually died in the car accident caused by Ray and Kaeleigh has multiple identities, living through herself and her twin sister to cope with the sexual abuse. Now that I think about it, the book is riddled with clues: Raeanne and Kaeleigh never talk to one another, the accident Ray caused never made any sense, the fact that Madison hits on both girls\u2019 boyfriends, why Ray would choose one daughter over the other when they\u2019re supposed to be identical. But the ending didn\u2019t settle right with me; it felt too much like a copout.And the fact that, rather than focus on one issue, Hopkins threw in sexual abuse, bondage, teacher-student relationships, parents\u2019 separation, rape, child p*rnography, pr*stitution, drags, and alcohol abuse. I don\u2019t know if she was trying (too hard} to be \u201cedge\u201d and push the envelop with her novel or if she couldn\u2019t decide which problem to focus on in this novel, but her jam packed novel didn\u2019t settle right with me."}, {"userName": "Danni", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5068592-danni", "userReview": "I can certainly say that this is one of my favorite books now. In the beginning, I couldn't help but to think what the ending would be like. It never really gives you a sure-fire conflict. I mean, yes, one twin is molested by her father. The other is getting into a lot of trouble with drugs and boys. But while reading it, the whole time I thought maybe their problems would resolve themselves. Once I got to the ending everything made sense to me and I couldn't help but to stare at my wall for a few minutes with my mouth wide open. It was THAT surprising of an ending. I really had no idea that it would be THAT huge. I think I need to re-read it. Just to give myself more of an understanding now that I know what happened. I never want to re-read a book straight after finishing it. I also have to say, I've never read something in this style or with such plot. I wish I could give this book 1000/10 stars. I honestly do. Read this book. The poetry isn't too difficult to read. It's written prose-y and you can certainly read it like a real book once you get by it's format."}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/377085-debbie", "userReview": "Kaeleigh and Raeanne are identical twins, mirror images of each other. They share a terrible secret. Kaeleigh is the good girl--she does well in school and has a lead role in the school musical. Ian, her sort-of boyfriend, loves her deeply. Her father loves her too, but not the way a father should.Raeanne knows about her father's visits to Kaeleigh's bed. While a part of her wants to protect Kaeleigh, another part of her feels jealous because her father didn't pick her. She breaks rules at every turn, skipping school, getting high, and having all kinds of sex. The family was normal until the night of the accident, when their father, a judge, caused a fatal accident while driving drunk. Their mother responded by throwing herself into her political career and freezing out her family. Their parents are still married, but the marriage is in name only. Their father, lonely and tortured by his own terrible secret, drinks to escape his demons. And he sexually abuses Kaeleigh. I loved the format of the novel. The poems were beautifully written and the shapes, especially of the mirrored ones, made me slow down and savor the structure.The treatment of Raeanne's drug use made me a bit uncomfortable, mostly because the negative aspects were downplayed. In Crank, which details a girl's downward spiral into addiction, her drug use is also graphic and descriptive, but the reader could clearly see the path of destruction. I would have liked to have read more about Kaeleigh's relationship with her father and also about the events in his childhood that set him on the path of the abuser. Also, the twist at the end would have felt more authentic if it hadn't happened so close to the end of the book. I wanted to know more about what happened AFTER Kaeleigh faced the truth. While this was not my favorite Hopkins novel, teen fans will not be able to put it down. It is chock full of issues and mature content. It's all here--sexual abuse, drug and alcohol abuse, eating disorders, cutting, mental illness, bad boys, and, like Pandora's box, a small taste of hope and love."}, {"userName": "Karin", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/72729-karin", "userReview": "One family - damaged by tragedy.

It deals with twin sisters, one who is sexually abused by their father for years and the other who watches it from her bed.It's a story dealing with sexual abuse, mental illness, drug abuse, alcoholism, eating disorders and promiscuity in teenagers, and at times it was really horrifying and difficult to read. But, Ellen Hopkins is really excellent at pulling you through the tough spots with some kind of glimmer of hope that things might turn out alright in the end.At first I hated the sheer number of names Hopkins dumps on the reader right at the beginning--the book is separated into chunks (basically, chapters, but Hopkins doesn't really ever use chapters in her novels) told from the perspective of each twin, with a neat mirror effect with the poetry every time the perspective swaps. There's a lot of names, though, and at first I had a tough time keeping it all straight. By the end it was definitely worth it.I was bugged by some of the details, like the fact the sisters never really interact with each other even though they see each other. Luckily, this is resolved in the end in a way I was expecting about halfway through but was still surprised to see her pull off.It definitely kept me reading, despite some of the rougher points. On sheer craft, plot and character I'd probably have rated this 5-stars, but I certainly can't claim to have loved this. \"Liked it\" is the closest I can get--I'm glad I read it, but it's really hard for me to really say how much I enjoyed it."}, {"userName": "Kristi", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1310688-kristi", "userReview": "Okay so, WOW. I was first introduced to the power of verse writing when I read I Heart You, You Haunt Me by Lisa Schroeder. I love the rawness, no fluffy descriptions or unneeded stances, just pure emotion. Laci is a huge fan of Ellen Hopkins and she had been trying to get me to read one of her books for a long time. And it isn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t want to, I was just waiting for the right opportunity. And when opportunity comes knockin, you best answer the door.I read a lot of books. And ones that make a definite impression are few and far between. But I\u2019m not always in the mood to read a book that makes an \u201cimpression\u201d sometimes I just want a book that entertains me, makes me feel good. Identical falls in the former category with a few other books that continue to stay on my mind.This book is engrossing, it\u2019s disturbing, it\u2019s disgusting, it\u2019s addictive, it\u2019s powerful and I loved it. I did have sneaking suspicion throughout the entire book and when it was finally revealed I still didn\u2019t believe it. But, the less you know about that going in, the better.

I'm used to her books being about drugs or sexual things, but this book was different. At the beginning you're introduced to these two twin sisters, Kaeleigh and Raeanne. You learn that their father sexually abuses Kaeleigh and Raeanne secretly wants it.Then you LATER learn, Kaeleigh's mother never forgave their father for the car accident he caused in which Raeanna died & the mother was injured. The mother, Kay, then ran for Congress woman and was never home, which made the fater, Ray, in charge of everything. The daughters both had their major problems: drugs, sex, alcohol, etc. and they both had a hard time loving someone else after what their father did to them.The sad part is, at the end of the book, or near the end of the book I should say, you learn that Raeanna actually died in the car accident caused by Ray and Kaeleigh had multiple identities, living through herself and her twin sister.It was a really confusing book and makes me wonder where Ellen Hopkins gets her ideas, you know?

The writing is great though, and the story too actually. Awesome really. I thought I knew what I was reading, and then she flipped it. Quite brilliantly. I should have thought of it. I loved that I didn't. It's so lovely to be oblivious. No, really. I usually expect plot twists, and I mostly find it tiring if there are none. Just not with this genre. Probably because it's just light, bland, nothingness most of the time. At least IMO more often than not, it's time wasted. And then this book comes along. Really, why is it that I automatically disregard contemporary fiction? I know... Because it doesn't interest me much. Because they're all the same.. Identical is more, though. It's teenage drama and family life, sure, but not just. And not just small ridiculous stuff, or a bunch of generic morals being pushed through either. This novel offers more than mere ordinary or relatable issues. It probably won't make you feel, like you've experienced something similar, or know someone who has. It might not even make you feel all that emotional - except maybe more or less appalled - regardless of the devastating subject. Or, I wouldn't think so. At least I didn't love it for its ability to draw me in emotionally. I loved it as a whole, especially because it allows for a lot more grayscale than most. Which I think, is what makes it stand out. That, and the fact that nothing gets sugarcoated, or gloss over. Also it's the definitely proof, that there's still lots of great stories, I've missed. In fact, I might just have to go back to screening the contemporary genre a bit more thoroughly. Maybe even read the actual description rather than just skim a few lines. And acknowledge, that the genre is not all chick-lit, teenage romance and the likes. At least not if I'm more careful with my choices. I've actually been wanting to read something by Ellen Hopkins for awhile. I can't recall why though, because if had I known what to expect, I wouldn't have left it for sometime in the future. Obvious I'm happy with this book. It's one of a small number of books I've actually liked enough to go for the five star rating this year. *Sad face* As for Ellen Hopkins. I'm definitely reading more of her books. Soon. Fortunately there is a lot of them. In fact I went straight on to RUMBLE. Which I enjoyed less - Probably inevitable, because how would it compare to this one? And it's kind of impossible not to compare, when reading them back to back.

There are some novels out there that touch on controversial topics bluntly and frantically. It's like you have a pipette full of corrosive chemical X, and Ellen knows just how much to put and how often, too. It never gets boring, and it never drags on. I felt that her other novel 'Crank' was a bit tedious, but this was not at all. I loved how the twins lead such different lives and wanted different things out of it. The thing about writing from two perspectives, I find, is that they sometimes merge because of how alike they are. This happens a lot, and I have trouble keeping track of the characters and events. But each character, I have to say, from the twins to their parents, was so developed and gritty, it was like they were real people, because even the beautiful people had ugly, maiming flaws. Both the plot and the writing is so goddamn gripping. The prose is so lyrical and poetic, but extremely disturbing. And at some points I stopped reading, because it was like, what the fucking hell am I reading? But I read it because despite all of that, it had me hooked. And the plot, it was like so damn mysterious until the end. Nothing is resolved until the last page, and it kinda just makes you want to keep reading, even when it's over.The end was just...

Then of course, we never get a truly happy ending. If you are familiar with Hopkins' other works like Burned, Impulse, etc then this should not come as a surprise to readers.Identical deals with child molestation, pedophilia, domestic abuse and the complete destruction of a family. Kaeleigh and Raeanne are twins with totally different personalities, Kaeleigh is very passive and slightly timid. As the marriage between her parents deteriorates, her father- a district court judge with his own past- takes out his sexual frustrations on his daughter. Raeanne, who has witnessed this since she was ten, is actually jealous that their father favors one above the other. In response to this Raeanne is sexually promiscuous and keeps herself high. With the already disturbing content laid out on the back over I knew to expect something out of an episode of Law and Order: SVU, but still, reading Raeanne's recollection of the sexual acts their father had Kaeleigh perform on him since the age of six made me cringe. There was one particularly moment when it is implied that Raeanne wanted to please her father as a child by doing these things and as a teen, still does in the back of her mind. Despite it all, as usually, I love Hopkins' ability to keep me at the edge of my seat.

However, that is not the case with this book. \"Identical\" is the first book I have read by Ellen Hopkins, and I'm very unsure what to think, or if I want to read any of her other books.I have never particularly enjoyed verse writing, so when this book arrived and I saw that it was ALL in verse, I considered just leaving it in a corner to collect dust. BUT! Yes, there's a \"but\". After reading a couple reviews on here, I decided to give it a shot. I can say that I'm glad I did.Now I know since you're reading this, you have probably heard all about the book from the summary and all the other reviews. So I won't talk about that at all. There are a couple things I would like to say though.1) People who say this book is too disturbing: Don't listen. I'm a young reader, and I PROMISE you it did not corrupt me in any way. If not the best book in the world, the story is one that teaches us a lot about ourselves. Though I myself don't do drugs or go around sleeping with every guy I meet (let out that breath you've been holding), I find that the emotions are very easy to relate to.2) *SPOILER HERE (kinda)*: I wish that Kaeleigh had told Ian about her father, or at least that he had found out some other way.3) *REAL SPOILER*: I was SO shocked when I found out that Raeanne was dead. At the end, Kaeleigh feels more in control. However, I just felt hopeless from the perspective of a reader. Sure, Kaeleigh learns to stand up for herself. But come on. She lost her sister, her twin sister, her strongest link. The fact that I'm frustrated probably means that Ellen Hopkins did her job though.So should you read this book? Sure. Give it a go. If you're like me and can't abandon a book, you'll be fine. It's a quickie. But don't expect something amazing. And the \"disgusting\" parts... embrace them for their part in the story. It's life, and there is no use hiding from it. I commend Hopkins for being brave enough to express this issue as it is. If people have a problem with it, then they can read a whole lot of other books out there."}, {"userName": "Kathryn", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6504379-kathryn", "userReview": "[she wishes she could love Daddy better than Kaeleigh, and basically she would give him sex whenever he wanted and however he wanted (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Bonnie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5136858-bonnie", "userReview": "Interested in more of my reviews?

Identical is the story of Kaeleigh and Raeanne, 16 year-old identical twins. Their father is a district court judge and their mother is currently running for Congress. On the outside their family is picture perfect\u2026 but look closely and you\u2019ll see the cracks in their veneer. Kaeleigh has been sexually abused by her father since she was nine years old.

Brutal story but so incredibly well done it was shocking."}, {"userName": "Jay G", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30890847-jay-g", "userReview": "Want to see more bookish things from me? Check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfer...Kaleigh and Raeanne are identical twins, each with their own dark secret. Their mother is running in the upcoming election and their Daddy is a district-court judge. Kaeleigh is the focus of her Daddy's affection and Raenne craves the love she never received. Raeanne quickly turns to drugs, sex and alcohol to try and fill the void her parents created. With each sister spiralling out of control, they need to save each other, before it's too late. Wow... This book blew me away. This book is so twisted and dark, it had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I had my theory on how the book would end, I ended up being correct, but honestly I thought it was so far fetched and didn't think that it would actually happen, but I'm so glad Hopkins decided to end it the way she did! I love the alternating perspectives between the two twins.

What the hell is this? It's a 565 pages of poems? This is gonna be weird and confusing. HOW WRONG WAS I!!!!!!!I started flipping through the pages as fast as I could cause I must and needed to know how it ends. After page 3 I barely noticed it was in poem form and in the middle of the book I realized this author is a genius. Not only for how unique this book is but her writing style is highly addicting. **claps loudly for author**This book is messed up. Like you will be traumatized. And somehow I could not stop reading. Many times I cringed and said OMG NO as I quickly kept turning the pages! And the ending! OM-EFFING-G Brillant!!!!"}, {"userName": "Aryn", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6415628-aryn", "userReview": "Actual Rating: 1 and a half starsI was kind and rounded up.I finished this book last night and I'm still not entirely certain what I want to say about it or how I want to rate it. I wanted to sleep on it, mull it over - I'm still at a loss. So, I'm just going to start writing and hope that whatever spills out gives me an appropriate star rating.What the back of the book says: \"Kaeleigh and Raeanne are identical down to the dimple. As daughters of a district-court judge father and a politician mother, they are an all-American family - on the surface. But behind the facade, each sister has her own dark secret.\"First of all, during the entire book, I couldn't remember the girls' names, so I was calling them Twin 1 and Twin 2. I'm probably just going to continue that into the review, because that'll let me have more of a stream of consciousness, try to get this all out. Twin 1 is being raped by Daddy, and Twin 2 wants to be raped by Daddy. I almost had to stop reading on page 25. \n\"...And if Daddy would just standstill for me, I'd happily tap his core.\"\n\nI threw the book against the wall at that point and walked away. I was pissed, and honestly, I still am. That was a clue that perhaps this book was written for the shock value, and not entirely for tackling the issue. I know it's a hard issue to tackle, but I've read books with similar subject matters and none of them have left me with a book on the other side of the room and twitching. Shock value is not synonymous with tackling difficult issues. One of the reviews I read on Goodreads, that I can't find at the moment - if you find it, let me know and I'll link to it - called this book \"trauma porn.\" At this point I am inclined to agree.Thank Gods after that point the I want to fuck Daddy, erotic language was largely dropped, because that's what made it seem like Hopkins was just trying to get a rise out of us. There were definitely other scenes that I felt were written for their shock, rather than their value, but nothing that got such a disgusted reaction from me.Twin 1 is the \"weak\" twin, who can't say no, is the lead in the school play (Grease). Twin 2 is the \"strong\" twin, getting stoned daily, sleeping around with her dealers. Both twins have eating disorders of various types, and deal with their pain in less-than-healthy ways. Mom is always away, she's running for Congress, only returning for photo-ops. Daddy's a judge and he's also an alcoholic, control freak.It was almost a 600 page book, and I had the big twist figured out in the first 150 or so. I think if I hadn't figured it out, I would have stopped reading. It made some of the shock value stuff seem less out-and-out shock value. I'd explain why, but if you still plan to read this, or are reading it and haven't figured out the big twist, I won't give it away for you.I think that Ellen Hopkins is an incredibly talented author, I actually enjoyed the prose - and I am not a poetry person, not even a little. What soured this book for me is that I didn't think she was actually tackling the big issue, I think she was writing to get a rise. And she got one, but not in a good way.I think that I'd be interested to read Crank, because that was based on her daughter, so it will probably be less shock-value and more actual value."}, {"userName": "NotoriousGOT", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4366666-notoriousgot", "userReview": "2.5 stars for this one, but will round up to 3. While I found Ellen's writing hypnotic and it sucked me in, in a big way, I felt like this just seemed too....taboo. (Not going to lie. I figured out the plot twist by just reading the synopsis. )I get that Ellen wants to tackle the very real problems of child molestation, pedophilia, drug abuse, mental illness....but it felt just very visceral and too much trying to shock you with horrific scenes. I am no prude, but seriously, I can do without a scene about a father performing oral sex on his 10 year old daughter. I got it. I got uncomfortable the first time she describes one of her fatherly encounters. I also got it on the second or third. What I wanted, what I hoped for, was for Ellen to address the protag's mental state AFTER she had finally decided to address her problems. I was so hoping for a story that would not only open your eyes to the horror of acts like child molestation, but then show readers (especially young readers who might personally identify with the story) that you can rise above something like that. That you can, as a teenager, heal your wounds.Instead, the ending is rushed and bleak. But it felt bleak as if Ellen had decided that since all of her other books have bleak endings, this one should have one too. I'm not asking for a happy ending, I just think that the more interesting story is watching someone go through something horrible like that and then figure out how to get to the other side.Either way, I think Ellen Hopkins is an incredibly important writer and one every reader needs to explore. Does she have better books, probably. Would I recommend this to a first time Ellen Hopkins reader? Probably not. This was my first venture into her work and I feel like it just wasn't her best (based on the reviews and word of mouth thoughts on some of her other work.) Overall though, I am happy I finally read one of her books and this one is one I'm surely not to forget....ever."}, {"userName": "MarnieSkinner", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2137304-marnieskinner", "userReview": "Reading the book Identical was a very different experience for me, in an imaginative sort of way. It was very disturbing to hear all of the problems each \"girl\" were going through; with their father, their mother, grandparents, Ian, and schooling. Everything happening in their lives was so dramatic, nothing seemed to be good for either of them. It hurt me to have to hear all their complaints, espeically when it came to Kaeleigh. Every turn of the page was very suspenceful, knowing and waiting for some new twisted situation to occur. Over all the book was very overwelming. It made me think of awful things, it also gave me the feeling of sadness; I actually felt connected to the girls throughout the entire book. Many emotions raced in and out of my mind as I read. Towards the end of the book is where everything started getting jumbled together. It came so fast without any clues, it was sort of like the auther just threw it in there, just as a way to end the book quicker, which I did not like at all. The end of the book was very confusing and suprising, it all happened so sudden I didn't have time to process what was happening.When reading Identical I actually learned quite a bit. It showed me that people can be very diceiving, even those who are close to you and at times you might not be able to trust them. It taught me that insest and things of that nature happen more often then expected or hoped. I look at a lot of things differently; my home life and my social life. I appreciate what I have, opposed to what it could be."}, {"userName": "Janie Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5116650-janie-johnson", "userReview": "I was looking for a quick fluid read to end this month with and I am so glad I picked up this one. Wow, another great work of art by Ellen Hopkins. Whenever I read her stuff I am forced to feel! I experience a huge variety of emotions, from hatred to disgust to love and sadness. I can't help myself really, her words draw me to tears every time I read her works. She writes with such raw emotion, you can't help but feel everything she feels, everything her characters feel.From the start you are let inside of Kayleigh's and Raeanne's heads and their messed up lives. I could never even imagine living a life such as this. I felt as though I jumped right into the book and lived these lives with them, powerless to help them or heal them. No one to really talk to or ask for help. They had to handle all the craziness in their lives themselves. Their parents are a prime example of what is wrong with this world today.I like Hopkins style of writing too and that is due to being a poet myself. Her words flow with so much meaning. The reading is so fluid. So much so that it makes it hard to put the book down. I would recommend this book or actually all her books to anyone. Even though she writes in verse her novels speak volumes and everyone should at least try her out and see what they can discover and feel as well."}, {"userName": "shukri", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38586507-shukri", "userReview": "4/5 starsI don't know how I didn't see that ending wow not predictable at all.

Its about two girls, identical twins, who have very different personalities. Its told from both of their perspectives and written entirely in poems. They lead a hard life after a life altering car accident. Their mother, now cold and heartless is a politician, and is rarely home. Their father is a drunk and addicted to oxycodon.  Kaeleigh is unsure of herself, and unable to love because she is being molested by her. Ian, her best friend and only good stable thing in her life is completely in love with her. She loves old people and gets attached to a woman who shares her own tragedies. Kaeleigh releases her hardships by cutting, and eating.  Raeanne is a hard ass, promiscuous, drug seeking rebel who loves her father very much and resents her mother. She is seen as the stronger twin, because Kaeleigh isn't strong enough to say no to people. She spends her time with Mick and Ty, who supply her with free weed, as long as she supplies them with herself.  I would recommend this to anyone who needs a good, hard core story. There's a twist in the end that will make your heart drop. Ellen Hopkins is the New York Times best seller author of Crank, Impulse, Burned, and Glass. The lives in Nevada with her husband and son.

But I can honestly say, I didn't guess a lot of it.I felt so bad for everything in this book.
