While telling, or perhaps one should say, revealing, a simple but affecting plot, Peki\u0107 gives the reader much to ponder, about ownership and those who oppose it, and the heartbreaking way history keeps repeating itself. And all is couched in a witty and engaging way. What an achievement!A warning: the attractive NY Books edition I read has an introduction by the painter Barry Schwabsky, which absolutely must be avoided until the book itself is read, and possibly even then. In the course of telling the story in such detail that all turns and surprises the author carefully fashioned are ruined, Mr. Schwabsky makes many assertions that were alien to my experience of the book, and I was grateful not to have heard them before having lived through it on my own. My rule is: be careful reading about a book in advance, even what's written on the covers, and never, ever, read an introduction to fiction. Among the many enticing perceptions Peki\u0107 gives his readers, I especially liked a character's architectural analysis of Le Corbusier's church at Ronchamp, and the protagonist's love of the buildings he possesses and which support him not merely as a commodity to buy and sell for a profit or as the source of his income but for their individual beauty, and the uselessness of a will or any legal documents in a world without laws and a way to enforce them. Centuries of war and cruel domination by a succession of ideological or just opportunistic conquerors gives a cynical yet melancholy tinge to everything. \"The former Yugoslavia,\" where Borislav Peki\u0107 was born, was the former something else before Yugoslavia and yet something else before that. The backdrop of this heartbreaking history is in the end what the novel is about."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/281393-jim", "userReview": "Ars\u00e9nie Negovan, property-owner, is seventy-seven years old. It is the 3rd of June 1968 and he has not stepped outside his front door since the 27th of March 1941. For the past twenty-seven years he has run his business empire with the aid of his wife, Katarina, and the family lawyer, Mr Golovan, while he sits at his window peering at his women through a selection of binoculars: Simonida, Theodora, Emilia, Christina, Juliana, Sophia, Eug\u00e9nie, Natalia, Barbara, Anastasia, Angelina . . . and those he could not see though his lenses he could picture in his mind\u2019s eye. To each one he had been devoted and had been for many, many years. His wife knows all about them. How could she not? He has photos of them on the wall of his study. And scale models even! Freud said it was sex; Jung, belonging; Viktor Frankl, meaning and Adler, power. In one of his essays, however, Peki\u0107 singled out \u201cthe will to possess\u201d as one of the most powerful driving forces in our world, a phenomenon which inevitably influences even the \u201cspiritual and moral side of man.\u201dThe \u2018women\u2019 are, of course, houses, the things Ars\u00e9nie Negovan prizes over everything else. Says Ars\u00e9nie: \u201cHouses are like people: you can\u2019t foresee what they\u2019ll offer until you\u2019ve tried them out, got into their souls and under their skins.\u201dThe book really focuses on the two dates above, the last two times he steps outside and yet by comparing these two times the author presents a curious and unique perspective on the history of Belgrade.

I love their books and own over 150 of them.Pekic was born in what was then Yugoslavia, and this book was first published in 1970. It's a relatively short novel and a fairly unusual one at that. For one thing there is virtually no discernible plot, and really only one important character, the narrator himself (and of course, his houses).The book is called Houses because his houses are all that matters to him. They are all named, and all with female names (all 49 of them). He actually treats them and cares for them as if they were women. When they fall into disrepair, he says they are ill. His wife, who is really a secondary character compared to the houses, is jealous of them, as he spends way more time dealing with them than he does with her.I can't really say too much else, without ruining it for any prospective readers, so I will just say that I really enjoyed it, and if you like literature in translation, or just feel like reading something different, I would highly recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Ratko Radeta", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7574979-ratko-radeta", "userReview": "\u041c\u043e\u0458 \u043d\u0430\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043d, \u0433\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435 \u041f\u0435\u043a\u0438\u045b\u0443. \u041c\u043e\u0458 \u0434\u0443\u0431\u043e\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043d."}, {"userName": "Ana Daji\u0107", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14293305-ana-daji", "userReview": "\u201eNa\u0161i gradovi su ti du\u0161u dali za gra\u0111anske ratove, kao da su pravljeni da se na ulicama koljemo: poslovni centar sa trgovinama i nadle\u0161tvima, pa za\u0161titni pojas gra\u0111anskih domova, a onda radni\u010dki kvartovi, ali i oni su opkoljeni gradskim letnjikovcima, iza kojih opet vrebaju seljaci.

The book parallels the Belgrade student riots of 1968 with the unrest caused by the Hitler/Yugo pact of 1941 and the Bolshevik uprising in 1919. It's framed as a confession/will by an insane bourgeois house owner. Pekic's language is mesmerizing, and the book grips you as he traces the slow deterioration of the narrator's sanity."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5642737-david", "userReview": "Peki\u0107 provides a fascinating, modern version of the interplay among reality, illusion, and delusion equal in form and delivery if not scope to Don Quixote. The story of Arsenie Negovan, property owner, is a tragedy of a life deeply conflicted between attachments to houses and the idea of advancing civilization through architecture and a petty selfishness Negovan attempts to overcome but never quite succeeds. The latter, combined with his own insecurities, ultimately led Negovan to withdraw from any sort of public life following a brief, violent encounter with a mob of anti-collaborationist, communist, and socialists shortly before the German invasion of Yugoslavia. Arsenie withdraws to his flat, contemplating his various properties through binoculars and detailed records, even as they are expropriated by the post-war socialist government of Tito or demolished during his self-imposed exile. The book examines his last day where Arsenie is confronted with reality, and the narrative beautifully captures the destruction of his carefully imposed order. While flawed and sometimes arrogant, there is something unspeakably tragic about the 77-year old man writing out his last narrative, will, and testament on the backs of rent books and account ledgers of the houses he loved like children.Arsenie is only one member of the vast Negovan dynasty Peki\u0107 spent a modest portion of his fictional life chronicling. The vast, complicated family experienced as many rises and falls as the disparate Slavic peoples that made the, relatively, short-lived Yugoslav state. Their history is briefly touched on in Houses, but it is unfortunate Peki\u0107's The Golden Fleece detailing the history of the Negovans is not available in English translation."}, {"userName": "Bojan", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12070101-bojan", "userReview": "It can be hard for English reader to catch up with all (ideological, political, esthetic...) layers of this wonderful novel. Even though narration is quite simple - given through the perspective of only one narrator, the clash between the reality (well known to local readers) and the delusion of the main character is what brings the beauty of the tragedy and what makes this book complex and worthy of reading again. Smart humor is given here through a parody of the headline of Erich Fromm's book \"To Be or to Have\". A man, a capitalist, a ruthless house-owner, not knowing that communist revolution has happened more than 20 years ago, and that he is \"freed\" of his ownership, still believes that \"to be is to have\" and \"to have is to be\". His eloquence and his don-quijotesque, delusional relationship towards reality makes him likable even though his deeds present him as a real anti-hero. This is what only great writers can do. Pardon my English."}, {"userName": "Moira Downey", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7785152-moira-downey", "userReview": "Bit of a miss for me, though I generally enjoy unreliable and often nasty narrators.

The second half of his life, after World War II and the Nazi occupation, he has spent in one of those houses, being looked after by his wife and a nurse, in hiding. Now, on the last day of his life, Negoyan has decided to go out at last to see what he has wrought.Negoyan is one of the great characters in modern fiction, a charming monster of selfishness and self-delusion.
