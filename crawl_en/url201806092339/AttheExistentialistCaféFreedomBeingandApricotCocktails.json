Author Bakewell brings all the pieces of the existentialist puzzle together here. This is more of what she did so well for Montaigne in How to Live: A Life of Montaigne in One Question and Twenty Attempts at an Answer, which I admired. Bakewell's deft touch makes the turgidities of philosophy dissipate like so much fog over oncoming terrain. The book is so tremendously rich, so filled with great stuff that one wants to memorize it, so just a few highlights here.1. We're introduced to Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir and their crowning achievements at the start in writing that is engaging and at times amusing. Then we learn of the others who contributed to the development of phenomenology and its offspring, existentialism, in ways large and small. These include S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, Franz Clemens Brentano, Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Karl Jaspers, Emmanuel Levinas, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Simone Weil and Jan Pato\u010dka.2. It was Husserl's conception of phenomenology that first excited Sartre. \"The word phenomenon has a special meaning to phenomenologists: it denotes any ordinary thing or object as it presents itself to my experience, rather than as it may or may not be in reality.\" (p. 40) 3. The section detailing the removal of the Husserl's unpublished manuscripts from a Germany on the precipice of war is pure cloak and dagger. The papers were kept in a big house by Husserl's widow, \"officially classed as Jewish despite her Protestant faith,\" whose civil rights were by this time almost nonexistent. Adding to the urgency was the fact that the papers (40,000+ pages!) were written in an minuscule shorthand that to the untrained eye would probably look like secret code. Fortunately, a small coterie comprised of clergy, Husserl's colleagues and prot\u00e9g\u00e9es and several nuns eventually got the papers to Louvain, Belgium\u2014by way of Berlin!\u2014where they remain today.4. When Albert Camus arrives upon the scene in 1942, we learn of the \"important philosophical differences\" that divide his work from Sartre's.As Sartre argued in his 1943 review of The Stranger, basic phenomenological principles show that experience comes to us already charged with significance. A piano sonata is a melancholy evocation of longing. If I watch a soccer match, I see it as a soccer match, not as a meaningless scene in which a number of people run around taking turns applying their lower limbs to a spherical object. If the latter is what I'm seeing, then I'm not watching some more essential, truer version of soccer; I am failing to watch it properly as soccer at all.Sartre knew very well that we can lose sight of the sense of things. If I am sufficiently upset at how my team is doing, or undergoing a crisis in my grasp of the world in general, I might stare hopelessly at the players as though they were indeed a group of random people running around. Many such moments occur in Nausea, when Roquentin finds himself flummoxed by a door knob or a beer glass. But for Sartre, unlike for Camus, such collapses reveal a pathological state: they are failures of intentionality, not glimpses into a greater truth. (p. 151)5. The philosophy of Heidegger, one of Husserl's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, is compared and contrasted with actions in his life, like joining the Nazi party. This is Bakewell's method with all her philosophers, but with Heidegger the approach is especially gripping. Did any of Bakewell's subjects' words diverge more from their actions than Heidegger's? Jaspers spent the immediate postwar years writing The Question of German Guilt. In it:Jaspers inner voice calls to mind Heidegger's [early] authentic voice of Dasein, [which] calls from within and demands answerability. But Heidegger was now refusing answerability and keeping his own voice to himself. He had told Marcuse he did not want to be one of those who jabber out excuses, while carrying on as though nothing had changed. Jasper similarly felt that facile or hypocritical excuses were no good. But he would not accept Heidegger silence either. (p. 192)6. Postwar France was an uneasy place. Much of it centered around personal allegiance to the Soviet Union, while the Gaullist's party, Sartre felt, \"had become almost fascist in style.\" The justification for the USSR in those days was that, yes, while Stalin may appear to be running a police state\u2014complete with show trials; prison camps; no human, much less civil rights; state-sanctioned terror, etc. (See Robert Conquest's The Great Terror)\u2014these methods were mere bagatelles, crude, temporary stop gaps in support of the coming socialist paradise. It was a means-justifies-the-ends argument. One might ask how the Existentialists, for whom freedom was a key philosophical pillar, reconciled matters. It's a very good question. When the Korean war broke out our philosophers and many of their countrymen expected Russia to occupy Paris, much as Germany had done, all as a prelude to the global holocaust of World War III. North Korea's invasion of the South so shocked Merleau-Ponty that he \"...thought it showed the Communist world to be just as greedy as the capitalist world and just as inclined to use ideology as a veil.\" He ultimately turned away from Communism. Never one for the Soviet Union's roughshod methods of expediency, especially if they cost lives, Albert Camus published The Rebel, a theory of political activism that was very different from the Communist-approved one. The book appeared at a time when Sartre was turning more resolutely toward Communism. It proved the end of their already strained friendship.\u2014\u2014 This is just the sort of writing that I prize. Bakewell has been cognizant of existentialism ever since picking up Sartre's Nausea at age sixteen. One feels she's lived the material here. At The Existentialist Caf\u00e9 is foremost a tracing out of existentialism's lineage in a biographical format, but it is also a valuable grounding in its literature. The span of human lives\u2014the philosophers' lives\u2014is the armature on which the principles of phenomenology and existentialism are arrayed and thus given meaning. In that structural sense the book reminds me of Walter Kaufmann's fine Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist, though Caf\u00e9 is the better written book. Highly recommended.PS: This was a surprise to me, though perhaps it shouldn't have been, Jean-Paul Sartre apparently loathed the novels of Marcel Proust. No doubt the latter's tales of fin de si\u00e8cle society cut too close to the bone for someone who'd grown up bourgeois and was now dedicating his life to helping the workers of the world unite."}, {"userName": "Pouting Always", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-pouting-always", "userReview": "I don't know that I can really summarize this book and what it's about because I think the title is pretty self explanatory. It follows the existentialist movement and focuses a lot on Sartre and Beauvoir but also spends a significant amount of time on other major thinkers. I personally hate reading influential works because I don't have the patience. I really applaud anyone who can sit and digest and interpret things like that but I'm not really cultured or smart enough to do it. So this book is perfect for me and I loved it. I really love Simone de Beauvoir and I might actually try to sit and read  The Second Sex because it sounds excellent. I also thought that a lot of Camus' novels sounded really interesting. However Sartre seems like he'd be harder to read especially his later works when he stopped editing. I honestly did think that the existentialists were just emotional cry babies in black turtle necks but now I have a much more nuanced understanding of the philosophy of existentialism and I really am glad. I think the idea of one having to take responsibility for their own life is really powerful and one that really resonates with me. I dont really agree with any of Martin Heidegger, and he seems like a massive dick. Despite all that I ddid learn I however hope I can personally retain the right to be an emotional cry baby in a black turtle neck regardless of whether the existentialists are."}, {"userName": "Trish", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish", "userReview": "There are times in every person\u2019s life when one desires to know the essence of things. It often happens when we are young, and if it does, it may hang around in the back of our minds all our lives, breaking through into real questioning and investigation at different stages, when we need to know how to understand events, either personal or public. Sarah Bakewell makes the argument that the ideas of the European phenomenologist and existentialist philosophers of the twentieth century have so pervaded our world view that we have incorporated their philosophies into our art, literature, rebellion, and social movements, often without knowing exactly where those ideas have come from.Bakewell makes the point that we need to revisit the genesis and development of those philosophies again, not because they were necessarily right, but because they make us think. At a time when people are questioning the notion of \u201cfreedom\u201d to act, of whether we have any agency in the direction of the world or whether we are cast about by forces against which we can only react, Bakewell believes that revisiting the record of the lives, friendships, and scholarship of the existentialists will show us the ways in which they were both acting and reacting to the world around them. \u201c\u2026freedom may prove to be the great puzzle for the early twenty-first century\u2026Science books and magazines bombard us with the news that we are out of control: that we amount to a mass of irrational but statistically predictable responses, veiled by the mere illusion of a conscious, governing mind...Reading such accounts, one gets the impression that we actually take pleasure in this idea of ourselves as out-of-control mechanical dupes of our own biology and environment. We claim to find it disturbing, but we might actually be taking a kind of reassurance from it\u2014for such an idea lets us off the hook. They save us from the existential anxiety that comes with considering ourselves free agents who are responsible for what we do. Sartre would call that bad faith. Moreover, recent research suggests that those who have been encouraged to think they are unfree are inclined to behave less ethically, again suggesting that we take it as an alibi.\u201dBakewell looks at an impressive list of writers and philosophers, some of whom are Sartre, Beauvoir, Merleau-Ponty, Camus, Husserl, and Heidegger. Bakewell calls them \u201chopelessly flawed.\u201d Heidegger removed himself from public life after his support of the Nazi regime made him reexamine phenomenology. Sartre in later years recanted his support of violence, and his support of the Soviet state. Beauvoir in her autobiography writes in wonder, \u201cI might not have met Sartre; anything at all might have happened.\u201dBut Bakewell makes another look at the existentialists and phenomenologists relevant and interesting. We need to think about these things, she suggests, because it has been a long time since anyone has come up with ideas which attempt to define and shape our presence and interactions in the world. Her extraordinary lucidity in explaining the nub of the phenomenology and existentialism, and her vast research into the lives of the philosophers who brought these ideas into consciousness allow her to describe, even illustrate, \u201ccharacter\u201d and \u201cgoodness,\u201d two traits towards which we strive. Bakewell makes us think again about our responsibility in the world, and where the use of technology fits in with our lives as authentic, ethical beings. \u201cComputers are bad phenomenologists.\u201dThis is no dusty, boring tome filled with outdated ideas. Bakewell packs the book with details of the lives and conversations of some of the most charismatic and influential thinkers of the twentieth century. This is philosophy lived, not just talked about. If you have not taken your brain out for a run lately, this fascinating discussion of philosophical principles and principals is a terrific trail in the woods."}, {"userName": "Paul Bryant", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant", "userReview": "Sarah Bakewell was and pretty much still is besotted with philosophy, she loves the stuff, if it was up to her it would be added to the water supply like fluoride so that all may benefit, even itty bitty babies. Her particular enthusiasms are for phenomenology and existentialism. Yeah, jawbreakers. Even so, I bet she has lots of friends, because she is very good company. She bowls this story of 20th century intellectuals along at a fast clip and there\u2019s no time to dawdle or get fed up of Husserl or Heidegger. What there is time for as we rush along is remarks along the lines of \u201cWhat? That doesn\u2019t make the least bit of sense!\u201d and \u201cHuh? Was Sartre out of his mind?\u201dPHENOMENOLOGY, BETTER GET USED TO ITWhat Sartre and his pals did was they got fed up with Kant and the type of philosophy which grinds away at the big one which goes I THINK I KNOW SOMETHING, BUT HOW CAN I KNOW THAT I KNOW WHAT I KNOW? When they came across phenomenology they thought well, now we can put that question into the TOO DIFFICULT box and jump off in a completely new direction. I get that. I would prolly have done the same. Sarah thinks she is able to serve up poptastic breezy descriptions of the essence of phenomenology. But she can\u2019t. A phenomenologist\u2019s job is to describe. It meant stripping away distractions, habits, cliches of thought, presumptions and received ideas in order to return our attention to what he called \u201cthings themselves\u201d. We must fix our beady gaze on them and capture them exactly as they appear, rather than as we think they are supposed to be.The example she gives is a description of a cup of coffee. The first thing to throw out is any scientific information about it, also any information you may have about the coffee trade, how it arrives in your house, where it comes from, all these facts, out they go. Also out go any \u201cabstract suppositions\u201d and any \u201cintrusive emotional associations\u201d \u2013 out they go. Now \u2013 describe the experience of you and the coffee.Apparently Husserl and other phenoms filled giant books with their phenom descriptions of things themselves. Sarah fails to establish what the reason for all this was. Why did they do it? What was the result? I don\u2019t know. But she says \u201cThe result is a great liberation\u201d. It just sounded to me as if the point was to describe precisely your subjective experience of this or that. If so, novelists and autobiographers have been attempting this since Don Quixote perceived windmills subjectively. Sarah describes Nicholson Baker\u2019s novel The Mezzanine as \u201ca rivetting phenomenological account of one man\u2019s lunch break\u201d . I thought, aha, I knew it! HEIDEGGER STATES THE OBVIOUS IN A WAY THAT EVEN PHILOSOPHERS CAN GRASPSartre was only five feet tall and had a wall-eye but Sarah says that women swooned. They never swooned for Heidegger even though he was also quite short and had better eyes. But he was grumpy and Sartre never stopped talking. Heidegger was Sartre\u2019s next obsession. The unfortunate thing was that he was a German who became a Nazi during the 30s, he attended book burnings, and booted Jews out of the university where he worked. When his notebooks from the time were discovered it was found he wasn\u2019t a career Nazi, he was a conviction Nazi. Oops.Heidegger believed in vigilance \u2013 he was determined to shock people out of their forgetfulness. But for him, vigilance did not mean calling attention to Nazi violence, to the intrusion of state surveillance, or to the physical threats to his fellow humans. It meant being decisive and resolute in carrying through the demands history was making upon German, with its distinctive Being and destiny. It meant getting in step with the chosen hero. (He got the tache too!) The philosophers have had a bad time with him ever since, trying to rehabilitate him (he never apologised, he thought it would be trite and insincere \u2013 what is an apology anyway? Those philosophers, hey.)Heidegger invented his own terminology and wrote vast books. Sarah saysRereading him today, half of me says \u201cWhat nonsense!\u201d while the other half is re-enchanted\u2026. Even the keenest Heideggerians must secretly feel that, at times, he talks through his hat.WHAT SARTRE TURNED GERMAN PHENOMENOLOGY INTOa philosophy of expectation, tiredness, apprehensiveness, excitement, a walk up a hill, the passion for a desired lover, the revulsion from an unwanted one, Parisian gardens, the cold autumn sea at Le Havre, the feeling of sitting on overstuffed upholstery, the way a woman\u2019s breasts pool as she lies on her back, the thrill of a boxing match, a jazz song, a glimpse of two strangers meeting under a street lamp, vertigo, voyeurism, shame, sadism, revolution, music and sex. WHAT IS FREEDOM?You might think you\u2019re constrained to act in particular ways by circumstance of birth, of race, of sexual orientation, of contract to appear at a certain place and time, or by moral laws, and this that and t\u2019other thing, but Sartre says phooey, that\u2019s just your situation :perhaps you are facing execution, or sitting in a Gestapo prison, or about to fall of a cliff \u2013 you are still free to decide what to make of it in mind and deed. Starting from where you are now, you choose.So, when the nails are being hammered in, instead of writhing in pain, sing \u201cAlways Look on the Bright Side of Life\u201d; and when the preacher turns to you and says \u201cDo you take this man to be your lawful wedded husband?\u201d you say \u201cWell, I do understand this is a particular circumstance, but I still have the existential freedom to make a choice here. So, you know, maybe. Give me a minute.\u201dIt sounds like applesauce to me.IF YOU CLAIM THAT YOUR \u201cCIRCUMSTANCE\u201d HAS GOT YOU BY THE THROAT & YOU HAVE NO WIGGLE ROOM AT ALLThen Sartre will tell you that you are failing to meet the demands of human life and choosing a fake existence, cut off from your own \u201cauthenticity\u201d.Note : Sartre never had kids, neither did Simone de Beauvoir.

(puts the phone down) Well he's out distributing pamphlets to the masses but he'll be in at six. ONE OPPONENT OF EXISTENTIALISM DESCRIBED IT AS a sickening mixture of philosophic pretentiousness, equivocal dreams, physiological technicalities, morbid tastes and hesitant eroticismA copy of Sartre\u2019s magnum opus Being and Nothingness was sent to Heidegger. The American Hubert Dreyfuss saw in on his desk and asked what he thought. The great man snapped \u201cHow can I even begin to read this dreck?\u201dHOWEVERby feeding feminism, gay rights, the breaking down of class barriers, and the anti-racist and anti-colonial struggles, it helped to change the basis of our existence in fundamental waysA DIFFICULT CENTURY TO BE BORN INSarah Bakewell tells how the philosophers fared as history dragged them through the horrible 1930s and the world on fire that was the 1940s and the crushing weight of Communism that was the 1950s. If Heidegger was a Nazi, Sartre was a Communist, or became one in the 30s \u2013 the perfect example of the intellectual who defended Stalin, defended the gulags, said that Russians did not want to travel because they were too engaged with building the workers\u2019 paradise, then later supported Mao Zedong and even had nice things to say about the Khmer Rouge. Camus was a big pal of Jean-Paul and Simone until he figured that Stalin was a monster; then they fell out. HOW WE LIVED IN THE LATE 1940sLack of good nutrition made them weak and accident-prone. Sartre once somersaulted over his handlebars, and Beauvoir collided with another bike, falling hard on her face, and sustaining a swollen eye and a lost tooth. Weeks later, back in Paris, she squeezed a boil on her chin and felt a hard while nubbin emerge. It was her tooth, which had buried itself in the flesh of her jaw.THE SECOND SEXWhile the males where philosophising abstractly Simone de Beauvoir wrote The Second Sex in 1949 and kick-started the second wave of feminism. Dig this : French women only got the vote in 1944. French married women could not open a bank account in their own name until 1965. The Second Sex became vastly the most influential existential work ever. EVEN THOUGHEnglish-language paperback editions of the book through the 1960s and 1970s tended to feature misty-focused naked women on the cover, making it look like a work of soft porn. Her novels got similar treatment. Strangely this never happened with Sartre\u2019s books. No edition of Being and Nothingness ever featured a muscle-man on the cover wearing only a waiter\u2019s apron.THE LATER SARTREIn 1958 John Huston in a fit of madness hired Sartre to write the screenplay for a biopic of Freud he wanted to do. They didn\u2019t hit it off. Sometimes, after leaving the room, Huston would hear Sartre still raving on, apparently having failed to notice his listener\u2019s departure. Sartre was just as puzzled by his host\u2019s behaviour : \u201csuddenly in mid-discussion he\u2019ll disappear\u201d. Sartre turned in a huge screenplay which would have lasted 7 hours if it was filmed. Huston explained that it needed to be cut down to two hours. Sartre revised his work and came back with a screenplay which would have taken 8 hours to film. Huston fired him.So many anecdotes, so little being and time."}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2016", "userURL":

original beforehand. All existentialists and phenomenologists, with the rich addition of de Beauvoir's feminism, and most all influential across the humanities and the social theory side of the social sciences. Husserl, in particular, was vogue in sociology and influenced both theory and research method. Such great gossip with the heady conversations, too! Reflecting on this again, I'm taken with how nonchalant these great thinkers were a century ago towards the rising ethno-nationalist fascism in Europe, not taking the rise of Hitler seriously. It's hard not to make the obvious connections to Trump, as well as to the global rise of ethnic nationalist populism and what is may bring.The best thing about this book is that a handful of philosophy profs I know (including the one I currently share a home) who aspired to write \"historical fiction\" with real-life philosophical and social biographical knowledge, have had highly enthused but also tortured reactions to this. As a group, some longing and with some jealousy, perhaps, that THEY didn't author such a creative interplay of personalities and ideas! It really is a masterpiece. I predict other philosophers and social thinkers will be portrayed in future works in similar \"human\" settings with informal and \"real life\" interaction. There are probably some instructional implications that we are just beginning to fathom for teaching from this type of model, too, I'm thinking as an \"old\" EDU prof...UPDATE: at a brunch party of 8 progressives (mostly academics) last Sunday, the first in December '16, a retired English prof friend brought this book out from his lap as we sat to dine, and for our real sustenance read a paragraph from it from Jan Patocka on the result of social-political upheaval as the \"solidarity of the shaken\".

Er erschafft sich erst durch sein Handeln.\"\"Die Grundbedingung des Menschseins ist die Bewusstwerdung seiner selbst bis zum Moment des Todes, der dieses Bewusstsein ausl\u00f6scht.\"Nietzsche und Kierkegaard waren die Vorboten des Existenzialismus. Sie definierten die menschliche Existenz als Vollzug von Entscheidungen und stellten die Angst und die Herausforderungen des Lebens in den Mittelpunkt. Philosophie war f\u00fcr sie nicht nur ein Beruf, sie war das Leben selbst - das Leben eines Individuums.\"Wir k\u00f6nnen zwar nicht w\u00e4hlen, was uns zust\u00f6\u00dft, wohl aber, was wir geistig daraus machen.\"In diesem Caf\u00e9 nahmen nicht nur Sartre, Beauvoir und Camus Platz.

As of old age, it was someone who asked the clever questions, then took the questions apart, shook the pile of new questions up and defined answers to each one.The principle of thesis, antithesis, synthesis is not that easy to fathom in the first place, but in the hands of the Existentialists it gets even harder. Sarah Bakewell takes the reader gently by the hand and walks him/her through the basics of Existentialism, where it came from, how it worked, its background in Phenomenology and the early sources of inspiration.We also get a good knowledge of the people circling around Sartre and Beauvoir, how they were influenced or repelled by the many changes that were significant of the Existentialist period. I am judging a solid 4 stars for the performance and the massive effort it has taken to sum up all sources, clear up all the built-in contradictions and end up with a consistent book and even making it edible by throwing in anecdotes of the cast to soften up this otherwise rather dry topic.Thumbs up for the full annotations as well.Going back to my opening question, I can only answer it if I was able to go back to my adolescent years, before I acquainted myself with first the classical and then the 18th and 19th philosophers. At first the questioning is directed at the being itself. What does it mean. Not being satisfied with the simple answer; I\u00b4m born, I grow, I live, I\u00b4ll die, the early and mid-20th century philosophers took the speculations to extremes. I may offend some, but there is a certain amount of overthinking involved in the philosophical thinking of this era. The theories about identity, what forms it, how significant is it and does it change with social impact are everyday knowledge today.Today we talk about reference frameworks, knowing well that we behave differently within different frameworks. You fill in one role in your family, another one on your job, a third one on your soccer team and so on. This does not make you a \u201cfalse being\u201d it only demonstrates that the human is a many facetted being, adaptable to many social frameworks. The personal freedom which brought out such anguish, can be said to be what drives the ability to make yourself passable within all the frameworks of which you are part. It is no coincidence that Existentialism was born and thrived in the years between WWI and the 60ties.Having experienced to be unfree in mind and body there was a call to explanation of the sudden freedom after WWI. Today we would talk about coping strategies in a broader sense, but that term was not yet available and hardly established as a set of \u2013 relatively \u2013 predicable patterns. So, we are presented to a group of people who sit down and think. \u201cWe have been through Hell. Some have come out alive but at a terrible cost. Many did not survive and our trust in our fellow human beings are destroyed. How will we regain our self-esteem, how do we look at the future. How do we see ourselves in this\u201d. To keep it simple, we have the reactive and the proactive.Those who walk back to the beginning of all things, the days when the mind was open to any impression and you just had to learn to feel the world around you. A tree is not only a tree, it is the leaves, the flowers, the smell of a fireplace, the house you could build from it. The thought of expressing everything \u201ctechnically\u201d is repulsive and it barres the conscious mind and restrains it. Interesting as Phenomenology is as a way of perception, it does not resolve everyday tasks, but in this time of history is a way back into oblivion and tends to romanticize rather than look for solutions to life\u00b4s big question.The Existentialism is much more extrovert. Essentially man only exist when absorbing the world around him, thus mirroring himself in the world. This mean you should take part, play an active role in your life in order to exist. I am sure you will agree that, without any interaction with an outside world a person will to the outsider seem shallow and almost nonexistent.Having this established, the terms of interaction can be discussed. Being by definition free, your choices are infinite. You may choose anything that makes you happy and bear the consequences. That said, one of Sartre\u00b4s favorite examples; the waiter balancing a tray with bottles and glasses expertly, is not freedom. The waiter is \u201cin bad faith\u201d as he only \u201cpretends\u201d to be a waiter to earn a living. I once was a waiter, and quite good at it, I could easily balance a tray of bottles and glasses. At the same time, I was the son of my parents, I was a boyfriend, I was a student and filled in a lot of other roles Maybe that is one of my pet peeves when it comes to Sartre. Advocating the total freedom, but not accepting it when he saw it with others. With exception of his lifelong relationship with Simone de Beauvoir, Sartre fell out with so many friends that took their freedom of mind seriously. Lesson to be learned; Do as I say, not as I do. To value the core message of Existentialism, you must be unfree. This is why it hit nearly 4 decades so hard and attracted a lot of followers. When ultimate freedom is available there is no longing \u2013 instead you may experience the Kirkegaard anguish, faced with the responsibilities of so much freedom. This could easily turn into something very long and boring \u2026 I hereby set you free to read on \u2013 at your own risk and responsibility."}, {"userName": "Chrissie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie", "userReview": "Does existentialism confuse you? It did me. Every time it was used a different idea was expressed. This is because the \"existentialist philosophers\" had divergent views and because their respective views changed with time. To be clear, when one speaks of existentialism one should state according to whom and when! The term itself began to be used in the 1940s. The existentialist thinkers date from the 19th and 20th centuries. Most were European. Fyodor Dostoyevsky, S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche are cited as some of the earliest, but the book does not focus on them. It begins instead with the German philosopher Edmund Husserl (1859-1938) and phenomenology. We follow closely the lives and thoughts of Husserl, whom I had never heard of and found to be one of the most interesting, along with Martin Heidegger (1889 \u2013 1976) , Karl Jaspers (1883 \u2013 1969), Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1908 - 1961) and of course Jean-Paul Sartre (1905 \u2013 1980) and Simone de Beauvoir (1908 \u2013 1986). The radical ethical thinkers Gabriel Marcel (1889 \u2013 1973), Emmanuel Levinas (1906 \u2013 1995) and Simone Weil (1919 \u2013 1943) as well as others such as Albert Camus (1913-1960) and Iris Murdoch (1919 \u2013 1999), although not covered as thoroughly, are discussed in relation to how they influenced the central theorists. The book moves forward chronologically showing how each of these thinkers influenced each other and how history, politics, place of birth and religion shaped them. Both the similarities and differences in the philosophers\u2019 thinking are drawn. The book follows the thinkers to their respective demise. That existentialism blossomed during and after the war years is no coincidence. Heidegger\u2019s Nazi ties are discussed without bias. Not only are the books and essays of the central figures thoroughly discussed, but also the political and cultural milieu citing the films, clothing, trends and lifestyle of the era. The author has since her youth been drawn by philosophy. She explains her own thoughts about each respective philosopher as well as those of others. She guides, clarifies, questions and opines. One feels as though you too are sitting at that table in the caf\u00e9 with these theorists discussing ideas, throwing out questions and contemplating what being and living and experiencing life is all about. This book offers a fascinating discussion of ideas, to which there are of course no definitive answers. Yet the book goes further. It looks at the thinkers\u2019 lives because \u201cideas are interesting but people (and their relationships) are vastly more so\u201d. This is a quote from the book, but I have added that inside the parentheses because this book is about how the thinkers influenced each other. None stood alone. The author makes each of these individuals come alive. She makes what they were thinking about relevant still today. The audiobook is superbly, fantastically, magnificently read by Antonia Beamish. She makes what could have been a difficult to book to follow simple. She reads so you understand. She emphasizes and pauses enhancing the written text. You hear the questions, laugh at the humor and her pronunciation of French and German words are perfect. She manages to produce a reading that is clear and beautiful. I am going to have to classify her as one of my favorite narrators. Books on philosophy can be so esoteric.

Martin Heidegger, Edmund Husserl, Karl Jaspers, Maurice Merleau-Ponty and others by Sarah Bakewell is an absolutely delightful examination of existentialism and the people who created it and lived it. It is a wonderful introduction for a lay reader, such as myself. As in her other work, How to Live: A Life of Montaigne in One Question and Twenty Attempts at An Answer, the book is bursting with life and an appreciation of the thought and lives of others.The Existentialist Cafe contains biographies of the various players in the existentialist drama and how their lives and personalities connected with their thinking. Although I had a slight familiarity with some of the figures, I was amazed at Blakewell's portrayal of their lives, personalities, and philosophy. She made me want to read Sartre and even Heidegger (I think I'll refrain) by bringing them to life as amazing and forceful characters.And as a whole the book left me feeling appreciative of life itself, of being alive and all the richness of experience that involves.

Tough book to review.

It's a basic introduction to Existentialism and does not claim to be anything more, but it also holds various insightful speculations as a challenge to its readers, while presenting enough goofy interactions to entertain us while it does so.Overall I felt it was a great book.

This is appropriate given the shift in Bakewell\u2019s thinking: \u201cWhen I first read Sartre and Heidegger, I didn\u2019t think the details of a philosopher\u2019s personality or biography were important. \u2026 Thirty years later, I have come to the opposite conclusion. Ideas are interesting, but people are vastly more so.\u201dSome of the interesting characters herein, apart from Sartre and de Beauvoir (always referred to in these pages as \u201cBeauvoir,\u201d which irked me unduly), are Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Karl Jaspers, Hannah Arendt, Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Albert Camus. It\u2019s a large cast; you may well find yourself flipping back and forth to the helpful who\u2019s who list in the back of the book. I was amused to see that Freiburg, Germany is the seat of phenomenology (which gave rise to existentialism) \u2013 I\u2019m heading there in June to stay with friends at the start of a mini European tour. Husserl was the chair of philosophy at Freiburg, and Heidegger his colleague.The best I can make out, Heidegger\u2019s philosophy was about describing experience to get to the heart of things. Disregard peripherals and focus on the self\u2019s knowledge of the world, he advised. His best known work, Being and Time, contrasted individual beings with Being itself (i.e. ontology). Think of him as an experimental, modernist novelist, Bakewell advises; understanding what he\u2019s doing with his philosophy is difficult otherwise. Existentialism built on this framework but emphasized freedom and how it is exercised in particular situations.World War II, especially the year 1945, was a turning point for many of the philosophers discussed. Sartre was held in a POW camp but his eye troubles gave him a way out. Many left Europe for America due to anti-Semitism, including Hannah Arendt and Bruno Bettelheim. Although Heidegger contrasted \u201cthe they\u201d (das Man \u2013 more similar, perhaps, to the English phrase \u201cthe Man\u201d) with the voice of conscience in such a way that suggested one should resist totalitarianism, he would later be exposed as a Nazi. In the following years, the United States became very popular culturally: jazz music, film noir, Hemingway. At the same time, the French were shocked at America\u2019s racial inequality. Sartre believed that one should always take the opinion of the \u201cleast favored\u201d or most oppressed party in any situation, which would lead him to speak out for minorities and the colonized, as in the Algerian liberation movement of the 1950s\u201360s. In the meantime, the rise of the Soviet Union and the development of the atom bomb would emerge as imminent societal threats.Sartre and de Beauvoir had an open relationship but clearly relied on and felt deeply about each other, especially when it came to their writing. Bakewell convinced me of Sartre\u2019s surprising sex appeal, despite his unprepossessing appearance: \u201cdown-turned grouper lips, a dented complexion, prominent ears, and eyes that pointed in different directions.\u201d Apparently he had a silly side and would even do Donald Duck impressions. At the same time, he had rock-solid convictions, as evidenced by his refusal of the L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur and the Nobel Prize. I also learned that he was a biographer of Jean Genet and Gustave Flaubert; his biography of the latter, in three volumes, stretched to 2800 pages! Bakewell waxes anti-lyrical in her account of the disheartening experience of reading it: \u201cOccasional lightning flashes strike the primordial soup, although they never quite spark it into life, and there is no way to find them except by dredging through the bog for as long as you can stand it.\u201dFrom the title and subtitle, I expected this book to be a bit more of a jolly narrative than it was. The frequent Left Bank Paris setting is atmospheric, but the tone is never as blithe as promised. I would also have liked some additional autobiographical material from Bakewell, who grew up in Reading, England (where I currently live) and met the existentialists through Sartre\u2019s Nausea at age 16.In the end the fault may not be her book\u2019s but mine: I wasn\u2019t up for fully engaging with a multi-subject biography packed with history and hard-to-grasp philosophical ideas. I\u2019d recommend this to readers who long for bohemian Paris and have enjoyed either an existentialist work or a philosophical novel like Sophie\u2019s World (Jostein Gaarder) or 36 Arguments for the Existence of God (Rebecca Goldstein).With thanks to Chatto & Windus for the review copy.Originally published with images at my blog, Bookish Beck.Further reading: If anything, I think I\u2019m likely to try de Beauvoir\u2019s autobiographical works \u2013 the descriptive language Bakewell quotes from them sounds appealing, and of course she was fundamental in paving the way for modern feminism.You can read an excerpt about de Beauvoir\u2019s composition of The Second Sex, at Flavorwire.

For some reason that word and subject makes me shudder. Okay, it's not \"some reason.\" It's the fact that I have a stereotype in my mind of those who practice philosophy often times seem to delight in not practicing philosophy but actually practice some dark art of obfuscation and intellectual one-upsmanship that adds absolutely nothing to the conversation or subject. I'm being kind of mean but that's how I feel sometimes, much of it could be chalked up to my own ignorance. It can be hard since I have no background in this subject, and I'm not well-versed enough to be able to decipher who are honest deep thinkers adding valuable contributions and theories (that I just can't understand) to those who are merely intellectual obfuscators using philosophy as a selfish tool to deliberately try to show people how smart they are (well, how smart they think they are!). Sometimes it's a mix, people fall along a wide spectrum, even great thinkers can be intellectual snobs who fall into pushing empty ideas dressed up by a bouquet of verbal garbage. I guess you could say I do somewhat subscribe to the following quote, although I don't think it is universally applicable but I do think it is appropriate for most cases in life, and it can apply to philosophy: \"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.\" - Albert EinsteinAnyways, all that to say that the author, Sarah Bakewell, is absolutely fabulous. She explains things simply. I loved her writing, I loved her thinking, I loved her explanations. She makes philosophy, at least existentialism, incredibly accessible. That is a huge selling point. The other thing I love with this book is how she delves into the biographies of all these philosophers (starting with a variety of German phenomenologists to the French existentialists) as a means of illuminating their ideas and thinking. So I said I've never been into philosophy, not in an academic sense. Which is totally true. But like a lot of disaffected suburban kids, I discovered and was mesmerized by the French existentialists when I was in HS. I romanticized them and lionized them, although I only knew and read and understood their ideas in the most superficial manner. Camus was always my favorite mostly because he seemed so cool, haha! But as I've gotten older I've gotten a deeper appreciation of those writers/philosophers who focused on the absurdity of life, specifically Camus. It's something that rings true to me, not necessarily in its universality but because it mirrors some of my own personal life experiences. Bakewell gives treatment to a wide range of philosophers, some notable ones that stick in my mind are Husserl, Heidegger, Camus, Sartre, Beauvoir, Merleau-Ponty, Levinas. There were many others as well. What struck me was how well she described them, their ideas, their lives. None were perfect, each had personal flaws and errors in judgment, grievous deviations and errors in ideas (which to be fair is bound to happen when you are working on countless ideas!). Sartre was a fascinating character to me, and via Bakewell's analysis as much as he made certain errors in philosophy or politics I came to see him as she did, a man who operated in \"good faith.\" I really want to further explore the schism that took place between Camus and Sartre regarding politics. Politically/morally I skew more towards Camus, but I don't know all the nuances of their argument. I'd like to read Camus' The Rebel for a deeper insight into his thinking. An interesting aspect to all these thinkers is that many were friends, deeply connected. It's amazing how many of these relationships disintegrated due to politics. It's sad, and terribly relevant imo. For example, Beauvoir (whom I deeply respect) and Sartre basically excommunicated certain friends (whom they had had loving relationships with for years upon years) because of a difference in politics. On the one hand I get it, these are people who trafficked in thinking, in ideas, and politics encompasses all these moral, intellectual values, the deep fundamentals of one's personal matrix. And yet it speaks to today, this is killing us as a society, the lack of ability to connect with those who hold different political values. Personally I do not think friendships should end because of politics, unless it is under the most radical circumstances. I guess I was somewhat disgusted by Sartre and Beauvoir's attitude on this count, because as thinkers I would think they would want to engage in relationships with people who would push their thinking, challenge their thinking, and that they would appreciate intellectual adversaries who were able to show them where their arguments might lack logic or manifest weakness. Because that is how I TRY to approach these conversations with people who think completely differently from me. If we can engage in honest good faith dialogue, and if you are able to successfully show me where my logic, my argument lacks fundamentals, where the weak spots are, then you are doing me a favor! you are helping me see. You are forcing me to think more deeply, dig into a deeper more nuanced analysis where I have to craft a rebuttal, or shift and evolve my stances and thinking... Not only does Bakewell beautifully show us these philosophers' thinking, their ideas, and their personal biographies, she also expertly presents the backdrops of their societies, the political, historical, and economic forces that played a role in shaping them. This is hugely important, we are all products of our time, and this is never more true than for these German and French philosophers who came of age in a time of insane nationalism, war, nihilism, despair, political upheavals within their societies, racism, colonialism, bigotry, etc. To see how they acted within this backdrop, how they manifested (and evolved) their morals/personal philosophy within this context helped me see who they really were, what they stood for, what ideals they were willing to live up to (or not live up to). This book brought up some great moral and philosophical questions that are relevant in all of our lives. The cool thing was much of the existential philosophy was not just abstract mumbo jumbo, but it had direct implications and questions for how we as individuals choose to live our lives. Questions of freedom and personal choice/free will and individual moral accountability. Sure there are weak points within the philosophy of existentialism and yet there are many relevant questions and thinking grounded within reality that can help push us in analyzing and thinking about our own lives and how we live them. So near the end of the book when it got into questions of personal freedom, ability of the individual to act within larger historical forces, I couldn't help but think of Westworld. We all operate within \"loops,\" life habits that are comforting, that keep us anchored and free from too much freedom. I think it was Sartre who said that true freedom is frightening, and I do agree. Many of our actions are based in habit, it is difficult and tiring to practice true freedom in thinking and actions. Plus there are the larger forces holding us back from practicing true freedom including society, culture, our hardware/biology, life necessities... But sometimes we have to rise to the challenge, and live life with greater consciousness in an attempt to pierce through our habits that keep us from exercising greater personal agency. It cannot always be done, but it is important to try and recognize our trappings so that we can better decide when it is necessary to break through our habits and exercise greater personal imperative. (Tbh I do not think a 100% deep true freedom is possible as I think such freedom would break our minds haha! habits are actually good for us, they anchor us, but the key is picking and choosing when to break the habits, that is the freedom we have imo)Last note. I did think that existentialism seems to have certain similarities with Buddhism. Specifically the idea of practicing greater awareness and consciousness in every moment, both philosophies seem to be focused on the power of the individual and freedom.Ack, ok last last note of something that totally fascinated me. Bakewell brought up a study that said that for those who believe that there is little freedom, personal choice, those that believe we are destined by our society/culture/historical forces to make certain decisions, guided and controlled by fate if you will... well these people are more likely to act more cruelly. The hypothesis is that they feel less personal accountability for their actions, their belief in a lack of freedom is an alibi for them, it allows them to distance themselves from personal accountability and blame their actions on destiny/larger forces. For those who believe we have greater freedom, greater choice in life, well they act less cruelly, since they see greater personal accountability within their own actions. I just thought that was so interesting. I need to see if I can find this study this is based on. I mostly listen to audiobooks so unfortunately I can't dog-ear these sections that strike me, I wish I could cite that study and look further into it, check out the methodology and fundamentals of the study... google here I come!Long story short. I love love loved this book.

And her book sparkles with life and wit too \u2013 who would have thought that a book on the thought and lives of these existentialist philosophers would make compelling reading? But it does.It will be one of my standout books for the decade, I think.Near the end of the book, Bakewell points out why these \u2018fundamentally flawed\u2019 writers should be re-read. \u2018They remind us that human existence us difficult, and that people often behave appallingly, yet they also show how great our possibilities are\u2019. Their questions about freedom and being are as fundamental to us now as they were in the 1940s and 50s.She writes that \u2018existentialist ideas and attitudes have embedded themselves so deeply into modern culture that we hardy think of them as existentialist at all\u2019: questions of freedom, purpose, human identity, living human relationships, ethics for religious and non-religious, relationships between individuals and between sexes, the self and the Other, are just some of the territory she illuminates so skilfully. The existentialist messages of individualism and challenges to conformity offered people reasons to reject convention themselves and to change their lives. They inspired their own and later generations, including mine. It took me a while to realise just how much the intellectual climate of the 1960s and 70s, even in Australia, was fuelled by the ideas coming from these French philosophers. They affected not only our thinking, but our attitudes and actions. In the absence of easy acceptance of tradition, and an ethical basis that depends on religious belief, it was and is a challenge to live a meaningful and ethical life when the social and political environment is constantly in flux.Sartre\u2019s existentialism implies that it is possible to be authentic and free, as long as you keep up the effort. Man must constantly invent his own path. To do that he must be free, responsible, without excuse \u2013 then there is hope. (p10) Such a radical freedom plunges the individual into a state of anxiety, angst or \u2018angoisse\u2019, - not a fear of anything in particular but a pervasive fear about oneself and one\u2019s existence (p154). By denying this fundamental freedom, one is in a state of \u2018bad faith\u2019. \u2018There is nothing exceptional about this: most of us are in bad faith most of the time, because that way life is liveable\u2019. (156). For me to be in good faith, I must not make excuses for myself, no matter what my situation (though Sartre did take this to extremes).He wrote this at a time that Europe was in ruins after World War II challenging his readers to use their freedom to decide what sort of world they wanted and make it happen. Both Sartre and de Beauvoir put their philosophy into the stuff of real life in political activity, saw it as \u2018a discipline for flourishing and living a fully human, responsible life\u2019 Sartre and de Beauvoir\u2019s open relationship was a philosophical choice. \u2018They wanted to live their theory of freedom. The bourgeois model of marriage had no appeal for them, with its strict gender roles, its hushed-up infidelities, and its dedication to the accumulation of property and children. They had no children, they owned little, and they never even lived together, although they put their relationship before all others and met almost every day to work side by side\u2019. (p15)De Beauvoir\u2019s pioneering feminist work, the Second Sex, was perhaps the most transforming of all, says Bakewell. She conveyed a sense of \u2018the subtle balance between freedom and constraint in a person\u2019s life. She showed how choices, influences and habits can accumulate over a lifetime to create a structure that becomes hard to break out of\u2019 and placed this in the wider context of our existence as gendered, historical beings. (215-216).Bakewell reminds us that ideas emerge from people, and she has given us not just the ideas of the philosophers, but the rich texture of their lives and the tumultuous world of their lifetimes."}, {"userName": "Bill Kupersmith", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12460952-bill-kupersmith", "userReview": "At the Existentialist Cafe was an almost ideal nonfiction travel audio book, a marvellous example of what the French call haute vulgarisation, which means not upper-class swearing, but writing about complicated technical subjects in a style that even someone as thick as myself can follow. This book is a great introduction to the thought of Martin Heidegger, @ least for me, whose previous knowledge of Heidegger was a picture of an old fellow in funny clothes sitting on a bench in a forest. Finally too I think I understand where Husserl fits into the history of philosophy & why he is important. Like Sarah Bakewell, I discovered Existentialism while still @ school, but unlike her I also learned early on that I had no philosophic mind. What appealed to me about Existentialism was the fantasy of hanging about on the rive gauche with girls in black tights whilst wearing a black roll neck jersey. My BF @ school was an even bigger fan than I; when Albert Camus was killed in a car smash (not just a car smash, a Facel-Vega smash!), he wore a black necktie in mourning. Still, by the time of the evenements of '68, it felt like JPS had passed his sell-by date. So for me this book was less a history of a philosophic movement than a chance to revisit the world of my teenage self. But it also gave me @ least some idea of what my grad-student friends were talking about then. One had DASEIN on his licence plates. A young woman friend recommended de Beauvoir's The Second Sex, tho' given my tendency to fall in love with women whom I knew to be smarter than I, it wasn't exactly eye opening. Sarah Bakewell seems to consider that book the most important product of the entire Existentialist programme, & given its huge presence in the feminist movement, she may well be right. But it still feels to me very much an autobiographic memoir by a woman who had been an upper-middle-class jeune fille in the early 20th century, not all that applicable to American women even in the '60s. But who am I, a male, to comment? Having no capacity for strenuous thought, I feel equally out of my depth commenting on the other Existentialists, but Levinas, Jaspers & Marcel felt like the most worthwhile & morally & spiritually rewarding. I can also see why Merleau-Ponty's ideas would be attractive to film makers. As for JPS himself, I'm still inclined to think him essentially (yes, I had to use the dreaded 'E-word') a fraud, but one who truly believed his own fabrications. All of his own idols turned out to have clay feet, the Soviet Union, China, l'Indochine, Algerie algerienne. Now that Castro is gone, how soon will Cuba succumb to capitalism like China & Vietnam. It was as if Sartre spent his career in search of the cause du jour, to find where the crowd was going next so he could get in front of it. From April 1940 to August 1944, the period of the German occupation & probably the worst in Europe since the Black Death, Existentialism was perhaps the only thing going for a decent human being & given the total failure of the Roman Catholic Church under Pius XII, atheism was the only viable form of belief, except in the extreme forms of Christianity to which martyrs such as Simone Weil & Edith Stein were willing to go. I'm still inclined to the view that Existentialism belongs more to the history of culture (maybe even as in my case, the history of fashion--Bakewell is great on the jeunesse's passion for American lumberjack shirts) than to the history of philosophy. But as another recent adventure in time travel, The Existentialist Cafe is an absolute delight."}, {"userName": "Jay Green", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39595324-jay-green", "userReview": "It would appear that Sarah Bakewell and I discovered the existentialists at the same age (16-17) and in the same year (78-79), responding to them almost identically too: amazement, awe, and wonder that someone could encapsulate so well an experience we had yet to put a name to ourselves. It may therefore come as no surprise that I love this book, which does a great job of recapturing that experience and explaining why it is that the existentialists continue to have such an influence over our contemporary understanding of the human condition. Of course, for many years the existentialists have been overshadowed by poststructuralist, deconstructionist, and systems theorists, and in some ways their attitudes and opinions are rather dated - or, at best, simply of their time - but by no means all of them. Indeeed, Bakewell does a fine job of situating the existentialists' thought in relation to the various strains of New Left thinking and of suggesting why it is that, when other theories have been rendered obsolete, existentialism has retained its relevance.If I'm honest, the philosopher in me would have liked to have seen a more in-depth account of Sartre's theories, from \"The Imagination\" and \"The Imaginary,\" through \"Being and Nothingness,\" and up to his later search for a Situated Ethics. The sociologist in me would have liked to have seen a more in-depth account of the \"Critique of Dialectical Reason.\" The anarchist in me would have liked to have read more about Sartre's disagreements with Camus on Algeria and anti-imperialism, especially since there's a tendency for people to take one side or the other in the Sartre-Camus debate and usually on fairly flimsy grounds, when in fact the argument between them reaches down to the roots of what it is to be human and to act ethically. E. M. Forster once said, \u201cIf I had to choose between betraying my country and betraying my friend, I hope I should have the guts to betray my country\u201d, an attitude not identical to but at the same time certainly not that far from Camus's \"If I have to choose between terrorism and my mother, I choose my mother.\" The point of such a stance is that a higher ethical code is not necessarily the more abstract one (consider, for example, Carol Gilligan's Ethics of Care); that one can be on the \"wrong side of history\" and defy it while still retaining one's dignity. Interestingly, in his final years, Sartre himself moved beyond Marxism and away from the pursuit of a Kantian, universalist ethical code argued for in \"Existentialism is a Humanism\" and closer to a situated ethics that could understand the universe within each individual; it was like he had finally caught up not just with Camus but also with De Beauvoir, who was years ahead of him in her understanding of ethics. Of course, all of this is too much to expect of an introductory book such as Bakewell's. Suffice to say that what she does do, she does very well, and I am sure that this book will provide a springboard for many readers into the deep pools of existentialist thought. I certainly hope so."}, {"userName": "Carlos", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1701553-carlos", "userReview": "I loved this book, but mostly because I love the subject, existentialism has always been a philosophy that I been drawn to, ever since I was a kid and had ideas that I thought didn't make sense...it wasn't until I found the writings of Camus, Sartre and the definition of existentialism in my early teens that I realized that I wasn't alone in the way I thought . This book analyses the movement, its main players (Sartre, Camus, Simone de Beauvoir and Heidegger), It goes on to analyze some of the personal lives of said player, with a emphasis on Sartre and Beauvoir. There are moments when the book gets too philosophically heavy for people who never had read a philosophy book, and that is exactly why I give this book 4 stars, because its not for the beginner , it is a book directed to people who already have a knowledge of existentialism and its many intricacies.

After reading this book, I say, \u201cIf you are Sarah Bakewell, you can take existentialism and make sense out of it.\u201dThe existentialist themes of freedom, political activism, and \u201cauthentic being\u201d became watchwords of the middle and late 20th century. When I first encountered existentialist writing, I was simultaneously entranced, repelled, and confused. (Bakewell tells us that even Beauvoir said that when she and Sartre tried to read Heidegger\u2019s lecture \u201cWhat is Metaphysics?\u201d, \u201cwe could not understand a word of it.\u201d) Not only did the existentialists not always agree with each other, sometimes they did not even agree with themselves. National Book Critics\u2019 Circle Award winner Bakewell\u2019s clear writing and carefully researched portrayal of the context in which existentialism developed gave me a much better understanding of this school of thought that both influenced and reflected most of the last century. In addition to a providing a lucid discussion of the various expressions of existentialist philosophy, Bakewell really brings to life the thinkers behind it. Names like Husserl, Heidegger, Beauvoir and lesser known figures in their milieu became real people. One of my favorite chapters introduced me to \u201cthe dancing philosopher\u201d Merleau-Ponty, whose personality was as engaging as his thinking. Unlike Beauvoir and Sartre, \u201cjournalists did not quiz him about his sex life---which is a shame, as they would have dug up some interesting stories.\u201d Photos throughout the book were a nice complement to the narrative. My favorite, which is on the last page of the book, shows Sartre and Beauvoir together laughing and obviously enjoying life, a stark contrast to the angst usually associated with the existentialists.The existentialists\u2019 lives spanned almost the entire twentieth century: World War I, the Great Depression, World War II, and the Cold War with its threat of nuclear attack. They were profoundly affected by what was happening around them and to them. Bakewell does an excellent job of showing how, as Merleau-Ponty put it, both their lives and ideas were \u201ccontingent\u2026---at the mercy of historical events and other changes they could not control\u201d. It was heart-wrenching to envision Edmund Husserl fleeing the German persecution of the Jews while his former friend and student served as a leading apologist for the Nazis.In the final chapter, Bakewell lets the reader in on some of her own feelings about existentialism and the existentialist figures, from her original fascination thirty years ago to how her feelings shifted in the course of writing the book. It was an excellent summation that gave me more insight into the author as well as the philosophy and people she writes about.I\u2019m not sure whether to call At the Existentialist Caf\u00e9 biography, history, or philosophy. What I will definitely call it is worth your time. This book could be a contender for another major award.Re-reading for the Sunday Philosophers October 2016."}, {"userName": "Mr.MeHr", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2017", "userURL":

"http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/730754-ken", "userReview": "I was attracted to this book for two reasons. I have always admired existentialism and some of the literary works of Sartre (chiefly his short story, \"The Wall\") and Camus (chiefly his novel, The Stranger). And Sarah Bakewell's last book, How to Live: Or a Life of Montaigne in One Question and Twenty Attempts at an Answer, was one of my dark-horse favorite reads of recent years.This one does not live up to the Montaigne book, alas, but it was passably diverting. You'll learn more than you might wish about a wide range of \"existentialist-style\" thinkers, many you don't know, such as Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Karl Jaspers, Edmund Husserl, etc. Of the ones you DO know, you'll learn more than you need to: Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, Simone de Beauvoir, and Martin Heidegger.Philosophy like this can give me a headache. The philosophers themselves seem to struggle, constantly banging their heads against the realities of the world and politics. Case and point: Sartre's championing of Communism and how hard he fought against backing down in the face of Soviet camps and Soviet aggression against Eastern European independence movements (e.g. Hungary and Czechoslovakia).One thing I like, though, is existentialism's emphasis on freedom and Bakewell's final reminder that it is more relevant than ever in our Age of Technology. Addiction to the Internet, to cellphones, to texts, to social networking sites. The existentialists are rolling in their graves as this unanticipated, figurative fascism takes over with abandon. My sympathies, for sure.Nevertheless, they thought a lot, perhaps too much, and argued like children at times, further proof that, even among the highest intellects, life is middle school and remains so (a rather depressing take-away for a middle-school teacher like me).Am I the better for reading it? Sure. I know more than I did. But will it lead me to further explore the existentialists and their writings? Unlike the case of Montaigne (whose Essays I at least tackled), the answer is no.That said, no regrets. And I still admire Sarah Bakewell, author and thinker."}, {"userName": "David Yoon", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4934590-david-yoon", "userReview": "I\u2019ve never been big on reading philosophy. I\u2019ve not read any Camus or Satre and only know the handful of Neitzche quotes every emo teenager learns. As far as I know, existentialists wear all black with a penchant for turtleneck and smoking Gauloises. Despite that I found the book incredibly interesting. When the current philosophical craze tends to Hyyge or the teachings of Marie Kondo, the idea of Sartre and de Beauvoir sitting in Paris cafes \u201cloudly slaughtering the sacred cows of philosophy, literature and bourgeois behaviour to anyone who venture into their ambit\u201d is compelling. This was a time where women swooned at a sold-out public talk by Sartre at the perfectly named Club Maintenant. Where Franciscan monks orchestrated the smuggling of philosophical papers with a cadre of Benedictine nuns. Ideas held power and thoughtful discourse was weighted with the realities of World War 2. The book isn\u2019t written with the haughty tone of a Philosophy major holding forth on his intellectual heroes but more a clear-eyed examination from an ardent fan. Imminently readable even if, like me, you don\u2019t know your Hegel from your Heidegger."}, {"userName": "Kamil", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23253765-kamil", "userReview": "Fantastic introduction to the existentialist philosophy.

Although it's just an introduction to Existentialism, it gives you more detailed information about the personality of the key characters of Existentialism and as a result, a more clear view of that time.

It's as intelligently entertaining as Bakewell's book on Montaigne, and fills in some background on lesser known characters in the Existentialist movement like Husserl, Heidegger (who becomes more sinister and less credible with every revelation) and Merleau-Ponty. But the stars of the caf\u00e9 are Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir \u2013 and by the end of Bakewell's story it's clear she appreciates them as much for their foibles as for their philosophy.Admittedly it's difficult now to view the strenuous exertions of Sartre & Co. with much respect, at least in my case. Like thousands of other boomer students entranced by Existentialism, I started off with William Barrett's 1958 classic Irrational Man: A Study in Existential Philosophy with its tortured Giacometti skeleton striding across the cover, and diligently worked my way through the classics. Now it's an exhausted passion. So if I say that Bakewell doesn't take her subjects too seriously, that's an attitude I understand.Albert Camus gets short shrift in this volume, as indeed he got from Sartre and Beauvoir. Bakewell merrily skates past this abysmal \u2013 and cruelly revealing \u2013 affair, in which Sartre more or less assassinated the character and credibility of Camus, a story better told in Tony Judt's books The Burden of Responsibility and Past Imperfect and Ronald Aronson's Camus and Sartre: The Story of a Friendship and the Quarrel that Ended It. Bakewell doesn't deny the facts but more or less glosses Sartre's aggrandizing espousal of trendy (\"revolutionary\") violence and Soviet/Maoist state-sanctioned murder as well as his way of dumping any friends who questioned his latest proclamations (the other signal example being Raymond Aron). Bakewell provides a telling anecdote about the pair's fractured friendship with Arthur Koestler.In 1950, Koestler mentioned to Stephen Spender that he'd bumped into Sartre and Beauvoir after a long gap and suggested they have lunch. They responded with an awkward silence, and then Beauvoir said (according to Spender's second-hand version), 'Koestler, you know that we disagree. There no longer seems any point in our meeting.' She crossed her forearms in a big X, and said, 'We are crois\u00e9s comme \u00e7a about everything.'Nor does her account of the manic intensity with which Sartre and Beauvoir approached their writing do much to engender respect. One can easily imagine them today on Twitter, broadcasting their latest absolutely moral, impregnable position hour by hour, condemning with the hauteur of the righteous anyone who disagrees, and backtracking their positions shortly thereafter without a twinge of retrospection. \"As his friend Olivier Todd commented, Sartre's beliefs changed but his extremism never did.\" Bakewell is fully aware of the contradictions and the all-too-human aspects of her heroes but this book has the feel of a benediction.

It's not really a textbook of philosophy, but combines a history of existential philosophy with biographies of the key members of that genre, with a major emphasis on Sartre and Heidegger, with some basic explanations of the major elements of existentialism. So if you are already extremely conversant with philosophy, this book is probably not going to interest you much. But for a complete neophyte like myself it was a good toe in the water kind of book. Although I still haven't decide whether I will venture any farther into this field, as I'm not too terribly interested in it, to tell the truth. I'm still glad I read this book though."}], "description": "Paris, near the turn of 1933. Three young friends meet over apricot cocktails at the Bec-de-Gaz bar on the rue Montparnasse. They are Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and their friend Raymond Aron, who opens their eyes to a radical new way of thinking. Pointing to his drink, he says, 'You can make philosophy out of this cocktail!'From this moment of inspiration, Sartre will create his own extraordinary philosophy of real, experienced life\u2013of love and desire, of freedom and being, of caf\u00e9s and waiters, of friendships and revolutionary fervour. It is a philosophy that will enthral Paris and sweep through the world, leaving its mark on post-war liberation movements, from the student uprisings of 1968 to civil rights pioneers.At the Existentialist Caf\u00e9 tells the story of modern existentialism as one of passionate encounters between people, minds and ideas. From the \u2018king and queen of existentialism'\u2013Sartre and de Beauvoir\u2013to their wider circle of friends and adversaries including Albert Camus, Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Iris Murdoch, this book is an enjoyable and original journey through a captivating intellectual movement. Weaving biography and thought, Sarah Bakewell takes us to the heart of a philosophy about life that also changed lives, and that tackled the biggest questions of all: what we are and how we are to live.", "title": "At the Existentialist Caf\u00e9: Freedom, Being, and Apricot Cocktails", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25658482-at-the-existentialist-caf", "average": 4.21, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1456742264l/25658482.jpg", "reviews": 787, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1191388.Sarah_Bakewell", "name": "Sarah Bakewell"}], "type": ["Philosophy", "Nonfiction", "History", "Biography", "Cultural"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25658482-at-the-existentialist-caf", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25734059-at-the-existentialist-caf", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33945974-at-the-existentialist-caf", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33022164", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31202256-das-caf-der-existenzialisten", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33526419", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30509073-at-the-existentialist-caf", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29285064-at-the-existentialist-caf", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7624457-how-to-live", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2720299-the-english-dane", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21124616-montaigne-philosopher-of-life", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4485350-the-smart", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40110939"]}
