Quite common, occurs more frequently than not. To what do I refer? The next book one reads by that author. To be fair, Andre Sinus III's \"Bluesman\" was published long before \"The House of Sand and Fog\" (this is notably his debut novel), but the result is the same. Try as I might to be reasonable, high expectations that are almost certainly not met.A great book, by all means. \"Bluesman\" follows Leo Suther in his final year before adulthood. It is the summer of 1967, and friends are being drafted for the Vietnam War. Leo lives in a small Massachusetts town in the Connecticut River Valley with Jim, his father.\u00a0He falls in love with local beauty Allie Donovan, son of Chick Donovan, a man who hires him for construction/roofing for the summer and he soon finds out to be a devout Marxist Communist. He is also pursuing his other lifelong love- for the harmonica, spending time with his father (who plays the guitar) and Ryder, a harmonica/harp player that teaches him everything he knows. He begins more intimate conversations with his father, discovering his late mother's inner life through her diaries. He suffers ups and downs in his sometimes confused love for girlfriend Allie and impulsively rushes into a series of dangerous decisions, including a pregnancy and culminating in his enlistment in the Army. Like in his other works, Dubus series with compassion and empathy. The characters are what make the novel. The overall tone of the novel is kept low, however. Nothing greatly emotionally charged like \"The House of Sand and Fog\". The problem is, many things great importance happen to Leo during the summer, but somehow do not really transform him, and the reader is left hanging. He makes his decisions, but they are all forced upon him and he makes them with little thought. One anticipates that the learning and growing will come later, but we area left without the details of this. A sweet coming of age story, well written and especially commendable for its addressing of communism and discrimination (Ryder is black, homosexuality was hinted at), the exploration of the music world and the blues, and the examination of what young men likely felt during the years of the Vietnam War."}, {"userName": "Rob Rogers", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58133181-rob-rogers", "userReview": "You don't have to be a fan of the blues to appreciate this lyrical novel, although you probably will be by the time you finish the book. Set in a small Western Massachusetts mill town during the summer of 1967, the story follows its 17-year-old protagonist as he navigates first love, the national argument over Vietnam, his own development as a musician and a man (not necessarily in that order) and a reckoning with his parents' past. This is a slow read -- Dubus' sentences are powerful, immediate and poetic -- but it's one worth savoring."}, {"userName": "Lacey", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2343704-lacey", "userReview": "It always stuns me that I rarely hear people sing the praises of this book. I usually have to reassure myself that it's just because people haven't heard of this book, but then I'm left wondering why that is, when it is so, so good. The protagonist, Leo, is written with such clarity and precision that you can't help feeling that you are him...or that you're 100% head over heels passionately in love with him. This is no easy task for an author to accomplish.In many ways, this book encapsulates the spirit of the best coming-of-age stories. It's about Leo's growing into a man at a time where nothing about the world seemed clear or predictable. It's about making mistakes and being unsure of what path one wants to take. Leo's experience in the late sixties is peppered with information relevant to the cultural climate of the time, but it does not hinder the story or seem forced. His time working as a construction work for a fervant communist is a particularly interesting element of the story, but his relationship with his father and blues music contributes to a large portion of the book's beauty.It would be odd to call the book \"musical\" necessarily, though music informs its subject matter both directly and indirectly. It would be more apt to suggest that the book has rhythm and harmony, that the mood it provokes is well-suited to the blues music it praises. It's a book suited for a lazy, hot, humid afternoon, for sitting on a porch as the sun goes down, for having a cigarette (because only Leo has ever made it seem almost tempting, for me).This may not be the most academically lauded book of all time. I'd be hard pressed to call it some kind of instant classic. But it's a book I happened upon one day by accident, and felt all the luckier for doing so. It's a great read, and I've made it my personal duty to convince anyone with eyes to read it, and fall in love with Leo the way I did."}, {"userName": "Booknblues", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4280875-booknblues", "userReview": "Leo Sayer the young protagonist in Andre Dubus III's book the Bluesman is a young man coming of age in the time of social upheaval of the Vietnam era. Like many young man of that age his interest is sex, passion and music while trying to discover who he is and who he is going to be. Much to his delight he discovers sex with his girlfriend Allie Donovan. While being tutored by Allie on essential knowledge of the opposite sex, Leo is guided by his three father figures on the meaning of life. Leo's father Jim, introduces him to the world of Blues and acquaints Leo with his diseased mother,through her diaries and poetic writings. Leo's uncle Ryder provides harp lessons and helps Leo to feel the blues. Allies father Chick Donovan gives Leo an opportunity to work for him as a carpenter and teaches him the philosophy of Carl Marx.Throughout all of his lessons Leo exhibits a sensitivity, but remains dazed and confused as to the direction of his life. During this time Leo is faced with some decisions, which others of this era faced as well as some unexpected choices. Dubus, adeptly holds the readers interest and the reader alternately feels frustrated and sympathetic with Leo.Dubus is a skilled writer and his lyrical style reinforces the dreaminess of Leo's character. It encapsulates the essence of a youth who is impatient to get on with life along with the insecurity of how to go about it.Bluesman is recommended reading for those familiar with the Vietnam era and those who would like to know more about it."}, {"userName": "Lukas", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3641933-lukas", "userReview": "I love this novel.

I generally am a fan of character exploration and it's not that Bluesman doesn't have memorable or important characters. They're very believably human, imperfect, sympathetic... They are the heart of this story. I should have enjoyed this. But the bulk of the book felt like it dragged. Maybe it was the monotone of the storytelling. While very vivid, the prose was rambling. It was all just running river, Coca-Cola, Wonder Bread, muted Jim, dramatic Allie, and Leo's constant erections for pages. It's an eventful summer, but you wouldn't really feel it from the way the writing told it. Don't get me wrong, the writing is beautiful and is the reason the characters are so vivid. But it's difficult to feel an emotional connection to characters that read so emotionally removed. They never develop. They are who they are and they stay who they are until the last page. This is particularly glaring when reading Leo. The story is supposed to be his coming of age, but he stays just as naive and immature as he starts off. He sure goes through a lot, but I don't feel that I came away from this story with the satisfaction of seeing Leo come to any realizations or grow as a person. This book was a beautifully painted picture of uninteresting people in rural Vietnam-era Massachusetts, but eventually it gets boring just looking at the same picture for 300 pages, not matter how well drawn it is."}, {"userName": "Rick", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1115800-rick", "userReview": "This early novel is not Andre Dubus III at his best. Check my Goodreads list for some more interesting books. Still this early novel set in Massachusetts during the Vietnam War is a serviceable coming of age novel that is written in a straight forward realistic style.

He reveals a deep truth about reality, which is that despite our modern devotion to the ideals of freedom and personal agency, we are often caught up in forces outside our control which sweep us to unavoidable fates. These forces can be societal, ongoing wars and so forth, but they are even more directly individual personality traits which control our interactions independent of our wishes. In Dubus's universe, it seems that there is no free will, just characters interacting and progressing according to deterministic laws which control the outcomes. Though this may sound dry and intellectual, it is witnessed by Dubus with tenderness and compassion, with attention to the character's inner lives and to their suffering when outcomes don't match desires. In Bluesman, there is a countercurrent, which is that found in artistic expression. Here is where an individual can express themselves freely, with personal agency, and find relief from their suffering. As the main protagonist, Leo Suther, is described sinking into playing blues numbers on his harmonicas, we the readers feel a palpable relief from the almost unbearable suffering that Leo is undergoing in the other moments of his life, and we share in the joy of deep artistic expression. Interestingly, such a countercurrent seems to be absent in \"House of Sand and Fog.\""}, {"userName": "David Clark", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2401143-david-clark", "userReview": "I find much to enjoy and admire in Andre Dubus's prose. His writing creates lyrical but lean sentences that often produces a kind of wonder that forces me to ask: How did he do that?The novel Bluesman surely holds much lovely writing with spot-on era-appropriate descriptions and excellent dialogue. However, I confess it was the story that ultimately disappointed. The coming-of-age story of young Leo Struther and his first love Allie starts well enough, but does not \"finish.\" As a writer, I know how difficult it is to land a complex story. Most authors have at least one story in the drawer that contained a brilliant start but crashed in the final chapters. In particular, I want a novel to show the reader how the circumstances of the story (OK, the \"crisis\") changed the way the protagonist(s) see the world or themselves. This sense of change does not need to result in better choices or resolution. However, the reader needs to gain a sense that the characters at the end of the book are somehow different than when the novel's started. I reached the last page with a growing sense of disappointment. I could not--other than some obvious conclusions such as 1) Always wise to use birth control 2) Army recruiters should not be believed 3) Be wise about making unpopular public political statements--discern if the two young protagonists were \"wiser\" or \"changed\" by the journey we took together. This critique is not to say I did not enjoy reading the novel. As a musician, I was delighted by the author's use of music as an important story element. In short, a pleasant but not earthshaking read. Unfortunately, Bluesman doesn't nearly reach the level of a novel I would re-read."}, {"userName": "Joel Mongeon", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41520983-joel-mongeon", "userReview": "Summer of Love? Check. Small town in Massachusetts? Check. Vietnam? Check. Everything I like reading about is present in this book. So why didn't I like it? I guess the story felt contrived to me. The protagonist is from such an insular community and it felt like all the themes of late-60's America were being forced on the setting by the author. And yes, the diversity of characters is such that the fictional Heywood, MA can be seen as a microcosm of all of America during 1967. But I don't think those characters were utilized the best they could be. It bothers me that the book is written in third person but the narrator seems to only empathize with Leo, who has very little depth to his character.I was pretty into this book for the first hundred pages or so. But after a certain point the backdrop seemed to stopped having an effect on the story. About half way through I started seeing Leo as very selfish. And sure, most 18-year-olds are selfish. But that aside, it felt like Leo just totally lacked empathy for anyone else in the story, with the exception (maybe) of his father and his surrogate uncle. His autistic-level obsession with the harmonica can be frustrating to read about, as it dictates way too many of his decisions. Between that and his behavior towards the love interest, I was actually surprised that Leo didn't end up insane by the end of the book. Then again, I predicted the ending pretty early on. And the ending is the mostly selfish part of it all, but I won't spoil it.P.S. If I had to read that damn \"Love Abode\" song one more time..."}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2174829-matt", "userReview": "Despite giving this 4 stars I was kind of disappointed in it. The writing and mood of the book are great. Dubus does a great job of having that bluesy feeling permeate the story and really makes it feel poignant.However. This is basically an incredibly un-unique story about angsty teens, summer love, and thinking about their future. A pretty standard and plain bildungsroman. What happens in this story has happened to millions of kids and been told in hundreds of books. The romance is standard puppy love, kids make bad decisions, they think the fate of the world hangs on what they do next, etc. etc. yawn yawn.I think Dubus even acknowledges this when one of the characters parents makes a comment about how nothing that happens to these kids is something they can't overcome in the future (even if they make the worst possible decision).I think the inherent uninterestingness of the plot compared to my rating should give a sense of just how well this book is written. It has a smooth rhythmic flow, and although blues doesn't play a huge role in the plot, the writing just drips with that style. This book is incredibly readable and I will definitely pick up another by Dubus and am disappointed to see he only has a few novels.On a fun note. I just found out that my boss is friends with Andre Dubus III and his family. Apparently they grew up together on the North shore of Mass. I will be picking his brain thoroughly and am very glad that I have great things to say about the writing."}, {"userName": "Pat", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5166924-pat", "userReview": "After the stunning \"House of Sand and Fog,\" I guess I was a bit let down by this coming-of-age story set in small-town Mass. in the late '60s. I certainly remember the times when the nation was teetering in its support for Nam and boys were sweating having to register for the draft.Leo just seems to float through life, buffeted by whatever wind blows his way. I never really CARED about him as a protagonist. The ease with which he becomes a harmonica virtuoso is laughably in accurate, and I never really felt his commitment to jazz.Allie is an appropriate first-love object, and her pregnancy is a surprise. Those were the days when abortion was still illegal, but plenty of girls got them. Leo fantasizes about being a dad and husband, but how would he really have performed in that role? His memories of the idolized, doomed Katie Fay are the only images he has of women. That the headstrong Allie cannot fit into them is inevitable. Jim the dad struggles to raise his son, while remaining detached from him. Leo makes a knee-jerk reaction to losing Allie (and his baby) by stupidly believing the recruiters promise that he will be sent to Europe to play in a jazz band--instead of the jungles of SE Asia."}, {"userName": "Ian", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3652044-ian", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this novel. Set in late 1960's small town America - Massachusetts to be precise - it is primarily a tale about the relationship between a naive, romantic 17 year old boy and a much more grounded 16 year old girl. The boy is Leo, the Bluesman of the title and the girl is called Ellie.It's a fairly simple tale of boy meets girl set against the prevailing themes of late 60's America: the Civil Rights movement, the Vietnam war and the Summer of Love. But these are all just ripples in the background most of the time and the primary backdrop is the passion for blues music shared by Leo, his father Jim and Jim's best friend. As the teenage relationship goes through ups and downs, there is always the blues for Leo to come back to.The character of Leo, who is the main narrator is particularly well drawn. He is a lovable, romantic dreamer fixated on his seemingly constant erections and always drawn first to describing a woman's breasts before any other particular feature. In other words a very believable teenage male.Although simple, I found this novel beguiling and would not hesitate to recommend it."}, {"userName": "Richp", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10859374-richp", "userReview": "Dubus sets this novel up as if it might turn out to be the great American novel, but he fails to follow through on some of his themes (war and communist v capitalist) and doesn't get much farther on his main one, young love and sex and growing up. Stuff just happens. And, given the critical importance of Allie, her character is not explored much at all: we don't know why she is the way she is. Aside from Leo, the only character we see into (more than a moderate amount) is his mother, who died years before the novel opens.I grew up in a similar world, but on the eastern part of the state, and in time between Leo and his author. I knew and grew up with similar people, but with characteristics combined in different ways. I knew many of the cultural references, recognizing most of the blues musicians and all the Red Sox stuff. So, I was definitely synched with the scene and predisposed to like this. It fell short, but probably that is not so bad.

It's not well known like THE HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG and THE GARDEN OF LAST DAYS. This is a true coming-of-age story. Leo is about to turn 18 and he loves Allie. It is a summer of love for both of them with all of the angst and good and bad that such love brings. The time is 1967, deep into the Vietnam War (which we all know wasn't really a war). All the pathos and joy of first love is explored in detail. To tell any more would spoil the story.I loved this book, especially after recently reading TOWNIE, Dubus's autobiography.

This book, an early output from him, took me a while to get into. The story of a working class boy coming of age in New England in the 60's was interesting enough but I found the detailed musical descriptions distracting at first. I got used to these (though I never really understood them) and grew to understand how important they were in understanding the culture of the family group the boy was living in.
