It is, however, a memoir about a twenty-something who struggles with overindulging in a variety of areas in her life. We hear about her alcoholism, her weight loss journey, her career moves, her romantic relationships, and her family. The information about the shopping ban is minimal. There are 8 pages at the end which outline some practical steps to declutter and live with less.Unfortunately, the title is misleading.

Yeah, it's a 'one-year of __' (doing something, living in another place/country etc.) book, but it's a good one of that kind, and you can trust that all information you can gather to apply on yourself will be there at the end of the book, and you don't have to pick anything as you read. There is a also a small number of resources the personal guide.So: the author - who has already recently conquered her debts, alcoholism, bad eating habits, and ended one destructive relationship (with connection to the alcoholism point) - gets an idea of taking a year off her usual way of consumerism, with some rules on what is allowable to buy and what is not allowed (with some soon-to-be-needing-replacement items listed separately - which she can buy when the time comes). Seems a bit hard at first, but as she keeps going, it gets easier, and she discovers so much more, things that change her life for the better.A year of discoveries: how to fix things, watch less tv/Netflix, change habits, starting new traditions, finding good friends, dealing with things instead of relapse/hiding, realising what she wants to do for living.And a crisis or two: another broken relationship (but less toxic), losing some friends, parents' divorce, increasing frustration with current job... which leads her to find the type of job she likes eventually.She starts with decluttering most of what she owns, and experiences some shopping cravings, similar to what she had with some older habits. She realises she needs to break some behavior habits to become a better person, like speaking up, and what to do when you feel down. She does have one shopping relapse, but she now knows how to react to it, both in action and in how she talks about it to herself. She learns to appreciate her parents' skills (though she can't learn them all, fe. she has no green thumb skills with plants). She realises she needs to keep an emergency fund, not just save for good things like travel or a restaurant dinner. She decides to not just quit a bad job, but move to a smaller city as she prefers a slower pace place more.It's a really fruitful year for her, and she really deoes become a better person in a better place in life. The story flows really well, and I could tell it was a good book in how I wanted to keep reading it beyond the usual daily amount, and finished it quick. I might not do it in the same way, but it has got me thinking about my own use of money, and what I should do with things I have (I might use some decluttering-centred book for the latter, though, besides what is here...)A good book to add to your collection, and very nice to see this be: decluttering + saving book!

You can start by not spending money on this book. 99 percent of it is self indulgent millennial whining. I picked it up because I had read The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up and while parts of that book were kooky, it did help me declutter my house and think about what I wanted to keep. So I thought this book might help me tackle the front end of the problem. How do I learn to buy less stuff in the first place, such that I have less crud to tidy. For me it was less about saving money and more about being a thoughtful consumer. I wanted to think about what I bought and why, what gets treasured as a meaningful purchase versus stuffed in a closet, and perhaps a few thoughts and stats on consumerism generally. Nope. What I got was endless whining about boyfriend breakups, binge eating, alcoholism, mommy and daddy's divorce, and work complaints. And lots and lots of lots of stories about buying expensive coffee and candles. The only even slightly useful bit of the book is in the last 6 or so pages. I suggest you go read On Walden Pond again instead."}, {"userName": "Jenny (adultishbooks)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3772692-jenny-adultishbooks", "userReview": "I have been a big fan of Cait Flanders for over two years now. Her story of debt repayment and subsequent shopping ban inspired me to pay off my own debt between 2015-2016. This book was the most anticipated release for 2017 for me. I rarely buy books anymore but I pre-ordered the Kindle version since I wanted to support Cait and give back a snippet of what she\u2019s given me.I am very familiar with the ins and outs of Cait\u2019s shopping ban and I was worried that this book was be repetitive to her blog or the stories she\u2019s told on several podcasts. This goes deeper and provides new content which I am relieved by. I blew through this in two days so it\u2019s definitely a fast read I will revisit in the future (hence why I purchased a digital copy). I wish it was longer and more fleshed out since I am so fascinated by her shopping ban. Still, this is one of the better minimalism books on the market and a good, gentle easing into stopping or curbing mindless consumption. I also appreciated the candor regarding her struggles with drinking and how that weaved into her story of simply not shopping. Her voice is strong and consistent with the Cait Flanders I know from her podcast and blog so it doesn\u2019t feel edited or written by the editor. Overall, I highly recommend this and since her story overall means so much to me, I couldn\u2019t give her any less than five stars."}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6203318-emma", "userReview": "Interesting concept... a whole year of not buying unnecessary items and clearing your home so it's not cluttered with the things you don't use regularly.

It's her journey. But I did not know this would be a memoir, like many readers I thought it would be more of a guide to, well, living with less.Being that I do not have an addictive personality, though I have family members who do, I see where she was coming from and what her struggle was. However, if I had wanted to read a self-help guide on being sober, I would...have not, as I don't drink.Very minimal info towards the end, AFTER the epilogue, yes I said AFTER the epilogue on what I came for. Many repetitious phrases throughout that may have been stylistic but ended up as padding.I also felt a lot of reverse snobbery, i.e.. I don't need designer purses and pretty dresses and makeup but if you like it I guess that's okay for YOU. But not for me, never for ME! I only spent my money before I stopped spending my money on books and travel! UGH. It got a little didactic. Honey, if you don't want to wear a little mascara and lipstick, fine.

It occurred to me that there were two basic types of self-destructive people: the ones who aren't entirely convinced that becoming less self-destructive will actually make their lives better (see, e.g., Cat Marnell), and the ones who really genuinely want to become less self-destructive. I decided I wasn't in the right mood to read about the former and instead picked up a book about the latter: The Year of Less, in which Cait Flanders, who has already battled alcoholism, food issues, and a mountain of credit-card debt, decides to tackle her consumerism by not buying anything unnecessary for an entire year.The Year of Less lived up to my expectations. Flanders takes the bull by the horns so readily that it's a bit hard to believe she used to be such a mess. But in twelve chapters (each corresponding to one month of her shopping ban) she takes us through her past, describing her various attempts to stop drinking and what helped her finally quit; the food binging she also eventually quit; the consumerism that led her to accumulate $30,000 in debt, and the discipline that helped her pay it off in a couple of years. All of this was honestly inspiring to read about, and when she set her sights on Not Buying Anything, I was excited to see what would happen. All was great for several chapters, at which point things started to get a little samey and the book got a little tedious. This was disappointing because I'd been enjoying myself so much up to that point.If I'm being honest, at the same time the book got a bit tedious, it also got a bit disturbing, at least for me. By her own description, Flanders was a pretty hard-core user of drugs and alcohol for a while, and she also clearly did have major issues around food and shopping: She describes having \"blackouts,\" after which she'd come to having eaten everything in sight or purchased things online, without remembering any of it. The fact that she was willing to give up these crutches is admirable, but I began to feel as if she was using her new minimalism as another type of crutch. At the beginning of the book, in an effort to pare down, Flanders gives away a large percentage of her belongings\u2014clothes, unread books, toiletries\u2014anything she's had for a long time without using. This is all well and good, but midway through the book, while going through a hard time emotionally, Flanders immediately turns to her sparse remaining belongings and starts getting rid of even more. This seemed so clearly motivated by her current pain that I couldn't understand why she didn't recognize it, even while writing about it after the fact.After this episode, it was hard to see Flanders's experiment in a purely benign way. Flanders refers to herself as a \"reader,\" but she gives away even more of her books because she decides she bought them for an idealized, \"smarter\" version of herself. I sort of see what she means, but it disturbed me that she kept insisting she would never be \"smart\" enough for these books. Never ever? What were they, advanced astrophysics texts? Around this time, Flanders also decides to \"simplify\" her life even further by... growing her own vegetables on her apartment patio, making her own candles, and even making her own cleaning products (!). How does this simplify anything? The whole thing took on a weird compulsiveness that made no sense to me. Then there's the way Flanders also attempts to give up TV but keeps coming up with excuses to watch more of it. So the books have to go, but the reality shows get to stay? The image of her sitting in her mostly empty apartment, glued to TV shows on her laptop, just didn't convey the sense of inner peace she claimed she was achieving.And that's the thing: Except in a brief section about a road trip Flanders takes with a friend, I really wasn't feeling the peace or the joy. Part of this may just be the limitations of Flanders's writing\u2014all of the emotions are more understood than felt, by the reader and seemingly by Flanders herself. She does try to head critics off at the pass by reminding us that everyone is different, and just because we may not want to live like she does doesn't mean she can't be happy that way. Which I agree with! I just didn't think she seemed all that happy. I know she wouldn't want this, but I feel a little sad for her. Fiscal responsibility is important, but there's a lot of middle ground between rampant consumerism and a completely barren apartment. Things are part of who we are. They can bring us joy, make us feel more ourselves, make us feel more at home. I'd like to read another memoir by Flanders in 15 years and see if she still feels exactly the same.As for this current memoir, it was fine: Well written, readable, likable, serviceable, but ultimately disposable. Given Flanders's penchant for tossing everything, maybe she'd see that last bit as a compliment.I won this book in a Goodreads giveaway.

It is a memoir and should be reviewed as such. I had to check how Cait Flanders categorized her book after the first few chapters and was pleased to confirm that she was in fact writing a memoir. (Although she does include a perfect little \u201chow to\u201d at the end of her journey in the epilogue.)I cringed when she started to say that she was a blogger \u2013 I have had a couple bad reads from bloggers-turned-book authors \u2013 but quickly understood that Flanders was an exception to my experience. Her voice is honest and humble in true Canadian fashion. There is nothing flashy about her life or story, which makes it accessible to anyone endeavoring to read her book.The timeline is sometimes a little confusing \u2013 what job does she have now? Wait, is this during the challenge or before? What city is she living in? These chronological blips can be overlooked since we get the whole story by the end, but it made for a little extra puzzle-piecing throughout.Luckily, I grew up with a mom who instilled saving (or, more importantly and in line with this book, not spending) in me from my first allowances. Today, I don\u2019t think not spending is an inherent trait \u2013 if you are living in North America, it\u2019s easier to spend than not, especially when money is available that you don\u2019t actually have (credit cards). I have my own strategies for battling the constant barrage of advertisements, temptations, and \u201cneeds,\u201d and it was very cool to see Flanders express her journey so publicly.Ultimately, The Year of Less: How I Stopped Shopping, Gave Away My Belongings, and Discovered Life Is Worth More Than Anything You Can Buy in a Store is a book about struggle, reconciliation with oneself, and adaptation. An easy read and one without too much drama so it was easy to flip, flip, flip\u2026 we get the idea pretty early on and toboggan along with Flanders through her year of less. I think one of her main points is to inspire others to do the same in a pursuit of happiness, and I have to believe that this book will do exactly that for more than a couple people."}, {"userName": "Lauren", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9871700-lauren", "userReview": "Didn't know this was 99% memoir and 1% how-to-minimize-and-declutter-your-life going into it.

The reader only gets to know one specific instance when the author almost bought something not approved on Black Friday... other than that, this whole book read like \"it was easy for me to get rid of my belongings and I didn't really struggle with not buying anything for 12 months, but here's the story of how I grew up:...\" I admire her opening up about her repeated attempts at sobriety but it took up about half of this 200ish page book and the finished product just wasn't what I thought it would be.

I do not believe I gave any spoilers, but read with caution**I was excited to come across this book and pre-ordered it based on the title and description.

There was almost NOTHING in this book regarding the life in the year of less in regards to \"how I stopped shopping and gave away my belongings\". In the first bit there is a page or two on decluttering her house. At the end there is \"10 things\" list of how to succeed at this. Somewhere just past the halfway mark of the book was a page or so on an actual situation of purchase during the ban. At points I am not even sure she remembered she was writing a book about her own rule of \"no take-out coffee\" as that seemed to only apply when she was alone. She certainly spent money outside of the home on coffee and food when she was with people. And the traveling. My word. I believe she spent 10 grand in that year on travelling. Even that was odd seeing as how her boyfriend, who was long distance, and herself split the costs of travel and costs when one was the host. I thought this book would be about not spending and it was a book about her past and current 20 something year old life. VERY DISAPPOINTED.

I think some who have reviewed it here were looking for a self help book, but it is actually a memoir with a tiny amount of self help ideas. As a memoir I thought it was interesting. It is about a young woman, Cait Flanders, that is dealing with her over consumption. I think we can call it that, but perhaps it is even more about finding what is important in life. Is all this stuff around us really that important? When it comes to over consumption I have my own problem. I buy books. And more to the point, I buy books in bulk, boxes of them, or have done so during certain periods of my life. I currently own something like 3.000 to 5.000 printed books. That is a lot. If I ever move again I will definitely get a hernia from carrying boxes of books. The thing is, there are books in my collection that I absolutely adore, and continue to re read, but there are other books that I\u2019ve read, and know I will never read again. These books are still in my collection because I bought them, or somebody gave them to me. So they take up space, but don\u2019t add anything to my life anymore.Anyway that\u2019s my problem. Flanders had a slightly different problem, but book tells the story of mostly one year, but also goes back to the beginning of her problems. So the reader gets her life story, and not just the story of that one year. Her story is not that unusual. In fact, I think it is very, very usual in our world today.

But I think I could have published my diary too."}, {"userName": "Robin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1496564-robin", "userReview": "An easy-to-read sort-of memoir about a young woman coming out of a number of years of alcoholism, overeating, and over-spending, and realizing that money and things don't buy happiness. Her point is not necessarily in writing a \"how-to\" book on simplifying life but more of becoming inspiration in getting to anyone wanting to get to that point. There is a short section at the end with practical advice. However, if a reader doesn't necessarily need the motivation to simplify their life and simply wants more on \"how-to\" to do it, there are better books available. They include Marie Kondo's sometimes silly THE LIFE-CHANGING MAGIC OF TIDYING UP, Jeff Yeager's Ultimate Cheapskate series, Levin's NOT BUYING IT, and the book that started it for me years ago, Elaine St. James' SIMPLIFY YOUR LIFE. Also, a book that helped me tame my \"digital\" and paper clutter was Fay Wolf's NEW ORDER. For those who want to go to extreme minimalism, check out Sasaki's GOODBYE THINGS. Also check the GoodReads lists for \"Simple Living & Minimalism.\"And yes, I am a bit addicted to life simplification porn. And yes, I do always strive to keep my \"stuff\" to a minimum--except clothes and books, you know the important things in life. :-)"}, {"userName": "Kate Kaput", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2875120-kate-kaput", "userReview": "I've been reading Cait Flanders' personal finance blog for a few years, on & off. Sometimes, when I feel guilty about my inability to manage my finances, I skip her posts in my feed reader & move on to whatever's next. Sometimes, I save up a bunch of her posts & read them all at once for a double dose of inspiration & reproach.When I saw that Cait had written her first book, I knew I had to get my hands on it - & that was before Vogue named it one of \"7 Nonfiction Books to Change Your Life in 2018.\" Equal parts memoir & self-help, it's called The Year of Less: How I Stopped Shopping, Gave Away My Belongings, and Discovered Life Is Worth More Than Anything You Can Buy in a Store.Whew, that's a verbose title - but the book itself, of course, is all about thoughtful minimalism.I listened to Cait's audiobook & started thinking of all the things I've purchased lately that I probably (OK, definitely) didn't need. I decided it was time to embark on my own Year of Less, whatever that means to me. I don't have the same personality as Cait or the same priorities; I wouldn't want to own just one pair of jeans, & I care more about makeup & skincare products. I'm also never going to give up my lattes, expense be damned, because going to the coffee shop to get them is sometimes the only socialization I get in a day. (Ah, that work-from-home life.)Still, I finished the book feeling inspired & motivated to try my own version of a Year of Less. Maybe it won't be a year, & I'm sure I'll never be as thoughtful & intentional about it as Cait is/was. But I've started making small changes & have already begun to feel the benefits of these efforts. I feel calmer, more at peace, less claustrophobic - & I want to feel more of that.Absolutely worth a read, especially if you want to jump-start your own efforts at thoughtful ownership."}, {"userName": "Jessica Coffin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2618022-jessica-coffin", "userReview": "Was going to try and soldier through this, since it's fairly short, but just COULDN'T. Really missed the mark for me, who wanted to know more details about what the book says it's about, and less of an autobiography."}, {"userName": "Spencer Lebel", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/78015841-spencer-lebel", "userReview": "A disappointing read with a misleading title and description. The \u201cbook\u201d is essentially 12 seperate blog posts stitched together into a personal timeline diary of Cait Flander\u2019s life. And it\u2019s not even a well-written diary at that. There are several repeat sentences and you will see content from chapter one come up again in chapter seven, nine, twelve and essentially the entire remainder of the book. The process of living a \u201cyear of less\u201d should have been published as an infographic on Flander\u2019s blog and left at that. Save your money and start your year of less by not purchasing this book.That being said, I admire Flander\u2019s courage in being able to show vulnerability in allowing her readers a look into her personal life. I just didn\u2019t find value in the time spent reading this book."}], "description": "WALL STREET JOURNAL BESTSELLERIn her late twenties, Cait Flanders found herself stuck in the consumerism cycle that grips so many of us: earn more, buy more, want more, rinse, repeat. Even after she worked her way out of nearly $30,000 of consumer debt, her old habits took hold again. When she realized that nothing she was doing or buying was making her happy\u2014only keeping her from meeting her goals\u2014she decided to set herself a challenge:\u00a0she would not shop for an entire year.The Year of Less\u00a0documents Cait\u2019s life for twelve months during which she bought only consumables: groceries, toiletries, gas for her car. Along the way, she challenged herself to consume less of many other things besides shopping. She decluttered her apartment and got rid of 70 percent of her belongings; learned how to fix things rather than throw them away; researched the zero waste movement; and completed a television ban. At every stage, she learned that the less she consumed, the more fulfilled she felt.The challenge became a lifeline when, in the course of the year, Cait found herself in situations that turned her life upside down. In the face of hardship, she realized why she had always turned to shopping, alcohol, and food\u2014and what it had cost her. Unable to reach for any of her usual vices, she changed habits she\u2019d spent years perfecting and discovered what truly mattered to her.Blending Cait\u2019s compelling story with inspiring insight and practical guidance,\u00a0The Year of Less\u00a0will leave you questioning what you\u2019re holding on to in your own life\u2014and, quite possibly, lead you to find your own path of\u00a0less.", "title": "The Year of Less: How I Stopped Shopping, Gave Away My Belongings, and Discovered Life Is Worth More Than Anything You Can Buy in a Store", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35488858-the-year-of-less", "average": 3.62, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1508469293l/35488858.jpg", "reviews": 568, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16967485.Cait_Flanders", "name": "Cait Flanders"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Autobiography", "Self Help"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35488858-the-year-of-less", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36432905-the-year-of-less", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36862107-the-year-of-less"]}
