I loved this story! It is a very quick read because you won\u2019t want to put it down!In a Kiss and a Dream, Gretchen is in such dire circumstances that she and the two little ones with her almost freeze to death trying to reach a better life. It is only by God\u2019s grace that Kian stumbles upon her and the little ones as he is out on a job.The story that unfolds is such a sweet one that made me smile. The characters in this book are very well written and believable. I could see how people in the town would feel ill-will toward Gretchen because of her German heritage. It was a different time then and people were truly afraid of Germans. But I can also see that God requires us to show mercy and love to those in need. It is a quandary we still face today with immigration being such a hot subject. I love how in spite of a lot of the town\u2019s opinions, Kian still take Gretchen in.I enjoyed reading how Gretchen brings life back to Kian\u2019s family while they bring life to her as well. This book has a bit of suspense thrown in too. This is definitely one I recommend to those of you who love clean historical fiction!"}, {"userName": "Englishrose", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5165562-englishrose", "userReview": "This was a compelling and very interesting read. I loved the setting, both dealing with the effects of the war as well as the small town feel. It was definitely part of a series (one I'd love to read more of) but stood on its own well. Gretchen was a wonderful character, both hard working and strong. Kian is a romantic reluctant hero. They both balance well their selfish motivations for needing the other with their obvious desire for a real relationship. There are several great twists and turns that kept me dying for a happy ending. It was a sweet and lovely romance. Great side characters, obviously borrowed from earlier books, made you feel like you really were there in the small, close-knit community. I must say, I loved it.www.cleanromancereviews.com"}, {"userName": "Aimee (Getting Your Read On)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1934633-aimee-getting-your-read-on", "userReview": "3.5 starsThis book was really sweet. The beginning pulls you in right away as a young woman struggles through bitter cold, ice and snow, to save herself and two young children. I could not help but feel so much sympathy, empathy and compassion for both Gretchen and Kian. They have heart wrenching stories and they both deserve to love and be loved.I enjoyed this book, even though I felt like some things were underdeveloped. I read through this book quickly and was so very happy at the outcome. So sweet!"}, {"userName": "Melissa Ann", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1743953-melissa-ann", "userReview": "A very gripping read."}, {"userName": "A Leisure Moment", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28865568-a-leisure-moment", "userReview": "Historical fiction is always a great get away when reading. Especially when there is a touch of romance. However, this love story does come with a price. Two people surrounded by turmoil, secrets and pain. Maybe, just maybe there will be a glimpse of hope for them both. Linda Andrews has created two stories in one. Both Gretchen and Kian have their own struggles, but it\u2019s Andrew\u2019s attention to details of the story line carefully crafted together, joining their stories of distress, into one. One story of need and hope in the town of High Point. Although the story does not start off quickly, Gretchen and Kian\u2019s commitment to a better a life quickly takes flight as their story begins.Read this review and more!"}, {"userName": "Victoria", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10930429-victoria", "userReview": "Is a great book to read"}], "description": "She escapes with a dead woman's name and finds sanctuary with a widower reeling from his wife's betrayal.
