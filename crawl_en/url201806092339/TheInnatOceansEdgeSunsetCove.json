I'm such a fan of books and of the authors who write them. I will always point out the positive when writing a review. The positive points of Colleen Coble's The Inn at Oceans Edge is that the concept of this mystery was a good one. Unfortunately, the execution of it was horrible.Claire heads to Maine to assist her father in merger that they hope will save their hotel. Once she steps foot inside she has a panic attack but isn't sure why she is so distressed. To relax, she talks a walk along Maine coast and meets Luke. After a quick run in he asks her if she is the same Claire that went missing for a year when she was 4. Claire was clueless. Her parents had never told her. Up to this point I had hopes for the book. The descriptions of the coast pulled me in and I thought hmmm... this may get interesting.For me it went downhill very quickly from there. There are a sequence of events that follow that are ridiculous only because of the complete lack of emotion. For example, if you witnessed someone get thrown off a cliff and the body landed at your feet, it may freak you out about right? How about if you turn the body over and noticed I KNOW this person!!! Traumatic no? Not for Claire. Not even when she gets knocked over the head at scene and wakes up to the body being snatched. Claire simply goes back to hotel and is more concerned about her parents telling her about her disappearance.I'm sorry but c'mon. This girl had a panic attack a few hours earlier the sees a murdered acquaintance and it's like she was in a fender bender. This is all in the first chapters.The book does have twists and turns that could've made this a great mystery. It just did not contain the character development to pull off any emotional connection. As the mystery unfolded I found myself rolling eyes. I don't think this would have been the case had I been connected to the characters. Again, great concept. Just too one dimensional. Thank you to the publisher and Netgalley for the advanced copy in exchange for this honest review."}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4075354-beth", "userReview": "Colleen Coble is another author that I\u2019m a little behind the curve on reading, and I hope to remedy that further in the future. The Inn at Ocean\u2019s Edge is only the second of her novels that I\u2019ve read, and while I wasn\u2019t blown away by the other novel, this one was a great suspenseful read. This novel provides really great set up for upcoming books in the series, while still in keeping with what appears to be Colleen\u2019s trademark romantic suspense.I think what impressed me most with this story is how quickly the action starts. I love how it starts off with a bang and doesn\u2019t let up until the end. It\u2019s hard to talk about this type of story line without accidentally giving any spoilers, but I was held fast by the mystery. There are several surprising elements, and while some of my suspicions proved to be correct, there were many instances that I wasn\u2019t sure what was going on with certain characters or plotlines. The story ended up being much more layered and intricate than I was expecting, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching everything unfold. There were a few scenes that I thought ended in an odd way, as if it needed just a few more sentences to give it a better sense of completeness, but it may be something that wouldn\u2019t bother super-fans of suspense. While I enjoy it, it\u2019s not the genre that I read most often, so this could just be me.The characters, for the most part, react realistically to what is going on around them, and the less desirable characters don\u2019t come off as caricatures, which is often a complaint of mine. Although my life is nothing like Claire\u2019s life, I still found ways to relate to her. There were times that I could have used a bit more depth for the main characters; I did think they had realistic back story\u2019s that created great conflict for their current circumstances. Colleen gives Claire small but impactful characteristics that add a lot of realism to her character and the same can be said of Luke\u2019s character as well.Colleen also does a great job in writing the romance realistically into the story; the romantic moments are genuinely sweet yet realistic and fall naturally within the story\u2019s flow. While Claire and Luke aren\u2019t complete opposites, there\u2019s a softness to him that Claire is drawn to. Their scenes had a spark from the very beginning.The setting is another area that is really well-done. Although I\u2019ve never been to Maine, I feel like I\u2019ve at least been on its coast because of this story. I could easily envision Hotel Tourmaline, as well as the natural landscape of the setting, whether it was a rocky cliff, sandy beach or a cranberry bog. This is a random side note, but I\u2019ve loved the names of her more recent titles \u2013 this one gives off a sense of place, as well as a sense of excitement and, perhaps even danger, especially with the words, \u201cocean\u2019s edge.\u201d Despite it being a hotel more than an inn, the title is very evocative of the story overall.Fans of suspense and of Colleen\u2019s past novels are sure to enjoy this one. Even I, an unseasoned suspense reader, flew through the pages once the mystery hooked me, and I definitely hope to read the next book in the Sunset Cove series."}, {"userName": "Katherine Jones", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8011063-katherine-jones", "userReview": "I never like saying I couldn\u2019t get into a novel, especially one like this with so much clout behind it. I want to get hooked on every book I read. Unfortunately, that didn\u2019t happen here.It wasn\u2019t the story itself, which is\u2013in and of itself\u2013intriguing. Rather, it was something, somehow, in the way it was told. Starting, perhaps, with the way that I didn\u2019t feel the author trusted me, the reader, to connect obvious dots. Like in this brief snatch of narrative: \u201cWhat had gotten into her today? First experiencing a panic attack and then jumping to unwarranted conclusions.\u201d This came on page 15, which meant I\u2019d read about these two things (the panic attack and the jumping to conclusions) only a page or two before. I\u2019m not likely to have forgotten so quickly what I was just so well shown.I felt there was also a heavier reliance on clich\u00e9 than I\u2019d prefer. (\u201c\u2026her first impression was of impossibly dark eyes that seemed to look right into her soul. He would have been right at home on the cover of a pirate romance.\u201d page 14)And sometimes the dialogue felt stilted, as when characters used what they were saying to explain backstory to another character who would already be in the know. For example, \u201d \u2018He hasn\u2019t hit you again, has he? I thought he stopped that after I threatened him when I was eighteen.\u2019 \u201d (page 8, emphasis mine)And then there were passages like this, which to me just didn\u2019t ring true:\u201d \u2018You\u2019re wearing a peculiar expression, Claire. And look at you. No shoes. You\u2019re filthy, and your hair is a wreck. What happened to you this afternoon? Your father even called the sheriff. Are you all right?\u2019\u201d \u2018I\u2019m fine, Mom. Some guy killed the woman at the counter when I checked in, Jenny Bennett. I called the sheriff, but the killer sneaked up on me and hit me over the head.\u2019 When her mother gasped, Claire shook her head. \u2018I\u2019m okay. The sheriff is looking for him.\u2019 \u201d (page 33)Really? All this talk of a killer and a brush with death delivered without a quiver? I don\u2019t think so. Not in my world, anyway.I\u2019m sorry to sound so crushing. Could it be I lack an appreciation for the trademarks of this genre? Perhaps. I would certainly point to the author\u2019s huge fan base and bestselling, award-winning status and urge other readers to take my take with a grain of salt.Because, on the plus side, The Inn at Ocean\u2019s Edge did have plenty of atmospheric suspense, plus a wealth of layered mystery, twists, complications, and original sub-plotting (including an incident involving an orca whale! I\u2019ll admit I\u2019ve not seen that one before). And, though I wasn\u2019t much taken with the rest of the story, the ending was\u2013to me, at least\u2013satisfyingly unpredictable.Thanks to BookLook Bloggers for providing me a free copy to review.

The story is richly layered around the theme of what makes us a family. Is it blood relationships? Is it love? Is it something else? Claire Dellamare arrives at Hotel Tourmaline ready to help her father close a merger with another company. But the moment she arrives, she has a flashback or panic attack that sends her running for the ocean. Luke Rocco is in a quandary deciding between staying in the Coast Guard or coming home to run the family's cranberry bogs. Soon he's in the middle of helping Claire unravel the truth about her past and his mother.There are threads of murder, kidnapping, and so much more. For the quiet shore of Maine, there's a lot of crime surrounding Claire -- something that keeps the sheriff unsure of what's really happening. Through it all, Claire and Luke stay the path in their dogged pursuit of truth. At the same time another character is equally determined to find the truth --regardless of the cost -- because her life depends on it. The story has a strong romantic thread and several subplots that all come together before you reach the end. But the strongest part of this story is the exploration of family. Readers of Colleen Coble's other books will enjoy this first book set on the Maine coast. It will also delight those who love a strong romantic mystery."}, {"userName": "Aerykah", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5920961-aerykah", "userReview": "I love this author-- she's a long-time favorite of mine. Her writing style almost always draws me in from the moment I start reading and refuses to let me go until after I close the book.This book was wonderful! I really enjoyed it. The characters were great and the plot was terrific!However, I figured out too much of the mystery too far before the end of the book. It was still pretty intense, though. That alone wouldn't have made me take the rating down a star, but there were a few scenes that were a bit... I don't know-- rough feeling? Abrupt? I don't know how to explain it, it just didn't feel entirely smooth to me. And there was one scene I distinctly remember where a character was called by another character's name.

I decided to read it anyway, hoping that the emphasis would be on the suspense/mystery, but I find that I can't get past the characters themselves.So far, everyone seems to be highly successful and beautiful, and the writing is ridiculous. For example, the male lead is in the coast guard and when his appearance is described, these sentences happen: \"...impossibly dark eyes that seemed to look right into her soul. He would have been right at home on the cover of a pirate romance.\" (p. 9) Seriously? As for the female lead, \"...cute was hardly the word for Claire. Drop-dead gorgeous was more like it.\" (p. 23) She works with her CEO father and is helping him with a business merger.

She showed up a year later at the same hotel, with a note pinned to her dress but no explanation. Nobody knows where Claire spent that year\u2014and until now, Claire didn\u2019t even know she had ever been missing.But when Claire returns to the Hotel Tourmaline for a business meeting with her CEO father, disturbing memories begin to surface . . . despite her parents\u2019 best efforts to keep them forgotten.Luke Rocco lost his mother under equally mysterious circumstances\u2014at the same time Claire disappeared. After a chance encounter reveals the unlikely link between them, Claire and Luke set out together to uncover the truth about what happened that fateful year.With flashbacks swimming just beneath her consciousness and a murderer threatening her safety, Claire\u2019s very life depends on unscrambling her past . . . even if her family refuses to acknowledge it. Someone\u2014maybe everyone\u2014is hiding something from Claire Dellamare, and it will cost her everything to drag the truth out into the light.THE INN AT OCEAN\u2019S EDGE is the first book in Ms. Coble\u2019s new series, A Sunset Cove. I enjoyed getting to know Luke and Claire. Claire is a typical rich girl who had it all handed to her on a silver platter\u2014on one hand. On the other, she is not at all as she seems. Luke is kind and loving, but suspicious and firm. I loved how he believed whole-heartedly in Claire even though he just met her. At first I thought this book might be somewhat predictable. I figured out who-dun-it fairly early on. But then Ms. Coble threw unexpected twists in the plot. I had to keep reading to find out what really happened\u2026 and what it might mean for Claire and Luke. If you like romantic suspense, you will love THE INN AT OCEAN\u2019S EDGE. Great book.

I was stumped up until I was well past the halfway mark.

It left some threads open to interpretation and/or continuation for the next book. Inspirational, emotional at times and edge of your seat suspense. A tiny bit of christianity but not overwhelming.

After reading Colleen Coble\u2019s Hope Beach series, was delighted to receive an ARC of THE INN AT OCEAN\u2019S EDGE  (Sunset Cove #1).  This is one intriguing and complex multi-layered mystery suspense page-turner thriller! Coble is at the \"top of her game\" with this new and exciting series of lies, dark family secrets, murder, and conspiracy. The story opens  with a brief encounter from 1989 with a scared little girl in the forest, near the cliffs and the sea, as the branches around her hold scary shadows. She hears a woman\u2019s voice, sees a scarf, and an angry man doing bad things, and she has to escape . . . he is after her and then all goes black.We jump to the present on the coastal shore of Maine with a stunning ocean front five story Hotel Tourmaline in a remote area, to the northeast of Schoodic Peninsula, on the island of Folly Shoals sitting atop its pink-granite cliffs. Claire Dellamare,  twenty-nine from Boston, has been on the road for five and a half hours plus a ferry ride from Summer Harbor to reach the rocky shore. As she emerged from her white Mercedes, as she looks up at the hotel, she gets an uneasy shiver down her spine. She is here on business,  to meet her millionaire dad, Harry Dellamare, coming to help with the upcoming merger. She is greeted by Jenny, the clerk, an attractive blonde in her thirties as she hands her the keys to the penthouse. Her dad is surprised to see her as he was not expecting her. However, something weird  is happening, as she cannot breathe\u2014she is having a panic attack, or could it be a heart attack? She has to get out of here. She runs out of the hotel to the ocean front to get her breath, thinking the sea would calm her. In the meantime, Luke Rocco  is on a boat headed towards Sunset Cove on the south side of the island with his sister Megan. He joined the coast guard years ago and loves it; however, presently Megan informs him she is taking a job in Oregon. He couldn\u2019t much blame her since he left three years earlier as she was stuck with the family cranberry farm, which has been in their family for many years. Someone would have to pick up the slack, and Luke was not thrilled at the prospects of having to work with their father nor coming back to this small remote town he spent his life trying to escape. Their dad was not a nice man and had gotten worse since his stroke.They never have forgotten  their mom\u2019s disappearance twenty-five years ago. Being the island was so remote, unfortunately it still remained a mystery.Gorgeous Claire meets Luke and Megan, as they are trying to rescue an orca and they do not get off to a good start, first with the panic attack and she jumps to the wrong conclusion when Luke was only trying to rescue the orca. She happens to be a volunteer for the organization. The love of the sea, bonds them instantly. When Luke learns  of her name, he recalls back in the 90\u2019s when Claire went missing a year out in the forest. However, Claire does not remember and knows about going missing as a child. No wonder she is upset--has she been here before, and her parents had never told her? She had been five when she was found and she has no memory of the event. Maybe her parents will have the answers. As far as she was concerned this was her first visit here. Had she been lied to her entire life? If she had been kidnapped, why did they hold her for a year and what was she doing during this time? If things could not  get any worse there are two people struggling at the edge of the cliff and she witnesses a murder, as a man just threw a woman over the cliff. The woman is Jenny Bennett she just met when she checked into the hotel. Now she recalls the face of the hunter, from her nightmares, only this time there was no fox attached to his belt. However, when the police arrive they see no body. She knows she did not imagine the scene. What did Jenny know?Luke begins to wonder  if Claire may possibly know something about his own mom\u2019s disappearance. However she would only have been four years old at the time. His mother disappeared the same night Claire was taken and was never found. Did Luke\u2019s dad have something to do with his mother\u2019s disappearance and how are the two connected? She discovers her parents were at the hotel when she was four and had a birthday party in the garden and now she is desperate to remember the events leading up to her abduction and why she cannot remember. Appears she was returned to the hotel with a note. No one ever found out where she was the entire time she was missing. Her parents were married at the hotel and came back every year for their daughter\u2019s birthday; that is until she went missing. In addition, her mom seems worried about something and she feels her dad is hiding something critical.Claire teams up with Luke  as they desperately attempt to find the missing pieces of how she can be linked to his mother\u2019s disappearance since they were on the same day. Victoria Rocco the co-owner of Rocco Cranberries went missing on her customary evening walk and never returned. She did not get as much attention, since searchers were looking for the young girl. Luke was only a kid himself at the time. When an anonymous letter  is sent to the Sheriff stating they should investigate Claire for Jenny\u2019s murder, postmarked the day before the Dellamares arrived and found Jenny\u2019s prints on the envelope. The Sheriff finds it odd Claire claimed Jenny was shoved off a cliff and days later just happens to be the one to find her out at Dead Man\u2019s Cove. After all she had only been gone fifteen minutes from the hotel when it occurred.At the Fisherman\u2019s Inn  there is another plot brewing, a blueberry farm and more dark family secrets. When more bodies turn up and one happens to be a four year old girl who had blond hair \u2013 was there a serial killer out there years ago and now he is back? The locket was found which held a picture of her parents with her initials on the back. There could not possibly be two of her? What about the bones of a woman? Could this be Luke and Megan\u2019s mom? Claire has been attacked  several times and this time he takes her drawing of the person she thinks may be the murderer. What if she is not a Dellamare? Someone thinks she may be able to identify him and she is in danger. However they find no evidence of a breakin. Her life is falling apart. She needs God\u2019s help and Luke's\u2014she needs to find solace on the water. THE INN AT OCEAN'S EDGE is one intense read, as had to stay up until 4 am to finish, as dying to know the identity of the murderer and how these three families are linked together in this complex conspiracy. Wow, Coleen Coble delivers a \"top-shelf\" mystery crime thriller with light romance suspense\u2014strongly reminding me of Terri Blackstock (a favorite), with Christian faith themes. Am also reminded of another favorite author, Mary Alice Monroe with the strong connection to the sea creatures, rescue, environment, and its relation to human family bonds and dynamics. Fans of Linda Huber's The Cold Cold Sea and Christina Dodd\u2019s Virtual Falls series, will enjoy this mix of suspense, romance, and mystery. As mentioned in the letter from the author, this is indeed, a deeper and more complex story than any she has written previously and YES, Colleen, you have mastered it-brilliantly written. What an engaging read! I am also a sucker for novels surrounding coastal hotels and inns since have been in the business for a number of years\u2026.always an intriguing setting.A fabulous front cover  drawing you into this family mystery.

But the mystery behind the story line was so intriguing, I just couldn't put it down. And so, that's how my husband found me when he got home late that night...curled up with Coble's book and an iced tea for company!Ocean's Edge definitely did not disappoint this reviewer! I was so caught up in the events of the book, I found myself quickly turning the pages, as if I could speed up my reading any faster. Mystery and suspense followed me throughout every page, and I found myself trying to solve the case before the characters in the story did!

There were around three or four different problems that had to be sorted throughout the book in order for the reader to figure out what had happened in the past and what was happening in the present. It was great! I figured out a couple parts of the \u201cmystery equation\u201d, but the author was able to surprise me with another couple of twists I didn\u2019t see coming.I really enjoyed reading The Inn at Ocean\u2019s Edge and read it very quickly because I didn\u2019t want to put the book down! I\u2019m so happy that it is the first in the Sunset Cove series.I received a complimentary copy of this book from BookLook Bloggers in exchange for my honest review.You can read this review on my blog at: https://brittreadsfiction.wordpress.c..."}, {"userName": "Sadie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7375386-sadie", "userReview": "This was the first time I've read a book by Colleen Coble. I read it for a book club, and I was happy about stepping outside my normal reading parameters. But, unfortunately, it wasn't as great as I had hoped. The story was interesting, and it made me want to keep reading (which is a good thing!). Overall, though, I thought the story was too outrageous. I felt like I was watching a soap opera. I mean, a hidden kidnapping wasn't enough? Then two dead bodies? Then a secret family? Then a secret twin sister? Then a secret twin sister with a life-threatening disease who couldn't find a bone marrow match? THEN a baby whale saves the day? Nah, just not my cup of tea. Maybe I'll try another one of Coble's books and see if I feel differently."}, {"userName": "Carrie Schmidt (Reading is My SuperPower)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6084197-carrie-schmidt-reading-is-my-superpower", "userReview": "Whew!

The story pulled me in from the first chapter. It was intriguing and filled with a lot of mystery, twists and turns. I did figure out the mysteries and also the villain, but not the villain's motive. Even though I did figure out what is going on, it didn't take away the suspense for me, since the truths were revealed shortly after I figured something out.I enjoyed both Luke and Claire's characters, though by the middle to end, Luke seemed to be more of a supporting character than the main character. The focus felt more to be on Claire and Kate by the end.The romance between Luke and Claire felt sweet and not the insta-love (saying I love you within a week of meeting etc) that some suspense books contain.I loved the short chapters. This enabled me to read a chapter in between caring for a baby, working and other responsibilities. I also enjoyed the scenes with the Orca.Recommended to fans of romantic suspense, and authors of Lynette Eason, Terri Blackstock, Susan May Warren, Irene Hannon and Danni Pettrey."}, {"userName": "norcalgal", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34406765-norcalgal", "userReview": "WARNING - SPOILERS are in this review!!!The plot of \"The Inn at Ocean's Edge\" was fairly preposterous - but it still worked for me, up to a point. The story was a little slow to develop, but once the main plot unfolded, the action moved along at a nice clip.The characters were a little flat and one-dimensional, though. I never connected with Claire or Luke. Their romance could have been better developed, but was still OK. Yes, there was some insta-love, but it was not as egregious as in some other books I've read.Kate was probably my favorite character. She seemed the most \"real\" and had the most personality. What wasn't \"real\" were the reactions of Claire's family to the many attempts on her life. The reaction from Claire's mom, dad and grandparents was fairly muted to my mind. You'd think a family with the wealth, privilege and connections they had would have gone absolutely bonkers at the many attempts and done everything on earth to bring the culprit to bear. But, besides urging Claire to leave, I thought their reaction was too low-key as to be believed. I also had to wonder if they knew - and if they did, why they didn't care that the local sheriff wanted to pin Jenny's murder on their beloved family member. Would powerful people really allow a local two-bit sheriff to railroad a beloved family member into accusations of murder?! The whole Dellamare clan was so bizarre.But speaking of unreal characters, there were two people whom I felt were too unbelievable to be believed (sorry for the bad syntax). First, was Claire's father. OK, I get trying to help your wife recover from a devastating trauma, but taking one child to replace another?! And then you compound that by letting your wife believe the replacement is her daughter instead of exposing the truth that she was killed - wow, that requires a suspension of disbelief that I just don't have.But there was someone even worse - Mary! Not only does she inadvertently kill a child, she was too easily cajoled into giving away one of her children as recompense?! Say what?! Then, when she's reunited with the daughter she thought was lost to her, she's fairly blase when she learns that her brother may harm or even kill her long-lost daughter. This took the story into \"over the top\" territory.So far, my review contains a lot of negatives. However, I did like the cover art. I felt it was so hauntingly beautiful, and matched the atmospherics of the novel perfectly. However, the novel as a romantic suspense, did neither very well, but was merely adequate in both the romance and the suspense."}, {"userName": "Dana", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10184198-dana", "userReview": "This I felt was a mystery within a mystery.

This is a clean romance,, with lots of tenderness. I did like some of the character, such as Luke, Megan, Kate, and Claire, and her grandmother , who gave spiritual advice.. There were also nasty characters, some I was surprised by the level of greed, and selfishness, where they turn on their own. I had,figured out the,pieces to all the murders, but it did not,matter, because. the,story kept you interested until the final page. I loved the wring style, but it is not a speedy book. You cannot just zip through it. There are lots of subtle clues. I cannot tell you why I did not go five,stars without ruining the story. I'll just say I was very upset reading the way some people are so callous about the innocent. plus the police were so jaded, they could not find their way out of a paper bag. I like when the people that are in charge act like they have,some idea what they are about. It was so obvious that Claire was in mortal danger, yet they did nothing.

The action gripped me from start to finish. It was one of those books that just had me asking questions all the way through it. and thankfully, I had answers by the end of the novel.Twenty five years before the story opens, Luke and Meg's mother had disappeared. At the very same time, four year old Claire had wandered away from her birthday party, and was not seen again until she came walking out of the woods one year later. Where had she been for a whole year?Fast forward to the start of the novel, twenty nine year old Claire travels to a hotel to meet her father Harry, to help him close a business deal. Claire immediately recognises the hotel from her birthday party twenty five years earlier. She had previously remembered nothing of that missing year, but now it is starting to come back to her.Luke and Meg rescue a young injured Orca whale, and it is on the beach that Claire first meets them. Claire is something of an expert on Orca whales, and offers her advice. Luke and Meg recognise Claire as the little girl who disappeared twenty five years ago, when they hear her name.Luke and Meg want to find out what happened to their mother. They are convinced that it must have had something to do with four year old Claire's disappearance. Together the three of them try to find out the truth of the twenty five year old mystery.The Inn At Oceans Edge was an amazing book that I just had to keep reading. As more of the events of twenty five years earlier were uncovered, so more questions were raised, as well as my heart rate, and I was unable to put the novel down.There was an intricate plot, but it was easy to follow, as it was revealed bit by bit. And no lose ends were left at the end of the book. Colleen Coble used pathetic fallacy, as the action was mirrored at one stage, by the increasingly stormy weather.The characters were all realistically drawn, and the main ones were all very likeable. I particularly enjoyed the interaction between Luke and Claire, and enjoyed watching their friendship develop.The main characters were all godly, turning to God in times of trouble, as well as following His principles for their lives. Colleen Coble showed that money did not necessarily enhance people's lives. What mattered most, was being kind to others. Claire's character had led a privileged life, but yet she was very down to earth, and kind and gentle to everyone she met.The truth was a main theme of the novel. Sometimes people do bad things, for what they perceive to be the right reason. But it is far better to know the truth, no matter how awful, than to live a lie.The theme of family ran throughout the novel. Some characters were searching for family members. Luke and Meg were searching for their mother. Family could be seen even in the little Orca whale, as Luke and Claire were searching to return him to his family group. This search could be seen as a microcosm for the whole novel. The interaction and kindness of Luke and Claire towards the little Orca whale was very touching, showing that their godly values extended to all God's creatures. The most important family to belong to, is God's family, and this clearly came through in the novel.I really enjoyed The Inn At Oceans Edge, and was blessed to receive a copy. It was a Christian mystery novel, with lots of twists and turns, and I can highly recommend it. I am eagerly awaiting book number two in the series."}, {"userName": "Kelly Roll", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1154966-kelly-roll", "userReview": "Unfortunately this book did not work for me. This does not mean that it will not work for you. Many people did enjoy the story and you could be among them.Some of the problems I had with the book ranged from mildly annoying such as stilted dialogue in which one character will basically parrot back the exact phrase another character has used such as \u201cyou should have called an Orca rescue organization\u201d \u201cWe were going to call an Orca rescue organization.\u201dThen I began to be pulled out of the story due to actions I felt were unrealistic. In one scene early on Claire has been missing for hours and when she returns she is quite disheveled, her dress is stained and torn, her hair is a mess . She goes up to her mother's room .Her mother chides her for looking like a mess and then finally asks if she is okay. Most people would have immediately asked about the other person's well being, not comment on their appearance. There should have been a sense that her parents were worried and relieved when Claire shows up. This is especially true because they had lived through Claire\u2019s kidnapping as a young child.I also had difficulty buying some of the action in the book - Claire is a suspect in a murder investigation because someone sent an anonymous letter but the Sheriff asks Claire's new beau to question her discretely (cause police departments always ask the would be boyfriend to do this) with nary a nod to actual background checks. I understand why she might be questioned but not why she would be a serious murder suspect.Also, and this was a big pill for me to swallow, why would her parents ever have agreed to have a business meeting at the hotel that had caused so much emotional grief , so much so that Claire\u2019s mother had to be institutionalized?All of this I could overlook if I was invested in my heroine but Claire falls flat for me and in some cases I don't really like her. She is supposed to be a professional business woman and yet she wears flirty little dresses trying to close a business deal. No thank you, please don't perpetuate the stereotype of women using their \"feminine wiles\" to accomplish things.Most of the other characters were also fairly despicable as well so I had no real reason to be engaged in the story and I\u2019m not sure why I persevered in reading it.I also found the suspense part of my romantic suspense novel to be lacking. Claire is attacked once, interesting, Claire is attacked three times, I began to yawn. The most damage she seems to sustain is a bump on the head and some bruising which did not prevent her from wearing the aforementioned flirty red dress. Sorry, I never felt much concern for her and kept thinking that the would be killer was probably the most inept character ever. We do discover later on why he didn't kill her outright the first time but this did nothing to convince me that the story shouldn't have been more suspenseful earlier on. To be frank it reminded me of a scooby doo episode \"why if it weren't for Claire and her meddling friends...I would have gotten away with it\". It was also quite evident to me early on who the killer was as well as the relationship between Claire and Kate."}, {"userName": "Kathleen (Kat) Smith", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4328680-kathleen-kat-smith", "userReview": "Who doesn't love a great mystery? I know I've been quite a fan in recent years and was pleasantly surprised to see that Colleen Coble has taken that challenge on in her latest Sunset Cove series with the introduction of The Inn at Ocean's Edge. Be prepared to have pen and paper ready in attempts to solve the puzzle before you get to the end. I was completely unprepared for how this one would wind up and thankfully I am not a real police detective. When Claire Dellamare arrives in at the Hotel Tourmaline on the island of Folly Shoals, Maine she doesn't understand why she feels pulled into a sense of panic and fear she can't explain. Hoping to help her father seal the merger between her family's aviation company and another one lucrative one, she knows she might just be the missing piece to help the two firms unite. But when Claire discovers that she went missing for over a year as a child without any knowledge, she begins to wonder what else her parents have been hiding. Luke Rocco hadn't meant to say anything to Claire when she wandered onto the beach accusing him and his sister Meg of capturing a baby Orca, but he believes she may have information that would help them find his mother who went missing at the same time Claire did. Even though he works for the Coast Guard, he has a hard time convincing Claire his intentions to save the baby Orca are honorable. He had hoped that meeting with Claire now 17 years later might help him discover what really happened to his mother the night she went on her walks and never came back. One thing is certain, someone else wants to ensure that neither of them find out the truth about what happened that night 17 years ago and will stop at nothing to keep those secrets dead and buried. I received The Inn at Ocean's Edge by Colleen Coble compliments of Thomas Nelson Publishers and Litfuse Publicity for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review and the opinions are strictly my own. I can't wait to see where this series will go and reminds me of her Rock Harbor series. A lot of suspense, mystery and of course the added element of unexpected romance are the perfect blend for a winning novel in my opinion. I don't want to give too much away but trust me if you love a great criminal mystery novel, pick this one up. Set in Maine, you get a sense of the mystery that comes from being near the ocean and using that as a backdrop for the story is truly brilliant. I give this one a 5 out of 5 stars and look forward to seeing how it all plays out through this series. I hope we see more of Luke and Claire in future novels.

I thought the author did a nice job of showing the turmoil that lies and deceptions can create in a family when the truth is withheld or ignored. The suspense built with each event to a thrilling climax. The only negative I have is that some of the events that take place in chapters 39 and 40 were not realistic in my opinion. I don\u2019t want to be specific so I don\u2019t spoil what happens.
