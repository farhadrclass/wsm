Levar Burton's narration was an excellent fit for the material, as he was both warm and engaging, and he often successfully modulated his delivery to indicate when the author was citing jazz luminaries, including Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, and others. Also, the format allowed for snippets of music to be included at various opportune moments, which was quite pleasant."}, {"userName": "Nick", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/964406-nick", "userReview": "Much more than a coffee-table book, this history of America's music accompanies the Ken Burns TV documentary series of the same name and even higher quality. There is so much to read and see, but of course nothing to hear, is this immaculately researched and presented story. For my liking there is too much emphasis on the early pioneers and not enough detail on the hundreds of stars who currently take the form in a myriad of directions. The same criticism is true of the documentary. However, this book does provide great background on how the form came to be and its origins."}, {"userName": "Pedro Dullius", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31617847-pedro-dullius", "userReview": "Livro excelente!

While it is certainly a history of jazz it also works more or less as a history of race relations since the beginning of the 20th century. I'm so glad authors Geoffrey C. Ward and Ken Burns decided not to eschew the rough parts of our history and instead weave them into the fabric of this truly original music. The originality of jazz is that it takes different influences from so many different parts of the world and sort of mixed them together to make this music. The details and research are there and it shows. Surely the authors have their favorites (sometimes I feel this is a history of Armstrong and Ellington as much as it is jazz). My only real knock on the book is that the authors further the belief that jazz died once Coletrane passed away. Once Coletrane is gone, jazz is dead or at least the book sort of ends there. There are a few obligatory notes about jazz post Coltrane but more than one source is cited as saying that avant garde killed jazz which is where Coltrane was going at the end of his time here. Well I don't really believe that and would have loved to read about some of my heroes like Ayler, Graves, Brotzmann, Art Ensemble Of Chicago, John Zorn, etc. There are brief mentions here and there but once the 70's hit the authors are pretty much done. I don't really feel the avant garde killed jazz as much as rock and the subsequent \"fusion\" jazz movement. All art forms need the avant garde in order to further the craft along and then when musicians start to take the elements of experimentation and make something slightly more listener friendly the bridging of the popular and experiment take a genre into new territories. Me and Ken Burns will never sit down to lunch, but if we did I am sure that would be a hot topic of discussion for us."}, {"userName": "Ken Moten", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4635205-ken-moten", "userReview": "In 2001 I watched Ken Burns' documentary on Jazz and I remember thinking I have to learn how to play the trumpet because Louis Armstrong is badass and I hope to get that book some day. Just a few ears later-I got the book. This was thickest and (one of) biggest book(s) I had at the time. Before I read a word of it I spent a few days simply looking at the pictures which there are a lot of. After awhile I started to read it and by two months I had read it. This book fill in a lot that the initial run of the documentary left out though annoyingly it also gets sketchy with the time-line at the end. Still this book was and still is a very good and detailed read up on the subject matter. I have long obliterated the cover to it and part of the border is exposed showing the cardboard (proof of how hard I initially loved this thing) but it is still intact and I do glance over it once in a blue moon. Don't where you would find this at now but if you wanted to know the history of Jazz in its hey-day this is a good book to check out."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8258745-michael", "userReview": "It has been a long time since I have thought about the music that I fell in love with as a teenager. At that time in my life I was absorbed with jazz, the listening to it, the playing of it, and the reading about it. As adulthood swept me into pursuits no so leisure oriented, tie for listening to music in a serious way was shrunken to almost nothing. When turning on the car radio, I generally opt for sugar-coated music that is easily forgotten. For to listen to jazz, one must bring ones whole attention to bear. this of course requires time, which for any modern man, is precious.This book renewed in me the awe and respect for jazz as an art form, as entertainment, and as part of my country's history, a reflection of its much broader march through time.

Respectable in size, come with a great deal of photos, and all the more exciting accompanied with the jazz music itself (I like to listen to the artists as I read about them) Though I can get the sense that the author is in favor of some artists than the others, he did make an effort to create equal grounds for each. After all, one can only do so much when writing a book about history, and not wanting to make it an encyclopedia. Still, It did its job guiding me on what and how to learn more specifically about jazz . All in all, a wonderful read.

Many books on jazz can be as difficult to follow as a bebop chord progression, but Ward\u2019s text is clear and well-written. Throughout the book, the development of the music is presented in the context of America\u2019s social, cultural, and political history. The volume is profusely illustrated with photographs from the PBS documentary.

It is well written, loaded with historical photographs, and as complete as possible for a book of its size. Pretty much the same things, both good and bad, that were said about the series can be said about the book.

Ward and Ken Burns vividly bring to life the story of the quintessential American music\u2014jazz. Born in the black community of turn-of-the-century New Orleans but played from the beginning by musicians of every color, jazz celebrates all Americans at their best.Here are the stories of the extraordinary men and women who made the music: Louis Armstrong, the fatherless waif whose unrivaled genius helped turn jazz into a soloist's art and influenced every singer, every instrumentalist who came after him; Duke Ellington, the pampered son of middle-class parents who turned a whole orchestra into his personal instrument, wrote nearly two thousand pieces for it, and captured more of American life than any other composer. Bix Beiderbecke, the doomed cornet prodigy who showed white musicians that they too could make an important contribution to the music; Benny Goodman, the immigrants' son who learned the clarinet to help feed his family, but who grew up to teach a whole country how to dance; Billie Holiday, whose distinctive style routinely transformed mediocre music into great art; Charlie Parker, who helped lead a musical revolution, only to destroy himself at thirty-four; and Miles Davis, whose search for fresh ways to sound made him the most influential jazz musician of his generation, and then led him to abandon jazz altogether. Buddy Bolden, Jelly Roll Morton, Dizzy Gillespie, Art Tatum, Count Basie, Dave Brubeck, Artie Shaw, and Ella Fitzgerald are all here; so are Sidney Bechet, Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, and a host of others.But Jazz is more than mere biography. The history of the music echoes the history of twentieth-century America. Jazz provided the background for the giddy era that F. Scott Fitzgerald called the Jazz Age. The irresistible pulse of big-band swing lifted the spirits and boosted American morale during the Great Depression and World War II. The virtuosic, demanding style called bebop mirrored the stepped-up pace and dislocation that came with peace. During the Cold War era, jazz served as a propaganda weapon\u2014and forged links with the burgeoning counterculture. The story of jazz encompasses the story of American courtship and show business; the epic growth of great cities\u2014New Orleans and Chicago, Kansas City and New York\u2014and the struggle for civil rights and simple justice that continues into the new millennium.Visually stunning, with more than five hundred photographs, some never before published, this book, like the music it chronicles, is an exploration\u2014and a celebration\u2014of the American experiment.From the Hardcover edition.", "title": "Jazz: A History of America's Music", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/178100.Jazz", "average": 4.1, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348341668l/178100.jpg", "reviews": 28, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/44048.Geoffrey_C_Ward", "name": "Geoffrey C.
