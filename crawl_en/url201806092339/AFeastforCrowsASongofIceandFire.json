Behold: the Readers of A Feast for Crows: Angry, Sullen, Vengeful! silly readers. i'm not sure i've ever read such a collection of resentful reviews for one book. one reviewer just decided to repeat the same phrase over and over and over again (sorry Joel, had to say it). another decided to note that \"...kids are inherently boring. Kids aren\u2019t clever...\" er, wtf? sigh. i suppose i can understand the backlash. Martin took a long-assed time to put this out into the world and then - WHAT THE HELL - reader favorites Tyrion & Jon Snow & Daenerys have dropped off of this book's radar. but i am also perplexed - despite the loss of these wonderful creations, this is an excellent and challenging novel. come on readers, grow a pair! personally, i savored this book from beginning to end. the intricate plot, the propulsive narrative, the intelligent world-building, and most importantly the depth of characterization that were all hallmarks of prior volumes are still in place and undiminished in this installment. one of the things that is often overlooked about Martin is that he is a brilliant writer of quality prose. his descriptions are not just lavish, they are often quite beautiful. he has an expert grasp of language; the man knows how to create imagery that is by turns stark, subtly threatening, strangely enchanting, morbid, nostalgic, and ambiguous. the only reason the novel does not earn a top rating from me (but really, who cares anyway) is because of an unfortunately heavy reliance on repetition - mainly of key phrases and dream imagery. still, this novel should stand tall as an excellent continuation of this amazing series.first and foremost, A Feast for Crows is A Story of the Women of Westeros. because this is set in a medieval land that has very little wish fulfillment in terms of rectifying gender imbalance, it is fated by its own nature to be an unsettling and unfufilling narrative.CONSTANT SPOILERS FOLLOWThe Queen Regent. Cersei Lannister is this series' chief villain and so it was with much anticipation that i approached her POV chapters. they did not disappoint. quite unlike the POV chapters from her formerly villainous twin Jaime, there is not much redemption coming Cersei's way. she's such a fuckin bitch, as the saying goes. she remains cold, grasping, machiavellian, murderous, and extremely petty. she is also incredibly entertaining: a villain in the Grand Old Style, full of swallowed rage and sweetly-uttered put-downs and viciously cruel schemes. she takes to drink and she lets a fellow viper into her bed (which also allows Martin to indulge in an enjoyably laugh out-loud lesbionic interlude). she makes a classic mistake in allowing fanatics to arm themselves. in the end, she literally outsmarts herself, and is the victim of her own foul trap. best of all, she is going crazy! her dreams haunt her, dreams of her death and the deaths of her children. much of her villainous nature is explained by these dreams...what mother wouldn't stop at anything to protect her children? and so Cersei doesn't stop at anything.but what i mainly took away from her chapters were two important lessons that i learned, oh, years ago, probably in my various college Gender Studies classes. first: a woman in power within a patriarchal structure is a woman in constant battle with her peers. she will not receive the automatic respect granted to men; she will have to \"earn it\", whatever that even means. she will be constantly reminded that her job is actually to marry and to bear children, and that her position of authority is somehow unnatural, against the natural order of things. i despised Cersei, but i also despised those around her who did not give her the automatic respect a man would have in her position. i appreciate that Martin made this inequity crystal clear: he is against Cersei (of course he is - she's the villain) but he also gives the challenges she faces in her new position a rather timeless quality. gender inequity is timeless.and the second lesson: a woman who gains power within a patriarchal system by mirroring the gender essentialism that supports that system has, sadly, sublimated that structure as natural and right - and will therefore enact that chauvinism. Women's Studies 101, folks. Cersei does not \"challenge gender imbalance\" - she supports it. her interior monologues are full of the same bullshit as any sexist dumbass. she despises \"weakness\" in men. she condemns \"slutty\" behavior while indulging in it herself. she uses classic chauvinistic tactics to bring down a rival and even-more-classic male brutality to destroy men and women alike. as i mentioned...she's a fuckin bitch! but her character is a fascinating one to contemplate.The Sand Snakes and The Dorne Princess. i suppose the chapters set in Dorne could contribute to many readers' disengagement with this novel. oh, whatever. i love Dorne! Dorne is the ugly stepchild of Westeros: matrilineal and distantly threatening, with a great big chip on its shoulder. but what a place it is: aggressive and volatile, sure, but also a land where women are automatically given the same respect as men, where a princess is the natural heir to the throne, where bastards are not automatically disrespected. the brief glimpses of the Sand Snakes, despite their inability to start the war they craved, were compelling in how differentiated they were in their various proposals to begin battle. and i also appreciated how fallible Arianne Martell turned out to be: a girl unused to schemes but still scheming away, a seductress who fell in love, a woman loyal to her friends and disinterested in cruelty, an heiress and misguided leader-to-be, one whose time in the limelight approaches.Sansa/Alayne and Arya/Cat. sometimes a girl has to literally convince herself that she is someone else, simply to survive. sometimes a girl has to forget the parts of her that make her herself, in order to achieve her goals. of course in one case, this is a girl who has lived her life as a pathos-ridden pawn. in the other case, we have a girl who is slowly losing her humanity as she becomes a kind of living weapon. eh, so what? they both have my full support. go Sansa & Arya, go! survive this series, you can do it!Catelyn/Stoneheart. and sometimes a woman fails. to accomplish her goals, to protect her loved ones, to save her children. i imagine that some women can get past this and can go on to define themselves anew. and other women cannot, or do not. they swallow their bitterness but do not forget: it becomes their fuel, their purpose for being. it can turn a heart to stone. and, um, it probably doesn't help having your throat slashed at your brother's wedding and then being revived as a monstrous quasi-zombie. and so Catelyn becomes a dread avenger, and not a pretty one. she is a killer without regard to reason or even justice, and she turns Dondarrion's Merry Men into a grim and bloodthirsty cabal. i never thought i'd see Thoros be so sad, so lost. i never thought Lemoncloak could be such an uncaring asshole. i never thought Catelyn would hang an innocent woman or a mere lad. well, i suppose that's what can happen. so i know that Brienne survives, that's obvious. but if Podric Payne dies, i'm coming after you, George Martin!The Maid of Tarth. i saved one of my favorite characters of the series for last. i don't think Brienne is a lot of readers' favorite; i assume they find her constant integrity and her equally constant naivete, repetitiousness, and lack of imagination to be tedious. but that's not how i feel! i loved her from beginning to (probably not her) end. there is such genuine realism to her loyal, awkward, lovelorn character. she is a warrior woman, but this means nothing in male-dominated Westeros except constant and automatic disrespect. she is, i suppose, \"physically unattractive\" and is constantly reminded of that by nearly every person she meets. she is always Doing The Right Thing; that integrity causes her to be disrespected even more, and it often means nothing to the people around her. well it means a lot to me! her quest may have been aimless, but it was also useful in illustrating the true and awful tragedy of war: the lives lost, the tormented survivors, the bleak landscapes, the sense of a world turned dark and bloody and soulless - a world without meaning. seeing such a brave person travel through this blighted landscape and continuously, stubbornly, mulishly trying to do good was hard to read - but it was also what i really needed in order to truly connect with this novel: a hero, tried and true. her two fight scenes, vanquishing members of the appalling Brave Companions, were awesome. what a brave lady and what a unique addition to the fantasy genre's Hero Archetype. i love her. as i loved this book.now on to the next one!"}, {"userName": "j", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2863914-j", "userReview": "A highborn maid of three-and-ten, with a fair face and auburn hair.

A Song of Ice and Fire began with the publication of A Game of Thrones in 1996. Thrones introduced us to the land of Westeros, a continent the size of South America but suspiciously similar to medieval England. We followed a handful of characters representing various factions of the Seven Kingdoms, squabbling for the right to sit upon the Iron Throne. Its grittiness, tactility, fully-realized characters, and high stakes (a major character loses a head) gave it a cult following. Two years after Thrones, A Clash of Kings was published. It told the story of \u201cthe War of the Five Kings.\u201d Though it started slowly, it built to a fine ending, which included the shocking loss of Winterfell (home to many of our main characters) and the epic Battle of the Blackwater. A phenomenon had started. Like clockwork, the third novel in the cycle, A Storm of Swords came two years after Kings. It was the biggest book so far, and easily the best. It featured all the hallmarks we\u2019d come to expect from author George R.R. Martin \u2013 swordfights, detailed descriptions of food, casual misogyny, laughably crude sex scenes, shocking twists, major character deaths, and a humdinger of a cliffhanger \u2013 but those elements were heightened. There are set pieces in Swords that are simply classic (see, e.g., \u201cthe Red Wedding\u201d). At the end of Swords, the fate of several major characters \u2013 beloved characters \u2013 dangled in the wind. Readers thirsted for the next installment. They began their wait. And then crickets. Nothing for five years. After five years, we were given the present installment: A Feast for Crows. By this time, it was nearly impossible for any book to live up to the expectations of Swords. On this level, at least, Crows did not disappoint. It certainly met the expectation that it could not meet expectations. As the old saying goes, the only thing worse than a bad meal is a small bad meal. Not only did Crows fail to meet the challenge of Swords, it was over too quickly. When readers got to the last page, they were left to wonder, this is it?. Martin, you see, had allowed the manuscript for Crows to get so long, he decided to cut the thing in half. As he explained in a now-infamous postscript, Martin decided to split the book geographically, rather than chronologically. That meant that many of the best characters did not appear; none of the cliffhangers from Swords were resolved; and we were left to follow the dubious quests of various secondary personages. To make matters worse, Martin tentatively promised the next volume, A Dance With Dragons, would be published the next year. That postscript was written in 2005. Six years later, A Dance With Dragons was finally released. Thus, it is a fortuitous time to review Crows. It is a much-maligned book, buffeted by two competing elements: the long wait before the book was published, and the longer wait after. In other words, the book has suffered critically because it took so long to come out and did not satisfy the pent-up demand. It also suffered because it did nothing to alleviate the long wait for Dragons. Almost all agree that Crows is the weakest volume in A Song of Ice and Fire. Beyond that, opinions are split. Some people hate it with the light of a thousand suns. Some people love it like a pug dressed in a tuxedo. Others acknowledge its weakness while admitting that a subpar steak is still a steak. The length of time it takes Martin to churn out his opuses creates some high passion amongst his fans. That passion, combined with the internet and thousands of basements belonging to thousands of moms has created a great deal of hyperbolic ire directed towards Martin. While this criticism is a minority report, it is loud, and has colored the merits of Crows. I am immune to this misplaced anger. I am a latecomer to Martin\u2019s work; accordingly, when I started reading Thrones, four books had already been published, with a confirmed release date for the fifth. I\u2019ve never suffered the long withdrawals between books that the early adopters have had to overcome. Due to this tardiness, I feel like I can judge Crows based on its literary qualities, rather than its late arrival onto the Ice and Fire firmament. Unfortunately, the literary qualities of Crows are in short supply. Most of Crows\u2019 problems stem from Martin\u2019s decision to divide the story by geography, and focus mainly on the action in Westeros that takes place south of the Wall. That means that the dwarf, Tyrion Lannister, Martin\u2019s greatest creation, is missing. So are Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen. Not only are you losing fantastic, multidimensional characters with whom we\u2019ve traveled for hundreds and thousands of pages, you lose the heart of the story. As far as I can tell (and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be wrong), Martin\u2019s endgame seems to point towards two events: the struggle at the Wall against the onslaught of the walking dead (the song of Ice); and Daenerys\u2019 struggle to reclaim the Iron Throne with the help of her dragons (the song of Fire). Neither of those crucial points get any play in Crows. Instead, it\u2019s 700 pages of B-side.The viewpoint characters in Crows (Martin\u2019s story is told in the third-person limited, with chapters that alternate points-of-view among various characters) are mostly new to the spotlight. Jaime Lannister, Samwell Tarly, Arya Stark and Sansa Stark are the only returning viewpoint characters. The other viewpoints go to Queen Cersei, Aeron, Asha, and Victarion Greyjoy, Areo Hotah, Brienne of Tarth, Aerys Oakheart, and Arianne Martell. Some of these characters are brand new. Some have been barely mentioned. Most of them are confusingly named (it gets a bit tough keeping Arya, Areo, Aeron, Aerys and Arianne apart, at least for me; unfortunately, I\u2019m not able to devote my entire life to these books). With some exceptions, their stories do not rise to the level of interest or intensity as the plotlines of Martin\u2019s earlier books. The bulk of this book, nearly a quarter of the pages, belongs to Cersei. Given space to develop her character, Martin is his usual strong self. Earlier in the series, Cersei was a terrifying, enigmatic peripheral character. In Thrones, she showed her smarts, and her cruelty, by getting the drop on Eddard Stark (admittedly not the sharpest tool in the shed). After the death of her son, King Joffrey, in Swords, Cersei\u2019s transformation began. She became more guarded, paranoid, and megalomaniacal. Her descent into madness is marked by her growing certainty that all her decisions are correct. The most interesting aspect of Crows is Cersei\u2019s long fall contrasted with the rise of a fanatical religious movement called the Faith. Cersei is also beneficiary of one of Martin's weird peripheral-characters, the the fallen maester Lord Qyburn. Like Dr. Frankenstein, Qyburn toils away in the dungeons, doing odd experiments on living subjects, the result of which, it is obvious to see, will be half-human, half-monster. (Unfortuntately, Cersei's chapters are disadvantaged by a subplot concerning Westeros' outstanding loans to the Bank of Braavos. All the talk of high finance and trade federations harkened uncomfortably to another famous fantasy/sci-fi epic that lost its way). Cersei\u2019s brother/lover, Jaime, has the second most page-time. His evolution from villain to hero takes a big leap forward, as we see him go from murderous sister-humper to a canny leader pushing back against the excesses of King\u2019s Landing. With Jaime\u2019s chapters, Martin is able to tie up a few loose ends still dangling after the War of the Five Kings (for example, the dragging siege at Riverrun is finally concluded). The balance of Crows is told in scattershot style through the ten remaining viewpoint characters. We barely hear from Sansa, which is fine with me. Still, it is nice to see that she is developing at least a semblance of wit. I have a major problem with her character, mainly because Martin portrays Sansa as a real child; that is, as someone who is uninteresting and dumb. The problem with kids as characters is that kids are inherently boring. Kids aren\u2019t clever, no matter what I see posted on Facebook. Only in a book or movie is a kid who can\u2019t tie his shoes crafty enough to turn his house into a living version of Mousetrap to foil a pair of robbers. So far, Sansa is realistic in the sense that she is dull, frightened, mistake-prone, and hollow. This also means she is a weak protagonist. In Crows, despite a limited appearance, she finally starts to learn some of the finer points of deception. Arya Stark is a more traditional fictional child. Despite her tender years, she performs great heroic feats. Her ever-growing darkness, however, makes her a joy to follow (I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if, at the end of A Song of Ice and Fire, we counted her among the bad guys). In Crows, Arya is exiled to Braavos. She doesn\u2019t do much of anything, and her chapters seem meant only to explore the islands of Braavos. This would\u2019ve been fine if Braavos was interesting. Instead, it\u2019s just Venice, right down to the swaggering, arrogant, hand-talking men-folk. Three characters, Areo, Arienne and Aerys, serve to give us entr\u00e9e into Dorne. The set up here \u2013 the machinations of Dorne against King\u2019s Landing \u2013 is obviously important. However, these chapters are rushed (and the Aerys chapters are so short and abrupt I have a hard time understanding their inclusion). The same goes for the chapters with the three Ironborn characters: Aeron, Asha, and Victarion. In perfunctory style, they are moved like chess pieces, put in place for further development down the road. The chapters following Brienne are like walking on a treadmill. She\u2019s given a lot of space to do things, but she never gets anywhere. Martin has her crisscrossing the ruins of a war-torn Westeros, searching for Sansa Stark. Of course, we know exactly where Sansa is; therefore, we know that Brienne is never going to find her. Also, for all her abilities, she is portrayed as a slow-thinker, a female Forrest Gump who\u2019s handy with a sword. Even if we didn't know where Sansa was hiding, we\u2019d have a pretty good idea that Brienne\u2019s plan to find her would fail (it literally consists of her wandering around, asking where Sansa has gone). These are structural problems. And forgivable, as long as the book\u2019s quality had been consistent. It\u2019s not. This is a poorly written book by Martin\u2019s standards. His descriptions seem tired. His writer\u2019s tics are more pronounced. The dialogue, which had been whip-smart and eminently quotable, is execrable. It is flat, repetitive (Jaime\u2019s \u201cI love you too, sweet sister\u201d is repeated on a loop), and filled with odd, obtrusive, never-before-used idioms. For some reason, the characters start referring to their uncles as nuncles, even though uncle had served just fine before. In one chapter, the insult \u201cstoatish\u201d is used two or three times (as far as I can tell, it means weasel-like) and then dropped like a bag of flaming poo.Despite taking five years to write, Crows feels like a first draft. There are brief glimmers displaying Martin\u2019s mastery of both his world and his writing. For instance, even though Brienne\u2019s dead-end quest is inert as a narrative, Martin\u2019s evocation of a war-weary Westeros is captivating, with its fresh graves, burnt-out homes, and outlaw-infested roads. Subpar writing can be saved by a propulsive plot or a great set piece. As I noted before, the plot grinds forward. Moreover, nothing exciting happens. Swordplay is kept to a minimum. There isn\u2019t a battle to be found (in a way, Martin\u2019s exhausted effort mirrors the tiredness of war-blasted Westeros). With the exception of Moby Dick, I try not to use the word \u201cboring\u201d in my reviews. Here, though, things get awfully close to the b-word. To be sure, there are a few saving graces. The first is the sex scenes. They are just awful, and bound to put a smile on your face. The high/lowlight is a lesbian sex scene between Cersei and Lady Taena that involves an unfortunate comparison of a women\u2019s nether regions to a swamp. It had me laughing my ass off. Martin is also able to add a few twists at the end, including a cliffhanger that leaves one character dangling by the neck. Here, unlike in Kings, a strong ending isn\u2019t enough to save the rest of the book. To the contrary, Martin should take lessons from M. Night Shyamalan: you can\u2019t rely so much on 11th hour shocks or uncertain character fates. At some point, A Song of Ice and Fire will be finished. Either Martin will complete the saga, or it will linger forever as a partially-completed near-great thing. When that time comes, it is very likely that the esteem for Crows will rise. It\u2019s faults will be less glaring; its virtues will seem more virtuous. Right now, though, I just want to move on to A Dance With Dragons and pretend Crows wasn\u2019t half as bad as I know it was."}, {"userName": "Madeline", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/111921-madeline", "userReview": "Hey everyone, George RR Martin here. I thought I'd take some time off from planning my intricate and complex storylines (spoiler alert: everyone has sex with everyone and then kills each other) to introduce A Feast for Crows, the long-awaited fourth installment in my epic fantasy series! You guys are in for a treat, this one is awesome.So the last book was quite a ride, huh? There was that craziness that was the Weddings of Death, Tyrion killed his father, , Jon Snow finally got cool and is now Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, Arya continued to be a tiny BAMF, Bran looked like he was finally moving towards a real plot, and Daenerys decided to temporarily shelve her whole unleash-the-dogs-of-war plan and be a queen for a while. Also I made Christmas come early for Madeline when I killed off Catelyn Stark, only to bring all her hopes and dreams crashing down when it turned out that Catelyn is a zombie now and will never die. Hee hee hee. Anyway, with all that cool stuff, you probably thought that this book was going to be made of awesome, what with all the fallout from the stuff I described above. And it will be, but unfortunately my attention to detail and complex storylines finally came back to bite me in the ass, and it turns out I couldn't devote an entire book to all the plots I started in the last book. So I divided them into two volumes, and saved all the cool people for Book Five. Want to read about Jon Snow, Daenerys, and Tyrion? Too fucking bad.Don't worry though, this means we get to meet lots of fun new characters, like Theon's crazy uncles and a lot of random people from Dorne. They each get just one chapter, of course, because they only exist so I can have a perspective to show all these events from (my changing single-character viewpoint structure has also begun to bite me in the ass, unfortunately) and you'll probably never see them again, but that's what makes it fun! It's not all bad, at least - Arya's still here, even though she's not doing much murdering or really much of anything. This is where Arya learns how to be more awesome, so she can wreck everyone's shit later - or maybe not, because in the last chapter we see her in, she's just gone blind. Is it temporary, or permanent? You'll just have to buy the next book and find out (maybe)! And hey, I gave you guys some Cersei chapters, finally. And yes, she's just as much of a psycho bitch as you always suspected. You're welcome. Also Jaime chapters - bet you didn't think he would turn out to be one of the only decent characters in the series, huh? (of course, if he's becoming one of the good guys, that means I'll probably murder him soon) And there are more Samwell Tarly chapters! Everyone loves reading about Sam, right? Guys? Guys? Where are you going? Don't worry, the next book will be all about Tyrion and Daenerys and Bran (look, it's going to pay off soon, I swear. Really guys, he's going to be interesting eventually.) and all the other cool characters that I totally ignored in this book and that you really wanted to read about. As for all the character-based cliffhangers I established in this book, will they be resolved in the next volume? Probably not! I am George RR Martin, and I demand your money and your tears!PS: Quit bitching at me to write faster. You'll get your books when I say you get them, and not a day sooner. Don't push me, or the next volume published will be titled A Siege of Tears and it'll be nothing but Jon Snow, Bran Stark, and Samwell Tarly sitting around and thinking about how inadequate they are. Do not test me on this, nerds."}, {"userName": "Justin", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/867629-justin", "userReview": "I'm not quite sure what happened, here.As others have mentioned, Martin slows the pace of the story down considerably in this fourth installment of A Song of Ice and Fire, ostensibly writing this as the first half of a two-book volume, with a 3-5 year production time on each. As such, the book is by necessity filled with unresolved storylines, AWOL main characters, and lengthy travelogues where nothing of importance happens. Of course, this draws the inevitable comparisons to another famous fantasy series that started strong and became a sluggish, irritating morass (something to do with wheels and time, as I recall). The pace isn't really the problem, here, though, as the story still stands on its own two legs. The problem is the writing.Though the first three books were extraordinarily well-written as a whole, one could never classify Martin's prose as elegant. In this book, he takes three steps backward for some reason, and sounds almost amateurish in some chapters. The book is filled with phrases and sentences that are awkward, clich\u00e9d, and sometimes downright hackneyed. Martin's prose may typically be spare and to the point, but I never audibly groaned while reading the first three books.One of the biggest problems with this is Martin's sudden inclusion of colloquialisms that, so far as I can tell, never existed in the books before this one. Coz's, nuncles, and valonqars abound, even though we've never read any character use these turns of phrase before, and be prepared to hear \"groats\" referenced multiple times in a single chapter. This doesn't only present a continuity problem, for those of us wondering why these dialect oddities are so suddenly commonplace... Martin seems to have run out of patience for phrasing things differently, so the exact same idiom often gets used ad nauseum. I was weary of these invented clich\u00e9s before I even truly understood what they meant.By now, fans of the series thus far are used to the disturbing ubiquity of rape in Martin's world, but even that loses what little subtlety it had in this book, with at least two characters being described as \"needing a hard raping\" (another example of redundancy in Martin's writing... did that expression really need to be used twice in one book?). The consensual sexuality devolves in this book, as well; Martin uses strange fixations and blunt-force descriptions (the comparison of female private parts to a \"swamp\" was the high point for me, as it were) which make them seem almost bizarre, and therefore a lot more gratuitous than they were in the first three books.I gave it two stars instead of one because the standout elements of this series are still evident in A Feast For Crows, despite Martin's apparent attempt to sabotage them with clumsy writing. The characters are multidimensional, unpredictable, and well-developed, and the overarching story is fascinating enough to keep me turning pages. However, I am genuinely concerned about the direction of this series, which has heretofore been my favorite fantasy series and often recommended to friends. I don't know what's going on with Martin's writing, but I truly hope the next book returns to the caliber of the first three. I would hate to have to do with this series what I do with Jordan's: recommend that people stop at Book 3 and pretend it's an open-ended trilogy. I'd much rather dismiss this one as \"the mediocre volume\" and go back to enjoying the series. Here's hoping."}, {"userName": "Melissa \u2665 Dog/Wolf Lover \u2665 Martin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin", "userReview": "The book was better than the first time around.

I smell my wolf, my smell her fur, almost as if she were still beside me. \"I don't smell anything,\" she said, to see what he would say.\n\n. . . and she leapt to meet his rush, both hands on her sword hilt. His headlong charge brought him right onto her point, and Oathkeeper punched through cloth and mail and leather and more cloth, deep into his bowels and out his back, rasping as it scraped along his spine. His axe fell from limp fingers, and the two of them slammed together, Brienne's face mashed up against the dog's head helm. She felt the cold wet metal against her cheek. Rain ran down the steel in rivers, and when the lightening flashed again she saw pain and fear and rank disbelief through the eye slits. \"Sapphires,\" she whispered at him, as she gave her blade a hard twist that made him shudder. His weight sagged heavily against her, and all at once it was a corpse that she embraced, there in the black rain. She stepped back and let him fall . . .\n *Old Review*I don't have any idea when I started this so I just set it to today. I do that a lot when I don't add books to my currently reading. I get anal having too many books on my currently reading. Anyway, I hate giving this a 3 star review but at some point I'm going to re-read it. I'm trying to listen to a lot of my chunkers on audio and mark my place in the book. Unfortunately, the narrator ruined it for me. I think he would be a great narrator for other books but not this one and that's just my opinion. When he was doing the voices they all sounded like whiny little boys or something. Do you think the evil Cersei sounds like that or the awesome Brienne or even Jaime? And he kept calling Brienne, Brain. Anyway, it pretty much ruined it for me. I did miss my fav characters but I'm fine reading about others. I love Brienne and Jaime. And Arya had some parts although she sounded like a whiny little boy. Ugh, it was bad I will just have to physically read this one day because the audio is just no :-("}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/94602-kelly", "userReview": "Dear George,How do you do this lovely May morning? I'm terribly sorry to bother you, but I really did think that I must in good conscience warn you of this problem I have. You see, I know many people who read these books and absolutely adore them. Legions of fans. I'm sure you know that. Really, the books are quite high quality and quite enjoyable and whatever you need to do to get them to stay at that quality, please do it.... within reason. It has come to our (the masses') attention that perhaps waiting three to four years between books is a bit excessive. Don't you think so?Now, more importantly than the principle of the thing... I've noticed some very unhealthy side effects from these gaps in between the books. Namely, some severe mental complexes that are resulting in a personal hostility towards you. I thought I had an obligation to warn you that I have heard of several imaginative plots that many of my fellow readers have dreamed up to get you to finish these books. All of them involve house arrest, most of them involve chaining you to your computer, a few involve terribly cruel things with assorted war instruments like those you brutally describe in your novels. I've heard a few terribly distressing things along the lines of, \"shoving a broadsword up his ass.\" I'm sure you can imagine the rest.Now while I don't think that people would employ such plans now, I do notice that these mental complexes seem to get worse over time. So... who knows in the future?Just thought you should know!So, toodle pip, hope that put you in the mood for writing.

There weren't any huge battle sequences or weddings filled with bloodshed, but rather a lot of plotting.This book contained two of my favorite characters, Arya and Sansa, but there weren't enough chapters about them to satisfy me. This one mainly followed Cersei and Jaime, along with quite a few side characters who we didn't see much of in the first three books. I'm really interested to see what happens in the next book, but I'm already anxious for book six because I need to know what's happening with Arya and Cersei.

That being said, it is still an extremely well-written story. I have no doubt that the new characters, places and events will serve to further the plot.While hearing Cersei's viewpoint was somewhat enlightening, it got tiresome. Cersei is as cold and cruel as Joffrey was. Being \"stuck\" in her mind was torture. She was constantly scheming and manipulating. Honestly, does this woman never stop? Just hearing it was exhausting.Arya and Sansa continue to do what they have to in order to survive. It is interesting to see how they evolve as their circumstances change. I would've liked to hear more about the Stark girls, but maybe next time.This book also introduced some new characters...and brought back some old ones. I'm still trying to wrap my mind around the back from the dead Catelyn Stark. She's definitely changed in more ways than one. Sometimes, things are better left alone. I'm struggling to accept this particular twist.Mostly, I was disappointed to find many of my favorite characters noticeably absent in this book. Daenerys is my favorite. I longed to hear about what was going on with her and her dragons. How is their journey going? Unfortunately, I didn't get that information.Similarly, Tyrion Lannister was nowhere to be found. As a character, he really grew on me. His disappearing act left me feeling a bit bereft. Like Daenerys, information on Tyrion was noticeably absent. I'm dying here!Like the last one, this one ends with a bit of an upheaval. Cersei finds herself in a bind and calls upon her knight in shining armor to save her. I'm hoping that she finally gets what she has coming, but I'll have to wait and see.Overall, I'm still very much addicted to this series. The writing is spectacular, as is the narration. I'm on to the next book. Based upon the title, I'm expecting to hear more from Daenerys and the dragons. This may have been my least favorite of the books so far, but it still blows most other books away."}, {"userName": "StoryTellerShannon", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6773727-storytellershannon", "userReview": "Whew, this is a tough book to review simply because it doesn't follow on the expectations of the readers after A STORM OF SWORDS. Now some people are already saying that the book is horrible and a great letdown and others go to the other extreme and hold faithfully that it's just as good as the previous books. I don't feel either take is fair or accurate. To be fair, yes, the book doesn't move like the previous books, especially a STORM OF SWORDS. There are simply not the same level of WHAM BAM big moments nor shocking realizations (i.e. who killed Jon Arryn?). Additionally, some of the favorite characters of readers, like Jon, Dany and Tyrion, are not in this novel. Lastly, there are two new main POVs so we need to adjust to those. BTW, since other readers are spoiling the mystery POVs, did most of you notice that Brienne is apparently a descendant of Dunk from THE HEDGE KNIGHT. Pretty kewl. :) Getting back to the debate, remember that: (1) This is only half of a mega-sized book. GRRM is putting out only half of it and the other half is going to be in the next book. So, in essence, for those complaining he's taking too long, this is like four books as the average novel is 400 pages. Additionally, remember the guy has been writing for something like 30 + years and he's finally getting national acclaim. He has been asked to write scripts to some of his old novels, there's a game based on his series that he looked over, he's also gone over the HEDGE KNIGHT comic strip, he's written two novelettes on the hedge knight, hes been asked to attend dozens upon dozens of readings at various book/convention events (and, most recently, the prestigious one in D.C. where he was asked to give a long speech), he tends to answer the emails he gets from everyone which is in the thousands, he taught at the Odyssey program for about six weeks back east, etc. Most of these in the last two years. So, bully for him as he's getting more acknowledgements but keep in mind the guy has said he can't write except back in New Mexico. Things are going to go slower; and (2) While several of the POVs don't have resolutions, also keep in mind that they may show up in the next book with all those WHAM BAM moments everyone is seeking. Additionally, it probably isn't fair to view this as a stand alone simply because book four and five are like one book. The reason he broke it up, per his webpage at [...], is that his publishers demanded he get it out. For all we know, book four may be the midpoint of the story and book five is going to have a lot of climaxes. AFFC is really a come down from several climaxes. As the dust settles, lots of information is shared. There's a great deal of focus on characters. Lots and lots of characters, even if fleeting. As a result, not as much seems to happen. To some, this might be seen as meanderings, and, well, yes, some of it probably is. lol For those who want to know more about the world, here's your chance. Just don't expect it to be like ASOS. I remember several complaints by earlier reviewers of previous books that there wasn't enough about context and almost nothing about the religion of the times. People complained that one would think the religion would have a greater impact and political power base than shown in the last three books. Well, you get it in this book. Big time. Another thing to keep in mind: there are probably about 35-50% more character POVs simply because there are several small focuses on various characters all over the globe. We get a lot of focus on Dorne and the Iron Isles as well as King's Landing. There are sprinklings in other areas, too, like Oldtown and where Brienne travels (i.e. don't want to spoil it so I won't say where). As result, these characters slows the story down from having big moments because there's more to tell. While I get this is probably the least popular book of the four, assuming we were to take a tally, I still feel GRRM is the best living fantasy author out there if you want tales that don't overuse archetypes and have complex characters and plots. I challenge anyone to email me to suggest a better author. On that note, for people who haven't read the previous books, here's why GRRM is a superb writer from my previous review on ASOS: First off, I'm a heavy duty fan of GRRM. I've read over a 100 different fantasy authors in my time. Took about 5 years off from the genre b/c I felt it was all getting too formulaic and cliched. Typical archetype character who turns out to be the missing heir or boy wonder who saves the world against the Dark Lord. So, when I came back to fantasy at the end of 1999, I read the usual: Goodkind, Jordan, etc. and then someone told me about GRRM and man, that was the kicker! Here are the reasons to choose GRRM. I've also listed the reasons not to choose him to make it fair b/c I know their are certain personalities who won't like this series: WHY TO READ GRRM (1) YOU ARE TIRED OF FORMULAIC FANTASY: good lad beats the dark lord against impossible odds; boy is the epitome of good; he and all his friends never die even though they go through great dangers . . . the good and noble king; the beautiful princess who falls in love with the commoner boy even though their stations are drastically different . . . the dark lord is very evil and almost one sided at times . . . you get the idea. After reading this over and over, it gets old. (2) YOU ARE TIRED OF ALL THE HEROES STAYING ALIVE EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE UNDER CONSTANT DANGER: this gets even worse where the author kills a main hero off but that person comes back later in the story. Or, a hero does die but magic brings him back. This sometimes carries to minor characters where even they may not die, but most fantasy authors like to kill them off to show that some risked the adventure and perished. (3) YOU ARE A MEDIEVAL HISTORY BUFF: this story was influenced by the WARS OF THE ROSES and THE HUNDRED YEARS WAR. (4) YOU LOVE SERIOUS INTRIGUE WITHOUT STUPID OPPONENTS: lots of layering; lots of intrigue; lots of clever players in the game of thrones. Unlike other fantasy novels, one side, usually the villain, is stupid or not too bright. (5) YOU ARE INTERESTED IN BIASED OPINIONS AND DIFFERENT TRUTHS: GRRM has set this up where each chapter has the title of one character and the whole chapter is through their viewpoint. Interesting tidbit is that you get their perception of events or truths. But, if you pay attention, someone else will mention a different angle of truth in the story that we rarely see in other novels. Lastly and most importantly, GRRM doesn't try to tell us which person is right in their perception. He purposefully leaves it vague so that we are kept guessing. (6) LEGENDS: some of the most interesting characters are those who are long gone or dead. We never get the entire story but only bits and pieces; something that other fantasy authors could learn from to heighten suspense. Additionally, b/c the points of views are not congruent, we sometimes get different opinions. (7) WORDPLAY: if you're big on metaphors and description, GRRM is your guy. Almost flawless flow. (8) LOTS OF CONFLICT: all types, too; not just fighting but between characters through threats and intrigue. (9) MULTILAYERED PLOTTING; SUB PLOTS GALORE: each character has their own separate storyline; especially as the story continues and everyone gets scattered. This is one of the reasons why each novel is between 700-900 pages. (10) SUPERLATIVE VARIED CHARACTERS: not the typical archetypes that we are used to in most fantasy; some are gritty; few are totally evil or good; GRRM does a great job of changing our opinions of characters as the series progress. This is especially true of Jaime in book three. (11) REALISTIC MEDIEVAL DIALOGUE: not to the point that we can't understand it but well done. (12) HEAPS OF SYMBOLISM AND PROPHECY: if you're big on that. (13) EXCELLENT MYSTERIES: very hard to figure out the culprits; GRRM must have read a lot of mystery novels. (14) RICHLY TEXTURED FEMALE CHARACTERS: best male fantasy author on female characters I have read; realistic on how women think, too. (15) LOW MAGIC WORLD: magic is low key; not over the top so heroes can't get out of jams with it. REASON TO NOT READ GRRM (1) YOU LIKE YOUR MAIN CHARACTERS: GRRM does a good job of creating more likeable characters after a few die. But, if that isn't your style, you shouldn't be reading it. He kills off several, not just one, so be warned. (2) DO NOT CARE FOR GRITTY GRAY CHARACTERS: if you like more white and gray characters, this may unsettle you. I suggest Feist or Goodkind or Dragonlance if you want a more straight forward story with strong archetypes. (3) MULTIPLE POINTS OF VIEWS TURN YOU OFF: if you prefer that the POVS only go to a few characters, this might be confusing for you. (4) SWEARING, SEX: there's a lot of it in this book just as there is in real life. If you have delicate ears, this book may upset you. (5) YOU DEMAND CLOSURE AT THE END OF EVERY BOOK: this isn't the case for all stories in the series. Some are still going on; some have been resolved; others have been created and are moving on. (6) IF YOU WANT A TARGET OR SOMEONE TO BLAME: this can be done to some extent but not as much. This is b/c he doesn't try to make anyone necessarily good or evil. (7) ARCHETYPES: some readers like archetypal characters because it's comfortable; we like the good young hero (sort of like Pug in Feist's THE RIFTWAR SAGA); it's familiar and we sometimes like to pretend we're this upcoming, great hero. You wont' get much of this in GRRM with the exception of one or two characters. There really aren't any super heroes compared to all the other characters as it's more grittier and no one is shooting fireballs every millisecond or carrying around some super powerful sword. (8) LENGTH: you don't want to get into a long fantasy epic series. In that case, look for shorter works as this is biiiiiig. (9) PATRIARCHY: men are most of the main characters with lots of power (one female exception). While this is realistic of the medieval era, some readers may not prefer this if they want more girl power, so to speak. By the way, if you don't want to commit to a big book until you know the author better, check out his short story, THE HEDGE KNIGHT, in LEGENDS."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/520753-kim", "userReview": "George R.

As a reader I\u2019ve grown somewhat used to things like this:So, when I'm just given things like this instead it\u2019s bound to disappoint: There are massive pacing issues with the most recent (ha! that\u2019s a joke) two books of the series, and I mean massive. There\u2019s a whole lot of nothing in this one. Cersei\u2019s chapters are excruciating to read. That\u2019s not surprising considering she is probably the least likable of characters within this series. This doesn\u2019t make the book bad because of this. I think she needed some point of view chapters, but what she didn\u2019t need was a never-ending amount of them; it was just too many. By doing this it meant that there were very few chapters that were enjoyable to read; there was no Tyrion, Dany, Jon Snow or Bran in the book.I think George. R. R Martin made a massive mistake when he decided to have this and  A Dance with Dragons  occur at the same time. The story clearly got away from him and became a little convoluted. The pacing is terrible; there is no real payoff in either book (unlike its predecessors). The book comes to an end at a random point of the story, which just didn\u2019t feel quite right. Personally, I think he should have continued the trend he set with his the previous books in the series. It just needed one straightforward time arc. We don\u2019t need events happening at the same time across books; it didn\u2019t need to become that complex; it\u2019s already perfectly complex. He\u2019s clearly wrote himself into a corner with it. Hence the time it\u2019s taken him to get the next book out. Well, that being said, there is still a lot to take from this book. The story does, of course, develop and become even more engaging. If anything this book made me count down the days to the release of  A Dance with Dragons.  But, that\u2019s not really a good thing. I think most people tend to forgive Martin for his slip into convolutedness because the previous books were so damn good. I just hope he has tamed the amount of new point of view characters in the much anticipated six book. I think it\u2019s far too late to add so many point of views into the series. One or two is understandable in a book of this type, but when it\u2019s like six or seven it becomes a little bit of a joke. It takes away from the central stories. I\u2019m moaning again here. I began to lay down the positives which just developed into another rant! Redeeming features This books not all bad, far from it. Arya\u2019s story takes a most interesting turn, and Jaime begins to search for his lost honour. These are amongst interesting characters of the entire series, so there points of view saved the book. And then Sam gets his moment in the light. Things do develop and go forward; we see the politics from a different angle. But, I still think it should have been all along one time arc; it would have been a lot easier. See what I mean? I just can\u2019t focus on the positives, so I\u2019m going to leave it here. I may complain about this book, but in reality it\u2019s only because I love this series so much. There are obvious problems with it, though it doesn\u2019t stop me from reading on or re-reading previous books. I may grit my teeth and cringe when I read certain chapters, but I\u2019ll read them again and complain about them again.

Since I am a completist I was going to love this book no matter what, and I do, but to the more casual fan this will definitely seem like a weak effort, and I think there's justice to this point of view. The writing here feels uneven to me -- so much time in the real world has passed that I feel like George's writing style has actually changed here. His characters begin using terms that they never used before in the preceeding books (\"nuncle\" and \"coz\", in particular). There's also an egregious amount of \"not giving a groat\" here. I'd hate to be a groat merchant in Westeros at this point. What the hell IS a groat?The interesting point of view structure of the previous books has been salted with an overabundance of \"prologue\" chapters that break with the structural traditions that George has already established. Enough with the Prologues! We're under siege here! Just give us one and hold on to some of that story telling goodness -- we already know you rule.For fans, I think the Brienne chapters feel like wasted time, though Martin tells us that there were stories that needed to be told in \"Feast\" lest the whole tale would suffer (and I can only presume he includes the 'Brienne' bits in that proclamation). I will reserve judgment here and wait to see.Also, the fact that only half the POVs (points of view) are represented in \"Feast\" leaves many fans cold. For myself, I needed me some more Tyrion and I didn't get it here. I believe once the remaining books are published, the profile of this book may improve. But this is clearly well-seasoned asparagus next to \"A Storm of Swords'\" filet mignon."}, {"userName": "Laz", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22313662-laz", "userReview": "\u201cHistory is a wheel, for the nature of man is fundamentally unchanging. What has happened before will perforce happen again.\u201d\nI think this may be my favorite novel in the series. Not because it was the best but because I felt so connected to the story, more than I have ever felt before while reading this series. And while I can admit that the plot was poorer in comparison with its predecessors and there weren't all of the characters we've grown accustomed to reading about, I still feel like Mr. Martin is one of a kind and his writing is one of the best I've ever had the luck of reading and I could never ever give this book anything less than 5 stars for the simple reason that with this book, the series has finally found a place in my heart.This book, as many of you may already know, is mainly focused upon King's Landing and some might say the South but I'm not so sure about that. In this book we read for the first time from Cersei's perspective and I have to admit that getting inside her head and seeing firsthand how her brain works, well, it was truly amazing. We see every single bit of malice the lovely Queen Regent has and how far she's willing to go to ensure that Tommen remains safe and sound from whoever tries to do him harm. The story, despite the absence of some of the characters, such as Tyrion, Daenerys & Jon, was still just as riveting and I think that was principally because of the fact that the plot twists and revelations were scattered throughout the book so it actually kept me on the edge and had me intrigued the entire time.In addition to Cersei, there's also quite lots of Jaime and I clearly saw him changing throughout the entire novel, from the tiny bits of details regarding how his brain works to the fact that he finally distances himself from Cersei and sees her for what she really is. He's sent to do Cersei's bidding and his last chapter in the novel, left my brain whirring.Apart from Cersei & Jaime's perspectives, there are bits and pieces of the Iron Islands, told from the point of view of Asha, Victarion & such. Balon Greyjoy is dead and someone has to succeed him.In the South, Oberyn's daughters, the Sand Snakes, want to avenge their father, so Doran is forced to prison them before they do something that will jeopardize everything. There's also a little bit of plotting from Arianne's side, who's Doran's daughter and his rightful heir. I never thought I'd like Arianne that much. She's quite bold and she has the guts to do what her father refuses to.This book was big enough and I understand why Mr. Martin divided the story into two parts. It would just be too huge if he had tried to write about all of the characters in one book and I understand he has a lot to write and a lot to give to us through his stories so honestly I'm not disappointed, if anything, I'm happy that he did that. The more the books, the merrier I'll be.The fact, that a person can build such an amazing world, with the tiniest of details, it's truly amazing and inspirational. I don't get how he does it and honestly I get why his books take so long to come out, I mean they're huge, they're full of made-up history. I mean I wouldn't even be able to remember the names if I were him. I admire his talent and I hope there are more amazing books to come. I cannot wait to get my hands on the next book, I'm anxious and ready for Jon, Dany & Tyrion's stories in the next book."}, {"userName": "April", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37089590-april", "userReview": "\"I have a hole where my heart should be, she thought, and nowhere else to go.\"// God, this book. George R.R Martin writes so beautifully. Beginning this I did miss Tyrion's, Daenery's, and Jon's POVs, but this book was exceptional even without them. Cersi despite not liking her in the show I actually grew to love her parts. Especially her writing to Jaime for help and reading his response in turn had to be my favorite."}, {"userName": "Ryan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1041498-ryan", "userReview": "I was fully prepared to be disappointed by this book, for several reasons. First of all, the last book, A Storm Of Swords, ended with a very large cliffhanger and I knew that it was a cliffhanger that wasn't going to be fully explained/explored in this volume.Additionally, I knew that in general the story was not going to feature the characters that I was most interested in (namely Daenerys, Theon, Tyrion, and especially the whole issue of Jon and the Night Watch). That being said, the volume was surprisely enjoyable, and helped to better explore the entirety of the Seven Kingdoms. There was tons of action in the first three volumes - I was actually a little set back by the amount of violence that was featured in the series altogether. This volume takes a somewhat quieter approach - characters die, but most of the death takes place off-page. Perhaps this means that A Dance With Dragons is going to feature much higher levels of action.Plot-wise, only certain amounts of progress are made of advancing the plot. We learn nothing more about the advancement of the Others, and no word is made of Daenerys' flight towards the west. Instead we get political maneuverings in King's Landing, and Sam's travel from The Wall to Oldtown. What we do get is quality material, though - I was on the bus when I got to the part of the story that featured Cersei's downfall, and I almost started cackling with joy to see her get her final comeuppance. Also of interest was the expanding story of the Seven Kingdoms, as we learn more about the cultures of both the Iron Islands and of Dorne. Interesting material, definitely, but material that feels much like it is build-up for the eventual landfall of Dany from the east, rather than material in its own right.[return:][return:]One of the benefits of the multiple-POV perspective that Martin employs is that it allows the reader to learn about characters not only from how they see themselves, but how they are viewed by those around them. Cersei Lannister, the most prominent character in AFFC, is the most obvious example of this - when she was presented mostly as a scheming mastermind, but in her POV chapters, she's seen as someone almost paralyzed by paranoia. Similarly, we see Jaime as either a sterling knight (from Brienne's perspective) or a craven weakling (from Cersei's perspective). When we see Jaime's one POV, though, we see that he thinks he is how Cersei sees him, but he hopes to become what Brienne believes him to be. It's a very effective literary technique, and easily builds suspense and complexity to a story of this size."}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3030788-melanie", "userReview": "1.)

Sometimes they refuse to make the moves you've planned for them.\u201d\n\nA Feast for Crows is my least favorite in this series, but this prologue and ending chapter give me life, I swear. GRRM is such a genius and if you have twenty minutes, I can't recommend this video, by Alt Shift X, enough. Seriously, these two plot points, that don't even seem to make sense, are going to play such a HUGE part in this world, and I'm still in awe over the genius.I kept debating if I wanted to give this book four or five stars, but this plot point brings me so much joy that I couldn't resist and ended up just giving this five stars, too. \n\n\u201cI don't want to have a dozen sons,\" she had told him, appalled. \"I want to have adventures\u201d\n\nI, also, absolutely loved all the feministic themes in this book. I know GRRM gets hate for all the violence against women in his books, but he writes some really empowering women, who I love to root for and read about: -Asha's whole story line, with her right to rule, but a bunch of men are telling her she can't solely because she is a girl. -Cersei finally ruling and acknowledging that everyone in her life has treated her like a piece of meat, only worthy of being married off to reproduce royal children, because she was born a woman, while seeing the male version of her (Jaime) thrive and live his dreams. -Brienne smashing the patriarchy and gender roles left and right, all while making me her biggest fan. Like, all of these themes make ASOIAF an even more enjoyable story to read. These are important themes that are very predominant in A Feast for Crows, and GRRM gives them the light they deserve. ASOIAF is truly an epic fantasy series above the rest. I love this book, I love being a part of this reread, and I really love being back in this world. ASOIAF is such an immersive and all-encompassing experience, I can't really put it into words. I will always recommend this series to anyone who will listen.The rest of this review will have spoilers from all the previous books and also spoilers for this book! If you have not read the first four books in this series, and do not want to get spoiled, please do not read this portion of my review!At this point in the story, so much is happening, I think I'm just going to break down the major plot lines and how I, personally, feel about them:Arya and the Many-Faced God - Again, I can't emphasize enough how amazing Alt Shift X's video is, and how informative it was for me during this reread. Arya has been through so much so far in this series. My heart always breaks for Arya. In A Feast for Crows, she finally finds a path with the God of Death's religion, where they literally take the faces of other people to kill others for their clients. Sansa/Alayne, Robert, and Littlefinger - This whole story line is just so creepy; Littlefinger is the epitome of gross. Robert was weak before his mother's death, and now even weaker. I'm just waiting for his death to come, at this point. Sansa pretending to be Littlefinger's daughter, Alayne, is pretty heartbreaking to read. Sansa has, also, lost so much and watching her get stronger and stronger is really rewarding. Asha, Euron, and Victarion - As much as I love Asha and watching her not back down over her right to the Iron Throne, Euron is probably the character I hate the most in this world. The juxtaposition is actually insane. The scene in Oakenshield Castle, with Euron, was very hard for me to read. Even though Euron wins the kingsmoot against Asha and Victarion, Victarion still agrees to bring Dany Euron's marriage proposal, yet, he has an ulterior motive that we will see in A Dance with Dragons.Cersei, Margaery, and Maggy the Frog - Let me preface this portion by saying: I think Cersei is one of the best villains I've ever read. All of her actions make sense, and you can't help but somewhat root for her. She is constantly being plagued by a vision a witch gave her at a young age, in which she predicted Cersei to become Queen, have three children that will all die, be overthrown by a younger and more beautiful girl, and to eventually die at the hands of her younger brother (who she thinks is 100% Tyrion, but I 100% think it will be Jaime - especially if books take the show's route). \n\n\u201cMen have scars, women mysteries.\u201d\n\nCersei thinks, by getting Margaery (who is now Queen, married to Tommen) out of the picture, she will ensure that Maggy the Frog's prophecy doesn't come true. You know, because she has no idea what Daenerys Targaryen is up to. Which brings us to...The High Sparrow - ...who is heavily foreshadowed to be an evil bastard from the start. Not only does he agree to doing to Gods' work with Margaery, but he then takes it upon himself to do it with Cersei, as well! I know most of us know how the show's version of this story-arc went down, but I cannot wait to actually read GRRM's book version, that will have major differences (like Loras Tyrell's storyline.)Jaime - The last thing Jaime does in this book, is receives the letter from Cersei letting him know all the shit that is going down in King's Landing. You know, because she sent him away for reasons. Oh, Jaime, you try so very hard to do what is right, but it always falls apart anyways. He is also harboring the secret of being the one that actually released Tyrion in A Storm of Swords, while being haunted with Tyrion's information of who is warming Cersei's bed. If I could ask for one happy ending for any of the characters in ASOIAF, I would ask for it to be Jaime's. His story-line is seriously one of the most compelling things I've ever read, and I have so much empathy for him. Brienne - Oh, and of course I ship Jaime with Brienne! Is it just me, or is their sexual tension out of this freakin' world? Like, I need this; I need this to happen very badly. Brienne is one of my favorite characters, and such an honorable soul, how could you not love her? She is still in search of Sansa, with Podrick Payne, Tyrion's old squire, in tow. On this journey she is constantly belittled for being a woman that is a knight, but never loses focus on her promise to Cat. Lady Stoneheart - AKA: Resurrected Cat, is on a killing spree for vengeance. Even though she can't really speak, because she died getting her throat slit, she and her group are seeking retribution for the Red Wedding in A Storm of Swords. In this book, she gives Brienne an ultimatum to either kill Jaime or die herself, and Brienne, being all that is right in this world, chooses death, but on a cliffhanger, of course! Sam, Gilly, the babe, and Maester Aemon - I'm not going to lie, Sam's chapters were a little unbearable for me. He, Gilly, the babe and Maester Aemon are on their way to the Citadel, where Sam is going to try to find something that will help them win the impending war that is looming with the White Walkers. My heart breaks for Gilly, because (unlike the show) it is stated that her and King-Beyond-the-Wall, Mance Rayder, switched children, because Melisandre wants to sacrifice a child of royal blood. I mean, this might be the saddest thing in this book. I can't even imagine Gilly's pain, and my empathy is off the charts for her. \n\n\u201cThere is no shame in loving. If your septons say there is, your seven gods must be demons. In the isles we know better. Our gods gave us legs to run with, noses to smell with, hands to touch and feel. What mad cruel god would give a man eyes and tell him he must forever keep them shut, and never look at all the beauty in the world? Only a monster god, a demon of the darkness.\u201d\n\nAemon accompanies them on this journey to the Citadel, because Jon, too, thinks that Melisandre would want to sacrifice him for his royal Targaryen blood, so he sends him away, as well. Sadly, he is dying as their boat makes it to Braavos, but not before realizing that Dany and her dragons are going to change the world.This series is so very close to my heart and I can't express enough how much I truly love it. I could triple my word count by gushing and fangirling about theories, but I'll save that for my A Dance with Dragons review! \n\n\u201cOne more book, he had told himself, then I'll stop. One more folio, just one more. One more page, then I'll go up and rest and get a bite to eat. But there was always another page after that one, and another after that, and another book waiting underneath the pile. I'll just take a quick peek to see what this one is about, he'd think, and before he knew he would be halfway through it.\u201d\n\nBlog | Twitter | Tumblr | Instagram | Youtube | Twitch"}, {"userName": "Jason Koivu", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1742824-jason-koivu", "userReview": "I know \"winter is coming,\" but this book honestly felt more like a Spring clean.A story of such lengths as the epic A Song of Ice and Fire has to have down time and much of A Feast for Crows is down time. George R.R. Martin ties up loose ends, sets up new story lines and essentially does administrative style organization in an attempt to keep his mammoth machine rolling. He does it admirably, and yet it can't help but lack the pep, surprise and all around thrill of his previous three books. In his defense, this book is only half a book. The one after it should have been its second half. The first half of books usually include a lot of house keeping. This definitely feels like a first half. It's a little dull.*HOWEVER, if you're already a Game of Thrones fan, I don't see how you could not enjoy this book. It's got most of your favorite characters. Cersei is still the same old lovable bat-crazy bitch. Arya and Brienne have never wandered more aimlessly. Jaime is still phantom masturbating. Granted, Jon Snow has little to do or say (then again, it's best to keep your mouth shut when you know nothing) and Daenerys seems to have sprouted dragon wings and flown off. Even so, new characters are introduced who should add a whole other layer of intrigue to the festivities. The aforementioned house keeping does drag on in the form of long council meetings and generally boring exposition. There are a lot of scenes written just to keep the story moving forward. The action and excitement come in short spurts, and the one big reveal had unfortunately already been revealed to me. Even so, I marched through this book with a will, happily following along even through the slow parts.As regards my rating, those 3 stars are a very strong three stars. For my overall enjoyment level, it should be four. However, I gave the previous three books in the series four stars each and since I didn't like this one quite as much as them, I had to show it somehow. And yet, I did enjoy this more than many other three star books I've read.* In an aside that I found humorous, at the end of A Feast for Crows Martin explains how this was meant to be the first half of a much larger book, but that the book became soooo unwieldy it had to be broken up into two books. And now here's the part I found funny...Martin said he hoped for the next book after this one to be published in about a year. Hahahahah! It turned out to be more like six years before A Dance with Dragons would appear. A year indeed.

Queen Cercei conspires to keep King Tommen's young queen from influencing him. Jaime Lannister adjusts to having only one hand. Sam Tarly and Gilly head south. Brienne quests for the missing Stark daughters. Littlefinger holds the Vale. A lot of stuff happens in Dorne. Arya Stark continues being one of the more interesting characters in fantasy...After a years-long void, the Song of Ice and Fire returns. Well, they can't all be home runs. Sometimes you have to settle for a triple. Aside from the lack of Jon Snow, Dany and the dragons, and one Tyrion Lannister, I enjoyed A Feast for Crows as much as the previous volumes. At this point, Jaime Lannister is hot on the heels of Arya, Jon Snow, and Tyrion as my favorite character. I could read a few hundred pages of Jaime Lannister walking around being an asshole. Sam got some time to shine and I think he'll do big things before the series is over. I love what's going on with Arya. I still don't care about Sansa or Catelyn Stark.The bits with the Iron Isles and Dorne got a little wearisome, feeling like Martin might have wanted to keep the biscuit wheels on his gravy train for a little while longer. Still, I liked where things went despite not involving any of my favorite characters.It's a testament to Martin's skill that he has made me care about the Lannister twins, first Jaime and now Cercei. I'm chomping at the bit to find out Cercei's fate and to see if Brienne is really dead.On a final note, there were way too many characters whose names started with the letter E in the same chapter.

They were right. However, there is a very good reason which Martin explains as soon as you reach the final page. A Feast for Crows as well as a Dance with Dragons were supposed to be a single book. Martin wanted to avoid creating a humongous book so he came up with this excellent and most profitable idea to split it in half. Of course that worked perfectly fine with me because I hate heavy books (they end up falling on my face-seriously it's dangerous and distracting). In fact, I did exactly the same thing with A Storm of Swords, which is a favourite for most of you. I didn't read a single book, I bought 2 separate volumes (1. Steel and Snow & 2. Blood and Gold). I can clearly remember that the first part was much less interesting than the second one(which is why I gave it 4 stars). Yet if you ask me to rate the book as a whole I would give it 5 stars without thinking. So this is exactly the case here. Yes some chapters were rather boring but I still believe Martin gave them to us for good reason. I found this book extremely informative. Many of my questions about Dorne and the Iron islands were answered. Consider this book as Martin's effort to give you a complete view of our story. In the previous book hell broke loose (all 7 of them)Kings rose, Kings fell, houses were obliterated, Martin had to tell us somehow how this affected the rest of Westeros. I think this is why he called it A Feast for Crows: There was so much blood in book 3, so many dead, it was necessary to show us who would try to take advantage of the situation, who would feast upon the dead... Apparently there are so many new characters who like playing the game of thrones. I loooved Cercei's chapters. They were by far the best. I mean wow, thank God that woman is fictional. If you loved to hate Joffrey wait till you read Cercei's chapters. I also enjoyed Sansa's chapters because I got the chance to read about some of Littlefinger's cunning plans. Whenever he explains one of his plans I go like: Woooooa how on Earth did Martin come up with that? Is he even human? Jamie's chapters were amazing too. We see some real character development there.My least favourite chapters were those of Dorne and the Iron islands and some of Brienne's (towards the end they got much better). The final chapters were amazing though!Be warned: There are no chapters told from Jon's, Dany's or Tyrion's perspective. Tyrion's???? Seriously???

How did she suddenly get so dumb witted? \"Have you seen a maid of three and ten, very beautiful with blue eyes and auburn hair?\" If I had to read that line one more time, I would have burnt the book.

Martin brings the POV of characters we have seen from the point of view of the orthodox characters chapters. In A Feast For Crows, we get so many Cercei chapters, a lot of Jaime, and so much of Brienne, a mediocre portion of Sam, yet too little of Arya, Sansa, and merely a few-line scene of Jon Snow, and nothing of Tyrion. But what we also get in this volume is the characters who are behind the scenes, and we get to visit Dorne, the Iron Isles, and even more exciting, a few glimpses of the Citadel. Like so many before me, I would say yes, this book lacked the 'frequency' of major, bombshell action scenes, but you see, this book wasn't so much about events as much as it is a character-driven book. In A Feast For Crows, we see Cercei and enter her psychotic mind, which I have fallen in love with. You find out about her constant insecurities, her will to prove herself as the most powerful woman the Seven Kingdoms has known, and to what extent she would go in order to 'protect' her son. In this book, she takes her schemes and wickedness to a whole new level, higher than we have ever seen from her in the previous books.After Cercei's, my second favorite character chapters are Brienne's. We get to know more of Brienne, her past, childhood, how she was bullied in a younger age because of how built she is like a man and wasn't acting like the Lord's lady she is supposed to be in a world ruled by men. We find out about her insecurities to prove herself in this world. She is fierce, brave, gentle, and kind, a character who is so great and true to her word, a true knight.My third favorite character chapters are Jaime's. Jaime is a character whom we disliked the moment we lied our mind's eye upon in these books and our eyes upon in the TV-series, but as of the quarter of book 3, A Storm Of Swords, Jaime becomes a greater character and chivalrous, trying to prove himself against his infamous name 'Kingslayer', as a true knight should be, true to his words. He tries very hard to repent for his infamous acts, and he is tested to stay true to his promises to Lady Catelyn Stark. And in this book, Jaime will surprise you more than ever!As for the minor characters, I loved Asha Greyjoy's, who, just as Cercei and Brienne, is trying to prove herself, no matter how many men patronized her and tried to undermined her. She is a strong character, and has bigger balls than most of the men in the Iron Isles.In addition to Asha, I also found her uncle Aeron's two or three chapters interesting and fun, and a bit intense. Through his eyes, Asha's, and Victarion Greyjoy's we see the world of the Iron Isles as we have never seen before in Theon Greyjoy's chapters in the second book. We get to know who is who, and about their god, the Drowned god, and their belief system and their family history.Alas, here I have to list the chapters that I either disliked or enjoyed the less: - Arya's: I couldn't handle her chapters, no matter how fierce she is trying to prove. Maybe, it is because we only see her in a handful of chapters. - The Dorne princess Arianne's: Goddamned, how naive and dislikeable she is. - Sam's: Most of his chapters are enjoyable, but not all. However, that last chapter of his, which parallels the last chapter of this book, is MIND-BLOWING. It left me with soooo many questions. - Sansa's: Usually, her chapters are one of my favorite ones. And in this book, we get to see her so little, with a less energetic pace. But I enjoyed her chapters a little bit.I think the reason that many people enjoyed this book less than is because it was very different than the former three for the reasons I've mentioned above, which some might find it a bit intimidating. But for me, it was an epic read and definitely one of the best books I've read this year. I enjoyed the characters, the writing-style and prose and the description, and the colorfulness of this world.And now, I got to get back to A Dance With Dragons and find out more answers about A Feast For Crows' abrupt epilogue, and back to old friends, Tyrion, Dany, and Jon, expecting more of Sansa and Arya.A Dance With Dragons, here I come . . ."}, {"userName": "Mohammed Arabey", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13592557-mohammed-arabey", "userReview": "\u0637\u064a\u0628 ,\u062e\u0644\u0635\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0632\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0644\u062b 10 \u0645\u0627\u064a\u0648 2015\u0648\u0642\u0628\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0644\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0648\u0641\u064a \u0644\u064a\u0644\u0629 10 \u0645\u0627\u064a\u0648 2014 \u0643\u0646\u062a \u0642\u0631\u0631\u062a \u0623\u0628\u062f\u0623 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0648 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0647 \u0631\u064a\u0627\u062d \u0648\u063a\u0627\u0626\u0645\u0627 \u0628\u0639\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u064a\u0627\u0645 \u0645\u0646\u0630 \u0623\u0639\u064a\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0639 \u0623\u062b\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u0642\u0631\u0627\u0621\u062a\u064a \u0644\u0644\u0623\u062c\u0632\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0636\u064a\u0629 \u062d\u062a\u064a \u0634\u0639\u0631\u062a \u0648\u0643\u0623\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0644\u0639\u0646\u0629 \"\u0623\u063a\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0644\u064a\u062f \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0631\" \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0634\u062a\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0648\u064a\u0644 ,\u062a\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0638\u0627\u0647\u0631\u0629 \u0628\u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u064a\u0628\u0623\u0645\u0627 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0635\u064a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u0643\u0646\u062f\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u062c\u0631 11 \u0645\u0627\u064a\u0648 2015 \u0639\u0627\u0635\u0641\u0629 \u0631\u0639\u062f\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0628\u0631\u0642 \u0641\u064a \u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621\u0647\u0627 \u0644\u0623\u0648\u0644 \u0645\u0631\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0642\u062a \u062a\u0642\u0631\u064a\u0628\u0627 \u0645\u0646\u0630 \u0639\u0634\u0631 \u0633\u0646\u0648\u0627\u062a..\u0648\u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0628\u0645\u062c\u0631\u062f \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628\u062a\u064a \u062a\u0639\u0644\u064a\u0642 \u0627\u0646\u064a \u0642\u0631\u0631\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062f\u0621 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0632\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0639 \u063a\u062f\u0627 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0623\u0646 \u0643\u0646\u062a \u0645\u0642\u0631\u0631\u0627 \u0642\u0631\u0627\u0621\u062a\u0647 \u0644\u0627\u062d\u0642\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0631\u064a\u0641 \u0627\u0646 \u0634\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\u062d\u0633\u0646\u0627..\u0627\u0644\u0634\u062a\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0648\u064a\u0644 \u0642\u062f \u062e\u0631\u062c \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0627:)\u0639\u0627\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0633\u0639\u064a\u062f \u0644\u0639\u0634\u0642\u064a \u0644\u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0648 :)\u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0641\u062c\u0631 11 \u0645\u0627\u064a\u0648 2015"}], "description": "Alternate covers can be found here.With A Feast for Crows, Martin delivers the long-awaited fourth volume of the landmark series that has redefined imaginative fiction and stands as a modern masterpiece in the making.After centuries of bitter strife, the seven powers dividing the land have beaten one another into an uneasy truce.
