Super twisty and held my attention from the first to last page. I wasn't expecting the ending and was extremely impressed with the way the story was told in reverse; a difficult feat that was pulled off nicely. Very satisfying and suspense filled read!Nicolette \"Nic\" Farrell has returned home to help fix up her and brother Daniel's family home. Their father has dementia and they need the money to pay for his care at the Grand Pines assisted living home. Nic has made a life for herself in Pennsylvania after leaving her hometown of Cooley Ridge 10 years earlier following the disappearance of best friend Corinne Prescott. Shortly after returning home, another girl from childhood named Annaleise Carter disappears and the town is whipped into a frenzy again while searching for answers in the present and past. As I said above, I think what pushed this into 5 star territory for me was the structure of this story. After the initial chapter is set up, we jump ahead 15 days and go backwards from there to find out what has happened in these missing two weeks. This was executed flawlessly IMO and made this a truly unique read as I've not had this reading experience before.The characters were fairly well developed but for a good half of the book most are kept at arms length as to not give too much away early on. Everyone has something to hide in this story; I had fun trying to determine who was a part of what part (present and past). The flow of the story was continuous and I truly did not want to put this down as it was an addicting read. I honestly am confused as to why this book is marketed as \"the next Gone Girl\" when the storyline was completely different. Please don't let that stop you from reading this if you are as tired of the \"Gone Girl comparison mania\" as I am! I enjoyed this one far more. This book is being marketed as Simon and Schuster's top adult debut of the year and I can see why. I highly recommend to anyone who is a lover of mystery and suspense novels. This will definitely be one of my top books of the year."}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27709782-jen", "userReview": "I actually had my review almost fully formed when I was 3/4 done. I was promised a jaw dropping read per the book flap but, at best, this was a mouth twitch, brow rise. I know I'm going against the current on this one- many adored this story.Personally, I hated the structure. It's told backwards- 2 weeks. 10 days, 4 days, one day...all the day before. Wtf? Too confusing and when I have to work at timelines, I check out.However, as I continued on - I was curious- there were some triumphant twists.I'm not going to summarize the story - you can get that from the title. Although not sure when 2 girls can be defined as \"all\". Semantics?So although this didn't take me to the thrilling white knuckled world, it does get points for the element of surprise. 3*"}, {"userName": "Melissa \u2665 Dog/Wolf Lover \u2665 Martin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin", "userReview": "Re-read of this book through audio 2017. The narrator did a great job \ud83d\ude0aI have to say the cover of this book is beautiful, at least to me! I also think it makes a great background for a thriller book! HOLY CRAP ON A CRACKER! THIS BOOK ROCKED!Okay at one point I forgot the blurb and thought I was losing what is left of my mind. The book is going along from the beginning and then all of the sudden (BAM) we are at a part that I don't remember getting to.... Then my little brain catches up that this book is written backwards. You get a little bit in the beginning so you know what's going on and then it starts backtracking. This would seem confusing but it's not! Every little piece starts clicking right into place..click..click...click..On with the story! EXCERPTMissing girls had a way of working their way into someone's head. You couldn't help but see them in everyone--how temporary and fragile we might be. One moment here, and the next, nothing more than a photo staring from a storefront.I can not say enough how much this book is fan-freaking-tastic! I haven't read a thriller this good in a long time. I had some ideas who the killer was but nooooooooooooo.. just no.. I can't even. Nicolette (Nic) moved away from home in the Smokey Mtns. of North Carolina years ago. She came back once but it's really just been 10 years, her best friend Corinne went missing and some other stuff went down and she had to go. She went to college and was working as a counselor and met a nice man through her neighbor and they ending up being engaged at one point. His name was Everett and he was a very nice lawyer. If he only knew what he stepped into with this town. So Nic gets a call from her brother Daniel saying he wants her to come home because their dad is getting worse and he wants to sell the house. The one other time she went back they had put him in a home because of Dementia. He's in and out of it and he's starting to say things. Things that make so sense. He keeps saying he saw the girl and Nic is in danger. ?????So Nic is back and cleaning up the house. She talks to her old high school flame, Tyler and has a weird sort of relationship with her brother Daniel and his wife Laura. And Nic still has some feelings for Tyler and I would say the feeling is mutual but he's dating Annaleise Carter. And guess what? She goes missing. What? So now there are two girls from this town that are missing and the town is stumped. Meanwhile, Nic's fiance comes to town and helps out by getting the cops to leave Nic's dad alone. He's spouting out things about the missing girl from 10 years ago and other crazy talk. It's not really crazy though is it? There is something locked in that brain of his and people think he was just a drunk that fell into drinking and craziness after his wife died and he only got worse. There are reasons for so many things. I do not want to say any more because I am afraid of giving out a spoiler. Let me just say this book is not what you think it's going to be! It threw me for a loop. I'm buying it when I can and reading it again. It's so out there that I want to read it over and over. If you see any of the stuff coming in this book before it's laid out for you then you are a genius and kudos to you =)The characters are complex and wonderful. The whole atmosphere of the book is great. I loved every little thing about the book, with the exception of their being a few heart breaks included. But that's life. I also know who killed these girls but I'm not telling you! *I would like to thank Netgalley and Simon & Schuster for inviting me to read this wonderful book in exchange for my honest review.*MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List"}, {"userName": "karen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45618-karen", "userReview": "congratulations! semifinalist in goodreads' best mystery/thriller category 2016!\"There you are.\"okay, i have now officially read this book twice - once the way it was intended, with its reverse-countdown of days and events, and once backwards, following the plot chronologically.which begs the question: which one is better?my friend connor is very critical of nonlinear chronologies (in movies, anyway - he's no booknerd). his complaint about them, and it's absolutely a valid one, is that many times this device is just a candy-coated distraction adding the illusion of interest to what would be an unremarkable story if it were told chronologically. if the gimmick is the only appeal, there's no reason to watch it a second time, when you know where all the puzzle pieces go.*so, i can feel you wondering - what about this one? get to the point already jeeeez.honestly, i think in this case, the gimmick is almost an obstacle.it's a great hook, don't get me wrong, and 87% of the people who read this book are going to be reading it for that reason alone - to see if she can pull it off, and it certainly distinguishes itself from the 9 million other \"girl\" psych suspense books being published on a weekly basis these days. and it's fun, it really is - you get your bookends of 'before' and 'after' sandwiched around this fifteen-day reverse-chronology where conclusions are reached that have no significance to the reader until their import is made apparent further down the road. and that imbalance is alluring, it keeps you turning those pages, digging deeper until you reach the foundation. and maybe i'm evaluating this with the boost of second-read clarity, and had i read it only chronologically, i would have dismissed it as just another 'missing girl' book, forgetting it immediately, but i definitely liked it better the second time. i think the gimmick made me squint too hard, thinking i should be scrutinizing every detail looking for clues which only served to complicate the straightforward and made me see some contradictions that i did not see reading it the second time. the structure is definitely funusual and forces the reader to engage in stimulating mental gymnastics, but some details get lost in the shuffle - unanswered questions that she was maybe hoping no one would notice? they're mostly minor: who was in the woods that night nic smelled the cigarette? who was in the apartment across from tyler's? why does daniel hit nic? why was so much made of the caverns when there was no real payoff in that direction? how is annaliese their \"alibi\" on the night corrine goes missing when everything she witnessed occurred when corrine was alive and well and standing right in front of her? do the police really need to be called every time a patient with dementia says something vaguely incriminating? how does corrine get from point a to point b and why on earth does\u2026? who the hell would sleep all alone in a house with a broken lock in a town where girls keep going missing and everyone knows everything, including whose locks are broken? and small town or not, broken lock or not, how do you just leave the house without even closing the door? would someone really \"reek\" of alcohol after holding a sip in their mouth for a moment hours earlier and do breathalyzers not exist? how is nic alluding to something on \"day one,\" that she has not yet experienced? it's a little sloppy, but considering how much of it does work, it's no fun spending time poking holes in it.even without the novelty of unconventional structure, there's enough here to grab my attention: a tale of three small-town mean girls and the boys who circle them, until their charismatic queen bee corrine goes missing after (before?) a night in which many small things chain-react into one huge consequence, supplying the town with limitless gossip. ten years later, and nic, one of those girls (the medium-mean in the mean-girl spectrum), returns home to help her brother daniel prepare their childhood home for sale to afford their dementia-addled father's care in an assisted living facility. she's engaged to a successful lawyer named everett, and is a school counselor at schmancy prep school in philly, where young damaged girls consider her a valuable confidante:Maybe they knew I had seen darker things. That I would understand. Or perhaps they would sense that I am an excellent keeper of secrets..I am.however, once nic is back in cooley ridge, n.c., another girl (woman) goes missing - annaliese carter, the current girlfriend of nic's former flame tyler, and then everything starts going sideways (or more precisely, backwards). nic's father begins to talk about seeing the \"missing girl,\" the police get involved, and all the secrets kept for ten years are compromised as history repeats itself in a particularly rumor-fueled town. When Corrine disappeared and we ran out of places to search, people to question, leads to track down, the only thing left for people was the talk.About Corrine and Bailey and me. Reckless and drunk on life, never thinking of the consequences. How we passed around a bottle in the clearing outside the caverns and invited boys inside. How we lifted candy bars from the convenience store (on a dare, always on a dare) and didn't respect property or authority. How we had no boundaries with each other, a tangle of limbs and hair and sun-kissed skin.ah, corrine\u2026 such a deliciously twisted mean girl. she's the kind of mean girl who will help you deal with your mother's death through the healing power of arson: \"Want to watch something burn?\"and nic, full of grief and adolescent helplessness, absolutely wants to watch something burn. something like an abandoned barn:She let me strike the match, and she held my hand as we watched it burn to the ground. We stood too close to it, so close we could feel each time a piece of wood caught, sparked, ignited.corrine is a ferocious bundle of manipulation and cruelty - always testing the limits of people's devotion to her, subjecting them to impromptu truth-or-dares, in which the other girls quickly learn to always choose \"dare.\" Nobody would ever love you so fiercely, so meanly, so thoroughly. And the parts of you that you wanted to keep hidden - she loved these most of all.everett is horrified by nic's stories of her relationship with corrine, which he quite rightly sees as unhealthy. Everett had never been a teenage girl - maybe there was some equivalent in the adolescent male, something that simmers under the surface of a friendship like that. But the simple truth was that when a girl like Corrine loves you, you don't ask why. You just hope it doesn't change.but then everett is an outsider; not only has he never been a teenage girl, but he's not \"from here,\" living a life of privilege and protection, too refined to relate to nic's experiences, too sensitive to look into the darkness:\"I don't know if i have the stomach for my job\u2026I do my job well, don't get me wrong. But sometimes there's a moment. A moment when you realize the person you're defending is guilty. And you can never go back\u2026I'm a better lawyer when I don't know.\"which does not bode well for the future of their relationship. enter love triangle! as a reader, i'm usually bored by the romantic bits of books, but this one was particularly irritating. it did not read like the behavior of mature adults, it was like a child playing with dolls in some blue blood v blue collar showdown: this one is rich but this one is infatuated, this one's your past and this one's your future, this one knows everything about you and this one knows only the good stuff and now is kissytime!but apart from that - it's a good thriller. the reverse-timeline keeps you on your toes, and the inclusion of so many scenes detailing the events surrounding corrine's disappearance ten years previous adds another layer of unfolding-mystery to the mix, as well as nic's sleep and food-deprivation contributing potentially hallucinatory unreliability to her perspective. the pacing is tight and breathless, helped along by all the imagery of things spinning and being blurry and always in motion, mirroring the frenetic whirlwinds characterizing the adolescent experience: Boys and their uncontrollable passion, impulsive and coiled to snap. Girls, with the uncontrollable yearning for something intangible. Something else.but that \"coiled to snap\" brings up another problem i had - the depiction of (mostly male) violence here is a little disturbing, particularly in light of this statement from our heroine:It happens like this - men losing themselves in moments of passion. We drive them to it. It's not their fault.pretty much every man in the book, even milquetoast everett, is shown to be overwhelmed by their anger at a woman at some point, demonstrating their rage by punching, bruising, slamming cupboards, throwing plates, pushing people down stairs, slamming fists into tables\u2026 it's off-putting, this caveman bullshit, especially in light of nic's bullshit statement absolving them from blame. it reminded me of how horrible some of those old vintage harlequins were, like this one where you read it and you can't even imagine how a character could forgive this behavior in a love interest, but this \"every boy is violent and it's all our fault\" attitude is much ickier to encounter in a contemporary novel written by a woman. so, despite my irritants, this is a 3.5 i have rounded up to 4.* paraphrased like crazy"}, {"userName": "Kristin (KC) - Traveling Sister", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4971692-kristin-kc---traveling-sister", "userReview": "...Just about *3 stars*\nAll\n the Missing girls?Because I\u2019m always down for a healthy dose of originality, I was pretty intrigued when I learned this story was told in a reverse format: starting in the present then moving backwards in time, pretty much a single day each chapter. As cool as this sounds in theory, it unfortunately ended up being more of a distraction than anything else. I often found myself backpedalling, convinced I\u2019d somehow missed vital details of the plot. I gave this book 3 stars because I wanted to know more at every turn of the page; I craved it. When I wasn't reading, I was thinking about reading\u2026wondering who did it and why\u2026if another disappearance would strike\u2026when the scattered pieces would all come together. There were moments in this story that came alive and gave me chills, and the tone was steady: eery and suspenseful\u2014exactly what I long for in thrillers. But, while the premise of this story was strong and contagious, its execution felt half-hearted and seemed to lack some follow-through. In fact, certain *details* felt as though they were forgotten altogether, leaving me to question their presence entirely. The author does a lot of \u201ctelling\u201d and although it\u2019s necessary in some cases, there\u2019s much more power in showing readers how ideas unfold.The characters: young, unhinged, bold, deceitful\u2014good framework, but never exactly felt three-dimensional. And finally, the highly anticipated outcome\u2026what all this intense buildup was for. Not only did it not surprise, but I was ultimately left feeling unmoved. I felt the story had so much potential to \u201cwow\u201d, but didn't fully commit to its direction. It still feels slightly \u201cunfinished\u201d and yet the story is in fact complete.All of that said, many readers seemed to have LOVED this, which is understandable; The plot certainly keeps you on your toes, wanting to learn more."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9684061-melissa", "userReview": "This is one of the best books I\u2019ve read this year\u2014without a doubt. I was pretty intrigued when I first heard the story was told in the reverse - who tells a story backward? Was it just a ploy to make it seem different from other suspense novels or would it really work? I was kind of skeptical, not entirely sure the author could pull it off, but she did. The result was a twisted and very addictive story, one that took me completely by surprise. What I loved most about this story was Nicolette. Strong and independent, she settled down in Philadelphia and started a new life. One very different from the small town she left behind 10 years earlier when her best friend, Corinne disappeared. It\u2019s a strange letter from her ailing father and a promise to help her brother that gets her to return home.\n\u201cI need to talk to you. That girl. I saw that girl.\u201d\nA few days after her return another girl goes missing. Is it just a coincidence the missing girl happens to be the alibi witness for Nic and her friends the night Corinne went missing? Nic\u2019s father isn\u2019t any help, he has memory problems and gets agitated easily and her brother\u2014where to start with him. They have somewhat of an awkward relationship and it\u2019s obvious he has something to hide. But what? One of my other favorites was Tyler. He's always loved Nic and their relationship was pretty intense back in the day. He can\u2019t be responsible for the disappearances though, right? And how could Nic leave him behind?The author was so darn successful in making me doubt each and every one of these characters. I had no clue who was really guilty. My list of suspects changed constantly and in the end, I was wrong. I love when that happens!You would think that by reading a story told in reverse, you would have some sense of how it\u2019s going to end. That the author would give something away, but she didn't. Believe me when I say, the execution of this story was nothing short of clever. Going back and piecing everything together, to make sure every little detail truly fit, became part of the intrigue.I loved, loved, loved the ending\u2014I can't say it enough. It all boiled down to family and the notion that maybe, just maybe, we all have a monster inside of us.

The suspense continued to build up making for an addicting read.There are even flashbacks to the group ten years ago that also consist of a dangerously intense teenage female friendship.I really enjoyed the characters and the way their stories slowly unraveled within the reverse narrative. Excellent characterization. These characters may fall a bit more on the unlikable side for some people, but I enjoy my thrillers with flawed individuals. I like having reasons to question every character\u2019s motives and the possibility that they might not be so reliable. In a way it adds to the mystery helping to create additional red herrings. Though  Megan Miranda didn\u2019t need that help because there are several set up within the story.This may have been my first from the author, it won\u2019t be my last. The writing was very good.

The story is told in a unique way - working backwards in time, starting with the present day, which serves to keep the reader off balance for the entirety of the book. Initially, I was concerned at how well this would work but this was unneccessary as it worked absolutely perfectly. It's a story that really can only be told in reverse.The story begins with Nicolette (Nic) reluctantly returning to her hometown of Cooley Ridge to help her brother fix up her father's home in order to sell it, they need the money to pay for their father's care since he was placed in an assisted living facility due to dementia. Nicolette has not been home since she was eighteen and her friend, Corinne Prescott disappeared. Corinne was never found and no one knows what happened to her.

Join Nicolette, Daniel, and Tyler (Nicolette\u2019s boyfriend) as they set out to get answers.This seems to be a novel you either love or hate and the main sticking point for many is the way is is told in reverse.

She was never found.The original investigation had centered around:\u2022\tNic\u2022\tDaniel-Nic\u2019s brother\u2022\tTyler Ellison-Nic\u2019s boyfriend at the time\u2022\tJackson Porter-Corinne\u2019s boyfriendDaniel and wife Laura are expecting a baby.Jackson works at the town bar.Tyler is dating Annaleise Carter, a younger neighbour, the group\u2019s alibi the night Corinne disappeared.When Nic returns\u2026Annaleise goes missing!Only Nic left this small rural town and has a new life in Philadelphia, being engaged to a lawyer, Everett. Back again to get her father\u2019s house ready to be sold as he suffers from dementia and is in a nursing home. Nic is soon lurched into a scandalous drama that revives Corinne\u2019s case and open old wounds and memories.Is the disappearance of these two missing girls-Corinne and Annaleise-linked together somehow?The story then jumps forward 15 days and then is told in reverse. I was totally engrossed in the story. I had to find out what happened to the girls and why.The entire story is in Nic's first person perspective, and it worked well. This was an in-depth character-driven suspense novel that covered teenage friendships, relationships where everyone had a secret and the truth was revealed slowly like a pot simmering on the stove. So many twists and turns with an ending that I didn\u2019t see coming. But most of all this novel explores the length that a person is willing to go to protect their loved ones. \u201cLife must be understood backwards\u2026 but it must be lived forward.\u201d -Soren KierkegaardMany thanks to Simon & Schuster via NetGalley for my copy."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9472704-linda", "userReview": "I received a copy of All the Missing Girls by Megan Miranda through NetGalley for an honest review. My thanks to Simon and Schuster and to Megan Miranda for the opportunity.The ferris wheel.You know the uncertainty of the ride. The tilting and the swaying of the individual cars as you cast your fate to the backwards pitch. Slowly, gaining speed and not really knowing what the view is behind you. Trusting that you will reach the top. Then the shocking thrust of the forward plunge. And it all begins again.....Megan Miranda presents her mystery/thriller just like that ferris wheel ride. You begin this story on Day 15 and proceed to visit each preceding day until you can't bear the tension anymore. You are determined to find out what really happened on that fateful Day 1. You must know. You must.Nicolette Farrell receives a phone call from her brother, Daniel. Their father suffers from dementia and is in an assisted living facility in Cooley Ridge on the edge of the Smoky Mountains. There is much to handle and to organize for the sale of their father's house. Nic headed as far away from her home town as possible years ago. She now lives in Philadelphia, is engaged to Everett who is a lawyer, and has worked hard on her degree. After a ten year absence, Cooley Ridge is the last place that she wants to step back into. Family matters are one thing, but an intensely shadowed past is another.And that past involves her missing best friend, Corinne Prescott. And how is it that Corinne ends up missing in the midst of the throng of her teenage friends? No one has answers. No one seems to know a thing about that night when their numbers dwindled by one. Not even a carelessly thrown ticket to a well-lit carnival ride. Nothing. Absolutely nothing.And now another girl goes missing. And why ten years later does this all seem familiar?Nic will lead you through this winding maze of events.....a maze that doesn't exist in a normal time frame. Crazy, you say. And crazy are the flashes of the past that you will be privy to.....one day at a time. One interaction of characters at a time.Megan Miranda has attempted to keep your mind at a half kilter here.

Besides a gimmick of telling the main story backwards (which I swear I have seen before in books like \"The Secret History\") there was nothing appealing about this book. The main character was terrible, her family was terrible, and there was no development at all with secondary characters. I didn't get a sense of anyone at all and when I got to the letdown of an ending I was really ticked I had wasted any time at all with this.Nicolette (or Nic) is reluctant to return to her hometown. We know that she is still haunted by her best friend Corrine that disappeared years ago. Nic left town and ended up going to school and settling in Philadelphia. She met a great guy named Everett and is finally engaged. However she feels stunted by her past and when her brother Daniel calls her to help with selling their family home she goes. Deciding to take two months off to help her brother Daniel, Nic is quickly confronted with an old boyfriend (Tyler) who is now dating Annaleise. Things go sideways for Nic again though when Annaleise goes missing just like Corrine did years ago.Nic sucks. Sorry, when you eventually go from day 15 back to day 1 you have all of these things revealed which just makes her a small and just messed up person. I don't see any \"Gone Girl\" comparisons here since with Amazing Amy you get a really cool reveal about her. Telling the book backwards like she did, Miranda hid things until they were revealed earlier on which doesn't work. There were so many plot holes that I skipped counting them after a while.I had so many questions about Nic's family, but everything dealing with her father and brother Daniel was vague. There is barely any dialogue by the way by anyone in this story. So you are fully immersed in Nic's head at all times. People's motivations for doing anything was murky and downright stupid at times.Tyler is pathetic from beginning to end. I still don't get what drew him to Nic or her to him. Once again I am going to blame this on the writing though. Maybe if Miranda had told the story with the setup of everyone involved and then jumped to the present it would have worked better. But instead we just glimpses of Tyler and everyone else in this book through the count back day gimmick. And Tyler acting like a spurned lover though he has been dating and having sex with other women and Nic acting like they had this bond was ridiculous. Once again I am going to blame that on the narrative structure. The writing I found to be so-so. Honestly, there was way too much tell going on here. And I had a hard time with even understanding why thing on day 15 would be vague since by then Nic obviously knows what happens and who did what. You can't do it that way and then have readers go the whole way to day 1 and all of a sudden things suddenly make sense. Frankly Miranda should have said on day 15 what went on and who did what and then you can work forward that way. This makes me think a little bit of \"The Secret History\". \"The Secret History\" worked better for me even though you have the reveal of who did what and who was murdered upfront. You get to work forward (or backwards in a way) and get to see what was the final incident that caused the murder.The setting of this small town does not come alive at all. Probably because of the structure of the book. Besides Nic and Daniel's childhood home no place felt \"real\" to me while reading.The ending was a joke and a half."}, {"userName": "Lala BooksandLala", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31027440-lala-booksandlala", "userReview": "No star rating.

'There is nothing more dangerous, nothing more powerful, nothing more necessary and essential for survival than the lies we tell ourselves.' But we don't just lie to ourselves; we lie to others as well. And where do those lies end? Or do they end? If they are told enough times and for long enough, do they become mistaken for the truth?I can see that this book had to be written this way and, strangely enough, it works. But did I like it? I still don't know. It intrigued me. It had me thinking 'clever!' and at times 'very clever!'. But I was quite happy to put it down and walk away. It did not take over my life, as some books do.

This is what a thriller should be.Ten years ago Nicolette Farrell's best friend Corinne disappeared from their North Carolina hometown one night. No one could figure out what happened to Corinne, although the investigation brought a lot of people's secrets to light, and made everyone a suspect\u2014Nic, her then-boyfriend Tyler, her brother, and Corinne's boyfriend, Jackson. It wasn't long before Nic left Cooley Ridge, getting rid of her accent and putting her old life\u0097and those in it\u2014behind her.You can never truly escape your hometown. Ten years after Corinne's disappearance, Nic returns to Cooley Ridge to help tie up some loose ends related to her ailing father, and get her childhood home into saleable condition. Since everyone else from her past still lives in Cooley Ridge, it's not long before she finds herself falling into familiar behavior patterns, revisiting old resentments, and picking at old wounds that she thought had healed.One night shortly after Nic's return, another young woman, Annaleise Carter, disappears. Annaleise was one of Nic's neighbors, and was dating her ex-boyfriend Tyler, and although she was younger than Nic and her friends, she was there the night that events occurred leading up to Corinne's disappearance. And apparently, Annaleise had recently shown a keen interest into that night 10 years ago.After the initial set-up, \nAll the Missing Girls\n is told backwards, from Day 15 to Day 1 following Nic's return home. She tries to unravel what happened to Annaleise, and also attempts to understand what happened to Corinne all those years ago, and the hold she had on those around her. Nic also must come to terms with things she and her family have kept hidden, and try to figure out what the next chapter of her life holds, while everything seems to be unraveling quickly.This book kept me hooked from start to finish. It reminded me of one of my favorite movies, \nMemento\n, which is also told backwards, and it's fascinating to see something referred to or see the aftermath of an event, and then read about what actually happened in the next (or technically, previous) chapter. Megan Miranda doesn't ease up on the tension, and I really wasn't sure what to expect. The plot is utterly fascinating even if it wasn't totally surprising to me, but all I wanted to do was keep reading.I mentioned a few reviews ago that it's difficult for me to read mysteries and thrillers because I've become so used to not trusting any characters. In the introduction to the book, it is mentioned that none of the characters are reliable narrators, so that lack of trust actually works here and doesn't distract. It's just really well done.For some reason the media marketing minds have decided to compare this to \nThe Girl on the Train\n, but I don't think they're similar, and I think this one is better. I look forward to seeing what comes next for Megan Miranda, because her talent makes her totally worthy of being another famous Miranda (along with \nHamilton\n genius Lin-Manuel Miranda).

Maybe the concept -- while clever -- didn't quite work for me. Maybe I'm just really finicky when it comes to thrillers -- I like some, but not many. All the Missing Girls is told from Nicolette's (Nic) perspective. When she was 18, her best friend disappeared and then Nic left town. Ten years later, she returns to her home town and another girl disappears. After a scene setting prologue, the book is told in reverse chronological order covering a 15 day time span in which what happened 10 years ago and now are slowly revealed. While the story and its telling were clever, I never felt particularly invested -- I really didn't find Nic sympathetic so I didn't feel a particularly pressing need to know what happened to the missing girls and to Nic. And I often felt like I spent too much time dwelling on the logic of the reverse chronological order. Having said that, I'm an outlier on this one. There are plenty of enthusiastic reviews, so don't take my word on this one -- as I say I'm really finicky when it comes to thrillers.

When Nicolette Farrell gets a phone call from her brother, Daniel, regarding the health of their father and the need to sell the family home, Nic, reluctantly agrees to come home to Cooley Ridge. A decade ago, Nic\u2019s best friend disappeared, upending everyone\u2019s lives forever. Nic is the only one of her friends to leave home, and forge a new life. But, now that she has returned, her past comes to roost in the present, when another young girl disappears, opening up old wounds, revealing stunning secrets, and churning up old memories, lost loves, jealousies, and hidden crimes. Before Nic can move forward with her life, she must discover the truth about what happened ten years ago, and find out what happened to her young neighbor, Annaleise. In the meantime, she floats between the past and present, struggling with memory, nostalgia, angst, but most of all she\u2019s afraid of how the past may affect her future, as her father, ex-boyfriend, Tyler, and her brother, are all under suspicion and every step she takes is being watched closely\u2026I loved the stylish presentation the author employed, which really challenged me and certainly staved off any hint of boredom. The story is told from Nicolette\u2019s POV, who takes us on a moody, atmospheric journey into her past, which will throw turn her carefully planned future into complete disarray. Nic was deeply affected by her friend\u2019s disappearance for many reasons, stirring up feelings of guilt and remorse, while her feelings for Tyler remains unsettled. To top things off, she must cope with the drain of her father\u2019s dementia, getting the house ready to sell, and the complicated relationship she has with her brother.  The new missing persons case, puts them all back on the old rumor mill, creating a renewed interest in the cold case. All of this creates an aura of edgy suspense, and produces a creepy, heavy feeling of foreboding, that had me sitting on pins and needles. The characters are all secretive, complex, and even a little dangerous, which made me wonder what they knew, what lies they had told, and why. No one is above suspicion! I can\u2019t say I felt a ginormous sense of peace once all was said and done, nor do I know exactly how to feel about how everything turned out in the end, but I did find the story absorbing, and immensely satisfying in a dark and twisty sort of way.I definitely get why this book is so popular and am thankful I finally got a copy, after months of waiting.

I listened to this on audio, narrated by the talented Rebekkah Ross. It begins with Nic (Nicolette) returning to her childhood home of Cooley Ridge because of her ailing father. Nic left Cooley Ridge ten years earlier, just after her best friend Corinne disappeared. Then suddenly, a decade later, another young woman goes missing - Annaleise, the girlfriend of Nic's high school boyfriend, Tyler. Could the two cases be related? Nic is frantic to find out the truth. The story is then told from Day 15 (after Nic's arrival in Cooley Ridge) to Day 1. The details of the women's disappearances are slowly revealed, as well as the major players in the mystery. Going backward, you're never quite sure what's already happened, what the characters already know, and who's reliable or not. It was a genius way to add to the suspense.

I love books about people within a close knit town. I love the rumors and lies, and the truths that are only known to a select few. The people in this type town aren\u2019t trapped there, but choose to remain in that world because it is theirs.\n\"People were like Russian nesting dolls \u2013 versions stacked inside the latest edition.

Just because something is suspenseful doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s anything like Girl on the Train. I\u2019m not saying this to be negative towards this book because I really liked it, even more than Girl on the Train. It\u2019s just annoying to see every book being compared to something that it is nothing like, short of being a suspenseful novel. #rantover hehe.\n\u201cI feel like the whole world is off balance.

Like there\u2019s this cliff and I don\u2019t even realize I\u2019m on the edge.\u201d\nI\u2019ve never read a book in reverse before and I wasn\u2019t really sure how it would turn out, but it worked well. I found myself trying to remember everything she said because it would probably show up in the day before and start to make more sense. This was such a unique way to tell this story. I loved the way I was trying to piece everything together since it has already happened. I\u2019m usually very good at figuring out twists or who did it, but this book had me wondering around every turn what was coming out next. I couldn\u2019t wait for the next piece I could hang on to for some clarity. All of the characters are unreliable.\n\u201cWe were a town full of fear, searching for answers.

It\u2019s a great concept that was thought out very well.\n\u201cThe house felt different. Unsafe, unknown, too many possibilities existing all at once.

I was trying to remember all the details that didn\u2019t make sense at the beginning of the book. Everything was starting to come together and it fit perfectly. I want to do a re-read and start with day one and go to day fourteen and see if it is as good told from the beginning instead of the end.

This book is told in a backwards to front format for the period of 14 days. So you start out with her going to this small down and arriving to her childhood home and then we go to the future and tell the story backwards.There are a slew of problems with this novel and I will attempt to delineate because I don't like to slap a one star on a book without cause or explaining. These are things that for me destroyed what could've been a really awesome story. From now there will be SPOILERS!1. Format: while I appreciate the concept of backwards to forward it doesn't work in this story because the fact is that Day 14 Nic details the events as if she didn't know what happened in Day 1. Does this make sense? So though we're telling the story backwards it's as if Nic didn't know what happened in the past. Information is withheld from days until the end which defeats the purpose of the backwards storytelling. This made the story extremely confusing.2. The Unreliable Narrator Trope from Hell: It's not that I do not like an unreliable narrator, I very much enjoy it but the problem here is that there are 2 types of unreliable narrators: the ones you don't know they're unreliable until the end and it blows you away because it was so well crafted that you almost want to read the story again to see what you missed, those are the awesome ones. Then there's this one. The ones you KNOW the entire time that they're holding shit back, that you can't trust anything they say, etc. There's a serious lack of elegance to this narration, Nic is a complete mess and you know it and it's frustrating because she's so sloppy in her narration. She's repetitive, unlikable, selfish, lying, weak, jumbled - she's everything that I dislike. She believes in the justification of her actions but at the same time condemns them. Also, the entire world view presented is that everyone is like her, deep inside, we're all just nasty people.3. The Lack of Likable Characters: When I tell you that not one of these motherfuckers are likable, I don't think I've ever experienced this before. In all books/movies there's always that one sympathetic character which you need, you need it to contrast the rest. In this narration not ONE is likable and mostly it's because you don't know anything about them. The characters in this story are just dimensions, they're interchangeable, they lack deep quirks and roots and things that make them come alive. Because our story is told by the hateful and bland Nic we see everyone through her eyes and thus they are reflective of her blandness.4. So Predictable: About 10% into this book I knew that A: all the chicks were dead and 2 that it was one of the 5 main characters. Now, this format has been done well before - for example Clue, the movie. If you've watched it you know one of the characters killed Mr. Body, maybe even more than one of them but it's done so flawlessly that by the end you love them all, even the killer(s). This book was the opposite. You wish they were all the killers and you wish they would all die.5. The Reader is an Idiot Trope: Oh, you know that book - the book that decides that you as a reader are a moron and you need to repeatedly be told plot points. This book is incredibly repetitive, you can literally skip from Day 10 to Day 4 and you'll be fine.6. The Nothing Happens Trope: Oh yes. Nothing actually happens except the last 50 pages and by then you would like to join in on the murder spree.Needless to say, I don't recommend this book."}, {"userName": "maymay\u2740", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49148508-maymay", "userReview": "this review is 20 years late, excuse my tardiness This book has everything you want in a thriller. A gripping beginning, a creepy aura, and a small town filled with secrets. And while all the components were present, the ending seemed to miss the mark for me. \u201cPeople were like Russian nesting dolls - versions stacked inside the latest edition. But they all still lived inside, unchanged, just out of sight.\u201d  All the Missing Girls  is told backwards, from Day 15 back to Day 1 \u2013 where sweet, quiet Annalise (the MCs neighbor) goes missing. Nicolette, the MC, works to try and unravel the mystery to her neighbours disappearance. But along the way, she learns some chilling secrets about her family, friends, and quiet little town. I will admit, though it was confusing, working backwards was absolutely thrilling. It enhanced that creepy aura that was already embedded into the plot and made everything much more covert. What fell flat for me?The ending. The big twist. The reveal. It was like . . . that\u2019s it??!!??I\u2019m not sure if many readers will agree with me, but in thrillers, the whole plot builds up to the last chapter that should freak the heck out of us, but in this book, it was like ??!!??!! OKAY, BUT WHY SO DUMB???!!!?In conclusion, great buildup, but the reveal was so anticlimactic I wanted to cri. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing I\u2019ve learned about leaving\u2014you can\u2019t really go back\u201d 3.5 stars!!"}, {"userName": "Jan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15865336-jan", "userReview": "I have no time for an in depth review as I'm moving, finding reading alone has been a challenge and I'd rather spend my time there. :)In a nutshell: This is a solid thriller that kept my attention and eagerly anticipating the ending. The story is told backwards, so I did have some confusion on the timeline of things and personally wish the story had been told in normal fashion. I don't think the backwards order added anything to the enjoyment of this read or to the suspense.The ending wraps up nicely...not sure that these characters deserved what they got, but I was still satisfied. Overall an enjoyable, thought-inducing thriller that I think any mystery lover connect with.My thanks to NetGalley for the ARC in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Veronica \u2b50\ufe0f", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6716390-veronica", "userReview": "All the Missing Girls is the first in a new series by Megan Miranda who has written several books for Young Adults. This is her first book for adults.Nic returns home to Cooley Ridge to help her brother ready the family home for sale. Their father is suffering dementia and now in a nursing home. The sale of the house is required to pay mounting bills. Once Nic arrived home it was like never leaving and the memories came flooding back. She\u2019d left the town 10 years ago after her friend Corrine disappeared without a trace. Two weeks on and Annaleise Carter goes missing, swallowed up by the woods, just like Corrine.The story is told in the first person by Nic, but we can see she is not telling it all, she is always guarded, holding back. (The unreliable narrator is a tried and true formula and Miranda uses it well in this story).Written in reverse chronological order from day 15 down to day 1 you really need to be paying attention with this twisty, breath-holding mystery which will have you second guessing all the way through.As the police start investigating the disappearance of Annaleise, Nic is still haunted by the disappearance of best friend Corrine 10 years earlier and goes over the details leading up to the event where personalities are laid bare and long held secrets divulged.I love a mystery where you are so sure that you have it all worked out and then BAM, you learn you had it all wrong.All the Missing Girls is a hauntingly compelling story written around the eerie backdrop of the woods of Cooley Ridge.This is a story you will want to read over again as soon as you\u2019ve finished the last page.I received a review copy from the publisher."}, {"userName": "Debra", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5032725-debra", "userReview": "3.5 starsOne really needs to pay attention while reading this book. This book is told in reverse chronological order ranging from day 15 to day 1. This is a very unique way of telling the story and it took some time for me to get used to this technique. Initially I did not like this about the book. I found it to be annoying and then I began to warm up to it. Nicolette (Nic) returns to her rural hometown after being gone for 10 years. She has returned to help her brother care for their ailing father and to help sell the family home and tie up loose ends. Ten years earlier her best friend, Corinne disappeared without a trace. At the time Nic, her brother Daniel, her boyfriend Tyler, and Corinne's boyfriend Jackson were considered suspects. Tyler's current girlfriend Annaleise provided them with an alibi at the time.Then Annaleise goes missing (in the present day). Nic begins to look at the past and tries to tie it together with the present day. The story has mystery, family secrets, relationship issues, and some twists and turns along the way. Overall, I thought this book was good. It was one that I initially gave less stars to, but then I found myself sitting and thinking about it. Then I realized I enjoyed the book more than I thought I would. I think I was initially thrown by the reverse storytelling. I don't think this technique is for everyone. Some may even find it to be confusing.See more of my reviews at www.openbookpost.com"}], "description": "Like the spellbinding psychological suspense in The Girl on the Train and Luckiest Girl Alive, Megan Miranda\u2019s novel is a nail-biting, breathtaking story about the disappearances of two young women\u2014a decade apart\u2014told in reverse.It\u2019s been ten years since Nicolette Farrell left her rural hometown after her best friend, Corinne, disappeared from Cooley Ridge without a trace.
