PLEASE, if you do read this book, read it as an opportunity to educate yourself against the Christian movement towards puntitive discipline, control and breaking of a child's spirit.

I mention this truism because most of the criticism of this book is on the spiritual content (stemming from non-Christians, seemingly), and not on the ACTUAL apparent content of the book, e.g., bringing up boys. if you are someone who disagrees with the assertions that Christianity and the bible make about morality, homosexuality, the traditional family unit, male/female differences and strengths, and making religion the center of raising a child, then this book is not for you--even though it's right.having a 1.5 year old boy as of this review, I found myself really needing guidance about how to raise him up to be a godly man and a good person. I had good parents, but probably not great ones, and I often feel under-prepared and overwhelmed when I think about what I have or don't have to give to my son. I am familiar with Dobson, and knew that this book would at the very least get me in the ballpark. Dobson is a good writer and strikes a good balance of information as a psychologist, Christian, and father. sometimes it seems that Dobson only had an example because he felt like it fit within his book outline, and there are times when his stories or examples had nothing to do with the subject at hand, and he even admitted it a few times. that made the reading a little odd. the other thing that I have to say is that he seems to really be a \"traditionalist\" when it comes to the family and the roles in the family, and i'm not opposed to this, per se, but since my family isn't traditional (I stay at home with my kids while my wife works), I really wanted to hear his argument for this. but the best thing you get is that \"the bible says it\", or something similar to that. which is not how he cites everything else in the book. I found most of the book well researched, but there are a few times--like his traditional statements--which seemed really unsupported by reason, citation, and scripture, even though he SAID it was. most of his content is very good, and the general thing I took away from it was really just how important my role as a father is in shaping my son's life, and that I need to always be mindful of that and seek God for wisdom in what I do and say. but really, that's about the only thing I took from this book. I can't ding it for major flaws, but I will say that reading this book wasn't all that illuminating for me. most of it was common sense and only reinforced my beliefs as a Christian dad. I do recommend it, and i'm going to read more from Dobson, and will read the Bringing Up Girls sequel too."}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/185664-kelly", "userReview": "We got this as a gift -- it isn't a book I would have sought out. It's kind of funny -- I brought up this book at Thanksgiving dinner at the in-laws and my ultra-Conservative right wing SIL scoffed at it! Anyhow, Dobson's views on parenting are way too colored by his political views. If I listen to him my sons are going to grow up to be homosexual because my husband is out of town too much and I take on the lion's share of the parenting. Yeah, I'll make a note about that. (Hey -- by that view, are lesbians formed because their moms left the bulk of the parenting to the dads? Was the mom out pursuing her career as a Mary Kay saleswomen, leading to gay daughters? Hm. That'd make a good novel. A mom blames her daughter's alternative lifestyle on the tragic pursuit of a pink cadillac.)The ONE thing that saves this book from the trash heap is the observation that the traditional classroom structure was designed by women teachers for the benefit of girls' learning styles.

I LOVE it! It has just affirmed what I know to be true: that my husband is a MAN, a REAL man (who I love to death), and that raising a boy is so important (not that raising a girl is unimportant, but if you read the book, you'll understand that it's just really different).This is not my point to this post. It is actually about why we feel disconnected to others. I'm sure if we dig deep down, we all know that it is - in part - due to technology. We keep up with people on Facebook, email, MySpace, text messaging, etc, etc.He says it a lot better than I can. \"Are you one of these harried women running in endless circles? Have you found yourself too busy to read a good book or take a long walk with your spouse or hold your three-year-old child on your lap while telling him or her a story? Have you taken time to study God's Word - to commune with Him and listen to His gentle voice? Have you eliminated almost every meaningful activity in order to deal with the tyranny of a never-ending \"to do\" list? Have you ever asked yourself why in the world you have chosen to live like this?....When was the last time you had friends drop by unexpectedly for a visit?...There was a time when families made a regular habit of packing into the car and driving over to a friend's home for an afternoon of good conversation and a piece of banana-cream pie. It was one of life's special little pleasures...I'll never forget the times as a boy when I would hear a knock on the door...and a familiar voice would echo through the house, \"Is anybody home?\"...Sadly, that kind of spontaneous camaraderie is difficult to achieve in today's fast-paced world. The pressures and busyness of life have all but destroyed the sense of community that was once common among families and friends We seldom - if ever - drop in on friends unannounced. And even if we did, they would probably have to cancel a string of appointments in order to be with us. Thus, we go about our days, careening through life, glancing at our watches, and wondering why we don't have very many close friendships.\"Wow. I remember friends of my parents calling out, \"anyone home?\" or my parents doing that at my grandparents' homes. I have never done that - well, not since college when I lived in the dorms. We schedule and make appointments with friends. Part of this is that friends live a distance from us. Many of us, I think, probably don't know our neighbors well. Our friends live far enough away that we need to drive to their house, and we know how busy they are so we ask when a good time to call is rather than just calling.When was the last time you dropped in on a friend?

In reading the first chapter, I recognized the author and realized that his ideas were likely to be more conservative than my own. But hey, I'm a mom and I'm a Christian, so I kept an open mind. The first few chapters made me raise a few eyebrows, but almost in a good way. It made me think about my own values and question my ideas about the family and my role as a mother. I figured that even if I didn't wholeheartedly agree with everything Dobson was saying, examining my own ideas is always a good thing. But once I was about 30% into the book, I was getting annoyed. There was nothing helpful or even specific being said about the day to day raising of boys, just generalities about the structure of the family. And I found it poorly written at that, and poorly organized. And he continually did one of my biggest pet peeves - mentioning something, then saying he'll talk about it more fully in another chapter. He also quoted himself from his other books, which I found annoying.But then I got to the chapter on preventing homosexuality, and it just made me sick. I had to stop reading. I guess I will never know if there was ANYTHING helpful in the book because the I can't give weight or credit to any of his ideas because his views as espoused in that chapter are just a deal breaker for me.

Several people had recommended this book to me. When I bought Bringing Up Boys, I was hoping to gain insight into raising my little one. Based on the recommendations I received, I thought the book would give advice on how to raise boys in different situations. I was greatly disappointed. Instead of advice, the book was filled with Dr. Dobson's personal opinions about parenting - most with which I disagreed. I am a Christian, but I found Dr. Dobson's views to be very narrow-minded and one-sided. One of the most discouraging aspects of the book was Dr. Dobson's view on motherhood. I was hoping he would give suggestions for how mothers can develop close relationships with their sons. I was VERY disappointed to discover that the two chapters dedicated to motherhood in Bringing Up Boys were devoted to explaining why women should stay at home with their children! Don't get me wrong - I firmly believe motherhood is one of the most important roles a woman can have. As a teacher, I have also seen how broken family relationships and absent parents can negatively impact children. But as a working mom, I resent the implication that I am somehow failing to fulfill my God-given responsibility by NOT staying home with my son.

Some of his views may be a bit right wing, even for me. However, no one can deny the cold hard facts he lays before his readers in Bringing Up Boys.Dobson scientifically analyzes biological data, he compares Christian perspective with secular world views/perspectives and he manages to do it all in a loving grandfatherly sort of way. His critics felt attacked by his book--I felt challenged. Yeah, so maybe he quoted mostly from Christian authors/personalities to support his views; but what do you expect? He is the leading Christian Psychologist in the US! And besides, he did manage to pull very convincing truths from a non-Christian columnist (pp202), so there!When all is said and done, I learned an awful lot about boys/men from Dobson.

None really; I was just curious. You see, I wanted to get a different perspective, but I wasn't interested in changeing my views. (Thankfully) I must say that Dobson's by no means the worst writer ever to call the Earth home, and there have been other books churned out of the Christian Conservative campy that are substantially more out-there. You can tell he's sincere in his intentions, and he has Hence, I've gotta give him a handshake where a handshake is due. This is no masterpiece, of course. Dobson isn't William F. Buckley when it comes to authoring good,well-written books that promote traditional ideals; he's obviously not an intellectual, and his craftmanship abilities at writeing are in every way limited. Other then this, some of the beliefs in Bringing Up Boys have more holes then Spongebob. A good example of this is a chapter on homosexualty. Dobson doesn't even go into the point of varition in regards to sexualtiy that occur in animals, and he seems oblivous to the anthropolgical evidence of homosexuality's existence since the dawn of man as well as numerous biological similarties among gay men. There are more examples of this, obviously. Because of this, I can't recomend Bringing Up Boys for anyone;I simply disagree with everything Dobson has to say.

I had never heard of this Dr. James Dobson person (hi, apparently I live in a cave), and I thought it would simply help me understand the minds of dudes a little better since I'm pregnant with a boy and have always felt like I don't \"get\" boys.My friend had told me the book was perhaps more religious or conservative than I would normally read, so I figured I'd take Dobson's views with a grain of salt. Now that I'm about 1/4 of the way through the book, I'm thinking it's time to abandon that plan. I'm not at all enjoying this negative talk of \"the feminists\", for one thing, and it's starting to look like Dobson is about to tell me all the things I should do to keep my son from becoming gay, because, you know, that's (a) so horrible and (b) so controllable and (c) so everyone's parents' fault. And then I finally decided to google \"Focus on the Family\" since this Dobson person heads that group up and I could have sworn I'd heard of them but wasn't sure what I'd heard about them (see above re: living in a cave) and, um, yeah, my views REALLY don't align with these folks.

He speaks with, what I suppose he thinks is, an air of Christianity that, in reality, comes off as an air of superiority. His viewpoints are not very Christian-like, despite numerous testimonies and scripture throughout the book. I feel the need to point out that I am a Catholic, and I love God. I just expect more from someone who is supposed to be well-educated, Christian or not.Feminists and homosexuals are his biggest targets to the downfall of masculinity. He rants about the feminist movement, only giving a brief sentence of acknowledgement that at the time it started women had no \"equal pay, for equal work\" and endured sexual harassment more often than men in the workplace. However, he later goes on to blame feminists for men not being able to be firm in business anymore because they have to fear a woman making false claims about harassment and losing their jobs.Now, I'm not saying that's never happened, but do we live on the same planet Dr. Dobson? He blames high divorce rates on the feminist movement as well, but never cites how difficult it was for women at that time to get out of highly abusive relationships. I'd expect at least that from a doctor of psychology. His viewpoints on homosexuality are very one sided. He only links articles and studies that support his viewpoint, ignoring all other evidence. He gives advice throughout the book on how to avoid turning your child into a wild, hateful, homosexual adolescent, and then let's you know that you can do everything right and still have that outcome. He cites, and seems to agree with, a viewpoint that mothers are basically unneeded by a boy by the time they reach age of somewhere between 3-5 (fathers are more important from that point forward), and then goes on later to say that having a stay-at-home mother (if you can afford it) is essential in the home to keep your children, but especially boys, on track and out of trouble. This is just one example of how he seems to lean in more than one direction on a subject.Finally, I do have to give credit to Chapter 15. I agree with most of what he says in that area, a good portion of it dedicated to telling parents that it isn't so much what you give your child, but more so how you spend time with your child. I've always believed that time and love supersedes things.Unfortunately, one chapter is not enough to save the word-vomit that was this book.

Dr. Dobson is prejudiced and allows this book to be a tool to advance his propaganda for anti-feminism, submission, and male dominance. He spoke constantly about the \"feminist agenda\" to turn our young boys gay. I have two problems with the argument by Dr. Dobson. The first is that contrary to his personal beliefs - the \"agenda\" of feminists is to promote equality among the sexes, i.e., valuing the overall worth of a woman as integral to society, beyond being a helper for her man or man child. Feminists desire to see women adored instead of ogled, respected instead of objectified, and advanced instead of being held back. They work toward affording women comparable opportunities within the workplace. Dr. Dobson, on the contrary, believes that feminism is somehow tearing families in general, and young boys in particular, apart. Secondly, he writes that boys are wired differently from girls and this \"difference\" is evident even at birth through the formative years and no amount of persuading will change them. He continues by saying that boys are born with romantic feelings toward the opposite sex, though these feelings do not usually manifest until several years later. However, he believes that gay boys become that way as a result of feminist intervention. Not only is it contradictory, but utterly untrue that \"normal\" boys and girls are born with a desire toward the opposite sex, but gay boys became that way because of the subtle (or not so subtle) propaganda spewed by rebellious, competitive, ungodly women. Additionally, he admonishes women to return to their proper place, in the home, instead of \"rushing back to the workforce after only 6 weeks after childbirth.\" As a \"man of God\" I expect Dr. Dobson to be more sympathetic to the hardships many women face; yet, he merely adds to their burden. I attempted to remain open-minded during the entire 6 disc audiobook, but had tremendous difficulty ascribing to the antiquated, traditionalist point of view of the author.

They are obviously non Christians who hate anything that involves Jesus. Honestly, that is fine. However, if they want to hate Jesus that is their choice however, why pick up a known Christian author's book? Obviously James Dobson is a christian author & if you didn't know this then you should have done a little research. So because he IS a christian obviously he's going to be discussing parenting & how we as christians are supposed to be raising our children. If you want a non christian's view on how to bring up your children then I'd suggest reading a NON christian's book, duh. No where in the book did Dobson insinuate any 'hate' towards homosexuals. In fact, I was actually *surprised* how accepting he was of them. I say I was surprised because I know he's an older man who was brought up years ago back when homosexuality was more hushed & frowned upon. I really thought he'd be somewhat condemning of the lifestyle just because he is an old man however I was refreshed to see that he sees homosexuals as God sees them..with love! It's the sin God doesn't like & He still loves the sinner. There was no point in Dobson's book where he came off as hating the homosexual. He was very gentle & loving when he mentioned how to help them if they wanted out of the lifestyle. I'm sorry people but you aren't born gay. It's a lifestyle you choose to participate in. No one was ever born gay.Non christians can think what they want and try to say otherwise but I'm a bible believer & in the bible God spoke of homosexuality being an abomination/sin. God didn't create sin so He didn't create people born gay, sorry folks!Anyways, I would definitely recommend this book to parents who are christians or to non christians who are open to christian parenting/views. I thought Dobson had a lot of worthwhile things to say..especially about how our gov't is dumbing down society & why kids are turning out worse now than ever before.Our public schools are complete crap & teach crap, most parents now are too busy with work or themselves to take an interest in their child's life & development & neglect them. The kids in turn learn from what they see at school (which is usually crap), mimic what they see on tv or in video games, etc. To me this book makes complete sense.I'm surprised so many people gave it negative reviews & 1 star. This book definitely hit the nail on the head & really made some things I already knew but wasn't completely focused on more important to me & I know I need to take action on some things in how I parent my son."}, {"userName": "Audra", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2015709-audra", "userReview": "It's a good book, with lots of useful tips. I borrowed a copy, and found myself wishing I could highlight passages, so I guess that tells me I wish I owned it? Some of the material seemed more geared toward parents of older boys, not really the toddler/little boy set, but all underscored the importance of consistent parenting, especially on the part of the father. One detraction was that he didn't really have much to offer in the way of hope or encouragement for single moms, or those whose husbands are often absent (military, men working multiple jobs so Mom can stay home, etc). As an example, particularly disheartening was the conflicting advice that, given the prevalence of child abuse today, parents should try not to let children out of their sight, even at church, and should never leave their kids alone with teenaged boys. However, single moms needed to reach out to their community and find strong male role models for their boys. While I see where he is coming from with both of those statements, and I think there is truth in both of them, on the surface, it makes an already daunting task seem impossible. I would say it is a worthwhile read, and is PACKED with statistics and information, but if one is looking for hope and encouragement for the task at hand, I still love and highly recommend Meg Meeker's book, \"Boys Should Be Boys.\""}, {"userName": "Sharran", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2618451-sharran", "userReview": "I wanted to get this as a gift for a friend of mine who found out she was pregnant with a boy. I am glad I listened to it first because it did not turn out being what I thought it was going to be. James Dobson seems to focus on the extremes such a what causes boys to have a higher chance of becoming criminals and homosexuals. I was looking for practical advice on how a mother should interact and relate to her boy (especially for someone who doesn't have brothers, and this is her first child, etc.). Only one chapter in the first half of the book was devoted to this subject and did give some great practical advice. I just thought the whole book was going to be about this. Therefore, I stopped listening halfway through the book because I was very convinced this was not the book I was looking for. I did not get this for my friend and will keep looking. Good information, just not on the topic I was looking for."}, {"userName": "Stephanie Lawton", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2443512-stephanie-lawton", "userReview": "This is absolutely one of the most influential books I've ever read. Make no mistake, Dobson is EXTREMELY conservative, even for me, and I'm pretty right leaning. However, much of what he said, not just about boys, but about society in general, rings true. There are chapters on the degeneration of society and mini history lessons about things you've always heard of, but weren't alive for or old enough to understand the ramifications -- like the feminist movement, postmodernism, the rise of the porn industry, etc. This is an absolute must-read for anyone with children or grandchildren or for anyone concerned about the state of society and toll it's taking on kids ... and the future generation of men. I will be buying copies of this for Christmas presents for friends/family with boys."}, {"userName": "Sharon Cartwright", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2691253-sharon-cartwright", "userReview": "Not what I was hoping for so far. At page 50, we've discussed how when boys get to teenage years it is best to just get through it rather than solve the problems. Now on teenage violence, suicide and murder. It's an important topic, but not one that concerns me on a person level. I'm hanging in there ...page 100 or so. I am deeply disturbed by this book. On some topics, I'm in full agreement like teaching your children to love God, the importance of a parent at home, on others I think his advice is very stereotypical and not a fit for us. Not in favor of boys showing emotions, playing with traditionally girl's toys, or mothers bonding with boys over preschool age."}, {"userName": "Kitkat", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22213818-kitkat", "userReview": "I am 1/2 way through the book so far and I am really enjoying it! He raises a lot of good points that I think many people just honestly don't want to hear in this day and age. I am a working mother and I am not offended by he says and the message that he is trying to get across to parents. I read some past reviews and I think some readers need to calm down and just realize that he is writing through a Christian perspective and if you don't agree fine, but keep in mind his main point is to bring up good gentlemen...something that I see seriously lacking in today's society. I am very interested to read the rest of his book and I hope more mothers and fathers do. Good job Dr. Dobson! :)"}], "description": "2002 Gold Medallion Award winner!
