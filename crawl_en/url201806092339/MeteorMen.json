Are these extra-terrestrials peaceful or hostile? They\u2019re actually peaceful but the US Military knows one goddamn thing \u2013 it\u2019s got some goddamn missiles and it\u2019s gonna goddamn use them!As everyone freaks out about an alien invasion that isn\u2019t happening because the aliens are too busy walking on air (literally!) as if they\u2019re stoned superheroes who\u2019ve just figured out their powers, one alien befriends lonely American teen Alden Baylor, a kid whose name sounds like someone with a mouthful of toffee trying to say \u201cAlan Taylor\u201d.You\u2019d think he was miserable because of his crap name, or maybe because that\u2019s the attitude that works best on the laydees but he\u2019s not getting any, for some reason, even though he resembles an Abercrombie & Fitch model with no parents to tell him what to do and a massive amount of land he\u2019s just inherited, plus media attention. (That said, can a teenager own land? I don\u2019t know the US laws but doesn\u2019t seem right)Middle middle middle, terrible anticlimactic ending, stare into space wondering what the point was, and it\u2019s over.Meteor Men is probably the least interesting aliens come to Earth storyline you\u2019ll ever read. Our \u201chero\u201d archetype, Alden, might as well have empty speech bubbles for all its worth reading his dialogue. He\u2019s the most vacuous person to have as a main character and there should be a sign hanging around his neck saying \u201cWARNING: Listening to me talk for any amount of time will put you a coma\u201d.The aliens are criminally dull too. I\u2019m sure the idea that when aliens invade, the reader is supposed to be interested in finding out who they are and why they\u2019re here but they do so little and display such little character \u2013 they\u2019re like alien versions of Alden \u2013 that you\u2019ve all but given up on them proving to be in the least bit worth knowing. I can say having read it, the reason why they do what they do is one of the most mind-numbingly boring reveals ever.The book overall has a strong Spielberg-ian feel to it. The kid who makes friends with the alien and the government/military hunting them down clich\u00e9 is very ET and the fact that the comic is aimed at younger readers makes it a very safe read. Nothing original is attempted, there are no complex themes or characters, there\u2019s little in the way of tension or obstacles to overcome, and the message is as universally positive as you can get \u2013 don\u2019t judge appearances and be tolerant and kind to others. A fine sentiment but bland as hell \u2013 sorry, kids \u2013 \u201check\u201d, to read.Maybe that\u2019s why the book has no resonance with me, being an adult reader, and teenagers will lap this up? It does seem to portray the life of a teenager fairly accurately \u2013 the awkwardness of a shy boy around girls, the parties, etc. - so perhaps for a reader going through these things themselves, they\u2019ll identify more closely with the protagonist (who is luckily a blank slate \u2013 maybe that was the point?) and feel more strongly about the book as a result.Sandy Jarrell\u2019s artwork is pretty good \u2013 I liked how the alien first spoke to Alden psychically, the background was whited out with a giant word to show how big an impact it had on his mind, and overall the comic is easy on the eyes. The alien designs aren\u2019t that original though and seem fairly generic and forgettable.And those two words sum up Meteor Men \u2013 generic and forgettable. At no point was I engaged with any aspect of the narrative and the most powerful feeling I had when reading it was sleepiness. Maybe a teen who hasn\u2019t read much sci-fi will enjoy this, but for the rest of us? It\u2019s a miss. Like the meteors in the book when they lay on the ground split open, Meteor Men is quite hollow."}, {"userName": "Wayne McCoy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4054541-wayne-mccoy", "userReview": "'Meteor Men' is a perfect story for the graphic novel format. It's mystery and wonder are perfect for this medium. Some slight spoilers follow.Alden Baker lives on his deceased parent's farm until he's old enough to own it. On the night of the Perseid meteor shower, he and others are out in the pasture to observe it. Along with the shower, meteors crash on Earth, including not far from where he is. A fight ensues over who owns the meteor, but what are they really and why did so many land? The mystery deepens over weeks as mysterious things are seen on the planet, and Alden finds himself in a unique place in the middle of a global crisis.The art and story work well together, and it's the kind of visual story that works better with sequetial art. It's a good story completely suitable for YA. Alden is a likeable character. There are some strange jumps in the story. Some are possibly because of the story, but some were just a bit strange to me. I liked it well enough and I do recommend it.I received a review copy of this graphic novel from Diamond Book Distributors, Oni Press and NetGalley.

Aliens come to earth in a meteor shower and co-opt human bodies for their use. Fairly typical or at least as typical as sci-fi can be and certainly more than a little boring. The most interesting parts of the story are brief tidbits about Alden Baylor\u2019s history and previously mundane life. Yes, that\u2019s right; the mundane parts are about as exciting as it gets. The author appears to be trying to make a grand statement about human aggression, violence, and even our existence, but the effort falls flat. The character development and plot are too abrupt to make readers feel much sympathy or even dislike for either the humans or the aliens. I kept reading thinking there had to be more revealing information and excitement further on in the plot. Unfortunately, the ending was as quick and abrupt as the rest of the book and left me feeling like the story was unresolved and underdeveloped.Thanks to Netgalley.com for this ARC in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Kay", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6920736-kay", "userReview": "[Alden's choice to \"merge\" with a Meteor Man/alien parisite was supposed to be peaceful and bigger than himself -like Wilton was saying, that his memories would live on in the future with the parisite- but I just really didn't like it.

Rated 4.5 of 5It is books like Meteor Men that have restored my faith in the graphic novel as a literary form. \u00a0This book is beautiful to look at and delightful to read. \u00a0To me, this is precisely what the graphic novel medium is intended to be. \u00a0I know that the bulk of the graphic novels out there are compilations of superhero comic books, but the more I've been reading lately, the more I really appreciate the non-superhero graphic novels. \u00a0A book such as this might be just the ticket to get the young adult/teen readers in to the graphic novel market.The story is a rather basic 'first contact' story. \u00a0A group of teens gather to watch the annual meteor shower only this year it appears that one has struck the earth. \u00a0Bright, loner Alden discovers that the meteor has landed on his property. \u00a0After exploring and experimenting with the meteor, he intends to give it to a local museum. \u00a0But when Alden learns that similar meteors have struck the earth all over the world and there are coinciding reports of disappearances of local people, Alden realizes that there may be more to this than a random meteor. \u00a0When Alden discovers and befriends an alien, neither Alden, nor the Earth, will ever be the same.The story flows so naturally and author Jeff Parker not only creates an interesting and page-turning story, but he has also created unique, distinct, and involved characters. \u00a0Even our minor characters here have more personality and depth than some of the long-runnig superheroes I've read lately! \u00a0And while it's a teen-type book, the adults are not always the villians here.The art is really delightful. \u00a0Appropriate and effective and the sort of book you might thumb through just to look at the art.This is one of those books which I didn't know what to expect when I requested it from NetGalley and it turned out to be a beautiful surprise. \u00a0This is highly recommended to graphic novel fans and teen readers.Looking for a good book? \u00a0Meteor Men is a beautiful graphic novel with compelling characters and a strong story."}, {"userName": "Nicola Mansfield", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1682713-nicola-mansfield", "userReview": "This is a strong piece of pure science fiction (something I don't come across often enough these days). Aliens arrive on Earth during a meteor storm and the author brings a mature variation on the alien invasion theme. I found this to be a quick read and a story I was quickly hooked on. Usually when aliens arrive on earth one of two things happen: the aliens are bad and earth has to find the elusive way to kill them or the friendly, peace-loving aliens are misunderstood by the bad army/government people who want to kill them just because they are alien. I enjoyed Parker's take here as neither the aliens nor the authority figures are so easy to understand. We don't find out the alien objective until the end, which has a wonderful twist ending that leaves you thinking whether it was good or bad. Quite impressive. The art was excellent. Done realistically with a variety of frame structures that enhances the text."}, {"userName": "Kevin", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/674412-kevin", "userReview": "One night during the Perseid meteor shower, thousands of meteorites make contact all over planet Earth. One of those meteorites crashes in the farm of young Alden Baylor. After investigating, he makes contact with an alien that came down inside the meteorite. What does the alien want? Is it peaceful? These and many more questions are ones that both Alden and the world's ever-twitchy and defensive governments and militaries would like answered. It's not the best alien invasion story I've read but it's also not the worst. Sure, that might not sound like I'm giving it much credence. But I just felt it was a bit choppy and rushed. It had a lot of potential that was squandered by the conciseness of it. But I did breeze through it in one hour which is the quickest I've torn through a graphic novel.

After he heard I was a librarian he showed me a copy and thought it would be good for teens. Fast forward two years later and ComiXology has it on their unlimited service!This was a quick read; I almost finished it in one sitting. For the most part it feels like a typical \"boy meets alien\" story. The last bit of the 4th issue makes it stand out a little bit and definitely by the end it feels more unique. The art is nice. I enjoy the colors and the thick lines that give it more of an iconic look. It was a good quick read but I'm glad I didn't spend any money on it specifically.

But I'm sure plenty of others will enjoy it. This was just the weirdest alien species premise ever! They look like octopi but then morph and completely cover their host living being (usually a human) so they end up looking like humans just with big heads. Anyway, it never was adequately explained why Alden was connected to the aliens when no one else was, and I was confused as to why some people could hear the aliens thoughts and then later only Alden could. Also, they kept mentioning Alden's four cows so I was convinced they were going to be an important part of the plot.

I suppose that's an Earth-centric view; if you step outside of humanity and look at the story from the wider universe's perspective, or from that of the alien invaders, there's certainly a sense of community. But at what cost? The conclusion seems to be that humans don't really deserve to maintain our hold on this planet when our instinct is to destroy the unusual rather than attempting to understand it.It's an interesting book to read after (belatedly) watching Arrival, because it starts off with a similar idea but follows a quite different path. I don't know that it feels totally complete to me. It's a sliver of a story, with insufficient attention given to laying out the relationships between the important characters. It makes the conclusion feel less rational to me. I don't see this as a story of a teenager finding his place in the world; I don't think the aliens are strictly evil, but they're still a parasitic invading force that plans to eventually populate the entire universe, which requires displacing the existing inhabitants. That's not exactly making them any better than the trigger-happy government officials on Earth.I also didn't see Alden's final choice as one he made when in full possession of his faculties.

I was greatly reminded of the movie \"The Iron Giant\" due to this title's distinct style, sense of adventure and wonder, underlying message, and appeal for both children and adults. If but for a somewhat abrupt ending, this would be a perfect title.Story: When a group of kids go outside to see a yearly meteor shower, they are stunned when one of the meteors lands nearby. Alden, a somewhat lonely and introspective tween, saw the meteor land on his property and tracked it down. What he and the other kids find is a meteorite, split in half, and hollow in the center. Soon, Alden discovers that meteors landed all across the world and both educational and government entities want the meteor fragment on his property. Then Alden sees an alien - and he realizes there was a reason the center of the meteor was empty. Suddenly, everything changes as he begins to communicate with the alien, discovery a fearful truth about their reason to be on Earth, fend off the government, and fight to retain control of the meteorite.The art was beautifully rendered in full color and clean line drawings. It was so perfectly suited for the story that I could not imagine any other artist doing more justice to the plot. I was hooked from the very beginning of the story and could not put it down; I had to see what adventure the author was going to take me on with main character Alden. Although it may seem Alden is the 'hero' of the story, there are actually several characters who interact with him and, for once, the adults are not always the enemy. The underlying messages means this is a book you'll want to read several times.The story felt very original and the author made some very interesting moral observations that didn't club the reader over the head. Alden isn't a wide-eyed innocent and has to think his way through the plot. That he is older and has to deal with teen drinking and the death of his parents mark this as a much more mature story than with The Iron Giant movie. The author builds the mystery slowly and assuredly and the book never drags in the middle.This is an excellent graphic novel featuring sophisticated art and an original story. Although the ending felt a bit abrupt, the story had a defined arc and completed within this volume. This is one of those rare books without pretension and whose story appeals to many ages and genres.Reviewed from an ARC."}, {"userName": "Zach Dionne", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22508069-zach-dionne", "userReview": "Pretty straightforward alien landing/only the kid knows what's up story (and largely drawn/written with similar straightforwardness) but reminded me a lot of Arrival by the end, in that it suddenly became something very uniquely special and genuinely touching/thought-provoking toward the very end."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3345952-jessica", "userReview": "I can't really pinpoint exactly what it is about Meteor Men that I liked, even though I've been thinking about for a little over a day now. If I had to take a guess, I'd say it's the fact that this graphic novel captured my imagination. I'm sure we've all had moments where we wonder if we're alone in the universe. Where we truly debate what would happen if we weren't. More than anything, I felt like this story was something different from tales of aliens I've read previously, and I appreciated that wholeheartedly.Let's start with the illustrations since, in all honesty, those were my least favorite part of this story. It's not that the panels in Meteor Men aren't well done. They're just a different art style than I'm used to. The scenes were a bit blurry looking, with starkly contrasted speech bubbles hovering over them. On the bright side, it did make for a very easy read. The dialogue doesn't hide within the panels. Still, I'm used to bright, crisp art in my graphic novels. It made this one a little distracting.On to the story line, shall we? That was my favorite part of this, hands down. I loved that the aliens arrival was so spectacular. That there were no flashy UFOs or mother ships. I also really enjoyed the reactions of the general public. This story felt true to life as I followed along. I won't spoil, but there are a lot of grey areas explored in this novel. What if the aliens that came to Earth didn't fall into a \"bad\" or \"good\" category? What if there was something in between? Any story that challenges me to think outside the box gets a seal of approval from me, and this one did just that.There's not really much else that I can say about Meteor Men. I'm sure it's going to be a graphic novel that people either fall in love with, or pass over.

Some expected circumstances arise (the politics of an alien invasion, other accidents caused by a species that doesn't understand humans) but the aliens, themselves, provoke some unique insight. Rather than a group of individual creatures, all of the alien beings share a mental link and a history that goes back in time for ages.

The way the story was told through the arts was an artistic experience. The drawings were undoubtly very good. My favorite was the backgrounds! It was very stunning that I wanted to frame it. The colors were also neat and picturesque.There weren't many characters involved in this story, and most of them were forgetable. It was focussed on Alden and the alien's relationship.

It's been noted that orphans make great book characters for juvenile literature because they are able to do so much without parental interference, but it seems quite unlikely here.Like many graphic novels, it's difficult to figure out the setting, since there's only dialogue--an inserted \"Back at home...\"-type of information would have helped clarify this.

Meteor Men is a tale that crashes into your sensibilities, and reminds readers that wonder and awe can still be found within ourselves as well as the stars."}], "description": "On a summer night, Alden Baylor sits in a field watching the largest meteor shower in human history.
