I was always waiting for Vlad to appear, but he does only almost at the end of the book.Ok, his appearance, as always, very evil!We always can expect for the worst of him! He is pure evil!But I think the writer got sooo into it, in Vlad's cruelty, that I think the resolution of Glynis' freedom, was very poor. Glynis prefer to die than live with him, and that was the only point to make him leave her, finally! A very disappointing conclusion. But, at least, she finally got a happy ending."}, {"userName": "VampireNovelFan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4897902-vampirenovelfan", "userReview": "I want I want I want!"}, {"userName": "bunn3hh4x", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19811423-bunn3hh4x", "userReview": "[First 70% of the book felt more like filler/fluff and was relatively predictable. Honestly, the majority of the book was predictable but I read too much of this stuff to be surprised anymore :(. When the actual confrontation/struggle with Dracula occurs is where this series really shines (ie: Book 1 was incredibly dark and intense 90% of the time, book 2 was not as good until the end and now book 3 suffered the same fate as the second). I think what bothered me most about this book was having to wade through everything else when I half expected it to take up where the second left off. Even the darn release date was the same day as the end of book 2!!! I felt the whole situation with the Baroness could have been a separate novella instead of in the third and regrettably final book. I was glad that Glynis got her relatively and somewhat obligatory happy ending with her \"twice\" new family (*SLAPS Laura*) but the end still left me wanting to know WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?! She's suppose to add new vampires to the House of Wright and that could be all kinds of excitement for more books! Dracula walking away because of her attempted suicide just felt empty and then to be off with some Austrian Princess doing... we don't know what... just left me feeling more unsatisfied. Maybe he could have relented to give her space so that he could try to claim her again in another hundred years or so? What if he pretended to release the bond so that he could still follow her to England? Any number of things would have been better than \"awww you tried to kill yourself to get away from me so you are like my former wife who did kill herself so go away!\"I don't love the series because it is lovey dovey but because it is dark, gritty and full of emotional and physical struggle. When Glynis is at the mercy of Dracula the author really makes you feel that struggle, that intense and passionate hate but when she is surrounded by the other characters I just feel annoyed and I really want to slap her every time she \"stomps her foot\" like a toddler with a tantrum.Maybe Rhiannon can be convinced to write the series from Dracula's perspective next or possibly an alternate ending where he wins, or ends up in England, maybe goes after another wife, something! Probably barking up the wrong tree on that since she said it was the final book in the series/saga :(Sigh.In short: It could have been better but it was still a good read.

Lament of the Vampire Bride brings Glynis' story arc to an end in as satisfying manner. Recommended to anyone who liked the series.BUT in all honesty I must admit that the book has a (surprising) flaw. About 80% of the book is evenly paced. \u2013 It's similar to the previous book in the series, but might even be a bit slower (but this is good!). But then the story suddenly feels like it's on fast-forward and drops you off at to the end of the story. You almost feel like \"Nooo! I'm missing about 200 pages of goodness here!\"That said - if you enjoy the series you can't afford to miss it."}, {"userName": "Amber", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22846053-amber", "userReview": "I enjoyed the book and think it was a good ending. So far I've enjoyed pretty much everything Frater has put out because she has complex storylines, rich characters and believable dialogue. The book was a doozy and really showed some of the psychological trauma you can have from leaving an abusive relationship however Glynis is a feisty character with family around her. I would love to know more about Dracula's first wife and then what happens next for Glynis"}, {"userName": "Lorre", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6349980-lorre", "userReview": "Waw!

However, as I progressed through the books, I became engrossed, and perhaps more important, invested in Glynis and her story.

I was half way through and thinking about when Vlad would become more involved, and then Hello! It was very intense and often brutal to go through those scenes with her having to endure Vlad.
