Even if your death wouldn't accomplish something so long-awaited, glorious, and grand, I'd still relish this moment, killing you.\"I'm sorry, was I supposed to agree with absolutely everything the evil villain said and wait, with baited breath, for her to kill Lucinda Price painfully on my behalf? This review has spoilers, by the way.I have a list of rules for authors. Kind of like a checklist to ensure that their novel is going to be good. This book breaks them all. For posterity I'm going to list exactly which ones and why.1.\tDon\u2019t assume that your audience isn\u2019t as smart as you. Statistically speaking, you\u2019re probably sitting on a fat, old average like the rest of us. Try to flex our grey matter. Please. Lauren Kate thinks we're idiots. She really, really does. The prologue basically immediately informs the reader that Lucinda Price has been reincarnated and that black shadows follow her around ready to engulf her and take her away. The title of the book is Fallen, and at page 51 Daniel's last name is revealed to be Grigori. Anyone with half a brain already knows the gist of this story. That Daniel is a fallen angel and the Lucinda Price is his loved one reincarnated. yet 389 pages later, Lauren Kate pulls this out like it's some kind of massive reveal. No. Fuck no. Having your main character come to a conclusion almost four hundred pages after the reader is just an insult. You never learn more than this by the way. Other than a vague explanation as to the true function of the shadows - that is it. *Kat's attempts to pierce her own eyes a la Jocasta*2.\tDon\u2019t cover up bad writing and plot with a sexy, smoldering character.Chances are they won\u2019t be nearly sexy, or smoldering enough. It is painful to read badly written literature so just get it right the first time, please.The writing in this novel is terrible, by the way. The editing is even worse. Perhaps the copy-editor had a hard time focusing on the text while her brain hemorrhaged as well. The sentences were choppy, they flowed poorly and the word choices were sometimes just plain weird. 5.\tCharacterization is everything.This doesn\u2019t mean that your characters have to be likable at all times \u2013 or likable at all. But they have to be interesting, worth reading and fleshed out. They have to react to situations within their character or in relation to their personal growth and they have to reflect the plot and the changes in your story.Characterization... where do I even start. *sighs* okay. Here we go, but this is going to be painful and filled with profanities.Lucinda Price - If I ever saw this girl in the street, I would probably punch her in the face. I have never read such a useless, pathetic, tragically stupid female protagonist IN MY LIFE. Luce's first encounter with Daniel results in him flipping her off. After that he ignores her, rejects her, accuses her of stalking him, ditches her, suggests that she is annoying, accuses her of being an intruder... the list goes on. GET A HINT, WOMAN! HE DOESN'T LIKE YOU! Only he does, and why they fall in love or want anything to do with each other is probably the only fucking mystery in this whole book. No wait, I scratch that. They DO belong together. They're both prats. I wouldn't wish them on anybody else. She's a useless, stupid idiot and he's a selfish, moronic asshole. It must be true love. Daniel treats Luce like shit. Luce accepts Daniel's treatment of her (the fact that she does this causes ME to agree with Daniel's assessment), internalizes it, agonizes over it and still goes back for more. Again and again. The ONE time. I mean it. ONE FUCKING TIME that Luce sticks up to Daniel and tells him not to treat her like an idiot (the idiot that she is) he kisses her (probably just to shut her up - for which I'm eternally grateful) then she immediately stops requesting that he treat her like an adult and an equal and he goes right back to muttering cryptic things without explaining them because her puny female mind couldn't possibly comprehend them.Oh. And ANOTHER thing! She obsessively stalks him, against all odds seeks him out again and again. Finally, when he DOES tell her the truth, what does she do? She runs away. That's right. Like a big fucking pansy, it turns out that her puny female mind really CAN'T handle information. I feel like muttering that scene out of anchorman where Ron Burgundy says:\"I'm a man who discovered the wheel and built the Eiffel Tower out of metal and brawn. That's what kind of man I am. You're just a woman with a small brain. With a brain a third the size of us. It's science.\"Daniel is crap. Need I say more? Crappity crap crap CRAP! \"Oh dear, I love this girl, but if I kiss her she's going to DIE!\"Well here's a fucking idea, dickhead, DON'T KISS HER! (Or don't kiss her on the lips *winks* at least not the ones on her face! *Chuckles evilly*) when she shows up, as she inevitably will, run away. Go to a club and pick up a chick and take her home for \"coffee\" or to show her your special angel wings. Whatever floats your boat. Don't stick around and interact with her and torture yourself by getting close.Other characters in this book are two-dimensional. If there were such a concept as one-dimensional, I'm sure Kate would have striven to achieve that instead. They are stand in cardboard cut outs and easily forgettable and inconsequential. 6.\tYour story needs to have an actual story.It needs to have conflict, resolution; climax, d\u00e9nouement; beginning and an end. They don\u2019t always need to occur in the standard order, but something needs to happen.Can you read that, Lauren Kate? Something needs to fucking happen! Not just 401 pages of stalking! That's not a fucking story! 7.\tResearch.Know what the hell you\u2019re writing about and put the work and research into your story. Nothing is more annoying then reading a book about an Anglican Preacher in the seventeenth century burning witches, when you know perfectly well how very historically inaccurate that is.This author knows nothing about angels. Or the Bible. Or religion. She shows no concept for the Biblical nature of angels, their real function, how they differ from humans. It's. Just. So. Fail. Kill me now. I felt like putting on my sexy librarian outfit, pulling out my cain (hyuk hyuk) and giving a very interesting instruction about the Bible in both its modern context and the times in which it is historically acknowledged to be written as well as the spiritual nature or angels and demons and heaven. Probably would have been a lot more fun than reading this book because I look very sexy in my outfits and I give great feedback to my students!And finally - the last rule that this story broke:8.\tConsider what message your story is telling.Remember that usually, and historically, stories don\u2019t usually exist just for the hell of it. Stories have messages and meaning. They teach us and give us a perspective on life. Storytelling carries a great responsibility because there are few things more emotive to people than stories.My husband and I have been together for seven years now and I can confidently say I love him. I love him. I think about him. I know him. Most of all, I know WHY I love him and I know WHY he's perfect for me and why nobody else on this planet would ever do.Fallen seems to think it has something to say about Love. Albeit, I wonder if even it knows what its opinion on love is. Maybe that love conquers all? No, not really since in the book it doesn't. Maybe that love is eternal? Well, yeah maybe. An eternal pain-in-the-ass is the theme it really seems to be going for.However, I hate the version of love in this book. It's some mystical, unexplainable tie in this book. Something that just is without any further information provided. I can't help but compare Daniel's alleged \"sacrifice\" in losing Luce over and over again because he keeps selfishly kissing her (when he kisses her she dies apparently) with real love. If he really loved her then he'd leave as soon as he caught a glimpse of her. He'd move across the country. He'd keep running from her until the end of time for her own good. When I compare it to how completely unselfish my husband is with his love, I can never excuse either Daniel or Luce for their actions.The relationship in this book is so unbalanced. There is SO much information that Daniel never gives her because she just needs to trust him and apparently her fragile little female mind won't be able to handle it. Then of course, there is the complete and utter power imbalance in their relationship. This book is almost an argument against feminism. To make the boy love you, you must accept his treatment and patiently wait out his scorn and derision. You're supposed to obsess over the boy of your dreams and imagine who he is in complete contradiction to the person he's shown you to be. Somehow this is supposed to be romantic. This is supposed to be real love. Well, I live real love. I live it every day in its very boring, mundane existence. I live with my soulmate and we go day from day. This book is nothing like love. This book knows obsession, hormones and drama. It knows nothing about love. It is devoid of respect, attention, tenderness and the freely giving love that I know to be real.The back of the book has a teaser for the next book stating:\"Can you bear the... TORMENTThe next book in the Fallen series by Lauren Kate\"The answer is: No. I really, really can't bear it. I'll leave it to people who don't mind having their braincells sucked into a black hole of anti-feminist propaganda.

This book is full of fail, end of story. There is no other way to describe this book, really. That's a lie. There is another way to describe how bad this book is. Take everything that sucked about the Twilight series and multiply that by any number (except zero. Or one. Or any negative number. Aw, crap, you know what I mean). Because really, this book is a bad version of Twilight except with fallen angels instead of vampires. Oh, and, compared to this book, Twilight is a friggin' literary masterpiece. That's how bad this book is. You think Bella is irritating? Meet Luce Price, the most irritating protagonist ever. She's stupid (yet still somehow incredibly smart, according to her grades), a creepy stalker, and has zero sense of self-worth or shame. When Daniel, this story's \"hero\", flips Luce the bird and then proceeds to treat her like garbage--on several occasions--what does Luce do? She instantly becomes obsessed with Daniel and breaks into the school records room to find out more about him. Not once does she think she might be crossing a line by going through someones private records. Obviously, talking to him--like a normal person would--to find out more about him, is out of the question, amirite? Oh, and when a guy treats a girl like garbage that is actually code for TRULUV4EVA. Look, I could go on and on about how idiotic this book is, but I won't since I have better things to do, like, write hate mail to the publisher of this book. Seriously, I'd be hard pressed to find a book that is worse then this flaming pile of garbage, and had I a time machine I'd use it to go back in time in order to stop myself from ever reading this book. To sum up my review: Worst. Book. I've. Ever. Read. EVER. (yes, the second 'ever' was entirely necessary) An incredible waste of time and money, and ink, and trees...I could go on (and on and on...). This book makes babies cry. Edit: As of February 26, 2010 over nine hundred goodreads users think this book is amazing*. Amazing?! Really??? I mean, don't get me wrong, I fully understand really liking a book that has little to no literary value (see my guilty pleasures shelf for proof). But amazing? Come on people! Five stars really should be reserved for the classics--great literary works, or something that really moves you emotionally; makes you think on a deeper level then usual; makes you want to be a better person. It is beyond me that anyone truly loves this book. Seriously. I'm sure a lot of you are wondering why, if I hated this book so much, I read the entire thing. Originally, after only reading the first few chapters of this book I hurled it across the room in a fit of anger (and no, I'm not a rageaholic. This book--the fact that it was published and I was duped into wasting money on it--just enraged me that much). But I had to finish it. I just had to. Because I was dumb enough to believe it got better--but it didn't. It just got worse and worse as the book continued. The absolute worst part is this book is 452 pages long, and the first 400 pages contain no plot whatsoever. Though I already mentioned how much I dislike the protagonist I feel I should add: Luce is an insipid creature (read: TSTL). All she does is think of the most mundane crap--stuff that isn't in the least bit important or interesting--it almost makes you want to take a drill to your own head. At one point she even wonders what size shoe Daniel wears--mind you this is during the same period if time he's sending out strong 'I hate Luce' vibes like nobody's business. And yeah, for a girl who may or may not have accidentally on purpose killed the last boy she liked, it's truly creepy how easily she gets over it and readily moves on to the next victims boys. Is she that messed up and desensitized? Seems to me Luce is a sociopath and should be in prison, not reform school. Speaking of said reform school: It's laughable how the security is practically non-existent. Did the author do any research on reform schools? I mean, come on! These teens--not counting Penn--are at this reform school because they are more then a little dangerous to themselves and/or others. They are there to be reformed, not kindasorta babysat. I really could go on about the massive plot holes contained in this novel--of which there are several--but I won't. I'm just going to say one last thing: I'm shocked that something this bad could be published and then--I kid you not--be optioned for a film. Really Disney? You really want to take this horribly written excuse of a novel and make it into a movie? Are you that hard up for script ideas? Really??? Fine, go ahead. Perpetuate the death of all good literature. Celebrate mediocrity. Rape the young minds of our society. I mean, everyone else is doing it, why not join in. As long as you make a buck who cares, amirite??? --- *Quick review of goodreads rating system: five stars='amazing', four stars='really liked it', three stars='liked it', two stars='it was okay', one star='didn't like it'---UPDATE (06/27/11): Over 300 people like this review.

New girl at school2. Mary Sue3. Girl attracts the hottest guys even though she has no personality or depth or anything remotely interesting about her4.

What is it with YA paranormal romance writers and making their characters complete dimwits with no depth. I'm tired of these dull, boring, weak, characterless girls. It's a damn shame I've had such shitty experiences with YA books in my life. It makes me want to give up on the YA romance genre for good."}, {"userName": "Kiki", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4074594-kiki", "userReview": "Thanks, Satan, but your book recommendation didn't work out that well. Better luck next time, yeah?Along with literally HUNDREDS of other people who read this book, I was completely brainwashed by the stunning cover. I literally walked into WHSmith, looked at it, had a massive aneurysm, and by the time I'd come round the book was inexplicably in my hand and my wallet was thirty dollars lighter.Who knew?Gaiz. I should have known better than to pick up something that P.C. Cast, of all people, \"loved loved loved!\" P.C. Cast would love love love a piece of broken dry wall if it promised her some publicity. I mean, really. Come on. Just take a look at this thing:\"She didn't usually get involved with rocker guys - but then again, none of them had ever pulled the desk next to her even closer, plopped down beside her, and stared at her with eyes quite so green.\"That's, um...yeah. That's pretty bad, guys. I am constantly appalled by the craft of this book. It feels cheeky, in fact, for this book to just sit there on my shelf, playing coy, flicking its hair like it doesn't know shit. I feel like, if it could talk, it would smirk and say, \"Look how many of me there are. There's only one of you.\"Yes, there is indeed only one of me, Fallen, but at least I have my pride. What the cover of this book tries to tell you is that this is a dark, twisty tale of dark, twisty things with dark, twisty characters that'll make you do one because they're so dark and twisty and awesome. But alas, the characters in this book are no more dark and twisty than the flame guy from Howl's Moving Castle. (That was a GREAT movie.) They do nothing but wander around, angst, fuck each other over passive-aggressively, whine, angst some more, fuck each other over some more, whine again, kiss like something from a cheap Harlequin knock-off and then BAM! Get on a private plane and fly straight into the core of the sun. Oh, if only I were so lucky.Seriously, the entire story arc of this novel goes like this:Daniel: I fucking hate Luce!Luce: I fucking love Daniel!Daniel: I fucking hate Luce!Luce: Ermagerd, angels!Daniel: *treats Luce like shit*Luce: Ermagerd, angels! *swoon*Luce and Daniel are an absolute catastrophe, the literary Tunguska event, just some sort of vast explosion of shite that annihilates anything within a thousand-mile radius. Not only are they both fuckwits, but they're worse when they're together: Luce becomes stupider, and Daniel becomes more evil, in that he's not just a rude asshole but he's actually seriously problematic and controlling. I'm not sure whose sphincter this \"fuckboys are hot and power imbalances are sexy\" trope was pulled out of, but it's making me rage. It's like this: Daniel tells Luce who she should and should not talk to, makes disgusting gestures at her, talks to her as if she's a piece of crap, calls her stupid, and let's not forget the crowning glory, which is that fact that he has murdered hundreds and hundreds of incarnations of her in the past.Am I a sap, for buying into this series? Probably. But my copy must have been lacking in dispensed soma gas, because to me Daniel never appears to be in any way SEXY or GORGEOUS or AMAZING or SWEET. He is a piece of shit. He is a poster boy for patriarchal violence. As if we needed any more unintentional metaphors for dating violence in YA.The crux of it is that Daniel is a fucking serial killer. And I for one will not invest myself in a \"hero\" who has systematically murdered every incarnation of his lover since the dawn of time. And that's what this is. Look: when Daniel kisses or has romantic contact with Luce, she explodes into a ball of flame. Every single time, he knows this, and yet he still pursues her. How is this in any way justifiable? You can call it what you want, but this is the truth. He murders Luce. Murders her. He premeditates his interaction with her, then approaches her and makes advances, knowing that it will all end with her death.Why can't people see this? The male lead in this book is a murderer. Why would you want a boyfriend who is happy to murder you? What is that? Why is that okay? Why is that romantic?WHY?It's not like there was even a halfway decent plot to wrap a silver lining around all that rape culture. There was just a huge black hole of nothingness, peppered with vague references to Luce's black hair which everybody seems to be inexplicably obsessed with and some confusing is-she-or-isn't-she flip-flopping with Penn, who's basically there to fill in the dialogue gaps while Luce obsesses over that fuckhead Daniel. Luce spends about 90% of her time fawning over Daniel, 3% angsting about the bland sub-plot of the moving shadows, and 7% expressing this smug disgust of anyone who isn't Daniel. And what in the name of David Bowie's blouse was going on with the setting? For a reform school, there wasn't much reforming going on. It was basically just a boarding school with some easily-outsmarted cameras pretending to be ominous and barred windows which, when the students are allowed to skip class and roam the grounds, prove to be completely pointless. Why bar the windows if you're going to let students just wander right out of the front gate? And that isn't even the half of it. This book is just so intellectually challenged. It's like that annoying little cousin who insists that one plus one equals window, because they think that makes them cute or funny or endearing. Fallen, you are as cute, funny and endearing as a fungal infection. Really, though. There are so many ridiculous things about this book. The last scene? The principal flies Luce off in private plane to...somewhere, to...some end, with...someone. I actually don't understand the principal's involvement at all. Also, the entire school was full of angels just meandering around making cryptic remarks to Luce. No, it's not as if, as angels, they have anything better to do. They just swan about being so funny, so witty, so mysterious, so hot! Guys, no wonder God kicked you out of Heaven. You are absolutely insipid. And why didn't they realize that the evil megalomaniac villain was just casually chilling in the library? Talking to Luce? They appear to know who the villain is once she reveals herself to Luce, so why didn't they just catch her in the parking lot and stab the shit out of her? Daniel even hangs around in the library. He has actual fucking contact with the person whom he knows is out to kill Luce, or something, whatever, this book makes no sense.I feel like this book has some kind of personal vendetta against me. It wants to watch me squirm. It wants to wriggle around in my hands, adjusting its perfect makeup and snorting delicately whenever I roll my eyes at its stupidity, as if I could simply never understand it. This book is a snob. An entitled, cheeky, overhyped snob. If it were a person, I'd slap it upside the head. This book can go eat a peppercorn. This book can go stuff itself.And just to add insult to injury, my copy smells funny. Kind of like Dentastix. That's cool, though, because after flagellating myself with it once, I won't be touching it with a barge pole.

Fallen angels are angels who have broken off from God, as she so eludes in her story. There are no \"good\" fallen angels, only those who follow Satan. And the disturbing behavior of the \"good\" fallen angels fall right in line with those who break away from God. I didn't care for any of them. Daniel is way too inconsistent to make him likable or believable, and the revelation we already know doesn't clear him of any of his actions. If Luce is in danger from shadows, Satan, religious zealots with higher power, a whole lot more than Daniel, he should have been more concerned for her welfare, even if he can only supervise her protection from a distance, instead of basing their entire relationship on sexual tension and confessions of unrequited love.There is no way I will be reading the next book because I suspect that while this book frustrated me (making me not even want to finish it much less the series), the next one will infuriate me. From the clues Kate plants, it is my impression that Cam is supposed to be some version of Lucifer and Luce some version of Eve, which makes Daniel some version of Adam. Not only are her vacant characters unworthy of these Biblical characters, but I'm supposed to believe that Eve has been reincarnating since the dawn of time? That the good and evil of the entire world centers on the twisted, shallow, teenage love affair of fallen angels? Blasphemy. Adam is not a fallen angel, nor would he be so rude and crude. Satan did not love Eve; Satan loves nobody but himself. The fact that he only wants to harm us kind of lies at the basis of Christianity. Resurrection is found in the Bible, not reincarnation, and to make it the reincarnation of mother Eve somehow makes it worse. Adam and Eve are sacred in my book, and to see their story so mutilated like this is nothing more than disrespectful. I cringe to think all that Kate is intending to hide from us in her next book.

I was rather dubious of the whole trend (and still am), but boy, do I love me some Old Testament crazy, so I thought, \"Let's see what they do with this.\" Even with my low expectations, I found this disappointing! We begin with Daniel Grigori (whose last name gives the whole thing away if you know your stuff), a fallen angel cursed to fall in love with the same girl every seventeen years for eternity. The girl in question is Lucinda a.k.a. \"Luce\" Price, who has just entered Sword & Cross, a reform school for troubled teens, after the mysterious death of a classmate that she perhaps caused, but doesn't remember. As soon as she sees Daniel, she's drawn to him, and soon feels increasingly certain they have met before, and she'll do anything to try and discover his secrets.Unfortunately, Luce is a pretty dumb heroine. She spends the entire book mooning over a guy that is mean to her every chance he gets and then mopes around feeling sorry for herself. That's kind of it. At one point she talks about how she knows Latin and French and had a 4.0 GPA at a top prep school, etc. but she sure doesn't read that way! She's not a strong character--she's not feisty, she's not witty, and, worst of all, she's passive. She doesn't do anything so much as things happen to her. Daniel and Luce fall for each other time after time, but the author doesn't try very hard to make either Luce or Daniel interesting. Did the author think it wasn't necessary to show why they would fall in love with each other? Both were no more than cardboard cutouts. I don't think they even had a real conversation at all before they decided they were each others' ~true love~. I don't care if they've technically known each other for centuries, make them interesting in this incarnation!I actually agreed with one of the \"villains\" when she said, \"In this lifetime you're nothing more than you appear to be: a stupid, selfish, ignorant, spoiled little girl who thinks the world lives or dies on whether she gets to go out with some good-looking boy at school...I'd still relish this moment...killing you.\" I don't think that's supposed to happen.Some other things:*The climactic battle--which had no real build-up--takes place off-screen! *The \"villain\" wasn't threatening and came off more as a simpering monologuer rather than clever or creepy. And he wore gold eye shadow.*People did not smile in pictures in 1854, among other things!*How are some fallen angels on the \"good side\" and others aren't? Fallen angels already chose Satan over God, no?There are just so many interesting things an author could do with this subject, but it's so flat. There's just not enough of the mythology here to make it worth my while.Oh, but I do like the cover. And I'll still recommend this to girls who liked Twilight...because it still manages to be better than Twilight."}, {"userName": "Elle", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4090840-elle", "userReview": "[fallen angel (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Cait \u2022 A Page with a View", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47412532-cait-a-page-with-a-view", "userReview": "This was actually one of the better YA paranormal romances I've read, but I guess I'm not really into this genre at this point. Yes, it has the typical plot of super intense star-crossed lovers, a love triangle, damned immortals, and it follows the normal outline (the MC arrives at a new school, is instantly attracted to some brooding dangerous guy, and he's rude as he tries to keep her away to protect her). BUT the writing is coherent and there's an added twist of the girl being reincarnated every 70 years or so to fall in love with that same guy over and over. ^^ This is not a spoiler because the author made it super clear in the intro. But then she still had a big reveal towards the end... so maybe don't expect anything too complex or surprising. So I mostly appreciated that there wasn't a ton of girl hate or abusive behavior from the guy. That might be a sad thing to give an extra star for, but I guess we're at that point. And I really did like the awesome creepy graveyard outside of the school! That was a neat setting. But the MC was super pathetic and this whole story is mostly her obsessively stalking the guy even after he's been nothing but abrasive and tried to get rid of her. She's kind of delusional and the baseless intense attraction felt more like her being a helpless magnet than \"love.\" Plus, she just ignored reality and waited for the guy to turn into who she expected him to be and to eventually clue her in when he deemed her able to comprehend the situation. So both of them got a bit annoying. BUT the guy & the story didn't irritate me as much as other similar books about fallen angels (looking at you Hush, Hush). And there was definitely some quality entertainment. Like his eyes are purple, his skin is gold, and his angel wings are iridescent rainbowy colors... are you picturing this?So yeah... sometimes iffy stories are just fun if the writing isn't too bad and there's nothing terribly enraging about the plot. I was entertained enough to stick with this to the end! Definitely think I would have liked it more when I was younger."}, {"userName": "Carolyn  Storer", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2449271-carolyn-storer", "userReview": "4.5 StarsI was really excited about reading Fallen, the cover is absolutely gorgeous and I just had to have it! Luckily I received an ARC, thanks to Random House Children's Books. This is another book that has had a lot of hype recently and, as with Hush Hush, it had a lot to live up to. I have read negative as well as positive reviews, so I went in with a completely open mind, and I wasn't disappointed. The story starts out a little slow at the beginning and not a lot really happens in the way of action until half way through the book. The days Luce spends at Sword and Cross reform school, where she has been sent after an incident with a fire, which killed her ex-boyfriend, does become a little repetitive and drawn out and all I really wanted was the story to get going. But I think the author was trying to set the scene, give us some really well developed characters and lots of suspense before revealing all. In retrospect, I liked this approach as sometimes a story can move along quickly but then have no depth at all. There are many characters in Fallen, all of which I think are really well rounded. Even those that are not the main focus still have their own story and you feel they are all central to Luce's life. Although none of the characters are particularly 'dangerous', there is a darkness about Daniel and Cam that is subtle but definitely there. As each character grows and a little more is revealed about them, you realise that there is more to each of them which is not necessarily what you first thought. Nice twists and turns kept my interest and I was very intrigued as to how this book would pan out. The atmosphere is dark and edgy too and each detail of Luce's surroundings is described well and at times I really felt as though I was there.Luce herself is a nice character. She is interesting and I think she will develop into quite an intriguing female protagonist. Sometimes she is quite witty and feisty, but at other times she can be a little slow on the uptake. But overall, I'm looking forward to seeing how she develops and deals with the revelations which occur at the end of Fallen.Cam and Daniel, who are the two main love interests for Luce, are both delicious. They are very different from each other and at first I wasn't quite sure who was the good guy and who was the bad guy. As I got to know Daniel, I began to like him more and more and could completely understand why Luce is so captivated, and almost hypnotised, by him. He is gorgeous, and a very sexy fallen angel, *move over Patch!* Verdict:The story does take time to get going and is definitely a slow burner, but I think it is well worth the wait, so be patient. The ending is exciting, albeit a bit rushed; maybe a few pages from the beginning would have been better used at the end. I was left with a few questions, but that's okay, as I know there's another book coming, and I can't wait! Fallen is a brilliant read and has set the scene for what I hope will be a very exciting series."}, {"userName": "P ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25327841-p", "userReview": "\u201cWhat if the person you were meant to be with could never be yours?\u201d\nFirstly, I really loved the movie even though everybody says it's bad or a copycat of Twilight. Yes, I must admit Fallen and Twilight have many similar things. Daniel and Edward. Luce and Bella. The insta-love that ignites so fast. But nowadays, some books are written from that same plot, however, the narration and the writers' strategy are the most important to make their books different despite of the plot. \n\u201cThe only way to survive eternity is to be able to appreciate each moment.\u201d \nFallen starts with a girl named Luce. She's sent to the school that everyone here ends up with their crime. She makes friends, though some of them hates her, Luce manages to pull off the attention of these two boys, Daniel and Cam. Cam is hot, he's the dark side of her love interest while Daniel is someone Luce can't even have because he tries to push her away all the time with no reasons. Yet Luce doesn't give up, she stalks him, digs up his past, and is angry when she thinks that Denial belongs to another girl. That's insane ! I mean I liked the story, of course, but some of her behaviors were creepy as hell, and I couldn't believe that she was the center of this book where every man seemingly revolves around her.I didn't like the overly descriptive way of writing style. I sometimes like it when it gives me some feelings to appreciate the scenes or characters instead of being bored, but in this book, I got nothing from that narration, NOTHING, as if the author wanted to prolong the story and she failed to answer all the questions she dumped between the chapters. Alas, they're not answered and left me curious for book two after finishing this.\n\u201cThe tender pressure of his lips soothed her, like a warm drink in the dead of the winter, when every part of her felt so cold.\u201d \nWhat made me like this book was the dynamic of the story, which is abundant and gripped me from the first page. That being said, Deniel is such a jerk when he first meets Luce, he even flips her off and I thought, \"How does this happen ? OMG ! he's a jackass\" Then the story continues to the part where Luce finds a truth about her past life and she makes a stupid choice eventually, I hated her so much then. But I couldn't stop reading, I was incredibly addicted to this book. Although I might give up if I read other books and this kind of predicament happens. Anyway, Fallen has something that kept me plowing through it without stopping and looking back to what I've done or how I can finish this book without a break. Admittedly I enjoyed Fallen more than I thought. Maybe it's the fact that I saw the movie before the book, so it helped and guided me a lot about where I should expect or get the most out of it. Naturally, the pace is undeniably sluggish that you can skip the first half of the book and you'll surely understand the rest of it.\n\u201cYou're still here,\" he whispered.\"They couldn't drag me away.\u201d \nAnd I ship Cam so hard.

She goes to the reform school and meets let\u2019s just say a bunch of weird people who have each been here for a long time for who knows what and decides to make them her friends. I know I would have either ran away from that school or never interacted with anyone because someone might just be a murderer. But that\u2019s not the case in this book. Luce sees Daniel on her first day itself and feels like she knows him and for some reason gets it in her head that she wants to find out everything about this guy because she likes him even though he\u2019s cold and seems like he doesn\u2019t want anything to do with her. The romance part of this book really threw me off because neither of the characters do anything or exhibit any characters for the other person to like and are practically strangers but still end up falling in love. Which is very absurd considering the fact that nobody falls in love with a random guy because they seem familiar, but in this case I guess she feels her love for him in the past. And there is also the part where he\u2019s rude to her or brushes her off for no reason but come to her rescue all the time, I mean just tell her who you are in the beginning and get it over with or go away and don\u2019t look back.This would be a whole lot more meaningful if we were told how they fell in love in the first place, and I hope that at least the first time they fell in love it was more believable. Throughout this book there was not a single thing mentioned about either of them or their personality that made them intriguing or desirable in the slightest. We all love some sass or humor or loyalty or a badass streak that makes us fall in love with characters but all those things were given to the supporting characters and not the protagonists themselves which is kind of disappointing.Luce is not a great protagonist. It\u2019s not that she\u2019s a bad person or anything, but she\u2019s very innocent, trusting, and naive at some points it gets a little irritating. I mean at one point she gets in a car a guy in the reform school sent to pick her up and take her somewhere, SOMEWHERE. You know that\u2019s how murders and horror movies start right?! Why would anyone with any ounce of common sense get in a car a guy in a REFORM school unless they have a death wish or zero self preservation skills. But I am going to give the characters a chance I don\u2019t dislike any of them and given time maybe they\u2019ll reveal more of their personalities and will prove to be great people.That was a lot of negative about the characters but I did enjoy the premise of the plot. I am Interested in seeing where the whole fallen angel thing and the war that\u2019s been going on for centuries is headed. I do want to see where the characters are taken considering it\u2019s a 5 book seriesThe greatest part is in all of this I think is that the other people she meets like Arienne are more interesting than Daniel or Luce. I\u2019m not saying I hate them I\u2019m just saying I need more reason to like them. I will be continuing this series because I want to see where the plot goes and I want to see if there\u2019s like a final war or something, because who doesn\u2019t like a good war."}, {"userName": "Kelly (and the Book Boar)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11183856-kelly-and-the-book-boar", "userReview": "Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/Hmmmm, I wonder what my friends thought of this one????\n^^^^^\u201cThis should end well,\u201d said no Mitchell ever.Let me begin by swearing to all of you that I\u2019m not becoming one of those \u201crage reviewers.\u201d You know who I\u2019m talking about.

Bella and Edward errrr Luce and Daniel also attended a reform school rather than regular high school (but no details were ever really provided explaining why \u2013 that\u2019s how they get suckers to buy all the other books in the series) which eliminated the need for meddling parental units from the story . . . \nThere also wasn\u2019t a wicked hot werewolf love triangle thrown in which really sucked for me (#teamjacob4eva) . . . . \nAnd although the love could be described as \u201cinsta\u201d it made a bit more sense since the two had loved and lost each other for centuries so the combo of deja vous and horny teen made it a bit less pukey.

Oh wait, silly me, yes there is! I can't stand this new trend of shoving shallow storylines into needless series and trying to hook the reader with an annoying cliffhanger. Not right IMHO. This book came across as an incomplete story, where there were many questions left unanswered, and done so in such a sloppy manner that they came across as plot holes. For me, this book was a mental equivalent of a migraine, sound familiar? Sorry, but that's how I felt. The mysterious, supposedly good looking Daniel wasn't squee-worthy or engaging enough to hook me for another few books. Can't quite pinpoint it, maybe it was his hostile behavior for more than half the book that I just couldn't get over. He flipped off Luce when he first saw her? Did I read that right? Why? So contrived. He ran brrrrrr.... too cold for my taste. I think the main issue I had with this book were the outstanding questions I have. For example, can someone please tell me what the heck these shadows, errrr wait, announcers, whatevs... What are those? What purpose do they serve? Were they there to protect or harm Luce? What's the difference between the dark and silver/grey shadows? What is up with Roland? The fires?? What caused them? How come no one cared that Todd died in the fire? What really went down the night Trevor died? What was the purpose of introducing over a dozen characters in the first three chapters when a majority didn't even play a part in the rest of the story? What are the angels/demons fighting for and why do they fight when they know neither side will ever be victorious, according to Daniel? How could finding out the truth physically kill Luce? WT?? My list can go on.This is the second book I've read on fallen angels and maybe it's just not my cup of tea, but I didn't find the concept engaging enough to carry me through for another couple of books. But most importantly, I think regardless of this book being set up as a series, it should still be able to stand on its own and provide the reader a conclusive ending, with just enough intrigue to whet your appetite for more, not have you looking in the back cover for missing pages.

Despite the alluring, ambiguous plot promised by the book jacket, this book fell flat in way too many areas.The story is about Lucinda Price, who is sent to Sword and Cross boarding school after being suspected of arson. She also claims to have seen shadows stalking her, which only adds to the paranoia people presume of her. There, she meets some nice friends - but no one compares to the attractive and mysterious Daniel Grigori. He keeps sending her mixed messages: sometimes he tries to keep Luce around, and other times he flicks her off. Despite his roller coaster attitude, Luce finds herself being pulled toward him like a moth drawn to a flame, and will sacrifice anything to get closer to him.The beginning of Fallen was not that bad. It seemed like a typical exposition in an urban fantasy - character goes to so and so place, meets so and so people, finds him/herself attracted to so and so, etc. However, this book continued to crawl at a snail's pace the entire story. Nothing in the first 400 pages seemed relevant or necessary to the plot as a whole.The characters were irritating for the most part. I did not connect to Luce or Daniel. So when the two characters I did not connect with connected with each other, their relationship seemed forced and awkward. There was no explanation of why or how they fell in love, and the author did not craft the chemistry well.Fallen will appeal to many readers because of its lustrous cover, but ultimately contains average writing and does not satisfy.Want to read more of my reviews?

Some authors started without a prologue, do you remember? Used to be quite a la mode. Anyhow, this one introduces us to our doomed lovers; given what I already know, I\u2019m betting this is Daniel and Luce. (Say, why do these reincarnated people never switch genders between lives?) There is tension, and apparently it\u2019s not safe for her to know about their love. He remembers, of course.There was a moment where he says that \u2018there are things more important than love\u2019 and I almost liked him then, but then the Fateful Kissing began and I was disgusted again.This will be an extra-long torture.Oh, and that title. \u2018In The Beginning\u2019? Really? Because if she\u2019s been reincarnated even once before, NEWS FLASH, it\u2019s not the beginning. The beginning would be the first first first time. Not the umpteenth.1.\tPerfect StrangersAnd here we meet Luce, Cam, and Daniel. As I understand it, these are the three points of our love triangle. We are also introduced to the Sword and Cross boarding school, which is preposterously dingy and unpleasant. (Why, exactly, would a court mandate minors be sent to a place that sounds as if it can\u2019t pass any health inspection, EVER? Oh right, plot convenience. Durr.) Luce has some angst in her past, joy oh joy, but I\u2019m willing to bet that she\u2019s innocent of the crime that got her sent here. Because a criminal heroine would be boring. Nothing interesting about murderers and arsonists at all.Oh yes, and the infamous flipping-off scene has occurred. Daniel looks appropriately angelic, but doesn\u2019t act it. This must be him trying to keep Luce away. Won\u2019t work, idiot. You just made yourself more interesting. It\u2019s not \u2018oh, hostile dude, will stay away now\u2019; it\u2019s \u2018why the fuck is he flipping me the bird? I need to learn more about this\u2019. You would think if the guy was eleventy billion years old he\u2019d know that about human nature.Also, we now know that the much-vaunted cover is in accurate, at least if it\u2019s supposed to show Luce as she is now. Her hair is actually short- cue difficulty in picturing character. Eh. I never liked that cover anyhow.2.\tFit To Be TiedReally, what\u2019s with this title? It has nothing to do with the chapter. No one gets tied. It\u2019s just pages of mindless exposition, establishing Cam as a bit of a flirt and Luce as that stereotypical bullied heroine. Are we supposed to be seeing how bad the students at Sword and Cross are? Because someone mashes food into the quote-unquote heroine\u2019s hair? There\u2019s the longing for Daniel, too. Oh that bugs me. She. Just. Met. Him. Why the hell is he taking over her brain? Riiight, because he\u2019s Mr. Alpha Male of Instant Pheromones and she\u2019ll never be able to resist him. And the shock collar. Change of subject, but let me digress this way for a moment. How did they ever managed to design a shock collar that responded to Arriane\u2019s motion? That\u2019s kind of impressive\u2026 or no, wait, kind of stupid. Sciencefail.3.\tDrawing DarkCreepy shadows, librarian, an attempt to establish Luce as the bookish sort- let\u2019s see how that goes- and the first \u2018spark\u2019 between her and Daniel. Daniel who is still being an asshole to chase her off. It\u2019s still not working.Here is something I\u2019m thinking about: why are the reincarnated lovers always teenagers these days? Isn\u2019t there a great story to be told about two people who\u2019ve reached middle age, maybe even married and settled down, realizing that they were destined to be together and drawn apart by something as simple as chance? Yes, these books are targeted at teens. But this has been done and done and done again for teens. Where are the novels that handle this in a logical, adult manner and refuse to get side-tracked by hormones? I guess that\u2019s a large part of what bugs me about YA PNR: the plot gets hijacked by chemical imbalances in the heroine\u2019s brain, essentially, and veers off into Angstyhornyland and never comes back.4.\tGraveyard ShiftOh goodness, did she really use the word \u2018spherical\u2019 to describe a teacher? She did, she totally did. And then there\u2019s some repetitive sentences that I was re-writing in my head. Writingfail and Editorfail....and that's as far as I got.

So, I'm torn. On the one hand, I want others to have the same experience, which would mean I would have to keep mum about the plot etc. On the other hand, I really really want to talk about what actually happens. See? Torn.I admit, unashamedly, that I bought this book for its cover (please, click on the image to get a better view, it's worth it). 2009 has been a very, very good year for YA covers, and this is easily in the top 5 (don't ask me what other books are in the top 5, because it's like the Tardis: bigger on the inside). It's gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous. Composition, typeface, colour, atmosphere - it has it all.Since I got it for the cover, and on the vague assumption that it would be some kind of paranormal romance book (they usually are, with covers like this), I came to it with virtually no expectations. This turned out to be a great advantage for the novel, because the prose isn't its strong suit. \"But what is it actually about?\" I hear you asking. Let's not rush into these things. I'm still gawking at the cover ...Lucinda Price hasn't had the easiest of childhoods. Since she began seeing shadows at a young age, her worried parents have dragged her around to psychiatrist after psychologist, hoping for answers. Only by lying has Luce managed to get off the hated medication and have a semblance of a normal life - until, one night at a beach party, the boy Luce was with dies and everyone, including Luce herself, wonders what she had to do with it.She is packed off to a reform school called Sword & Cross in Georgia by a judge and her parents, a place dating back to the Civil War, complete with its own cemetery and church-turned-gym. The students are strange or crazy, many with tracking bracelets on their wrists; there are security cameras everywhere and a fence to keep them in. Within her first hour there, she is befriended by Arriane, and her eye is drawn to a gorgeous boy called Daniel. She feels like she knows him somehow, but after a friendly grin he gives her the finger. It's just the start of an immediate animosity on Daniel's part that Luce can't understand, or reciprocate. She also befriends Penn, a ward of the school since her father, the groundskeeper, left her an orphan; and Cam, a green-eyed, handsome boy, makes it clear he's interested. But Luce can only think of Daniel, who wants nothing to do with her. As the appearance of the shadows increases, and her strange dreams of being held in Daniel's arms high in the sky persist, Luce is drawn deeper into a world of timeless love and a timeless battle between good and evil.So that's my spoiler-free review - except that I've left a few hints you can choose to ignore or dissect, as you please. If you're really wondering what kind of paranormal this is, [spoiler!:] the title gives it away [/spoiler:]. If you're like me, you won't even notice. It meant nothing to me until I started putting the clues together - and it was fun doing it that way, figuring it out as I went. You WILL figure it out a LONG time before Luce does. Considering that hers is the only perspective we get (and the only reason we don't get her first-person narration is so that Kate can include a prologue and epilogue from Daniel's perspective) and that we start out with the same clues she does, this is somewhat surprising. She is a bit slow on the uptake. Now, since I can't talk about the heavy symbolism or [blank:] undertones, or any of the fun stuff, because just not enough people have read it yet, let's talk about something else that's become indicative in YA fiction over the last few years. How many YA books have you read that are about a girl, often a lonely or isolated or virtually friendless girl, starting a new school year (either at their regular school or a new one), and encountering a hot new guy who for some reason or other pretends to hate her?I can tell you how many I've read - in fact, I'll list them for you:TwilightJessica's Guide to Dating on the Dark SideDeadly Little SecretsEvermoreEvernightPerfect ChemistryThe Vampire Diaries (kind of)I bet you can think of lots more, and this list would be longer but I'm trying to limit how many of \"these\" I read. Possibly Marked should be on the list too, but I just can't remember. I've been told by trustworthy friends that Hush Hush is the worst culprit of all. And now we have Fallen.To be fair, Daniel has a pretty good excuse, but when Luce flares up at his patronising \"you don't understand\" attitude and lets him have it, I had to say \"Good on you Luce!\" For much of the book, it's a puzzle-piecing read (and again, I really wish I could discuss the whole premise, but I made the decision not to give any spoilers and I'll stand by that), which makes it fun, but it's also hugely uneventful. That you only notice it in a vague sort of way is a good thing, but the prose still isn't strong enough to make this a really great book. It relies heavily on the formula mentioned above, plus symbolism and mythology, without questioning anything or being at all original. One of things I really liked about Twilight (that others hated), was the original, or different, take on vampires. I'm not impressed by authors who utilise what's already out there - it's no challenge, and means they haven't really thought about it and lack imagination. Its a harsh criticism I know, but I've been reading adult Fantasy for years and years and originality is the big Sticking Point between good and bad Fantasy. I haven't put this book down as Fantasy, but the criticism still applies. Another criticism I have brings us back to the prose: the descriptions were poorly drawn and sometimes conflicting. I had a hard time picturing the place - maybe because I've never been to that part of the world, but mostly because the descriptions were rather weak. I was also confused by the explanation of Sword & Cross, that it used to be a military outpost during the Civil War - and yet the only descriptions we get are of cinder-block dorms and a church that was built much later than the war. At one point she mentions had decrepit the place is, how it looks like it's decomposing, but mostly I couldn't visualise it at all. Even the church, with its vine-covered exterior, was a confusing site for me - especially considering it houses a large pool and other rooms. There just wasn't enough detail. Kate had the perfect opportunity for some beautiful atmosphere-building to match the lovely cover, but ultimately failed to deliver. I sometimes feel that YA authors are getting lazy. It's not enough to have all the elements there, to follow the formula. This book stands at 452 pages not because there are lots of words, but because the font is so damn big.I will be reading the next book, Torment, though. The ending was just enticing enough, and Daniel said some lovely things that I've read before, and there's still plenty of things to be revealed that they're all being very secretive about. But I'll be hoping for more magic (of the reading variety), more passion, more originality."}, {"userName": "xrysa", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9016476-xrysa", "userReview": "[Are Daniel and Cam going to become allies?Why?

FUCK that. A disgusting, awful, jackass-glorifying book like this deserves to be cussed out, especially after I sat through most of it. And I'm going to cuss this book out, in the style of the 'Fuck you' speech from 25th hour. And I don't care how stupid my review is going to look. FUCK THIS MOTHERFUCKING BOOK. Fuck this book, with writing and plot that is so dry that you literally feel dehydrated reading it. And what was the plot? NOTHING was the plot. Nothing happened. Nothing fucking happened. It was just Luce being a masochist and enjoying being treated like crap by Daniel, while she complained that another guy she was fooling around with wasn't good enough for her because he wasn't a jackass like Daniel. Fuck Luce, that cheap copy of Nora from Hush, hush and Bella Swan. No personality, no interests outside assholes, plus she seems to be completely okay with men who treat her like shit. Because nice guys just don't cut it: they have to flip her off for her to gain interest. They have to try to control her life when they barely know her, they have to stalk her, be an asshole to her, and make-out with her in the aftermath of telling her to shut up. Nope, the angry assholes are the sexiest apparently. She goes through most of the book complaining about how much she loves Daniel when all he does is treat her like shit. But when she starts to actually think about that fact all Daniel has to do is 'kiss her roughly' and all is forgotten. Fuck Daniel. Daniel was nothing more than a goddamn asshole. That guy is NOT romantic. That guy is a manipulative, stuck-up, selfish, ungrateful asshole who deserves to be fucking castrated. And fuck anyone who thinks he is romantic and that his actions and behaviour are all justifiable. You also deserve to be fucking castrated. Do you honestly think it's romantic for a guy to flip you off? Do you think it's romantic for a guy to decide who you should date, who you should hang out with, what school you should go to, and where you go in general? Do you think it's romantic for a guy to tell you to shut up after you try to prove him wrong for thinking you are stupid? And do you think it's okay for him to just be able to kiss you to make you forget? If you answered yes to any of the above questions, you need to see a psychiatrist. No joke, go and get a psychiatrist. Because men like that are not romantic. What's wrong with a normal guy who treats you like an equal, with nothing but respect and kindness? Oh that's right, he's not a douche bag who wants to control your life. I'm sorry, how dare I forget? Also, WHY SHOULD I CARE ABOUT HOW AWESOME HE IS AT FUCKING JUMP ROPING??? Fuck this book, which has more similarities to Hush, hush than it does Twilight, by the way. Here we have competition between Daniel and Patch for who gets to be the bigger asshole, the stupid girl who enjoys men who treat her like shit and does GOOGLE SEARCHES on them. And random shit happening until the end where random drama and fallen angel shit is thrown in that no one will care for anymore at that point. I couldn't finish this because the slow pace, the dryness and the stupidity in this book drove me insane. When I closed this book I literally shouted 'FUCK YOU' at it. And fuck the person who made the cover, not even bothering to give credit to the original model, who had to find out her face was being used when she saw the book in the bookstore. Who knows how to use stock properly? -raises hand- When you use stock you HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO THE ORIGINAL ARTIST AND/OR MODEL OF THAT STOCK. IF YOU DON'T AND DO NOT ASK THE MODEL FOR CONSENT, YOU ARE STEALING. Original pic: http://cait-shoxxi-stock.deviantart.c...Fuck this fucking piece of disgusting literature. I'm sick of seeing abusive romance being glorified as the one true romance. And I'm sick of seeing women in real life using these books as inspiration. ASSHOLES ARE NOT ROMANTIC.

(the others too, actually, but let's stick with the main character to get to the point) every few pages lucinda had to tell us how strong and mighty daniel was, how fascinating his hair was and how hurt and excited she felt, if daniel didn't even deign to look at her. let me quote from the book's \nonly\n (sometimes) likeable character, penn (- yes, it was that bad):\u201cmy point is,\u201d luce said finally, \u201ci\u2019m not so superficial that all i\u2019m looking for is a guy who buys me things.\u201d\u201cnot so superficial, eh?\u201d penn asked. \u201cthen i dare you to make a non-superficial list of why you\u2019re so into daniel. which means no he\u2019s got the loveliest little gray eyes or ooh, the way his muscles ripple in the sunlight.\u201d [...]\u201che just gets me,\u201d she said, avoiding Penn\u2019s eyes. \u201ci can\u2019t explain it.\u201d\u201che gets that you deserve to be ignored?\u201d penn shook her head. i had to force myself to finish this book. luce was really obsessed with daniel and while obsessing (aka stalking) him, she amused/distracted herseld with cam. it was painful to read, i'm telling you. as a reader you constantly think: \"ugh. get a grip on yourself! where's your dignity?\". don't get me wrong, i love books with angels, but only if done well. unfortunately, this was not it. this book could've been good, only it isn't. maybe a few books later, lauren kate's got the knack? there are in fact many, many scenes in the book, which were not well thought out. i guess i'm in the minority here. oh, well."}, {"userName": "SKB", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36307-skb", "userReview": "Oh my holy crap, this book was a piece of work. And by \"work,\" I mean \"steaming turd.\" I would have given this book one star, but I added another one because it was so shittastic that it was fucking hilarious.Several things. One, OHAI reworked Twilight fanfic, or sad homage, or search/replace copy. Second: I can't believe it was possible to find a stupider protagonist than Nora in Hush, Hush. Well, congratulations, Lauren Kate, you have made the most unlikable, brain-dead protagonist I have ever encountered. And to reiterate my review for Hush, Hush, I've read Heart of Darkness. Third: yeah, stretching out a completely predictable plot to over 400 pages and having \"revelations\" in the last chapter or two but answering no questions just so you can make your lame book into a trilogy is a pretty weak move. How does this kind of tripe get published? I guess I took the book out of the library, but hey, I did not pay one cent for it. And I wouldn't. And you shouldn't either.Okay, let's map out all the plot points that are straight from Twilight (a book, which, while cracktacular when I read it, does not hold up to rereadings, and I certainly have many issues with both SMeyer's writing and her portrayal of relationships, her ideas of the roles of men and women in society, and basically don't get me started on this topic).* protagonist is new girl at school. Sure, this one is in Georgia, not Washington state. And it's a reform school, so, it's, like, TOTALLY different from Twilight.* protagonist is supposedly smart, but we know this only because the author tells us she is. And for a rant toward the end of the book: \"You think you're so smart? I spent three years on a full academic scholarship at the best college-prep school in the country. And when they kicked me out, I had to petition--petition!--to keep them from wiping out my four-point-oh transcript.\" Convincing, no?No.But going on:* new girl (Luce/Lucinda) IMMEDIATELY feels a STRONG PULL to the mysterious brooding guy, Daniel. (SPOILER ALERT: HE'S THE EDWARD. He may be blond, but he's the Edward.)* Luce also is sort of attracted to this OTHER sort of mysterious guy, who is dark-haired, but open, charming, and sunny. (SPOILER ALERT: HE'S THE JACOB, EXCEPT EVIL. Okay, so he's sort of Jacob plus James, and his name is CAM, and Cam Gigandet plays James in the movies, SEE?)* Daniel seems to HATE LUCE for NO REASON AT ALL. She is crushed, because she just feels this ... connection with him. OMG WHY DOES HE HATE HER?* Luce gets detention along with a bunch of other kids, gets paired up with Danieledward, and they have to clean gravestones in the convenient graveyard on the reform school property. No sooner do they start interacting when A GIANT ANGEL STATUE ON A GRAVE comes toppling down, nearly crushing Luce, except Edwariel GETS HER OUT OF THE WAY. And then he doesn't look at her or talk to her when everyone else is crowded around her making sure she's okay. Remind you of anything? Van crushing Bella, Edward stopping the van with his hand? And then denying any of it happened? Right.* When Edriel and Belluce touch, they feel this ENERGY, this SPARK. uh huh. Seen that before.* Whenever Luce is in trouble, Daniel magically appears, just knowing, and saving her ass. She wonders why he's there when OMG HE HATES HER WHY, and then she has fleeting hopes he might ZOMG KISS HER, and then he blows her off, leaving her like OMG HE HATES ME WHY.* There is a specific incident where she gets lured off campus (more on this later) by a car service, and there's a bar brawl, and she's worried for her safety, and Daniel is there! With a Silver Volvo white Ford Taurus station wagon.* Daniel continuously says he's no good for her, that they should not be together, but he cannot stay away.* Their \"special place\" on school grounds is this hidden \"clearing,\" which P.S. IS A SYNONYM FOR \"MEADOW.\" * After Daniel finally kisses her, Cam won't let her go until she lets him kiss her too, just so the playing field is even. Eclipse, anyone?* I believe there is even a line where Luce says, \"And that's the first time I dreamed of Daniel Grigori.\" OH COME ON.Second point: Luce is the stupidest protagonist I have ever encountered.* She goes from being \"yeah I'm smart!\" to just being an idiotic boy-crazy stereotype. OMG do I like Cam? He's cute! Oh but Daniel is so mysterious. But Cam is nice to me! He's like the sun! But then again, Daniel is my velvety night!* Cam and Daniel get in a fight in the library over her. Like, a punch out fight. Luce's reaction? \"ZOMG THE CUTE BOYZ ARE FIGHTING OVER MEEEE!\"* Cam continually comes on too strong. She gets a note to meet him at the gates. She meets him there supposedly just to tell him that she's not interested (mind, this is after he and Daniel get into that huge brawl over her and both get suspended). At the gates is another note, telling her a car service will be by to take her to meet him somewhere off campus. The car rolls up. SHE GETS INTO THE CAR. HOW FUCKING STUPID IS SHE? This is like watching the opening to L&O: SVU or Criminal Minds.* It's rather obvious from early on that DANIEL IS AN ANGEL. And yet ... she doesn't realize it, even though she's been dreaming about him and his wings and some other shit, until somewhere around p. 400.* Much as in Hush, Hush, there's a faculty member who seems to know too much about her. Does she question this? I knew from the first or second encounter with the librarian that she was bad news. And yet she does not realize this until the librarian kills her friend and ties Luce to an altar to offer her up as blood sacrifice. Riiiiiiight.Third: the plot, stretched ever so thin until the last 30 pages or so, bringing up a million new questions so we'll read the next book.Seriously, most of the book is spent on Luce's hemming and hawing over which boy is cutest. Then once she gets obsessive about Daniel, she and her friend Pen (the one whose throat is slit by the evil librarian) look at his student file, look for a book supposedly about his ancestors. I'd almost be okay with the obsessive behavior if she stuck to Daniel, but then Cam shows up and takes her on a picnic, and she's like, \"Oh maybe I should like Cam! Oh, I DO like Cam! He's gorgeous! But gorgeous in a different way than Daniel! Cam gave me a necklace! He must like me! Daniel is so broody! I wish he'd kiss me! I think I see wings on him! But wait, why is he so MYSTERIOUS with no FAMILY or PAST? I must be imagining wings.\" Never mind that she was in the library, and there was a FIREBALL, and then this other kid Todd dies in the fire. That occupies her mind for about two seconds. Actually, no one in the book seems to give a shit about poor Todd. Then, back to \"OMG DID DANIEL SAVE ME MAYBE? I FEEL LIKE I WAS FLOATING LIKE FLYING OR SOMETHING BUT IN DANIEL'S ARMS AND THERE WERE WINGS BUT I AM NOT GOING TO PUT THE CLUES TOGETHER AT ALL EVEN THOUGH MOST OF THE TIME WHEN YOU THINK OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE WINGS, YOU THINK ANGELS. LET ME GET BACK TO TELLING YOU ABOUT MY FOUR-POINT-OH AVERAGE.\"There's also the matter of the writing, which is WRETCHED. Firstly, to borrow a phrase from my friend, I Am Jack's Tedious Literary Device. Lauren Kate has an annoying habit of saying, \"It was like [adjective], but [antonym of previous adjective] at the same time.\" Are you familiar with the film Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure? Do you remember the football jock's history presentation toward the end? \"Everything's different, yet the same. Things are more moderner than before, bigger, and yet smaller. It's computers. San Dimas High School Football Rules!\" It's pretty much that, but it's supposed to be good. Don't believe me? Some examples:* \"It was hot and cold at the same time. It was smooth and rough.\"* \"Her face looked old and young at the same time.\"* \u200e\"... the kind of trail Daniel left in his wake was somehow bigger, clearer, and at the same time, even more elusive.\" Other examples of really shitty writing:* \"Luce sighed an audibly homesick, lonely sigh, which made her even more homesick and lonely.\"* \"It was dismally square, dismally fortresslike, fortified by the same barbed wire and barred windows.\"* \"Every time she saw their tongue rings flashing, Luce felt a lonely pinch inside her chest.\"* \"She didn't usually get involved with rocker guys--but then again, none of them had ever pulled the desk next to her even closer, plopped down beside her, and stared at her with eyes quite so green.\"* \"She realized they were still locking eyes when Daniel flashed her a smile. A jet of warmth shot through her and she had to grip the bench for support.\"* When she finally sees Daniel's wings, she describes them as having \"scalloped edges\" and feeling \"softer than the smoothest velvet, the plushest rug.\" This is p. 420. We see another classmate's wings on p. 422: \"They were broad and plush ... with softly scalloped edges.\" Does this sound familiar? Does this sound like we've read this, oh, two pages ago?* \u200e\"Luce could hear the squish of her own mortification as all of Sword & Cross got its viewing of the meat-loaf-coated new girl.\" Let's look at that again: \"THE SQUISH OF HER OWN MORTIFICATION\" Were you aware mortification goes \"squish\"? Well, it does.\"He had a way of standing very still, which made Luce stand very still, which made the ticking sound of the pocket watch inside his blazer seem louder than it possibly could have been.\"Oh, which leads us to: Really shitty analogies/similes/metaphors or just plain confusing writing: * \u200e\"Cam was so much clearer, easier to figure out. Like he was algebra and Daniel was calculus. And she had always loved calculus, the way it sometimes took an hour to figure out a single proof.\" I sort of don't believe Lauren Kate has ever taken calculus. Proofs? In calculus? * \u200e\"His shoulders were hunched over, and yet again, Luce had an instinct to fold herself into them.\" She's going to fold herself into his hunched over shoulders? How, exactly? * \"... and each time his lips left hers, even just for half a second, the most parching thirst ran through her, making her cry out. This time, she knew they were wings, and she left them wrap around her body like a blanket.\" His lips were wings, wrapping around her body like a blanket? No, I'm not an idiot, but this is lazy, unclear writing.Then there are just plain stupid plot elements:* The first time Luce spends alone time with Cam, he takes her on an impromptu picnic. He offers her an apple, and then she sees a snake slithering by. DID YOU SEE WHAT SHE DID THERE?* She's at the reform school because at her previous school, she went away with a boy (Trevor) she liked to a cabin, and a fire broke out, killing the boy. Because she can't remember what exactly happened, the police consider her criminally insane. So they put her on antipsychotics ... and then her family sends her to this reform school. Then in the library at the reform school, another fire bursts out of nowhere, killing a new boy (the Todd mentioned earlier). Is any of this explained? No. Maybe it'll be in the sequel, but I'm not holding my breath.* Apparently she comes back every 17 years, falls in love with Daniel, and dies because of it. And yet he's surprised every 17 years when this happens. Also, his angel buddies are also at the school, and yet they are also all surprised when she shows up. The angel-friends do not at all act unusual until this revelation--it's not being sneaky and stealthy with your plotting, Kate. It's called \"throwing in the plot element 3/4 through the book, which you just thought of right now.\"* So, the entire fate of the world depends upon whether the \"good\" fallen angels or the \"bad\" fallen angels win. And who wins depends on the love of Daniel and Luce and her survival. I don't get it either. If the entire universe's fate were going to depend on one couple and one couple's love, why would it be these two? I'd rather it hinge upon Tom Arnold and Roseanne, and I already KNOW how that story ends. To repeat what I said on someone else's review of this book, if the future of the universe depends entirely on what happens with these two? WE. ARE. FUCKED.* Also, see previous rant in Hush, Hush review about authors taking some responsibility and not making \"dark, brooding, hot-and-cold\" assholes the object of the protagonist's crush. Also, don't make her so fucking stupid. And also, don't define her by her relationship with guys. Seriously. There was no character to Luce except 1) boy crazy and 2) completely stupid.Also, words that are used too often:* kudzu* sulphur* briny* stench* there are more, but I am forgetting. This review is long enough.Bottom line: read for LULZ or if you make it a drinking game. And now I'm off to read the sequel, because I like to rant."}, {"userName": "Maja (The Nocturnal Library)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4551536-maja-the-nocturnal-library", "userReview": "Horrible.

The most sublime of his kind. So much so that he was sometimes called Morning Star. Despite his standing, he was still, of course, considered inferior to the one that created him. This angel decided that it was \"better to reign in hell, than serve in heaven\" and managed to turn fellow angels against the very being they owed their existence to. With his group of angels he waged a war against Heaven and while he lost and was banished become the first of the \"fallen\" angels. This angel, this Morning Star became the ruler of his own domain and himself became a creature feared almost as much as God. Lucifer Morningstar, was the first and the greatest of the fallen angels. So how do the fallen angels of the book Fallen compare?*Sigh*It seems like the fallen angels are starting to replace the vampire as Young Adult's \"it\" creature. However, much like the vampire, people seem to not understand what exactly a fallen angel is or what it means to be a fallen angel. Don't even get me started on Nephilim. I have stated multiple times that I have no problems with writers taking things and making it fit for a young audience, however does everything have to be destroyed? I mean a fallen angel is basically a creature who was exiled from paradise for doing something extremely fucked up. I mean the OG of fallen angels is SATAN! But, enough of that, lets actually talk about the book Fallen. The book is so bad, the cover face-palms itself.Seriously. I at least had someone to root for in the book Shiver. In here I'm struggling to even make it through the book. Basically it's about a seventeen-year-old fool named Luce who can see shadows that no one else can see. Right. One night the shadows attack her when she is kissing this boy named Trevor, burning him alive. Not as cool as it sounds I promise. As a result she is sent to a Nazi-camp under the guise of a reform school called Sword & Cross. Have you felt the symbolism rape yet? Well you will.It is there that she meets her reincarnated love interest named, Daniel Grigori. You felt the symbolism rape that time didn't you? It'll be okay, I promise. The important thing to remember is that it's not your fault. (Hug)However, before Daniel and Luce even speak she is attracted to him, however he proceeds to treat her like a cow-pie, flipping her off the first time they meet. Yet she continues to stalk him, obsess over him and put herself into trouble for him. Remember she just saw a boy being burned alive, she has been stalked by shadows all her life! Hottie just turns that around in an instant. It just irritates me so deeply how Luce allows Daniel to mistreat her throughout the course of the book. Lauren Kate tries to pull a Roman Holiday analogy to explain this obsession, but it fails because, Kate obviously doesn't get why the character of Anne is attracted to Joe in the movie. As a member of royalty, Anne has never had anyone be honest to her and treat her AS A PERSON. NOT A TOILET!The story is just a long, boring rant of her meaningless troubles that perks up at two points, but that wasn't near enough to save the book. The fallen angel part doesn't appear until the end and it is never indicated in the least what terrible thing these people did to get kicked out of Heaven.Also, let me make something very clear: a good fallen angel is an oxymoron. A fallen angel, for simplicities sake, is two steps away from being a demon. Just avoid this book. Seriously. It's not worth the trouble to buy, if you must, get it from the library. At least House of Night has luz, this book was just a series of misses and fail.Final Grade: FLemme explain to you my frustrations with this book with this rant from the main character, Luce. [i]\"I don't get it?\" she asked. I don't get it? Let me tell you something about what I get. You think you're so smart? I spent three years on a full academic scholarship at the best college-prep school in the country. And when they kicked me out, I had to petition-petition! to keep them from wiping out my four-point-oh transcript.\"Daniel moved away, but Luce pursued him, taking a step forward for every wide-eyed step he took back. Probably freaking him out, but so what? He'd been asking for it every time he condescended to her. \"I know Latin and French, and in middle school, I won the science fair three years in a row.\"She had backed him up against the railing of the boardwalk and was trying to restrain herself from poking him in the chest with her finger. She wasn't finished. \"I also do the Sunday crossword puzzle, sometimes in under an hour. I have an unerringly good sense of direction ... though not always when it comes to guys.\"She swallowed and took a moment to catch her breath. \"And someday, I'm going to be a psychiatrist who actually listens to her patients and helps people. Okay? So don't keep talking to me like I'm stupid and don't tell me I don't understand just because I can't decode your erratic, flaky, hot-one- minute-cold-the-next, frankly-\" she looked up at him, letting out her breath-\"really hurtful behavior.\" She brushed a tear away, angry with herself for getting so worked up. \"Shut up,\" Daniel said, but he said it softly and so tenderly that Luce surprised both of them by obeying. [/i]You're smart? Yet you allow a man to walk all over you. Treat you like shit for days, weeks and then fall at his feet when he says go. After ranting and raving about how smart you where was this in practice? No where, because for all that supposed \"knowledge\" there is no COMMON SENSE! I'm sorry, but we are not in kindergarden where when a boy likes you he pulls your pingtails!He treated you like crap so what are you supposed to do, flip him off back and keep on walking! If he starts crying about that he did it because he secretly likes you, tell him to come back once he's mastered communication and aiming into the toilet bowl.Seriously, what type of messages are these books sending to young women?"}, {"userName": "Steph Su", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2010935-steph-su", "userReview": "If FALLEN is the future of YA supernatural fiction, then I fear for this genre. FALLEN is painfully dull and slow, with very little besides the concept of fallen angels and the suggestion of an impossible romance to recommend it to readers.If the plot of FALLEN were to race a glacier, the glacier would win. From the moment Luce arrives at Sword & Cross, the plot feels like it\u2019s always tripping over its own feet in order to explain itself, and to no avail. I don\u2019t mind a gradually building plot if it contains atmosphere and sets up the exposition well, but the setting of Sword & Cross was never fully realized for me, and the events in Luce\u2019s past that landed her at reform school never attained credibility. Luce floats through boarding school life in a series of disconnected and awkwardly written encounters with her schoolmates, none of which helped me understand Luce or any of the other characters. All of the action and scenes required to get the gist of the story occurred within the last 60 pages, and what happened was not worth plodding through 400 pages of irrelevance to get to that point.All of the characters in FALLEN were static and artificial, something that less discerning Twilight-fangirling tweens won\u2019t mind but that more well-read readers will definitely take issue with. Luce is about as passive as a bowl of rice pudding. You think Bella didn\u2019t do anything for three-and-a-half 400-plus-page-long books? Luce just might make Bella look like head of the school spirit squad. She flits from scene to scene, never being fully integrated into the immediacy of the story and never coalescing into a comprehensive character. The thing I most remember about her was that she had short hair from when it got burnt off in a fire. If the way I describe a character is by the length of her hair and not any, I dunno, actual personality traits, you better believe that is a serious problem.Along those same lines, Cam and Daniel were similarly bland male love interests whose only identifiable characteristic was their inexplicable\u2014and inevitable, in this sort of book\u2014attraction to Luce. I constantly got the two mixed up and couldn\u2019t pick them out from a handful of YA male love interests if I had to. I am hardly questioning the appeal of stalker-y, unequal-power-dynamics love\u2014there is a reason why so many of us love bad boys so much\u2014but to have Cam and Daniel be so one-dimensional and predictable, while the story practically insists that we\u2019re supposed to find them heart-stoppingly attractive\u2026sorry, but I really don\u2019t need that.We\u2019ve all heard the quiet rumblings that fallen angels might be the Next Big Thing in YA lit, but only if they\u2019re done right. FALLEN read like a boarding school story with smatterings of the supernatural dashed throughout, the angels-and-demons element only manifesting itself in the final few chapters. It was a discomforting read because it was so detached from those elements of humanity that make even the most fantastical novel relatable: the Southern setting was never fully realized, and the characters were difficult to empathize with.That being said, FALLEN gets two stars from me [UPDATE: nope, not anymore, it's just terrible through and through] because I can totally see its appeal to middle school girls who have devoured the entire Twilight series and now desperately need something to read in between the next House of Night book and the Eclipse movie coming out in Summer 2010. It contains all the elements of a trendy YA bestseller: a paranormal element, a love triangle, two powerful love interests who compete for the same girl. Unfortunately, the great idea was poorly executed, and I won\u2019t be following the rest of this series. However, consider asking your thirteen-year-old sister or cousin for her opinion on FALLEN, and you might get a totally different point of view, one that justifies why Random House believes that FALLEN will be huge in YA."}], "description": "What if the person you were meant to be with could never be yours?17-year-old Lucinda falls in love with a gorgeous, intelligent boy, Daniel, at her new school, the grim, foreboding Sword & Cross . . . only to find out that Daniel is a fallen angel, and that they have spent lifetimes finding and losing one another as good & evil forces plot to keep them apart.
