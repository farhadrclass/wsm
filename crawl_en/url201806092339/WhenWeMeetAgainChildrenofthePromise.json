Again, it's interesting and heartbreaking to learn the history, but I think the author does a good job of helping us picture what life really would have been like for these characters and the cultural challenges and moral dilemmas they faced, as well as the struggles of faith and endurance. Many of the stories and examples are very inspiring for us to apply in our lives.I am inspired by the examples of endurance (one day at a time), encouragement, and forgiveness in POW camps. I'm inspired by the selfless examples of soldiers, medical teams, and peasants putting their lives in danger to help save someone else. The selflessness in the midst of the horrible despair and destruction is incredible. It's interesting to think about all the ways that the war changed the individuals and society as a whole. Life really would never be the same. Many had grown and changed for the better and others longed for the purity of life before the war. The circumstances are different today, but we still face challenges and moral dilemmas and trials that we can also choose to face with faith and love.Here are a few of my favorite quotes from the book:\"I do believe that what we're doing is right and necessary. I hesitate to say that the war is a struggle of good against evil, there's too much evil in all of us to make that kind of claim....American troops are mostly a bunch of civilians who got pulled into this thing, not trained warriors, but what we believe turns out to run pretty deep in us.....What I'm thinking about tonight is the cost of everything we have gone through. I know I'm not the same man I was, and I don't like some of the changes\" (p. 167).\"When this war is over, evil will still be with us. It will be forever, no matter how many wars we fight. I want to find a place where we can make a family and we can try not to be evil ourselves. That's the only war we have a chance to win\" (p. 169).\"He had never seen courage manifested so tangibly on such a grand scale\" (p. 193).\"So what do you believe in? Really?\" (p. 195)\"She had felt her own lack of spirituality and longed to have the Lord touch her, maybe shake her shoulder when she needed it. But today, the idea took on a new perspective. She was so far from home and the things she found comfort in, and she was about to do something sacred: offer her healing touch. She wanted to bring her spirit to this act, so that these boys, some taking their final breaths, would know that life wasn't only ugliness and hatred. She wanted them to know that nobility also existed--goodness and kindness. She didn't want to get caught up in all the bandaging and tugging bodies here and there and forget that it was Easter\" (p. 214).\"She knew the Lord would restore the boy's vision, that in the next life this young face would be made whole, and the boy would be as handsome as he ever had been. But right now his skin was gone, his nose and ears. What mercy he would receive would come later, but for a long time now, he was going to suffer. She told herself that life was a learning experience, and that suffering was actually a kind of sacrament, a holy experience to lift a person to a higher plane, but when she looked at the boy, she could only wonder what he would think when he finally saw himself\" (p. 215).\"What if they had fought this battle without an Easter, without any promise at all?\" (p. 221)\"The German people knew how to endure...He loved their dogged determination to survive....He had felt like a man without a country for quite some time, but this loss seemed to teach him the truth. Every German was an orphan now--with the country so devastated--but the fact was, the homeland wasn't in the buildings. It was in that little girl's spirit--the one who had clung to her little brother. And in the people's will. He felt more hope tonight than he had in a long time\" (p. 257).\"He couldn't help them all...but he would help this family\" (p. 298).\"There were lots of different kinds of victims of this war. When you're out there in the battle, you don't realize how many of them are back at home\" (p. 314).\"We need you. Some of what you say sounds like self-pity, and there's no time for that. We have to put things behind us and get the Church going again\" (p. 329).\"I'm certain that no one here got through this war without wondering at times whether God had given up on us. But we created the war, not God, and now I know that he is waiting to welcome us back to him. I have seen horrifying things in these last two years. You have seen far more, and I know you are suffering now. But God is waiting for us to return to him. We must give him back our hearts\" (p. 331).\"Wally fought the impulse. He didn't want to let Hisitake off the hook that easily. What he had done to them men--to Wally personally--was inexcusable. But then Wally saw that Hisitake was crying...A kind of tingling passed through Wally's body, and he hardly knew what to make of it. It was a spiritual feeling, a change coming over him. Some weight seemed to lift from inside his chest. Wally actually fought it, told himself he didn't want this. He wanted to hate this man, always. But what had started as a hint, an idea, began to build into a powerful emotion, as though his spirit were being altered. He felt calm and right, and the thought that began to fill his head was that he never wanted to hate anyone again\" (p. 397).\"You're the best man I've ever known...I figure I'll never again have a friend as good as you guys\" (p. 418).\"He would never be thankful for the things that had been done to him, but he was thankful for the result. He hoped he would cling to what he had gained\" (p. 426).\"Most of the faith she had possessed, she had learned here at this navy base, or in her ward in Honolulu. She would always be thankful for that. So she said a prayer. She thanked the Lord for the things she had learned, and she prayed that she might not ever lose what she had gained during the war\" (p. 437).\"All these years, all we talked about was the war ending. We didn't take into account all the ways the war would come home with the warriors\" (p. 440).\"How long are we going to feel this way--like everything we get is just too great to believe? I don't want to complain about anything, ever again....He hadn't slept on a bed yet, with sheets, and he hadn't seen his family, but he was almost sure he would always appreciate such simple pleasures for the rest of his life\" (p. 451).\"Through all of these years he had been too intent on surviving to devote much of his mental energy to grieving\" (p. 473)."}, {"userName": "Laura Gubler", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3415766-laura-gubler", "userReview": "American history is my absolute favorite school subject! This is the reason Historical Fiction is my favorite book genre. WWII, however, has always been the part of our history that I only learned what was needed to \"pass the tests\" this being because of all the things that happened to the Jews. It was always a very hard thing for me to think about. I have owned the Children of the Promise book series for over 5 years now and finally brought myself to read them THANKS to my father in law. This book series was absolutely profound to me. I cannot really put into words all the feelings I had while reading these books. There was so many spiritual feelings throughout. So many times I cried for good and for bad. Dean Hughes touches on so many areas of the war all around the world. He stayed as close to the \"real thing\" as I think was possible. So many movies romantisize this war, the biggest war in history but Hughes told it like it was. But at the same time it is not a series that was to hard to read as far as the gore of it all. He gives a very real look into a fictional family and all that they experienced during \"the duration\". I could go on and on. This book series is now and will always be my favorite book series. I would recommend this series to all."}, {"userName": "Sandyr", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1713964-sandyr", "userReview": "I have now finished the entire series and loved all of the books.

Because of the scope of the project, the author does give some exposition (this is especially common when he transitions from one character to another, he'll take a few paragraphs and tell you what is happening both with the character and the war). I understand why he did it and I often skimmed this but it didn't take away from the books in any real way. The character development in this book is so amazing, I have absolutely fallen in love with the Thomas family. The problems the characters face are real life problems that I often didn't have an answer to right away. I love how diverse the cast is and I love the way Hughes has his characters face social problems that really made me think about our world today and how I feel and act.

It gives you a good idea of what it was like during WWII including a perspective of what it was like for a POW, a seargent, a nurse, and rebellious teen. In the following paragraphs I will summarize the book.Alex Thomas is a seargeant for the paratroopers. He served a mission in Germany a few months before the war started so, as you can see, it is a little bit harder for him to be in the army. However, he made a statement saying, \"I told you once that I would never be your enemy,\" to a German friend. He has a fiance back in England who is a German, and faught against Hitler. He gets taken out of his regiment and is sent into the OSS to help scout for places for the paratroopers to land. During his time there, he meets another man named Otto, who is doing this for his grandma, who died in a bombing raid. He tries to survive while helping the paratroopers. How will he survive?Wally Thomas is a POW in Japan. He has been there about 3 years and has survived a variety of sicknesses and beatings that were inflicted upon him. He works in a mine shaft and has to dig out coal and sometimes logs that collapsed with the ceiling. The officers treat them terribly and are treated terribly themselves. In this book, Wally survives a harsh beating, more harsh than usual, which is deadly for the POW's. After that beating, he is taken to be tortured by kneeling on bamboo for however long the officers felt like it. Can he get through it?Bobbi Thomas is a nurse in Hawaii. She is engaged to Richard Hammond, but is questioning how committed he is. She tries to figure out what he is feeling for her, but then David Stinson, her old college professor who she once had feelings for, came along. He had signed up for the marines but he was opening an old wound that had just healed for Bobbi. She likes David very much because he is so devoted to her. Who should she marry?LaRue Thomas, who lives in Sugarhouse, Salt Lake, is having problems with her dad. It is typical teenage stuff like wanting independence to make her own decisions. She is also the most popular, and beautiful, girl in the school and is having problems with who she should date. One day she starts to talk to a boy who she sees at church, but isn't very popular. She goes to him whenever she has a problem. Part of the reason she likes to talk to him is because he can't be manipulated, unlike all of the other boys she flirts with. To make matters worse, she is the LDS stake president's daughter, so her dad is counting on her to set a good example for everyone else. What should she do?I suggest that you read these books if you like WWII, LDS books, adventure, or all of the above. It is definately a book you will want to read. I loved these books and it gives you a pretty good idea of what it was like to be alive during WWII. If you were a German, almost nobody trusted you unless they knew you from before the war, and even then you couldn't always be trusted. Hopefully you will read this book because you're missing out if you don't."}, {"userName": "Ashtynne Degroff", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59641986-ashtynne-degroff", "userReview": "Alex was trying to get to know a guy he was with in his foxhole, when a they were getting attacked by the Germans. Meanwhile in the Philippines, Wally was trying to get better after he was just about killed by the Japanese guards. Bobbi was on a medical boat that was trying to get all of the wounded and move them to Hawaii so they could be safe and try to survive. Alex was soon set out on a new mission that was very crucial and could help stop the war. Then while Alex was preparing for the job, his wife, Anna was giving birth to a baby boy, who they named Gene. Bobbi was about ready to try and get some rest, when suddenly, her ship was attacked and some of the patients, doctors, and the nurses were killed. Wally was soon back working in the mine, and as they were working in the mine, all of the Japanese guards suddenly sent them all back to the train and rumors were spreading like wildfire that the Japanese surrendered and the war was over! The theme for this book is You can always look at good things in a positive way. While the Thomas' family was slowly falling back into place, they all recognized it and were all really grateful for all of the things they were offered. A lot of people really try to stop and be grateful for what they had and that the war was finally coming to a close. Wally had so much to be grateful for and when the war was over, he knew that he would never forget the experiences that he was able to have during the war.  I really liked all of the detail and excitement that this book has to offer. I also love the plot and the whole book altogether. I really thought that this series was the best series in the whole world . (other than Harry Potter) :) I really have nothing bad to say about this book.

I love the way the characters are so believable and the history is so rich..I also love the honest and real lessons and examples that are weaved into the story. One of my very favorite parts of the book was when Wally was at the train station waiting to begin his long journey home after being a POW for three plus years. He watched as a couple of American soldiers humiliated an older Japanese officer by making him take off his boots and sword and taking them from him. He felt sorry for the officer and told him that he was sorry that the men had acted that way..\"The officer took one long look at Wally, then acknowledged his concern by bowing his head. In that instant, Wally felt the same tingling sensation, the same sense of relief he had known when Hisitake had stood before the men, back at the camp. And again the thought filled Wally's head: I never want to hate again. And what was even better, he felt no need to hate. This man was not his enemy, and twice now God had sent him that sweet clarity..the love of a brother. The American boy had a pair of boots that would eventually mean nothing to him, the other a sword, but Wally had a greater gift. He had escaped the bitterness that he had feared he might harbor all his life.\"..Anxious to see how everyone does now that the war is over, but a little sad to be starting the last book in the series."}, {"userName": "Patti", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1913087-patti", "userReview": "\u201cWhen We Meet Again\u201d is #4 in \u201cChildren of the promise\u201d series of five. I liked it just as much as the others, but still had to skim a few of the awful war scenes. Wally\u2019s difficult life as a POW in Japan was hard to read also, but some of that shifts as we find out the impact of dropping of the atomic bomb and its effect on the nation. Now, as the war nears its end, Wally has some major life changes as he survives the terrible ordeal he has experienced.Anna has a sweet baby boy and she has to endure the absence of Alex who must remain in Germany as he helps the country heal. That is not an easy task as so much devastation has destroyed cities and the trauma that has left German citizens utterly poor and desperate. One of the things I like about Hughes\u2019 story is that of the challenges of an LDS family. Not all is perfect and Pres. and Sis. Thomas must struggle to work together, and to deal with everyday problems. So much they deal with is true life. Nothing is sugarcoated in this close family.I love that there is a Book #5 to see the family healing.

Dean Hughes has a way of weaving intriguing details of history into human stories to remind us that these events didn't just occur, but they impacted people. He obviously has a wonderful observant eye and knack for using the right word or phrase to describe the way people are, how they feel, and what they are experiencing. I feel better able to relate to people because of this book--which is a main reason why I read. From the earlier books, I knew that Hughes was an excellent story teller, but I believe he is more than that. He is able to represent many types of people, what feels like in an accurate way, and he honestly portrays them with faults included. Hughes addresses ideas that are not just important for the period (World War II), but for us today. Many things that were happening then are still impacting us today.Well done!

She's doing fascinating work as a nurse in Pearl Harbor and then on a naval hospital ship, but all she can think about is whether she likes Richard enough to marry him (assuming they both survive the war).

I love all of the characters, and I've learned even more about World War II. I read a part of the book and think it is as good as it gets, and I want it to keep on going, but then the next part is more exciting, and even better. I love the Thomas family, and love reading more about them. Volume 4, When We Meet Again is a great book, and I couldn't put it down! I especially liked reading about Wally, who was in a Japanese POW camp. But then again, I liked it all!"}, {"userName": "Christina", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/334273-christina", "userReview": "LaRue is beginning to realize she doesn't like who she has become. Wally is struggling as a POW, then the camp is liberated. Even though the war has ended, Alex is asked to remain in Germany to help. Bobbie and Richard are engaged, and Peter is alive but cannot find his family.The entire series is well researched and in depth. He does a good job of placing characters in many of the important events of the war (sometimes he's even a little too obvious about it). The characters are multi-faceted and develop well as the series goes on."}, {"userName": "Marie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1562106-marie", "userReview": "This is another in this series I love, and it has been the best yet. It was hard to put down, it was so riveting. Perhaps it was because he is a good writer, which he is; perhaps it was because the ship in the Pacific was at Iwa Jima, as my own dad's ship was; perhaps it was because this long, hard world war was coming to an end. Whatever the reason, I was glued. I think I should probably keep it around for those self-pity times I might start to engage in, and remember how extremely hard people had it/how much suffering happened all over the world during and after WWII."}], "description": "The Thomas family members face ongoing challenges in the dark years at the close of WW2. Alex's values are tested as he works to complete an intelligence assignment in Germany while wondering if he'll ever see his beloved Anna and their son again. Wally struggles to survive the torture he endures as a POW, and Bobbi has to make a difficult choice between the men in her life. Back home in Utah, LaRue and her father, President Alexander Thomas, have drawn their own battle lines.", "title": "When We Meet Again\n      \n          (Children of the Promise #4)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1207895.When_We_Meet_Again", "average": 4.31, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388427103l/1207895.jpg", "reviews": 178, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6421982.Dean_Hughes", "name": "Dean Hughes"}], "type": ["Historical", "Lds", "Christianity", "Fiction", "Religion"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1207895.When_We_Meet_Again", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/571508.Rumors_of_War", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/571512.Since_You_Went_Away", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1238338.As_Long_As_I_Have_You", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/433160.Far_From_Home", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1238339.The_Writing_on_the_Wall", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31160055-the-last-cherry-blossom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26583370-life-and-other-near-death-experiences", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20552595-how-i-became-a-famous-novelist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
