This was my favorite so far and it was really dramatic and tense. It read like an episode of Criminal minds. Gabby isn't looking for any mysteries this time. She's just concerned with getting crime scenes cleaned up with her main helper away on s honeymoon. But her fiance Riley was a top prosecutor in California before he moved to Virginia to a practice to help others less fortunate. But a serial killer he put away in his old life has escaped prison and is a very wily cold-blooded killer. He has determined to make Riley pay by going after anybody close to Riley, and in turn, to anybody close to Gabby. The suspense in this book is fierce! In one scene I just shuddered when Gabby awoke in her bed to find the serial killer on top of her. And the final scene is enough to give one nightmares!"}, {"userName": "JaneReads", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5179050-janereads", "userReview": "This book was tense. Not one to read before going to bed because you just might not be able to sleep. Every chapter ends with a cliff-hanger which drew you into wanting to continue reading to find out what was going to happen next. A serial killer has escaped from prison and has Riley and Gabby in his sights and always seems to be one step ahead of them. When Riley and Gabby found the murderer's hideout I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see if there were going to be able to catch him or would the he follow through on his revenge plan. I liked the ending, but I have a feeling that this might not be last we have heard of this killer. I look forward to the next book and hope Riley and Grabby finally get their happy ending."}, {"userName": "Suzie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7431258-suzie", "userReview": "I know I've said this in pretty much every review I have posted on The Squeaky Clean Mysteries series but I love this main character. Gabby St. Clair is intelligent, up on her pop culture and musicals and humorously sarcastic and snarky. She reminds me a little bit of Veronica Mars.In \"The Scum of All Fears,\" we get to see a little more involvement from Riley Thomas, Gabby's fiance, as well. Gabby and Riley seem to be working more as a team in this book and it works. It shows how their relationship has evolved. It's been a pretty full year for Gabby and Riley as all five books take place over the course of a year but I really hope there will be more of their adventures in the future."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2521894-laura", "userReview": "THE SCUM OF ALL FEARS is book five in Ms. Barritt's Squeaky Clean Mystery series, but it easily stands alone. THE SCUM OF ALL FEARS is edge of your seat fiction that held my attention from start to finish. Scary at times and with plenty of twists I never saw coming. This read a lot like a horror -- almost two scary for me. I was totally engrossed though and couldn't put it down. I enjoyed getting reacquainted with Gabby and Riley and going through this mystery with them."}, {"userName": "Cathy Daniel", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7218096-cathy-daniel", "userReview": "This one was creepy since it involved a serial killer but an excellent book!

Gabby is growing up a little and not quite so willing to jump and search for mysteries herself. She is trusting others a little more in this book. Plus, this is the first book in this series that you know from the beginning who the killer is. Only bad part is this mystery isn\u2019t completely wrapped up and now I have to go on to the next book to find the answer. I suppose there are worse things in this world than being stuck reading yet another book."}, {"userName": "Regina Watts", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50795888-regina-watts", "userReview": "Great StorylineI love the storyline with making it appear there could be several accomplices.

Book 5 had all of these qualities, but was just way to intense for me to consider it to be a \"cozy\" mystery. And maybe that's not what the author intended. It was too scary (for lack of a better word) for me to enjoy. That said, the book was clean as far as language & morality go."}, {"userName": "Doreen Marr", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39211932-doreen-marr", "userReview": "Christy has done it again with Book #5 in her Squeaky Clean Series! Gabby, crime scene cleaner, seems to run into trouble everywhere she goes, but this time trouble comes to her from out of Riley's past. Will a serial killer be able to scare Gabby off? Will Riley and Gabby be able to stop him before he kills people close to Gabby?

This story was quite suspenseful, but still a quick, easy read. I recommend these books to anyone from teens and older who loves mysteries and crime solving. The Christian growth in Gabby is great; she reminds us to pray all the time too.I gave it four stars because at times the actions and/or thought processes were a little wordy.

They have suspense that keeps you guessing. There is also subtle romance that makes you wish you were Gabby.

The Scum of All Fears was scary from the first page! Gabby learns a killer has escaped who tortures and murders women. It seems to be starting again.
