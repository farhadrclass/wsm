And the premise, that characters can exist in the \"real world\" outside of books, or that real people can enter the world inside a book, is endlessly appealing. However, my local library is on the verge of opening a new wing with my overdue book fines on this, because I keep hanging onto it in the hope that eventually I will be able to finish reading it.I think it's just not going to happen. First of all, there is something very stilted and anachronistic in the writing, and I can't tell whether that's just Cornelia Funke, or a result of the translation work. Also, the book is simply too long. It takes 150 pages for anything to begin to happen, and that's much too long, even for an adult book. I blame J.K. Rowling for this kind of bloating.Finally, I'm extremely annoyed by people, whether real or fictional, who pat themselves on the back for loving books. People have loved books for as long as there have been books, and even before books, people loved storytelling and drama. You're not a special kind of intellect for loving books and wordplay. The people in Inkheart are paraded before us as people with an extra special super duper love of books that is so powerful that they can cause the boundary between books and reality to melt. But just carrying around favorite books in a little trunk and bragging you've loved books since you were a baby and could read before you could talk and so forth isn't particularly magical or distinctive or worthy of praise, and I got tired pretty quickly of Meggie and her father and aunt and their extreme reverence for books. Capping it off is Funke's annoying habit of using an epigram from other (mostly fantasy) books for each chapter. If she found those inspiring, fine, stick them on your bulletin board while writing. But they were yet more reason to jump out of the story, rather than having it propel along."}, {"userName": "Dana", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/937025-dana", "userReview": "Oy... I really wanted to like this book. I had such high hopes for it. It was one of those books that whenever my students saw me reading it they said, \"Oh, I really liked that book! It was so good.\" So, I thought it would be great. It just wasn't. The story was nice. In short (very short): Meggie's father repairs books. Her mother disappeared nine years ago. After a mysterious visitor shows up at their house, Meggie finds out that her father has a secret. He can read characters out of books. Nine years ago he was reading aloud and read a terrible villian out of the book and simultaneously read Meggie's mother into the book. The rest of the story is Meggie and her father trying to defeat the villian and maybe get her mother back. Overall... it was a great idea for a book, it just wasn't particularly well excecuted. I can't exactly place my finger on what I didn't like, but it just didn't sit well with me. I think it was the lack of character development. I didn't feel like I really knew the characters. I also felt like I couldnt' quite picture what was happening. I wanted more description-strange for such a long novel. And overall, it was just too long. I felt like it really dragged. I wanted it to move more quickly and have a bit more action. Great premise, but I'm not super excited to read the next one."}, {"userName": "Patricia (theinfophile)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/238451-patricia-theinfophile", "userReview": "This book is everything I ever wanted.

I was driven to read more by both the action/adventure and the plot/conclusion. Both are excellently written! Funke\u2019s style of writing (and indeed the translation made by Anthea Bell) makes for a smooth and beautiful read.Wonderfully drawn and very detailed characters fill this book from cover to cover, each character being unique and complete. The story is told from multiple viewpoints, which adds another interesting dimension to the story and plot.The book doesn\u2019t contain many light-hearted chapters (as you would find in Harry Potter or Narnia) but the wonderful lead characters are such good people that the book is far from dark.The whole idea of the story is beautiful and intriguing! And the quotes that begin each chapter are perfectly chosen.I kept wondering if there were areas that Funke could have taken out to make the book shorter \u2013 but I couldn\u2019t really find anything that wouldn\u2019t mar the story in some way, and I was grateful there were as many pages to read as there were!A wonderful read and an interesting story that I think has become a new favorite! ***I've read through chapter 16 now, and things have begun to be explained. The book is so very dear, and so very addicting! I now am not at all concerned with finishing it by the movie's release date!:D***I plan to begin this book today. I've got so many others that I'm in the midst of reading right now, but the fact that I want to finish this before the movie comes out (eek!) I'd best hurry up and start it!!***Oh dear!! I'd totally blanked and forgotten that this was being made into a movie!! I saw in the paper today that it's being released in mid-March. While this is wonderful, it means that I'd better hurry up and read it!!!"}, {"userName": "Miranda Reads", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71848701-miranda-reads", "userReview": "Books have to be heavy because the whole world's inside them.\n\nMagic, this book is pure unadulterated magic.There is something inexplicable about the way Funke weaves magic into the real world. There's something so heartwarming and true regarding the dynamic between Maggie and her father, Mo. Even the crankiness of Eleanor as she begrudgingly takes in Maggie is enough to set my eyes alight as I read, and reread this book.Perhaps, it is because (for the first time) characters in a book loved reading as much as I do\nWhen you open a book it's like going to the theater first you see the curtain then it is pulled aside and the show begins.\nWhen a mysterious friend from Mo's past shows up on their doorstep, he packs up all of their things and whisks Maggie away to to her Aunt Elinor's house. Evil is circling ever closer to their little family and Maggie is at a complete loss at what to do. She's read countless stories of heroines ... but to actually become one? That will take pure bravery and nerves of steel.Even after all these years, as soon as I read this book, I check the garden for fairies and glassmen.\nIs there anything in the world better than words on the page?\nAudiobook CommentsRead by Lynn Redgrave - and she did a rather good job.

Not like me at all.I liked the storyline. I love the fact that it is a book about books, and that is what initially made me want to read it. I read the blurb on the book and it sounded like a really fun read.I was wrong.The book was VERY long-winded. Whilst the plotline was good, and the characters were nicely built, the actual story dragged on most of the time. The best part of the book is the last few chapters, by which point I didn't care - I just wanted the book to end so I could move onto something more enjoyable.I've given it 2 stars because the story is interesting, I just think that it could have been condensed into less pages. Either that or the writing could have had more cliffhangers - therefore making it more unputdownable. Maybe if I could read German, the original book may be more enticing. It's always possible with translations that the book doesn't end up coming across as the author intended it to. I guess I'll never know.I have no desire whatsoever to read the other books. I think this generally works on its own as a standalone novel, but the thought of reading another 500 pages doesn't fill me with joy."}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani", "userReview": "Tintenherz = Inkheart (Inkworld, #1), Cornelia Funke Inkheart (German title: Tintenherz) is a 2003 young adult fantasy novel by Cornelia Funke, and the first book of the Inkheart trilogy. Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association named the book one of its \"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children.\" Meggie, a girl at the age of 12, sees a stranger staring at her outside her window and tells her father, Mortimer (or Mo, as Meggie calls him) about it. Her father invites the stranger in, who introduces himself as Dustfinger. Mo and Dustfinger go to Mo's workshop, where Mo works as a bookbinder. Meggie eavesdrops and hears them talking about unfamiliar people and places, such as a man named Capricorn. The next morning, Mo unexpectedly announces that he and Meggie have to go to Meggie's Aunt Elinor's house where Mo has to fix some books. They bring along their camper; eventually, they find Dustfinger on the road, who climbs onto the camper to journey with Meggie and Mo to Elinor's house. When they arrive, Elinor seems displeased, but lets them in. Her house, like Mo and Meggie's, is full of books. Mo sets off to work, and Meggie talks much to Dustfinger, where she is introduced to Dustfinger's pet, Gwin, a marten with horns on top of his head. One day, he puts on a show for her at night, claiming to be an entertainer and a fire-eater. A short while after, Mo is captured by people with unusual names, bringing along with him a book, Inkheart, that the previously mentioned Capricorn is desperate to get his hands on. Meggie and Elinor tell the police, but the police just think they are out of their minds. ...\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627: \u0642\u0644\u0628 \u062c\u0648\u0647\u0631\u06cc\u061b \u0633\u06cc\u0627\u0647 \u062f\u0644\u061b \u0633\u06cc\u0627\u0647 \u0642\u0644\u0628\u061b \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647: \u06a9\u0648\u0631\u0646\u0644\u06cc\u0627 \u06a9\u0627\u0631\u0648\u0644\u06cc\u0646\u0647 \u0641\u0648\u0646\u06a9\u0647\u061b \u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0646\u062e\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0634: \u0628\u06cc\u0633\u062a \u0648 \u0686\u0647\u0627\u0631\u0645 \u0698\u0627\u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0647 \u0633\u0627\u0644 2010 \u0645\u06cc\u0644\u0627\u062f\u06cc\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u0642\u0644\u0628 \u062c\u0648\u0647\u0631\u06cc - \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 1 \u0627\u0632 \u0633\u0647 \u06af\u0627\u0646\u0647\u061b \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647: \u06a9\u0648\u0631\u0646\u0644\u06cc\u0627 \u06a9\u0627\u0631\u0648\u0644\u06cc\u0646\u0647 \u0641\u0648\u0646\u06a9\u0647\u061b \u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645: \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0646\u0648\u0631\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\u06cc\u061b \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0628\u0647\u0646\u0627\u0645\u060c 1388\u061b \u062f\u0631 607 \u0635\u060c \u0645\u0635\u0648\u0631\u060c \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645\u0647 \u0627\u0632 \u0646\u0633\u062e\u0647 \u06cc \u0627\u0646\u06af\u0644\u06cc\u0633\u06cc \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645\u0647 \u0634\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u061b \u0634\u0627\u0628\u06a9: 9789645668585\u061b \u0645\u0648\u0636\u0648\u0639: \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u06af\u0627\u0646 \u0622\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0642\u0631\u0646 21 \u0645\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u0633\u06cc\u0627\u0647 \u062f\u0644 - \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 1 \u0627\u0632 \u0633\u0647 \u06af\u0627\u0646\u0647\u061b \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647: \u06a9\u0648\u0631\u0646\u0644\u06cc\u0627 \u06a9\u0627\u0631\u0648\u0644\u06cc\u0646\u0647 \u0641\u0648\u0646\u06a9\u0647\u061b \u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645: \u0634\u0642\u0627\u06cc\u0642 \u0642\u0646\u062f\u0647\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u061b \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646\u060c \u06a9\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0646 \u067e\u0631\u0648\u0631\u0634 \u0641\u06a9\u0631\u06cc \u06a9\u0648\u062f\u06a9\u0627\u0646 \u0648 \u0646\u0648\u062c\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0646\u060c 1388\u061b \u062f\u0631 587 \u0635\u060c \u0645\u0635\u0648\u0631\u060c \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645\u0647 \u0627\u0632 \u0646\u0633\u062e\u0647 \u06cc \u0627\u0646\u06af\u0644\u06cc\u0633\u06cc \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645\u0647 \u0634\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u061b \u0634\u0627\u0628\u06a9: 9789643914103\u061b \u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u0633\u06cc\u0627\u0647 \u0642\u0644\u0628 - \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 1 \u0627\u0632 \u0633\u0647 \u06af\u0627\u0646\u0647\u061b \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647: \u06a9\u0648\u0631\u0646\u0644\u06cc\u0627 \u06a9\u0627\u0631\u0648\u0644\u06cc\u0646\u0647 \u0641\u0648\u0646\u06a9\u0647\u061b \u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645: \u061b \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0627\u0641\u0642\u060c 1391\u061b \u062f\u0631 595 \u0635\u060c \u0645\u0635\u0648\u0631\u060c \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645\u0647 \u0627\u0632 \u0646\u0633\u062e\u0647 \u06cc \u0627\u0646\u06af\u0644\u06cc\u0633\u06cc \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645\u0647 \u0634\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u061b \u0634\u0627\u0628\u06a9: 9789643698553\u061b \u0633\u0647 \u06af\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0633\u06cc\u0627\u0647 \u0642\u0644\u0628: \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0646\u062e\u0633\u062a: \u0633\u06cc\u0627\u0647 \u0642\u0644\u0628 (2003 \u0645\u06cc\u0644\u0627\u062f\u06cc)\u061b \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u062f\u0648\u0645: \u0633\u06cc\u0627\u0647 \u062e\u0648\u0646 (2006 \u0645\u06cc\u0644\u0627\u062f\u06cc)\u061b \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0633\u0648\u0645: \u0633\u06cc\u0627\u0647 \u0645\u0631\u06af (2008 \u0645\u06cc\u0644\u0627\u062f\u06cc)\u061b \u0627. \u0634\u0631\u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u06cc"}, {"userName": "Hirdesh", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13506550-hirdesh", "userReview": "The best fantasy novel, I'ver read.I was too much curious while reading that.I just loved it.The way writer moves the story.Specially,3 ratings for character making.Thanks Cornelia Funke."}, {"userName": "Patrick", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/922495-patrick", "userReview": "Enjoyed it well enough.

A book about a magical book!!How delightful! Twelve year old Meggie lives in a small farmhouse with her father, Mo, as Meggie calls him, who repairs and restores books. Meggie doesn't think that 'bookbinder' describes the care and love her father takes when he's fixing books and prefers to say that he's a \"book doctor.\" He has a plaque on the bookshop door that reads:\nSome books should be tastedsome devoured but only a few should be chewed and digested thoroughly.\nOne dark and rainy night, a stranger arrives at the door. Mo invites him in, saying he's a \"friend\" and sends Meggie roughly back to bed. Mo has never treated her that way but more than that, Meggie senses fear, like icy fingers around her heart, and a feeling of foreboding surrounding the visitor. And something else, a familiarity deep down that she can't explain. What kind of friend comes knocking in the middle of the night? Not easily dissuaded, Meggie creeps out of bed and listens through the door. She hears Mo call the visitor Dustfinger who then calls her father Silvertongue. Then the voices become only low murmurs, a hushed argument of sorts. \"don't underestimate him\" she heard Dustfinger say. \"He'd do anything to get hold of it\" .....\"And when I say 'anything,' I can assure you I mean anything.\"......\"I'll never let him have it.\" That was Mo. ...\"Oh, yes? And for how much longer, do you think? What about your daughter?....Meggie wonders what the strange names mean, including the other one Dustfinger said \"Capricorn\" and what could he want that Mo will never give up? Very early the next morning Mo tells Meggie to pack quickly, that they're going to visit his aunt Elinor who needs some of her books repaired. Meggie is confused as she still has a week of school left but Mo, not in the mood to argue, has been unusually distressed since Dustfinger's arrival and is clearly in a hurry to leave.And, as always, he reminds her to pack plenty of books to read. He's always says \n\"It's a good idea to have your own books with you when you're in a strange place.\"\nThey just reach the gate when Dustfinger suddenly appears in the road and says he's coming along. This seems to upset Mo even more and Meggie, still fearful, isn't at all happy, either. As the journey lags on the discord between Mo and Dustfinger continues and Meggie knows something is being kept secret from her, something to do with a book she saw Mo hide in his suitcase, something that has Mo very anxious and worried. Elinor's house is enormous with bookshelves full of books, floor to ceiling in every room. In addition, Elinor makes it very apparent that she doesn't care for children. Not at all. Late that first night Meggie hears Mo and Elinor whispering about hiding the book so it can never be found. Only a little while later, that very night, men come and steal the book, taking Mo with them. The book was indeed kept safe and the men will soon discover that they have the wrong book. What will happen to Mo then? Elinor dislikes and doesn't trust Dustfinger but he says he knows where Mo has been taken leaving Meggie and Elinor no choice but to trust him to take them to exchange the book for Mo. Elinor finds she was right not to trust Dustfinger as he's deceived them, leading them right into a trap. They've been taken by gun point and reunited with Mo but are now locked up, terrified, and at the complete mercy of Capricorn. Mo has no choice but to tell Maggie the secret he's been hiding, why he's never read out loud to her, and about what really happened to her mother when Meggie was just three years old. Mo explains to Meggie that he can literally read characters out of a book. Mo was reading INKHART aloud to Meggie's mother when suddenly Capricorn appeared in their living room, along with a few of his men. And her mother was gone. Vanished. Mo managed to escape with Meggie, and the book and has been hiding from Capricorn ever since. Now, Meggie and Elinor are beginning to understand why Capricorn won't let them go now that he has the book. He needs Mo to read aloud everything he wants out of the book including gold and treasure. Dustfinger, too, has his own selfish adjenda for getting his hands on the book as he, himself, was read from the pages of INKHEART, and he wants to go back. More than anything in this world. Mo has refused to do what Capricorn wants thus far. And for good reason. But now, thanks to Dustfinger, Capricorn finally has everything he needs to make Mo obey. He has his Daughter, Meggie. And that's just the beginning. Inkheart by Cornelia Funke is a magical adventure that I found very hard to put down.It was everything a great story should be. A believable story line with magic for added fun and adventure. Endearing characters in Mo, Meggie, and Elinor who have me looking forward to reading their further adventures in Inkspell. Characters who are merciless and evil, who have no quandary about deceit, ruthlessness, and murder. It all goes flat out which I found surprising as it's a 500+ page book. It's an exciting and original story with lots of uncertainty and anticipation throughout that never loses momentum and keeps you guessing from beginning to end. I was drawn straight in and I found myself captivated within the pages for hours on end, turning the pages as fast as could to see what might happen next. I got goose bumps on countless occasions! Oh! What a sensational adventure!! I highly recommend it to anyone who loves books. Books to read, collect, and treasure."}, {"userName": "Maia", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/846976-maia", "userReview": "Okay, I'm at hundred pages, and I'm like: someone just kill that loser Capricorn, and then FedEx the rest of the gang home!

So this review is going to be of the first half of \"Inkheart\". This was a truly magical story that I know I would've absolutely adored as a child. It's about a love for books, and it's about how we - as readers - step into a fictional world, and how this fictional world can sometimes come true. I loved this story; especially the first 150 pages where the characters and setting are introduced. That being said, it did take me some effort to get through the last part (of this first part) of the book. As I said, I think I would've loved this book as a child, but reading it now as an adult made me a bit bored at this big escape that the characters are going on. I think I would've been perfectly happy if Meggie and her father Mo could've just stayed at home with their books and each other, because while the beginning of the big adventure was interesting, it did drag on for a bit too long in my opinion. Knowing that the second part of this book will probably just pick up from where part one ended, I'm not sure I'm going to pick it up anytime soon. Now, I know what the story and the characters are like, and I don't feel an urgent need to read the rest of it. BUT I still think that this is a magical story that will take you on quite a fictional adventure, and I'm happy that I got to know Meggie and Mo and their love for books."}, {"userName": "Kathryn", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/446464-kathryn", "userReview": "A wonderful, imaginative story.

Which book addict doesn\u2019t know the feeling that the characters in a book can seem more real than the people around us? And there is of course a simple reason for that.

A lovely fantasy tale, with just enough villains and heroic folks to keep it balanced. You root for a happy ending and keep reading. Each chapter starts with a quote from a beloved children's classic, so you get to visit old friends on the journey through the story.A few passages helped assure me how much the author really does love books and all they represent. Meggie, tired and distressed at one point, wearily \"took out a book and tried to make herself a nice nest in its familiar words.\" Any book lover should be able to identify with that! Or later, Elinor, when trying to get comfortable in the ruins of a deserted cottage, ponders, \"Why are adventures so much more fun when you read about them?\"But perhaps my favorite is:\nOnly in books could you find pity, comfort, happiness--and love. Books loved anyone who opened them, they gave you security and friendship and didn't ask anything in return; they never went away, never, not even when you treated them badly. \nLove, truth, beauty, wisdom and consolation against death.

Her dad, Mo, is a book doctor, rebinding books that have seen better days. Books are what the two bond over, are what they decorate their home with, and are how they relate to the world around them. But Mo has never ever read aloud to his daughter, that she can remember, and in the pages of Inkheart Meggie discovers his reasons.\u201cSome books should be tasted, some devoured, but only a few should be chewed and digested thoroughly.\u201dThis was a wonderful adventure, and is one that I\u2019ve taken before and look forward to taking again. As I\u2019ve said time and again, I love books about books. And Inkheart is an ode to the written word if ever there was one. However, Inkheart isn\u2019t just a long song to stories, but to the physical books that house them. I\u2019m a big believer in e-readers, especially for their portability, but nothing will ever take the place of a physical book for me. The sound of the pages, the smell of the ink, the texture of raised letters on a cover, the beauty of spines lined up on a shelf, can never be replaced by an electronic document. There\u2019s just something about taking a book down off a shelf and knowing that you\u2019re holding an entire world in your hands that an incredibly heady feeling.\u201cIf you take a book with you on a journey, an odd thing happens: the book begins collecting your memories. And forever after you have only to open the book to be back where you first read it. It will all come into your mind with the very first words: the sights you saw in that place, what it smelled like, the ice-cream you ate while you were reading it \u2026 yes, books are like flypapers. Memories cling to the printed page better than anything else.\u201dThe above quote is so true. If I pick up my Edgar Allen Poe collection, I remember being ten years old and reading \u201cThe Tell-Tale Heart\u201d for the first time while hiding under the covers with a flashlight. When I open Ender\u2019s Game, I remember sitting in alone in a Gifted classroom during my 5th grade year, reading through tears because Ender made me feel less alone. I remember reading Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire in one day, when I had to stay home from school sick with the flu. Flowers for Algernon will always bring back to mind a road trip to Tennessee right after I graduated from college. Books matter. They really do preserve memories better than anything else, be those memories flower petals pressed between pages or personal memories that reside right inside the cover.The fictional Inkheart novel inside of this book was also wonderful. I adore books about books that don\u2019t actually exist, especially this one, The Princess Bride, and The Shadow of the Wind. I always wish I could somehow reach into the book I\u2019m reading and pull out the fictional book within it, but alas. Inkheart is populated with fairies, trolls, little glass people, murderers, fire-breathers, and magic. It was a wonderful addition to the story of a man who could read things right out of the pages he held in his hands.I was afraid that I wouldn\u2019t enjoy this book as much on a reread, but thankfully I was mistaken. There was still just as much magic housed in its pages. And it\u2019s a magic that I heartily recommend sharing with any children in your life, especially those who already love books. I can\u2019t wait for my niece to be old enough to experience the magic that can be found within the written world.\u201cIs there anything in the world better than words on a page? Magic signs, the voices of the dead, building blocks to make wonderful worlds better than this one, comforters, companions in loneliness. Keepers of secrets, speakers of the truth \u2026 all those glorious words.\u201dOriginal review can be found at Booknest."}, {"userName": "Tatiana", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2250020-tatiana", "userReview": "As much as I hate to say it, but this book is really boring. I love children's books and read Harry Potter and His Dark Materials several times. Inkheart disappointed me. I never stop reading a book until I read at least 100 pages, to give an author a chance to develop a story. Unfortunately, I had to stop reading this book after page 150. It is extremely slowpaced and uneventful. It is surprising to know that kids actually have enough patience to finish and thoroughly enjoy this book. Maybe it's just not my cup of tea..."}, {"userName": "Kelly ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24407332-kelly", "userReview": "Ah, what a great ending to a lovely book.

Cornelia Funke has crafted a wonderful, if a bit dark, storyline filled with colorful and memorable characters, both hero and villain. I liked the blend of modern day with fantasy in this story and having the magical element of being able to read characters out of their individual stories was brilliant.The storyline itself moves along nicely as Meggie and her father, Mo, go on an adventure both to escape danger and hopefully to find Meggie's mother, who was read into Inkheart mistakenly by Mo in the same instant that he, also accidentally, brought forth some very evil villains.The story itself is very compelling, but what really makes this book are the wonderful and interesting characters that are sprinkled throughout the novel. From the heroes: Meggie and Mo, Dustfinger and great-aunt Elinor, to the evil Capricorn and his henchman, the knife-wielding Bast, along with many, many more, I found the characters to leap off of the page (just not actually into my living room!)Overall, a magical adventure and wonderful addition to the young adult fantasy genre that I would recommend to young and old alike. There are a few fairly scary moments, so I would be a bit cautious with children under 10, but use your own judgement."}, {"userName": "Ova Incekaraoglu", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5316099-ova-incekaraoglu", "userReview": "One of my favourite fantasy / middle grade books as it is totally gripping from start to finish and very fun to read.

Dalla storia ai personaggi, allo stile dell'autrice."}, {"userName": "Erika", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42404222-erika", "userReview": "Mi ricordo ancora di cosa mi ha portato a leggere questo libro: due mie amiche di universit\u00e0 me l'hanno consigliato fino allo sfinimento sapendo che avevo visto solo il film. \"Merita tantissimo\", mi dicevano. \"DEVI LEGGERLO!\", mi ripetevano costantemente. E, alla fine, ho ceduto e devo ammettere che \u00e8 stata una delle scelte pi\u00f9 ben fatte in vita mia.Mi affido alla mia amata recensione per lista, perch\u00e9 le cose da dire sono talmente tante che ho paura di scordarmene qualcuna in un lungo discorso senza interruzioni:- Lo stile di scrittura \u00e8 favoloso. Altamente descrittivo, ricco e, in poche parole, fantastico. Cornelia Funke costruisce un intero mondo come se non facesse nemmeno un briciolo di fatica, come se l'avesse visitato per davvero in un sogno e poi avesse deciso di scriverci una storia su. E' uno stile di scrittura che affascina, che mi ha fatto ritornare bambina e che mi ha emozionato molto. L'unica pecca e pregio (per quanto strano possa sembrare questo doppio giudizio) \u00e8 che \u00e8 molto lento; Da una parte \u00e8 una pecca, perch\u00e9 sembra quasi che il libro non finisca mai, ma dall'altra invece \u00e8 un enorme pregio perch\u00e9 quando si tratta di Cornelia Funke io non sono mai pronta ad abbandonare il suo mondo, i suoi personaggi e le sue storie quindi \u00e8 un aspetto che apprezzo comunque tantissimo. - I personaggi sono tra i migliori di cui io abbia mai letto. Sono quel tipo di persone che vorrei incontrare nella vita di tutti i giorni (ad eccezione degli antagonisti, ovviamente) e con cui passerei delle ore a parlare, parlare e parlare. Mi rivedo molto, in particolare, in Mo e Meggie, i quali hanno una grandissima passione per i libri e per la lettura. -- Il mio preferito, per\u00f2, resta Dita di Polvere. La Funke, creando Dita di Polvere, ha creato un vero e proprio capolavoro. Non esiste un personaggio meglio caratterizzato di lui: \u00e8 affascinante, impavido, sconsiderato, scaltro, esilarante e porta con s\u00e8 quel pizzico di magia che lo rende ancora pi\u00f9 interessante ed eclettico. - Con le sue descrizioni la Funke apre una finestra sul mondo che sta creando e mi sembrava quasi di essere fagocitata dalle pagine e di assistere alla storia in prima linea. Con le sue parole l'autrice mi ha fatto sentire il sole sulla pelle, la ghiaia dura sotto i piedi nudi, il calore del fuoco sulle dita di Dita di Polvere e la magia che, come un mantello, copre interamente la storia. Questo \u00e8 un libro che si legge con tutti e cinque i sensi all'erta, un libro che ti coinvolge mentalmente, fisicamente ed emozionalmente.- La trama \u00e8 originalissima e non esiste nient'altro del genere al mondo. In questo libro non ho trovato quei clich\u00e9 che si ripetono costantemente in ormai quasi tutti i romanzi che leggo. Ogni cosa era per me una sorpresa e i colpi di scena non sono mai mancati!- Ho adorato l'importanza che viene data ad ogni singolo personaggio, come se ognuno di loro avesse uno scopo all'interno della storia. Nessuno \u00e8 stato trascurato e ognuno ha avuto il suo spazio nel corso del libro, com'\u00e8 giusto che sia.- Mi \u00e8 piaciuto moltissimo il rapporto tra Mo e Meggie, padre e figlia, e dalle parole della Funke traspariva proprio l'amore e il bene che provano l'uno per l'altra. -- Ho apprezzato molto anche il rapporto di amicizia che si va ad instaurare con gli altri personaggi e la naturalezza con cui si trovano ad affrontare insieme, con immenso coraggio, delle situazioni che li mettono in pericolo di morte.- L'azione non \u00e8 mai mancata e l'autrice \u00e8 riuscita a coinvolgermi perfettamente nel romanzo, tanto che mi sono ritrovata a provare quello che provavano i nostri personaggi. Mi \u00e8 quasi sembrato, inoltre, di essere parte della storia io stessa.Insomma, come avrete potuto capire, ho adorato questo libro in maniera spropositata. E' uno dei libri che preferisco al mondo e lo porter\u00f2 sempre nel cuore. Consigliatissimo!"}, {"userName": "Mike (the Paladin)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin", "userReview": "Excellent book (haven't seen the movie). A youth book, I looked forward to getting the sequels and grabbed them as soon as they were available. Dropping back to add this.I'm surprised how different tastes can be. I really liked this book (and its sequels)and was very surprised to see the negative reviews. I didn't find the book ever dragged and while I did find the characters annoying at times, it was within the context of the story and not as \"annoyingly written characters\".For a youth book I'd be very careful as some of the \"villains\" here are genuinely frightening and could be a bit much for younger children, but were my children still young I'd read these to them. I developed a love for books early on and this book plays to that...I mentioned elsewhere that I loved Lilith by George MacDonald, I believe that it was the library scene in that book that first sold me or drew me into that book. This is a book full of book lovers for book lovers. Most any reader knows that a book can be a door to another world, here Funke took the idea and \"built on it\" with a certain amount of...literalness.
