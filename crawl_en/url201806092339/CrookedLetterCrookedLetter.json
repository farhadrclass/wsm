Gorgeous and dripping with emotion and ache...This story OWNED ME from the opening page and LARRY OTT is among the most endearing, heart-wrenching characters I've come across in a long, long time. That I connected so well with both the story and its main character surprised me because, being born and raised in Vegas, my own life experience is so vastly different from both Larry and the town of Chabot, Mississippi, where the story takes place. I give heaping mounds of credit to author Tom Franklin for making this \u201calien\u201d world come alive for me. Larry Ott is a 41 year old caucasian man living alone in his parents house in Chabot, MS, where he eats mostly McDonald\u2019s and KFC (by himself), owns an auto repair shop (with no local customers) and loves, loves, loves to read, especially Horror novels, of which Stephen King is his favorite. The reason for the above two parentheticals is that Larry is the town pariah. 25 years ago, when Larry was 16, a high school girl named Cindy Walker disappeared while on a date with Larry. While Larry was never arrested or formally accused of a crime, his reputation as the weird, horror book reading loner was enough to earn him a guilty verdict and a permanent shunning from the town. Larry feels this isolation down in his bones and Franklin casual, matter of fact description of it sliced right through me. Now Larry spends his days working in a shop with no customers, living alone with his chickens and having no visitors except for (i) drunk teenagers throwing bottles at his house and (ii) the County Investigator, Roy French, harassing him whenever a crime occurs. Beyonf that, Larry just sort of floats through the days, even treating his house as if he were only a guest. \nHe acted more like a curator, keeping the rooms clean, answering the mail and paying bills, turning on the television at the right times and smiling with the laugh tracks, eating his McDonald\u2019s or Kentucky Fried Chicken to what the networks presented him and then sitting on his front porch as the day bled out of the trees across the field and night settled in, each different, each teh same.\n That's Larry\u2019s life. Silas \u201c32\u201d Jones, is the African American Constable of Chabot, MS and the sole law enforcement officer in the area. Silas was a high school baseball star with dreams of going pro until injury cut his prospects short. For a brief time in high school, Silas and Larry were friends. However, since the disappearance of Cindy Walker, Silas has avoided all contact with \u201cScary Larry\u201d Ott. Silas is another damaged man with lots of baggage of his own. Silas often regrets the way he and the town treat Larry, but has become trapped in his own circumstances and is too weak to change. Viewed as a local hero, his days, while better than Larry\u2019s, are spent writing tickets, directing traffic and acting as a glorified meter maid. The town of Chabot is another amazing character in this story and Franklin\u2019s charming, understated prose is perfect. I listened to the audiobook and by the time you hear his words they've already vaporized and settled onto your brain like a flower-scented mist of small time life. His descriptions of Chabot and its slow, small town death are magical and precisely what they should be. \nHe passed a clothing store that had gone so long without customers it\u2019d briefly become a vintage clothing store without changing stock.\nThere's also a whole supporting cast of interesting, well drawn southern folks who come across as varying shades of good and bad. In other words, normal people and Franklin's unobtrusive prose has you able to visualize each one after spending only a few minutes with them. In fact, the atmosphere of the book, the feel of the characters and the pace and tone of the narrative reminded me a lot of To Kill a Mockingbird, which is high praise indeed as it is one of my all time favorites. However, where Atticus Finch made you wish you were his son, Larry Ott will break your heart and make you long to be his friend. For all that, this is NOT a depressingly morose sob-story, though I did tear up more than once. This lack of melodrama is the true gift of Franklin's novel. I don\u2019t know how he did it, but despite the often crushing sadness that follows Larry around and how sorry you feel for him from deep in your soul, Larry never wallows in his trials and the story never becomes overtly sentimental. It is a joy to follow Larry going through his day and you just keep hoping things get better for him. As far as the main thrust of the narrative:When another girl disappears, all fingers point towards \"Scary Larry\" and Silas is put in charge of the investigation. Through a series of lengthy flashbacks we are taken back through the childhoods of both main characters, their eventful meeting and brief friendship and the tragic events surrounding the previous disappearance that forever changed their lives. At its heart, this is the story of Larry and Silas and how circumstances, personal dreams and other peoples' perceptions can create barriers that are difficult to overcome. It's a story of good and evil, persecution and redemption, friendship and betrayal, secrets and truths. It's a story of life and one of those rare books that make you feel the world around you. I know I am gushing so I will just end by saying...6.0 stars. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!P.S. If you have the opportunity to listen to the audio version of this read by Kevin Kenerly, take it. His narration was masterful and fits the narrative like a glove."}, {"userName": "Jeffrey Keeten", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3427339-jeffrey-keeten", "userReview": "M, I, crooked letter, crooked letter, I, crooked letter, crooked letter, I, humpback, humpback, I.--How southern children are taught to spell Mississippi\nTom FranklinMy wife's family is from Prentiss, Mississippi not far from where the action of this book takes place. When my wife's grandmother died a few years ago we went down for the funeral. This was my first time in Mississippi and I remember a couple of things about the experience. First, this is small town USA and there were two funeral homes. One for black people and one for white people. When you ain't from around there you might accidently go to the wrong one.After the funeral we ended up back at grandmother's for a meal. The women stayed out in the kitchen except for when they were bringing more food around or filling up my ice tea. I swear my ice tea never got more than inch down from the rim. The men asked me questions. One thing they were really concerned about was how the South was perceived by a Yankee such as myself. I trotted out my bona fide that my gg grandfather Keeten was a Confederate soldier from Virginia. To people in Mississippi Virginia is Northern, so that bought me barely a dollop of legitimacy. My wife had warned me not to be outspoken politically. These weren't blue dog Democrats, but deep red Mississippi mud Republicans, and so I skated over the issues that I knew would cause a ruckus. They insisted to me how much Mississippi had changed, as if I were an ambassador from the North, and would go home and tell everyone that the South has become progressive. I agree, no doubt, the South had progressed in the last 150 years. The people were super. Everyone I met was sincere and every sentence was scented with Southern charm, but two different funeral homes tells me that the South still has some wrinkles that need smoothed out. I loved my time down there and can't wait to take a family vacation through Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia. I know, I know I'm supposed to be writing a book review not reminiscing. There is something about reading books set in the South that makes me want to tell stories. In junior high I was the kid that ordered too many books from Scholastic. I can still feel the shame reddening my neck and my cheeks as I walked up to the teacher's desk to get my book stack that was larger than the rest of the class put together. I was only someone's best friend when they needed help with their homework. So I did identify with the feelings of ostracization that Larry Ott was feeling in this novel. I was undersized too, one of the smallest guys in my class. I wore glasses and scurried around like a rabbit between classes. Small towns are tough and small schools are even tougher. There is no escape. In big schools you can blend in better, and also with a larger population you increase your chances in finding a \"freak\" like yourself. When people extol the virtues of their small school system I always think to myself they're great if your kid is designated normal. Larry Ott gets accused of a crime, a girl is missing. He is in the frame. People aren't accusing him just because he is weird. Circumstantial evidence does make him a legitimate suspect. The problem is when he is cleared of all charges the town does not forget. Another person, maybe a person that sat at the \"cool kids\" table could have moved on with their lives with only a passing reference to the unfortunate circumstances. Not Larry, not Scary Larry. Unfortunately for Larry the people of his small town America did not like him. He had been weighed and measured and found to be too weird. When another girl goes missing Larry is the number one suspect because what lingers in everyone's mind is the unfinished business from the first missing girl. Sympathy for his plight is not offered. He is, as he has been his whole life, alone. Silas \"32\" Jones is the closest Larry ever had to a friend. Their lives are entwined in a way that neither boy is fully aware of, yet there are phantom ghosts of information at the periphery of their consciousness that as more facts are revealed they don't question the results. They realize they've always known. When Larry lends Silas a rifle Silas becomes his friend for a short while. Silas likes the stories that Larry tells him from the pages of Stephen King, but refuses to even try to read a book. It is too much like school work. When Silas becomes a star short stop, known as 32 by everyone, Larry is just an embarrassment to him. Silas will look back with more than a little regret that he didn't lay a friendly hand on Larry's shoulder or ask him to join in social activities. He was uniquely positioned to change Larry's life forever. His gift of athleticism empowered him to bring Larry into the social group. His offer of friendship would have forced people to see Larry differently. By some quirk of fate I started growing. By the time I got to high school I had evolved from being one of the shortest people in my class to being the tallest person in my class. As it turned out I was coordinated enough to play sports and did well. Like Silas, when people would see me in the local diner or on the street or in the hallway they would call out my jersey number, 12. The people I needed so desperately when I was so lonely all of a sudden were my \"best friends\". It was simply ridiculous. I can score twenty points in a basketball game, and miraculously I am cured of being the number one class freak. Growing up I was Silas and Larry. I understand all too well their fallacies and their insecurities. I felt Larry's burning shame as if my own cheeks were inflamed. I felt Silas's guilt as if it were resting on my own shoulders. Franklin keyed into elements that I have given a lot of thought to. I can tell from reading other reviews that this book had a profound impact on people. It certainly made me plow over old ground. My one complaint is that I feel that Franklin could have put more meat on the bone. It does not have the complexity of a book that I could wholeheartedly agree is a modern classic. I really enjoyed another book by Franklin called Hell at the Breech.If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit http://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at:https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten"}, {"userName": "Rebbie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6582211-rebbie", "userReview": "Poor Larry Ott. He's a beautiful soul whose wings have been clipped; he's damaged and hurting after a lifetime of being ridiculed, being thrown to the wolves, being falsely accused of a horrific crime.And yet he doesn't lose his sweetness or optimism, even after his only childhood friend, Silas, ditches him out of fear of losing his own newfound popularity. Silas has to accept how poorly he used to treat Larry while they were growing up, and it's not easy to do. The author did a magnificent job of facing this raw pain head-on.All Larry ever wanted is one true friend, but life kicked him where the sun doesn't shine when it comes to that wish too. I just wanted to wrap him up in a blanket and hold him. Make it all better because someone as kindhearted and gentle as he is shouldn't have to face the cruelties of this world alone.People who are alone become a target, an easy mark for bullies and people who can wildly spin things out of control at the drop of a hat. The other people who come into Larry's life have their own twisted agenda, but Larry's loneliness makes it difficult to turn anyone away. This is crucial to the layout of the story.I almost gave this 4 stars because the ending is too neatly tied together, but the character development is true perfection, so it's worth the extra star."}, {"userName": "Arah-Lynda", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5859453-arah-lynda", "userReview": "So often when I read a book I cannot wait to talk about it, eager to hear other people's takes and share my own thoughts, but sometimes, as in life, the unexpected occurs. \u00a0A book has been read all right and it affected me but still I need to let it rest a while, need to think on it, recover from it.I found myself looking back, being brutally honest in my reflection. \u00a0Have I ever succumbed to group think and if so how often have I hurt others? \u00a0And even though in truth I have never really fit in with groups or cliques or the like, that experience in itself, makes me more prone somehow to the lure of community. \u00a0At what cost? \u00a0\u00a0I am not without blemishes. \u00a0I strive to be a better person today. \u00a0Each day.Group think is dangerous, it holds open no doors for freedom, fairness, equality or justice. \u00a0It just is. \u00a0I am humbled by Larry Ott. \u00a0He seeped in somehow. \u00a0He reminded me that others bore a cross heavier, less forgiving than my own. \u00a0\u00a0Of course I always knew that. \u00a0\u00a0Still \u00a0that knowledge had lurked for too long in the shadow of my own fear, and uncertainties. \u00a0Larry Ott can not be ignored and in not doing so, one must also consider Silas.

I was mesmerized by the rural Mississippi setting and quickly connected to the main characters. Larry Ott, otherwise known as Scary Larry by an unforgiving and judgmental community, and Silas Jones, the former high school baseball star, have a history. A history that goes back more than twenty years to that difficult and often merciless time of life \u2013 boyhood and adolescence. Larry was always a loner. The white kid shunned by everyone else because he was different. He liked to read, wasn\u2019t interested in sports, and just lacked the social skills necessary to be one of the popular kids. Sound familiar?! \"Used to be, his mouth always hung open, giving the impression he was slow. But he wasn\u2019t. He was smart. Knew the weirdest shit.\" Silas is black, new to town, and the son of a single, poverty-stricken mother. At one time, the two struck up a secret friendship, nurturing each other\u2019s desire for another human connection. As often with \u2018secret\u2019 friendships, they don\u2019t remain so for long. The two part ways, and when teenaged Larry is the main suspect in the disappearance of a local girl, Silas never looks back - until now, when another girl goes missing two decades later. Who better to incriminate than the town scapegoat? Silas is the town constable and Larry is eyed with suspicion once again. Silas is perhaps the sole keeper of some secrets that never came to light all those years ago. Will his conscience and his moral compass point him in the right direction?This book will cause you to reflect on the choices we make when it comes to the inclusion of others. Especially those that seem so fundamentally unlike ourselves. Do we have a role in molding another\u2019s future based on our narrow-mindedness or misguided notions of our fellow beings? Can we make an individual become the person we in fact believe them to be? How does one withstand the onslaught of animosity delivered repeatedly over a period of years\u2026 can it be overcome? Larry Ott is on my list of the most memorable characters in literature. My heart broke for the young Larry, and I am full of affection for the older Larry. Likely we can all catch glimpses of ourselves in either Larry or Silas. And that is not a bad thing. How do we help our own young Larrys or Silases? Schools talk about inclusion, advocate for it in fact, but I regret to say that we still have not achieved this goal. Exclusion seems even more rampant in this day and age of social media. Sigh\u2026 well, I don\u2019t want to go off on a further tangent here. We can only keep working in the right direction.Highly recommend this slow-burning mystery to anyone that enjoys superb character development and excellent writing.

Poor Larry Ott, the bookish kid, the weak one, a smallish white boy, the bully-target at school, takes out the girl of his dreams, returns home alone, and gets blamed for her presumed rape and murder. Decades later, ostracized by the town, living alone in the same house he grew up in, tending his late, abusive father\u2019s garage, another girl goes missing and all fingers point his way. Did he or didn\u2019t he? But Crooked Letter, Crooked Letter tells of two twisted lives. As a kid, Silas came to town when his mother, Alice, had to flee a bad situation in Chicago. He and Larry became friends. But after high school, black baseball-star Silas left for college, then stayed away until decades later when he returns, joining the local police department. Why? The book takes us back and forth between the present day, the investigation into the latest disappearance, and the story of Silas and Larry\u2019s ill-fated friendship.Crooked Letter, Crooked Letter is a tale of black and white told in shades of gray. Franklin's main characters display human strengths and weaknesses. He shows the racial environment and tension in 1970s Mississippi, reduced, but still far from dissipated today. We see that people act on what they believe rather than on what they know. Where does purity lie? Truth? Atonement? Forgiveness? Although Crooked Letter, Crooked Letter offers a piercing account of life in rural Mississippi it holds resonance beyond the time and place. The sort of people who find Larry peculiar because he reads are the same ones who deny evolution, global warming or the holocaust. The atmosphere of the place is very nicely drawn as history seeps from the past into the present in forms physical as well as psychic. Too much looks the same as it did way back when, only more eroded. Franklin drew a lot on his own childhood. Like Larry, his father was a mechanic; he lived on the outskirts of a small southern town; he was a bookish kid in a place where that was not a good thing to be; he was a loner. And while he was not so ostracized in real life as his stand-in is in his novel, he knows of what he speaks. Tom Franklin has written a very moving tale about being an outsider. You will feel for Larry. Crooked Letter Crooked Letter has received a flood of critical approval. And there is a lot to like here, engaging characters, a good depiction of place and time, powerful imagery in the form of serpents and masks. It seems like a sure thing. And I did enjoy the book. But the straight dope is that it did not do for me what it seems to have done for some other readers. Franklin is clearly a very good writer, but is hardly the second coming of Faulkner.

Long before remaking \u201970s slasher films with as much blood as possible was considered mainstream entertainment, liking Stephen King novels or other horror books and movies might get your folks a closed door session with your teacher. Before Lord of the Rings made a gazillion dollars and won Oscars, you probably would have gotten blank stares or called a nerd if you tried talking about hobbits and orcs to most people. Larry Ott is a geek who was born just a bit too soon, and that\u2019s why he completely broke my heart in this excellent book.In a small Mississippi town, we meet Larry and Silas \u201c32\u201d Jones. Larry is a 41 year old white bachelor who lives in his parents\u2019 house that he has preserved just like it was when they lived there, and he goes to work every day at the garage his father ran despite the fact he never has any customers. Larry lives with almost no interactions with other people and spends most of his time reading or visiting his mother in the rest home. When Larry was 16, he was a geek who read horror novels all the time and was considered a weirdo by everyone in his school. Larry finally scored a date with a hot girl, but unfortunately she was never seen again after he picked her up. He was never charged or convicted of a crime, but the entire community decided he killed her and he\u2019s been an outcast ever since.Silas is black and the local constable of a small town that is completely owned by a lumber mill. He was a baseball star in high school before tearing up his arm in college. For a brief time before Larry went on his ill-fated date, he and Larry were friends, but Silas now does everything he can to avoid contact with him. Now that a local college girl has gone missing, Larry is a prime suspect, and the events that happen will force both men to face their pasts.I can\u2019t say enough good things about this book. The depiction of life in a modern small town being choked out by large corporations was excellent as were the many supporting characters. It uses extensive flashbacks to set up our present day story and then fill in the blanks with the history. Even with the great setting and clever story telling, it\u2019s the characters of Silas and Larry that really make this thing hum.Silas is a former local hero who has returned back to the site of his previous glory, but even though most people still call him \u201832\u2019 after his old baseball number, he spends his days directing traffic, writing tickets and riding around in a decrepit old jeep because the town can\u2019t afford anything better. But Larry has it even worse. Over two decades as a local boogeyman have left him isolated and stuck in a past that wasn\u2019t that good to begin with. He\u2019s the kind of guy who feels bad for the chickens in his coop for having to spend every day on the same patch of mud so he rigs up a mobile trailer and rotates them around different parts of his field so they can spend time in fresh grass. He lives in his quiet routine without complaint even after 25 years of being harassed by the police, barred from local businesses and churches, and being the target of frequent drunken teenage pranks. The saddest thing is that he doesn\u2019t even seem to realize how achingly lonely he is.

It was Stephen's that made me rush to the library after work and grab a copy. After reading Shine and Winter's Bone, I was hesitant about reading another depressing story set in the south, but I\u2019m so glad I did. Larry Ott had a tough childhood growing up in rural Mississippi. He was sickly and he had a stutter. He never quite fit in among his classmates, usually the butt of a joke or the target of a bully. His dad was cold, distant and unaffectionate. Reading books was his only escape, until he met Silas Jones. The two boys were friends for a short time, enjoying activities like shooting, playing in the woods, and hanging out. Larry\u2019s life was forever changed when popular Cindy Walker asked him on a date. Though no evidence was found linking Larry to her mysterious disappearance, he has been the object of scorn and speculation, resulting in his isolation from the close-knit, rural community he grew up in. Silas, meanwhile, has moved on. Now 41, Larry\u2019s days are spent repairing the cars of the few out-of-towners who visit his late father\u2019s garage, tending his chickens, and reading his favorite Stephen King novels. Silas returns to Mississippi as a town constable. He and Larry\u2019s lives intersect again when another girl disappears. This beautiful, sad and unforgettable story weaves back and forth, between the past and the present, revealing details about childhood and the awkward teenage years.

After you hit the top, you're in for a ride. \nFirst came this mean little collection of a novella and nine short stories.\nThen came a dark novel bringing the Alabama Clarke County range war to life.\nAnd when I thought Franklin had gotten the mud, the blood and the beer out of his system, he turns Rumpelstiltskin upside down with a malicious little dwarf named Smonk.\n I've been a Tom Franklin fan since the publication of his first book, \"Poachers.\" The novella title piece in that anthology won an Edgar Award. He is a master of Southern Gothic. His prose is lean, mean, yet frequently is laced with a lyricism that borders on poetry. Franklin can write violence of so fierce a nature that his mild looks make you wonder where he finds the source of the ferocity in his stories.Franklin is one of the most amiable authors I've met. Soft spoken, with an easy smile, you look at him and wonder how the Hell he comes up with stuff that makes you shudder. So having said that, Crooked Letter, Crooked Letter seems to have been produced by a different writer. This is a kinder, gentler Franklin, though the occurrence of violence is present in his latest, it is not what you might have come to expect from him.The violent acts in Franklin's latest are not what you would see in a Sam Peckinpah film, it is more reminiscent of the murders committed in Fritz Lang's classic film \"M.\" Franklin should find a wider audience with \"Crooked Letter\" by leaving some of the horror to the reader's imagination.Franklin tells a story of two boys, one black and one white, who grow up together only to show up on opposite sides of a murder case. Larry Ott was suspected of murdering a girl who disappeared when he was fifteen. After all, it was Larry who took her on a date to the drive-in. She never made it home. As we say these days, Larry was a person of interest. But no body was ever found. No corpus delicti, no case. But through the years when anything untoward has gone on, Larry has built up a collection of search warrants. \"You understand,\" the Sheriff tells him. Ever the compliant one, Larry nods while the Sheriff goes about his business. Now another young girl has gone missing and Ott is the usual suspect. As a child, Silas Jones lived in a hunting cabin owned by Larry's father. Now Silas is the Constable in town and will become involved in the investigation of the latest disappearance.While Larry has always been the goat, Silas has always been the hero. No two guys ever turned a double play the way \"32\" Jones and M&M could. Jones went on up to Ole Miss playing ball. M&M became your friendly dope dealer.After an injury ends Silas' sports career he comes home to his job as Constable. Everybody still loves \"32\" Jones. Somebody doesn't love M&M and killed him. Silas finds his body beneath a swirl of vultures. Then there's that rattlesnake someone put in a young woman's mailbox. Silas has more business than a man with a badge wants. Then, damn it, somebody's gone and shot Larry Ott. The Sheriff thinks Larry did it out of remorse for the crimes he has committed. His guilt must have finally got to him. Larry is hovering between life and death in the hospital. Silas processes the crime scene; but then begins picking up Larry's mail and feeding the chickens. He's waiting for Larry to wake up. He has something to tell him.What strange bond holds Larry and Silas together, yet keeps them apart? The secret lies somewhere in the past. Franklin deftly weaves their story with chapters alternating between the present and the past.This is an extremely satisfying work of contemporary southern literature. Read it. Then give yourself a little time and read it again. It is even stronger the second time around."}, {"userName": "Jason", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4426615-jason", "userReview": "I want to be clear on the 3-star rating, folks. I liked this book. I swear. I just don\u2019t believe it lived up to the potential I arbitrarily ascribed to it when I saw on the shelf of my local Stop & Shop\u2019s aisle 7.Guys, I can\u2019t review books anymore.

But I still maintain it\u2019s because of reviewer burnout, not the drink.So I\u2019ll say it again. I did like this book. Larry is a reclusive white boy in 1970s Mississippi who is in the wrong place at the wrong time and spends the remainder of his adult life the subject of neighborhood gossip and small-town ridicule as a result of that poor timing. Silas is (or was) his best and only friend. Silas, a black boy, is in most ways better off than Larry, even while being a black boy in 1970s Mississippi and fatherless, as Silas was athletic and sociable and had friends and had respect and had a girlfriend and had a life outside his dreary home existence.Generally speaking, the characters are not poorly drawn but sometimes it becomes glaringly obvious when someone (in this case Larry) becomes the author\u2019s pet, and that pet status penetrates the character to the extent that he begins to resemble a two-dimensional stock: Larry is pitifully harmless, incapable of having a mean streak that would have otherwise given him a more rounded out character (and possibly made his involvement in the crime-in-question more ambiguous), and essentially can do no wrong. I realize this is sort of crappy of me, but I kept comparing this book to \nWinter's Bone\n and for me, it just doesn\u2019t live up to that level of literary brilliance. Perhaps I expect too much from crime fiction these days, but I like to think that speaks more to how good crime fiction has gotten rather than to my being a demanding jerk about it.To reiterate, though: I really did like this book.

Now Silas is back in town this time in the capacity of constable, returning to a moral dilemma. There's another murder and Larry's the prime suspect, how can he live with himself if he turns his back on his friend again.For me the idea of small town life both attracts and repels. If you fit in there\u2019d be nothing warmer or more embracing - if you didn\u2019t it could be a living hell. From day one Larry doesn\u2019t fit. As a boy he has nose bleeds, stutters, reads too many damn books. While not found guilty by a jury he might as well have been, the town sentences him to a life of friendless isolation.

And not a drop of meanness either, like how he cares for his chickens, rigging up that moveable pen so they get a change of scenery, some fresh air, a few bugs to eat. My heart went out to him, this guy who\u2019s never experienced kindness treating a bunch of birds, chickens no less, with more compassion than he\u2019s ever been shown.While both Silas & Larry's characters are richly defined, it\u2019s Larry I\u2019ll remember - the world\u2019s loneliest mechanic.

Per Duvall, all\u2019epoca trentenne, era il primo film.Larry, il ragazzo bianco \u00e8 timido, introverso, lega poco e male con i suoi coetanei, \u00e8 oggetto di bullismo, perfino da parte dei ragazzi di colore (la segregazione sembra superata\u2026). Ama leggere libri horror, fatica a trovare il suo posto a scuola come a casa. Nonostante sia il bianco, vive il disagio tipico di chi si sente inferiore e parte di una minoranza. \u00c8 il Boo Radley del paese, e in qualche modo \u00e8 anche considerato il Norman Bates del posto.Silas, il ragazzo nero, per quanto di condizione economica nettamente inferiore, \u00e8 pi\u00f9 audace, sia nei confronti della vita, che della gente in genere e delle ragazze in particolare: ama lo sport, l\u2019avventura, parte, viaggia, ritorna, si costruisce una carriera, \u00e8 amato e rispettato, \u00e8 quello bello. Il ragazzo nero sembra quello bianco, e viceversa.In fondo, a Chabot (cinquecento anime: un borgo prima ancora che un paese) con un futuro alle spalle, e dove il passato non passa mai, a Chabot la strada pi\u00f9 malfamata si chiama White Trash Avenue, perch\u00e9 i relitti umani, i junkies, sono bianchi: i primi sono diventati ultimi senza che gli ultimi prendessero quel posto da loro perduto.Anthony Perkins-Norman Bates, interpretazione che gli valse la carriera, non riusc\u00ec mai a scucirsela di dosso. In \u201cPsycho\u201d, 1959, Norman \u00e8 un bravo tassidermista. \u201cPsycho\u201d di Alfred Hitchcock \u00e8 l\u2019adattamento del romanzo omonimo di Robert Bloch, che ne scrisse poi altri due con lo stesso personaggio, creando una saga.I personaggi sono pi\u00f9 importanti della trama: chi sono, da dove vengono, e dove vanno, cosa li lega, li avvicina e li allontana, conta pi\u00f9 dei fatti, singoli o nel complesso. Viene da pensare che Franklin abbia preso le mosse proprio dai personaggi e poi abbia costruito l\u2019architettura della trama: che regge, ma i personaggi che la determinano funzionano meglio. Franklin sa maneggiare il genere senza restarne imbrigliato: per\u00f2 la trama ha qualche forzatura di troppo, qualche agnizione un po\u2019 appiccicata, e tirata. Quello che gli riesce meglio \u00e8 costruire la personalit\u00e0 dei suoi personaggi, renderli credibili.E poi, perfino meglio, gli riesce descrivere la natura, animale e vegetale, altro protagonista, qui come nei suoi racconti: l\u2019Alabama, il sud rurale degli Stati Uniti, \u00e8 vivamente presente in queste pagine, spicca, conta, brilla, incide nelle vite della gente, determina. Magnifica ed efficace metafora di questa terra \u00e8 il kudzu, un rampicante che cresce a un ritmo forsennato, e copre tutto, alberi, case, rovine e vecchie auto: strangola dolcemente tutto quello a cui si avvinghia, un abbraccio avvolgente e letale. Un\u2019immagine che sa di degrado e di dolcezza allo stesso tempo, di morte e di bellezza. Spettacolare.Il kudzu, pueraria lobata, pianta rampicante appartenente alla famiglia delle leguminose le cui foglie e radici sono ricche di principi attivi benefici per la salute. Utilizzata da pi\u00f9 di 1.300 anni nella cucina asiatica, questa pianta \u00e8 diffusa in tutto l'Estremo Oriente e oggi le sue propriet\u00e0 vengono sfruttate anche nel mondo occidentale, dove rappresenta un aiuto soprattutto per chi vuole smettere di fumare. Pu\u00f2 infatti capitare di trovare il Kudzu fra gli ingredienti dei liquidi utilizzati nelle sigarette elettroniche. Altro principio attivo del kudzu \u00e8 visibile nella foto e ben raccontato nel romanzo.Per Tom Franklin i paragoni tirati in ballo sono sempre con gli scrittori di quella parte geografica degli Stati Uniti (Faulkner, Williams, O\u2019Connor, Caldwell\u2026). A me \u00e8 per\u00f2 soprattutto venuta in mente una scrittrice che invece non appartiene alla compagine sudista, Joyce Carol Oates.Altro scrittore sempre tirato in ballo quando si parla di Franklin \u00e8 Carver, che secondo me \u00e8 percepibile in queste pagine soprattutto in quanto si tratta di storie di fallimenti, storie di looser. Come tanta letteratura nordamericana anche qui si parla di redenzione, si parla del senso di colpa, della caduta e della possibilit\u00e0 di riscatto: per diventare adulti occorre soffrire.-Eravamo amici.

This book ... (flails helplessly) ... it is a gut puncher, heart-wrencher. Franklin is a poet, his prose sings, his characters walk off the page, and he puts the reader into a time and place that absolutely resonates with a vibrancy and brutal honesty all its own. I was so sad -- so emotionally invested -- that I found the reading painful to bear at times. Franklin's descriptions of human isolation and loneliness are so raw and uncompromising I forced myself to take breathers between reading sessions. I don't think this is a book meant to be read in one gulp; it is made up of so much complexity and depth that it's better to sip from its well, savor what you've tasted, and then go back for more. The water can be frigid cold, and if you drink too much too fast you're bound to get excruciating brain freeze. This book had me at hello: it's set in the American south, it features the mess of family dynamics, and secrets big and small stalk its pages. It is a coming-of-age story and at its center are two boys -- Silas and Larry. Their lives intersect in ways neither could have predicted, and one of them must carry the pain and punishment of that connection his entire life. It is a heavy burden, but I will say not without redemption. I love Larry Ott -- not only is he a die-hard Stephen King fan, despite years of being ruthlessly cast as town pariah, Larry quietly goes on about his business. He is not consumed by bitterness, or enraged by the unfairness of the abuse that has been heaped upon him. That takes a strong man, and this is what probably made me the most sad is that Larry doesn't know how great and kind a man he really is. Beaten down first by his father, then by the town, he is prevented from discovering his true qualities of inner strength and dignity. Read this book. It is beautiful. So very sad, but beautiful.And because they are so good, and do the novel such justice, I will refer you to the reviews of Stephen and Kemper.First line fever: The Rutherford Girl had been missing for eight days when Larry Ott returned home and found a monster waiting in his house."}, {"userName": "\u262eKaren", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1076079-karen", "userReview": "M, i, crooked letter, crooked letter, i, crooked letter, crooked letter, i, humpback, humpback, i.

Larry Ott, suspected in a girl's disappearance in his teenage years but never charged, grows up lonely and ostracized in their little town.

The story is told in scenes that alternate between the 1970s and the present day. At the heart of the story are two men, one white, the other black, who for a brief period of time as boys were secretly close friends in a time and place where their friendship, if public, would have only brought them trouble.The white man is Larry Ott, the only child of a lower class family. His father was a mechanic who seemed to have little patience for or interest in his son. Even as a boy, Larry was quiet and withdrawn. With no athletic or social skills, he had no friends at all, was ridiculed at school, and gradually withdrew into a world of books. In high school he had only one date, which ended tragically when the girl he had taken out disappeared and was never seen again.The entire county believes that Larry raped and killed the girl and then buried her body. Since the body was never recovered and since there was no physical evidence to connect Larry to her disappearance, he was never prosecuted. But now derided as \"Scary Larry,\" he is even more ostracized and his family disintegrates in the wake of the tragedy.Twenty-five years later, Larry is still living in the family home, alone now, tending to the chickens and still reading his books. Every day, he drives into the garage he inherited from his father and waits in vain for any customer to appear, but no one in the small community will have anything to do with him. Then another young woman disappears and all eyes turn to Larry as the obvious suspect.Larry's black boyhood friend was Silas Jones, a gifted athlete known as \"32,\" the number he wore on his baseball uniform. Silas was raised as the only son of a black single mother and never knew who his father might have been. For a brief time, Silas and his mother lived in an abandoned shack on property owned by Larry's father, which is how the two boys briefly became friends.Shortly after the first young woman went missing, Silas left the area to go to college and pursue his dream of a career in baseball. Now he's back, serving as the town constable, and he sees no reason to make an effort to renew his friendship with Larry Ott. But the disappearance of the second woman will throw the two men together again, whether they like it or not. The crimes at the heart of the story serve principally as a backdrop for the larger story of the relationship between Larry and \"32,\" and watching that story unfold is a very rich and rewarding reading experience--one of my favorite books of the year thus far."}, {"userName": "Margitte", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte", "userReview": "Two boyhood friends, now 'non-friends' in adulthood, are forced to face their individual bags of bones in their closets, when a serious crime strikes their small town in Mississippi. Thrown together, the skeletons screamed their stories to a world who refused to acknowledge their truth. Instead, the people around them preferred to believe their own versions and acted upon it all these years.For Silas Jones, or '32', as he was known as a high school baseball hero, it could have been different if he only had the guts to do the right thing. But how could he, if social norms dictated devastating consequences for both him and his mother if he followed the terms of human kindness, integrity and honor. Those rules applied to everyone else. He had no right to it. The only symbols he could safely allow to define him was his status as the sole law enforcement agent of Chabot, population 500; driver of an ancient '76 four cylinder Jeep with its clip-on flashing light, it's emphysemic air conditioner, its leaky master cylinder, its audiometer stuck on 144,007 miles, and addict to both Freon and brake fluid. Silas was also a registrant for three firearms and a Taser; and a badge he usually wore on a lanyard around his neck. Larry Ott had only an umbrella on the gun rack in his 1970s Ford pickup; nurtured the egg -laying First Ladies in his chicken pen; had more books stacked all over his remote home than the town library, owned a two-bay shop on Highway 11 North, and could not call anyone a friend under any circumstances. Larry was a mechanic, but only in theory. His Ford had only 56,000 miles on its original six-cylinder, with the rest of it being immaculate factory part replacements.What they did not force upon themselves, the town did for them, through discrimination, prejudice, ruthless gossip and justified moral corruption. However, what the town refused to fuse, destiny would, when the teenage daughter, Tina Rutherford, of the wealthy Rutherford Lumber Company's mill owner, disappears one night. The collective memory of the town recalled another unresolved disappearance twenty years earlier of Cindy Walker ...When M&M, the drug dealer in town is found dead, a new chapter begins in a town where change is forced upon them like the necessity to rebuild a carburetor. All they had to do was fix what was broken for all of them and find the culprit who left snakes in women's letter boxes ...COMMENTSOh dear, of course I LOVED my first experience of the author Tom Franklin's books. A soul-wrenching read of a richly textured, compassionate tale, with a positive ending. The ending determined the rating in this case, since I needed something good to restore emotional equilibrium after tough previous reads.

But then a saw screams in and the tree topples and the circles are stricken by the sun and the sap glistens and the stump is laid open for the world to see.\nImagine painfully bearing other people's lies and secrets, yet being unaware you're doing so.Sure, the story takes place through interesting dialogue, a heartrending plot, and neatly developed characters, but to truly know Larry and Silas is to be engrossed within a nuanced tale of two Southern men who are very different, and yet quite similar, men shackled by similar heritage, shackled by more than they'd imagined. Imagine time distorted and bruised, time forgiven and healed."}, {"userName": "Bill", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/810550-bill", "userReview": "I didn't sleep well last night.It was one of the very rare occurrences where I finish a book in bed without another one to pick up right away. You see, I hate being between books. When I finish one, I immediately choose another and begin it right away. But last night was an anomaly. Just the way things worked out.So. Turning out the light immediately after finishing this left methinking about the whole thing for much of the night. I kept going over what it was that Franklin did that made me care for these characters so much. He has an understated style of writing, but what was there really resonated.Larry Ott. Oh man. How I felt for this guy. A boy after my own heart, lonely but finding refuge in Stephen King's novels. In adulthood, a man who is ostracized by an entire town amid suspicions that he killed a girl 25 years ago.Now, another girl is missing, and \"Scary Larry\" is, of course, suspected.Did he or didn't he?The story moves along in present day, and also flashing back to the past (a formula I never tire of), and explores life in small town Mississippi, and Larry's friendship with a Silas (a dirt-poor black boy). I was totally immersed. Part of the reason I didn't have another book ready to read after this one is because this is the only book that mattered while I was reading it.I've noticed some reviewers have made comparisons to To Kill a Mockingbird, which is inevitable given the Mississippi setting and race relations. A pretty high standard there, but I feel it's warranted. I wish I had the eloquence to describe how Franklin touched on life in Mississippi and how human kindness struggles to rise to the surface, and does it, really? Gosh, I loved being into this story and I'm so sorry it's over. I'm still thinking about it and I'm having a tough time selecting the next book to read.Any book that keeps buzzing in my head like this did deserves the highest rating."}, {"userName": "Madeline", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/111921-madeline", "userReview": "Something I learned about myself while reading this book: I am incapable of reading books that include a murder mystery but don't focus on the mystery aspect.Look guys, I love detective novels. I love seeing how an author puts together a crime, presents the circumstances, and shows us the investigation process while disguising the real solution until the moment they're ready to give us the answer. It's fun to read about mysteries, so when I get a book that features a mystery but tries to distract me with Big Issues, I just get frustrated. I do not care about your racial tolerance message, there has been a murder.Crooked Letter, Crooked Letter is a good book - I want to establish that right off the bat. Its chapters alternate between the perspectives of two men, Larry Ott (a white man) and Silas Jones (a black man) in a small town in Mississippi. The two men were friends growing up in the 70's, but as adults they haven't spoken in years. When they were in high school, a girl disappeared, and the last person to see her was Larry. He was never arrested or accused of having something to do with the disappearance, but the suspicion has followed him his entire life, making him a pariah in his town. Years later, Silas is now a police officer, and another girl has disappeared. Everyone suspects Larry, and he and Silas are forced to confront their past together.So obviously, the point of the story is not the disappearance; the point is the strained and complex relationship between these two men. It's a good story, but I was distracted the entire time because I was too busy trying to figure out who killed the two women who disappeared (the solution, I should add, will be plainly obvious to anyone who has seen even one episode of Law and Order: SVU). I had the same issue with Donna Tartt's The Little Friend: the mystery wasn't the point of the book, but I hated the story because she didn't provide a satisfying solution to the mystery that the plot revolved around (Franklin, at least, ties up his mystery's loose ends, so I didn't have to throw the book against the wall). I can't help it, guys - I'm incapable of turning off my detective-novel brain, and it meant that I didn't enjoy this book as much as I should have."}, {"userName": "Annet", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1166369-annet", "userReview": "Read this book in 2012, remember it's a great, have to re-read soon!"}, {"userName": "Greg", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42508-greg", "userReview": "I'm fairly certain that my reaction to books is dependent on things going on outside of the text itself. Certain books read at certain times of my life affected me in ways that I can't imagine they would affect me now. Other times the shit that is going on in my life makes me unable to give a book that I might otherwise really enjoy the kind of attention, or mood, or something that it really deserves. Is this one of those books?Maybe. I see gushing reviews for this. And I went into expecting to love the book. I was looking forward to it, really I was. Maybe I was expecting too much? Maybe. Or maybe it wasn't the type of book that I would really enjoy while sitting in a Chicago Airport for an extra hour and a half because of delays, and continuing reading while sitting on the tarmac waiting to take off because of even more delays, a couple of them bordering on absurdly comical and finally finishing somewhere just past Toledo at thirty something thousand feet while the plane banged around from turbulence. Maybe all of those things and the annoyance in my head that I'd be getting back to New York close to midnight and that it would be a pain in the ass to get home at that hour using public transportation was putting me in the kind of mood where just about any book was going to lose its luster. Maybe that is what my three star rating is all about. If so, I'm sorry Mr. Franklin. If it means anything this is a really high three stars. The book sort of reminded me of some of George Pelecanos' later novels, like The Way Home (and another one that I read but apparently never rated, stupid Greg), and that is a good comparison (actually, maybe the comparison sucks and you might not think these are alike at all, but I mean it's a good comparison in my head because I thought quite highly of The Way Home). I really liked the character of Larry Ott, he was so pitiful and beaten down that I wanted to think he was totally unbelievable, but the more I thought about him and his station in life I started to realize how perfectly created he was and how he couldn't be any other way. I didn't care so much for the character of Silas 'thirty two' Jones, I didn't like that he gave his name as thirty two, I thought that was kind of absurd but not in a good way (although I guess it is believable), but more I just didn't think his character was as developed, and in another novel he might have been fine but being paired off with the amazingly developed character of Ott he seemed too formulaic. I think the novel could have used more of something. I'm not sure exactly more of what, but I think the characters of the town could have really come to life in the way that Donald Harington's do, I'd be interested to see Franklin use some of his minor characters in other works, but I don't think he's the type of writer to do this kind of thing (I have no basis for saying this, he might be, I've only read this one book by him and here I am blabbing like I'm some kind of expert, fuck you Stahl, why don't you just write your fucking book report already). One other thing I didn't like too much about the book was the ending. I didn't mind the way the main story of the book wrapped up, but then there were still four or five chapters left, which was used to wrap up some of the underlying conflicts in the novel. Maybe it was the delays and annoyances of traveling (I don't care for flying much, it's almost always unpleasant for me, with either the morbidly obese sitting next to me (three times now, three! and I rarely fly) or else my head is so fucked up by the pressure changes that I'm deaf and feel like someone is sticking ice picks in both of my ears for most of the flight), but once the main story wrapped up I started to get impatient for the book to end. There was some good stuff in the 'wrap' up part of the book, but there were also a couple of moments that I had a hard time accepting that the characters would act the way they did, and frankly (I almost wrote frankly Franklin, but then thought better of it, but see I didn't really write it because it's not in the main thread of the review) I kind of would have liked not knowing how the characters turned out after all of the main conflict had resolved. Probably, though, I'd be bitching and moaning about loose strings of the plot if the book didn't have these last few chapters. I wish I had loved the book like Karen does. If you haven't done so yet, you should read her review of the book, and see the picture she has of her and Tom Franklin at a book signing, and be more influenced by her great review than my whining rant about the woes of being a privileged fuck who was delayed a couple of hours in a couple of thousand mile trip that he was still able to make in a mere ten hours."}, {"userName": "Natalie Richards", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11247707-natalie-richards", "userReview": "I loved this book.

Now the Edgar Award-winning author returns with his most accomplished and resonant novel so far\u0097an atmospheric drama set in rural Mississippi. In the late 1970s, Larry Ott and Silas \"32\" Jones were boyhood pals. Their worlds were as different as night and day: Larry, the child of lower-middle-class white parents, and Silas, the son of a poor, single black mother. Yet for a few months the boys stepped outside of their circumstances and shared a special bond. But then tragedy struck: Larry took a girl on a date to a drive-in movie, and she was never heard from again. She was never found and Larry never confessed, but all eyes rested on him as the culprit. The incident shook the county\u0097and perhaps Silas most of all. His friendship with Larry was broken, and then Silas left town. More than twenty years have passed. Larry, a mechanic, lives a solitary existence, never able to rise above the whispers of suspicion. Silas has returned as a constable. He and Larry have no reason to cross paths until another girl disappears and Larry is blamed again. And now the two men who once called each other friend are forced to confront the past they've buried and ignored for decades.", "title": "Crooked Letter, Crooked Letter", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9436201-crooked-letter-crooked-letter", "average": 3.83, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328069022l/9436201.jpg", "reviews": 4493, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/125736.Tom_Franklin", "name": "Tom Franklin"}], "type": ["Mystery", "Fiction", "Mystery", "American", "Gothic"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9436201-crooked-letter-crooked-letter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7948230-crooked-letter-crooked-letter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16301400-l-avvoltoio", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9429500-crooked-letter-crooked-letter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9674087-crooked-letter-crooked-letter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9819204-crooked-letter-crooked-letter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17349083-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/214340.Hell_at_the_Breech", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/367625.Poachers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/385530.Smonk", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27131485-mississippi-noir"]}
