The story was engaging, the characters likeable, and the romance was amazing. I loved the contemporary marriage of convenience storyline; it was unique to have it in a contemporary setting and I think the way it was done was great.After being introduced to both Brady and Hope in Blue Ridge Sunrise, I was eager to read their story and see how everything played out. Brady just lost his ex-wife and Hope has her own heartache. The reasons for their to decision to get married were realistic and I liked how they were up-front about their expectations and that they would \"court\" with the intentions of it leading to a \"true marriage\" in the future.All in all, Honeysuckle Dreams was a wonderful contemporary read. After being disappointed in the first book, Blue Ridge Sunrise, I am so happy that this book was typical Denise Hunter fiction and I recommend it to fans of contemporary romance! I cannot wait to read the next book, On Magnolia Lane.*Disclosure of Material Connection: I received one or more of the products or services mentioned above for free in the hope that I would mention/review it on my blog.

I'm always on the lookout for the next book coming from her and I feel like a lucky girl to be able to read and review them. I got a glimpse of Brady and Hope in the previous book in this series so I knew that this was a story I wanted to read. Brady and Hope have been great friends for quite awhile. When circumstances lead them to a marriage of convenience, they decide to do it because they they do love each other in a friendly, respectful sort of way, and they both love Sam. Of course marriage leads to a new awareness of each other and what better way to start off a romance then with friendship, right?Hope makes the road a bit bumpy and I'm not sure I completely understood her one-eighty turn around in personality and nature. There were some valid reasons for reluctance and hesitation but her reactions were so extreme and out of character for what I knew of her up to that point. I didn't really like Hope in those moments but all's well that ends well, I guess. :) There is something to say for facing fears and standing and fighting. Thankfully there was Brady. He was the solid, steady one. I loved him from the very beginning and I loved him all through this book. How can a girl resist a guy that fights for his son? Even when he finds out his son isn't his by blood? A girl cannot resist that. Honestly. That is a guy worth keeping.As always, Denise Hunter knows how to bring her characters to life. They feel human and challenged like we all are. Hunter doesn't shy away from the gritty and messy yet always balances it out with the perfect amount of love and hope.

Book 1, Blue Ridge Sunrise, was a disappointment. It was rather edgy and the spiritual content was very light; not what I normally see in her Christian fiction books. Honeysuckle Dreams is better written, has wonderful spiritual content, and very good character and plot development. I loved Hope and Brady's story. In one sense, it reminded me of a mail-order bride book in that they married without a previous courtship but rather in order to allow Brady to keep Sam. Brady's courtship after the marriage was delightful. He took his time to court Hope and allowed their feelings as well as any intimacy to develop slowly. Sam was absolutely adorable, and I couldn't image a better set of parents for him. The courtroom drama was a perfect touch as it kept me wondering what might happen with Sam's custody. Thank you Denise Hunter for returning to your previous endearing writing style."}, {"userName": "Suzie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7431258-suzie", "userReview": "Denise Hunter has once again created a community you want to visit and characters you want to be friends with. In the second Blue Ridge Romance, Hunter combines a friends-to-more story with a marriage of convenience story and it\u2019s one I could not put down.Brady and Hope respect each other, help each other out, and share their joys and struggles with each other. So, when an assumption is made that could help Brady keep his son, Hope willingly agrees to marry Brady. After all, he was a good-looking, stable guy. She couldn\u2019t do much better without giving away her heart.As the two learn to live with each other and spend time in each other\u2019s space, they find a rhythm to married life despite several outside forces intent on pulling them apart.Just when it looks like the marriage is going to become more than a mutual commitment, the past sneaks its tendrils in and challenges both Hope and Brady more than they expect.With the adorable addition of baby Sam and some swoony kisses, Hunter explores the role of friendship in marriage. How mutual respect and communication (or lack thereof) is a solid and firm foundation for more. And how facing the past, no matter how difficult it is, can create a better future.Disclosure statement:I receive complimentary books from publishers, publicists, and/or authors, including NetGalley.

Honeysuckle Dreams shares with these sister books a sweetly romantic story of second chances, facing fears and finding happily ever after.Hope Daniels would do just about anything for her friend Brady Collins. So when Brady\u2019s life is turned upside down and he faces losing the custody rights of his young son, Hope shocks herself by agreeing to a marriage of convenience. What starts as a way to hopefully secure Brady and Sam\u2019s future, slowly begins to morph into something more as Hope and Brady spend more time together and begin to integrate their lives.There\u2019s just something about a marriage of convenience romance. Perhaps because it reminds me of mail order marriages from the western frontier (I rather like a good historical romance). Or maybe because this is a romance novel after all, and I know there is going to be a happy ending. In any case, the marriage of convenience in Honeysuckle Dreams was both romantic and fun. Hope and Brady have been friends for years and it shows in their lively banter, gentle teasing and genuine enjoyment of each other\u2019s company. It\u2019s not a bad place from which to start a marriage. However, both Brady and Hope have suffered many hurts over the years, and, as they overcome some of the challenges that they face and start to fall into the routine of married life, those fears from the past start to rise to the surface. Honeysuckle Dreams was such fun. It was all too easy to suspend any doubts I might have had about the likelihood that the events of the novel would play out in such a way in \u2018real life\u2019. But this is a work of fiction, so who cares about likely or real life. I truly enjoyed Hope and Brady\u2019s relationship. Their friendship was solid and one of good humour, so it was fun to hang with them, especially as they tested the waters of their growing feelings for each other. Baby Sam also added another layer to the story, as did the depth of fear and hurt with which Brady and Hope both struggled. Honeysuckle Dreams can be read as a stand-alone novel, though readers of the first book and the companion novel, Sweetbriar Cottage, will enjoy the character crossover. The characters from the third book, Jack and Daisy, also make an appearance in Honeysuckle Dreams, and I can\u2019t wait to read their story. Honeysuckle Dreams is a sweet, fun and romantic novel, and it touches on timeless themes of second chances, facing one\u2019s fears of the past, and taking a risk on love.The publishers provided an advanced readers copy of this book for reviewing purposes.

This second in her Blue Ridge Romance series is sure to please all her loyal readers and earn her new ones.Brady Collins is a full time dad to his baby son Sam since his ex wife died suddenly. He is also running a full time booming specialty car auto repair business. Then he gets news that sends him into a tailspin. Sam is not his biological son. Then he learns that Sam's maternal grandparents want custody of the baby. Brady's lawyer tells him that things will definitely look better for him if he had a wife to help him raise the baby.

After all, she loves Sam, too, and she and Brady have always gotten along. What could go wrong?Then Hope gets offered her dream job.....a radio talk show position in Atlanta. But she can commute. It will be just fine. Or will it? They marry and things seem to be working out great until some old fears Hope had seemingly buried rear their ugly head. The job in Atlanta now seems to be an escape route for her. She and Brady have now both realized the love each other, but do they really trust? This one is complicated, but with God's help, will they work it out and allow peace and happiness to rule?Denise Hunter always has a knack for creating characters that just get down in your heart, staying long after the last page is turned in the book. The reader feels their heartbreak and their happiness, going along with them as they journey through the difficulties of life, because sometimes love is complicated and sometimes it hurts.Loved this one and now ready for book #3.

I reviewed the first book of the series, Blue Ridge Sunrise, and the main characters are in Honeysuckle Dreams as well. (as secondary characters)Well, let me tell you a little bit about this \"we're just friends\" story. Hope Daniels and Brady Collins have known each other since school days. After Brady's ex-wife dies, Hope helps out with childcare for his baby boy. Well, the two end up pairing up in the most unconventional way to help Brady keep his son. (You're going to love this baby!)Both Hope and Brady have their own personal issues and insecurities to work on. Throughout the story, their friends and family support them through every upheaval. Sometimes with sympathy, and sometimes with a swift kick in the butt. In my opinion, the flashback chapter went on too long. I feel it could have been summed up in a paragraph or two.

If there was ever a thing that robs your emotional & spiritual freedom, this is it. When we are so consumed by fear - there is no room to breathe. Both Hope & Brady have plenty to fear. Much of this story focuses on Brady's battle for his son. It is well written and clearly researched. I appreciate when an author puts in the time to cover all the details accurately. In the beginning you believe that Brady is the one shouldering the majority of the conflict. Hope is a convenient aide, a best friend who comes to his rescue. But as the story progresses, so does our insight into Hope's past. We get a look inside her memories. Painful, heartbreaking and everything becomes clear. The reasons for her anxiety. The nightmares.It's so easy to say, that faith overcomes the fear. There is truth in that, but for the one who has actually 'experienced it' and not just watched it as a bystander (as Denise Hunter states) it can seem overwhelmingly impossible to achieve. Allowing that trust and faith in God, to take the place of fear is the resolution we all want to see with Hope. However, as those of us who have experienced it, such a mountain to climb. Beautiful cover, great location. I'm enjoying this series set in the Georgia countryside. Can\u2019t wait for the next book!! Thank you to Netgalley & Thomas Nelson for the eARC.

I especially loved the timeline of the book and how deep inside both their relationship and also their own personal lives we got to see. Hunter is a master of backstory for her characters. The more you learn about their individual pasts the more you realize why they are the way they are and it is very enlightening. I love seeing their personalities develop through their experiences past and present. I also really enjoy seeing their growth.I really related to Hope in this book. First of all, she is an obvious baby lover devoting all of her free time to caring for Sam. I wanted to crawl into the pages of the book to hold him! But I also tend toward some of her same personality traits especially some of her flaws. It was actually a perfect read for me right now as I've been dealing with some fear - just like Hope. I love when a fiction book can point me back to God and give me hope.It wasn't hard for me to fall for Brady as he is a mechanic and so is my husband. They work on different types of things but so many parts of the story reminded me of my husband! But truly I love what a devoted father he is and how unexpectedly romantic he turned out to be.It was nice to find just a little bit of suspense in this book to add to its romantic storyline. I enjoyed the twist toward the end as it was completely unexpected. I also enjoyed that it branched out just a little bit into the legal side of custody agreements. This book really has it all. I found myself with so many emotions throughout. But I especially loved the romance. I'm a sucker for the marriage of convenience trope. I love watching friends become lovers and found Brady and Hope's love story was super special. I loved how deeply they cared for each other as friends and how committed Brady was to making their unconventional marriage work no matter what. I have to admit I loved reading a book that was more about marriage and less about the leading up to marriage and I loved that it wasn't perfect, but that it was truly realistic with problems that couples face.

It does not impact my review. What I Enjoyed-For most of the book I really liked both Brady and Hope. I thought they made a good team and I enjoyed their blossoming romance. I liked how they interacted with Sam and their friends.-This is more of a Marriage-of-Convenience story than the Fake Relationship I thought it was, but I still liked that aspect of it. It\u2019s one of my favorite tropes and I thought it was well done. I liked that they went into the marriage with the intent of having a real relationship, but that they didn\u2019t rush it.-I thought the storyline regarding Sam\u2019s custody case was well done, if perhaps a little easy. I thought it had great potential for drama, but it was kept in check and I liked that.What Didn\u2019t Work for Me-As I mentioned above, there wasn\u2019t a lot of drama for most of the book, but I felt like it saved it all for the end. Once the custody case was wrapped up I felt like all of a sudden Hope went kind of crazy. While there were a few things said about Hope\u2019s past and fears throughout the book, it felt like it escalated out of nowhere and it really brought down my enjoyment. It felt tacked on and I just didn\u2019t think it was necessary. My biggest complaint with books by this author is that I often find the female lead unlikable and I thought that wasn\u2019t happening in this book, but by the end Hope was really frustrating me.OverallOverall, I enjoyed Honeysuckle Dreams, though the added drama at the end did bring it down a bit for me. I liked the characters for the most part and the Marriage-of-Convenience theme. I look forward to continuing the series.Overall Rating (out of 5): 3.5 Stars"}, {"userName": "Guilty Pleasures Book Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4391611-guilty-pleasures-book-reviews", "userReview": "Honeysuckle Dreams is an unconventional marriage of convenience romance when a friend helps out another friend in a very big way. Brady Collins is in a custody battle for his son with his ex-in-laws once it was realized that he isn\u2019t Sam\u2019s biological father. Hope Daniels has been helping take care of Sam while Brady works and will do anything to help out her friend. They devise a plan to marry to not only help Brady, but Hope will finally get the family she\u2019s always wanted without love and its complications. She thought it was a perfect solution until she fell in love with her husband.I was pleasantly surprised how easy and engaging this story was from beginning to end considering the predictability of the premise. Things aren\u2019t that simple especially when emotions and damaged pasts play a part for the main characters. Brady first marriage to Sam\u2019s mother ended bitterly and Brady didn\u2019t have confidence to enter the dating realm again after the number she did on him. Hope didn\u2019t want to face heartache again after losing her high school sweetheart tragically. She thought marrying Brady was the answer to a lifelong dream of being a wife and mother. It was good in the beginning but then things took a turn when she realized she loved Brady and didn\u2019t want to lose him. Brady didn\u2019t know how to deal with her issues when he had some of his own. Fortunately, both had to comes to terms with their pasts and they needed to rely on their faith to get them there.Hunter has a wonderful way of writing a charming friend to lover\u2019s story with conflict and resolution for readers to thoroughly enjoy. There is good dialogue throughout sprinkled with a bit of humor and romantic references to some wonderful old movies. The characters are relatable and you feel their struggles of self-worth and anxiety and how they cope. Even the custody battle had a few twists I didn\u2019t see coming. This book was thoroughly satisfying. Honeysuckle Dreams is a good addition in the Blue Ridge series, and I look forward to more of Hunter\u2019s stories."}, {"userName": "Kelly Bridgewater", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33835690-kelly-bridgewater", "userReview": "I really enjoyed Denise Hunter's Chapel Hill series and the Summer Harbor Series. They weren't like the majority of contemporary romance published. She digs deep into her characters and really hunts for the deep flaw in their lives and tosses it to the wind while creating a masterful climax with the a member of the opposite sex. But with her new series, A Blue Ridge Romance, I don't feel the same way.The writing is still top notch. Hunter really dives into her character's emotions. I understand Brady and Hope's feelings for each other and empathize with them as they move around the story. I can see the setting and understand where I am without any real difficulty.The plot seemed really rushed to me. For the first forty-two percent of the book, Hunter rushes through two months of time and rushes to a court hearing. Then the next two months fly by for the rest of the book to show the downfall of the characters. I really didn't understand why the sudden emotional change in Hope either. One day she shuts Brady out, and the item that triggers it seemed out of place. Hope becomes dis-attached and depressed, which I didn't see coming and is completely out of character for the build-up of the character for the first half of the book.I liked Hope and Brady at the beginning of the novel, and they have a nice communication together. But then the story seems forced on the characters. Hope doesn't think twice about what Brady is asking her to do. I think any normal person would have needed to think it over. There is so much she and he doesn't take into consideration.Overall, Honeysuckle Dreams by Denise Hunter didn't appear realistic and too rushed. I don't think characters did things that would have fit their personalities. The plot moved too rapidly leaving me confused and wondering why I'm still reading the book. I recommend skipping this book and picking up her previous writings. However, fans of Hunter's other stories and contemporary romance might enjoy this novel. This is my humble opinion.I received a complimentary copy of Honeysuckle Dreams by Denise Hunter from Thomas Nelson Publishing, but the opinions stated are all my own."}, {"userName": "Kristen", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1071692-kristen", "userReview": "In Denise Hunter's Honeysuckle Dreams, the second installment in the Blue Ridge romance series, this inspirational romance would uplift your spirits and warm your hearts.

I've not read anything by Denise before, but I vastly enjoyed her writing. While this is book two in a series, it can be read as a standalone. From what I understand these are characters mentioned in book one but book two is their story.Overall, Denise weaves a beautiful tale with vivid writing. This story shows us how people can stand up for whats right even when its not easy. That sometimes we need to give it to the Lord and pray for our answers. When things in life are handed to us but comes at a price what do we choose?The characters in this novel really drove the story along! You see how both Brady and Hope really have a deep friendship and want to help one another. however you see Hope question if its what is best to do in order to get what she wants. This book gives us a lot of food for thought and comes with great lessons.5/5 stars.I received a complimentary copy of this book from Thomas Nelson through NetGalley.

Honeysuckle Dreams by far surpasses them all! This book stirs deep within your soul running the gamut at emotions- laughing, crying, grief, & joy. Ms. Hunter does an excellent job tackling the tough issues of marriage, death, drug abuse, and child custody. Each storyline is well developed pulling you inside the story. Hope and Brady\u2019s stories both individually and as a couple have pieces that will connect with each of us. The reader sees the relationship blossoming before Hope & Brady do and we are able to follow them thru every trial they face. We learn the importance of trust and open communication from them.
