{"ratings": 6, "userreviews": [], "description": "\"Today I am an unemployed writer living as a recluse in the great Northwoods.\" So begins this North Country journal from the author of THIS SIDE OF A WILDERNESS. In the spring of 2011, Mr. Rice resigned from his career with the U.S. Geological Survey, and moved alone into a tent deep in the forests of northern Minnesota. THE UNPEOPLED SEASON is his daily record of the four months in isolation. But it is more than a catalog of events. It is a compassionate and introspective quest into mankind's connection to wild places. He writes with humor about his follies and foibles, shares technical know-how about setting up camp, ruminates on fishing, introduces wild animals, and discusses the often invigorating, occasionally disconcerting, task of completing his first novel.", "title": "The Unpeopled Season: Journal from a North Country Wilderness", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24340045-the-unpeopled-season", "average": 4.0, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1420793225l/24340045.jpg", "reviews": 0, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7641297.Daniel_J_Rice", "name": "Daniel J.
