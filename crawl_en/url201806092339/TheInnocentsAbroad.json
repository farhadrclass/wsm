I don't recall his name, but I decided to call him Stan. It drove him crazy, but I called him Stan anyway. Why did I call him Stan?One word: Ferguson.Ferguson is every tour guide that graces the pages of Mark Twain's The Innocents Abroad. The author and his cohort call their guides Ferguson, whether in Paris or in Athens. The name drives each Ferguson crazy, but they do it anyway. And regardless of the site, or museum, their attitude before the remains of some long-ago Renaissance man is the same: \"Is . . . is he dead?\" This also drives the Fergusons crazy.Is this admirable? No, but it epitomizes the experience of Americans abroad. It is brash, showing at once disdain for and secret envy of the old world, its people, and its institutions.This is the book that instilled in me a wanderlust that still afflicts me, even though I have rarely been able to satisfy it. I wanted to travel the world and call my guides Ferguson. I still do."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael", "userReview": "I love certain travel books, ones that give you an inspiring window on places you\u2019ve never been or want to revisit while holding a humbling mirror up to the perspective and culture of the traveler. \u201cInnocents Abroad\u201d is a classic that fulfills this goal nicely and a fun read to boot. In 1867, the nearly unknown journalist Mark Twain set out at age 32 on a chartered ship from New York with a group of Americans for a three-month tour around the Mediterranean with major overland side-trips. His itinerary overlapped some of my own school trip many years ago to educational sites Italy, Greece, and Turkey. But it also included forays into France, Russia, North Africa, and the Middle East, capped by a facinating inland trip by horse and camel from Damascus to Jerusalem. Here is a map of his journey:I appreciate the combination of self-deprecation, wonder, slapstick humor and cynicism represented in Twain\u2019s writing. The following quotes capture his nobler sentiments:The gentle reader will never, never know what a consummate ass he can become, until he goes abroad. I speak now, of course, in the supposition that the gentle reader has not been abroad, and therefore is not already a consummate ass.---Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things can not be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime.---Human nature appears to be just the same, all over the world.For his sense of wonder, here are a few examples of his eloquence from experience of people in the streets of Constantinople, of the ruins of the Appian way, and of the ancient Sphinx in Egypt:People were thicker than bees, in those narrow streets, and the men were dressed in all the outrageous, outlandish, idolatrous, extravagant, thunder-and-lightning costumes that ever a tailor with the delirium tremens and seven devils could conceive of.---Gray lizards, those heirs of ruin, of sepulchres and desolation, glided in and out among the rocks or lay still and sunned themselves. Where prosperity has reigned, and fallen; where glory has flamed, and gone out; where beauty has dwelt, and passed away; where gladness was, and sorrow is; where the pomp of life has been, and silence and death brood in its high places, there this reptile makes his home, and mocks at human vanity. His coat is the color of ashes: and ashes are the symbol of hopes that have perished, of aspirations that came to nought, of loves that are buried. If he could speak, he would say, Build temples: I will lord it in their ruins; build palaces: I will inhabit them; erect empires: I will inherit them; bury your beautiful: I will watch the worms at their work; and you, who stand here and moralize over me: I will crawl over your corpse at the last.---I gave it up and walked down to the Sphynx. After years of waiting, it was before me at last. The great face was so sad, so earnest, so longing, so patient. There was a dignity not of earth in its mien, and in its countenance a benignity such as never any thing human wore. It was stone, but it seemed sentient. If ever image of stone thought, it was thinking. It was looking toward the verge of the landscape, yet looking at nothing\u2014nothing but distance and vacancy. It was looking over and beyond every thing of the present, and far into the past. It was gazing out over the ocean of Time\u2014over lines of century-waves which, further and further receding, closed nearer and nearer together, and blended at last into one unbroken tide, away toward the horizon of remote antiquity.Humor is tucked into every page, providing comic relief without dominating the story. Galloping pell-mell on donkeys through the streets of a town in the Azores is one example that stands out for me. The humor often barbs both ways, as in this example  In Paris they just simply opened their eyes and stared when we spoke to them in French! We never did succeed in making those idiots understand their own language.Another vein of humor comes from playing practical jokes on the tourist guides, which in every country they call \u201cFerguson\u201d to save on mastering a foreign name. In one case, after getting tired of too much hype over Michelangelo\u2019s creations, the travelers keep pestering their guide with questions about his responsibility of ancient structures like the Roman Forum. For a similar deflation of their guide\u2019s pressures to revere Columbus, here is a joke they played on him:He took us to the municipal palace. After much impressive fumbling of keys and opening of locks, the stained and aged document was spread before us. The guide\u2019s eyes sparkled. He danced about us and tapped the parchment with his finger: \u201cWhat I tell you, genteelmen! Is it not so? See! handwriting Christopher Colombo!--write it himself!\u201d We looked indifferent--unconcerned. The doctor examined the document very deliberately, during a painful pause.--Then he said, without any show of interest: \u201cAh--Ferguson--what--what did you say was the name of the party who wrote this?\u201d \u201cChristopher Colombo! ze great Christopher Colombo!\u201d Another deliberate examination. \u201cAh--did he write it himself; or--or how?\u201d \u201cHe write it himself!--Christopher Colombo! He\u2019s own hand-writing, write by himself!\u201d Then the doctor laid the document down and said: \u201cWhy, I have seen boys in America only fourteen years old that could write better than that.\"On the negative side, personal cultural bias comes out in many places. References abound to the dirtiness of the people in many countries, hygiene issues such as mustache hair on the women, and the rapaciousness of the beggars. The great efforts to find soap at hotels throughout the journey is funny at times, but overdone. I sympathize with Twain over his cynicism over the obsessive collection and promotion of holy relics by Catholic churches. There are just too many nails he was crucified with on display and too many bones of saints honored in shrines to foster meaningful spirituality. Aristocratic excess is a perennial target for American sensibility, and so is the contrast between religious pomp of prelates and the poverty of the people. While his meeting with the Russian Czar in Yalta made Twain recognize his ordinary humanity, just thinking about the Muslim Caliph in Constantinople with hundreds of wives makes him see hypocrisy in the whole religious enterprise. Here is his anti-Catholic rant on ItalyAs far as I can see, Italy, for fifteen hundred years, has turned all her energies, all her finances, and all her industry to the building up of a vast array of wonderful church edifices, and starving half her citizens to accomplish it. She is today one vast museum of magnificence and misery. All the churches in an ordinary American city put together could hardly buy the jeweled frippery in one of her hundred cathedrals. And for every beggar in America, Italy can show a hundred - and rags and vermin to match. It is the wretchedest, princeliest land on earth. \u2026O, sons of classic Italy, is the spirit of enterprise, of self-reliance, of noble endeavor, utterly dead within ye? Curse your indolent worthlessness, why don't you rob your church?Despite this apparent cynicism, it was fascinating to experience Twain\u2019s underlying reverence with respect to the sites of the Holy Land. In Jerusalem, you can feel his underlying judgment of commercial hype over supposed sites where Mary supposedly stood or stayed, where Christ rested a moment as he bore his cross toward Calvary, etc. But at many other points his awe comes through over sites that remind him how an ordinary fisherman from Nazareth who sailed the Galilee with his brothers came to change the world through his spiritual vision. In process of this read, I came to appreciate the evolution of Twain\u2019s own sensibilities and the story-telling skills that would shape the landscape of American literature."}, {"userName": "Patrick", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3251334-patrick", "userReview": "This novel is part stand-up comedy and part history lesson. Throughout the novel Twain is hysterically funny, irreverent, lampooning, and blatantly racist--a classic American traveling abroad. This travel log touches upon almost every tourist spot in Europe, North Africa, and the Holy Land. Twain covers many of the most important sites in Europe in a thorough manner. The text would become tedious if not for the wit and clever turning of phrases throughout the work. The humor does have quite an edge. The racism and bigotry showed by the author in this piece does not kill the story, in my estimation, it only makes Twain a man of his time.Mark Twain walks up to the top inside the Leaning Tower of Pisa, visits Florence and the Vatican, sees holy sites throughout current day Israel and Jordan, and even visits the Sphinx and the pyramids. In many ways, Twain remains unchanged by his journey. He feels that the clergy at every church are trying to rip him off with fake relics; of course, often he is right. The prejudices that he carried with him do not change. He refers to Muslims as \"pagans\" and \"savages,\" equating them with his low view of the Native Americans (p.406). He and his companions refused to use the names of their guides, instead refer to one and all as \"Ferguson.\" \"Of course the real name of the place is El something of other, but the boys still refuse to recognize the Arab names or try to pronounce them\" (p.299).There are some great scenes in this novel. Twain at the grave of Adam in the Holy Land, from Adam and Eve fame, is fantastic. Twain breaks down sobbing over visiting the grave of a long lost 'relative' this far from home. Adam is a relation six thousand years down the family tree, in the author's estimation, but still a kinsman. Another wonderful image is of Twain and his companions riding through the desert on battered, broken horses with purple parasols to keep the sun off of them. Good quotes: p.311 \"I could not conceive of a small country having so large a history.\"p.424 \"Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow mindedness, and many of our people needed it sorely on these accounts.\""}, {"userName": "Chrissie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie", "userReview": "This armchair travel guide is based on an actual journey made by Twain in 1867. He was only thirty-two. It first came out in the New York Herald, peu \u00e0 peu as he sent in his journal entries. Only later in 1869 was it published as a book. The excursion route can be seen here: http://twain.lib.virginia.edu/innocen...By clicking on the map you are linked to the text in the book referring to the particular location. In this way you can check out Twain's writing.So what makes this a classic, and why is it so highly praised? For its humor and Twain\u2019s delightful knack at expressing himself. He has a way with words. He is opinionated, which is quite fun; he dares to say what he thinks. Some of his views are dated and quite simply not politically correct. One does have to keep in mind that the book was published a century and a half ago. On the other hand, many cultural tendencies do not change. You recognize these and smile at the kernels of truth that lie in Twain\u2019s observations, observations made long, long ago and yet still valid. Not all, but some. The book has historical content. There are tons of little tidbits that are interesting. According to him, Damascus is said to be the oldest city in the world, and some think even the Garden of Eden. Twain was at the second world\u2019s fair, The International Exposition of 1867 held in Paris. He tells of us his experiences first hand. He and some others took another side tour to Odessa on the Black Sea and there met with the Russian Czar and Czarina, Nicholas and Alexandra, in their summer palace in the Crimea. He visited the Leaning Tour of Pisa. He tells us that it feels as though, if you go to the edge, you weight will topple it over. He and three friends sneak out of the ship moored outside the port Piraeus; against imposed quarantine regulations they go into Athens, see the Acropolis by moonlight, steal grapes, are chased and finally return to the ship by dawn. Such escapades transform interesting factual details into personal tales. Twain is perceived as a friend telling you of what he saw and experienced. He is relaxed; he speaks from the heart. Twain wonderfully captures the essence of many, many places. What makes Paris Paris and Constantinople Constantinople? Versailles, Milan, Venice, Rome, Pompeii. Don\u2019t forget to look at the map above!The humor is intellectual. It is for those of us who have traveled and have themselves thought about cultural peculiarities. Twain pokes fun. Sometimes at himself and sometimes at others. His travelling companions cannot be bothered to learn the names of their guides so they call them \nall\n Fergusson! This they can pronounce. Yet this also shows their ridiculous sense of self-importance. In France, none of the French understand what they say, but it never occurs to them that this is due to their own inability to speak the language properly. Such is the humor. Humor circling around culture. There are pokes at the Catholic Church and the grandiose claims made in the travel guides of his time.I had planned on giving the book four stars. I enjoyed it all the way through \nuntil \n the excursion arrived in the Middle East. Here I began to have serious trouble. Twain's prejudicial view of Arabs is disturbing, at least for those of us with a modern sensibility. From this point on his deprecatory views reverberate in all that he relates. In the latter third of the book his negative views become a rant. The humor became sour and repetitive. His distaste for Arab nations and people prevented him from appreciating what these lands could have offered him. His attitude just wrecks the fun. What began as a pleasure excursion of curiosity, exploration and discovery ends as a \"funeral excursion without a corpse\". These are his own words, found at the book\u2019s conclusion. I feel they appropriately capture the book\u2019s end. I must clarify that despite numerous tribulations no one died on the trip. The audiobook is wonderfully narrated by Grover Gardner. Easy to follow and spoken at a perfect speed. The Americans speaking French are totally hysterical. This adds to the humor. The narration is just how it should be, and so have given it five stars.This book is interesting and very funny. Unfortunately, that ends when Twain arrives in the Middle East!"}, {"userName": "Bryce Wilson", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/605328-bryce-wilson", "userReview": "God you've got to love Twain.

How do you measure the level of his genius? I don't know. Physicists used to rate the genius level of other physicists on a scale of 1- 10, and then along came Dick Feynman whom everyone agreed was \"off-scale\". Twain's ability as a writer might just be \"off-scale\", too. I have seen estimates of Goethe's and Shakespeare's IQs which are at the top end of all humanity's and I'm quite sure Mark Twain is at least their equal, intellectually. Thank god for Mark Twain, accessible to the common man, and more fun than a barrel of monkeys. The term LOL (which means \"Laugh Out Loud\") takes on a whole new meaning when you read Twain. I remember the last time I laughed out loud like this was when I was commuting back and forth to work from the Upper West Side to Midtown on the IRT. As you know, Manhattan subways are pretty sober places and the cold fluorescent light and the bitter taste/smell of the lingering asbestos brake particles in the air and the other vaguely metallic and pungent smells of the underground train lair lends a sort of uber-reality to the scene (as do the grim faces of the people on the train contending as they are with the harsh business of survival in one of the roughest cities in the world) I was reading Roughing It!, one of Twain's other works, on those hard, cold grey seats on the sides of the train with people on either side of me and across from me and I would burst out laughing every page or so and people would look at me as if there was something wrong with me and I would say, \"I'm sorry, this is really funny.\" And I would hold out the book for them to see and then they would go back to staring out into the space in front of themselves rather than looking at me like I had broken some sort of Law of the Subway. And then I would go back to reading and laughing out loud because Twain is so very, very wry. It's too bad you can't bottle what Twain has to say, because if you could, you'd be drunker than a 100 Indians dancing in a cornfield on the first sip.

Part of the problem here is that the world has become so politically correct that all the members of my book club agreed that we cringed at the frequent places where Twain was unkind, cruel, and usually very, very wrong about the people in the area. The Portugese, Carthegenians, and Syrians are only a few which he castigated. As a group we agreed that Twain's opinions were probably the mainstream opinions of most Americans of the time. There are many worthwhile chapters in the book, but it should be read with the knowledge that a 19th Century man is writing it to a 21st Century audience."}, {"userName": "Thom Swennes", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3690472-thom-swennes", "userReview": "Mark Twain\u2019s Innocents Abroad is a travel book. I have no doubt that it is a travel book because that is exactly how Mark Twain described it. It is, however, much more than a travel book. It is a classic example of how American\u2019s (more often than not) behave in foreign countries. The passing of 145 years (published in 1867) hasn\u2019t changed the American mentality in the least. Twain\u2019s pilgrimage was to southern Europe and the Holy Lands. His descriptions of fellow passengers and people they met were both colorful and humorous. As an American expatriate in Europe I can see and enjoy both sides of his described confrontations. This volume of prose also affords the reader a rare glimpse at the true Samuel Clements. Away from his native shores and surrounded by foreigners his choice of words take on a more \u201cpolitical correct\u201d form and the commonly used word \u201cnigger\u201d is replaced with the more acceptable word \u201cnegro.\u201d Although Samuel Clements forefathers owned slaves long before his birth (and the added fact that he enlisted for a short time in the Confederate Army) he wasn\u2019t a slavery advocate. In fact, his descriptions of Negros, both free and slave, did as much for these groups as Stowe\u2019s unforgettable book.His tour of the Holy Lands, though occasionally a little long winded, is full of geographical, historical and theological facts. He points to and points out flaws in all and humorously presents logical assumptions and deductions. I have come to expect much from this reputed American author and have not been disappointed. Occasionally trifles, such as Twain\u2019s aversion or dismissal of all European currencies as franks, but I had not problem in overlooking these. It is a lesser known masterpiece but masterpiece no less. I recommend it to everyone."}, {"userName": "Marc Weitz", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3577919-marc-weitz", "userReview": "I found myself anxious to read this book expecting to enjoy the application of Mark Twain's wit to traveling abroad in Europe in 1867. The wit was there but hidden away amongst loads and loads of boring descriptions and events. Reading this book was like watching soccer: there were moments of interest tucked away in long minutes of people running around in a circle. So much so, that when the funny or interesting parts came up, I found that I would miss the beginning because I had zoned out.This book is about Mark Twain's trip to Europe in 1867 aboard a cruise ship. Surprisingly, this is one of Mark Twain's early works. A travelogue is usually the type of book written by an established author, whom the reader anticipates hearing their perspective on traveling based on being a fan of their fiction.I'll start with the goods parts: First there are some very funny parts. Mark Twain does a great job making fun of the places he goes to and dealing with the constant cultural differences and people trying to sell them goods they don't need. Also, it interesting to read that travel 150 years ago wasn't all that different. Some of the conversations and complaints Mark Twain has with his traveling companions sound amazingly like those I have today with my friends. I viewed this period as a golden age of travel, but, for example, shops in Paris put up signs saying that they speak English, when they didn't, only to lure tourists in to buy goods. And wherever Twain goes, he is hounded by men offering to be his guide. The bad part: Most of it. So boring that I felt like I was reading a text book. Long, long, long descriptions of the places they visited that I could care less about. This was before photography really took off, so these long descriptions were for the benefit of the reader. It's also ironic that at the end is Mark Twain's famous quote \"Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness...\" because he spends almost the entire book bagging on foreigners, their culture, and comparing it to back home where things are better. I finished reading this book with the impression that everyone and everything abroad just sucks, except for a few pretty churches here and there.Skip this boring book."}, {"userName": "Daren", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11995655-daren", "userReview": "As I made my way through the pages of this book, I became more and more concerned. I reached about halfway, and we were still in France, having departed New York, visited the Azores, Gibraltar, Spain and undertaken a sidetrip to Tangier. As I reached the three quarter mark, and we were in Venice. I returned to the title pages, scouring for a clue as to my concern. Rechecking the published agenda of the steamship - yes, definitely a trip to the Holy Lands... Yes definitely a lot of Europe is listed, but, hell we are running out of pages!So despite no indication to suggest this was volume 1 of The Innocents Abroad, it does in fact end as we prepare to leave Pompeii.A little about this edition, which, despite being only half the book, is quite attractive. It is a 1910 hardcover edition with an embossed cover and spine, gold leaf on the spine. The embossed pattern is a geometric Art Nouveau pattern, and inside the cover is an amazing peacock artwork, also in Art Nouveau style with a boxed border.

It was excellent, and having read the relevant sections of the full book now, can say the excerpts were very well selected, and it really did pick some of the best writing.As much as I enjoyed this book - and I did - the great writing, the relentless ridiculing of almost anything or anyone, the interesting side-stories, legends and local stories - what I was really looking forward to was the second part of the journey, beyond Europe. Greece, Turkey, Cyprus, Israel, Beirut, Jordan, Egypt, followed by returning again through Europe.Some quick google found a copy of the book I could download, so the second volume beckons, but it is likely to be a slow burner, as I dislike reading from the screen.

I've read the usual Mark Twain: Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. I had never even heard of this book before and read it only because it was the book for my book club. It's taken me quite awhile to finish it, but I am so glad I pushed through and determined to finish it. It is in a very different style than what I went into it expecting it to have. I think I expected dry, dull, monotonous descriptions of his travels. Not only were his descriptions much more interesting than I pre-judged they would be, the descriptions were peppered with genuine, laugh-out-loud humor. I finished this book last night and have caught myself smiling or giggling to myself as I think about the book today as I go about my work.One other thing-I don't know anything about Twain's religious upbringing or background. I have always had the impression that he was not a religious or spiritual man. However, I was impressed with his seeming knowledge of the Bible, particularly as I was reading his account of the Holy Land. Despite his making fun of a lot of religious practices and traditions that he observed as he traveled, he clearly had a core of Bible knowledge. That surprised me as well.The only thing that could have improved this book for me would be listening to Mark Twain himself read it on audiobook. I can only imagine how much more that would have enhanced the reading experience of this book for me. In my literary fantasy world, I would love to go to dinner or coffee (or both) with Mark Twain.

I deflected the imperative to read it by giving it to my son, but when he returned it, I decided to dive in. This is one of Twain's famous books. He embarks on a voyage to Europe and the Middle East in 1869. Obviously dated and extensively written (he could have used a good editor), it is nevertheless worth the time it takes to sit down and enjoy his story. The book was a compilation of letters to a San Francisco newspaper; well received, he was launched on his career as a writer. Tom Sawyer came nine years later and Huckleberry Finn another nine after that. It is an interesting read, Twain shows much of his capacity for insight and humour and his ability to look at things from an ironic perspective. His talent as a keen observer of mores and foibles of his fellow Americans is particularly fun; he may not be the first to comment on the clumsiness and inappropriateness of American travellers, but he makes good use of their mindless self-absorption for humour. It is a good book for long rainy winter weather.

This book is a collection of the reports he wrote back home during the trip. I haven't read much by Mark Twain, and that was many years ago so I wasn't sure what to expect. Based on this account I am sad to report that he seemed like kind of an asshole. He went through this amazing adventure apparently determined to find the worst in everyone and everything he saw, and to report that almost every experience fell short of his expectations. His descriptions were generally merciless and very, very long.Still, there was a lot to like in this novel and I have to rate this with 5 stars just because it is just SO incredibly cool to have this detailed account of travel 150 years ago. Imagine being in Istanbul (then Constantinople) when it wasn't a modern city, but instead still full of people in exotic Arabian dress, riding camels and donkeys. Imagine visiting the great Pyramids before King Tut's tomb was even discovered. Imagine Rome and Paris and other European cities before they were changed forever by two World Wars. Imagine being taken to meet the Russian Tzar and his family, simply because travelers from the US were so rare. (Note, I imagine I would enjoy all of these things much more if cranky old Twain wasn't among the party, complaining about everything.) Twain is famous for his wit, but for the most part I founds his observations more mean-spirited than funny. But there were three specific scenes that made me laugh so hard I cried; the kind of funny that I know will forever make me start giggling again just thinking about them - I can't help but like a book that gives me that gift. I have been to many of the places he describes, but never to the Holy Land. He was surprisingly knowledgeable about the Bible, and his descriptions in that section alone was worth putting up with some of the more boring parts. So in short, this book is definitely not for everyone, but for me it was ultimately worth the time.[WARNING: If by some chance my review intrigues you, but you are a person who gets offended easily, I caution that you will be triggered. For example, I am 100% Italian, and I was informed repeatedly that Twain found us all to be lazy, dirty, smelly and stupid. He really warmed to this topic and returned to it again and again. To be fair, he was contemptuous of most of the other foreign people that he encountered, especially Muslims - he was really NOT a fan. So anyway, just picking up the novel probably makes you a racist and and an Islamophobe. Also a misogynist because he thought most women of other nationalities were ugly. There was also some distressing animal cruelty. You know what, don't even bother reading it, just start demanding that it be banned.]"}, {"userName": "Naftoli", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5466619-naftoli", "userReview": "This travel log is one of the best books by Twain I have read. His observations throughout Europe and the Holy Land are hilarious, reflective, multi-layered, derogatory, compassionate, insightful, and at times tediously introspective; in short it looks, feels, and reads like typical Twain. Additionally, the reader sees with a new pair of eyes, that is, a mid-19thcentury American Protestant set of eyes. But not always, at times Twain demonstrates a citizen-of-the-world worldview before diving back into an American one. Keenly self-aware, he even describes his forays into subjectively. This account is not only intriguing due to Twain\u2019s travels and his analysis thereof, but because it preserves \u2013 in written form \u2013 a view of Europe and the Middle East as it was in the mid-1800s. This was a time when, according to Twain, most Europeans knew little of America and Americans and those that did looked upon it as a barbarous horde scarcely on the fringe of civilization. Surely this could not be said today.I especially enjoyed his critiques of tour guides throughout Europe and the Middle East. In France he and his travel companions lit upon the idea that the names were absolutely unpronounceable so they called their first French guide \u2018Ferguson.\u2019 Thereafter all guides were referred to as Ferguson. This often annoyed the guides but the Americans abroad saw it as a payback as the guides invariably fabricated stories and led them on wild goose chases to places they did not want to visit. In the Arab lands the locals were especially vexing due to beggary. The word \u2018baksheesh\u2019 (tip) will be forever tattooed upon his memory as he and his companions were hassled and harangued everywhere throughout those lands by demands for baksheesh. Not only did beggars demand it but nothing could be gotten or learned without putting money on someone\u2019s hand. Twain found the incessant demands for baksheesh tormenting.If I had access to a time machine, I would very much like to be Twain\u2019s traveling companion; he is an extremely entertaining man!"}, {"userName": "Sherrie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1604092-sherrie", "userReview": "Twain \"lost me\" during the second half of the trip, when the pilgrims head for the Holy Land. Seeing as how I spent 12 years in Catholic school (16 if you count attending a Jesuit university too) I found all the Bibleland stuff horribly tedious and not very amusing.Plus travelling with Twain is not as wonderful as one would think! He is close-minded, comparing everything in Europe to the size of things back in America (Lake Tahoe is a reoccurring reference point) and is mostly in a bad mood when he discovers that what he has read in guide books is all completely untrue. He is unmoved by the masterworks of the Renaissance but spends a lot of time talking about the conditions of the roads as they travel. Would you want to be stuck on a cruise ship with a guy who is constantly talking about how big the state of Missouri is?

It's the best that I've ever read. Twain's wit sparkles throughout. Usually he simply describes what he and his friends are doing. When he needs to he can wax as eloquently as Frances Mayes. His observations are unsparing, often taking opposing views from the \"travel mythology.\" For example, he's at a loss to explain the popularity of the great mosque in Istanbul and has few kind words for the Arabs and Jews in the Holy Land. His trip starts out on a steamer in New York, goes to the Canary Islands, Gibralter, Morocco, France, Italy, Greece, Turkey, and Palestine. Much of the trip is overland: on trains in Europe and broken down old nags in Palestine broiling in heat, and avoiding bandits. Much of what he comments about are things that affect tourism today, such has the penchant for his fellow travelers of breaking off pieces of rocks and statues to take home.

Consequently, I feel like Roughing It is the better book since Twain matured as a writer in the three year interval. There were fewer side stories in this one, but still plenty of amusing observations.The first half covers his trip through southern Europe, and the second half sticks to the travels in the Holy Land. Throughout all of it are beggars and poor people who hound him and his party the entire time in every city. Unlike Dickens who is the poor man's champion, Twain has nothing kind to say about any of them. But he wouldn't be Mark Twain if he didn't exploit such things with his dry wit. The result is hilarious, but some of the running themes become a bit tiresome after several hundred pages, and so I didn't enjoy the second half of the book as much. Still, his highfalutin disdain for the common rabble, or any non male WASP is an absolute scream.This is just a stab in the dark, but I'm guessing Twain didn't care much for the Arabs. I've never seen such lambasting. Well, actually I have, but this is definitely top tier. He saw the sword of Godfrey of Bouillon which is a blade that absolutely could not hit a Christian and would also seek out a Mohammedan. Twain took it to test this legend, and it was true! He attempted to stab his friend, and instead struck a nearby Moslem in the heart when the blade veered off course of its own volition. Or something like that. He and his friend marveled over this miracle as he wiped the sword off and put it back on the wall, then went on with the tour.Tour guides in Europe don't come off looking very good. Neither do sailors, the clergy, townsfolk, shop keepers, the other passengers on the ship, or almost anybody, really. Whether someone had a slew of faults, just one, or none at all, Twain skewers and roasts them. The few exceptions are Napoleon III of France, the Emperor of Russia (I think it was Alexander II), and a couple other people I can't recall off the top of my head. He was definitely not impressed with Sultan Abdulaziz who was...\"...Born to a throne; weak, stupid, ignorant, almost, as his meanest slave; chief of a vast royalty, yet the puppet of his Premier and the obedient child of a tyrannical mother; a man who sits upon a throne--the beck of whose finger moves navies and armies--who holds in his hands the power of life and death over millions--yet who sleeps, sleeps, eats, eats, idles with his eight hundred concubines, and when he is surfeited with eating and sleeping and idling, and would rouse up and take the reins of government and threaten to be a sultan, is charmed from his purpose by wary Fuad Pacha with a pretty plan for a new palace or a new ship--charmed away with a new toy, like any other restless child; a man who sees his people robbed and oppressed by soulless tax-gatherers, but speaks no word to save them; who believes in gnomes and genii and the wild fables of The Arabian Nights, but has small regard for the mighty magicians of to-day, and is nervous in the presence of their mysterious railroads and steamboats and telegraphs; who would see undone in Egypt all that great Mehemet Ali achieved, and would prefer rather to forget than emulate him; a man who found his great empire a blot upon the earth--a degraded, poverty-stricken, miserable, infamous agglomeration of ignorance, crime, and brutality--and will idle away the allotted days of his trivial life and then pass to the dust and the worms and leave it so!\"Gracious. Tell us how you really feel. I do remember he was impressed with parts of Syria, though. Things sure have changed a lot since then, and I doubt his 31 year old self would feel the same way about the place were he to visit it today.I enjoyed the stories he was told in Jerusalem where every single stone had a significance, at least as far as the guides were concerned. \"This divot in the stone here is where the savior stumbled while carrying the cross, and was marked with his elbow.\" That kind of thing. We also get the tale of the Wandering Jew who has done everything he can to die, but just can't manage it. Attempts include, but are not limited to going to the front of every war fought in the last 1800+ years to run in front of sword thrusts and bullets, and also prospecting in cholera, malaria, and the like.I said Roughing It had more side stories, but that doesn't mean there aren't plenty in here as well. Some of the best were his retelling of common stories with a few changes. (We're assured he gives us the true versions). At least they were common 150 years ago, though I think only more educated people know of them today. Since radio, movies, TV and the internet came along, the passing along of old tales has fallen by the wayside. Instead of mentioning a few here, I'll leave you with just one in its entirety. It's the tale of Abelard and Heloise. Twain and this pumpkin both seem to feel about it the same way I do.\nEveryone thinks they know the story. Abelard had a love affair with Heloise. Some people didn't like it and cut off his dick. (In the movie Stealing Heaven, Heloise's despondent cry when she finds out makes her seem more upset about it than Abelard). Later she becomes a nun, and they write letters to each other. This is supposedly the most tragically romantic thing that ever happened in the history of the world, but Mark is here to set the record straight. Take it away Mr. Twain:But among the thousands and thousands of tombs in Pere la Chaise, there is one that no man, no woman, no youth of either sex, ever passes by without stopping to examine. Every visitor has a sort of indistinct idea of the history of its dead and comprehends that homage is due there, but not one in twenty thousand clearly remembers the story of that tomb and its romantic occupants. This is the grave of Abelard and Heloise\u2014a grave which has been more revered, more widely known, more written and sung about and wept over, for seven hundred years, than any other in Christendom save only that of the Saviour. All visitors linger pensively about it; all young people capture and carry away keepsakes and mementoes of it; all Parisian youths and maidens who are disappointed in love come there to bail out when they are full of tears; yea, many stricken lovers make pilgrimages to this shrine from distant provinces to weep and wail and \"grit\" their teeth over their heavy sorrows, and to purchase the sympathies of the chastened spirits of that tomb with offerings of immortelles and budding flowers.Go when you will, you find somebody snuffling over that tomb. Go when you will, you find it furnished with those bouquets and immortelles. Go when you will, you find a gravel-train from Marseilles arriving to supply the deficiencies caused by memento-cabbaging vandals whose affections have miscarried.Yet who really knows the story of Abelard and Heloise? Precious few people. The names are perfectly familiar to every body, and that is about all. With infinite pains I have acquired a knowledge of that history, and I propose to narrate it here, partly for the honest information of the public and partly to show that public that they have been wasting a good deal of marketable sentiment very unnecessarily.STORY OF ABELARD AND HELOISEHeloise was born seven hundred and sixty-six years ago. She may have had parents. There is no telling. She lived with her uncle Fulbert, a canon of the cathedral of Paris. I do not know what a canon of a cathedral is, but that is what he was. He was nothing more than a sort of a mountain howitzer, likely, because they had no heavy artillery in those days. Suffice it, then, that Heloise lived with her uncle the howitzer and was happy. She spent the most of her childhood in the convent of Argenteuil\u2014never heard of Argenteuil before, but suppose there was really such a place. She then returned to her uncle, the old gun, or son of a gun, as the case may be, and he taught her to write and speak Latin, which was the language of literature and polite society at that period.Just at this time, Pierre Abelard, who had already made himself widely famous as a rhetorician, came to found a school of rhetoric in Paris. The originality of his principles, his eloquence, and his great physical strength and beauty created a profound sensation. He saw Heloise, and was captivated by her blooming youth, her beauty, and her charming disposition. He wrote to her; she answered. He wrote again; she answered again. He was now in love. He longed to know her\u2014to speak to her face to face.His school was near Fulbert's house. He asked Fulbert to allow him to call. The good old swivel saw here a rare opportunity: his niece, whom he so much loved, would absorb knowledge from this man, and it would not cost him a cent. Such was Fulbert\u2014penurious.Fulbert's first name is not mentioned by any author, which is unfortunate. However, George W. Fulbert will answer for him as well as any other. We will let him go at that. He asked Abelard to teach her.Abelard was glad enough of the opportunity. He came often and staid long. A letter of his shows in its very first sentence that he came under that friendly roof like a cold-hearted villain as he was, with the deliberate intention of debauching a confiding, innocent girl. This is the letter:\"I cannot cease to be astonished at the simplicity of Fulbert; I was as much surprised as if he had placed a lamb in the power of a hungry wolf. Heloise and I, under pretext of study, gave ourselves up wholly to love, and the solitude that love seeks our studies procured for us. Books were open before us, but we spoke oftener of love than philosophy, and kisses came more readily from our lips than words.\"And so, exulting over an honorable confidence which to his degraded instinct was a ludicrous \"simplicity,\" this unmanly Abelard seduced the niece of the man whose guest he was. Paris found it out. Fulbert was told of it\u2014told often\u2014but refused to believe it. He could not comprehend how a man could be so depraved as to use the sacred protection and security of hospitality as a means for the commission of such a crime as that. But when he heard the rowdies in the streets singing the love-songs of Abelard to Heloise, the case was too plain\u2014love-songs come not properly within the teachings of rhetoric and philosophy.He drove Abelard from his house. Abelard returned secretly and carried Heloise away to Palais, in Brittany, his native country. Here, shortly afterward, she bore a son, who, from his rare beauty, was surnamed Astrolabe\u2014William G. The girl's flight enraged Fulbert, and he longed for vengeance, but feared to strike lest retaliation visit Heloise\u2014for he still loved her tenderly. At length Abelard offered to marry Heloise\u2014but on a shameful condition: that the marriage should be kept secret from the world, to the end that (while her good name remained a wreck, as before,) his priestly reputation might be kept untarnished. It was like that miscreant. Fulbert saw his opportunity and consented. He would see the parties married, and then violate the confidence of the man who had taught him that trick; he would divulge the secret and so remove somewhat of the obloquy that attached to his niece's fame. But the niece suspected his scheme. She refused the marriage at first; she said Fulbert would betray the secret to save her, and besides, she did not wish to drag down a lover who was so gifted, so honored by the world, and who had such a splendid career before him. It was noble, self-sacrificing love, and characteristic of the pure-souled Heloise, but it was not good sense.But she was overruled, and the private marriage took place. Now for Fulbert! The heart so wounded should be healed at last; the proud spirit so tortured should find rest again; the humbled head should be lifted up once more. He proclaimed the marriage in the high places of the city and rejoiced that dishonor had departed from his house. But lo! Abelard denied the marriage! Heloise denied it! The people, knowing the former circumstances, might have believed Fulbert had only Abelard denied it, but when the person chiefly interested\u2014the girl herself\u2014denied it, they laughed, despairing Fulbert to scorn.The poor canon of the cathedral of Paris was spiked again. The last hope of repairing the wrong that had been done his house was gone. What next? Human nature suggested revenge. He compassed it. The historian says:\"Ruffians, hired by Fulbert, fell upon Abelard by night, and inflicted upon him a terrible and nameless mutilation.\"I am seeking the last resting place of those \"ruffians.\" When I find it I shall shed some tears on it, and stack up some bouquets and immortelles, and cart away from it some gravel whereby to remember that howsoever blotted by crime their lives may have been, these ruffians did one just deed, at any rate, albeit it was not warranted by the strict letter of the law.Heloise entered a convent and gave good-bye to the world and its pleasures for all time. For twelve years she never heard of Abelard\u2014never even heard his name mentioned. She had become prioress of Argenteuil and led a life of complete seclusion. She happened one day to see a letter written by him, in which he narrated his own history. She cried over it and wrote him. He answered, addressing her as his \"sister in Christ.\" They continued to correspond, she in the unweighed language of unwavering affection, he in the chilly phraseology of the polished rhetorician. She poured out her heart in passionate, disjointed sentences; he replied with finished essays, divided deliberately into heads and sub-heads, premises and argument. She showered upon him the tenderest epithets that love could devise, he addressed her from the North Pole of his frozen heart as the \"Spouse of Christ!\" The abandoned villain!On account of her too easy government of her nuns, some disreputable irregularities were discovered among them, and the Abbot of St. Denis broke up her establishment. Abelard was the official head of the monastery of St. Gildas de Ruys, at that time, and when he heard of her homeless condition a sentiment of pity was aroused in his breast (it is a wonder the unfamiliar emotion did not blow his head off,) and he placed her and her troop in the little oratory of the Paraclete, a religious establishment which he had founded. She had many privations and sufferings to undergo at first, but her worth and her gentle disposition won influential friends for her, and she built up a wealthy and flourishing nunnery. She became a great favorite with the heads of the church, and also the people, though she seldom appeared in public. She rapidly advanced in esteem, in good report, and in usefulness, and Abelard as rapidly lost ground. The Pope so honored her that he made her the head of her order. Abelard, a man of splendid talents, and ranking as the first debater of his time, became timid, irresolute, and distrustful of his powers. He only needed a great misfortune to topple him from the high position he held in the world of intellectual excellence, and it came. Urged by kings and princes to meet the subtle St. Bernard in debate and crush him, he stood up in the presence of a royal and illustrious assemblage, and when his antagonist had finished he looked about him and stammered a commencement; but his courage failed him, the cunning of his tongue was gone: with his speech unspoken, he trembled and sat down, a disgraced and vanquished champion.He died a nobody, and was buried at Cluny, A.D., 1144. They removed his body to the Paraclete afterward, and when Heloise died, twenty years later, they buried her with him, in accordance with her last wish. He died at the ripe age of 64, and she at 63. After the bodies had remained entombed three hundred years, they were removed once more. They were removed again in 1800, and finally, seventeen years afterward, they were taken up and transferred to Pere la Chaise, where they will remain in peace and quiet until it comes time for them to get up and move again.History is silent concerning the last acts of the mountain howitzer. Let the world say what it will about him, I, at least, shall always respect the memory and sorrow for the abused trust and the broken heart and the troubled spirit of the old smooth-bore. Rest and repose be his!Such is the story of Abelard and Heloise. Such is the history that Lamartine has shed such cataracts of tears over. But that man never could come within the influence of a subject in the least pathetic without overflowing his banks. He ought to be dammed\u2014or leveed, I should more properly say. Such is the history\u2014not as it is usually told, but as it is when stripped of the nauseous sentimentality that would enshrine for our loving worship a dastardly seducer like Pierre Abelard. I have not a word to say against the misused, faithful girl, and would not withhold from her grave a single one of those simple tributes which blighted youths and maidens offer to her memory, but I am sorry enough that I have not time and opportunity to write four or five volumes of my opinion of her friend the founder of the Parachute, or the Paraclete, or whatever it was.The tons of sentiment I have wasted on that unprincipled humbug in my ignorance! I shall throttle down my emotions hereafter, about this sort of people, until I have read them up and know whether they are entitled to any tearful attentions or not. I wish I had my immortelles back, now, and that bunch of radishes."}, {"userName": "Ron", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1256262-ron", "userReview": "\u201cTravel is fatal to bigotry and prejudice and narrow-mindedness.\u201dIn 1867 young Samuel Clemens joined one of the first cruises for an extended voyage from New York City to the Holy Land.

The excursion is advertised to be full of excitement and adventure in foreign lands of great historical importance, but as Twain journeys these lands, he makes no hesitation to comment on the contrast between the inflated tales of travel guides and history books and the less exciting, borderline boring reality. The Innocents Abroad certainly has that \u201cclassics\u201d vibe, with its excessive and often times ostentatious vocabulary to describe simple ideas. Right in the preface when he used the phrase \u201cthat impressive incomprehensibility which is so proper to works of that kind\u201d, I sighed, knowing this was going to be a long read. Why did writers of the past try SO hard to sound educated and formal? This is supposed to be a diary/journal, so I don\u2019t understand the effort to write so excessively. Of course, I am aware that this was the common style of writing in Twain\u2019s time and the 1800s in general, but as I\u2019ve already stated, my review is not academic, but composed of personal thoughts and attitudes. I don\u2019t feel compelled to praise Twin simply because he is renowned. On that note, I should mention that Twain\u2019s sense of \u201chumour\u201d, which he is so praised for, is sometimes just blatant racism.I am not surprised by this, of course, as Twain was simply a man of his time. But it does make me wonder, where does all that arrogance and self-importance come from? What made Twain and his crew not able to comprehend that the man on the shoreline in France was not ignorant in his own language, but that Twain\u2019s own crew could simply not speak French properly. And what made him say at one point in the book \u201cIt does amaze me sometimes just how intelligent we are\u201d.....?? Not to mention, he completely dismisses foreign cultures as being savage and barbarous, despite not being able to speak with their people or understand their language. How does he know that the Turkish Sultan is not more wise than himself, when he has never properly communicated with him? But no, the Sultan looks like a barbarian, so he must be one. Is this how stupid people were in the 1800s? Sheesh.It\u2019s especially ironic to see this attitude from Twain when he states himself that part of the reason they were touring the world was to learn. I wonder what the great Mark Twain would think today if he saw that America\u2019s demographic s are no longer as vanilla-white and that all the cultures he dismissed as being \u201cbarbarous\u201d are now thriving in his own country. History has its ironies.It was interesting to me, however, to see this book from a historical point of view. The fact that a journey around the Eastern world could cost a mere thousand dollars is intriguing, when the same sum today could just barely cover a short trip to Europe. Travellers nowadays no longer have to wait weeks to arrive to their destinations, or suffer sea-sickness, or any lack of soap in foreign countries. There were a few other details here and there interested me, like the fact that journal-writing was so common in those days where taking a selfie would be more practiced today and so on and so forth.I feel compelled, on a final note, to give Twain some credit for his honesty. I'm sure his original readers would have appreciated it as I did. He describes places as he sees them and does not feel inclined to describe them in inflated terms, as the travel guides of his day often did. When he says that the people travelling with him would not describe the Holy land as they saw it, small and crowded, but would describe it as they had read about it and what the popular opinion of it was, I imagine it would have been at least a little controversial. Hats off for honesty.All in all, The Innocents Abroad was a long book; boring, like most classics are.

He also captures that sense of the awe of the shear weight that centuries of history can give a place, so hard to describe but so palpable once you've experienced it.It's a lovely read to get you to remember that's not all about the US, to carry you back to a different time, and most of all to hang out with Twain, who is always worth the price of admission."}, {"userName": "Rebekah", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39988509-rebekah", "userReview": "In this book Mark Twain proceeds to make fun of every people group imaginable, including Americans, on a long cruise through Spain, Italy, Rome, Greece, France, and Jerusalem. And he does an excellent job of it. ;) This book can be a bit boring in parts, but the ones patient enough to wade through lengthy descriptions of scenery and people will be richly rewarded. Mark Twain scatters priceless gems throughout the book which will not only bring a smile to your face, and even cause you to burst out laughing, but also make you infinitely glad you decided to read it.I'll end this review with a warning: this book has to be read with a clear head and alert brain. You have to be ready to understand the subtle layers he puts in your path as well as his dry, sarcastic humor."}, {"userName": "Chris Selin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3221231-chris-selin", "userReview": "For being a non-fiction work on traveling to Europe, Africa and the Holy Lands all the way back in 1867, this book was incredibly dull. It started out interesting, but ended up being nothing but Twain crabbing about everything and digressing about unrelated moments in his life. Granted, sections of the book did have me googling locations and historical figures to gain more knowledge, so I guess the fact that I learned and revisited subjects learned in the past allows this book a few redeeming qualities. Twain was funny on a couple pages and made several goods points on others, but, honestly, what a curmudgeon.Take it for what it is. Interesting to see how much has changed in world travel and Europe since 1867, and how much hasn't changed in the Holy Lands since time began."}, {"userName": "Demetrius Rogers", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5155177-demetrius-rogers", "userReview": "Twain, here, is long winded. LONG winded. But, his use of language is nearly perfect. And, for that reason, I enjoyed it in spite of its exasperating length. Oh, and the moments of humor were excellent. I've read three Twain books now (Tom Sawyer, Life on the Mississippi, and now this one) and each made me LOL. This guy was FUNNY and bristling with wit. I love how he can have such a high regard for proper English, yet employ such down-home American diction. Definitely becoming one of my favorite authors. Sure, you read him in junior high and high school, but to appreciate what he does I think you need to be a little older. This was the case for me anyhow. Can't wait to make it into Huck Finn. To have Twain and Lincoln for dinner, oh, that would be loads of fun!"}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2201886-mike", "userReview": "Some of Twain's best writing. Planned and executed as a money-raising venture, but probably not as appreciated as it should be.Update August 2010 -I guess I should have written more about this book when I first entered it in my GR list. I found this book to be funny, witty (not the same), and very finely crafted. Mr. Clemens did a lot of things to earn money (this was one), but his ability as an author could turn any hum-drum yarn into a cornucopia of vivid images and opinion.Like most of his books, not enough are read today. But luckily, they are available to inquisitive readers. Pick it up and enjoy yourself!"}], "description": "The Innocents Abroad is one of the most prominent and influential travel books ever written about Europe and the Holy Land.", "title": "The Innocents Abroad", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2443.The_Innocents_Abroad", "average": 3.86, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388280342l/2443.jpg", "reviews": 801, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1244.Mark_Twain", "name": "Mark Twain"}], "type": ["Travel", "Classics", "Nonfiction", "Humor"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2443.The_Innocents_Abroad", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2444.The_Innocents_Abroad", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/837986.The_Innocents_Abroad", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15712112-the-innocents-abroad", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25337380-the-innocents-abroad", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13030443-the-innocents-abroad", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/864381.The_Innocents_Abroad", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18995861-the-innocents-abroad", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/530332.The_Innocents_Abroad", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14991840-the-innocents-abroad", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2956.The_Adventures_of_Huckleberry_Finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24583.The_Adventures_of_Tom_Sawyer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62446.The_Prince_and_the_Pauper", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/162898.A_Connecticut_Yankee_in_King_Arthur_s_Court", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24580.The_Adventures_of_Tom_Sawyer_Adventures_of_Huckleberry_Finn"]}
