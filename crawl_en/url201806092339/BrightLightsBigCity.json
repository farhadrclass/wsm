This, or Bret Easton Ellis's literary debut, \"Less Than Zero\"? These two novels are comparable because they crystallized the 80's with style to spare. They both have that quality that makes a reader almost fanatically impatient for their next written work.My opinion is that THIS ONE gets top prize. (Although Ellis's \"Rules of Attraction\" is better than both of these). The protagonist gets some help from the ever-elusive second person narrator treatment... a fantastic writing feat! For you are the guy, YOU, and are trapped in your own particular time & space (obviously conveying the very way he feels trapped, just like the reader becomes trapped inside the narrative). This quality makes it especially endearing.It's important & one true page turner on top of it!"}, {"userName": "Glenn Russell", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23385697-glenn-russell", "userReview": "FINAL REVIEW\u201cYour brain at this moment is composed of brigades of tiny Bolivian soldiers. They are tired and muddy from their long march through the night. There are holes in their boots and they are hungry. They need to be fed. The need the Bolivian Marching Powder.\u201d Quote from the opening scene of this 1984 Jay McInerney novel told in cool, hip, drug-hyped second person. But, alas, this is merely the surface. Each time I read this book, I comprehend more clearly how the words on every page have sharp razor-like edges that cut into the heart of the narrator. However, to say specifically why this is so would be to say too much since the more complete story of what the narrator is going through is not disclosed until the closing chapters.Below are my comments coupled with one-line snappers from the novel\u2019s main character, a 24-year old coke-snorting would-be writer working as a fact-checker for a New Yorker-like magazine and living in a downtown apartment by himself after Amanda, his fashion model wife, called telling him she isn\u2019t coming back and he will be hearing from her lawyer to settle the divorce:\u201cThe girl with the shaved head has a scar tattooed on her scalp. It looks like a long, sutured gash. You tell her it is very realistic. She takes this as a compliment and thanks you. You meant as opposed to romantic. \u201cI could use one of those right over my heart,\u201d you say.\u201d ---------- The narrator\u2019s words foreshadow how he really isn\u2019t after the thrills of the hip scene but something emotionally deeper and much more personal. I can appreciate how many dislike the novel and the whining, distressed voice of the narrator since, in many respects, his emotional turmoil is similar to that other sensitive, distraught, whining 16-year old back in the late 1940s \u2013 Holden Caulfield in J. D. Salinger\u2019s classic. \u201cIt\u2019s 10:58. You\u2019ve worn out the line about the subway breaking down. Maybe tell Clara you stopped to take a free look at Kinky Karla and got bitten by her snake.\u201d --------- Clara is the narrator\u2019s boss at the fact finding department; Kinky Karla and her snake one of the thrills the old street hawkers hawk out on the street. Both of these worlds \u2013 the clock-driven, drab, humdrum office and the blaring girls-girls--girls sleaze \u2013 are exactly what the narrator in his current anguished state does not need.\u201cThere was a cartoon you used to watch with a time-traveling turtle and a benevolent wizard. The turtle would journey back to say, the French revolution, inevitably getting in way over his head. At the last minute, when he was stretched out under the guillotine, he would cry out, \u201cHelp, Mr. Wizard!\u201d And the wizard, on the other end of the time warp, would wave his wand and rescue the hapless turtle.\u201d ---------- Ha! A common wish, particularly among young adults, to be saved from the need to do a 9-5 pressure-cooker job. All of my education for this? Mr. Wizard, please get me the hell out of here! Sorry, life isn\u2019t a cartoon \u2013 you will have to find your own way out. \u201cYou insert another piece of paper, again you type the date. At the left margin you type, \u201cDear Amanda,\u201d but when you look at the paper it reads, \u201cDead Amanda.\u201d Screw this. You are not going to commit any great literature tonight.\u201d ---------- So telling. Writing fiction nearly always requires an emotional distance; when one is undergoing extreme personal upset, such as our novel\u2019s narrator, it is next to impossible to move past drafting the first paragraph. \u201cWade saunters in and stops in front of your desk. He looks at you and clicks his tongue. \u201cWhat kind of flowers do you want on your grave? I already have the epitaph: He didn\u2019t face facts.\u201d -------- This exchange after the narrator, by his own admission, completely screwed up in performing his job. His refusal to face and deal with his life beyond the office gives an ironic twist to 'He didn\u2019t face facts'. \u201cWhen you first came to the city you spent a night here with Amanda. You have friends to stay with but you wanted to spend that first night at the Plaza. . . . Your tenth-floor room was tiny and overlooked an airshaft; though you could not see the city out the window, you believed that it was spread out at your feet. The limousines around the entrances seemed like carriages, and you felt that someday one would wait for you. Today they put you in mind of carrion birds, and you cannot believe your dreams were so shallow. ---------- Such is the truth of the city: if you have money and are on the rise, the Big Apple is a dream come true; if you are penniless and on the skids, it quickly turns into a cold, cruel deathtrap.This was Jay McInerney\u2019s first novel. He went on to write a half a dozen more, but none having nearly the hype and fame as this one. Curiously, from what I gather, Jay has spent much of the last thirty years attempting to separate his personal identity from the identity of this novel\u2019s narrator. Such is the power of literature."}, {"userName": "Orsodimondo", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10490224-orsodimondo", "userReview": "IL GIORNO COME SEMPRE SAR\u00c0Tu non sei esattamente il tipo di persona che ci si aspetterebbe di vedere in un posto come questo a quest\u2019ora del mattino.Questo \u00e8 l\u2019incipit, comincia proprio cos\u00ec.Bright Lights, Big City \u2013 Le mille luci di New York.E perch\u00e9 lui e il posto e l\u2019ora del giorno non si accordano?Perch\u00e9 a quell\u2019ora, le 4 del mattino, lui dovrebbe essere a casa a dormire, la mattina dopo deve andare al lavoro. Sar\u00e0 uno straccio per aver passato la notte in piedi. Averla passata sniffando coca boliviana. Al punto da non sapere dove si trova. Infatti, il \u201cposto\u201d a lui \u00e8 poco chiaro: sa per certo che \u00e8 un locale notturno, chiamiamolo nightclub, ma potrebbe essere l\u2019Heartbreak, oppure il Lizard Lounge. La coca boliviana e l\u2019alcol, ingeriti in quantit\u00e0 allegre, gli annebbiano il cervello, e quindi, non \u00e8 ben sicuro di sapere dove si trova.Sa per\u00f2 che \u00e8 appoggiato a un pilastro, che potrebbe non essere portante ma di sicuro \u00e8 importante per lui perch\u00e9 se non ci fosse appoggiato sarebbe sul pavimento - e sta parlando con una ragazza che ha la testa rasata a zero e che forse gli ha detto come si chiama ma certo lui non se lo ricorda.Michael J. Fox, inadatto al ruolo, miscasted, viene battezzato Jamie.Chi \u00e8 lui?\u00c8 quello che in Italia chiameremmo un giovane aspirante scrittore. Invece, in US lo chiamerebbero solo aspirante scrittore, senza giovane, perch\u00e9 avendo superato i 25 anni, non ha pi\u00f9 diritto a questo appellativo.Non sappiamo come si chiama, il suo nome non compare mai, \u00e8 l\u2019unico che rimane ignoto, \u00e8 un protagonista cos\u00ec depresso da non avere neanche un nome. lavora in un importante rivista (con chiaro riferimento al New Yorker) al reparto fact checking (verifica dei fatti), uno di quei lavori che in Italia non esistono, e non si pensa neppure ad avviarli, uno di quei lavori fondamentali ma per nulla scintillanti. E s\u00ec, gli piace scrivere, e ancor pi\u00f9 gli piacerebbe pubblicare, magari una raccolta di racconti, cominciando da uno qui e uno l\u00e0 su qualche rivista, come di solito si inizia la carriera di scrittore da quelle parti.Siamo all\u2019inizio degli anni Ottanta (il romanzo \u00e8 uscito nel 1984) e questo \u00e8 importante: perch\u00e9 queste pagine rappresentano la quintessenza di quel periodo, ne sono figlie, e al contempo, lo illuminano, lo spiegano, lo raccontano. E anche negli anni dell\u2019edonismo reaganiano, degli yuppie, dell\u2019economia che andava a gonfie vele, e tutto sembrava in crescita, quando finalmente l\u2019uomo bianco occidentale, forse per la prima volta, si trovava tra le mani una vita che sembra senza punti negativi, anche in quel momento, dietro la copertina luccicante, scostando il velo\u2026Kiefer Sutherland \u00e8 l\u2019amico Tad che procura la cocaina al protagonista.Come mai questo protagonista \u00e8 cos\u00ec depresso da non avere neanche un nome?Perch\u00e9 la sua bellissima moglie l\u2019ha appena lasciato. Lei \u00e8 una modella, \u00e8 andata a Parigi per sfilare, lo ha chiamato da l\u00ec per dirgli \u201cnon torno, rimango qui, tra noi \u00e8 finita, grazie di tutto, bye bye\u201d. Prima di partire per Parigi, Amanda, ha prestato ils uo viso come calco per un manichino: \u00e8 stata un\u2019ora e mezza col viso coperto da una maschera di lattice respirando attraverso due cannucce infilate nelle narici.E adesso che \u00e8 stato liquidato con una semplice breve telefonata, lui la vede in giro per la citt\u00e0, dietro le vetrine di Bloomingdale, nei manichinie sposti.E cos\u00ec, il nostro protagonista fatica a metabolizzare questo abbandono, non riesce a tenere la testa su quello che fa, si lascia andare, sniffa, beve, tira tardi, combina casini sul lavoro, che infatti finir\u00e0 col perdere, sar\u00e0 licenziato.Come se non bastasse c\u2019\u00e8 che sua madre \u00e8 morta da un anno di cancro, e le cose fra loro hanno cominciato ad andare meglio solo poco prima che lei morisse.Il film \u00e8 del 1988, diretto da James Bridges, che ne ha fatti di migliori.Ma perch\u00e9 questo protagonista cos\u00ec depresso da non avere neanche un nome si esprime con la seconda persona, si rivolge a se stesso?Beh, un motivo direi che \u00e8 nella novit\u00e0 della cosa: narrare attraverso il \u2018tu\u2019 nel 1984 era pratica meno nota di ora \u2013 qualcuno direbbe che forse era la prima volta che si faceva, ma ho dubbi in proposito. In ogni caso, era un approccio letterario insolito. Spiazzante.Nel caso di questo bel romanzo perfettamente giustificato secondo me, davvero giustificato, non certo solo un mero esercizio stilistico: perch\u00e9 questo protagonista cos\u00ec depresso da non avere neanche un nome per la maggior parte della storia \u00e8 come se fosse doppio, si guarda da fuori, nona pprova quello che fa, e solo nel finale, nel bel capitolo che chiude il libro, si riappacifica con se stesso inq uello che si pu\u00f2 definire una possibilit\u00e0 di happy ending.Perch\u00e9 se fino all\u2019ultimo capitolo il viaggio \u00e8 sembrato senza speranza, marchiato dal fallimento, adesso si comincia ad avvertire l\u2019inizio, o almeno il desiderio di una ribellione, si comincia a intuire una luce in fondo al tunnel.Magari solo questa:il profumo del pane ti avvolge come una pioggerella leggera. Inali profondamente, ti riempi i polmoni. Ti vengono le lacrime agli occhi, e provi una tale sensazione di tenerezza e piet\u00e0 che sei costretto ad attaccarti a un lampione\u2026 Il primo boccone ti si ferma in gola e ti fa quasi vomitare. Dovrai cercare di andar piano. Dovrai imparare tutto daccapo.Dianne Wiest \u00e8 la madre.Il \u2018tu\u2019 \u00e8 un martello che colpisce rigo dopo rigo (o meglio, visto che la coca \u00e8 cos\u00ec centrale in questa storia, meglio usare il femminile riga), pagina dopo pagina: incalza, spinge, scandisce secco e bruciante.La prima luce del mattino disegna contro il cielo i grattacieli del World Trade Center sulla punta dell\u2019isola.Da noi Bright Lights, Big City \u00e8 arrivato nel 1986 pubblicato da Bompiani. Prima di Meno di zero e Ballo di famiglia. E qui da noi si cominci\u00f2 a parlare di minimalismo come mai prima. Al punto da recuperare Carver, che da maestro di alcuni di questi, editorialmente parlando in Italia divent\u00f2 quasi un loro discepolo.

Senza essere datato: sia i libri di Pier che questo esordio di Jay hanno conservato il loro valore letterario evitando di restare inchiodati al loro periodo storico (di costume).PSDel film non vale la pena parlare, mediocre sotto qualsiasi punto di vista.Richard Estes: Booths. 1967"}, {"userName": "Jonathan Ashleigh", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33737465-jonathan-ashleigh", "userReview": "This book is one I believe everyone should read.

You were intrigued, understandably. Point of view in fiction has always been an area of interest, and you might be described as a sucker for narrative gimmicks.While preparing for a trip to Manhattan, you entertained romantic fantasies of reading a novel set in New York during your stay. You forgot, as you always do, that you never manage to read while traveling, and that at best, you might get through a few chapters on the plane before falling asleep. You brought an optimistic two novels and didn't even open them, so it wasn't until after your return that you finally started BRIGHT LIGHTS, BIG CITY.The second-person narration was strange at first. You kept stopping to stare at that word and analyze how it made you feel to be cast in the role of a coke-fueled, miserable young guy in early '80s New York. But these days you always focus too much on the words at the beginning of a book. When the writing is good -- and in this case it is -- you get pulled into the story soon enough.Still, even as you were enjoying the breakneck ride through nightclub debauchery and the contrasting sobriety of a respected magazine's Department of Factual Verification, you did keep thinking about the effect. Were you drawn closer to the narrator and his muddled thoughts because the novel said that he was you? Or were you kept at a greater distance by a character in denial who refused to call himself \"I\"?

Apparently, the novel began its life as a short story Jay McInerney published in a literary magazine, and which he later expanded into a full novel.Aside from the neat narrative trick, there is not much that one can say about the contents of the novel itself. The anonymous narrator, obviously based on McInerey himself, spends his days working at the department of Factual Verification for a magazine in New York, and his nights partying at the local clubs. One of the first things which strikes the contemporary reader is how amusingly dated the book is. For obvious reasons, no one uses a computer; the narrator and others do their job the old way, finding information in actual records and via telephone calls to various sources. Despite little evidence of the narrator doing much actual work requiring actual skill, he somehow manages to live in Manhattan, go to parties and get high on cocaine most of the time.There is little to say about the narrator - although unhappy, he remains resigned throughout most of the novel. Despite wanting to work at the fiction department, he never once tries producing any actual fiction; although he feels alienated and misses his former wife, there is little to suggest that he is actually willing or even capable of pursuing a real relationship with anyone. The few biographical snippets which aim to give us more insight into the narrator's character - a look at the early days of his marriage, a visit by his brother - ultimately turn out to not be enough to arouse any interest in someone who is thoroughly uninteresting, even if he is \"you\". It does not help that the background characters are entirely forgettable - including the narrator's wife, and his friend and mentor, Tad Allagash, about whom we learn little more than his name. Ultimately, there is little reason to care about anything that happens in the novel as the narrator does not care very much either, and in the end this was exactly my reaction: I did not care at all.This is not a terrible book, but it's a period piece through and through. There are a few good lines throughout the text (my favorite being \"You are a republic of voices tonight. Unfortunately, that republic is Italy.\"), but Jay McInerney is no Bret Easton Ellis, and Bright Lights, Big City is not Less Than Zero and definitely not American Psycho, both of which feature similar themes but are much better books."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/184521-john", "userReview": "You decide to read this book because it was written in the second person. This is interesting to you. You've never read a book written in that manner, at least you can't remember if you have. This seems like a pretentious idea to you, but you are curious. You like the book more than you expected to. It isn't all that dated. Sure, lots of NYC landmarks have changed, but the gist is still the same. You identify with the main character. You decide that if you lived in NYC in 1984, this would probably have been your life. You ignore the fact that dance clubs and cocaine still exist, and you could actually choose this life if you wanted but you actively avoid it.McInerney, you realize, actually wrote that book that every 20 or 30 something guy with a liberal arts degree who spends their time wandering the city imagines they are constantly on the verge of writing. And it turned out pretty good. You are a little jealous. Except for the dialogue. Once again, it glares. You wonder if this is the most common problem with writing. Bad dialogue. People saying too much. Too much information in what would be a briefer conversation. Fictional people always seem to have too many words to say.

To which I say, does anyone need a justification for ennui? Plus, he crucially drops the ball on a couple of scenes near the end. More specifically, all the important scenes toward the end are very much hit or miss. His failed hookup with the angelic but still believable Megan was great, as was the scene at the very end with the bread. But the scene where he runs into the wife who abandoned him? Suddenly we have lines like \"'How's it going?' You start to laugh. She laughs too. You slap your thigh. She wants to know how it's going. A very funny question. Hilarious. Amanda is a riot. You are laughing so hard that you choke . . . You are laughing. People are pounding your back. It's funny. People are funny. Everything's so funny you could die laughing.\" Is it a commentary on the insipidness of unrequited obsession? Maybe, but that doesn't make me like it. Despite all that, though, it's a fundamentally good book, or so I think.

Overall there are some solid parts, this one particularly:\u201cBut what you are left with is a premonition of the way your life will fade behind you, like a book you have read too quickly, leaving a dwindling trail of images and emotions, until all you can remember is a name.\u201dBut then there are some lackluster scenes when it tried to be emotional but didn\u2019t do enough, also the second-person point of view became a little disconcerting after some time. Still, it was quite fun. The book is at its best when it\u2019s about the bright lights, enjoyment, and the city of New York. The ending left a little to be desired but it wasn\u2019t too bad either. Let me then dwell on the predominant issue that this book injected into my thoughts.Sensuality vs. Intellectualism. There are few things in this world that truly interest people. Mainly, they have to do with the senses. Rarely are people excited by the prospect of philosophy or intellectual stimulation. They associate more with the aesthetic; hence art is never devoid of its audience. People are sexual, gluttonous, musical, even fragrance is highly sought after. These qualities define people; it gives them their fleeting share of happiness. It gives them pleasure. But pleasure is subjective to what pleases one, and pleasure in the humanistic sense is delved in the stimulation of the senses. It leads one to question humanity\u2019s major adjective, intellectual or sensual? Based on the aforementioned, I would conclude the latter. For what is the purpose of intellectual endeavors? An education is but the prerequisite for work. Nobody goes to the university to pursue knowledge, people pursue degrees. Their goal is to pass their requirements and find decent work. And in work, people think, exercise their minds in order to receive monetary compensation. Compensation which will be used for food, shelter, clothing, electricity, travel. One can argue that these are necessary for one\u2019s survival, that one uses the intellect to survive. But things that we say sustain one\u2019s survival are delved into the senses more than is necessary. So then, is intellect nothing but a means to an end? If the purpose of intellect is to lead us to a pleasurable sensual life, then should intellectual growth be pursued? Do we need to enhance the means? Wouldn\u2019t a direct pursuit of the end be more efficient? If one follows this line of thinking, then seeking a life of sensual pleasure is the obvious choice to follow. One does not need an education to do that. But then we tackle humanity\u2019s great flaw: greed. If intellect is the means to the sensual, then the greater the intellect the greater the sensual pleasure accessible. People want greater pleasure, they strive for intellect growth. Alas, there\u2019s a catch. There\u2019s a ledge at the end, a deep cliff of no return where a dark chasm awaits. When one proceeds past a certain point in the intellectual sphere, one becomes aware of the said circumstances. With awareness comes the numbing of the senses, the sensual. A mist engulfing one and suppressing feeling appears. Suddenly, the sensual is nothing but a distraction. A fascination of all things metaphysical gives reality the quality of a dream. One starts asking questions, and with questions come, not answers, but more questions. An awakening to why, what, who, where and for that, the sensual has no answer. But the intellect tells one that it is futile, that the answer doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s asking the question that tells you you\u2019re awake, that the sensual is but a dream of those asleep. If there is something that can tip the scales, that can show that humanity is more intellectual than sensual, it\u2019s one thing. Curiosity. The need to know. Why?"}, {"userName": "Sandra", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11916501-sandra", "userReview": "Qualche domenica fa, nell\u2019inserto del Corriere della Sera sulla lettura c\u2019era un\u2019intervista a tale Gary Fisketjon, editor newyorkese scopritore di talenti come Cormac Mc Carthy ed anche di Jay Mc Inerney.

I think it is good to read out of my comfort zone, though this is not the first book of this kind (drug-addled entitled and oblivious individuals in their twenties running around a city) which I have read. Less Than Zero was better but a beast of a differnet nature as well, so I am being totally unfair in comparing the two. But I simply have to compare McInerney and Ellis. They fed off of eachother, with Ellis leaning towards horror and McInerney towards something which more readers will be able to relate to. McInerney's main character in this book is more human than any character I have so far read created by Ellis. I was able to relate to this book on nearly every level, excluding the drugs. I feel the cocaine usage was a little too high but who am I to say. Maybe this extravagance, if you will, was intentional. Did everyone in the 80's who lived in a city use cocaine? I doubt it. Most notably, Bright Lights, Big City is written in second person and this did contribute towards my being bale to relate to the character. The narrative style worked very well and I find myself drawn to more modern and post-modern fiction that employs it. The writing is witty and honest and anyone who has ever lost someone, whether through death or through a relationship while young, will be able to sympathize with the main character. The sympathy I felt and my rooting for the character made this a positive read. The book is about the curveballs life throws at you and those moments when you realize you can handle more than you first thought possible. Of course, McInerney seems to be saying that it is handled best with cocaine balzing through your blood stream but I can excuse this. The book began with a wonderful biting humor, which never again quite reached the funny zenith I wanted it to later in the book. It was contemplative and the main character destructive, in an accepted-by-the-city and his peers kind of way. I quite liked the ending, though I can imagine some readers wanting more. My favorite chapter was the second(?), involving the main character's job as a fact checker.

He had attached a yellow Post-It saying he thought I might enjoy it since it takes place in both New York and Paris (sort of). I got no personal reading done in Paris, and this book, despite being only 230 something pages, has been on my shelf since this summer until I got to it this fall. There must have been a cosmic source making me wait to read it, since I believe books sometimes know when we need the stories inside them. \"Bright Lights Big City\" couldn't have come at a better time for me.The novel is best known for it's use of second person narration, but this took little to no adaptation for me. The narrator is disillusioned by everything in his life, from his once kind-of-cool magazine job, to living in the \"best city in the world,\" and his young model wife who has since left him for a modeling career in gay Paris. The story opens to him high on cocaine, talking to a woman with a shaved head in a club who he may or may not want to have sex with if by any chance she happens to be interested, which he quickly determines she is not and ends up stumbling home at dawn, the New York city streets his only backdrop. Once I got over my momentary shock that this was one of my father's favorite novels, I was able to see the true beauty of what I was reading.There's a reason this story has been at the tip of reader's tongues for over twenty years. Despite its age it remains relevant, touching, and laugh out loud funny. I was \"that girl\" laughing aloud on the SI Ferry on more than one occasion.Perhaps it was my ability to identify with being a young twenty something struggling for a professional and personal identity in New York City. The city has an odd way of giving you value, especially as a young person. Even more as a writer, someone who struggles for more but can't quite determine how to get it. The narrator is this person. Hence what I said about \"good timing.\"Yet even I'll admit the same old young person searching for themselves story can get old and played out. And just when you think McInerney's bold writing style is the reason his run of the mill coming of age has remained in such strong focus, the story turns into something so much deeper, and much more touching by using family to reach through all the bull shit we experience when we think we've lost ourselves.One of my favorite books I've ever read, and I think it saved me at a time when I was beginning to wonder what I WAS going to do with myself after all."}, {"userName": "Silvia Sirea", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33484599-silvia-sirea", "userReview": "Frenesia e inadeguatezza sono le prime parole che mi vengono in mente se penso a questo romanzo.Ci si ritrova, fin da subito, catapultati nella vita della New York degli anni ottanta tra grattacieli, taxi, luci e discoteche.

I wanted to dislike it, to put it in the same category as American Psycho and move on. But I ended up liking the book. I liked it a lot, actually. My main impressions were: (1) This is not the best book I'll ever read, but it's better than 95 percent of the books I pick up. The plot is very undeveloped, but the story hangs together extremely well. A series of collages tells you what you need to know without connecting the dots for you. This is uncommon in novels.(2) The second-person narrative is not a gimmick. The same book could not have been written in another voice. (3) The shape and feel of the prose distinguish this novel from others ostensibly like it (i.e., novels about hedonism in 1980s New York). After reading a sentence, my eyes would often retrace it and then connect it to the sentences before and after it. The flow was perfect. Sometimes I'd silently repeat a sentence or two, just to hear the sound again. (I also can't help but do this when I read Palahniuk, even though I don't particularly like his style and all I can hear is Edward Norton's voice from Fight Club reading aloud. Palahniuk's and McInerney's prose styles are so unique that paying special attention cannot be avoided.)

What's more, he makes the main character very sympathetic, so despite all the ridiculous, self-indulgent bullshit he pulls, you don't feel like he's a bad person, and you want him to be okay in the end. McInerney also does a good job of painting all the Manhattan scenes- the clubs and bars where his protagonist spends his nights, and the offices of The New Yorker, where he works during the day and slowly cracks up. If the novel fails a little towards the end, that's probably appropriate as it's a lot like a cocaine trip: the beginning is a lot of fun, and the middle is pretty good, but the end never works out the way you'd like. A useful comparison would be to Easton Ellis' \"Less Than Zero\" another Catcher in The Rye set in the 80s. That one is much more depressing, as it's set in LA and is almost completely devoid of humor.
