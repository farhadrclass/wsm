I love funny books, anything that shows cleverness and has fast, snappy dialogue. Oh my, this book had that in spades. I wanted to quote every page that I read; the dialog was crazy funny in the best possible way. I couldn't help but adore this book. It was one of those books that makes you happy. It was just so sweet. I also fell in love with all of the characters. Hannah Johnson did a fab job creating unique, fully developed personalities for this book. I could totally picture each and every single one of them and I wanted them all to be my friends. My minor complaints? I could have used a LOT more heat. Like a LOT. The perv in me wanted vivid descriptions of Howie and Arthur getting it on. VIVID. I also wanted a bit more romance. More special moments between Arthur and Howie.

Not exactly...See, up to 40% of this book, I laugh out loud an uncountable number of times and even thought very very hard about giving this a 5 star rating. BUT, after that 40%, more specifically 50%, it felt like the story was dragging and I wondered really hard when was Artie finally going to stop lying to his loved ones about who he really is. Though, since this is a coming of age story, I can understand the process of denial, revelation, acceptance, etc.Nonetheless, the humor was still present after that percentage of the book but it didn\u2019t make me laugh anymore. It may be because I got used to it\u2026or maybe Howie just wasn\u2019t funny anymore. I guess the drama took a big of a higher importance and I understand that, but I still wanted to be able to laugh\u2026Don\u2019t get me wrong, I still think this is the funniest book I\u2019ve read in 2014 because 40% of a book of 317 pages is something, so I did have a great time reading it. Plus, the drama scenes weren\u2019t as dramatic as those usually are so this is incontestably a wonderful and relaxing read that I recommend to every M/M romance lover.Howie is, for sure, a very easy character to connect with. You may not agree with the way he thinks and the reasons he wants that job at Artie Kraft's Arts 'N Crafts, but never will you hate or think he is a self-centered person. Because he isn\u2019t. He cares about his mom, his brother, his friends and come to care about the people he works with as well.He was actually a realistic person with honest thoughts. The fact that we always knew everything he was thinking about was a big plus to the story since that\u2019s what makes me connect with a main character, usually. He was endearing.Artie\u2026changes. I couldn\u2019t say if it\u2019s because we don\u2019t know him at first, except from Howie\u2019s vision of him, but I feel like he had a major character development (the good kind.) He\u2019s older than Howie but you won\u2019t have the possibility to focus on that since he will charm you, reader.One character I didn\u2019t quite like though (but at first did) was Kristy. She started by being a very nice girl who cares but then I felt like she was becoming waaaay too upbeat and excited about every single good thing. She didn\u2019t feel realistic nor was I patient to deal with her so, when she wasn\u2019t in the picture, I was very happy girl.The writing is very good and brought to life the majority of characters, especially Howie, plus an absolutely comfortable atmosphere.Do you want an entertaining, original and heart-warming read?If yes, I am curiously looking at why you haven\u2019t picked this book up yet. *winks*"}, {"userName": "M", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6339324-m", "userReview": "I'm having one of those weeks where I just really need a hug. I really, really needed to read something with no angst, no bitterness, no unnecessary violence; something that's sweet without making me roll my eyes too much and funny enough to keep me entertained. This was it. My literary hug. In a huge way. It was exactly what I needed right now. There's no melodrama, no mystery and very little conflict. It's about (and narrated by) Howie, who, can I just say, is goddamn hilarious. I don't know whether my threshold for funny has been lowered or what, but I laughed my black little heart out. He is the king of side-splitting spastic monologues (and the banter, oh god, the banter!). He's this very ordinary guy, with these very ordinary post-adolescent insecurities. The story revolves around his relationships with the various people in his life. With his attraction to his (male) boss taking a starring role. But, see, this isn't like M/M romance; it's more a coming of age comedy. There's nothing explicit about it, it's just unbelievably sweet and awesome. There's no plot to speak of, and I couldn't have cared less. Plus, I liked every single person in this book. Seriously, ALL OF THEM. That is so rare. That an author can come up with such a diverse cast of lovable characters, all of them unique and every one of them someone I would totally hang out with, is a freaking miracle. I'm not sure if it's just the mood I'm in, but this book was heartfelt and wonderful. So screw all you guys who end up not liking it.

When I was done, all I wanted to do was pleasure it orally while giving it chaste kisses and then serenading it with As The World Falls Down as I walk it to its door. I love each and every word on its pages and am currently struggling not to stalk Hannah Johnson online. Howie is 22, lives at home, insistent in his heterosexuality and is a bit of an asshole in his pursuit to prove it. He applies for a job at an arts and crafts store 'cause he thinks it's a perfect place to pick girls up, but finds that not only is he not getting dates, he's also starting to fall for his very male boss, Artie. We read about his everyday misadventures at work, we root for his HEA, and we meet some of the most real and likable people in the genre.The story is told in the first person by Howie and when we meet him, he's just this spaz with an awesome sense of humor whose employment in a small-town store actually caused his mother to bake a cake.\"Apparently my ability to get a just-over-minimum-wage job that requires (basically) no skills is about as miraculous as the occasion of my birth.\"As the story progresses, though, we see what the story is behind his apparent lack of ambition and while I would have loved for there to be a resolution in that area as well, I was cool with it since the glimpse was enough to let us know that hiding behind jokes and wisecracks and inappropriate female-objectifying thoughts is actually a pretty cool guy.And Arthur, the love of our narrator's life, is a great yin to Howie's yang. He's more mature and stable in his sexuality for one. He doesn't spaz out or tend towards hysterics. He's sweet and understanding and just this solid guy that balances Howie and his jumpy energy.The supporting characters are also not just labeled \"hero's mom\", \"hero's obligatory fag hag\", \"hero's too-perfect brother\" then given predictable behavior and dialogues based on those labels. I loved that they were actually characters with depth and personalities and such awesome voices that they felt real. Seriously, guys, these characters are all so distinct and brilliant and so well written that you can give me a line from the book and I can identify which character would do or say that. They were each also essential to Howie's growth and happiness. Because Howie, for all his bravado, is practically a wee wittew boy emotionally and this book is not so much about his romance with the dreamy Arthur as it is his journey towards being an adult male with figurative testicles.Come to think of it, this was also a bit of a coming of age story of his best friend, Amber. There was a lot of growth in that front and it's a sign of how good this book is that you don't feel that Amber is encroaching in Howie's territory in her side journey towards her own HEA/HFA.You know what else is a sign of a good book? The fact that there were no genitals shoved into any orifice on-page and I didn't mind. Not one bit. This was fade-to-black sex, people, and I still embraced it in all its non-explicit sexual content-y glory. You're welcome, book.I also loved the lit references (Aunt Petunia, bitches!), the quick Monty Python nod (orgasm alert!), the most believable drunk narrative I've read in a while, and the fact that Howie's mom wrote an erotica sequel of an Austen novel and called it Mansfield Spark: The Hot Nights of Mr. and Mrs. Bertram."}, {"userName": "MLE", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2761976-mle", "userReview": "To make what could have been a very long review of gushing, and quoting, and more gushing short: I loved this book. I loved the way the characters talk, their sense of humor, and the way they interact with each other. I love that the way a character first appears does not define that person for the rest of the book. I love them for their mistakes, terrible jokes, their faults and flaws, and the fact that no matter how badly they screw up they kept trying. I love the fact that Howie's mother is so funny, and clever, and not some sort of sexless mother ideal. I like that the female characters as well as the male are fully realized people. I like that the secondary characters are just as interesting as the primary ones. I like the development of the plot. It felt natural, and unforced, and that even though many of the problems of the plot were only in the character's minds it didn't make them any less real, or valid. The writing style is engaging, and fun. It made me laugh, and it made me invested in the characters and their world.

It's definitely going to be in my best reads of the year list. I've been in the mood for a good, solid, straight-up, slow build contemporary--no shifters or magic in sight--and this was exactly what I needed. There are so many things I loved about it.First, the first person POV narrative voice was so witty and funny. It reminds me of a kinder, gentler \"Tell Me It's Real\". It took me a chapter or two to get into it, but then I just floated all the way through, often laughing outloud. I highlighted favorite passages like a wild person.Second, I love gfy-coming of age stories and this one was ideal. The main MC, Howie, is 22 but he's been living at home helping out his mom after his father's death and he is still a virgin. He thinks he likes girls--until he meets Arthur. At first there's a lot of antagonism between the two, but Hannah places lots of hints that Howie's feelings are mixed, to say the least.There's a slow-burn romance, which I love, and some lovely UST. Howie and Arthur are very cute together and crazy (obnoxious, funny) Howie helps stiff Arthur come out of his shell. I loved the setting of the yarn shop and all the secondary characters were fully-fleshed and lovable. Kristy was hilarious! And I loved the Mitch/Amber subplot. Lots of sweet, adorable feels and snarkiness. It doesn't get any better than that! If there was one thing I would have liked more of, it was the sexy times. Other than a few kisses, all of it was off-page. Which, you know, it doesn't need to be endlessly explicit, but when it's an MC's first time, and first time with a guy, I at least would like to be present for it, even if it's described in a high-level way, because it is rather transformative. But compared to the joy this book gave me, that's a minor nit.I hope Hannah Johnson writes more. I'll be first in line to buy it. Some of my favorite quotes:My mind turns back on gradually, clunkily, the way lights go on in a warehouse, row after row, click-buzzz - click-buzzzz - click-buzzzz.Every piece of me -- every nerve, every hair, every damn cell -- sings out one matching song in perfect harmony, and that song is FUUUUUUUCK....all of a sudden it's like, here he is, in the flesh, he's still a flesh-type creature that exists, and it's flesh that's been in contact with my flesh, I wish I would stop thinking the word 'flesh,' you know what's a gross, creepy, weird word? 'Flesh.' I think my brain is melting. I think I've having a stroke. Or a coronary. Or porphyria. I KNEW HE WOULD GIVE ME PORPHYRIA.\"Um,\" Arthur says. He's looking at me dead-on, like he's forcing himself to do it. God, I wish he would knock it off. I also wish he'd lose his eyelashes in a freak eyelash fire incident. And his lips, too, because all of a sudden I'm looking at them, what is that?\"I miss Lindsay, and we have, like negative chemistry. Innocent bystanders cringed when they saw us within five feet of each other.\"Come in,\" Arthur says brusquely in response to my knock -- the softest, reluctantest, unknockiest knock in the history of that long, complicated relationship betwixt doors and knuckles.Well, I could quote this book all day.

Charming story about Howie a 22 year old who puts his studies on hold to stay home and keep his mum company after the death of his father. He gets a dead-end job at an Arts & Crafts store and the people there slowly but surely change his life for the better.This story is told in the first person POV of Howie. I loved his voice. He's kind of cool in an obnoxious way. He's very confused about girls. And he's full of funny one-liners and slang that are totally in keeping with his character. His attraction to straight-laced boss Artie is delicious and very romantic. I want to write their names, 'Howie 4 Artie' and draw a big heart around it! It's the kind of story that makes you laugh out loud one minute and tugs on your heartstrings the next. But the sad bits are just as wonderful as the happy bits. And such a strong supporting cast! Everyone goes through some personal growth and no-one is quite what you expect them to be. Especially Kirsty and Emily! There is no sex in the book but there is plenty of warmth and romance to make up for it.This book ends with really heart-warming Christmas and New Year scenes and I would highly recommend it for anyone looking for a funny, romantic and poignant novel to read over the holiday season.

The characters are quirky, almost to the point of caricature, but they don't quite fall off the edge, and you end up rooting for them. Although the MCs are in their early twenties, this is very much a YA-style book. Sex is off page, and this is a first-person account of self-discovery and coming out. That's not to say the story is immature, or shallow, but that these are very young men (especially the narrator) making the mistakes and discoveries and self-conscious blunders that are part of growing up.Howie is a great narrator - self-centered and yet with underlying compassion, uncertain and willfully-blind, but full of heart. His bumbles and the straightforward voice with which he narrates them are at once funny and a little painful. Artie is perhaps a bit too good to be true, but he's the perfect foil for Howie. The secondary characters are very well done.If you like that type of story, (and can handle a touch of almost-OTT situational humor), this is the book to read.

A guy trying to work at an arts and crafts store to pick up chicks and things not going as planned? Um, yes please! Also, thanks to Arch for the recommendation. :)This book was stomach aching funny. Howie's one liners, or even dialogue in general was of a legendary sass level. His jabs at Arthur were the best. There were times when I read an opening line and had to stop and just smirk. I mean, seriously, I'm laughing as I write this just from the memories of Howie and the crew's interactions.In case you had any doubt, the cast of this book was incredibly diverse and entertaining. The author manages to juggle a dozen characters or so with complexity and diversity. Unlike lots of authors, not all of the character's in this book had similar voices or followed stereotypes. These characters broke the stereotypes and were each their own man. I loved it.Alright, time to deal with the cutest and most endearing part of this book. The relationship between Howie and Arthur. It wasn't insta-love (more like immediate hatred) and definitely slow build. Which was refreshing for a new adult novel. I loved the many layers given to both Howie and Arthur. Just when you thought you had them pegged, they'd do something surprising and wild. Even Arthur, our resident grandfather in a twenty six year old's body.

First, although the formatting and editing of the book is very good and it's rather long with 100.000+ words, I still think that $9,99 is too expensive for an unknown, self-published author. 2-4$ less would have been a fair price. Especially when thinking of similar quality books sold for 2,99$. Nevertheless the blurb and the cover got me to buying this book.Now, the story: The first few pages were very nice, got me into the story and I was looking forward to reading on. At about 6% the development was so over the top that I was thoroughly annoyed. On top of that Howie was getting on my nerves with his inner dialogue. I was really thinking of putting this book on my DNF shelf, but having paid this outrageous price, I refused to give up just yet and have to say - I'm glad. At some point the annoying things were toned down and I really started enjoying reading about Howie in denial.I very much liked the development of Howie, his growth, coming to terms with his being gay and finally accepting his life and even loving it. His relationships with his coworkers, friends and family changed and grew at a believable pace.Overall I have to say, it was a very good read, even if during the last third of the book I always was waiting for some drama to happen, but nope; it's just one nice story flowing along without any angst, drama or big misunderstanding. Thankfully it's also a story without the 'evil' woman.So, coming to the end: I will definitely read another book by this author, but only if it's available for a reasonable price.

It is very different from that book, of course, and not without it's own problems, but the awesomeness of the book and the characters outweighed my frustration with some of the writing issues, leaving me really excited and hopeful that this author will continue writing.Howie (never Howard) is stuck in his hometown. He and his twin have forged different paths, leaving him perpetually feeling like the loser twin. His brother is going to school to be a doctor, but he's stuck at home after leaving school to help his mother after their father died. They've become quite close, but Howie is stuck feeling like a kid that never grew up. He doesn't go to school, he doesn't have a job, and his mom still pretty much takes care of him. But, in talking with his best friend, Howie comes up with what he thinks is a great plan -- he'll get a job at an Arts and Crafts store to meet women. His reasoning is that girls love a sensitive guy, and knowing about all that knitting and crafts crap is sensitive, right? His best friend, who is in love with his twin, is much more pragmatic. Obviously, she tells him, they'll just think you're gay.But Howie is determined and lands a job at Artie's Arts 'N Crafts, run by Arthur himself. He immediately sets his eyes on the bubbly and cute Kristy, but finds himself creating a strange love/hate relationship with Arthur, his gay boss. Arthur is everything that Howie isn't. He's stuck up, a complete do-gooder, and a nerd to the core. But Howie soon finds that even if his love life is more complicated than he expected, having a job is helping him anyway, and the people whom he originally hated to work with become a new sort of family.This is really a coming of age story. Even though Howie is in his early twenties (22? I can't remember for sure), his growth was stunted by his move back home. Being in a rut is a rather simple way to put it, but the jealousy and hatred in having to watch his brother move onwards and upwards in life makes an already uneasy relationship downright difficult. I finished this book feeling like I knew the secondary characters almost as well as Howie, and though the book is long, the writing is somewhat dense, with quite a bit happening in an economy of space. In a way, reading this feels a bit like reading a long serial -- we get to know the characters so well because there is so much time and wealth of words to get to know them, not only in important scenes but in Howie's day to day life and interactions. I didn't have a problem with this because I never felt like any of the writing was superfluous, and it creates a really fleshed out world with complex connections between the characters.I'm making a broad generalization here, which obviously isn't true for every book and author, but this book epitomizes my reasons for liking to read online original fiction and self published books. Sometimes, when I read something like this, I feel like it's set apart from the m/m community, where the characters (or archetypes) and their actions tend to grow homogenized and feed off one another. We often say or hear things like, we want more realism or more realistic characters, which in all actuality we don't literally want. Maybe it is the absence of editors, or some other difference I'm not sure of, but this book actually felt more real to life. The rough edges aren't buffed out, and while that may be somewhat annoying in the prose, it is pure gold to me in the content when done by an intelligent and talented author. Sure, this author could have been reigned in at times -- the dialogue tends to spiral out of control at points, Howie can be rather infuriating sometimes with long periods of annoying behavior, and a few other things I've forgotten by now -- but in the big picture, they mattered less to me than the central core of the story, which was beautifully written and executed.I very much hope that this author continues to write and publish, in whatever manner, because I'll remain a reader for life, and I know that I'll continue to read and re-read this book. So I definitely want all of you to read it as well."}, {"userName": "Leanne", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4124254-leanne", "userReview": "Oh, I loved this story! Howie is an adorable underdog. At 22, the aimless twin of a perfect brother, he has sacrificed dreams of travel and escape from his little town to stay with his mom. He\u2019s outwardly brash and funny as hell but inside he\u2019s mostly sad and insecure. His finding a job at the craft store does so much more than lead him to love. It allows him to start believing in himself, to learn to open up and to trust others. Yes, he does accept the fact that he\u2019s gay with surprisingly few qualms, but the fact that he\u2019s more worried about disappointing others shows the sweetness and sensitivity of this manboy. There is no sex in the book and, while I would have loved a bit more heat, there is enough warmth of the fuzzy variety to make up for it. (I really didn't miss it. Much.) However, a good balance of snarkiness and poignancy keeps it from being too overly sweet. With a charming cast of supporting characters and great pop culture and literary references peppered throughout ,( in fact, it kind of comes with its own soundtrack) I can totally see this as a John Hughes-type movie. Just what has happened to those fantastic coming-of-age movies anyway? As a teen of the eighties I\u2019m just showing my age here, I guess. ;-PSweet, charming, funny and beautifully written \u2013 I\u2019ll snap up anything Hannah Johnson writes next.

I only gave it a 2 because I did actually sort of like the other caricatures characters in the book. The only reason I didn't DNF it was because it was a buddy read. I could spend a lot of time and energy going over why I hated this book, but it's not worth it. Bottom line? Howie is an immature, selfish asshole to his classmates, his love interest, his best friend, his brother's girlfriend... the list goes on. Sure, he sort of gets over it by the end. But for the first, oh, 95% of the book, I mostly just wanted to run him over with an 80s Volvo. If the author had spent less time being \"fucking ironic\" (yes, an actual quote that presumably was thrown in to explain the more-annoying-than-Jack Black-esque narration, and Howie's incredibly trite sense of humor), and more time on actual character development, I might have understood why Arthur fell for Howie.

Howie is a character that is so layered and witty and real that I couldn't help but fall in love with him. Seriously, the one-liners in this book are priceless.I ADORED Kristie and even Cora made me laugh. I wasn't really fond of Amber, but she wasn't distracting enough to detract from the rest of the book.The slow build between Howie and Arthur was a nice change from the insta-love that floods this genre, but I will say the 'romance' was lacking in this for me greatly. Arthur and Howie really felt more like buddies than boyfriends and I can't honestly say I understand why EITHER of them like each other in a romantic way. Truthfully, Arthur is dull as hell. But all the stars go to Howie and his adventures."}, {"userName": "Audrey", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2413680-audrey", "userReview": "Not feeling very review-y articulate, so here are some pretty random thoughts.- Brilliant and hilarious narrative, even if I'm not normally a fan of (1) first person and (2) present tense.- Sweet romance.- A discovering yourself/coming out m/m story.- Kind of \"new adult.\" (22 y.o. narrator.)- Great, great, GREAT secondary characters.- So bummed it was closed door sexytimes.

It just struck me that the author was trying way too hard to be funny, and it got on my nerves.But the more I read, the more natural the narrator's voice felt. I don't know if it was me getting used to it, or the writing getting better but it got less forced and at some point I discovered, I actually did think it was funny, and even caught myself laughing out loud once or twice.What's good about this book is the characters. Some of them come across as somewhat stereotypical, but others were refreshingly original. Especially Emily, and I really loved Amber and Mitch. My only complaint is that I wish there had been more romance. This is more a coming-of-age tale than a romance. What romance there is is very adorable, I just wanted more! I'm not bothered by the lack of on-page sex. That was fine. I just wanted more mushy moments between Howie and Arthur, because they were very very cute together.I also thought Howie's journey was very believable, and very sincere without ever being heavy-handed. His initial denial and then acceptance of being gay was handled in a way that made sense, but never beat the reader over the head. I loved when he very simply acknowledged that his original attraction to Kristy was him trying to convince himself that he should be attracted to her. It wasn't over-explained, just a very off-hand mention but it was so perfect. And him realizing that what he feels for Arthur is very different from anything he'd felt for any girls he'd dated. It was just really sweet, without all the \"OMG, I'm GAY!\" angst that I'm so tired of.So in the end, I ended up really enjoying this book. It was a little on the long side, but then when it ended I was like \"Nooo!\" I wanted more Howie and Arthur."}, {"userName": "Madison Parker", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7294850-madison-parker", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this story. Howie has such a great sense of humor. The other people in his life may look at him and just see your average young guy, but being inside his head, we get to experience all of his wonderfully wacky thoughts. Although the characters in this book are all at least 22 years old, it had a \"young adult\" feel to it. I guess Howie was a late bloomer.I do wish we'd gotten more \"alone time\" with Howie and Arthur, but I respect the author's choice not to include their intimate moments. The story felt like it was more about Howie and his self-discovery than the romance between him and Arthur. There's romance there, but it's not the focus of the book.Overall, an entertaining read with a lovable MC."}, {"userName": "Sheri", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7300331-sheri", "userReview": "Witty & fun.
