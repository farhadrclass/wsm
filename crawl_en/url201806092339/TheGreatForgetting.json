We have to trust that what we remember is fact. And we have to trust what other people remember for things we never saw.\"\u2026 It was a disturbing and thrilling realization, that our grasp of the truth is dependent on the honesty of older generations, on the companies who write history books.once again james renner has written a kickass novel that is impossible to review. it's a little bit easier than The Man from Primrose Lane because the book doesn't suddenly reinvent itself in the middle, but it's definitely a book where caution is required in reviewing. it's best if you don't know what's going to happen until it's happening all around you. which is the main difference between this book and a swarm of hornets.if i had to sell it in five words, it would be: conspiracy theory road trip novel.fortunately, i have so many more words. like these: umami pepsi. make this a thing, please.not a helpful review so far. so let me try to explain. there's a kind of novel that always feels like a home when i come across one. i can't articulate exactly what it is about these books except that they are paradoxically both exciting and comforting to me; my heart beats faster while my body relaxes. they have nothing in common with each other, although they frequently fall into the place where postmodern metafiction intersects with slipstream and kinda knocks you over sideways a little and has you questioning reality.Ron Currie Jr., The Sea Came in at Midnight, Jonathan Carroll, When We Were Animals, Gretel and the Dark, Infinite Jest, Evan Dara, The Dead Lands, Magnetic Field etc etc. it's a feeling that registers as a tightening in my armskin first, and then i get warm and still and my brain locks in and i'm just gone. it feels like reading the forgotten bits of my own dreams (which already sounds like the plot to a jonathan carroll novel. feel free to run with it, j.c.) but also like how it feels to wake up after a seizure or a fainting spell, where everything is half-familiar, half-foreign. if you've never experienced either of those things, it is like how disoriented sam must feel at the beginning of each episode of quantum leap. ask your parents.but anyway, this is one of THOSE books. one of MY books.it's such a specific experience - i rarely get deeply immersed in a book where i'm not constantly aware of myself-as-reader, but it's more than just immersion; it's quite physical. there are plenty of books i love that don't give me this feeling, and there are plenty of books that started to (House of Leaves) but then ended up going in a different direction. and all of this is just blather because i'd much rather tackle the task of trying to explain some weirdo feeling i get sometimes that is likely due to an undiagnosed neurological disorder than to risk ruining this book by saying too much. but for those of you who need more than just \"how it makes my arms feel\" to decide whether or not to read a book, it's about history, memory, regret, some nerd bullshit, family, madness, secret agencies with your best interests in mind, grief, urban legends and \"what really happened to\u2026,\" the idea that knowledge is power, but memory even more so, and whether it's better to remember and learn from mistakes both personal and cultural or to forget every last bit of shame and humiliation and historical atrocity and start over unencumbered. and bigfoot.also, the truth about the moon is finally revealed and, oddly enough, it's what i've been saying for years.renner does a really good job, through different characters, addressing some of the questions that would naturally arise from people confronted with Great Truths, but i still have a million questions, or at least two. which i will hold for now until this is published (not long now!) and we can all chat about it. unless there's another round of the great forgetting and all of this gets wiped from my mind. but i can't tell you any more until you start boiling your water.**********************************************yayyy! i totally forgot this was being sent to me and i opened the package thinking it was a different book and then i went SQUAWKKKK real loud when i saw what it was so i thank you james renner and st martins for making me scare my cat! review coming..."}, {"userName": "Kelly (and the Book Boar)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11183856-kelly-and-the-book-boar", "userReview": "Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/Because this came out yesterday and it's amazing so it gets a bump.

This book is smart. Like wicked smart. But don\u2019t let that intimidate you. Renner has done a great job of providing a cast of characters that are all Average Joes. While they find themselves put in spectacular circumstances, they are people with not-genius IQs so you never get lost in the crazy that is being thrown at you. Renner also does something that normally I hate \u2013 he inundates the reader with the present. Now, this may end up being a novel that doesn\u2019t quite stand the test of time, but for today? Right now? This sonofabitch WORKS! If you\u2019re into conspiracy theories and a story that stays on eleven for the duration, The Great Forgetting is not one to be missed.

Review over \u2013 now for the full disclosure B.S. I never had contact with James Renner until he personally messaged me and asked if I would like to review his new book. Turns out he saw my review of The Man From Primrose Lane (which all of you should immediately read because the man ain\u2019t no one-hit-wonder) and didn\u2019t despise my giffy style (SUCK IT, GIF HATERS!).

I should probably float my reviews all day every day more frequently in order to break into the Top 5 of the fake popularity contest. Whatevs. Anyway to make a long story even longer, endless thanks to Mr. Renner (and to Trudi who turned me on to his work in the first place).

The mystery is clever and engaging and fascinatingly strange, but what really struck my fancy was just how good the characters are. So much has happened in their lives and just getting to the point of the next reveal kept me glued to the page. These aren't even big reveals, just character reveals, and yet because Jack kept digging, this whole book took on a fantastic dimension that just got deeper and deeper as we find out more about Tony and Cole and the way the human mind can be a real nutter. The whole book is a gradient. It starts you out with the small stuff and as you get acclimated, it gets steeper and steeper into nutter land. I'm just glad I already boil all my water. Of course, that may be because I drink little more than coffee and tea, but you know how it is. I avoid my Flouride in my water. :)From there, however, I can't and won't spoil you, but if you're a conspiracy theory nut, yourself, do yourself a favor and read this little gem of a novel. Take a bag of your favorite theories, shake them around, take three handfuls of them, and now toss them in the air. Make connections. Build a story around them where they all fit together. Now read this book. How closely do they match?Not close enough? Fine. Add another handful of theories and build another story. Closer? YES! lolI can't believe the author got away with everything he did. The mystery connections were set up with some real brilliance. :) And this, my friends, became one hell of a great SF. :)With one caveat: I debated knocking off a star for the slightly unsatisfying ending, but the whole ride of the rest of the novel was so strong and fascinating that I simply couldn't do that. I had a really great time. For those who've already read it, I liked the Prologue fine. It was the big action scene at the end and the immediate results of it, but not related to he-who-must-not-be-named. Maybe I just wanted something different to happen.But everything else? I went fanboy all over it. :)Thanks goes to the author for a physical copy of this book!

James Renner is the author of the mind-bending, genre-mashing The Man from Primrose Lane and you really must read that one if you are looking for something that is wholly unlike anything else. There was some buzz a few years back that Bradley Cooper had been tapped to star in a film adaptation, but no updates on that yet. I didn't know what to expect in picking up The Great Forgetting, but you can bet I approached it with keen anticipation. Renner is a brave author who doesn't ever make safe choices. He marches out into the badlands of crazy and bewildering, sees what he finds there, and then puts it into his story. It doesn't always work, but considering the kind of unique crazy pants he's peddling, it works amazingly, unforgettably (heh) well most of the time. This one starts as almost a quiet domestic drama: an unassuming high school teacher returns to his hometown where his sister is looking after their senile father. Jack has to deal with an ex-girlfriend who married his best childhood friend Tony. But Tony has gone missing and his wife wants Jack to help her get him declared deceased. In his efforts to do this, Jack meets a boy named Cole, the last person Tony had any significant contact with before his disappearance. Cole is a patient in a psychiatric ward suffering from complex and paranoid delusions. Or are they? The more Jack talks to him the further down the rabbit hole he goes. And takes us with him. Side note of interest: James Renner is definitely an author to watch. And while he has a noteworthy talent spinning wild and crazy tales of speculative fiction, Renner is also a dedicated true crime writer. He is currently researching the unsolved disappearance of Umass nursing student, Maura Murray and will publish True Crime Addict in May 2016 about his experiences. The Maura Murray case is a real life rabbit hole story and it is very easy to become lost in all the moving pieces and arm chair detective theories that exist for this cold case. Renner also maintains a blog of his ongoing investigations that makes for riveting reading if you are into that sort of thing. Two young armchair detectives are also hosting a pretty decent podcast right now about the Maura Murray case in which Renner has been a guest. The hosts are currently at work on a documentary."}, {"userName": "Jeanette", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette", "userReview": "Almost a 4 star but I cannot round it up. It was at least 4 star in entertainment value, until the last 1/3rd of the book. Then it was not.The time conundrums and other facile interconnections of gradients (as this book defines gradients) did not make sense by then, and the outcomes became cartoonish as a result. This author has immense skill in interfacing current or past minutia of culture and media into context of story and characters. That was absolutely 5 star level, and the parts of the book I liked the best. It reminded me of an early Stephen King.But with extra long verbosity and introduction of too many intersects to match past Nazi or \"forgotten\" history, for me anyway- the tension dissolved. By page 250 only a few of the characters kept their depth. And by page 300, they all had progressed from idealistic yet flat cardboard figures and finally converted to tech game avatars. Very disappointed that such an excellent slant and conceptual premise could have ended up as only a 3 star. Because the premise is an exceptional one and it was translated well for a goodly portion. Mu itself and its components were ridiculous in comparison. Forgot to add: ITALICS. Flash-backed past events and characters' histories are represented by a break in the normal print pattern/chapter. In other words, you will have page after page after page of italics to read over a dozen times in this book. It was appalling. No, beyond annoying to the point that I was taken right out of the complex storyline. Please, please, please, publishers and authors. Return to a more chronological and English specific norm of print.

Definitely don't read this review unless you've read the book or unless you're positively sure you never will\u2014come back later if you think you may read it at some point in the future, because The Great Forgetting definitely benefits from its surprises, wacky and flawed as they may be.I don't think there's any better way to describe my experience with The Great Forgetting than to relate two separate encounters I had while reading it.I was halfway into Part 2 when my friend saw me reading this book. \"Any good?\" she asked. I nodded fiercely. \"I can't wait to finish it. It's just so wild!\"The next time she saw me reading it, a few days later, I was mere pages from the end. \"Almost done, huh?\" she asked. I sighed heavily and nodded. \"I can't wait to finish it. It's just so... wild.\" \"Good wild?\"I shook my head. \"Bad wild.\"See, the very thing that drew me into the story in the first place\u2014the craziness of it\u2014was the same thing that became so grating by the end. With every new aspect the author introduced, my disbelief became harder and harder to suspend until it was so ludicrous I rolled my eyes several times per chapter. But let's backtrack for a second. The Great Forgetting is what I would call conspiracy fiction\u2014it imagines not an alternate world from our own but the same one we live in, with all the secrets and covert plots laid bare. When the only main conspiracy Renner tackled was the titular one (radio signals causing people's minds to be wiped, allowing them to partake in a communal delusion and a shared yet false history) I was hooked. It was just in the right place between \"plausible\" and \"crackpot nonsense\" that reading about the protagonist delving further into something he initially dismissed was simultaneously entertaining and really engaging. But then Renner just had to go and through every single goddamned conspiracy theory ever hatched into this book, and it was just. Too much. Don't believe me? Here's a list of conspiracies The Great Forgetting incorporates into its plot, just off the top of my head:- Bigfoot- Nazi scientists- the Holocaust- fluoridated water- Amelia Earhart- D. B. Cooper- the lost continent of Mu- Alcatraz escapees- fabricated history- faked deaths- genetically engineered humanoids- chemtrails- the 9/11 attacks- Malaysia Airlines Flight 370- Area 51- Morgellons Syndrome- secret tunnels through mountain ranges- underground cities- and practically everything but lizard people. And to be honest, I was kind of surprised that after all this nonsense, Mr Renner didn't just throw a repitilian overlord into the mix for shits and giggles.But the ludicrous amount of conspiracies\u2014even a few of which are too many to keep from scoffing at outright\u2014wasn't the only bloated part of this novel. There were also way too many characters, several of which could easily be eliminated (such as Becky, Zaharie, Nils, and who the fuck even was Constance?). This issue isn't helped by the fact that every single character gets at least one mini-chapter where the omniscient narrator is in their head, so we see things from their point of view. It keeps the story from ever feeling focused on one plot, one issue, until the very end, and by then it's far too late. Plus, most of the conflicts that these alternate POV passages bring up are never touched on again, let alone resolved, rendering this tactic doubly ineffective.Further, the characters themselves aren't interesting enough to warrant such a large number of them. The protagonist, Jack Felter, is pretty boring, being constantly moral and responsible and perfect and just generally not having a personality. His love interest Sam has a bit more going on, but her interesting tragic backstory was mentioned in the beginning and rarely seemed to affect her afterwards. And don't even get me started about Tony\u2014Tony was just a fucking mystery to me. I guess I'm just supposed to accept his last-act transformation into a villain, and the fact that he was practically the human equivalent of a stale cracker despite everyone loving him and willing to walk the world for him.Also... I refuse to believe that I'm reading into this just because I'm gay\u2014there was definitely something happening between Tony and Jack, right? What the hell was that relationship? Jack remembers feeling closer to Tony than he'd ever felt with anyone else (even Sam, apparently). As kids they slept so close together in their sleeping bags that Jack fell asleep with Tony's breath on his face. They say they love each other pretty often\u2014and before you come at me with that \"they're just good friends\" and \"men can be vulnerable and loving with their friends, too\", hang on! Jack doesn't just mention loving Tony, he mentions falling in love with him, and he says that it happened \"the same way it happened with women.\" Okay, so I guess we just have to leave it at that, because Renner just sort of drops it without any real elaboration or exploration of this relationship. I guess they're just two straight guys who fell in love... straightly? And then fell in love with the same woman? (And speaking of, what the hell was up with that situation? The author acts like \"falling into bed\" with your best friend and his girlfriend is a totally natural thing that happens, but, uh, you know, it's definitely not. I don't casually visit people and wind up\u2014oops!\u2014sleeping with them and their significant other. Sam, Tony, and Jack's whole threesome/side-relationship thing was just baffling and it came out of absolutely nowhere.)I don't mean to disparage all of the characters, though. Cole and the Captain were pretty great. Jean was great, too. What united these side characters, interestingly enough, is that they have compelling backstories AND flaws. They're layered and they're human and they're far from perfect. Their chapters were the only thing that redeemed the multiple-POV format.Onto the writing. The prose in this book is nothing to write home about, but it's tremendously readable from start to finish so credit to Mr Renner for keeping things flowing smoothly there. Renner has a very specific talent that I noted a few times: he's very good at describing sound. I remember one noise being described as a thousand rubber balls rolling down staircases, for example. So that was pretty cool. But tonally, this book really confused me. I could never put my finger on how seriously it wanted to be taken. In some places, it seemed like Renner was being almost tongue-in-cheek with his scores of conspiracy references, but in others it seemed like he genuinely wanted to make a larger point about humanity. There were some serious and thought-provoking passages about memory, immediately followed by these madcap chases by Nazi-created yeti-men with teleportation belts that totally threw the whole thing off. It was like tonal whiplash.There was also a huge missed opportunity for some awesome meta-mindfuckery with the mention that some of the memories we'd previously read were altered\u2014but nothing ever came of it. You never know why some memories were changed, or what they were originally. Which really bummed me out because I was ready for my head to be screwed with in a way that wasn't just another rehashing of that \"alternate history where the Nazis took over\" shtick.I feel like I'm tearing this book to shreds and I really don't mean to. The first third is so interesting and engaging, and the parts with Cole showing Jack the \"gradient,\" where you're not sure if he's trying to pull Jack into his delusions or if he's really perfectly sane, are fantastic. There was a delicious tension and conflict between what Jack believed and what he was being told, and later between what he believed and what he saw. I loved Cole's manipulation, earnest and clever as it was, and the moment when Jack had to decide whether to believe that he was crazy, or that there truly was a conspiracy so far-reaching it effected everyone else in the world. But once Jack threw himself into the conspiracy of the Great Forgetting, everything became so much more contrived.One last thing before I go. The denouement of this story was just so problematic. I already had lowered my expectations after the \"paradise island where everything and everyone is happy and perfect\" segment, but good god did the ending just wreck it all. Not only did it involve all but two of the main cast of characters crashing suddenly to their deaths, but there was so much \"Aha, I knew you would do that, which is why I did THIS! Bwahahaha!\" it was just embarrassing. I feel like the rushed ending was the final nail in the coffin for me here, and the only reason this book was spared from getting two stars is because I really did love it in the beginning. Alas, sometimes a story just derails after a promising start. It's a special kind of disappointing."}, {"userName": "Lea", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3397530-lea", "userReview": "Okay. Where to start with this one . . . The problem is that this is one of those books where nearly anything you say about it could be a spoiler. What's a girl to do? I want to rave about this book and explain in minute detail why you should be reading it RIGHT NOW -- instead of reading this review -- and yet, I so desperately do not want to ruin it for you so I can't say anything!James Renner -- who, full disclosure, sent me this book -- is kind of scary, in that I'm pretty sure he literally looked into my brain and wrote this book using all that twisted information. And geez, how lucky is that?! So I finally get to read a book that combines all of the kooky nonsense I love, combined with alternative history -- which is my favourite kind of history -- in a big ball of unputdownable craziness. The only thing it needed was some sasquatch -- oh wait, there's that, too.Seriously. The man is a genius. A frightening, mind reading genius.And the references -- all the lovely lovely references, so much fun! Some of them are just little throw away nods to other books and writers. Some of them are deeper references that give your brain a little push, a \"hey what do you think about this\" kind of thing. And some are super gigantic enormous plot spoilery things that might make you a bit emotional. And it's all awesome.I want to shift gears here just a bit to address the women in the book. There are two main female character -- there are others, but they're not as involved throughout the story -- Sam, the former love interest, and Jean, the sister. Writing it that way makes them seem very peripheral to the story, but they really aren't. What I found very interesting was that the author resisted the temptation to make them saintly. These are flawed characters, but ultimately . . . heroic. (As an aside, you could say the same about all of these characters.) Renner had me worried initially, as he described Sam's hair as \"cinnamon\" -- and I thought, here we go, another gorgeous woman who is more dream than human, when will you men stop doing that?! And then we find out that Sam has done some not so nice stuff, the biggest one being leaving our man Jack for his best friend -- and that simple fact kept me guessing about where her loyalties really were and whether or not I could trust her. Eventually we're given some more information that helps us see Sam in a different light -- I thought it was all very clever. Jack's sister, Jean, has a similarly troubled past, and battles her demons throughout the story as well. I wasn't really sure that Jean would be there for the group when she needed to be.The author's book The Man from Primrose Lane: A Novel is one of my favourites -- I've read it multiple times. Pretty sure I'm going to be re-reading this one several times as well, just to catch all of the details I missed the first time around.Final word -- you need to read this book!

It\u2019s a bold move for Renner to attempt to change that narrative, to make it that his characters are trying to save America from the Great Forgetting and never intended to kill all of those people, and I honestly loathed it. At some point I was trying to explain to B why I found the 9/11 revision so distasteful & he told me that he thought the re-imagining of WWII was just as bad. I disagree, simply because this book doesn't make any bones about WWII being bad - it's still atrocity, it's even much worse. Changing 9/11 from a terrorist attack to something that's being perpetrated by the good guys of the story grosses me out, especially when someone, Captain I think, makes the case that the \"collateral damage\" who might be killed would surely be down to die in the name of ending the Great Forgetting.The writing goes downhill altogether once everyone gets to Mu, and the last 40 or so pages make me feel like Renner had a page cap that he was rushing towards, so he cut tons of stuff that would actually make the denouement make sense, as atrocious as it was. The death of Jean pisses me off in particular.

Sam broke his heart by choosing his best friend over him. He wants to leave that adolescent pain in the past where it belongs, but Sam approaches him almost immediately with a problem.The problem?Tony, his best friend, disappeared three years ago.

The rest of the world is. And yes, I know how crazy that sounds.\"Jack plays along, hoping Cole can somehow lead to Tony.But something happens. Cole reveals a selectively-known theory, a conspiracy that's been hidden in plain sight for nobody knows how long.\"The only thing easier than rewriting history is deleting history.\"\"It was called The Great Forgetting.\"The Great Forgetting is a complicated plot to unravel, the basics being rolled out through what Cole's father called the Seven Gradients.It begins with flouride, first used in Nazi concentration camps (true). It jumps from there to the Emergency Alert System (which, play Devil's advocate if i may, was not functioning on the morning of September 11th, 2001). It keeps going until you're up to your neck in mercury, Mohamed Atta, Mangele... And the Maestro.The Great Forgetting is overseen by a shadow ops group and handled by a secret person known as the Maestro. There's no way to know what all's been covered up, what all's been erased, and what all's been rewritten.\"This is fucking crazy.\"As hard to believe as it obviously is, the history nerd in Jack is eager to listen to Cole's plot, partially for his own enjoyment, partially because it may very well tell him where that son of a bitch Tony is.But Jack didn't count on one contingency.Cole's not crazy.Cole's theories, Jack realizes, are all rooted in obscure nuggets of truth.

Now, I don't wish I'd written what was Renner's first novel because I consider it to be the greatest work of literature ever; I cherish The Man from Primrose Lane because Renner was able to write in a way that I love but am\u2014at present\u2014incapable of duplicating. You see, when it comes to stories I have two great loves: one is the dramatic, the epic, the heart warming and the heartrending (East of Eden, Atonement, Short Term 12, The Wonder Years); the other (which I love in equal measure), is the bizarre, the unexpected, the paranormal and paranoid (The Twilight Zone, The X-Files, We Have Always Lived in the Castle). In my own writing, I write like the first. I'm okay with that. But I do wish I could write in both styles. And The Man from Primrose Lane is the best, most unexpected work in the genre I've come across since the heyday of the genre in the sixties and seventies.So when I cracked open the cover of The Great Forgetting I was thrilled to discover a nod to The Twilight Zone itself in a chapter title and epigraph. It took all of two minutes to realize the entire book was filled with these titles and quotes. (I admit I flipped all the way through to the end reading the episode titles and reminiscing about the classic sci-fi show before reading the novel's opening paragraph.) At this point, expectations were high. SUPER HIGH.Renner didn't let me down. Right away the story was intriguing. I was pulled into the mystery and marveled at the brilliance of the plot. My appetite for conspiracies was sated. There was a little bit of all those elements that make the genre great without a loss of quality writing. I made speculations as to what was going on; my reading was fueled by my desire to reach the conclusion.Then the novel became a bit bogged down by all it was trying to hold up and keep together. The story depended too much on its absurdities and grew convoluted. In defense of the author, I admit it was a lot to hold together: layered conspiracies, anomalies, maintaining relevance, and being the follow-up to such a great predecessor. Certainly, only a well-trained, intelligent and patient author could even formulate such a plot. Myself, I am not such an author.(Note: This is a vague review. It's vague on purpose, because the thing about Renner's style is that saying anything is almost saying too much. This was particularly true with The Man from Primrose Lane, but it applies here as well.)So yes, I hoped for more with The Great Forgetting, but that's not to say I was disappointed. My expectations were high, and even though Renner's second novel did not reach the heights I had hoped for, it was still an engrossing, well-written novel. I've read some Stephen King. I've read every novel of David Mitchell's. Without a doubt, James Renner is of their caliber. Oh, my other great love? Willy Wonka. And there were several nods to the candyman in this novel as well.

Elle demande donc \u00e0 Jack de l'aider \u00e0 le retrouver, mort ou vif.Jack se lance donc \u00e0 la recherche de son ancien ami, et commence par se rapprocher du dernier patient de Tony, Cole, un jeune homme de 16 ans enferm\u00e9 dans une institution car il affirme que le gouvernement nous cache la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et qu'il change les \u00e9v\u00e9nements du pass\u00e9 \u00e0 sa guise.

Si il a un point que j'ai vraiment bien appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 c'est la fa\u00e7on dont l'auteur s'empare de toutes les th\u00e9ories du complot qu'on voit trainer sur internet, comme les Chemtrails, ou le fluor dans l'eau pour en faire une intrigue \u00e9norme et qui se tient !Sur ce point j'imagine qu'il c'est r\u00e9gal\u00e9 et \u00e7a fait plaisir \u00e0 voir. j'avoue que c'est limite jubilatoire certaines fois et \u00e7a m'a bien fait marrer.Par contre pour moi l'auteur est all\u00e9 (un peu) trop loin. A tel point qu'a certains moments on avait plus l'impression de trouver des gadgets sortis de Doctor Who (la ceinture boomerang ...) sans le moindre explications scientifique, que de vrais objets futuristes cr\u00e9dibles. Et c'est la que \u00e7a a bloqu\u00e9, parce que si je ne peux pas valider ce point ci, tout le reste retombe totalement \u00e0 plat et \u00e7a compromet la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de l'ensemble du sc\u00e9nario du livre parce qu'il est cens\u00e9 se d\u00e9rouler dans un futur proche.Du coup je suis un peu mitig\u00e9e sur l'ensemble, et j'ai eu du mal \u00e0 avancer pass\u00e9 un certain cap, surtout que c'est \u00e0 se moment la que certaines longueurs sont apparues, dans la seconde partie.C'est vraiment dommage parce que si on retire ce point la le reste est bien trouv\u00e9.J'avoue par contre que j'ai ador\u00e9 la fin, elle boucle vraiment tout et nous retourne la situation de fa\u00e7on vraiment int\u00e9ressante.

So Jack packs up and returns to his tiny hometown of Franklin Mills. It's not exactly a welcome homecoming for Jack. He's avoided Franklin Mills ever since his girlfriend married his best friend. Yes, that's right, Jack's girlfriend, Sam, married Jack's best friend, Tony. And now Tony is missing. Tony's been gone for three years now and Sam is ready to move on. Without a body, though, the police won't allow Tony to be declared dead. Here's where Jack comes in: Sam is sure that Tony offed himself in the local lake and appeals to Jack for help. If he can find the body, Sam can collect on the life insurance. Then she won't lose everything she's worked for in the time since Tony abandoned her. Jack agrees and arranges for a diver who does indeed turn up a body. And that's when things get really complicated. And weird. You should know that this is not an easy book to sum up, especially without giving too much away. It involves history, some insane conspiracy theories (conspiracy theories that do exist!) and memory as we perceive it. It's a twisty turny read that will likely head in directions that you won't expect - or at least I didn't - it starts with an Epilogue for goodness sake! From the start we do know that Jack is not looking forward to running into Sam. You might question, then, why he would be so willing to help her out (per the synopsis above). Well, present day Jack keeps things close for a while but Franklin Mills does force him to confront issues from his past, like his relationships with Sam and Tony. Through flashbacks we discover how they all met, how the relationships formed, and what ultimately went wrong. We also get flashbacks from a few other characters, all of which - and whom - move the story along quite brilliantly. I'm going to stop there because I'm really too afraid of spoiling it. I've already removed quite a few things from this post that I thought would do exactly that so I know any more time I spend trying to write this risks even more potential surprise ruining quips. I will add that I'm an unabashed fan girl for James Renner's fiction. His debut, The Man From Primrose Lane, is one of my all time favorites. That book blew me away and left me waiting with baited breath to see what Renner would have in store for readers the next go around. And while Man set the bar pretty high as far as expectations go, I have to say that The Great Forgetting more than lived up to those expectations.
