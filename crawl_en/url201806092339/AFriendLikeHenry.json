It is an emotional rollercoaster of a story and one that is exhausting to witness. The early years with their son were much more than most parents could endure. What I really like about this book is the fact that it shows what can be done with patience and an unwillingness to give up. This boy had severe autism right from birth and no one could predict what he could one day accomplish. Getting a family dog was not a miracle cure, but one that helped bridge the gap between the son and his parents. They used the dog to communicate with their son, eventually reaching him. I have used a similar approach with my son's Sesame Street characters when I cannot get his attention and it almost always works. These parents are one of the most patient that I have encountered, and it is only by their sheer will and patience that their son does as well as he does. It also gives hope for all with such a severe case of autism."}, {"userName": "Faith Chin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6762586-faith-chin", "userReview": "I think this book was A-MA-ZING!!!! I never knew a non fiction book could be so interesting!!! Never judge a book by its cover!!! This book is about, well, the author herself, Nuala Gardner, her autistic son Dale, and a dog that changed their lives. Yes, a dog. The character I'm going to do today is none other than Dale. The first thing you must know about Dale is that he's autistic. Autism is not a sickness but a condition. It's something you're born with. Dale does have autism, but it was so severe, Nuala couldn't do anything to help her son and break into his autistic world. She almost wanted to commit suicide once because she can't take any more of Dale's autism. When Dale had autism, he was just a young toddler and that is when his autism was so great. He'd scream when angry. He'd go crazy. He acts so stubborn and rude. Autism has taken over his body. But as he grew up, things changed a little. He got a new dog. Yes. He named his golden retriever dog Henry after one of the trains in Thomas the Tank Engine show. Henry was a train he really loved. He loved trains. With Henry, he could do anything. Communicate, make eye contact, learn to go potty, eat proper food, take a bath and even say the words \"I love you\". It is very hard for people who has autism to show feelings, especially love. When Nuala heard those words, oh, they were music to her ears and the words she'd finally wanted to hear. When he grew up, of course he acts like a normal teenager. Hanging out with friends, chatting and so on. He became the person Nuala wanted him to be. But Henry has come to an end. Henry has done an awful lot for Dale that made Dale change his life and the person Dale is now. Henry has finally broke into his autistic world and change Dale. When Nuala gave birth to Dale's little sister, Amy, she too, has autism. Dale spend his time helping Nuala with Amy. Henry, he became an old dog. He did an awful lot to help this family and they bid him farewell when he died of a terrible sickness. Dale, can never forget his life with Henry. Holding back tears is hard but I did anyway. People, read this. Just do it. Friends are important to have, but a friend like Henry can really make someone happy. Can a dog this special really change someone's life? The Gardners never knew what hit them, when they found a friend like Henry."}, {"userName": "Lydia LaPutka", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1628404-lydia-laputka", "userReview": "This book was very enjoyable. I highly recommend it to teachers, dog lovers, and anyone affected by autism. It takes you through many emotions--depression, elation, frustration, heartbreak, joy, anxiety, etc., etc. I think I gasped aloud on several occasions! Any book that elicits that much physical, stark emotion in me is right up my alley. Having had several mildly autistic students in my years as a teacher, I can't imagine parenting one with classic autism. This author poured her heart and soul into telling her family's story. Even now, I can't fully imagine how hard it must be. It's overwhelming and exhausting just thinking about it. I loved that the author accepted a different normal and fought tooth and nail for her children. For me, I would have liked to learn more about Nuala's husband, Jamie. I realize this was her account of their life, but I know Jamie did more than the story explains. Men handle crises so much differently than women, so it would have been fascinating to hear more from his perspective. I loved the end where we got Dale's perspective about his upbringing and challenges. How insightful and profound!"}, {"userName": "Sheree", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1612410-sheree", "userReview": "A harrowing & inspirational true story of the Gardner family written from the mother's perspective in honest, blunt language.This is not a flowery, descriptive telling, it is a matter-of-fact recount of day to day life with a severely autistic child. Nuala & Jamie's fight to have Dale's autism recognised & officially diagnosed, the anger & sadness, the depths of despair reached, the exhaustion & the small triumphs that kept them going. The all-consuming struggle to break into Dale's world in order to give their child a chance at a normal life.I found Nuala's struggle to get Dale diagnosed heartbreaking. She is a community nurse and qualified midwife and many of the scenes she described with the medical profession were unfortunately all to familiar to me when seeking help for my own son.* Doctors acting as if the parents were seeking attention rather than help for their son * honest, passionate accounts of home difficulties were classed as negative responses * factual accounts amounted to Nuala being rather cold and detached* professionals stating that conflict between parents and child causing Dale's behavioural difficulties.It's very distressing when a life that is already such an arduous climb becomes an insurmountable mountain courtesy of so called professionals. On a positive note, there is no substitute for a parent's determination when it comes to protecting the rights and well being of their child. When Dale was finally diagnosed & Nuala & Jamie found the best assistance for him, the years of support & encouragement provided were immeasurable. Of course the momentous breakthrough that unlocked Dale's world came through the friendship & love of a labrador named Henry. Henry helped introduce Dale to many of the normal activities & communications most parents take for granted. The special bond between Dale & Henry was heartfelt and humbling.There was a scene described by Nuala early in the book where she was helping her son cross a busy street. Dale dropped Mickey and half- way across the road a massive head-banging, screaming, kicking episode ensued. It was Nuala's description of onlookers reactions that I found apalling and very close to home. I hope that the honesty of people like Nuala, opening her heart and her life, improves public awareness of these 'unseen handicaps'. Maybe the judgemental & ignorant responses such as \"that kid needs a damn good smacking\" & \"Disgusting behaviour\" will be less forthcoming.In this book Nuala pays tribute to Henry, Dale's grandparents, friends & professionals & their incredible efforts to help Dale in his journey. The ultimate reward watching Dale grow to be the compassionate, well-adjusted young man he is today."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna", "userReview": "This was nonfiction about a family who watches their young son pulling away into autism. I liked how this wasn't all about the parents and their trials in learning to deal with the effects that autism had on their life. While it did cover that, it was mostly about their son, Dale. And later they had a daughter, and she too was diagnosed with autism. I loved the parental voice in this. They were not perfect. They didn't try to dismiss their mistakes or make all their successes about how wonderful they were. This felt completely honest and authentic. When their son was young, they brought home a dog and they soon realized how this dog was able to reach Dale in ways they couldn't. It was a touching story about how this dog named Henry, made all the difference in the world.

A Friend Like Henry is about a family's struggle in coping with their son's autism and how a Golden Retriever named Henry changed their lives in ways they couldn't even imagined.I have no experience dealing with autism, neither do I know anyone with autism, but I do know what some of the signs of it are, and reading this novel, I definitely have developed a greater sense of respect for each and every family who has to go through what they do everyday. In this book, Nuala Gardner writes of her joy when she becomes pregnant with her first child and later, of her despair and frustration when her son displays signs of autism. This book is definitely emotional because readers will feel invested in the family's situation. When Nuala was frustrated at the fact that the system wouldn't accept Dale's condition and pretty much placed the blame wholly on Nuala and James (her husband), I felt frustrated too. I cannot imagine what they must have felt like when they were told that they wanted their son to be autistic because they couldn't deal with his slow developmental progress. It would later take them years and the help of friends and family before Dale could get the help and proper diagnosis he required.But in spite of all these adversities, hope came in the form of Henry. I truly believe that Henry was some sort of a guardian angel for Dale. The leaps and bounds Dale made because of Henry was just amazing and to prevent myself from giving anything away, there's all I'm saying. But really, please go read the book. It will give you a renewed hope and who knows, maybe even convince you to get a pet."}, {"userName": "Kalyn", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11718370-kalyn", "userReview": "Nuala Gardner opens up her family to us and shares the joys and sorrows of raising children with Autism.

Henry is their dog who plays a huge role in helping Dale (their son) begin to communicate and interact with people. The writing was kinda not great though. Also, one thing that bothered me about this book is that the mom, Nuala, is constantly trying to figure out how to make her son blend in so that he seems the same as other, non autistic children. This goes so far that she mentions that as late as high school none of his classmates even realize he is autistic. While it's clearly important for Dale to function well in the world, this all seems to me a negative view of autism -- that the \"solution\" is to make him into someone who appears \"normal\" and to hide his autism from others."}, {"userName": "Natalie Williams", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45548675-natalie-williams", "userReview": "Although I really enjoyed this book and it was amazing to see the progress Dale made, I just couldn't give it 5 stars as there were certain parts I felt quite uncomfortable about - particularly in relation to not celebrating diversity and uniqueness and instead his parents essentially encouraging him to 'hide' the fact from his friends that he's autistic!

He is not diagnosed with autism in his early years, and his family struggles to understand him and him, them. They use many methods to deal with his tantrums that arise from little things that sometimes upsets him. Their biggest challenge is to help Dale understand emotions and to move in society as a regular child. When Dale\u2019s family adopts Henry, a golden retriever puppy, quite by chance, it changes Dale\u2019s world. Dale and Henry develop a special bond and it helps the boy to understand emotions and adjust to his life at home and at school. Henry becomes the tool through which Dale learns. \u201c\u2026suddenly here was Henry, the most amazing, living educational resource I had been given to date- and I was certainly going to embrace the opportunities this provided\u201d\u201d(p.135) . The story takes us through the life of Dale and Henry, up until Dale is about fifteen years old. Nuala Gardner, who is also the mother of the main character Dale, wrote this book as an attempt to document her son\u2019s and their family\u2019s journey, and especially to record the amazing progress her son made in life as a child with autism. She may have also written this book as an inspiration and almost a guide for families with autistic children. Another important aspect I see in Mrs.Gardner writing and publishing this story is that it enlightens people about autism and autistic people, who are a widely misunderstood group in society. It is also about the author\u2019s fears for her child and her pain as well. Perhaps she meant for the book to strengthen parents who face similar situations and let them know that they are not alone in their struggles. Nuala Gardner has not demanded change in an aggressive way. However, she does make the reader think and to a large extent change their opinions through the information that she has included in the biographical story. I believe that her intended audience included teenagers to adults. I think that even a 10-12 year old might understand most of the story, but the more complicated aspects of it are probably intended for an older audience. The author of this book is a credible source because it is her own story and her life experience that she has chosen to share with her readers. She has years of experience working with her two autistic children, as well as many families who have consulted her. She is a registered community nurse and a qualified mid wife. She is also an autism consultant who has developed an Autistic Facilitator Dog Program. Her medical background has helped her in dealing with her children who are both Autistic and also helped her in writing about autism through her books. She does not seem to have a particular agenda except education the public about autism. \u2018A friend like Henry\u2019 is story written very sensitively about the connection between an autistic boy and his pet dog. It explores the role of a pet in the life of the boy and how it helped him to identify with human emotions and function in society. Gardner does not seem to have any political goal in her writing except educating people about Autism. I feel that she has succeeded in achieving her goals in reaching out and influencing others. This book appeals to both adults and teenagers because it written in simple honest language. Her message is applicable for anyone who is seeking to understand Autism. Further, the author documents Dale\u2019s life, and uses this story to demonstrate that the connection with a pet is a way of combatting the challenges faced by autistic children. I feel that this is the goal she has most succeeded at achieving, because through the life of her son she shows how he grows up to lead a normal life. At fifteen years old, Dale attends school just like every other child, and no one even knows that he is autistic.It is a very convincing story, even to a person who may have never heard about autism, because it is a real experience written in a beautiful and simple manner. This shows that the author\u2019s purpose was not to create a literary masterpiece, but to educate. This book is useful for anyone, and especially for people who are working with autistic children.Although it doesn\u2019t directly relate to me, I feel that this gives me an idea about identifying and about being sensitive toward others who may be going through similar struggles. It is very useful because there are lots of instances in school when children who are different are misunderstood and bullied. Through books like this, I think that children and teenagers learn a valuable lesson in sensitivity, that not everyone is the same as \u2018me\u2019. I would recommend this story to everyone, because I think it is an important aspect about the people we may meet everyday that Nuala Gardner has written about. The simple way in which the author has written such a difficult story, captures the emotions and feelings of the characters very well. Overall, I think that this is an excellent book and I would give it a rating of five stars because, it is a uniquely written book which combines simplicity and eloquence."}, {"userName": "Martijn Euyen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23765196-martijn-euyen", "userReview": "Ontroerend verslag van een moeder van een zoon die autisme heeft en de rol die Henry de hond in het gezin heeft gespeeld.

Dale was still a baby when his parents realised that something wasn't right. Worried, his mother Nuala took him to see several doctors, before finally hearing the word 'autism' for the first time in a specialist's office. Scared but determined that Dale should live a fulfilling life, Nuala describes her despairat her son's condition, her struggle to prevent Dale being excluded from a 'normal' education and her sense of hopeless isolation. Dale's autism was severe and violent and family life was a daily battleground. But the Gardner's lives were transformed when they welcomed a gorgeous Golden Retriever into the family.
