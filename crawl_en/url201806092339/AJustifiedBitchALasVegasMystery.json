This was definitely an unconventional type of read. This story was just fun and made me feel better about my insanity. That\u2019s right here goes the part where Dani brings her crazy filled life into the story!I have battled a very severe and rare mental illness since the age of 7 that has been an ongoing struggle since then. I am thankfully on a stable dose of medication and am able to function properly as possible but that was not always the case.My illness mostly manifested because of continuous severe traumas I faced for three years as a young child. Like the main character, I lost touch of reality and used different methods to escape and deal with my pain and suffering. These unhealthy \u201ccoping\u201d skills continued into adulthood and will stay with me lifelong.I was given every medication regimen in the book and damaged my liver by young adulthood by medicines doctors have given me. I was put through crazy clinical trials because of having this rare mental illness. I was strapped down to beds for up to 14 hours at a time. I have a messed up disc in my back from caretakers taking me down to \u201cprotect\u201d me. I have received electric shock therapy. I grew up in the system, group homes, residential treatment facilities and mental hospitals.\u00a0By the age of 18, I have been placed in a faciliy of some sort 50 something times.My point to explaining all of this is that I could relate to everything the main character was going through. I knew what it was like to lose touch of reality because the present was too painful to face and the author did a great job of describing the symtoms of how everything feels and works. This book was well written and the descriptions were amazing.Most of the time a book like this may be a trigger for me but not with how the author portrayed Helen. Helen was crazy and it made you laugh.She also was loveable and you could understand why she was the way she was even though she is a suspect. All the other characters were fantastic as well! I loved Jordan and Helen\u2019s two friends that work at the Salon! The way the facility and the medication adjustments were described were a great portrayal of the battle people with psychosis face.\u00a0Helen\u2019s stay and escape from the treatment facility was realistic. Many might be like \u201cthis shit doesn\u2019t happen\u201d, they must have never been institutionalized with a severe mental illness.This book made me laugh and also was very suspenseful. At one moment your laughing at Helen, the next you are having the hairs on the back of your neck stick up because of the intensity of this case. I can\u2019t wait to see what the author has in store for us next!\ud83d\ude04 I highly recommend this book and it is definitely Dani-approved! I hope I was able to explain my review well and hope everyone has a fantastic day!!!

Helen believes she can hear and see Bobby her deceased husband, refuses to bathe and groom herself and lives with a number of cats in squalor. After being taken into custody by the police her sister, Pat turns up and although they have been estranged for years feels a sense of responsibility and guilt for not being around. With help from the detective on the case can Bebe's killer be caught before becomes a target?Easy to read and get into I found this crime thriller interesting as it gave an account of what it's like to be a native of Las Vegas. Helen's eccentricities were a quirky hook in this story and the complexities in her family add another dimension to the thriller. This is quite an even paced read and the characters really grew on me. The supernatural question of whether Bobby is really seen by makes me want to read more in this series."}, {"userName": "Maureen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15138448-maureen", "userReview": "When I first read the book description of \u2018A Justified Bitch\u2019, I was immediately curious about this read. I love mysteries and the fact that this book had a confused main character just spoke to me. So I was super happy when I received the email that I could read and review this book.First of all, I love this cover. I\u2019ve read that most people don\u2019t seem to like this cover, but I seriously love it! I love how the orange grabs your attention, and it just makes me want to start reading. I think it\u2019s a very strong cover, and it was definitely the first thing that made me want to read this book. It\u2019s different, and not like any other cover I\u2019ve seen lately. Definitely a strong starting point for me.Overall I enjoyed reading \u2018A Justified Bitch\u2019. From the moment I started reading, I knew there was something more to this book. The main character Helen Taylor, finds a finger in her back yard right before the police arrives at her neighbors home. Helen\u2019s neighbor is brutally murdered, and it appears Helen might be the only one who has seen something. But the thing is, Helen is talking with her husband.. her dead husband! And Helen doesn\u2019t seem able to give a \u2018normal\u2019 answer. That is the moment Helen\u2019s sister Pat receives a phone call from the police asking for her help. But Pat hasn\u2019t spoken to Helen for years, and she is shocked to find out how Helen\u2019s life has turned out. I loved how mental illness played a huge part in this book. As a nurse, I enjoy reading books where people aren\u2019t all \u2018normal\u2019. Especially since there are so many people with mental illnesses out there. In real life, I do get in contact with people with mental illnesses and I enjoyed reading how Helen coped with her illness. The down part about this book for me, was that I really expected more of a mystery novel than \u2018A Justified Bitch\u2019 really was. I felt like this book was much more about the mental illness part, and the way people react to it then it was a mystery. It wasn\u2019t necessary a bad thing, but I just expected something different. I also felt like this book was a little slow at moments."}, {"userName": "Richard", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7809864-richard", "userReview": "Realistic!\n That is the best description I can provide for this short, easy to read crime novel set in present-day Las Vegas. I received this book free from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for a fair and honest review. It was written (skillfully) by H.G. McKinnis, and published by Flattop Productions, Inc. of Las Vegas in 2017. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is very realistic. The dialogue is believable, and the descriptions of the Las Vegas environment is accurate and colorful. Written in the 3rd person, the book presents the perspectives of the protagonist (Helen), her sister (Cleo, or Pat) and Detective Madison of the Las Vegas Metro Police Department (LVMPD). Even though the author supplies a few hints during the story as to the identity of the killer, we can never be sure, so the element of suspense is present until the end of the book. Helen is a hoarder. She lives on the East Side of Las Vegas, just off Charleston Blvd. Her sister Cleo (or Pat \u2014 short for Cleopatra) lives in Phoenix with her husband and two sons. Helen makes her living buying and selling used merchandise at a swap meet in Las Vegas. She owns her own home, but she became mentally unstable after her husband died in a climbing accident ten years earlier. She still sees her husband, and talks to him every day, even though he is dead. Now, her house is full of trash, cats, insects and other critters, and is not fit to be lived in. Unfortunately, Helen might have witnessed the murder of her next-door neighbor \u2014 a meth-addicted prostitute and telephone sex worker. The murder scene is gruesome, and one of Helen\u2019s cats brings home a body part that police subsequently find in her yard, implicating Helen in the murder. She is jailed as a material witness, and she meets some interesting people, and makes some new friends, while in jail. Helen\u2019 sister and two sons, Jordan and Marc, drive up from Phoenix to bail Helen out of jail and try to help her straighten her life out. That\u2019s when the adventures really begin in earnest. But the murders aren\u2019t over, yet. Another woman is murdered, and Helen does not have an alibi. Police immediately suspect Helen. The conclusion to the story is satisfying. Loose ends are tied up. The story is an easy, fast read. What\u2019s not to like? For a change of pace in murder and crime novels, try this well-written work by H.G. McKinnis. You\u2019ll be glad you did. 5 Stars"}, {"userName": "Linda Zagon", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9286778-linda-zagon", "userReview": "I would like to thank NetGalley and Imbrifex books for an ARC of \"A Justified Bitch\" by H.G. McKinnis for my honest review.The genres of this book are Mystery and Thriller,Suspense, and General Adult Fiction.H.G. McKinnis does an excellent job in describing the devastating effects of mental illness on a family.The story starts when Helen Taylor, finds herself holding a finger and sitting near by her house, where a body has been found murdered next door. Helen lives in a delusional world with her cats and hoarding, and is very comfortable having conversations with her dead husband. When the police question her, she can't explain what she saw. The police take her to jail as a material witness hoping to get information. Helen hasn't showered and her hair is matted. While in jail, she becomes friends with two \"jail mates\" who own a beauty shop.  The police call Helen's sister Pat(Cleo), and ask her to come and try to get Helen to disclose anything pertinent to the case. Helen has not spoken to Pat for over ten years. Pat arrives with her two teen aged boys. She has the key to Helen's house, and when she opens the door she is horrified to see the hoarding conditions that Helen and her cats have been living in. Helen has a place where she goes and sells some of the things that she hoards. Pat goes to buy clothes for her sister and get her out of jail. When she arrives at the jail house, a detective convinces Pat to bring her sister to meet with a Psychiatrist. The Psychiatrist convinces Pat that Helen should stay for at least six weeks and be on medication and counselling . Pat and her two sons are staying at a hotel, and finds that her sons are finding ways to get into trouble. Pat is also trying to get Helen's house in order. Helen finds a way to go AWOL, to get back to her job. While Helen is away from the health center there is another dead body found.  The author describes dsyfunctional, complex and complicated characters. Some of the teenage adventures are funny. The interactions with Pat and her sons is humorous at times. Who is the killer?

Also, for the blog spot to kick off the tour!A JUSTIFIED BITCH by H.G. McKinnis definitely grabbed my attention for two reasons: the title (how can you ignore that?) and the tagline - it takes a guilty bastard to make a justified bitch. Consider me instantly intrigued. I will say, this is a classic example of \"don't judge a book by it's cover\". It does not do the book justice.It all starts with a severed finger is found just a few feet away from the doorstep to Helen Taylor. Most people would panic, not Helen. How come? Well, Helen is already considered crazy - from her hoarder lifestlye, her growing number of cats, and her conversations with her husband. Only thing is that her husband, Bobby, has been dead for years. We find out that the finger is connected to the gruesome murder of her neighbor, Bebe.The police bring Helen in for questioning because they believe she could be a witness to the crime, or a possible suspect. While in custody, the detective calls up her sister, Pat, who currently lives down in Phoenix. She comes to her sister's aid with her two teenage sons. Upon her arrival to the police station, detectives convince her to have Helen brought into a mental facility to be evaluated. After seeing the conditions her sister was living in, she felt she had no choice and that its what was best for her.Helen goes AWOL from the facility, and shortly after she escapes another gruesome murder occurs. Will the detectives, Pat, and her sons be able to solve the case and find Helen? In order to do so, they need to find the truth in the insanity.This book definitely surprised me! I wasn't expecting such a gripping mystery (based on the title). I was anticipating more of a journey of revenge (again, based on the title). The characters were so well-developed and diving into the mind of Helen was quite the ride! The hoarding, the cats, and her dealing with the grief of her husband's death 10 years prior. I was drawn in from the start and McKinnis didn't let go until the very end - I'm excited and hoping for a book two in the Las Vegas Mysteries series!If you want a great murder mystery with a character that makes you feel almost as insane as she is, then this is the one for you!I give this one 4.5/5 stars!"}, {"userName": "Chandra Claypool (wherethereadergrows)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9722719-chandra-claypool-wherethereadergrows", "userReview": "Helen is a bit of an eccentric hoarder.

A severed finger is found near her home but she's not bothered. Nothing really gets to Helen these days. However, she becomes a suspect and has to spend a night in jail. Then another murder occurs and she has a tie to this person as well - with no alibi. Her family comes up to try and help her but how do you properly help someone who lives in her own little world?OK - first of all, I love the title of this book but it doesn't quite fit with the story line. I assumed it would be more of a tag line for a story of vengeance. Don't judge this book by the cover or title. Cleverly written, we get a look into the perspective of a person with hoarding issues. Have you ever seen the show, Hoarders? I have and am always fascinated by these people's stories. People are so quick to judge, but these are real issues stemming from something and they can get help. But back to the book - this was an easy page turner.

She was cut up and one of her body parts ended up in Helen\u2019s yard. Police are trying to question Helen but aren\u2019t getting very far. The reason is because Helen has a mental illness. She cracked when her husband, Bobby died. As a matter of fact she talks to Bobby all the time. Enter her well to do sister with her 2 sons trying to clean up this mess. While Helen is in jail she meets 2 hairdressers and they become friends. In order to keep Helen safe the lead detective talks Pat into putting Helen in a facility that caters to this disease. Helen escapes and another murder happens so of course since Helen is the only thing that ties these 2 murders together of course all fingers point to Helen while her sister Pat is trying to prove her innocence.

We start off a little awkwardly by viewing the world through the eyes of Helen, named after Helen of Troy. It is so confusing at the start until you understand that the person she is having a conversation with is her dead husband Bobby. Then we are confronted with a pet dropping a gift of love at Helens feet \u2013 a severed finger complete with French manicure. Turns out that Bebe, her next door neighbour / prostitute has been brutally murdered and Helen appears to be the only witness. Helens sister Pat (named Cleopatra after another renowned beauty in history) arrives in Las Vegas via Arizona to try and help the police to get Helen to talk. Which proves to be a challenge as Helen is living in a world of her own. The course of the book takes place over several days. Helen is a filthy recluse and a hoarder and has actual conversations with her husband which tends to throw people for a loop. Pat is the sister who feels that she abandoned her sister when things really started to go badly for her. She couldn\u2019t cope with her sister\u2019s mental breakdown and feels a great deal of guilt for it and wants to do the right thing by her. But the underlying question is, despite her mental instability, is Helen a murderer? There are other players in this story, such as Pat\u2019s two teenage sons who get up to their fair share of mischief in the city of sin and the smart detective who manages to keep all the strings to this mystery in hand as they untangle and it ends with a satisfying crescendo.  I loved the pacing of this book. There were no dead pockets of story that felt like filler. The characters are relatable and sympathetic and personally likable although at the start when Helen is at her sickest she is not so visibly attractive. The story unravels until the end all and the time I was wondering the significance of the title which reveals itself at the very end \u2013 and it\u2019s worth waiting for.A great cosy thriller.

Nevertheless, the author knows how to spin a fairly good yarn and much of it makes for a compelling read. I think that the novel is at its best when it gives Helen's point of view. Helen is a hoarder extraordinaire with all the junk and many cats and who has a running dialogue with her dead husband, Bobby, as if he were sitting on her shoulder. The confusion and distraction and misunderstandings that flow from Helen's mental difficulties, especially her talking to her late husband, make this story.

When a severed finger arrives on her doorstep Helen is thrown into the middle of a murder investigation and suddenly her whole life is being examined. She spends her days with her ever growing population of cats, talking to her dead husband, and hoarding things. The detective in charge of the case is convinced Helen knows something, but Helen can't remember what she saw!The police fear she is the only witness so she is taken into custody so they can get her to get some medical help and to keep her safe whilst they try to figure out who butchered her neighbour.After the detective and psychiatric doctor evaluate her, her sister, Pat Henderson, drives up from Phoenix with teenaged sons in tow to care for Helen and help the police. Pat hasn\u2019t seen her sister in years and is shocked at how bad her life has become since Bobby\u2019s death ten years ago, the conditions Helen has been living in and she feels like she owes it to her sister to stay and help take care of her.As the police delve deeper into the murder, they start to wonder if the reason Helen isn\u2019t saying anything is because, not only did she see what happened, but she was involved so the underlying question is, despite her mental instability, is Helen a murderer?The story revolves around both a detective mystery and a mental institution which gives it a nice change of pace having the story split between different settings and themes.The look into mental illness shows not just what Helen is going through, but how it affects her family, friends, the medical profession and the community. I thoroughly enjoyed the narrative of their family relationships, estranged and renewed, as well as Helen's own narrative through mental illness. This was a fun easy read with a bit of a mystery at its core, better than i expected which is always a win for books that exceed expectations."}, {"userName": "Reader Views", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48888810-reader-views", "userReview": "Reviewed by Anna Riley for Reader Views (10/17)As in the words of the Talking Heads, \u201cPsycho killer, Qu\u2019est-ce que c\u2019est?\u201d author H.G. McKinnis captures readers in her debut novel, \u201cA Justified Bitch\u201d with quirky Helen Taylor. Helen speaks to her dead husband, has lots of cats, and sells \u201cantiques\u201d at a jockey lot, looking like a straight-out demented serial killer. When murder erupts in Helen\u2019s sordid neighborhood the only question is did she do it?McKinnis does a clever job of combing wit, suspense, charm, and family trials delivering a fast paced read with heart. Readers follow along like a fly on the wall as Helen, Cleo, and Detective Madison deal with obstacles as they occur after one of crazy Helen\u2019s cats brings her neighbors severed finger to her doorstep. The whole book is a thrill ride that will tug at your heart strings. The entire time I felt entranced with Helen\u2019s wit and ease of being completely comfortable with talking to her dead husband on the streets, and with those she met. Even more so I loved how her new friends played along like they could see him as well. Who knows maybe Bobby was really there? I also loved how Helen viewed people, for instance, \u201cher new friend who looked like a green M&M.\u201d Every character has depth and personality, even the minor characters in the book, which causes readers to become attached to each one. I was guessing till the end whether or not Helen did it, and she was as well!\u201cA Justified Bitch\u201d by H.G. McKinnis is great for teens, adults, and anyone who wants a great read on a lazy Sunday afternoon. It\u2019s also great for those who love to solve the mystery before the book ends. It took a different twist than I expected, so good luck to you sleuths out there! I also learned a new perspective on mental health in this book. Crazy isn\u2019t always as it seems. I really enjoyed this story and would love to hear from Helen and her family again, and see where their life has taken them."}, {"userName": "Jan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3882338-jan", "userReview": "Some days can turn into a real nightmare, especially when your neighbor is dismembered more or less under your eyes. Of course, it's difficult to sort things out when you talk with your dead husband, have way too many cats, and a hoarding problem.Helen Taylor is Det. Jake Madison's closest thing to a witness, but hardly a reliable one. She exists mostly in a dream world. Bebe, the victim, was extraordinary too - a whore past her prime, gardener, whose new profession provided phone sex.Pat Henderson, Helen's sister, drives up from Phoenix with teenaged sons in tow to care for Helen and help the police. A complicated history and family life already have Pat at DefCon 3; Helen's disappearances and reappearances, almost put her over the edge. An urban cowboy detective, a swap meet business, flashy gay hairdressers, and another horrific murder move the story along. If you like good characters, an interesting mystery, and the loyalty and conflicts of siblings, you'll enjoy A Justified Bitch. The title is accurate but does not indicate language issues for readers who don't enjoy coarse language.

I was a little worried on which one to pick, but when i seen \"Bitch\" in the title, I thought \"That has to be the one\"!! How could that not catch your eye, right?!This book was refreshingly different than most books i have read lately! It's not the serious action packed thriller mystery you might be expecting. I was actually relieved when it turned out to be funny! It was almost like Okay i can take a breath, relax, and just enjoy the book. The first half of the book is hilarious, an eccentric hoarding cat lady is not quite sure if she witnessed the hooker's next door murder or not. She's not stupid she remembers things, but sometimes She doesn't remember what she remembers! Between laughing about the flirty cop, her jealous dead husband & the night she spent in jail, somehow you get drawn into this deeper heartfelt story where you can always count on Family to be there when you need them! Surprisingly enough it's actually the teenage boys that pull you in and make you want to understand more about Helen, her condition, and the crazy roller coaster ride that is her life.This book gives you all the feels a great book should dish out, from laughing one minute, shedding a few tears the next (Darn you Marc and that picture box!), joy when you see everything coming together to get Helen into her home, and of course the best part of all, the mystery and suspense of figuring out who the killer is!  Will you know who it is before it's over? Only one way to find out!!"}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49650416-elizabeth", "userReview": "I agree with some reviewers not to judge this book by it's cover, title, or even its first chapter. At first I was like \"what is going on with this Helen girl\" and was somewhat rolling my eyes. Then I started reading more and got hooked when her sister, Pat/Cleo, was introduced.This book was a very interesting and fast read for me. VERY unexpected, but I really enjoyed it. I read this on a Saturday/Sunday and just flew through the book 100 pages at a time.This story revolves around both a detective mystery and a mental institution. It was a nice change of pace when the story split between different settings and themes (though all very intertwined and not random). I was hooked and wanted to learn more about what happened, what would come of Helen, and how the entire plot would play out.The character development is well done. I felt really tied to most of the main and secondary characters. McKinnis did a great job making you feel connected to them - I felt like I knew them and what they were about. Very entertaining read - highly recommend!

Helen sees things but she is not stupid. Helen forgets things but not important things. Helen's infamous hooker neighbor was dismembered and the detective on the case wants to know if she and her deceased husband Bobby saw anything. I loved Helen and her quirky friends and family. I thought the characters all had a great dynamic and likeability to them. The mystery aspect made the story fun, although it was not a thriller page-turner it had an element of surprise and the characters won me over so efficiently I had an incredibly hard time putting the book down so I read it in 3 sittings. I would gladly read any other arcs by H.G. McKinnis!I was not sure how the cover actually fit in with the story. I would love some enlightenment to this as Helen always appeared to be so dirty...

There is a finger found on the property of a hoarding cat lady. When asked about the finger by the police, Helen, really doesn't seem to make much sense. Alice is constantly talking to Bobby, her dead husband. The police place Helen in a mental facility and call her sister from Phoenix. Pat arrives with her two boys, and try to help the police understand Helen. But Pat and Helen really are not close, so Pat isn't really sure what Helen is talking about. Then Helen leaves the hospital, and another murder is committed. Is Helen a murderer? Can Pat and the police figure out exactly what Helen was talking about and sort out the truth from her imagination? This story is very well written and shows us how people with mental illness think and are looked at by others. It also shows how family members react to members with this problem. A job well done.

I enjoyed reading about Helen Andover family and trying to understand how she fit into the mystery of Bebe's murder. It was sad to read about the estrangement of her sister, Pat & family. Mental illness plagues Helen, and it doesn't help that she lost her husband, Bobby, in a tragic accident. The story tragedies chronicled the tied that bind family, and the complexity of mental illness. Critical notes: the murder of Dr. Urban was not explained at all. Lots of red herrings, but the real killer was almost instantly obvious. One major issue I hard was with the editing. Like the character Tiny - halfway through the book, he's referred to as Tiny Jackson, but on the very next page, Tiny Davis. That's just sloppy and distracting. Overall, I enjoyed this book.

It reminded me of some of the funnier and unique work by Janet Evanovich. The book contains a bit of everything that you would expect in a well-written novel; and some ingredients that you might not predict. I am familiar with the Las Vegas, where this takes place. However, until reading A Justified Bitch I was not cognizant of the subtle mental care aspects of Sin City. The writer has given us a different and interesting take on the genre, one that is most welcome.
