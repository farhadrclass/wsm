I might have expected too much as I assumed it would be about the Wild West when the book was not about that at all. I also expected more about Custer getting massacred and the Centennial of the US but that was just messed in passing."}, {"userName": "Thom Swennes", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3690472-thom-swennes", "userReview": "The Civil War is over and a country once again united tries to heal the wounds of war and recover. Westward migration and expansion is helped by the improved means of transportation through both roads and railways. The industrial revolution is gathering steam and the changing economical and social situation brings new problems hitherto unknown. The Kent family splits, one heading west to new and yet untame territories. Another Kent returns to where it all began bringing the epoch full circle. One stays and continues as the family had begun and fulfilling the family motto. The three sons of Jephtha Kent have chosen their ways and don\u2019t look back. The Lawless is volume VII of the Kent Family Chronicles and continues this epic tale of America. The rich and powerful, poor and destitute all make their mark in a country destined for greatness. This is a great book in even greater series depicting a country\u2019s struggle from independence, through expansion and finally greatness. I am both impressed and pleased how John Jakes manages to place small tidbits and trivia of seemingly unrelated subjects and events into his manuscripts. It makes the reading of his works both a learning and enjoyable experience. I recommend this book to everyone as it also has all the elements of greatness."}, {"userName": "Marilyn", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1844330-marilyn", "userReview": "Book 7 of 8 of the Kent Family Chronicles brings us full force into the labor union issues of the 1870's. Lots of horrors of those days we can't even begin to imagine. Gideon Kent, oldest son of Jephtha, great grandson of the original Philip Kent, has moved from a one sheet union rag to reporter/publisher of the family New York Union newspaper, in the hopes that he can make his mark in helping American labormen with wage/compensation issues. In reporting on union issues he always sends himself to do the reporting on strikes and current matters. On one of these trips to Chicago he tangles with the W&B Railroad President/founder. The man is simply evil...disguised in the wolves clothing of religion (disgusting beyond all comprehension). Because of the tangle, Courtleigh has vowed to destroy Gideon, his family, and his mistress. Because of pressing railroad business, strikes, and just life in general Courtleigh's efforts come and go...allowing Gideon time to ease off...and then not be watchful...which is never a good thing.  A good book. I enjoyed it. It had some horrors, but nothing like book #3."}, {"userName": "Denise", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2888838-denise", "userReview": "I believe this book (#7 in the series) is the best one yet. It exposes the reader to the strain of Gideon's family life, his unrequited love for Julia, and his struggle to become a \"self-made\" man. Gideon wasn't much of a student in his childhood and he finds he must work harder in his adult life to obtain the skills necessary to join the family publishing company. A reader can feel the pain of his wife's alcohol addiction along with the emotional withdrawal of his children. A hateful foe stalks his family. He has left the love of his life (Julia).

While I liked the continuation of the family name through each generation, I could have done without every single important female of the Kent family being raped, sometimes repeatedly. They no sooner got power and money than they lost it, and family members ran the gamut from good to brilliant to corrupt to sleazy to fierce to insane to bloodthirsty. Lots of historical info, also, which made the story more real and interesting.

And I remember I really liked them. On the pre-test for American History I aced it, got the highest in the whole school, and I credit it all to these books. They are a great way to learn American History. I found the whole series at a yard sale this summer, and bought them, excited to read them again. But they weren't as good the second time.

Gideon and Matt have taken very different paths of a railroad man and a painter. Jeremiah has \u201cdisappeared\u201d and is feared to have been a casualty during the war by his family; in reality he has survived, taken a different name and is wandering the West making a living by hunting and gambling. On the other side of the Kent family, Louis has died leaving only Carter and his ex-wife, Julia. Julia is a strong independent woman who has gotten involved in the women\u2019s movement and is touring giving lectures about suffrage. Meanwhile, Michael Boyle is building the first coast-to-coast railroad and finding his way. Each member of the family offers insight into a historic part of American history, including all the difficulties and beautiful successes. The 7th book in this series, this novel covers a wide variety of historic topics from unionism, railroads, big bosses, and the Impressionist movement. It is probably one of my favorite books within this series \u2013 it covers such an interesting time period with such a varied grouping of characters. Well-written and developed it is a pleasure to read and the pages go by very quickly!

Gideon becomes a labor activist, seeking the organization of unions and a better life for the employees. But this is also the time of the \"Bosses\" in Chicago and they will do everything in their power to strike down any union activity. Jeremiah goes out West and makes a name for himself as a gunslinger. Actually he has to change his name several times to keep from getting caught by the law. The Kent family believes that Jeremiah was killed in the War. Matt goes to Paris to continue his artist profession. He swears he will never return to America. There is something to be learned in reading the stories of these 3 brothers. John Jakes does immense research while writing these books and you learn about the history of America through the lives of the Kent family.

All books are narrated by Marc Vietor. The entire series is approximately 125 hours of listening. Shortest book is 15.5 hours, longest over 26 hours. Vietor does a good job with narration, although the uniqueness of male voices is problematic. Most significant, you\u2019ll have little difficulty determining who-says-what-to-who. Tempo and pacing fine, albeit the narration is a bit slow for my taste, bumped it to 1.25.The entire series is a broad spectrum history of the United States from just pre-Revolutionary War through the 1890s and a chronicle of the Kent family through this time. Beginning with Phillip through the generations to the children of Gideon, a great-great-grandson. Members of the clan fight in the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Civil War, are at the Alamo, the California Gold Rush, the Great Chicago Fire, the Johnstown Flood, and much more. The author skillfully intersperses vignettes of imagined and factual history. For example, two of the fictional characters of the series are sheltered for a few days at the home of the Lincolns in rural Kentucky - a baby is part of the family, young Abraham. One of the fictional characters is counseled by Benjamin Franklin. Fiction, Phillip\u2019s childhood friend is Marquis deLafayette, non-fiction: deLafayette\u2019s role in United States and French military. The series is rife with this type of paradigm, but it is not difficult to determine what is true and what is fiction. All the instances that involve the Kents and John Jake\u2019s other fictional characters are products of his imagination. Much of the rest is a fun methodology of conveying historical events.The stories are very listenable. I found no need to re-wind or fast-forward; no segment boring or irrelevant. Theses books are not \u2018love stories\u2019 in the typical sense, albeit familial relationships, the crux of The Kent Family Chronicles, must include love stories, n'est-ce pas? In those areas where a sexual encounter is defined it is relevant to the plot and tastefully written. This does not occur often, but the clan does proliferate :-). A word to the prudish: there are a couple of rapes vividly described.Very typical of the time written, the 1970s, writing is a bit verbose. Several of these books were adapted for television mini-series, popular at the time.John Jakes is a terrific historical fiction author, recommended.

Post-Civil War.Oh, the Kent family. They're like the Forest Gump of literature: anything big that happened in history, they were there; anyone famous in history, they knew. But I do love them.Book 7, like all the other books in the series, is a book of trials and tribulations, the little guy fighting for what he believes in, striving to make oneself better, and heartbreak -- both romantic, personal, and professional. The patriarch of the family is now Gideon Kent, 5 generations from where we started so long ago, back in France with Phillipe Charboneau, a.k.a. Philip Kent. Gideon fights for the rights of laborers, which brings ire from big business. Gideon's brother Matt is off in Europe, living his dream of being an artist, while their other brother, Jeremiah, is thought to be dead as a result of the Civil War.

The Lawless is well titled as this installment of the Kent Family Chronicles seems to have more violence, certainly more brutal, lawless violence. It tracks the stories of Jephtha Kent's three sons: Gideon, the newspaper publisher fighting for union rights; Matt, the tortured artist living in France; and Jeremiah, roaming the wild west under various assumed names. Jeremiah is thought dead by his family, disenchanted Matt refuses to return to America, and Gideon's marriage is falling apart.

The story takes place in the 15 years following the Civil War. It starts out with Matthew in Paris. He is the artist who won't change his views to be with his girlfriend and son. Most of the book deals with Gideon and his horrible marriage with Margaret. I felt sorry for Gideon with all he had to deal with due to Margaret's insanity. Don't get me wrong, Gideon didn't handle things the way he should have but I couldn't attack him too much based on his homelife.Gideon also had to deal with Tom Courtleigh who has vowed revenge on Gideon and his family following a confrontation.
