My first thought upon receiving this book was that it reminded me of Beetlejuice's Book of The Recently Deceased ha!!The author did a hilarious pain staking job of creating a \"post-lifer\" world where everything has been redefined or reconfigured to meet the needs of an ever decaying and growing zombie populace. Murphy covers everything from Etiquette to medical help, from fashion to hygiene, from exercise to sex, nothing is left out and is explained with an empathetic comical tone very much in the vain of the self help 'Dummy' books complete with side notes, other mentionables, post lifer recipes, and even recommended viewing on movies and TV!A lot of reiteration but since the book is targeting the recently turned, I get the reasoning for the reiteration even if it does feel a bit like a cop out. I found that some of the parts that were suppose to be funny fell flat due to the fact that much of it was nonsensical in it's delivery. I get that there will be puns in a book that screams puns, and those weren't a problem (in fact the no duh puns used were quite funny). It was the random mentioning of something silly when explaining something unrelated... My Biggest complaint is the author's use of pop culture references when trying to make a joke. I have not heard of a lot of the people he mentions, and there for, the redundant \"Doing this is like being ___insert name of person here, at a grocery store...\" A lot of the references were stated this way and yes become obnoxious.I love the chapter on the foods and alcohol. what not to eat and what to consume, and don't worry if your an alcoholic, there's a drink suggestion in here for you two! The book really does cover damn near every aspect of becoming a zombie and how to function as such in a human world. The reminders the author gives to the reader to read faster before the brain deteriorates is humorous. For as quickly as the writer wants you to read the book, he does drag on points longer than needed and the reiteration again become tiresome and some of the points gave me the feeling that zombies would have a very difficult time digesting that kinda of information given the decaying nature of their minds. The author is very sympathetic to those Transitioning and does a great job at providing products, advice and tips for all sorts of people and lifestyles. The names of the beauty products were clever and the company name Graybelline gotta smile out of me and PETZ (People for the ethical treatment of zombies) was another clever little twist on an established organization.The engaging interruptions of messages from sponsors or little short stories to give you a taste of what you are dealing with are fun little commercial like parts of the book and all in all the author offers up an exceptional guide to the newly bitten."}, {"userName": "Brendan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/344179-brendan", "userReview": "I got Zombies for Zombies as a Christmas gift and enjoyed it moderately. Best read in short bursts, the book comes from a post-zombie apocalypse future in which some zombies (who make a strong effort early on) are able to keep roughly 30% of their brain function, allowing them to remain civilized. The book focuses on people who have been bitten and are undergoing The Transition. It's chock full of advice about how to survive with as much brain function as possible. Some thoughts: * It's funny, but only mildly so. As I said above, the book works best in short bursts because its humor is pretty steady--thus a sustained reading of a lot of it gets repetitive. * Murphy replicates the self-help genre perfectly. The book is chock full of product placement and trademarked products for zombies. The world implied by the descriptions (with things like \"costs fewer stamps\") is a dark and creepy world. In some ways, it's a glimpse of what marketing people would do after the apocalypse--pretend that it hadn't happened. * For the zombies who maintain brain function, the book spends a lot of time explaining their social lives and potential. The chapters on zombie sex are just plain wrong. WRONG.Worth perusing, but I probably wouldn't recommend buying it. Zen of Zombie is funnier and probably less expensive."}, {"userName": "Patrick D'Orazio", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4328815-patrick-d-orazio", "userReview": "So you've just been bitten by a zombie and are about to change into one yourself? Well, fear not, you don't have to go all horde-y and go on a brain munchin' spree. Instead, you can read this detailed how-to book for the recently bitten as they prepare for their transition into post-life. David Murphy has created a zombieverse where most of the undead go all runny in the head and turn into the horde, which are your traditional flesh and brain eaters. But I believe the percentage is around 18% that work hard to retain at least some of their humanity...at least enough that they are elligible to live in one of the Scarlet Shores facilities that have been built near the barricaded areas where the horde resides. There, these post-lifers get the opportunity to socialize with others of their kind, get quality meds that keep them happy with their diminished abilities, and overall, a chance to un-live as much of a normal un-life as possible. This book was funny and a highly detailed step by step program to adjust to your new rotting existence by the author. The illustrations were top-notch and the book was pretty entertaining overall. I think I liked the two interludes that consisted of short stories even better than the chapter by chapter overview on how to prepare for your transition. I am not sure if David has done other short stories but I think if he compiles some more involving the horde I would like to check them out. The author keeps a snarky edge through out this book and while I have to admit that not all of his humor hit the mark, overall Z4Z was quite entertaining. If you can appreciate zombie humor or plan on getting bitten by the living dead any time soon, this is probably not a bad book to add to your collection."}, {"userName": "Toby", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1268679-toby", "userReview": "Zombies for Zombies is a spoof of the \"...for Dummies\" series of books, with various pop culture references to everything from Night of the Living Dead to Scarface. Even Steven Covey's \"7 Habits of Highly Successfull People\" can't escape the satire of this book, and is riffed on suitably in the chapter \"14 Habits of Highly Successful Zombies\". So you've been bitten by a zombie huh? And you don't know what to expect? Afraid of turning into just another member of the mindless horde? Well this is the right book for you! Starting out with an explanation of how the virus will affect you, then progressing through other matters of importance to the post-lifers, Zombies for Zombies is the ultimate self-help book for the recently infected. Within these pages you will learn how to prevent yourself turning Horder, and learn all you need to know about post-life religion, exercise, cuisine, sex, and fashion! Learn about the government constructed Scarlet Shores resorts (only open to post-lifers who have completed the Z4Z course), and the huge array of wonderful commercial drugs that will now become your best friend (Thank you Quali-Co!)All in all Zombies for Zombies was a fun read and mimicked the overly friendly and patronising style of the For Dummies series perfectly. A great book for a zombie fanatic, anyone who has ever read a For Dummies book, or anyone with a good sense of humour! NB: Due to descriptions and diagrams of sexual nature this is not recommended for the young 'uns ;)"}, {"userName": "Hildur", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4193760-hildur", "userReview": "If you have an interest in zombies (why would you be reading this book otherwise?) then this is a really fun and easy read for you.The book was very on point and humorous with some cool, new theories that I really liked, for instance about the zombie \"virus\" not really being a virus, but a prion and therefore uncureable.The splitting of the zombies into classes was also pretty cool. The bad ones of course being \"the horde\" and the good ones (what the book wants you to want to be), \"the post-lifers\".It's a book that talks about sides of zombies you have never heard of (for instance there's a whole chapter about zombie sex called \"the coma sutra\") so it keeps you quite excited about learning more, but the reason why it doesn't get more stars from me is because around chapter ten and onwards it starts getting a bit tedious and uninteresting. Around that time I couldn't wait for it to end, which is very sad since I'd enjoyed the book so much up to that point.There were some zombie recipes in appendix of the book which were an interesting concept but kind of a waste of space. I wish he had just left the last parts of the book out.But would I recommend you read Zombies for Zombies? YES! I had a lot of giggles while reading this book. It's really fun and it takes very little time to read so you should definitely make the effort to do so."}, {"userName": "Anna", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/851151-anna", "userReview": "Zombie for Zombies is a how-to-book and advice book, to living as a Zombie. A must for anyone who has been recently bitten. I'll be the first to admit I'm not a huge zombie fan. But if you add in a bit of snark, a little bit of humor then I'm good to go. Which is exactly what I found in Zombies for Zombies, I thought it was hilarious! This book holds all sorts of information that is vital to a zombie. From behavior, to grooming, stories of success and even tips to spice up your zombie sex life. Not to be missed!

Bummer.\u201d Zombies for Zombies is a parody of the popular \u201cfor dummies\u201d books. This time, zombies are the target audience. In the world of the book, zombies are capable of retaining some sort of intelligence if steps are taken at the very beginning of the transformation. This book aims at helping the newly minted keep their brains about them. Each chapter focuses on many different topics, such as how to dress as a zombie, fitness ideas, how to overcome the dreaded zombie stigma and even how to enjoy the \u2018kama sutra\u2019. Also included are actual brain recipes that should make any hungry reader salivate. Tossed among the pages are quirky quizzes and humorous illustrations that add a bit of snark to the text.The author writes in a real tongue-and-cheek fashion which will have any zombie fan laughing out loud. The book is clever, and not overly gory in details, so even the most light-hearted zombie enthusiast could read this book over breakfast. Okay, if they\u2019re squeamish maybe they should skip the brain recipes. All in all, this book is an entertaining addition to the many zombie books shuffling into the genre. Besides, if a reader actually becomes a zombie, this book could very well save not their lives (they are undead after all) but their wits during the whole transition period. Readers who like this might also try the newest addition to this series titled Zombies for Zombies: The Play and Werk Buk: The World\u2019s Best Selling Guide for the Living Dead.

It's premise is very simple - it's a self-help book for the recently turned zombie as he/she prepares for life as the undead.
