Four flashes of light erupt, and from them emerge the unmistakable shapes of incredible beasts: a wolf, a leopard, a panda, a falcon.

(Note: Due to copy-and-paste, formatting and most links have been lost.)Talk about creative! My brother and I've both been big fans of Scholastic's multi-author series, and this one, Spirit Animals, is no exceptions. Let's have my ten-year-old brother take it away first:Roark: This book was just so... COOL. The main characters got the Fallen Four spirit animals, which is so cool. They each had better spirit animals than other people, which is really interesting because they must be awesome to have such cool spirit animals. I also really liked the plot because it tells you a lot about the spirit animals world, which is very fascinating**. It is also good because it switches from person to person so I can get more information from different places.I think the characters are awesome**. Conor learned how to use his spirit animal faster than everyone else, which was cool. Abeke was the first to learn how to turn the spirit animal into a tattoo. They're all smart, maybe not like Meilin but, while Meilin is the best fighter which is cool because she's a girl [my sister is really good at Kung Fu but my friends don't believe me because she's a girl]***, everyone else can fight well in their own awesome way. Rollan, lastly, is my favorite because he is so funny.Overall, I give this a 5 out of 5.Me: Since I'm just a tad above the targeted age range and the complete opposite of my brother, I can't sing praises for Wild Born without a few (or, I suppose, one really big) reservation(s).First off, though: Brandon Mull is excellent at world-building. I found it fascinating how he managed to twist four cultures into a cocktail of a world that, though anachronistic, surprisingly retained many of the elements of each culture when it would've been much easier to neglect their foundations. I enjoyed running on a South America-like street with Rollan, being pampered (ephemerally) in an Asian palace with Meilin (Since I'm Asian, the discrepancies in the Asian worldbuilding stood out to me more than the other ones did; still, it is a commendable effort on Mull's part to make it as reminiscent of Asia as possible without compromising the story's overarching world), shake with terror in a Medieval England-esque surrounding alongside Conor, and hunt through wild forests with Abeke that brings images of Native American tribes to the mind.Yet where he excels, I also reluctantly found fault. Mull's writing is... dull. Quite dull.It feels plain, especially in the first few chapters, full of telling and detached emotion. It is only after about 50 pages in that I really began to see the characters for who they were. Even then, oftentimes I found myself not exactly enthused--though certainly not unwilling--to dive back into the Spirit Animals world because something about the writing just didn't necessarily captivate me. It missed a spark; a touch of something magical, to fit in rightly with its exquisite world.Still, I didn't care much about the writing's obtuseness after a while because the action and any scene, really, was just so entertaining. The characters were written exceptionally well in regards to their authenticity. I saw a lot of myself in Meilin, and laughed far too loudly at Rollan, and I could appreciate the humbleness of Conor just as well as I admired Abeke for her bravery. Each character could hold their own, and because of that and the excellent world-building, even with the writing being flat, the plot never ran too slowly.The verdict? If you stick with the book through its rough beginning, you'll likely find yourself flipping the pages quickly--and if not quickly, then at least satisfactorily. After all, it's not every day you get a middle grade that mashes all the charming bits of the age group together in quite the inventive and ambitious tale. Besides, the spirit animals are, as my brother would say it... SO COOL.*I received an ARC copy provided by the publisher in an exchange for an honest review. No monetary or otherwise beneficial supplement was exchanged.**He didn't actually say that. He said cool. I had to change his vocabulary up, I'm sorry. T.T***He didn't include this in the actual review that he handed me, but he had mentioned it to me before and I thought it was a very valid point. ^.^Oh! Before y'all ditch this post--Scholastic is doing this cool (GAH! Now I'm turning into my brother!) thing where you can actually play an online game set in the Spirit Animals world hand have your own Spirit Animal. I think it's very innovative, and you should totally check it out here."}, {"userName": "Lazybee", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19638596-lazybee", "userReview": "I am a fan of brandon mull.

everything going for it in terms of marketing: famous children's/YA authors, slick site, fast release schedule, corresponding computer game. Although I wasn't thrilled with the 39 Clues series, this sounded like something my kids would like, so I requested them from our library.But the series just doesn't have any pull - for me OR my kids. Aside from the fact that the whole series structure seems gimmicky (it never feels right when it is a publisher's idea instead of an author's), the story just didn't have any heart or spark. It's strange, but I can't quite put my finger on where the story is lacking. The characters all have some cool nuances to them, and their different relationships with their spirit animals are done well. But I had to force myself to keep reading it to the end, and even my bookworm oldest child only finished the book because I wouldn't let her play the game otherwise. My second child didn't finish it at all, and books 2 & 3 in the series got returned to the library unread.

I didn't like his last book, and I'd never have picked this one up if two of my favourite authors weren't writing the next two books in the series. So what happens in the first three chapters? A boy who shows no spark of predator summons a Wolf. A girl who can catch prey during the drought (her logic seems sound) is told off by her Dad for plot purposes, apparently, because in a real drought you don't have that sort of luxury, then summons something else. A Chinese girl summons a panda. War breaks out while she's doing it. It's too disjointedly written to read.All the animals have vibrant blue and purple eyes and should have been sorted into Sparklypoo.And the Chinese girl who has spent enough time at 11 years old to have perfected make-up techniques beyond those of her professional servants? Is Secretly Super Skilled at hand to hand fighting since she was five and nobody knows. \"All in secret\" she learned to use every weapon and \"a scant six weeks past her eleventh birthday, she could outmanouver all but the greatest masters.\"You know what learning to fight that well is? Ceaseless training. Not done in secret, because it is done and tested fucking constantly. Presenting it as a 'secret' is disrespectful to every child who bothers to put in a thousand hours of sweat and effort to get what they want.And then I stopped. Flipping to the next chapter shows yet another goddamn pov switch with yet another - you guessed it! - kid going to adopt another magical sparklypoo animal. I'm betting all our pov characters are going to be on the same side which is the side of Good. And the bad guys are going to have no motivations whatsoever other than to be Bad.I can see what they are going for. Well written, this could all be overlooked. But it isn't well written. Things are hollow, shallow, and boring. This could have been much more.

I was really disappointed in this book, I bought it at my kids' school book fair because, one it was by Brandon Mull, I thought it was his new series and not some one time thing, and two my son asked for it, it was the hot item at the book fair. I think the only reason every kid wanted it was because they promoted it so much in a scholastic infomercial that they showed every kid during their library time and played the commercial over and over on the TV within the book fair. I bought it in the fall and my son hasn't even finished it yet, it won't hold his attention and I had to talk myself into finishing it.

It moves at a quick pace, getting to the meat of the story within a few pages with a surprising depth considering the shortness of the book. The four main characters are fun to get to know, each one with their strengths and weaknesses. Conor, who comes from a sheep-herding family is shocked when he bonds with a wolf. He is even further stunned when he discovers that it isn't just a wolf, but Briggan, a Great Beast, who'd fallen in battle long before. But when he finds out that he is needed to help defend his country his lack of confidence doesn't stop him from doing the right thing.Akebe, who bonds instantly with Uzara, the leopard, finds herself far from home, training for what she doesn't know. Her hunting instincts allow her to quickly develop a close relationship with the leopard, which is good because she finds herself fighting for her life on a regular basis. But her loyalties are immediately put to the test when she comes face to face with the other three and their spirit animals, and discovers they are fighting for the side she thought was the enemy.Meilin has trained as a fighter most of her life and is stunned when her city is invaded and she is forced to flee with Jhi, her giant panda spirit animal. But her fighting spirit seems to be at odds with the gentle creature she is bonded with and it causes her great frustration. More concerned with getting the animal to obey her commands, will she be able to let go of her demands long enough to establish a bond?Rollan ends up in jail while trying to obtain medicine for another sick orphan. When Essix, the falcon, shows up, he suddenly finds himself of great interest to a variety of people, both good and bad. Suspicious of their motives, Rollan struggles to decide what he should do or if he should get involved at all. In addition, his falcon doesn't seem to be connecting to him at all.A fun series for younger middle grade fantasy readers, Mull has once again crafted a fascinating world based on Earth. A series I can comfortably recommend to both general and reluctant readers."}, {"userName": "Angigames", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27639962-angigames", "userReview": "3 stelle e mezzoCarino, carino, carino!

Basically, the book was about four kids. At the age of eleven, as is customary in this magical world, each partakes of a nectar that determines whether or not the child will summon a spirit animal. The animals become connected to the child, and they can lend them strength when needed. The four main characters summon the Four Fallen, a wolf, falcon, panda, and leopard. These magical beasts have not been seen since the last great battle of the world. They signalThe beginning of a new era of danger. I thought that the differences in each spirit animal help establish a very different POV for each kid. Also, i liked how each main character was from a distinct culture: one a lowly sheepherder, one a ragged, poor orphan, one an insanely rich and prestigious Chinese girl with incredible skilll, and one a wild, brave, African girl. I listened to the audiobook, which was very well done. Overall a good book, look forward to reading the next ones in the series, especially since Shannon Hale and Marie Lu are writing one of the books in the series."}, {"userName": "Adriana", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4645742-adriana", "userReview": "I don't know how this series has bypassed my attention for almost two years. It is one of the greatest portrayals of adventure books I've ever come across. The characters, the plot, the world building were all spectacular. I was drawn in by Nicola Barber's voice and loved every second of my experience. This series is supremely underrated. I know that I've only read the first book, but I truly believe the rest of the books in the Spirit Animals series are going to be amazing. I do worry though because each of the seven books is written by a different author, however I am convinced I will enjoy them all.(Longer review to come)"}, {"userName": "Etienne", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11486904-etienne", "userReview": "Je n'ai vraiment pas accroch\u00e9 \u00e0 ce livre. Puisque chaque tome de la s\u00e9rie est diff\u00e9rent, je donnerai tout de m\u00eame une chance au deuxi\u00e8me tome, mais je ne suis pas tr\u00e8s confiant. Premi\u00e8rement, il y a beaucoup de personnages et chaque personnages ou presque a un animal totem, donc tous les personnages sont \u00abdoubl\u00e9\u00bb d'une certaine fa\u00e7on, cela fait donc beaucoup de noms \u00e0 retenir. De plus, cest personnages et leur totem sont mal d\u00e9finis. Leur personnalit\u00e9 est flou, interchangeable presque et je n'ai pas pu m'attacher \u00e0 eux. Deuxi\u00e8me point, l'intrigue n'est pas mauvaise, mais banale, peu originale et ne se d\u00e9marque malheuresement en rien, comme l'univers en soi d'ailleurs, de la masse. Troisi\u00e8me et dernier point, une \u00e9criture terne, ennuyante m\u00eame, oui c'est du jeunesse donc on diminue un peu les attenbtes et la profondeur \u00e0 ce niveau, mais tout de m\u00eame. J'avoue ne pas comprendre les immenses notes de la s\u00e9rie sur Goodreads, car m\u00eame si ce premier tome n'est pas compl\u00e8tement mauvais, c'est loin d'\u00eatre un incontournable ou un livre que je recommanderais. Il se fait tellement de bonne litt\u00e9rature jeunesse (Harry Potter, Amos D'Aragon, Percy Jackson, The Summoner (Le conjurateur ou L'invocateur en fran\u00e7ais je n'arrive jamais \u00e0 me rappeler...)) qui ont su se d\u00e9marquer et atteindre un autre niveau, que certaines s\u00e9rie n'apportent tout simplement rien de diff\u00e9rent pour vraiment affirmer leur place."}, {"userName": "Nicole (betweenendpages) ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55363652-nicole-betweenendpages", "userReview": "I read this as a request from one of my 6th grade students, and I\u2019m thoroughly impressed!

At the start of the story, however, children start calling The Great Beasts, who are more than just spirit animals. They were the original warriors in a battle that happened long ago to protect the world from evil. It looks as though that dark force is rising up and this group of children have to band together to stop it once again.I was not expecting to like this book as much as it did. I thought it\u2019d be a quick read, a nice palette cleanser before I went off to a more serious/interesting book. I was completely surprised by how much I enjoyed myself. While it was a quick read, Mull expertly set up the fantasy world; it is at once complex and easily understood. The magic system is interesting and I\u2019m looking forward to learning more about it. I love the idea of a coming-of-age ritual that results in having an animal companion that boosts your skills. There is also an organization that takes in people with spirit animals commonly called \u201cThe Green Cloaks,\u201d which supposedly helps to protect the balance of the world.The characters are each so different, and I appreciated that we were able to get each of their perspectives. It was also interesting to have one character be recruited for the \u201cother\u201d side so that we got an inside look of that. Each character is so relatable and awesome; I only was irritated by one character, but I was still interested in her story, so it didn\u2019t take me out of the story too much; I\u2019m excited to see them work together more, so we can see how their strengths interact with each other.What\u2019s interesting about this series is that a different author writes each book, so Maggie Stiefvater wrote the second one. I\u2019m a bit hesitant, because this one was so good, so I wonder how the style will differ, but I\u2019m looking forward to returning to Erdas and reading more about the characters!Also posted on Purple People Readers."}, {"userName": "Erik This Kid Reviews Books", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7532583-erik-this-kid-reviews-books", "userReview": "It was the day that Conor, Abeke, Meilin, and Rollan turned 11. Four kids from lands far apart from each other all turning 11 on the same day. Not really a big deal right? Wrong! When a child turns 11 in the world of Erdas they get a chance to summon a spirit animal. If they are meant to have a spirit animal, it comes out of nowhere and forms a bond with the child forever. The bond gives the child and animal great powers. These four kids summon the great legendary animals that were killed in battle \u2013 Briggan the Wolf, Uraza the Leopard, Jhi the Panda and Essix the Falcon. Together the four children and their Spirit Animals must stop the evil Devourer from destroying Erdas before it is too late!When I first read about this new series by Scholastic I thought, \u201cOkay so they are making another 39 Clues type series\u201d (series of books written by different authors). When I read further I saw it was Brandon Mull (author of the Fablehaven and The Beyonders series) who was writing the first book (that got my interest). Brandon Mull is a great fantasy author. The books of his I\u2019ve read gets me totally involved in the story. The Spirit Animals series is a fantasy series and Mr. Mull\u2019s book in the series was the perfect start. I love his style of adding a bit of humor (like Conor is a sheep-herder and his Spirit Animal is a wolf \u2013 HA!) to a whole lot of action. The world of Erdas is described well and I liked learning about the new characters and their Spirit Animals. Conor was my favorite character in this book. I think fans of The 39 Clues and fantasy books will love Wild Born, Book 1 of Spirit Animals!*NOTE* I got an ARC copy of this book in exchange for an honest review"}, {"userName": "Erika B.

This book reminded me a lot of the Golden Compass series with the kids and the animal connection but Brandon did make it his own. Also I think that elementary aged kids are going to love it! This book is about four kids in the land of Erdas who drink a ceremonial nectar and each find themselves with an ancient spirit animal. There's a wolf, a bird, a panda, and a leopard. They must use these animals to hunt down a talisman and fight a war that is brewing in their land. I was entertained throughout the whole book! There was a battle in the book where it was animals and humans fighting and all I could imagine was Aslan showing up and saving Narnia...then I realized that is not the right story I was currently enjoying! (For Narnia...always!) I also am waiting for my spirit animal to appear! Come on lioness! Apparently if I go to spiritanimals.com I could have a spirit animal and also play a game that goes along with the book! Books are so interactive these days! That'll be way fun for the kiddies!
