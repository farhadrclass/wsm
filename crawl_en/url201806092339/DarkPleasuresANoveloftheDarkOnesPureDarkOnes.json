There's so much going on in this book. In addition to my original review below, I'll add what made me fall in love with Devlin and Grace all over again.#1 He's a charmer with a vulnerable, loving heart. AND he's a god in bed. What else can a girl ask for?I keep trying to find a picture that does Devlin justice, but can't seem to get him right. This one looks too old and doesn't have his eyes. But you get the picture :P#2 Grace is brilliantly funny. Without trying to be. She reminds me of some of my very high IQ engineering friends in college (except they were all male).#3 The HOTT LOVE SCENES!!!! AJ is the queen of the intense love connection :)#4 The truly romantic finale.Grace, honey, you really outdone yourself. Devlin didn't have a chance against all that wooing!#5 The amazing world-building and character evolution that I've come to expect from AJMaking me beg for more!!!Below my original review.I always love everything Ms. James writes. The Pure Dark series just keeps getting better and better!I love that we meet Sophia again in the prologue and epilogue. I've been missing her from Book 1, Pure Healing. We get doses of Innana and Gabriel from Book 2, a mysterious person from Book 3, the Creature and Ere (who I have my suspicions about),members of the Chosen and Queen Jade, and Tal and Mama-Bear. I love it! Aaaannndd, we get to meet a new recruit, who's pretty badass.I really bonded with Grace, but I still want to steal Devlin for my own forever mate. He's just so perfect! Sort of the good rake from regency romances that I also like to read, except he's never really been a rake, even though all his comrades think he is one.And the cliff hanger at the end! I know I won't be sleeping tonight again until I finish Book 5!"}, {"userName": "Princess under cover", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9604542-princess-under-cover", "userReview": "[Why does the mysterious E.

I enjoy the world that she tends to bring to life with her written word. This was no different, The second book may have been my favorite one in the series thus far, but I am not bored reading anything she writes. I find it fulfilling and of course, I do very much love my happy endings. I know in the end she is working on a big series climax and I can not wait to see what that is. Great Job Aja I am looking forward to seeing what you come up with next."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44244213-laura", "userReview": "Wow another fab 5 star read... I loved Grace she was so robotic and funny, she has no shame whatsoever its great!!! Aja is a Genius Character creator i don't think i have ever read a series with so much diversity, and each of her characters rule the book and mold the story its amazing!!!! Grace was extremely cleverly written, right down to the psychological aspects it was flawless.She is definitely Vulcan or Borg lol!In this spectacular addition we get to delve deeper into Devlin.... As he meets and falls for Grace a girl who suffers something akin to Asperger and has trouble calculating emotions, all while trying to unravel the mystery that is Medusa and the threat she is posing.Alot of great reveals left me like.....Im hoping to learn a little more about Grace in future books... why so much hidden information on her and why were her parents killed???But another fab read!"}, {"userName": "The Drowsy Bookworm", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39479333-the-drowsy-bookworm", "userReview": "I was kindly given an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review!Dark Pleasures tells Devlin Sinclair\u2019s story. Devlin is the sexy, somewhat smart-alecky Dark One we\u2019ve gotten glimpses of in the past 2 books. Half the fun of the Pure/Dark Ones series is that (unless you ruin it by reading the blurb) you don\u2019t know whose story is going to be coming up next. The other half of the fun is reading the books, which continue to pique my interest and keep me ravenous for more information.The female star of this book is Grace Darling, who\u2019s an unlikely heroine as someone with a diagnosis on the autism spectrum. She lives alone and abides by a strict schedule, with only her aunt to check in on her. She likes it that way, too, until she meets Devlin. Grace\u2019s interaction with Devlin confuses her, because emotions aren\u2019t second nature to Grace. She\u2019s a hacker, and her mind works in scientific and mathematical ways. I won\u2019t ruin it here but the way that Grace and Devlin first begin their \u201crelationship\u201d is hilarious. If only it could be so cut and dry for all of us as it is for Grace!The story differs here from previous books because Ms. Aja James usually makes us wait for the male/female main characters to end up in bed together \u2013 this book starts out with a bang (badum-dum!) but that\u2019s certainly not the end of it. And in addition to Grace & Devlin\u2019s storyline we get a peek at some of our other favorite characters. In true Aja fashion we only get to see a little of this here, and little of that there-just enough to whet our appetite for more. It\u2019s hard to say too much without giving spoilers, but know that some of your favorite side characters from recent books pop up just enough to drop a few more revelations. You think you have some things figured out but then a two minute conversation between certain characters can turn that completely upside down! This has to truly be one of the most well thought-out and planned series as I\u2019m just amazed how everything ties in together, even things that previously seemed disconnected or standalone. And the characters that Aja James creates are either loveable or you love-to-hate-them, there\u2019s not too much in between. As usual, the ending leaves me only wanting more!!"}, {"userName": "Pamela", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6701070-pamela", "userReview": "Review posted soon."}, {"userName": "SarahSmith", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1466270-sarahsmith", "userReview": "I received an ARC from the author!This series just keeps getting better and better. I love Devlin and Grace as a couple, but to be honest I was a bit more obsessed with Grace than Devlin. I loved that she was a genius/socially inept a la Sherlock (BBC), and that the author didn't stick to gender norms in that regard. And I especially loved that she knew what she wanted sexually and wasn't afraid to go for it! I was also super excited to see more of Sophia and I can't wait to read her novella. I definitely can't wait for the next in the series either!"}, {"userName": "Mamacita wants a Bedtime Story", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36046785-mamacita-wants-a-bedtime-story", "userReview": "4.5 \"I'm Not Normal\" StarsSo ya'll know I love this series. Like Love, Love! Like I'm obsessed with this series...The characters are well written, the story is extremely thought thru & fleshed out, & the plot flows well from book to book. Ya'll, I cannot brag on this author enough.I really liked the Hero Devlin. I loved his back story. I understood him & felt his vulnerability. The side stories were a treat. There was a couple of of Twist that were a nice treat. Lots & lots of Great For Me... My ONLY issue was I didn't feel connected to the Heroine. She has Autism Spectrum Disorder. I can emphasize with her, but I have a hard time connecting to her. I did feel her struggle with her disorder & how it impacted not only her but everyone around her. Where as she didn't \"feel emotions\" or or connected to people I have the opposite problem. I feel TOO MUCH & connect deeply to people. But that is TOTALLY MY ISSUE. Grace was still a great character & I feel like the author did her justice regarding her disorder.I really liked how these characters balanced each other very well. Each was what the other needed. She needed to feel & he needed to be felt. That was beautiful! The ending for them was perfect!I graciously received an ARC of this book for free from Author in exchange for an honest review.

But at the same time, there's even more made. This series just keeps getting better and drawing me into it's characters and storylines more and more.

Loved the introduction by Sophia , the Pure Ones Queen , full of detail & few smiles . This book brings starts to weave all the characters we've met in previous books into one large, amazing story . We have a romance , we have a breaking of ties but not sure what that breaking means yet & we have true love rejected & looks like its going to end in tragedy , reading between the lines im guessing theres a huge misundertsanding somewhere . This book has so many small stories running through the whole that you daren't put it down & the need to know keeps you turning pages even when you should be sleeping , really can't wait for book five ."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/79870038-carol", "userReview": "Devlin Sinclair who is known as the Dark Ones Hunter. His job is to hack into Zenn and therefore track down Medusa who\u2019s been trying to destroy the Pure/Dark Ones. Although his hacking skills are among the best, it\u2019s still not enough, he\u2019s going to need help from Grace Darling who\u2019s not only the very best hacker but she also apparently working for Zenn the enemy. Chatting online and gaining her trust while pretending to be someone else, Devlin meets Grace for a blind date. Devlin sits down and turns on his charm but Grace just stares at him and says nothing. Unbeknownst to him before the date she\u2019s already checked out everything about the man he\u2019s pretending to be. Grace hacked into a satellite and knows he should be bald and very plain, not a gorgeous blonde hunk that looks and smells wonderful and sounds even better! Grace tells him she\u2019s going home and heads out. Devlin\u2019s not used to this reaction from any woman and try\u2019s to change her mind as he sees her home, not knowing she already decided to have him for a two week sex toy! This is a steaming sexy hot explosive story about two very different people who find in each other what they are both missing. I think anyone would absolutely love this book! Aja James Pure/ Dark Ones world that she\u2019s created in this series is amazing and such fun to read! I can hardly wait to find out what\u2019s coming next with all the characters like Tal, and Moma Bear, Sophie, the creature, oh and Ramses the new one Max just recruited!

The author continues come up with unique and intricate plots to keep each book in the series different and captivating, yet has a continuous story that links them all together. As expected there were some serious twists hidden in this one and also some nice revelations that the readers deserved! But there are still a lot of big ones we have yet to discover, so I can only imagine what the author will come up with next! The plot is very well developed and has the perfect pace to it. There is always a lot happening, making this a very difficult book to put down, but I expect no less at this point from this series. As usual there are quite a few hot steamy scenes in this one as well.I find it interesting that in this one again, the author picked a character that is not usually chosen as a main character in a paranormal book. In her last one it was basically a genius level female scientist, which is rather rare in a paranormal book, but in this one she took it a step further and picked an autistic female lead, along the lines of Asperger's I would say. I found that very interesting and refreshing and somehow the author made it work. You can't help but adore Grace and her transformation that you see her going through in this book. Yes I know in real life that would never happen that quickly but it was still very interesting to read.And oh Devlin, that poor man. You can't help but feel for him when you find out about his past and then you just know he had no chance against Grace. She was an all consuming avalanche and that was pretty much it! Those two together are just too much and again the author found a way to make them work.I admit, I may be biased but I love this series. The steamy scenes sometimes can be maybe a bit much, but that is part of what this series is based on. The author spends a lot of time on character development and focuses each book on a specific pair usually but also provides more insight on some other characters you have already met or will meet in the near future! Her action parts pack a punch and her plots are very well developed. In my eyes that is great. She brings a new twist to your usual vampire story by introducing Dark Ones vs Pure Ones and your standard Vampire. So any author that can bring a new twist to your vampire story to me already is way ahead of the game, and no she did not make them sparkle!"}, {"userName": "Kel (Faerie-bookworm)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4319101-kel-faerie-bookworm", "userReview": "Title: Dark PleasuresAuthor:  Aja JamesGenre:  Adult, Paranormal, RomanceFormat:  Ebook - ARCPages:  Rating:  5Heat:  5Thoughts: I swear the stories keep getting better and better in this series!
