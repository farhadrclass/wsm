It\u2019s pictures I do \u2013 did. I\u2019m a painter. Was.\u201d\u201cOh. I thought it was stories.\u201d\u201cWell, it isn\u2019t. Wasn\u2019t.\u201dOr is it\u2026 was it?The triviality of this short exchange between Oliver Orme and his older, gawky sister Olivia is far from inconsequential. And so it is the coincidence of names, the recurrence of vowels and the androgyny of its owners. Words and proper names are the true protagonists in this story because they engender the distorted echoes in the deceptive yet magnetic ebb and flow from self-obsessed delusion to lucid awareness, of the reverberating confession of a deeply anguished man, an artist of great talent, a snake charmer with many masks, confronting a midlife crisis.But who is the real Oliver? Can we trust his version of the story?An artist who falls in love with a woman whose body resembles a cello. And so he steals her to use her as his muse.Now, abandoned and rejected, Oliver has stopped painting. He might not be a painter, but he will always be a thief. He doesn\u2019t steal for money, but for the almost erotic pleasure of snatching objects cherished by others, for the rush of adrenaline of pilfering irresistible possessions, such as Polly, the wife of his best friend Marcus, and get away with it, uncaught.But, on this occasion, before this reckless theft is brought to light only to unchain irreparable consequences for Marcus, Polly, Oliver and his wife Gloria, the shamefaced painter will seek the safe haven of his childhood home at the top of the hill to face his own demons. Following the archetypical Banville-style; an absolutely delectable choice of words, a thoroughly studied pattern of symbolic motives that unfold in flawless poetic prose; the reader gets immersed, unbeknown to him, in the maelstrom of an inner monologue by, not only an unreliable, but often despicable narrator. But beware of this modern Caliban! A hazy spectre with a body and without a conscience enslaved by his own talent shows only a partial picture of the truth. And yet, does truth exist in absolute terms? In Oliver\u2019s irreverently honest and self-deprecating admission of his foibles and mistakes, he ends up earning the respect of the reader because he is as repentant as incapable of making amends to those he has failed on repeated occasions. He tells his truth, which is as valid as any other. And isn\u2019t that the greatest lesson for us, fallible human beings? That of recognizing a bit of ourselves in this murky portrait of a clueless man who has lost his way in the maze of life?Tiepolo. Manet. Picasso. Matisse. Bonnard. Botticelli. Daumier. Courbet. Poussin. Olier Otway Orme. O O O. An absurdity? Or a mirror image of another artist-thief? For, isn\u2019t painting, like stealing, a fruitless effort to utterly possess?And isn\u2019t the creative output of these painters a representation of their particular understanding of the world, of their inimitable truths? The gist of Banville\u2019s works remains in the elliptical curves of his artistic talent, in the vast palette of his words, which will infuse color, with its unavoidable malignant shine, into the broken shadows in the corners of any heart who throbs ardently for the visual texture of a virtuoso at work, displaying his talent and unmasking himself and the spectator with one and only voice; that of a man who accepts his weaknesses and bears them with dignity.\u201cThings as they areAre changed upon the blue guitar.\u201d Wallace Stevens."}, {"userName": "Kalliope", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3593962-kalliope", "userReview": "[(the life of Copernicus inDoctor Copernicus, or the story of Paul de Man in Shroud) (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Algernon", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4728718-algernon", "userReview": "Call me Autolycus. Well, no, don't. Although I am, like that unfunny clown, a picker-up of unconsidered trifles. Which is a fancy way of saying I steal things. As opening lines go, this one is quite promising with its multitude of possible interpretations and even with the playful plagiarism (thievery) of the better known Herman Melville opening gambit. All artists 'borrow', don't they? Few though admit it so blandly as Oliver Ottway Orme, the self-styled Autolycus of the opening monologue. I'm guessing he's making a play for the reader's sympathy by coming clear right from the start with the fact that he is both a scoundrel and an artist, presumably living in a higher sphere where ethical and social scruples don't apply. Note 1: according to wikipedia: \" Autolycus obtained most of the same skills that his supposed father Hermes possesses, such as the art of theft, trickery, and skill with the lyre and gracious song. It was said that he \"loved to make white of black, and black of white, from a hornless animal to a horned one, or from horned one to a hornless\". He was given the gift that his thievery could not be caught by anyone. Note 2 : later in the novel Autolycus morphs into the Minotaur, a horned monster hiding in darkness, lost in a labyrinth of his own design, refusing even Ariadne's (Polly?) offer of a way out. Banville does this allegory stuff so subtly that I believe there are at least twice as many classical and modern allegories that I missed and will only be revealed by an annotated edition and by a couple of re-reads. Just as art uses up its materials by absorbing them wholly into the work, as Collingwood avers - a painting consumes the paint and canvas, while a table is forever its wood - so too the act, the art of stealing transmutes the object stolen. In time, most possessions lose their patina, become dulled and anonymous; stolen, they spring back to life, take on the sheen of uniqueness again. In this way, is not the thief doing a favour to things by dint of renewing them? Does he not enhance the world by buffing up its tarnished silver? Orme argues that, by stealing trifles, ideas and women's hearts, he tranforms them into art, gives them meaning and beauty. That's a self-serving argument that I have heard before, and the aliteration in the name of the main character makes it easier to trace the original owner : Humbert Humbert, the dirty rotten scoundrel that people love to hate. Many reviewers have in fact pointed out the similarities in style and content between Banville and Nabokov. The plot, such as it is in this meandering novel that is more concerned with a meditation on art and mortality, is driven by the interactions between two middle-aged couples. Oliver Orme and his wife Gloria are trying to cope with the loss of a young daughter while Marcus Pettit and his wife Polly are living a conventional, bourgeois existence in the small coastal town where Orme was born. One man is a painter (Orme), the other a craftsman repairing old watches (Marcus). Both women seem to be the housewife type, unemployed. It's not much of a spoiler to tell you that the existential crisis is triggered by an affair Oliver has with the younger Polly, since it is mentioned in the opening pages.  Particularly unsettling was the look in her eyes, a mixture of fear and doubt and defiance, and utter, utter helplessness. Whyever did she let me wheedle my way into her heart? When the betrayal is revealed, Oliver does the unchivalrous gesture and runs away, goes into hiding in his parents house. The rest of the novel is a long, non-linear and painful journey / intimate journal both into Orme's past and into the present turmoil, seen through the eyes of the man who both wants to swallow the world and to avoid the pain of emotional involvement. Let me state it clearly. My aim in the art of thieving, as it was in the art of painting, is the absorbtion of world into self. The pilfered object becomes not only mine, it becomes me, and thereby takes on new life, the life that I give it. Too grand, you say, too highfalutin? Scoff all you like, I don't care: I know what I know. Did I tell you that Orme is having a mid-life crisis? He may know the theory of art backwards, but when it comes to put it in practice he's stumped, he's lost his mojo, he hasn't put brush to canvas in years. His intimate journal is thus not so much a way to justify his 'stealing' but a lifetime quest to pin down the ineffable that transmutes the profane into the sacred. I know I'm using a lot of big words here, but that's what reading Banville does to you (same as Nabokov did a couple of years back). I was looking back through my bookmarks, and it took me hours to thin them down because I always ended up captivated by the flow of ideas and by the elegance of the presentation, re-reading favorite passages and being loath to trim down the lenghtier ones. Many times I noticed how Banville digs deep into his thesaurus for the most unsual words to add colour to his phrasing: It's true, clandestine love is always spoken of in terms of stealing. Now, asportation, say, or even caption, in its rarest usage - yes, I have been rifling the dictionary again - is a term I might accept, but stealing I think too stark a word. A painter, a writer, a musician, any artist worth his/her salt would know about these tricks of the trade, about how to grab the public's attention and turn their expectations on their head. Words, colours, sounds (smells are often used by Banville to create mood) - Orme is linking them all to a titanic struggle (at least in his own eyes) for meaning, a struggle in which he plays the role of the soldier defeated in battle, retired back to his ivory tower, licking his wounds and complaining about the unfair odds. Everybody thinks it must be easy to be a painter, if you have some skill and master a few basic rules and aren't colour-blind. And it's true the technical side of it isn't so difficult, a matter of practice, hardly more than a knack, really. Technique can be acquired, technique you can learn, with time and effort, but what about the rest of it, the bit that really counts, where does that come from? Borne down from the empyrean by plump putty and scattered upon the favoured few like Danaean gold? I hardly think so. Empathy, insight, talent - whatever it is that separates artists from the common people - Oliver Orme has misplaced it, and his attempts to rekindle the flame by stealing trinkets or by falling in love with another man's wife only serve to underline his impotence, his silence, his distance from the Truth. I was striving to take the world into myself and make it over, to make something new of it, something vivid and vital, and essence be hanged. A boa constrictor, that was me, a huge, wide-open mouth slowly, slowly swallowing, trying to swallow, gagging on enormity. Painting, like stealing, was an endless effort at possession, and endlessly I failed. Stealing other people's goods, daubing scenes, loving Polly: all the one, in the end. The sense of futility is reiterated on every other page, like the refrain of a popular tune that you cannot help humming for days, driving you crazy in the end. My early sympathy for Orme turned into revulsion over his self-pity and his almost catatonic response to the presence of other people in his life. His self-absorbtion is as monumental as his ambitions, and the fact that he acknowledges his selfishness is not enough for redemption in my eyes. I found it very hard to reconcile the beautiful, elegant arguments about the nature of art with Orme's unsavoury actions, sending me again back to Nabokov and the probably deliberate provocative nature of the story. Strange to have the eye and the urge to paint and not be able to do it. I stand stooped before the world like an agued old man in impotent contemplation of a naked and shamelessly willing girl. Rue and Rheum, that's my lot, poor pained painster that I am.  (probably another 'borrowing' here, the rust without the stardust of Humbert Humbert) You see my predicament? I state it again, simply: the world without, the world within, and betwixt them the unbridgeable, the unleapable, chasm. And so I gave up. The great sin I am guilty of, the greatest, is despair. also, I could say that one day I woke up and the world was lost to me, but how would that sound? Anyway, hadn't I always painted not the world itself but the world as my mind rendered it? >><<>><<>><<>><<The million dollar question in Orme's case is: why waste my time reading the manic depressive confessions of a selfish brute, of a thief and a liar who wallows in self-pity and refuses to give life another chance? I would answer with another question: is Orme really a poseur, a 'phony' as Truman Capote called them, or is he a candid image of a passionate artist tormented by doubt. Being in my fifties and with little to show for it either financially or emotionally, I could decidely find things to relate to in Orme's dilemma: The truth is, I think, I never started to live in the first place. Always I was about to begin. As a child I said that when I grew up, that would be life. Next it was the death of my parents I secretly looked forward to, thinking it must be the birth of me, a delivery into my true state of selfhood. After that it was love, love would surely do the trick, when a woman, any woman, would come along and make a man of me. Or success, riches, bags of banknotes, the world' acclaim, all these would be ways of living, of being vividly alive, at last. And so I waited, year on year, stage after stage, for the great drama to commence. Then the day came when I knew the day wouldn't come, and I gave up waiting. also, I'm tired of the past, of the wish to be there and not here. When I was there I writhed fretfully enough in my fetters. I'm pushing fifty and feel a hundred, big with years. What exactly is it out there in the modern world to make us happy and optimistic? Aren't the comedians and the happy-go-lucky the true phonies who close their eyes and their minds to the loneliness and despair of existence, pretending to believe in a benevolent deity or in another chance at doing it right in an imaginary paradise? Remove the thin coat of bright paint and you find an underlaying layer of a deep blue, almost black despair. Orme tells us about his last project, the canvas that he could never finish when the incredibly vivid colours of sunny Provence clashed with his morbid northern hopelessness: But take that last thing I was working on, the unfinished piece that finished me for good: look at the blimp-coloured guitar and the table with the checked cloth that it rests on; look at the louvred window opening onto the terrace and the flat blue beyond; look at that gay sailboat. This was not the world I knew; these were not my true subject. Finally, we understand the title of the novel and the epigraph Banville borrowed from the Walace Stevens poem about art:  \"Things as they areAre changed upon the blue guitar\"  Orme sees the world through the blue coloured glass of his depression. I might despise him for giving up, but I cannot deny the strength or the honesty of his feelings. My verdict in his case would be not a phony, just a lost soul. The house around me hums faintly, so that I seem to be inside a large machine, a generator, say, on stand-by, or the engine of a steam train shunted into into a siding for the night and still trembling with memories of the day's fire and speed and noise. I will stop at a landing window and press my forehead to the glass and look out over the sleeping town and think what a Byronic figure I must cut, perched up here, solitary and tragic-seeming, no more to go a-roving. This is the way it is with me, always looking in or looking out, a chilly pane of glass between me and a remote and longed-for world. >><<>><<>>><<>><<The other argument for giving the novel full marks and adding it to my favorites is the way Banville goes from intellectual challenges / existential arguments to surprising lines of poetry, scattered like gemstones in the middle of a bland page ( ... so there is stardust in the world, after all!) . My remaining quotes will hopefully offer a glimpse of his masterful touch. Pain, the painster's pain, plunges its blade into my barren heart. - - - -  What I saw, with jarring clarity, was that there was no such thing as woman. Woman, I realized, is a thing of legend, a phantasm who flies through the world, settling here and there on this and that unsuspecting mortal female, whom she turns, briefly but momentously, into an object of yearning, veneration and terror. - - - -  They leave so little trace, our lost ones; a sigh on the wind and they're gone.  - - - -  It strikes me that what I have always done was to let my eye play over the world like weather, thinking I was making it mine, more, making it me, while in truth I had no more effect than sunlight or rain, the shadow of a cloud. Love, too, of course, working to transform, transfigure, the flesh made form. All in vain. The world, the women, are what they always were and will be, despite my most insistent efforts. - - - -  The tension of things: that was always the most difficult quality to catch, in whatever medium I employed. Everything is braced against the pull of the world, straining to rise but grounded to the earth. A violin is always lighter than it looks, strung so tensely on its strings, and when you pick it up you feel it wanting to rise out of your hand. [...] Did I ever achieve anything of that litheness, that air-aspiring buoyancy? No, I think. My things were always gravid, weighed down with the too-much that I expected of them. - - - -  Do birds sing at this late time of year? Maybe their kind also has its bards, its rhapsodes, its solitary poets of desolation and lament, who know no seasons. The day wanes, the night comes on, soon I'll have to light my lamp. For now, though, I am content to sit here in the October gloaming, brooding on my loves, my losses, my paltry sins. What's to become of me, of my dry, my dessicated, heart?Why do I ask, you ask? Don't you understand yet, even yet, that I don't understand anything? See how I grope my way along, like a blind man in a house where all the lights are blazing.The day wanes."}, {"userName": "Phrynne", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne", "userReview": "My first by this author and I will be looking out for more especially as many of the reviews tell me this is not his best book!

I doubt that I will ever use asportation or haruspicate in conversation or in print but I am very glad that John Banville did. And it was not just his knowledge of vocabulary. He also has a gift for putting the words together to make magical phrases.I guess this is not the kind of book you necessarily read for its story but The Blue Guitar does have a tale to tell. The narrator is not the nicest of men, nor is he totally reliable in his recall but a story does emerge and I was pulled in by it.Really it is a short book, but dense and it needs to be read slowly to appreciate the way it is written as well as what it is about.

L\u2019ultima parte riprende le fila e l\u2019ho trovata decisamente ben riuscita.Forse quello che \u00e8 riuscito a tenermi attaccata alle pagine anche nei momenti di disorientamento \u00e8 stata la scrittura, mentre leggevo mi balzavano continuamente davanti agli occhi colori e scene vivide, un\u2019atmosfera cupa eppure mobile, viva: sar\u00e0 stato per effetto dell\u2019onnipresente pioggia, in tutte le sue varianti, del vento con i suoi sibili e scricchiolii, dei sempre cangianti colori del cielo\u2026 sembrava quasi dipingesse sotto i miei occhi quel che aveva da dire.O forse quel che mi ha irretita \u00e8 stato questo personaggio equivoco che si racconta con onest\u00e0, una certa dose di ironia, e una grande introspezione - e sottigliezza - psicologica. In generale, devo dire, mi piacciono i personaggi negativi. Trovo in loro amplificati anche i miei difetti, ed \u00e8 un modo per rifletterci con un distacco che nei miei confronti non riesco ad avere. O forse invece \u00e8 solo una scusa per potermi compiacere dei miei difetti, pu\u00f2 essere.Qui, in particolare, abbiamo un rappresentante della mia tipologia preferita di personaggi negativi: un ladro, un bugiardo, un fedifrago, ma essenzialmente un perdente.

Banville shows a painterly eye for detail, he is an expert at capturing moods and emotions, and there is plenty of dry humour.

C'\u00e8 un pittore in crisi d'identit\u00e0 e di ispirazione, si chiama Oliver Otway Orme, \u00e8 sulla soglia dei cinquant'anni ed \u00e8 sposato con Gloria, pi\u00f9 giovane di lui di vent'anni. \"Non avrei mai dovuto sposare una donna pi\u00f9 giovane. Quella sua vivacit\u00e0 sbrigativa alla mia et\u00e0 non \u00e8 pi\u00f9 sopportabile\". Il suo amico orologiaio ha una moglie, Polly, anch'essa pi\u00f9 giovane di Oliver. Saranno amanti per nove mesi, dopodich\u00e9 Oliver scappa nella sua casa natale da solo a rimuginare sulla sua vita. Sembra stare via un secolo ma in effetti sta via per una settimana prima che riescano a stanarlo. \"Non si \u00e8 mai troppo vecchi per sentirsi rimproverati come dei bambini\". La chitarra blu \u00e8 la sua vita, suppongo, mentre la sta vedendo e rivedendo. Ed \u00e8 anche un quadro, in cui raffigura una chitarra blu che assomiglia a un dirigibile. Quadro che lascer\u00e0 incompiuto. Ma poi accadono molte altre cose, soprattutto che Oliver \u00e8 un personaggio comico, un osservatore strampalato del mondo, ruba piccoli oggetti senza nessun tornaconto personale, allo stesso modo sembra fare con le persone, un irresponsabile che come ama dire sua moglie, parlare con lui \u00e8 come parlare col cuscino. Un libro bellissimo. Mi ha sbalordito la capacit\u00e0 di descrizione di Banville; un autentico pittore della parola. Tra i suoi libri avevo letto Il mare (2005), il suo pi\u00f9 noto e premiato, ma in questo romanzo riesce ad avere una particolare, ispirata, comicit\u00e0 che era pressoch\u00e9 assente in quello. Ho preferito di gran lunga La chitarra blu che mi riconcilia con Banville, mi fa apprezzare finalmente il suo calor freddo. Ho annotato alcune frasi illuminanti, eccole: Una coppia sposata non sembra mai cos\u00ec sposata come quando la guardi dal sedile posteriore di un'automobile mentre parla sottovoce dai sedili davanti. Nessun silenzio \u00e8 come il silenzio che accompagna il ladro. Ma il punto \u00e8 questo. Era precisamente per le sue imperfezioni che l'amavo. E l'ho amata, sinceramente. Vale a dire, sinceramente, l'ho amata, non che l'ho amata sinceramente. Com'\u00e8 infida la lingua, pi\u00f9 sfuggente persino della pittura. Polly ha le gambe piuttosto corte e polpacci che una persona meno bendisposta di me potrebbe definire grassi. Ci sono anche le sue mani grassocce e le dita tozze e quel lieve tremolio gelatinoso nella carne pallida sul lato inferiore delle braccia. Ma queste erano, insisto, proprio le cose che amavo in lei, esattamente come il suo fondoschiena formoso e i suoi seni amabilmente penduli, la sua voce dolce e i suoi occhi grigi luccicanti, i suoi piccoli piedi delicati da geisha. Resto immancabilmente sbalordito dalle cose che accadono in me senza che io lo sappia. Non \u00e8 straordinario come anche le situazioni pi\u00f9 sconcertanti in un minuto o due si assestino in un'ordinaria normalit\u00e0?Ci aspettano sempre nuovi modi di soffrire.Che tempo meraviglioso abbiamo avuto per il funerale, s\u00ec, una giornata assolutamente magnifica. \u00c8 fine novembre ed \u00e8 tornato l'autunno, le giornate sono tutte spalmate di luce densa e brillante come confettura d'albicocca, fragranze inebrianti di fumo e intensa decomposizione pervadono l'aria e tutto \u00e8 fulvo o risplendente d'azzurro. Nella notte la temperatura scende in picchiata e al mattino le rose, che ancora fioriscono, sono merlettate di brina; poi arriva il sole e chinano la testa piangendo per un'ora."}, {"userName": "Jo\u00e3o Carlos", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17544299-jo-o-carlos", "userReview": "4 Estrelas Azuis+1 Estrela Mr. John BanvilleJohn Banville - 86\u00ba Feira do Livro - Lisboa - Portugal (2016-05-28)Oliver Otway Orme, o narrador de \u201dA Guitarra Azul\u201d, o d\u00e9cimo sexto romance do escritor irland\u00eas John Banville (n. 1945), \u00e9 um Aut\u00f3lico - \u201d\u00c9 o meu segredo vergonhoso, um dos meus segredos vergonhosos, do qual, todavia, n\u00e3o me envergonho tanto como devia.

But never as much as on this occasion. I felt totally self-conscious because I don\u2019t have the skills to write a review that is worthy of such a tremendous novel. So bear with me as I stagger through writing this review.This was my first John Banville novel. To be honest, I hadn\u2019t heard of him, but when I saw that he\u2019s a Man Booker Prize winner, the literary snob in me I decided that I should request it on NetGalley.I\u2019ve read some great books in my life, but I can\u2019t remember the last time I was awed by somebody\u2019s writing to this extent. My poor brain was exploding with enchantment, incredulity, and admiration. It starts like this:\u201cCall me Autolycus. Well, no, don\u2019t. Although I am, like that unfunny clown, a picker-up of unconsidered trifles. Which is a fancy way of saying I steal things.\u201dThe Blue Guitar is about Oliver Orme. He\u2019s a famous painter, who can\u2019t paint anymore, and who likes to steal little things of no use, just for the thrill of it. He\u2019s pushing fifty and is having some sort of delayed mid-life crisis.\u201cChildhood is supposed to be a radiant springtime but mine seems to have been always autumn, the gales seething in the big beeches behind this old gate-lodge, as they\u2019re doing right now, and the rooks above them wheeling haphazard, like scraps of char from a bonfire, and a custard-coloured gleam having its last go low down in the western sky\u201d.This is a character driven novel. It\u2019s Oliver\u2019s musings throughout the entire novel. He\u2019s not a particularly charming character, something that he\u2019s well aware of and admits to it with an uncanny honesty. He\u2019s simple, yet complex. He\u2019s a famous artist who can\u2019t create art anymore. He\u2019s not unhappy but not particularly happy either. He just is. Many times you feel like yelling \u201cget over yourself\u201d! He knows it, too. Banville has created a complex, three-dimensional character. Oliver is as real as they come. Through him Banville is asking what\u2019s real. Who are we? What is our \u201ctrue self\u201d? Is there such a thing as a \u201ctrue self\u201d? Oh, there are so many things to contemplate and think about, it can get a bit exhausting. But don\u2019t let my statement detract you from reading it. Because, while it\u2019s not a fluffy, feel-good novel, it\u2019s filled with humour - smart, sarcastic humour. Banville\u2019s way with words is astounding. I\u2019ve never had to look up so many words as I had to do while reading The Blue Guitar. Don\u2019t get dispirited by this, because you don\u2019t really have to, you\u2019ll understand the gist of it all, but why wouldn\u2019t you? When was the last time you had the opportunity to learn a new word? I personally was mesmerised. And awed. And gobsmacked. And many other things I don\u2019t have the vocabulary to express, at least not eloquently enough. In this world where the \u201clowest common denominator\u201d is the status-quo, I feel grateful and lucky to have come across an author who raises the bar, without being cumbersome or arrogant.Many novels these days include books and music references. The Blue Guitar brings up art, mainly painting references. That was another aspect I truly enjoyed about this novel. Oliver\u2019s irreverence and self-effacing ramblings made me smile on many occasions. For instance, here\u2019s how he describes himself:\u201cThe fact is, whenever I made an overture to a woman, which I seldom did, even in my young days, I never really expected it to be entertained, or even noticed, despite certain instances of success, which I tended to regards as flukes, the result of misunderstanding, or dimness on the part of the woman and simple good fortune on mine. I\u2019m not an immediately alluring specimen, having been, for a start, the runt of the litter. I\u2019m short and stout, or better go the whole hog and say fat, with a big head and tiny feet. My hair is of a shade somewhere between wet rust and badly tarnished brass, and in damp weather, or when I\u2019m by the seaside, clenches itself into curls that are as tight and dense as cauliflower florets and stubbornly resistant to fiercest combings. My skin \u2013 oh, my skin! \u2013 is a flaccid, moist, off-white integument, so that I look as if I had been blanched in the dark for a long time. Of my freckles I shall not speak.\u201dJohn Banville is a wordsmith. Every phrase is painstakingly crafted, as if it were precious glass that he\u2019s carefully blown into art objects, but his are beautifully constructed phrases. His writing has a certain musicality, a cadence that\u2019s quite unique. And he never ceases to surprise, amaze and delight. This is definitely a novel that\u2019s going on my Favourites shelf. I can\u2019t rave enough about it. While it\u2019s not for everyone, if you love good literature, then I wholeheartedly recommend this splendid novel.I\u2019ve received this novel via NetGalley in exchange of an honest review.

An unreliable narrator whose ramblings really don\u2019t amount to very much in the end. In fact the whole book doesn\u2019t amount to very much, in my opinion. Read it all before. An exploration of love, marriage, fatherhood (a tiny bit of compassion for him crept in when he talked about his daughter, but further inward-looking musings soon put paid to that) friendship, and of course, art.

Sulle prime a dir il vero mi era parso di trovare qualche scaglia di luce nabokoviana nelle contorsioni narrative, nella vena memorialistica e nei disgusti capricciosi del pittore celebre ma in crisi che si racconta in prima persona in queste pagine, ma presto quest\u2019impressione positiva ha iniziato a illanguidire per ceder luogo a un sentore di monotonia e insoddisfazione che il preziosismo stilistico, lungi dal mitigare, accresce e mette in evidenza. Il problema \u00e8 che se in un romanzo il protagonista racconta di s\u00e9 in prima persona, magari anche ricorrendo a qualche utilizzo, sia pur moderato, di stream of consciousness, \u00e8 necessario che il personaggio sia o positivo o ad ogni modo simpatico, oppure, se \u00e8 negativo e odioso e tale, insomma, da rendere ardua, se non impossibile dall\u2019inizio, un\u2019identificazione di qualche sorta col lettore, perlomeno grande nella sua negativit\u00e0, e dunque perlomeno interessante. Al contrario, l\u2019Oliver di Banville \u00e8 una carognetta da mezza tacca, un ometto querulo, saccente, logorroico (ciarla senza sosta di stupidaggini per quasi quattrocento pagine), alquanto paranoico, incapace di vedere il buono e il bello negli altri, provvisto d\u2019una stima di s\u00e9 francamente soverchia, privo di qualsiasi empatia, tatto e garbo nell\u2019agire e nel sentire. Uno schifo di uomo, insomma, che forse potrebbe serbare ancora qualche attrattiva letteraria se fosse, che so?, un dittatore, un generale, un cardinale, un onorevole, uno che fra tali miserie di natura e carattere calcasse la scena del mondo da protagonista di grossi eventi; almeno il conseguente risvolto di Denuncia Sociale o d\u2019Impegno Morale aiuterebbe un po\u2019, avventizio ma provvido eupeptico, colagogo e carminativo, a digerire l\u2019uggia. Certo, in casi consimili quando si assiste a una pellicola ci si consola lodando, faute de mieux, la fotografia.

We steal or borrow freely an image, an idea to create our own. Then someone steals from us. What happens when the main character, an artist in John Banville's The Blue Guitar is actually a thief?From young, Oliver Orme stole things. It was an almost perverse, erotic act that thrilled young Oliver. He kept doing this even as he established an art career. But the greatest act of theft, would be to steal another man's woman in the form of adultery (Oliver is married as well). This is a good premise for a book. But what happens when the story seduces me to keep reading about something as distasteful as adultery? Even when I was disgusted by Olly Orme's treatment of his women, I wanted to know why? Or why was Polly cheating on her husband? And what about Orme's wife Gloria? Or the mysterious German prince? Perhaps Banville is robbing me? What? My values? Social norms? Time? But this is oh so good. I cannot stop reading.I have read several books by Banville and just before I read this book, someone commented that Banville is such a great writer that most of his books are almost the same tale rehashed into a new form. I thought about this a lot as I read this book. Often his main male characters are weak, self deprecating men, who have issues with women, parents, children and getting through life. But take a look at the mirror, and maybe one sees a little of all of us (maybe mor male then female as his females are much better than the sad males) trying to get through our lives in some bumbling manner. Maybe not all of us are as bad as Orme but we all have our faults. So in a sense we read on. An entertainment? Perhaps. A moral lesson? Probably not. One can dig deep or can remain shallow. His words are brilliant (shiny), seductive and very powerful. We are caught in the trance before he steals away our time. But we can remember scenes, phrases (painter painster) or just the pain, the love, the sorrow, the tryst, the words, the novel.

He's still a thief though. He doesn't steal for money \u2013 it's the thrill that attracts him. He feels it's essential that his thefts are noticed or they don't count as theft. Usually it's small things he steals \u2013 a figurine, a tie-pin. But nine months ago, he stole his friend's wife, and now that theft is about to be discovered.This is Olly's own story, told directly to the reader in the form of a narrative being written as events unfold. The tone starts off light and progressively darkens, but there is a delicious vein of humour throughout the book, observational sometimes, self-deprecatory at others. Olly is a narcissist, but his ability to admit his faults with a kind of saucy twinkle makes him an endearing character. For all his knowingness, he is child-like in his lack of understanding of other people, and over the course of the book he will learn that the people close to him know him considerably better than he knows them. \nWhat I really wanted to do was to kiss her lips, to lick her eyelids, to dart the tip of my tongue into the pink and secret volutes of her ear. I was in a state of heady amazement, at myself, at Polly, at what we were, at what we had all at once become. It was as if a god had reached down from that sky of stars and scooped us up in his hand and made a little constellation of us on the spot.\nThere isn't much plot in the book \u2013 an affair that becomes known, and its aftermath on the people involved. Normally I hate books that are light on plot, but the sheer enjoyment of reading Banville's luscious prose and wickedly perceptive characterisation kept me fully engaged. Olly's style is discursive and untidy, digressing mid-thought back to his past and then just as suddenly jumping off to discuss his style of painting or his thoughts on stealing. But underneath Olly's meanderings Banville is keeping tight control \u2013 all of Olly's detours and reminiscences serve Banville's central purpose, to gradually reveal to the reader all the complexities of the flawed and weak, but rather charming, character of Olly himself. \nWhat I saw, with jarring clarity, was that there is no such thing as woman. Woman, I realised, is a thing of legend, a phantasm who flies through the world, settling here and there on this or that unsuspecting mortal female, whom she turns, briefly but momentously, into an object of yearning, veneration and terror.\nOne doesn't have to wonder if Olly is an unreliable narrator, since he tells us frequently that he is. He openly uses false names of the Happy Families variety for the incidental people he meets \u2013 Mr Hanley the Haberdasher, etc - and embellishes remembered conversations to make them sound more interesting, but then owns up to it. This all adds to the feeling of him as being child-like, an innocent... but then we also know he's intelligent and untrustworthy, so what are we to believe? He spends much time trying to work out why he can no longer paint, but the reader feels the answer might not be as complex as he likes to think. Even the world he describes has a mild air of unreality to it \u2013 solar flares and meteor showers, a world rather crumbling round the edges. It's almost as if the time is not exactly now or else the world is not exactly this one \u2013 or perhaps it's a projection of Olly's narcissism, that when his life is disrupted, the whole world shakes in sympathy.\nHow well I remember her face, which is a foolish claim to make, since any face, especially a child's, is in a gradual but relentless process of change and development, so that what I carry in my memory can be only a version of her, a generalisation of her, that I have fashioned for myself, as an evanescent keepsake.\nIt's only when he talks of a past tragedy in his life that one feels the truth of this man is within grasp. But then he will quickly spin away again, complicating his life more and more, and though he pictures himself as suffering, it's hard not to feel he is enjoying this drama of his own creation, perhaps hiding in it. Even his frequent self-criticism is just another aspect of his overwhelming narcissism \u2013 so long as Olly can talk about himself, one feels he will weather any storm.This is the first of Banville's books that I have read, and I loved it. Looking at reviews from people who are familiar with his earlier books, there's a suggestion that this one doesn't have as much substance as they do. That may very well be true \u2013 I would agree that, other than Olly's character, there's nothing particularly original or profound here. But it's the language! The fabulous prose! I could forgive a lot to someone who makes me enjoy every word, whether deeply meaningful or dazzlingly light. And Banville dazzled me while Olly entertained me \u2013 I'll happily settle for that.NB This book was provided for review by the publisher, Penguin Books UK.www.fictionfanblog.wordpress.com"}, {"userName": "switterbug (Betsey)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2843912-switterbug-betsey", "userReview": "Irish writer John Banville is known for his dark humor, patrician irony, and baroque, (but searing) prose. You don't read him for plot, and the story/characters are sometimes self-referential, or meta- sized; he will refer to characters or concerns that poke at previous novels, or even subtly refer to himself as he is perceived by other writers or critics. This is one novelist, I believe, whose novels can't be fully valued in isolation. To wholly appreciate Banville is to read his entire oeuvre. However, this is a review of just one Banville novel by a reviewer who has read only some of his books. I can only give you this limited lens; for those of you who have read his entire works, please excuse my inadequacies.THE BLUE GUITAR is a portrait of Oliver Orme, a short, squat, married, middle-aged man, an inveterate pilferer of other people's things, and a poacher of another man's wife. Over the years, Oliver has morphed from an artist of some fame to a self-serving egoist who now calls himself the \"painster,\" because he feels failed and frustrated as an artist. He's a navel-gazer, a confessor to the reader, a solipsistic bag of gusty, restless wind, a man who runs away when the heat is on him, but is yet sympathetic. Long ago, he and his wife lost their three-year-old daughter to illness. He's a man falling down, and a thief who hasn't been caught. Acquisition, art, loss, and grief, and the power of the imagination to transform reality--these are the themes I take away from this novel.Throughout the book, Orme describes repeatedly, in forensic prose, the reason he quit painting. It boils down to his frustrating attempts to get to the essence of what he paints. He is obsessed with that liminal, ungraspable place between the material world and the representation of it, and it extends to his greater philosophy of experience, and his inability to find sanctuary and inner resolve. Oliver steals objects he doesn't need in order to reactivate the object's luminescence (essence), asserting that these objects have lost their glow, and lie inert in the owner's hands. He believes that when he \"purloins\" them, he transforms the impotent object with a renewed vitality.\"It's as if a single thing by being stolen were on the instant made in two: the thing that before was someone else's and this not quite identical thing that now is mine. It's a kind of...transubstantiation...\"Oliver ponders concepts that link love and stealing, or art and love, or sometimes stealing and loss. Throughout this vacillating narrative, and the protagonist's agitated wheedling, Banville brilliantly pivots from the jocular to the melancholy, as the hapless Oliver waxes wildly about his indiscretions--\"I did steal her, picked her up when her husband wasn't looking, and popped her in my pocket. Yes, I pinched Polly; Polly I purloined.\" Almost imperceptibly, though, the author can segue from playful to melancholy, the restive Oliver arrested by loss. \"Everything seemed hollow, hollow and weightless, like those brittle casings of themselves that dead wasps leave on window-sills at the dusty end of summer. Grief was flat, in other words, a flat dull empty ache.\"And of his sequestration to his childhood home, Oliver laments: \"Here it is forever the past, here I am stalled, stilled here, cocooned; I need never move again until the moment comes for the great and final shift.\"The book is a dissection of Oliver through Oliver's fractured psyche, and a potent perception of art. He's an unreliable narrator who nevertheless reveals by dissembling, his voice a fallen mask. \"How treacherous language is, more slippery even than paint.\" Panic and sorrow underscore Oliver's trenchant memories, even when he tries to play the bumbling foil.In the first half, once Oliver's persona was established, I felt that that the author lingered a bit too much, and the pace became static, the narrative redundant. The prose was unparalleled, outstanding, but at times I felt that Banville indulged in his verbal linguistics and left the reader exhausted with his doomed protagonist. However, he gradually brought me back to the story. Although contemporary, I felt like I was in the midst of a Victorian setting--perhaps in a painting by his fictional painter, Jean Vaublin, whose name is a quasi-anagram of his own. But, even when Banville is writing for himself, I'll wait for him in the gloaming."}, {"userName": "Carolyn Francis", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21474918-carolyn-francis", "userReview": "Perhaps this novel is more intelligent than I am.

But here the plot is not important. Instead of plot substitute character, narration, and structure.Banville\u2019s use of language is second to none writing today. He crawls so wonderfully into his narrator that one is almost embarrassed to be reading his thoughts and memories. I think of Quentin in Faulkner. almost expecting him to scream out, \u201cDid you ever have a sister?\u201dLikewise, his use of metaphor is that of a poet. And a good one, be it William Carlos Williams or T.S. Eliot. His sentences sing from a simple chanson to a mighty aria. He writes in a structure that is concrete and exploratory. But that language soars, swoons and brings Nabokov and Beckett alive once moreAlthough his character of Oliver is non-sensual, he makes us see in the most sensual and visual of ways. His references to colors and painters intrigues and completes his thoughts and make the reader see. His words have meaning and his novel reverberates with both ennui and action. He leaves us at the end with a character not defeated, but mighty beaten up.

Banville is an author who requires long periods of recuperation for his readers between books. A few weeks ago, I reviewed the beautiful Everyman edition of Banville's \nThe Book of Evidence\n and The Sea. Coming to him then, after a gap of several years, I was struck how well his florid gourmet style played against his subjects in each case, the one justifying the other. But this time, the style seems merely self-indulgent, and the story\u2014a warming-over of all-too-familiar tropes\u2014quite insufficient to justify it.Style, first. Here's the end of one paragraph from early in the book and the start of the one following:\u2026But that's not nature, strictly speaking, is it? What, then? It's the all, the omnium, that I'm thinking of; the whole kit and boodle, mice and mountain ranges, and us, wedged in between, the measure of all things, God bless the mark, as they say in these parts.There's nothing to eat in the house. What am I to do? I could go out into the wood, I suppose, and forage for sweet herbs, or delve for pig nuts, whatever they are.\u2026He's a wizard with words, no mistake. And there are times when he says something that is not merely clever but actually penetrating, as when he describes love as \"being let into a place that she had been hitherto alone in.\" But usually you are just aware of the dexterity of his word-juggling, his fondness for obscure words: \"the borborygmic blarings of a three-piece band\" for example. And then there are the give-aways: \"as they say in these parts\" (not for the past 60 years they haven't) or \"pig nuts, whatever they are\" (if you don't know, why say it?). It gets exhausting very quickly.And who is this monomaniac bent on enthralling us with his confessional monologue? Another of Banville's stock characters, an over-cultured middle-aged failure, Oliver Otway Orme, former painter and petty thief, offering us his memories of childhood, false-modest glimpses of his sexual escapades, and a meditation on his sorry state generally. Somewhere in there are would-be-profound thoughts on the act of appropriation, the way the artist and the pilferer both take from their surroundings, but I couldn't be bothered to disentangle them. All I saw was a pathetic adulterer describing an affair with his best friend's wife, glorifying both his lust and his cowardly desertion as though it were some Roman de geste. His ability to put his navel-gazing into flowery language does not make the lint any more edifying."}, {"userName": "Deborah Pickstone", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37849334-deborah-pickstone", "userReview": "I now see why John Banville is admired as a writer. I had only read his Benjamin Black incarnation and was not impressed with Quirke. This is written very much as a stream of consciousness in whatever point in time he is at (this moves) and provides an interesting picture of a very human and fallible human being who is in many ways unlikeable for his actions but remains likeable withal. There were moments when I just stopped to think about a perspective new to me or just to play with the words used in my own head. It was often an uncomfortable read - don't we always, necessarily, identify with the protagonist, especially in first person? So, I constantly questioned myself as to what I would have done - or what I did and faced some truths that were - not the ideal picture I think we would all like to see of ourselves. I have never had the facility for self-delusion which seems to come in so handy for some, so at least my hard answers were not a surprise! I don't find it made any difference that I am female, either - though I don't believe there is any real difference between men and women, myself; any that appear to exist are socially manufactured, not innate. My identification with him, though, was intensified by him being a painter - and a painter who has lost his impetus to paint, at that - quel horreur! It doesn't matter to me whether I am any good at it - but it does matter that I want to do it and believe I can try to achieve what I can conceive.The most striking statement of all that this novel made - to me - was that our uniqueness lies in our idiosyncratic, personal viewpoint on any experience we have and that no-one will ever see x in exactly my way again once I am dead. And that occurred to me to be the generative energy behind the impulse to create. The main theme seemed to me to be other than what was presented; ultimately it is a story of grief, buried and barely acknowledged. The child seemed to me to be why he couldn't paint, not all the reasons that he gave repeatedly. And the ending confirmed me in this view. But that is great writing, no? When several people can see completely differing perspectives and believe each of them is the heart of the meaning: or perhaps all of them are? This is a great writer; his use of language is masterly. Perhaps the narrator is fairly emotionless (he appears to have trouble understanding his emotions or even identifying that they exist) and perhaps this is intentional - but this was the missing piece for me and why 4 stars. His emotional stuntedness was at the level of severely dysfunctional and he appeared to lack any grasp of empathy."}, {"userName": "Debbie Robson", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1743317-debbie-robson", "userReview": "There has been a lot written lately about the difficulty of reading John Banville. A writer for the New Yorker recently pointed out that his books are actually prose poems. I would agree. I have now read five novels by Banville, The Sea, The Ancient Light trilogy and this latest The Blue Guitar. I have some advice to offer that I even had to remind myself of, whilst reading The Blue Guitar. Don\u2019t expect a lot of plot. There just isn\u2019t much in a John Banville. Expect him to go off at a tangent (or what appears to be a tangent). It really isn\u2019t. Banville is about moments of being (like Woolf) and examining very closely our domestic lives and that\u2019s what I love about him. He has the ability to make me smile more often than most writers. He\u2019s particularly good with objects and landscape. And of course the strange condition of being human. Here\u2019s an example of Banville\u2019s wonderfully skewed view of an object, imbued as it is with a particular character\u2019s thoughts - in this instance our very self indulgent narrator, Olive Orme:\u201c....I recalled the empty brandy bottle Marcus had dropped on the floor.

I hear its passionate song, limpid and bright. Do birds sing at this late time of year? Maybe their kind also has its bards, its rhapsodes, its solitary poets of desolation and lament, who know no seasons. The day wanes, the night comes on, soon I\u2019ll have to light my lamp. For now, though, I am content to sit here in the October gloaming, brooding on my loves, my losses, my paltry sins. What\u2019s to become of me, of my dry, my desiccated, heart?

Consumed within himself, fraught with unconscionable betrayals while pandering to his other art of thievery.Soon though I tired of this contemptible creep who gained entry into my home, no matter how beautific the prose, and the winsome strategy of one offsetting the other.

The perfectly placed prose now revealing the substance its sheen had covered. Him telling and my listening, the simmering tension felt beneath. A tension growing taut with the rise of fragility, a fragility wrought from a crushing abandonment permeating the abandonments he disclosed on the sofa in his own way, that he both suffered and doled out.A lesson in brute blood splattered hurt and harm revealed within the interstices of paced lofty prose conjuring the hurt that much more painful. When done we both knew it was time for him to leave, grateful for each others company. By the opened door I thanked him for excusing my gruff behavior when he first arrived and how truly glad I was that in the end he stayed and told me all he did.

He's self-centred, self-obsessed and careless of other people's feelings and the lives around him that he is destroying. He returns to his home town which, in typical Banville style, could be anywhere on the coast of Britain and at during any time period in the last 60 years, and slowly disintegrates into apathy. When we meet him, he can no longer paint, and he has just started an affair with his best friend's wife. His own wife, Gloria, is still grieving for the death of their child several years before, but Oliver's awareness of his wife seems to be limited to those aspects of her which relate specifically to him.Because this story is told in the first person, one feels trapped inside Orme's head and his ceaseless voice seems to crowd you and drown you. Banville is an incredibly skilled writer - his use of language is just magnificent and his choice of vocabulary, often obscure, always both intelligent and highly literary, suits the character of Orme to a tee. But I felt exhausted and still somewhat outside of the characters as I read, despite being intimately familiar with the narrator. And therein lies the skill, as Orme himself is so very detached from the world around him that most people seem to be little more than pawns in a game that he is desperately playing with himself. The writing is beautiful, the story is tragic and the character of Oliver Orme is pitiful and memorable. I also loved the nod towards The Sea, as I love when an author slips in some intertextuality. Despite my discomfort with Mr Orme himself, I really enjoyed this book."}], "description": "John Banville, the Man Booker Prize\u2013winning author of The Sea and Ancient Light, now gives us a new novel - at once trenchant, witty, and shattering - about the intricacies of artistic creation, about theft, and about the ways in which we learn to possess one another, and to hold on to ourselvesEqually self-aggrandizing and self-deprecating, our narrator, Oliver Otway Orme (\"O O O.
