This collection of short stories was interesting because the author lived in Tangier, Morocco for many years... but that's about all that makes the book. I didn't find any brilliance in the descriptions or the construction, and so became slightly disinterested with the narratives. Of the collected stories, my favorite was the first. Entitled 'Midnight Mass', the narrative revolved around an adult visiting his childhood home during Christmas."}, {"userName": "M.T.

The discovery last week of the short story collection Midnight Mass, with the familiar Black Sparrow paperback binding - earthy tan with green, purple block print - was thus an emotional experience.Immediately I was flooded by memories and thoughts of the man I considered my favorite author from the time I discovered him in '87, the summer I got my first tattoo, until his death at the end of the last century.Instantly, too, in that powerful way that great literature connects us with the world we are in, I remembered myself experiencing his works: where I was, the effect it had upon me. The empowerment and awe I felt after finishing one of his short stories or novels: blown away.Paul Bowles was a huge influence on me as a writer and thinker. He was one of the most powerful allies in my struggle with immigration to the United States and in philosophical discourse in Europe. That he wrote from the subconscious as described by his wife, Jane, was the most romantic and amazing concept to me when I was young and I longed to be able to do that - not to understand it, but to do it.The utter irrationality of the Western project, the neoliberal insanity we have all endured so long, was exposed by Bowles and then swiftly and violently shattered by the reality of life among the desert people of North Africa. In other works, a slow and seemingly disconnected series of events between locals in a village would be described with such lucidity and simplicity that the differences in thinking between east and west were made suddenly crystalline in the end - hits you like a koan.The collision of culture was total and instead of Coca-Cola and the Golden Arches mowing down the village, the puny, minuscule westerners melted away in the heat of the Saharan sun, driven mad.Midnight Mass is the last collection of Bowles' short stories published by Black Sparrow and features at its center the elegant, drifting, rootless novella Here To Learn, a gorgeous story about a girl from North Africa who just keeps moving buoyed by her beauty, her wit and her ability to learn quickly how to negotiate the West.The collection starts with the titular story, Midnight Mass, one of Bowles' incredible parties; the Nazarenes careening around in their expatriated stupor of drinking, carousing and complaining, the locals bursting with romance only to become suddenly something else - the change of face.There are stories about the locals and their fantastic, sometimes circuitous logic and its culmination in a kind of basic justice. There are tales about the utter undoing of our perception of a shared understanding of this world.At the Krungthep Plaza is an amazing story set as the U.S. President is due to pass through a certain North African village. The machinations behind the scenes and the conflicts between locals, expats and the security teams are expertly related, culminating in a wild effusion of emotions that I can only described as angst against the way things are now.It's all just so great. I miss Paul Bowles.(sigh)"}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/258790-rebecca", "userReview": "Refreshingly unAmerican."}, {"userName": "Will", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/161077-will", "userReview": "In this latest (and last) collection of his short works, Bowles remains a master of prose and intimate of North African culture. What his earlier stories had, however, and which these sadly lack is a sense of immediacy and discomfort. The characters in \"Midnight Mass\" are almost always in their own element, as it were, and seem rarely at the mercy of their adoptive cultural landscape. Thus, the sense of danger is erased, along with much of the tension.Not only are these stories bland, then, but also heavily post-colonial in their treatment of native habits. I never thought I'd see Bowles actually do this, based on what I'd read before, all of which had been written long before this collection. In these stories, ex-pats don't often find themselves so much at the life-or-death mercy of their environs as they do at the point of mere, harmless confusion.In short, the stakes just aren't as high, and the pages don't turn as quickly. The prose is masterful, but in the way that his characters seem to reminisce a more far-flung frontier from an earlier and wilder time, Bowles himself seems more to reminisce here the fact that he's not putting them there anymore."}, {"userName": "trivialchemy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/108138-trivialchemy", "userReview": "Unfortunately, Bowles has less of a mastery over the short story as he does over the novel. His stories feel emulative of really great short stories (such as Hemingway's terse masterpieces), without actually being great. By that I mean they seem to have all the right characteristics: the same self-assured cadence, the same immediacy of character, the same revelatory but incomplete resolutions -- but somehow fail to be especially interesting or, more to the point, emotionally engaging."}, {"userName": "metaphor", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5685453-metaphor", "userReview": "Hell is only for people who haven't suffered enough here.*She shut her eyes and sat quietly, feeling that she had gone much too far away- so far that now she was nowhere.

But could definitely have been better. After the experience of reading Bowles' \"The Sheltering Sky\", this collection of short stories failed to match up to the initial expectation. Set primarily in northern Africa, these stories just scratch the surface of the characters without doing much justice to the possibilities of making more out of them."}, {"userName": "Christa", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2073597-christa", "userReview": "Not a huge fan of his stuff.
