It is true that the narrator is pompous, idiotic, and boring. He is also written about in a flat way, and it's difficult to feel any empathy for him. I believe this is intentional, however, and it demonstrates the author's skill. The protagonist moves from being a \"bore\" to an audacious oaf, to a despicable human being. The book is written in memoir form, and the fact that the entire novel is written from only his point of view demonstrates how shallow he is as a man. No other character is developed; very little is seen of the numerous people because the narrator has a microscope through which he views them...how he can get \"all he ever wanted.\" A bit of irony exists in that the man is journaling his life but there is little, if any, introspection. This beauty of this book is subtle; the little action that occurs is retold without emotion, but it's still a fulfilling, if frustrating, read."}, {"userName": "bookyeti", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1679352-bookyeti", "userReview": "Never judge a book by its...titleNever having the pleasure of reading any of Shreve\u2019s works prior to delving into \u201cAll He Ever Wanted\u201d, I admittedly formed an unfair and premature opinion of the novel based on its somewhat flimsy melodramatic title. However, I was soon to discover that it is definitely a fitting and descriptive cover for the thespian narrative that unravels within. I was also taken unaware that this was a period piece, set in New England in the early part of the 20th Century - a fact I was all too happy to uncover, as I am an aficionado of period works.\u201cAll He Ever Wanted\u201d is a heart-wrenching account of unrequited love, obsession, jealousy and betrayal; exploring the most intense (and at times, darkest) workings of the human heart. Dreary and rather depressing, this candid narrative painstakingly chronicles a marriage of convenience gone sadly awry. It is written in the voice of Nicholas van Tassel, an English literary professor at a small college in New England as he ponders upon the memories of his fateful past\u2026 One harrowing evening after escaping a restaurant fire, van Tassel happens upon the striking Etna Bliss and is instantaneously enraptured. Here commences their somewhat stifled and confusing courtship. Ultimately, their marriage forces each character to make critical compromises that will change their lives forever: Man gives up romantic ideal of marriage (knowing full well his wife does not love him) if only to \u2018possess\u2019 her for himself; Woman relinquishes hope of marrying someone she loves and settles instead for a man who offers her freedom and a degree of independence (which is ultimately counterfeit).Although the story is a little slow and one-dimensional at the outset, as the plot proceeds the reader will be taken in by the rich detail and character definition that quickly develops. The letters between certain characters were also a nice touch, allowing a glimpse into their personal thoughts - a unique perspective for the reader, digressing temporarily from the narrator\u2019s recital. All in all, I must say I was thoroughly impressed by Shreve\u2019s shrewd portrayal of affections not reciprocated in \u201cAll He Ever Wanted\u201d\u2026it is a theme all too familiar in the human game of love.- review for Time Warner books"}, {"userName": "Crandall", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/229429-crandall", "userReview": "soooooooo boring.

However, i stuck with it, and was so glad that i did. This book is a fascinating examination of the general mores and attitudes of the late Victorian era - - - i say this because i feel that the leading character, Nicholas Van Tassel, is very much a product of that time rather than the era in which the narrative actually occurs. When one translates the Victorian Era to a stiff and stilted New England college town, disaster occurs. Actually set from the late 1890's through the early 1930's, it is also a tale of how a man's obsession can lead him to unspeakable acts, both in his personal life and in his career. The genius of the author is that one can still feel such pity for such a flawed and, in Nicholas' own words (for he is our narrator) \"foolish man\". One likewise feels pity for his wife, Etna, who is also a real, flesh and blood character - - -not some irreproachable heroine, but a human being with flaws of her own. Many people on this board have complained of the writing - - since this is a narrative by Nicholas, i thought it to be brilliant. Every word he says only serves to reinforce who and what the man is, and how he reflects the overall thinking of his day."}, {"userName": "Melinda Chadwick", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/147228-melinda-chadwick", "userReview": "Yeah, I don't enjoy books about manipulative assholes."}, {"userName": "Cindy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70176-cindy", "userReview": "As my reviews always include spoilers, I am warning the reader now. This book was aptly titled. It quite literally is about the things that he wanted and what he did to get them. The book reads like a memoir as Van Tessal narrates to the reader his love affair with Etna Bliss. Interwoven with this story is his own admonitions, opinions, and current status on a train to Florida to attend his sister's funeral. It truly is a heartbreaking story, just tragic, and lonely. Questions abound but are, for the most part, answered by novel's end.Van Tessal, professor at Thrupp college, assists a Mrs. Bliss and niece, Etna, after a fire ravages the Hotel restaurant they were just dining at. He falls immediately in love, literally consumed by his feelings for her, and pursues this lukewarm companion at all costs. Etna, admittedly cool, marries him but is honest with her husband. She does not love him and makes no promises to do so. She only promises to fulfill her duties as wife. They wed, create a family (a son an daughter), and live companionably. This is of course until a fateful series of events some fifteen years later. Van Tessal grows threatened in his career by an Asher, who will later also threaten his home. He learns that his wife has her own home away from home. She has procured a cottage. Throughout the novel, it is clear that all Etna hopes for in her life is freedom. This home offers her an innocent way to get this but Van Tessal cannot abide by this apparently unconventional and morally questionable act. He hastily asks for a divorce and Etna agrees. Though Van Tessal's obsession prompts him to beg for her return, she refuses and Van Tessal goes to such a length to procur exactly what he wants. Upset that Asher has his coveted job and that he may now be making advances to his separated wife, he sets his daughter to make accusations of molestation against this very innocent man. Van Tessal relays this all in the story, ashamed and guilty but at the same time with this hint of self righteousness, almost as if he excuses his behavior because of his \"humanness.\" In any event, Etna is destroyed by this and returns home. Clara later reveals the truth, Etna is heartbroken (she learns that Philip is fighting overseas in WWI and never had his name cleared), Van Tessal rapes her, and she leaves never to return. Van Tessal laters learns of the growing intimate relationship between his wife and Phillip, learns of the backstory between Etna and Phillip's brother Samuel from years before though he fills in the blanks for the reader as we do not have Etna's voice to lend information, and he loses his daughter who believes he murdered their mother. At the time of writing, he was attending the funeral of the sister who had taken Clara under her wing and hoping to speak to a child that he hadn't spoken to in 18 years! This is a lengthy synopsis but necessary in order to explain my opinion. Etna obviously made a mistake in marrying but she can hardly be blamed. She was honest from the beginning about her inability to love her husband. She was honest about her interest in education and in her own freedom. Given the time period, marriage was really the only option and, since she knew she could never really love another and could not be with this person, she did what she thought she could to make another happy, to marry that which loved her to an obsession. At the turn of the twentieth century, she could do little else. Her only other option was to be a governess to her neices/nephews. At the very least, she could be the mistress of her own home. Her secret home, though perhaps unconventional, was her only price for this mockery of a marriage. I don't blame her leaving either. She had been betrayed by her husband, her daughter, and unfortunately she would not have retained custody. To be free of her husband, she had to leave.And, onto Van Tassel, he is a redeemable character through much of the novel. In fact, one feels for this man who is so desperately in love. His anti-semitism, apparently common, was not to be respected but he was a good husband an father. This was until he grew so desperate and malicious. From the day he proposed and wed Etna, his thoughts were only on himself. Love means wanting the other person happy. This was not love but an immature desire, a selfishness. Simply because this is natural does not excuse him whatsoever. It was his actions that have broken up his family and possibly destroyed the life of Phillip, forever tainted by said accusation and whose life we know not what happened. Again I repeat that he might be \"forgiven\" for those human weaknesses had he seemed more repetent. His guilt was certainly evident but I feel more like he was upset that he didn't succeed, that Etna did not stay, instead of upset wtih his actions. The sheer act of writing eludes to ownership of his activities but his words belie this notion. Anyway, very bittersweet, heartbreaking, disturbing, and a lesson for many."}, {"userName": "Stephanie ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1007476-stephanie", "userReview": "Wow. she did a great job making the protagonist a real person, someone whose obsessive desire to own HIS wife gave me claustrophobia just to read it.Also a nice satire on academia, mixed in.

I used to come home with my shirt smudged black till I found a solution. But now, no matter how many times I remind my colleagues that I'm wearing a \"manly smock,\" they insist on calling it an \"apron.\"Enjoying a novel by Anita Shreve puts me in a similarly defensive mood. I realize this raises a couchful of insecurities that can't be resolved in a book review, but it goes to the heart of Shreve's popularity with some readers - and her rejection by others. During the past 14 years, she's created a fan base that sends each of her novels to the bestseller list, first in hardback, then in paperback. Oprah helped, of course, by selecting \"The Pilot's Wife\" in 1998 for her massive club, but that coveted seal also reinforced Shreve's reputation as a \"women's novelist.\"To the extent that that's a put-down, it's unfortunate because what's remarkable about her best work is the way she hovers so tantalizingly between serious history and syrupy romance - between the portrayal of making textiles in New Hampshire and heaving breasts in red satin. Both lines of inquiry are fascinating, of course, but no one manages to straddle them as successfully as Shreve. Admittedly, there are missteps now and then, but usually, as in her new novel, she gets it just right.\"All He Ever Wanted\" begins with fire in ice - a cataclysm that consumes a hotel on a freezing winter night. This disaster is a perfect metaphor for the passion ignited that evening in the heart of Nicholas Van Tassel, a cold professor of rhetoric at an undistinguished New England college. Tassel begins his memoir here, the first time he saw Etna Bliss, staring at the flames they had both barely escaped. In a moment, he falls desperately in love, escorts her safely home, and dedicates his life to possessing her.He's a creepy narrator, and the circumstances of this memoir - a confession to his son while traveling by train to his sister's funeral - only heighten the macabre atmosphere. He speaks in a stilted, formal manner, infected with the pretensions of academia, but he's visited by painful moments of self-consciousness that make him confess how pompous and ridiculous he is. The effect, so well engineered by Shreve, is strangely engaging, eliciting feelings of revulsion and sympathy as Nicholas describes a life consumed by jealousy.His obsession with Miss Bliss - he can't help making puns on her name or apologizing for his sophomoric wordplay - inspires all the usual stratagems of romance: He calls on her, brings her lovely gifts, and asks her for walks.\"I wanted to lay down my new cloak so that her feet might not be sullied by the dirty snow, but of course I could not - not only for the seeming excess of the gesture, which might frighten away any sane women, but also for the sheer impracticality of doing so at continuous intervals.\" Talk about a wild and crazy guy!Alarmed by his strange-fitting happiness, Nicholas nevertheless behaves in every way like the besotted gentleman he is: \"I shed, in those few months, the dull persona of the professor in favor of the more impassioned demeanor of the suitor.\" Throughout their very formal courtship, Etna is always polite and eager to get away from her suffocating aunt and uncle, but at some level, Nicholas suspects that she does not love him. That suspicion grows stronger when Etna says, \"I do not love you.\"Nicholas is pained by her candor, but remains convinced that she will learn to love him. And in the meantime, he points out with cool calculation, he's offering the only probable escape from a life of spinsterhood and financial dependence on her relatives.This could hardly have been an unusual bargain at the time, and Shreve explores the emotional costs on both sides with real sympathy and historical precision.Nicholas is a pompous bore, to be sure, but he's also devoted to his new wife. He provides a lovely home, and he encourages her freedom to pursue various interests. For her part, Etna raises two happy children and supports her husband's professional ambitions, but her affection for him never deepens. She remains committed to maintaining a room of her own and a degree of emotional and physical distance that continues to scratch his heart.Meanwhile, Nicholas finds his passions similarly thwarted at the college. Through her portrayal of this modest liberal arts school, Shreve includes a wonderful background plot about the transformation of American higher education: the jarring rise of athletics, the shift toward professional degrees, and the corrosive influence of wealthy patrons. It's just the sort of substantive historical context that always runs beneath Shreve's romantic thrills.Driven by domestic and professional ambitions, Nicholas takes a series of small steps that eventually lead to some giant moral lapses, and finally a monstrous plot of deception to win back his wife and ascend to the dean's office. In the tradition of a classic fable, he gets all he ever wanted - and everything he deserves.Shreve takes some real risks here, not only by focusing on the villain but by speaking through him, forcing a long-suffering woman, the center of several of her most successful novels, to remain obscured and distant. It's another indication of the breadth of her talent, and another reason to keep her from being trapped in the kitchen.http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0417/p1..."}, {"userName": "Scott", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/756648-scott", "userReview": "When I started reading this book I thought, \u201cOK, I\u2019m not getting through this one.

The narrator of the story is recounting his past while en route to his sister\u2019s funeral. Bachelor Nicholas Van Tassel is a stuffy professor at a snotty boys' school who is inside the hotel when the blaze begins but leaves unscathed. During this tragedy where twenty people perish in a fiery death he meets the woman of his dreams Etna Bliss.Etna\u2019s \u201chandsome\u201d face, her lovely waist and her other womanly attributes haunt his every thought. Even her name, Bliss, brings lusty thoughts to his mind and starts my skin to crawling. His infatuation is all consuming and before long he pursues her with all of the gusto of a starving dog drooling over a choice bit of meat. She eventually agrees to a date where he learns, a bit to his dismay, that she has a brain as well as fine breasts and is surprisingly literate. They read stories together and seem to get along well enough but when he makes a move or turns the conversation towards the personal she immediately gives him the cold shoulder. I should add that Nicholas is described as the most un-athletic man on earth with a slight paunch and a balding pate. The sexual attraction seems entirely one-sided and a bit creepy. At this point I would\u2019ve put the book aside unfinished as I found Nicholas Van Tassel boring beyond belief and far too pompous for his own good. However, since I was listening to this in its unabridged format and I was stuck in traffic I continued to torture myself with Nicholas Van Tassel\u2019s words (expertly read by a narrator who reads in a purposely haughty way).Despite the fact that Etna does not return his feelings of undying love he insists that they marry and, oddly enough, she agrees. Thus begins their awkward life together. During their years of marriage they parent two children which, thankfully, we are spared the oogey details of their sterile love making. Thank you Mr. Van Tassel for speedily skipping by those bits and saving me a few shudders! They seem to get along decently enough as they plod along through their days. Nicholas gives Etna a nice life and the freedom to do whatever she wishes but sadly the love Nicholas aches for is never returned by Etna. Nicholas, the poor love starved sap, is grateful just to have her as his wife and doesn\u2019t complain about her complete lack of affection towards him. But things begin to change when he discovers that Etna has been hiding things from him. This is where the book finally picked up and actually engaged my full attention.At this point Nicholas almost becomes a sympathetic character though he is still remains a thoroughly unpleasant fellow. He is riddled with insecurities and although he has been married to a woman he cherished for years he will never be a happy or successful man. His world begins to spiral out of control as he simultaneously discovers Etna\u2019s been keeping secrets and learns the position he\u2019s been longing to have at the University may be forever out of his reach.Nicholas\u2019s festering jealously and over-reaction to Etna\u2019s secret -- which was odd but not nearly as devastatingly earth-shattering as I\u2019d anticipated -- ruins any smidgen of pity I may have felt for him just a few chapters earlier. Author Shreve successfully paints an unpleasant picture of a thoroughly unpleasant man caught up in a situation of his own making. Reading Nicolas Van Tassel\u2019s vitriolic comments and actions for pages on end was a depressing experience that I won\u2019t be repeating any time soon."}, {"userName": "Jacki", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1587840-jacki", "userReview": "After I read the first chapter of this book, I almost decided not to keep going.

Needless to say, I decided to give it a better chance & I got used to both of these things and was able to finish it.I think that the thing that I didn't like about this story is that the main character is so unlikable that it makes it hard to read. I felt anger towards him and just sorry for him the whole time. How obsessed and manipulative he was with his co-workers and his family was unsettling to me and I could tell that since this was is memoir, from his point of view, that we weren't getting a very fair view of what really happened. It's funny though because he's an english teacher and in the book he has a conversation about unreliable narrators. I thought that was pretty clever on the author's part.I wasn't impressed with the story, the writing, the characters, anything. It was readable and that was about it.

It is fiction written in the form of a memoir by a man who had been obsessed with his wife. I felt sorry for this man, Nicholas, for about the first two thirds of the book. I forgave him his faults when (as I see from previous reviews I\u2019ve read) others did not because it was apparent to me that this memoir is Nicholas\u2019s confession. He now sees his errors and is sorry. Later, though, I wondered: is Nicholas sorry because of what he had done or does he just feel sorry for himself.Throughout ALL HE EVER WANTED, Nicholas gives hints of the outcome. Even so, this \u201cmemoir\u201d is unpredictable. I didn\u2019t know, while I read the last third of the book, why he was writing this. Was it meant to be a memoir, a confession, or a justification for bad acts?I\u2019m afraid that some other reviewers gave this book a low rating because they found the narrator/main character to be despicable. As I see it, Anita Shreve\u2019s INTENTION was to, first, show what a sap Nicholas was and, later, horrify the reader with Nicholas\u2019s actions.

I boo'ed at Etna's agreement to marry him, but cheered when her secret cottage was revealed (though, to be clear, that whole storyline could have used about 50 more pages of development).The book is written almost as one of the early 1900s and successfully comes off as a tribute to that time--the language, the affectations, the ideas. There are some inconsistencies, but they aren't glaringly obvious.Since the story is written as Van Tassel's memoir (composed en route to a funeral in Florida), the timeline shifts inconsistently and it often becomes unclear just what is happening when. Van Tassel speculates much too much on his wife's activities and those passages read more like pseudo-Victorian porn than anything else.Overall, a decent read, especially if you've got nothing else to do.

Though the reviews of it nearly scared me away, I dove into this one and was determined to give it a shot. I'm guessing it got bad reviews because people aren't used to the protagonist being annoying and sometimes completely unlikeable.If you're a woman, you may have been pursued by a guy like this before. Women might relate with the guy so head-over-heels in love with them that they are almost disgusted with him. The narrator admits that he isn't handsome and his overeager pursuit of his love interest is cringe-worthy. But what happens when he GETS the girl? It's uncomfortable to witness, even through reading.Not only is the protagonist disagreeable, but his love interest comes across as vapid and shallow a female character as you might ever have witnessed, at first, and I actually think Shreve could have fleshed out their relationship a little more. Maybe she could have made the female character almost sympathetic by fleshing out their marriage a little more and showing how the woman felt suffocated by her too-attentive husband. While the wife's character grated on my nerves, I can also relate with wanting a retreat of your own...and it did make me think about how marriage can make independent people feel horribly trapped and stifled sometimes.The book is tough to begin, but after you get into it, you won't be able to put it down. The ending especially starts to get really interesting. I've read four Anita Shreve books down and this is DEFINTELY the best of the lot.

You can understand his naivete in hoping that with time Etna would come to love him but it was clear that that was never going to happen. And the sad thing is how much he loved her with not reciprication-- yet at the same time Etna was always upfront about that fact.

All he ever wanted was the woman he saw and wanted to marry. She did not love him, and she made that clear to him. She accepted his proposal as long he would accept that she would not love him. Can a marriage work that is not based on love? The characters and their motivations were beautifully described, and I enjoyed contemplating their lives and decisions.My husband's grandmother would have been a contemporary of the main character, and so I enjoyed thinking of his life compared to the life I imagined that she lived."}, {"userName": "Lisa Greer", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/583112-lisa-greer", "userReview": "This is the only novel by Shreve I've liked. One of my pet peeves is novels titled The X's Wife... insert male specialist where X (pilot, professor, shoe salesman, doctor, whatever) is. I mean, come on, people. We are beyond that at this point I think-- where every woman must be named as her husband's wife. What a tired convention. The whole feminist movement and men's movement for that matter has changed considerably, and I won't even read or buy a novel so named. Rant over.Anyhow, I liked this novel because the wife had a surprising secret. It was not the secret I thought she had. The setting is a small college and in the home of the couple. I think it's early 1900s."}, {"userName": "Truthmonkey", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/167768-truthmonkey", "userReview": "The main character says something at one point about this being the tale of a faintly ridiculous man, of not much interest to anybody...and I have to say that I agree.

While he hadn't had the time to compose it during his busy life as a professor and then dean at Thrupp, he did now that he was retired. That is how he decided to pass the time away as he traveled by train from his little New England town to his sister's funeral which was taking place in Florida.Sitting back in his compartment, he reflected and he wrote. Fifteen years? Where did the time go? Yet, the memory of the fire at the restaurant and the flame in his heart were still alive! Yes, it was love at first sight. No, she was not a raving beauty, but there was something about her that drew him to her. In an effort to win her, he pursued her, bought her gifts, tok her to tea, and on a wonderful sleigh ride. The more time that he spent with her, the more he imagined that she shared his ardor.Ah! but he was mistaken! Etna, herself, had told him so. \"I do not love you, Nicholoas.\" She had said it more than once. Like a lovesick fool he pursued her anyway. After all, he was a man of prestige and means. How could she refuse him? It was only when he presented himself as her savior, her knight in shing armor that she finally said, \"Yes.\"If he had asked Shakespeare, he would have heard him say,\"What fools these mortals be.\"It didn't take Van Tassel longer than his wedding night to discover that his fair damsel was not a virgin. Learning this took the wind out of his sails, but pride forced him to keep up the pretense. There were so many things that confused and taunted him: Who had been her lover? How many had there been? How could she do this to h im\" Questions, questions, questions...Years passed. Children came, and slowly Etna's past is revealed when a young, brilliant professor named Phillip Asher enters the scene. Van Tassel recognizes that he is a strong competitor for the position of dean at the college. More importantly, he senses that he represents the missing link in the mystery of Etna's past.Any modern day reader would more than likely want to give Professor Nicholas Van Tassel a good kick in the ass that would knock him to his senses. To my way of thinking if he felt that \"virginity\" was such a high priority in choosing a wife, he should have asked her if she was \"pure\" before even thinking about a proposal. On the other hand, I would suggest that he should have traveled to the Middle East to marry a Moslem!I would recommend reading, All He Ever Wanted to anyone who wishes to delve into the psychology of marital realtionships gone awry and the machinations of human nature which result in \"doubt,\" \"fear,\" and \"resentment\" which result in the breakup of a family. Lastly, what this novel recommends is tnat persons should avoid marrying someone that they do not truly and deeply love.Good advice. Wouldn't you say?"}, {"userName": "Christina Wilder", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7617384-christina-wilder", "userReview": "The limits that society used to set on women are brought to life in historical fiction novels, which place the characters in the past and illuminate their struggles against the backdrop of a world that had not seen the fruition of the feminist movement. Strong women being subdued by men is not an uncommon theme for novels in general, and in three popular historical fiction books the women in question face overwhelming odds and find their own way to battle for independence, justice, and love.Nicholas Van Tassel, the protagonist of Anita Shreve's \"All He Ever Wanted\", sees Etna Bliss after they have both escaped a fire during a dinner party and is immediately entranced with her. His obsession drives him to court her, and it is obvious from the beginning that Etna does not have the same feelings for Nicholas, and this, combined with the fact that the story is told from Nicholas's point of view so that we have a full understanding of the depths of his infatuation, the reader sympathizes with Nicholas.At first.When he finally wins Etna over and they marry, Nicholas believes that through his uxorious affection he will cause her to love him back. As the book progresses, however, we learn the depths of his obsession and the unforgivable actions that are caused by it. We also learn of Etna's past and her secrets from her husband, and by the time the novel unfolds we learn of the couple's fate and the true nature of their marriage, and the effects of this nature on their two children. \"All He Ever Wanted\" is a story about obsessive love, possession, and independence set in a time when women were not afforded the freedoms they have today."}], "description": "\"A marriage is always two intersecting stories.\" This realization comes perhaps too late to the husband of Etna Bliss-a man whose obsession with his young wife begins at the moment of their first meeting, as he helps Etna and her companions escape from a fire in a hotel restaurant, and culminates in a marriage doomed by secrets and betrayal. Written with the intelligence and grace that are the hallmarks of Anita Shreve's bestselling novels, this gripping tale of desire, jealousy, and loss is peopled by unforgettable characters as real as the emotions that bring them together.", "title": "All He Ever Wanted", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/443540.All_He_Ever_Wanted", "average": 3.19, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1504700179l/443540.jpg", "reviews": 969, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3530.Anita_Shreve", "name": "Anita Shreve"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Historical", "Romance", "Womens Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/443540.All_He_Ever_Wanted", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/984584.All_He_Ever_Wanted", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10818708-all-he-ever-wanted", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7598074-all-he-ever-wanted", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6982866-all-he-ever-wanted", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5191.The_Pilot_s_Wife", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89399.Fortune_s_Rocks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14965.Light_on_Snow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/228534.The_Weight_of_Water", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3121162-testimony", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
