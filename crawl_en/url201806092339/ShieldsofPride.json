She sets the story during the time of Henry the Young King\u2019s rebellion against his father, Henry II, and while it details the romance between a reputable mercenary and a widow with a gloomy past, what stirred up in me is the memory of reading Sharon Kay Penman\u2019s Devil's Brood and the antipathy I\u2019d harbored towards this particular bunch of ungrateful Plantagenet brats because of it, and it\u2019s never a good thing to dwell on from a book like this one that should be, by rights, light and romantic."}, {"userName": "Misfit", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1375548-misfit", "userReview": "Not the author's best, but still a good read. Although in my opinion Chadwick's second best is heads and tails above most of the rest. One of Chadwick's earlier books, this is the story of mercenary Joscelin de Gael, the illegitimate son of a promient knight and Linnet de Montsorrel. Linnet's abusive husband dies in an accident and Joscelin is given the care of Linnet's holdings and young son, and marries her. The story then focuses on the after affects of the abuse Linnet suffered at the hands of her now dead husband and father in law, along with the constant plotting of Joscelin's treacherous half brother (the heir) and step mother. As always with Chadwick's books, the way she brings the medieval period to life in such a graceful and effortless way, be it the sights, sounds, smells, food, clothes and battles is just awesome. I see that it's been revised by the author and republished in the UK and Canada and finally listed at Amazon US."}, {"userName": "Iset", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4973578-iset", "userReview": "[after Joscelin and Linnet married, but before the exciting events of the climax which once again turn everything upside down, they face a couple of obstacles that kind of felt a little bit like a predictable up-and-down obstacle-and-resolution formula, but only because I really sensed that nothing was going to tear the couple apart once married and so from that place of security the obstacles they faced in that section of the book felt a little bit arbitrary or not quite as tense or thrilling.

If this book was written as a historical romance than it was ok, I've read so much better, if it was written as a historical then it lacked any historical content. I was familiar with the setting and the time period because of all the Plantagenet novels I've read but that was not really a big feature in the story. I have to be honest and say that I was really disappointed in this book. The first hook was around page 50 and it was a romantic hook and that was the only thing that kept the story interesting. I am glad it wasn't a long book but I really wanted to love Elizabeth Chadwick. Everyone has recommended 'The Greatest Knight' so I will try reading that down the track and hopefully that will be better."}, {"userName": "Nisareen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3694607-nisareen", "userReview": "Shields of Pride is set amidst the ill-fated rebellion of the young king Henry against his father, Henry II. The story focuses on Joscelin de Gael, illegitimate and oldest son of William de Rocher. After the death of his mother when Joscelin is only four years old, he's sent to live with his father and step family who deeply resent his presence. He runs away at fifteen to join his Uncle Conan and fight as a mercenary. He returns seven years later to his father's delight, but the relationship between him and his half brothers and step mother remains strained.Returning from a mission Joscelin comes across a broken cart and the ungrateful Giles de Montsorrel. While offering his assistance Joscelin meets Linnet and her son Robert and takes pity on their predicament. When Giles later falls from a horse and dies, Joscelin is asked to escort Linnet and her son Robert home, and soon finds himself nominated as Roberts warden and offered Linnet's hand in marriage. Linnet has spent the past six years of her life in an abusive marriage and is hiding a dark secret of her own but gradually she comes to trust and love Joscelin. Joscelin has had his own heartache in the past, having lost a young son to the bloody flux as well as his beloved mother Morwenna. His father William has never gotten over the death of Morwenna either and as a result his wife Agnes and sons have harboured ill intentions towards both William and Joscellin. When Ralf finally makes his move to get rid of William and Joscellin once and for all, Linnet must use all her wits to save them all.I almost didn't read this book as I was put off by the abuse suffered by Linnet at the hands of Giles at the beginning of the book as well as the other unpleasant characters i.e Ralf and Agnes. I'm so glad I persevered however as once the marriage between Joscellin and Linnet took place the book really took off. The last half of the book was particularly hard to put down as the book reached it's climax.The books biggest strength lies in the flawed, complex characters. My favourites were Joscellin, William and Conan. William's relationship with Linnet was especially interesting to read and poignant at times as she saw underneath the gruff exterior. The added bonus was the presence of the ghost of Morwenna which I though was a stroke of genius. Even Morwenna's gown at the end played a crucial role during the scuffle with Ralf and seemed like Morwenna was reaching out from beyond the grave! A must read."}, {"userName": "Julie Reynolds", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36334133-julie-reynolds", "userReview": "Extremely well written historical fiction.

His father\u2019s wife and half-brothers never forgave him the circunstances of his birth and he finally leaves home for several years.While returning to his father\u2019s house, he meets the unpleasant and jealous Gilles Montsorrel and his wife Linnet. After the accidental death of Gilles, Joscelin is chosen to protect his wife and son. But even if Linnet and Gilles start slowly trusting each other and eventually marry, some hidden secrets could change their relationship forever\u2026I have to confess that my favorite character is Joscelin. He is truly a wonderful, honest and strong man. There\u2019s some shades of gray here and there which makes him even more charismatic and the way he treats Linnet and her son is truly heartwarming.Linnet is more difficult to like but her flaws only make her more human. A battered wife, used and abused at her husband\u2019s hands, she doesn\u2019t trust men. Her secret creates some difficult moments with Joscelin but it\u2019s impossible to blame her for her past actions. I couldn\u2019t help feeling frustrated by her situation as a rich widow and mother of an heir. Just free from a monster and immediately forced to marry, unable to choose her husband or even take any decision for her future.Shields of Pride is one of the earliest works of Elizabeth Chadwick and even if not her best, it\u2019s still a magnificent weaved story. I\u2019ve read some of the author\u2019s other books like Shadows and Strongholds, The Love Knot or The Champion and every one of them is a delight, even the Hunt trilogy (it\u2019s what I call The Wild Hunt, The Running Vixen and The Leopard Unleashed) which is slightly different from her more recent works (they tend more towards the historical romance). For those who are really into this historical period, do not miss Elizabeth Chadwick\u2019s books!"}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52608370-rebecca", "userReview": "This is one of Chadwick's earlier novels and it does show. She notes that she was able to revise it for this new edition, but it is not as complex or as vivid as her more recent work. Interestingly though, it is set in an era which she has since explored in more detail in other novels - and you can spot names of characters whose stories will be explored. It's as if the seeds of those ideas and that interest were being sown in this 1994 book (although it is possible she may have added them later during the revisions).The story itself is a fairly straightforward romance, a little predictable if I'm honest, but it is nice to have a medieval novel that is focused just as much on the women, where other authors would neglect them. It is something I'm noticing (and enjoying) more in historical fiction, that there are increasing numbers of female authors, such as Elizabeth Chadwick, telling the stories of historical women. Some are fictional women, but many were real and a few, like Eleanor of Aquitane - featured in three of Chadwick's most recent books, are well-known. It certainly starts to balance things out in a genre that has previously seemed focused on the stories of men."}, {"userName": "Iain Reid", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/79509675-iain-reid", "userReview": "Sure it's a light romance: gazes are cast, swords are wielded, and bodices are ripped, but looking past that, EC still has a plenty to say about family.

Honestly, at least four house moves. It was always one that I saved for a rainy day, but on rainy days I always found something more exciting to read instead. However, I have been in somewhat of a book-slump and I wanted to try anything and everything to break it.I had never read an Elizabeth Chadwick novel before but recognised her as having a large back catalogue of novels which is a positive. Medieval isn't often my favourite setting for historical novels because I find that they can sacrifice plot and development for blood and gore. Medieval authors also seem to challenge themselves to how many times they can use the word 'wench' in any one story. This novel was no different really, though I will say that it was very well written and the characters were enjoyable.Do you feel my  however  coming? However,  I felt that I was reading a novel. I didn't ever feel 'swept away' with the novel, I liked the characters but I didn't really get  emotional  or  involved  with them. I thought the plot ticked along but I was never at the edge of my chair or gasping with worry, frustration or with love. I would recommend it as a well-written historical novel, and I would certainly read another Elizabeth Chadwick novel, but at the same time I wouldn't describe it as entertaining or absorbing."}, {"userName": "Jacey", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8133175-jacey", "userReview": "Another impeccable historical novel from the back-catalogue Elizabeth Chadwick with a strong romance plot combined with a hefty dollop of family feuding, relationships-gone-wrong, jealousy, ambition and revenge. This time her characters are fictitious and she has invented a couple of castles but placed them firmly in the area of South Nottinghamshire and set them amidst real events \u2013 the ill-fated rebellion of the young king Henry against his father, Henry II.Bastard mercenary Joscelin de Gayle, favourite son of William de Rocher, the baron they call Ironheart, is given the opportunity to marry the young widow Linnet de Montsorrel and take over the running of Rushcliffe. Linnet is a survivor with a guilty secret. She's given no choice in marrying Joscelin and they are betrothed even before her husband is buried. Rushcliffe has been badly maintained by Linnet's cruel first husband and Joscelin has to set the keep straight, get rid of the rotten retainers who have been robbing it blind and turn the men at arms into a decent fighting force at the same time as wooing Linnet.When Joscelin is elevated to the status of Baron and given Linnet and Rushcliffe all in one giant leap, he falls foul of his half-brothers. This is a rich and complicated study of family jealousy set against a detailed and accurate background of 12th century England."}, {"userName": "Bryn", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/784920-bryn", "userReview": "Joceline is the illegitimate son of a noble, Linnet is married to a rather nasty nobleman, and a chance meeting on the road makes it obvious that far too much stands between these two, and no way could they end u together. But times are uncertain, the King's sons are rebelling, loyalty is rare... and the chaos brings possibility.This is a fast paced, action laden tale full of intrigue, gripping fight sequences, heart breaking romances, and old ghosts. Some of the ghosts are more literal than others.Its enough the historical romance to please girly readers of such (forigve the sterotyping) but its also enough of an action adventure story that blokes who go for that sort of thing might well enjoy it too. If it was a film, it would be the perfect date-movie.Elizabeth Chadwick has a lovely story telling style, her heroes and heroines are flawed enough to be human, and deeply sympathetic. Her bad guys make sense as people, have motives you can believe, and are so icky you can't help but hope they get some serious poetic justice!It's an excellent read and I heartily enjoyed it."}, {"userName": "Favirah", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28580739-favirah", "userReview": "While the book focuses on the abuse Linnet faced from her husband I cannot forget the abuse Jocelyn's stepmother (Agnes) endured from his father. Jocelyn is a good warrior. He is a bastard son but is loved by his father. And the villains in this family are supposed to be his half brothers and the stepmother. The problem I have with this book is that I cannot forget the fact that his father is responsible for all the animosity between Jocelyn and Agnes and his half brothers.While Jocelyn father loved his mistress ( Jocelyn's mother) he treated his wife cruelly. Imagine comming home from his long absence and bring a pregnant mistress home. And continues to mistreat and shames the wife even after the mistress died. What wife would not feel hatred.

It\u2019s like a trick. This book started off better than average for historical romance, I\u2019d say. I like that the hero and heroine were a little different than the norm \u2013 he\u2019s a bastard son (Josceline de Gael), she\u2019s a battered wife with a young son (Linnet de Montsorrel). Linnet\u2019s husband dies, she\u2019s a rich widow and Josceline\u2019s family decides he should marry her. Chadwick seems to have done her historical research and I thought she handled the \u201cforced to marry a stranger\u201d bit pretty well. But this leaned more to the romance side of historical romance than I wanted and once Joscelin and Linnet married and then it turned into this weird convoluted kidnap/conspiracy part I tuned out.
