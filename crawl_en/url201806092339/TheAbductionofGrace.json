Not recommended."}, {"userName": "Barb", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/972090-barb", "userReview": "My rating: 3.5 starsThis book started out at a thrilling pace with the abduction of 5-year Grace. After about 25% into the book, the pace of the story slowed down and meandered a bit in the middle. It picked up again at the end with the revealing of Grace's abductor and the backstory. Overall a good read, but I was disappointed in the uneven pace of the story."}, {"userName": "Suzanne Steele", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19686828-suzanne-steele", "userReview": "This was simply superb.
