It\u2019s up to the investigators in the Coroner's office to determine what category they each fall into.Deputy Sheriff Clay Edison of the Coroner's office is called to a home in the Berkeley area to investigate a seemingly accidental death. A body at the bottom of the stair case. Simple enough - people trip and fall down the stairs all the time, right? Well, the dead mans\u2019 daughter Tatiana is on the scene and is positive he was murdered. She\u2019s doing her best to convince the investigators to see it her way. Against his better judgement, Clay begrudgingly probes deeper than he feels is necessary, only to find that there may in fact be more to this death than just an accidental fall.I've been a huge fan of Jonathan and Faye Kellerman for years reading their separate series and combined efforts. I haven\u2019t read anything from their son Jesse, though I\u2019ve been meaning to. I\u2019m not sure of the contribution of each author to this book but I can definitely feel the flavor of Jonathan Kellerman. His main characters, Alex Delaware and long-time girlfriend Robin make a cameo appearance in this book too! Bonus!The main character Clay is strong and very likeable. We are given a good deal of insight into his background and character, flaws and all! This book reads very easily and quickly. I enjoyed every page, beginning to end. My only issue was there were so many characters, at times I had difficulty keeping them straight.The foundations seem set for this to be a new and potentially long successful series. Fingers crossed! I am definitely a fan of this new series and will be watching and waiting for the next installment. Highly recommend!Thank you to NetGalley, Random House Publishing Group \u2013 Ballantine, Jonathan and Jesse Kellerman"}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5903843-matt", "userReview": "In another joint effort, Jonathan and Jesse Kellerman seek to hit the reset button after a miserable writing venture about monsters and other such inane topics. After taking a breather, this piece allows their true colours to shine through, crafting a superior series debut novel. Clay Edison has quite the life as a deputy sheriff with the county coroner\u2019s office. Edison attends crime scenes to help move along the manner of death and working to notify families of loss, when appropriate. While the job has its macabre side, Edison can find small crumbs of interest, especially when a case takes on an unexpected twist. Attending the scene of an apparent fall, Edison encounters a distraught Tatiana Rennert-Delavigne, daughter of the victim, one Walter Rennert. Edison must calm Tatiana, who is sure that her father\u2019s death was anything but accidental, citing an old murder from 1993 that bore similarities. Unable to provide any concrete answers at the scene, Edison assures the distraught woman that he will be in touch, his brain curious about the aforementioned murder from the nineties. The autopsy seems to back up the suspected accidental death from a fall, showing heart issues, but that only piques Edison\u2019s curiosity even more. Medication prescribed to Rennert seems to have come from an unlikely source and Edison runs a little longer with this 1993 murder to see if there are truly parallels. There appears to be something, as Rennert was a psychology professor running an interesting study in years past, seeking to find a parallel between violent video games and the behaviour that came from it. When one of the test subjects, Julian Triplett, was charged and convicted with the murder of Rennert\u2019s student assistance on the study, the academic exploration\u2019s relevance seems to heighten. Now, all these years later, Edison must try to determine if Triplett could have something to do with Rennert\u2019s death, while not being completely convinced that there was foul play at all. With a handful of cases cluttering up his desk and the desire not to get too involved with Tatiana, Clay Edison must remember the limits to his job and let those in a position of authority crack the case, if there is one at all. The Kellermans prove that they can work together to create a wonderful story and thriller, given the proper tools. I had written them off as a team, but must now rethink my critique, as long as they stick to series like this. Surely, crime thriller lovers will want to test the waters with this piece, which has all the ingredients for a successful novel.I will admit to being a long-time Jesse Kellerman fan and have heard much about his father. Excitement spilt over when I heard they penned a novel together, but that turned to disappointment when I read the poorly crafted piece that significant undershorts the NYT Bestselling Author moniker both have procured. Slowly, I thawed to the idea of returning to one of their novels, seeing others praise this collaboration, and am now glad that I gave them the chance. Clay Edison proves to be an interesting character, packed full with a backstory that will lure the reader in a little further. A college basketball star who remained local, allowing is past glory envelop him for those who remember his court antics. Now, working in that job that straddles the coroner with police authority, Edison\u2019s work pushes him to the limits and allows him a little chance to sleuth around, without the gun or cuffs. Pairing him with a few strong secondary characters, the Kellermans allow Edison\u2019s various character flaws to come through, as well as the strength of his determination. The attentive reader will even see one of Jonathan Kellerman\u2019s protagonists play a cameo role in part of the story, which seems to enrich at least that portion of the tale. The story itself is intriguing, though one cannot call it entirely unique. A killer potentially on the loose and seeking some form of retribution for his crime. It does have aspects of a beaten, dead horse, but it is the way the Kellermans present it that keeps the reader wanting to know more. I am curious, I will admit that, though I am still not sure how deep this series can go. I would like to see more before diving head-long into complete praise, but have seen a great deal of potential here.Kudos, Messrs. Kellerman, as you embark on what I can only hope is a more successful and less asinine journey than Golem work. I am intrigued and hope the literary vapours that seep from your family will create more successful novels soon. Like/hate the review?

Kellerman has a way with prose that is so easy, flowing and gentle that you simply go merrily along from beginning to end. Which, unfortunately, was my problem. I like a bit of a challenge in my reading, whether it's a classic, a comedy or a cozy mystery. Excite me, teach me, tell me something I don't know. Sadly, Kellerman's books are so formulaic that they all just blend together. Crime Scene is written in tandem with his son, Jesse. However, based on the type of writing in this book, I suspect it was written more by the latter than the former. There are passages that don't flow well, references that don't lead anywhere and I honestly thought I had entered a series in the middle because it felt as though I should have known things about the characters that I did not and which were not explained until near the ending of the book. They weren't crucial to the plot, just out of place facts that should have been dealt with up front. The plot itself wasn't bad but, again, it all had been done before and was very predictable from the start. Despite all of that, if you like Kellerman, you will probably like this book. Meh. It's passable but nothing exciting. If I had not been stuck on a plane I would not have finished it."}, {"userName": "Jill Croce-McGill", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9119740-jill-croce-mcgill", "userReview": "This book does not disappoint! A solid thriller!Crime Scene by father and son duo, Jonathan and Jesse Kellerman, is the first book in a new exciting series that features Clay Edison, a Deputy Sheriff with the Coroner's Office, and former basketball star. Clay will easily become a fan favorite with his winning personality and strong character. Clay Edison finds himself drawn into a complicated investigation, the death of Walter Rennert, a retired psychology professor. His death brings on multiple new questions about an old crime where one of his students was brutally murdered. Tatiana, Walter's daughter, insists he was murdered - pushed down the stairs. Clay believes he died of natural causes - Walter had a history of drinking and heart problems. The more Clay digs deeper into Walter's investigation, the more it seems to have to do with an old case. Will Clay discover the truth? Will he lose his job for digging deeper into the past? Extremely well-written with a well thought out plot and well-developed characters...

Arriving at the scene the victim's daughter, Tatiana, has insisted that her father was pushed down his stairway and that it couldn't possibly have been an accident. Tatiana insists her father has been living in fear of a man from his past for years that had already killed someone else. After digging into the scene and the evidence including an autopsy of the victim Clay is pretty certain that the death was not a homicide. Something about Tatiana's story though intrigues Clay to look further into her father and his past until he finds himself following clues from years before and unable to just close his current case. Crime Scene is the first book in the new series Clay Edison by Jonathon and Jesse Kellerman. Being new to anything by either Kellerman I was eager to give this book a try after hearing good things and wanting to check out their work. I'm happy to say that this was a nice little mystery/thriller following along the twists and turns to find out the truth to what happened. My only thing I wondered about while reading this story that had me a bit curious was Clay only seems to keep digging into the case due to his attraction to Tatiana, not sure if I find that completely believable as most would have a lot more work coming their way. I also found this a tad slow in parts to me but still enjoyed the story quite a bit and will definitely look for more from the Kellermans.

I can tell from all of the awards he has won over the years.  Seriously now, wife Faye Kellerman is also an outstanding writer, so son Jesse has some serious writing chops in his background. Jonathan and Jesse have teamed up to write the first in a series featuring Clay Edison, a deputy assigned as a death investigator with the Coroner's bureau of Alameda County in California. Edison's job is strictly to help determine the manner of death whether it be homicide, suicide, accidental, natural causes or undetermined. He investigates the scene of the death looking for information that would aid in the determination. Is there a shoe untied on the body near a flight of stairs? Is there a knife sticking out of the body? It is not Edison's job to figure out the who or the why, just the how. But in the recent death of Dr Walter Rennart he is drawn into a deeper investigation by the doctor's beautiful daughter Tatiania who insists her father was murdered despite everything pointing to a natural death. It is an earlier murder of a young coed that Dr Rennart lost his reputation over that soon piques Edison's interest.There is a special delight in getting in on the ground of a new series, especially one that seem like it will go places. Clay Edison is a thoughtful character who has much room to grow in the following books.I've always read Jonathan Kellerman. He writes a hell of a story. Problem is, I'm not overly fond of elitist Dr. Delaware. So I am hoping I continue to like Clay Edison as much as I do in this book.I'm not sure if this makes much sense but I really liked the plot, it was very well -written, however the whodunnit was way too easy to figure out. I didn't feel challenged at all.I mentally took half star off for using the word spectating. Why did spectate/spectating as a verb suddenly start showing up? What's wrong with watch? Maybe Edison was just using it ironically.This is a great start to a new series. Oh heck, I just realized the drawback of a new series, waiting another year for the next installment.Thank you to NetGalley for this ARC in exchange for a fair and honest review."}, {"userName": "Monnie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6277675-monnie", "userReview": "If the name Kellerman is on it, it's a pretty sure bet I'll like it. Over many years, I've devoured just about every book by Jonathan, his wife Faye, and their son Jesse. I've also learned, though, that collaborations don't always live up to their hype, and sometimes the first book in a series falls flat. But neither am I one to look a gift horse in the mouth: Pass up an opportunity to read an advance copy of anything written by favorite authors in exchange for an honest review? Just ain't gonna happen.And honestly? I enjoyed it thoroughly. Perhaps most importantly, I really love the new character, Clay Edison, a deputy in the Coroner's Bureau (a bit of a twist on the standard-issue police detective). He comes with a few flaws - his brother is in jail, a serious knee injury put the kibosh on a possible superstar career in basketball, and he's got a shaky relationship with his parents. There's also no main squeeze, thus paving the way for him to be at the mercy of any gorgeous female character he meets. On the other side, while his degree in psychology doesn't put him anywhere near the big leagues, it does give him a leg up when it comes to reading people, whether they be co-workers (like his hypochondriac partner Zaragoza), victims or perpetrators.As this one begins, reclusive former psychology professor Walter Rennert is found dead by his daughter Tatiana (cue in that gorgeous female character). It appears that daddy simply fell down the stairs, but Tatiana insists her father was murdered. She continues to believe that even after the evidence reveals that his history of drinking and a bad heart are to blame. Clay, of course, is intrigued with Tatiana and agrees to take a closer look, to the dismay of his superiors who want the case closed.As he digs deeper, he learns that Rennert resigned in disgrace when a coed was murdered by a mentally unstable participant in one of the professor's experiments. A few other clues throw more suspicion on the circumstances surrounding Rennert's death; and the deeper Clay digs, the more he wants to know about that experiment and precisely what went wrong. That, in turn, means Clay must call on one of Kellerman Senior's best-known characters, Dr. Alex Delaware, for help. The psychologist and LAPD consultant, it seems, had offered expert testimony at the trial of the young man who confessed to the coed's murder, who has since been released from jail. As an aside, Dr. Delaware has long been on my Top 10 list of favorite male characters, so I was happy to see him show up here. But I must say I thought he came across a bit snarky during his meeting with Clay, even allowing for the constraints of doctor-patient privilege. Then again, maybe it was just me; as I was reading that part, I realized I'd been so engrossed that I'd kept reading more than an hour past my usual dinnertime. In the end, as I said at the beginning, this is a very well written book with interesting, well-developed characters (especially Clay). Already, I'm looking forward to his next appearance."}, {"userName": "Poppy fairy ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18322003-poppy-fairy", "userReview": "I liked The Murder Book one of Jonathan Kellerman's earlier books, much better than this one.

The characters felt one sided and the crime solving was making such big leaps that even the other characters were telling Clay Edison that he needed more.It had a fairly consistent flow, it just felt so...flat.

Big thanks to Net Galley and Random House Ballantine for the DRC, which I received in exchange for this honest review. I rate this mystery 3.5 stars and round it upward. Edison is a coroner\u2019s investigator, and he finds himself drawn into an ugly, complicated murder, seduced by the lovely Tatiana, who I find myself disliking much earlier than the protagonist does. There\u2019s the psychological component here that\u2019s similar to the movies, where the audience yells, \u201cDon\u2019t go through that door\u201d as the main character strolls obliviously forward; however, where the Kellermans take the story once Edison has wised up is interesting, original, and well played. I enjoy the snappy banter that I associate with the elder Kellerman\u2019s other novels, and there\u2019s a hugely entertaining side character named Afton that I\u2019d love to see again. The setting of the down-and-out neighborhood is resonant enough that I am convinced at least one of these men has actually spent time in such a place.That said, the first half of the story is better paced than the second, and there\u2019s a racial component that appears well-intentioned but awkward.

Walter Rennert has apparently had a cardiac event and fallen down the stairs. His daughter, Tatiana, insists he was murdered and offers as evidence the fact that his former colleague and friend died in the same way. Although it is not his job Clay's attraction to Tatiana convinces him to take a look at the old case and what he discovers is a real can of worms.I thoroughly enjoyed Crime Scene. Messrs Kellerman are experienced writers so they know how to grab and hold the reader's attention and I was glued to the pages from start to finish. I like that the novel starts as one thing, an investigation into Walter Rennert's death, and morphs into a completely different investigation. Looking back on it logically it doesn't make total sense that Clay would pursue this secondary investigation so zealously on his own time but curiosity is not always sensible. During the course of my reading this thought did not cross my mind as I was so caught up in Clay's investigation and desperate to know what would be coming next.It is an interesting choice to make Clay a Coroner's Deputy rather than a detective. To me it seems that he gets the best of both worlds, the ability to freelance but with access to police files. A Coroner's Deputy is an officer but their remit is to examine the body to determine if it requires an autopsy, identify it and comfort relatives so no real investigative work is involved and Clay steps well beyond that. He is a nice guy, good at his job and motivated to do right by his bodies and their families. Don't, however, let the nice guy image fool you. He is a former top class college athlete who had to give it up through injury and he applies the same relentless drive that brought him basketball success to his investigation.

Although there is no indication of anything more, Clay feels an attraction to Tatiana, and slowly becomes interested in Rennert's backstory and the study of the effect of violent video games on adolescents that went so terribly wrong that left him guilt-ridden.Well-written and well-plotted--an excellent introduction to a new character and a new series.Sometimes the division of labor in a collaboration is obvious, but Crime Scene is pretty seamless. Initially, I thought maybe Jonathan Kellerman would write the part of Alex Delaware, his well-known character, and that Jesse Kellerman would write the part of Clay Edison. But no, Alex Delaware gets a mention (with some playful pokes), but does not take a role in this novel, and the writing is smooth and consistent--whole cloth, not patchwork.Although I've read Jonathan Kellerman's Alex Delaware series for years, this the first book I've read in which father and son collaborate, and I've never read anything by Jesse Kellerman. I need to rectify that situation.Read in June; A Garden Carried in the Pocket post scheduled for July 17NetGalley/Random House/BallentineCrime/Suspense. Aug. 1, 2017.

Clay Edison has worked in the Alameda County Coroner\u2019s for five years. Clay\u2019s days are filled with the ordinary and the very unordinary. \u201cCrime Scene\u201d is written as a first person narrative by Clay, and this strategy delivers an interesting and insightful look at Clay\u2019s feelings and at the events that surround him. He talks to the readers as he talks to himself. The dialogue and responses within the story reflect the characters as Clay interacts with them. Geography, problems, questions, feelings, and scenarios are as Clay sees them and makes judgments about them.People weave in and out of Clay\u2019s daily life. Clay\u2019s job haunts him; it lives with him. The work clings to him. He thinks about the dead everywhere he goes. He is not haunted, but he is never quite alone. Every time Clay is called to a location, he is about to ruin someone\u2019s day. Someone is dead, by natural causes or by homicide, but dead. With a click of a button he decides which it is. One case nags at him, presents an underlying question. The case is not even a \u201chomicide\u201d that he feels compelled to solve; it is just that his mind will not let this case go. While trying to resolve this accidental death of an elderly man, he discovers a tangled web of deceit, loyalty, buried secrets, and murders. Secrets from the past creep into the present, and old cases become entangled with recent events. Nothing is really as is appears at first. \u201cCrime Scene\u201d is an interesting new look at crime fiction. It is not a typical murder mystery. There is no graphic violence, no revolting accounts, just regular people doing a distinctly unpleasant job. I was \u201cconnected\u201d with Clay and his quest throughout the book. I have read other books by the Kellermans, and this is one of the best. I was given a copy of \u201cCrime Scene\u201d to review by Ballantine Books, NetGalley, Jonathan Kellerman and Jesse Kellerman, and I really enjoyed it. I highly recommend this to everyone."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900200-cheryl", "userReview": "\"They ask for why. I give them how.\"I have been a fan of Jonathan Kellerman since the beginning of his writing career. I have read all of his Alex Delaware series and enjoyed them.Now Jonathan Kellerman has teamed with his son, Jesse Kellerman, and CRIME SCENE is the first book in a brand new series (although Alex Delaware did make a cameo appearance) featuring protagonist Deputy Clay Edison. Edison is a coroner's investigator for Alameda County, California - a large county east of San Francisco that includes Berkeley and Oakland within its boundaries.I liked the character of Edison who gets involved in a convoluted case in this book that takes him to Berkeley and Reno, Nevada and back. He wants the right answers on his cases, not just the quick ones. I also liked his hypochondriac partner Zaragosa. I wish he'd played more of a role in the book.I tend to try to stay away from series books anymore because of the usually long time span between books but I liked this new character and the father - son writing style enough to want to read future books in this Clay Edison series.I received this book from Random House through the Amazon VINE program in exchange for my unbiased review."}, {"userName": "Ann", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3119697-ann", "userReview": "I usually enjoy Jonathan Kellerman's books, but this one, written together with his son, is blah. To start with, I couldn't figure out what exactly Clay Edison's role in law enforcement is. He seems to be a sheriff's deputy who works in the morgue. So he's not a detective and he's not a medical examiner and it seems that as soon as he starts asking questions, he's trespassing on other people's turf. Second, he had a short brilliant career as a basketball player in college, but was definitely sidelined by a knee injury. But he seems to have never gotten over those days (even though he publicly denies it) and I find that a rather cheap way of setting up an inner conflict in the protagonist. Third, too much of the story doesn't make sense. When Dr. Rennert is found dead at the bottom of his staircase, the dead man's daughter insists that it was murder, something to do with a lawsuit from a decade earlier, when a subject in psychological research conducted by Dr. Rennert and his graduate student, Nicholas Lindhurst, was convicted of murdering a young woman. Clay gamely starts following up this thread, even after an autopsy shows conclusively that Dr. Rennert died of a dissecting aortic aneurysm. He keeps following up even after the daughter, with whom he's gotten hot and heavy for a night or so, ditches him without warning. And even after she changes her mind and gets angry with him for doing just what she had insisted he do in the first place. Clay is strangely passive through it all. The chronology also doesn't make a lot of sense, especially with regards to the question of when Dr. Rennert acquired a gun. Clay also inexplicably fails to follow up op a clue that is practically flashing a red neon sign saying \"this is the link to the missing man\" - a prescription for an antipsychotic written by a urologist ! Alex Delaware makes a short cameo into the book, just enough to remind me why I love the Alex Delaware novels and didn't care for this one : those books abound with memorable descriptions of Los Angeles and secondary characters that sound like people you'd want to meet (if only to marvel at how awful they are). And Milo Sturgis, Alex Delaware's detective friend, can always be counted on to deliver some cynical one-liners. I always feel compelled to keep on reading those books, whereas this one was more of a dutiful slog, hoping for a brilliant ending - that never happened."}, {"userName": "Gloria Feit", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6469333-gloria-feit", "userReview": "This novel, a joint effort by the Kellermans, pere et fils, is said to be the first of a new series featuring Clay Edison, a deputy sheriff in the coroner\u2019s office, as the protagonist. It is a sort of crime story mixed in with a lot of psychology. Edison seems to be a compulsive sort of guy who can\u2019t let go.The job of a deputy sheriff is to rule on whether a death is natural or has some other cause. When he went to pick up the body of Walter Rennert, it appeared to be an open-and-shut case, and the autopsy proved he died of a heart attack. But Rennert\u2019s daughter tells Edison her father was murdered, contrary to the evidence. So, instead of closing the case, he keeps it open and undertakes an investigation way beyond his duties, leading him far away from approved procedures, even looking into previous apparently unrelated deaths. Meanwhile, he becomes more and more involved with the daughter.This is a hard novel to follow and, for a Kellerman effort, relatively slow reading. Even a cameo appearance by Dr. Alex Delaware does nothing much to help. Let\u2019s hope any follow-up overcomes this concern. Nevertheless, it is an interesting plot, and the novel is recommended."}, {"userName": "Catherine", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2284640-catherine", "userReview": "This book is so good. I really hope this is the start of a new series because I want more!The main character in this book is named Clay Edison and he's a deputy coroner in California. Luckily he's a super curious deputy coroner, because this book reads much more like a detective story than a boring and gross one about a morgue. I am a fan of both of these authors. I've read every Alex Delaware book (all 32 of them ... it seems crazy to me that there have been that many!!) and almost every Jesse Kellerman book (I haven't tackled the second Jacob Lev book yet).
