It's the closest thing to time-traveling. The author takes us to a time when practically all America south of the US border was one varied but politically unified entity. The 300 hundred years passed since colonization had barely made any difference in the way peoples and races lived on the continent. No progress either economically or socially. So the most interesting thing of this book, in my opinion, lies on this ability to make a still picture of 300 hundred years of life in South America.Afraid that the book would be too technical, too botanical, I had left it aside for too long, regrettably. This is humanity at work, civilization-making (or rather staling), this is a picture of humanity surrounded by humbling nature. Man strives to improve his condition against that of his neighbor, fights to better his social condition against those who are not his kind, his race, his relatives. But man is humbled over and over again by nature.It is thought-provoking, if not downright funny, to see supposedly civilized Spaniards trying to civilize their Indian \u201cpupils\u201d. Retrospectively both failed, as always happens when the one-eyed lead the blind. Fat chance of finding any literate Spaniards among the \u201ccivilized\u201d conquerors and colonists. The Catholic church endeavored to keep the monopoly of literacy for so long, in Spain as well as in America.Humboldt's clarity of mind and sensibleness are made apparent, to mention one example, when he takes on the praise lavished on the Guanches of the Canary Islands, who became a fashionable topic among Spaniards, only \u201cwhen Spain was at the zenith of her glory\u201d. More so: \u201cWhen nations are mentally exhausted and see the seeds of depravity in their refinements, the idea that in some distant region infant societies enjoy pure and perpetual happiness pleases them.\u201d Utopias and hypocrisy were things Humboldt didn't fall for as socialists-turned-environmentalists today do: \u201cenormous forest fires are also caused by the carelessness of the Indians who forget to put out their camp fires.\u201dBeing myself a Spaniard by birth I have to deplore how little, if at all, has the Spanish idiosyncrasy changed since immemorial times, and am amazed how well this author detects faults in our national soul: \u201ca shoemaker of Castilian descent \u2026 received us with gravity and self-sufficiency characteristic in those countries where the people feel they possess some special talent.\u201d One might think the author a little arrogant himself, but this is not so. Humboldt is equanimity personified. The shoemaker \u201cpulled a few small opaque pearls from out of his leather pouch and forced us to accept them, making us note down \u2026 that white and noble Castilian race had given us something that, across the ocean, was thought of as very precious.\u201dMore on Spanish traits: \u201cThe missionary in San Fernando was an Aragonese Capuchin \u2026 sitting in his redwood armchair most of the day without doing anything, he complained of what he called the laziness and ignorance of his countrymen \u2026 however seemed quite satisfied with his situation.\u201d It is also very symptomatic of Spaniards from all regions to see their \u201clively curiosity manifested \u2026 in the middle of American jungles for the wars and political storms in the Old World.\u201dSpanish old prejudice against manual labor (when done by themselves, that is), as was described in 16th century Spanish literature, picaresque mostly (e.g. Lazarillo de Tormes), lives on and well: \u201cMany of the whites of European stock, especially the poorest \u2026 leave their townhouses \u2026 dare to work with their own hands, which, given the rigid prejudices in this country, would be a disgrace in the city.\u201dHumboldt does recognize the divide between the English-speaking world and the Hispanic world, as reflected in their American versions, and as early as the 1800's: \u201cBeyond the Atlantic ocean, only the United States of America offers asylum to those in need. A government that is strong because of freedom, and confident because it is just, has nothing to fear in granting refuge to exiles.\u201dA book to relish because it blends beautifully Hispanic cupidity and arrogance with nature's zero tolerance for stupidity and tough reality. The Spanish-speaking world continues to reap what it sows."}, {"userName": "Lynn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/767317-lynn", "userReview": "I'd like to give this book 3-1/2 stars. I've read better travel accounts. But Humboldt was writing in the early 1800s. His native tongue was German, but he wrote in French, and this is a translation into English. It would have been helpful to have a better, more detailed map of the interior route. It was hard to follow where Humboldt was and where he was going. But parts of the book that describe the native people and culture were fascinating."}, {"userName": "Valerie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3394050-valerie", "userReview": "Humboldt's work doesn't contain all that much specific documentation of his scientific observations, as many natural historians before him did. It does, however, present as an intriguing Romantic work with many poetic descriptions of nature and the people who lived in the areas he visited. This book is the more interesting parts of the notes he took on his travels (or well, more interesting to the general public)."}, {"userName": "Gilly McGillicuddy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/733051-gilly-mcgillicuddy", "userReview": "Alexander Von Humboldt's \"Personal Narrative of A Title With Way Too Many Words\". Feeling a bit cheated that it's only selections of his actual Narrative, but let's look past that for the moment. I'd expected something much along the lines of Darwin, but oh, how much more I am loving this. Not to disparage Darwin or anything, but HUMBOLDT <3!

I picked this up thinking that it was going to be another boring scientific read, and I was pleasantly surprised. Although it may be a rather dry read, I must say that Von Humboldt's enthusiasm for everything he saw on his travels is truly felt in this book. He loves and is deeply interested in EVERYTHING - from rocks, plants, fruit, animals. 3* for the man who could do everything from geology to botany to astronomy, including paint - the cover is a self-portrait, if you don't mind."}, {"userName": "Jordan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8439528-jordan", "userReview": "My opinion is probably not the best judge of this book. I have very little interest in natural history, so this book (which I read for a class) was not entertaining to me. It is interesting to analyze what must have been going through Humboldt's mind on his monumental journey, but it's a niche piece, one that didn't resonate with me as much as someone who has an interest in this sort of thing."}, {"userName": "Humphrey", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2363940-humphrey", "userReview": "If travel writing and natural history are your thing, Humboldt's Personal Narrative is a brisk and entertaining volume.

By the time of his death in 1859, he had won international fame for his scientific discoveries, his observations of Native American peoples and his detailed descriptions of the flora and fauna of the 'new continent'. The first to draw and speculate on Aztec art, to observe reverse polarity in magnetism and to discover why America is called America, his writings profoundly influenced the course of Victorian culture, causing Darwin to reflect: 'He alone gives any notion of the feelings which are raised in the mind on first entering the Tropics'.", "title": "Personal Narrative of a Journey to the Equinoctial Regions of the New Continent", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/641481.Personal_Narrative_of_a_Journey_to_the_Equinoctial_Regions_of_the_New_Continent", "average": 3.88, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1361559166l/641481.jpg", "reviews": 11, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/303739.Alexander_von_Humboldt", "name": "Alexander von Humboldt"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/615888.Malcolm_Nicolson", "name": "Malcolm Nicolson"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2745793.Jason_Wilson", "name": "Jason  Wilson"}], "type": ["Travel", "Nonfiction", "Science", "History", "Environment"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/641481.Personal_Narrative_of_a_Journey_to_the_Equinoctial_Regions_of_the_New_Continent", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2252543.Jaguars_and_Electric_Eels", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18619387-cosmos", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18526635-views-of-nature", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19343505-personal-narrative-of-travels-to-the-equinoctial-regions-of-america-dur", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7326690-essay-on-the-geography-of-plants"]}
