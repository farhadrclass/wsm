Catherine Carey is a relatively minor character in Tudor era drama though she is closely related to larger players, just how closely is a subject for debate. The story is a intimately told personal story of love, family, and loyalty that focuses on Catherine and her children rather than the historical events of the day. Since she was born during the reign of Henry VIII, survived Edward VI and Mary I, and served Elizabeth I, Catherine has an interesting story to tell.That being said, she is above all else a wife and mother. Catherine avoids most of the drama of the Tudor court, the major exception to this rule being when she and her husband find refuge with Protestants on the Continent during the reign of Queen Mary. This gives an interesting glimpse into the decisions that each family had to make during the religious unrest of the 16th century.Catherine is submissive to her husband and loyal to Queen Elizabeth (no matter how horridly the virgin queen behaves), which causes her story to largely be the story of others and events that are beyond he control. Sometimes, this causes more telling than showing, but the reader is at the mercy of Catherine's limited point-of-view. The most emotive moments are when she births, cares for, and inevitably loses several of her fourteen children. While she yearns to simply raise her children, the demanding Queen Elizabeth frequently keeps Catherine away from her beloved family so that she can fulfill important duties such as caring for the royal pet monkey. Suffice it to say that Catherine had far more patience for the situations she was placed in than I would!We are given glimpses of Catherine's daughter Lettice, who promises to have a more dramatic story. I wonder if the author will be carrying on with her.I was pleased to find this book available through Kindle Unlimited."}, {"userName": "Caidyn (BW Book Reviews; he/him/his)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13614926-caidyn-bw-book-reviews-he-him-his", "userReview": "DNF at 14%Someone I'm friends with on here, mainly because she only reads Tudor history and I think she's great for recommendations of that stuff, rated this book five stars. So, I got hella excited. I read the author's contribution to the In a Nutshell series, which was all about Catherine Carey's life. Thought it was interesting and good, so I decided I'd give this a go. Sometimes it's easier jumping into fiction before nonfiction.Now I'm sitting here wondering if we read the same book. Or, in my case, threw up my hands and gave up trying it.I mean, I have no problem with some historical things veering off course. Like, Jane Boleyn being pregnant and losing a baby. There's no historical basis against it, and there's really none for it. So, I could care less. Same with saying Catherine Carey is Henry VIII's illegitimate child. Again, no problem with that since it really seems most of the historical facts show it's completely possible she was, and that she wasn't acknowledged because she was, well, a girl.For me, that wasn't a huge problem.What was a problem with how much it reminded me of The Other Boleyn Girl. Funnily enough, that's the one I hated when I read it. Absolutely despised it. Gregory went so off base with facts that it just got me upset. Then, she grossly misrepresented Anne Boleyn as a complete and utter bitch, while not even bothering to show her other side. Anne was a bitch. Can't deny that. An ambitious bitch, but that was not all of her. Then, my other issue with TOBG was the narrator, Mary Boleyn. So fucking annoying that I wanted to claw my eyes out with my short, stubby nails.I could feel the rage building for me in this book, no matter how historically accurate it was.Instead of how Gregory showed Anne in a completely evil light to fit with Mary juxtaposing her, Dillard made Jane Boleyn so nice and loving. Jane Boleyn: The True Story of the Infamous Lady Rochford showed me that Jane wasn't evil, that there is an astounding lack of evidence for popular history about her. However, it also doesn't show her as a completely good person. Dillard set out to make her sympathetic in all the wrong ways, completely forgetting that she was a woman at court. Sorry, but she wouldn't have survived that long without being a bit of a conniving bitch. It's true.Then, like mother like daughter. Catherine Carey in this was turning out to be completely like Mary Boleyn in TOBG. I don't want to go to court! Boo-hoo! Oh no, the king's really my dad?!?!?!!!1 But he's so evil!!!!1!! Or is he evil?? I am so confused! But, I love this stable guy and I want to marry him. (Then she goes wandering around at night and finds him. And he was wandering around thinking about how much he loves her. Convenient, right?) HE LOVES ME TOOOO!!111! Wait, we can't marry because my evil but not evil dad found me a good husband who is insanely in love with me???? NOOOOO!11111 I can't do it!That was where I cut it short. I was 15 once upon a time. And, if I ever thought like that, I would have shot myself in the face. Maybe it's because I'm not a woman, but most of my friends were girls in high school and I highly doubt they thought like that.Don't even get me started on the writing. So simplistic. There was no depth and the author really didn't know about showing vs. telling. Maybe I'm being harsh on the author and book. All I know is I had an issue with the writing from the first chapter, then it developed into an issue with the characters that then spiraled into problems with the plot and MC. By that point, it wasn't worth reading. Imagine my rant if I had tried reading past the first part of the book."}, {"userName": "Gretchen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8469197-gretchen", "userReview": "I can't remember the last time I read a book worthy of devouring in a day.

The love between Catherine and Francis Knollys is one of true love. I found the story to be written historically correct concerning the main characters. Elizabeth I has always been an enigmatic and powerful queen; most books focucing on her decision-making as a queen. However, the author shows a more intimate side of the queen in her youth. This book does focus on all the Tudor kings/queens from Henry VIII to Elizabeth I during Catherine's lifetime and the role she must play between court lady and manor lady/wife/mother and her personal struggle to adjust. How she could have 13 children and not be with them every day of their life: but that was the life of a courtier.

This author and historian has a very good premise and follows that forward in a very engrossing and extremely readable fashion. Perhaps a bit more depth to their characters could have worked but Catherine and Francis were courtiers, after all, and kept their emotions in check.I read it straight through and will look forward to the next offering by Adrienne Dillard.

Adrienne Dillard is the author but she has, more importantly, become my friend. It will probably not surprise anyone that we 'met' on a post from Dan Jones' Facebook page. We share a love of history, specifically the Tudor era, and really ridiculous amounts of awesome GIFs. As such, while this book was a gift, it did not come with the expectation of a review. It came as a gift from one friend to another.Normally, I do not like historical fiction. Everyone and their mother knows this by now. There are exceptions I am willing to make though - particularly if it is someone who I know about, but not too much. I can not abide fictional works of certain real-life people, namely Eleanor of Aquitaine and her brood. She is too near and dear to my heart for me to entertain what someone thinks she MIGHT HAVE said or thought. Novels like this then are ideal for me because I know who Catherine Carey was, but have no deep connection otherwise. I enjoy Adrienne's work because she is thorough in her research and always quick to make note of where she took her information from, what is historically accurate, and what came from her own imagination. That is the reason I read her second novel, of Jane Boleyn, so quickly. I could not put it down. I enjoyed learning Catherine's story, but was also pleased to find that I for the most part was able to decipher on my own what was real and what was imagined, based on my other Tudor knowledge.One thing I am not a fan of is stories told in first person. That is really the only aspect of the novel that bothered me, and it bothers me in literally every other novel I have read in the last five years. I don't know what has caused this change in me, it never used to bother me so much. Perhaps it is because my brain is now wired for non-fiction, so peoples' thoughts and emotion perturbed me now. Who knows.I did enjoy some of the perspectives taken in Catherine's eyes, particularly that of Mary I. I have long maintained a special place in my heart for the daughter of Catherine of Aragon. I feel the treatment of herself and her mother by Henry in the years leading up to and following his marriage to Anne Boleyn were what changed Mary into the person she became. By all accounts she was a happy, thriving child, but Henry took that light in her and twisted it and damaged it beyond repair. Had she been treated more justly, I believe her reign would have reflected that. I also appreciated Catherine's portrayal in how she regarded Elizabeth - that she was difficult. Elizabeth is one of my least favorite people in history, I find her manipulative and dramatic and annoying. I am glad to see I am not the only one who might view her as difficult and Catherine and I agreed greatly - though she was still loyal and loved Elizabeth dearly.The tenderness between the various characters is what really stands out in this novel for me, whether it be between husbands and wives, parents and children, etc. Sometimes it is easy to look back on these long-ago times and see these people as so wholly different from us. But it is also easy to forget they will in fact real people with real thoughts and feelings and hopes and dreams, people who loved those dear to them. I always find this especially true when addressing the high mortality rate in infants and children of the time. Just because a family has so many children does not mean the deaths of little ones are felt any less deeply. I also appreciated the love between Catherine and her husband. While it was an arranged marriage, I can hope that it truly became a loving one - and I think the multitude of children reflects that.The big question here though, involves the view that recognizes Catherine has Henry VIII's daughter, this making Catherine a half sister to three Tudor monarchs. I believe until there is DNA testing done to prove once and for all, this debate will not end. But, as we can not even pin down the time line correctly, this may be another one for the 'We will never know' pile. Overall this was a lovely portrayal of a lesser-known figure in Tudor history. If you enjoy historical fiction based on the facts available, you will likely enjoy this one. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Sarah Bryson", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65731786-sarah-bryson", "userReview": "Cor Rotto: A Novel of Catherine Carey is one of the most realistic, emotive fictional novels that I have ever read. I have read a number of fictional historical books over the years and from the moment that I picked up this book I was absolutely hooked. Initially I became interested in this book as I am fascinated with the life of Mary Boleyn, mother of Catherine Carey and I thought this would be an interesting book to learn a little more about the life of Catherine Carey. While a piece of fiction it is clear that Adrienne Dillard has done a great deal of research to gather all the facts of Catherine\u2019s life and the events of the time to create a firm basis for her novel. The novel starts off in Calais with Catherine just before she heads to the English Court as a lady in waiting to Anne of Cleves. At this point Catherine learns that her father is not William Carey, Mary Boleyn\u2019s first husband, but in fact King Henry VIII who her mother who was once a mistress. There has been a great deal of debate for centuries over who the biological father of Mary Boleyn\u2019s children was, with some historians arguing that it was Henry VIII while others state that it was Mary\u2019s first husband William Carey. Whomever the real father was, Adrienne Dillard has gone with Henry VIII as being Catherine\u2019s father and this adds an interesting twist to the story and helps to develop the relationship between Catherine and her cousin/half-sister Elizabeth I. Moving from this the story progresses through Catherine\u2019s life, her time at court, her marriage to Francis Knollys and the birth of her thirteen children. Tragically Catherine lost several of her children, which was not at all uncommon for the age, and the emotions within these scenes are absolutely heart wrenching. I felt Catherine\u2019s pain and her loss and the power within these scenes is a true credit to Dillard\u2019s brilliant writing style. As I have started previously while this is a fictional novel in the appendix at the end of the book Dillard speaks about the great deal of research that she went about in order to write her story. It is clear that the whole book is grounded in fact and only the thoughts and feelings of the characters have been elaborated on. Dillard also states which characters have been made up for the purpose of the storyline and why this was done. I give full credit to the author as she acknowledges what is fact and what is fiction. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I learnt a great deal about the life of Catherine Carey and also felt drawn to this remarkable woman who gave birth to thirteen children, survived the turmoil of the short reigns of Edward VI and Mary I and then became close to her sometimes very difficult cousin/half-sister Elizabeth I. Catherine\u2019s life is quite fascinating and the emotions wrapped up within this book pulled me in and captivated me from the very first chapter. I would certainly recommend this book to anyone that is interested in fictional novels with a strong woman as the main character."}, {"userName": "kathleen r.", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41804423-kathleen-r", "userReview": "I thoroughly enjoyed this novel.

The author provided some interesting and educational afterwords, explaining some of the lesser characters who were none-the-less vital to the story.

And Cor Rotto does this well. This story of Catherine Carey, the daughter of Queen Anne Boleyn's sister Mary, who may also be the illegitimate child of King Henry VIII, is someone seldom mentioned in either historical novels or non-fiction accounts of the time. Catherine's upbringing, long-term marriage to Francis Knollys, and her service to multiple royals including Anne of Cleves, Queen Mary I, and Queen Elizabeth I provide the focus of this book. And it does provide readers another way to look at many of the events Tudor buffs know so well. Like the \"boy King\" reign of Edward VI, the persecution of Elizabeth during her sister Mary's reign, the marriages and abdication of Mary Queen of Scots, the mysterious death of Robert Dudley's first wife Amy, and the origins of Robert Dudley's infatuation with Lettice Knollys, daughter of this book's central character, who eventually becomes Dudley's second wife. The story of Catherine Carey herself however seemed to me to lack drama. Despite the fact that she suffered some hardship, including the deaths of several of her 16 children, I found Catherine two-dimensional and emotionally remote. Perhaps this is due in part to Dillard's writing style, which struck me as too contemporary. I love getting totally absorbed in novels where authors are able to recapture the tone of this historical period. And in that regard, I felt Dillard's novel fell short. What I did love is the author's Afterword where she faithfully explains what is fact and what is conjecture in the novel, based on her own substantial research."}, {"userName": "Kenzie Erickson", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51224285-kenzie-erickson", "userReview": "This is such a great book.

I was immediately drawn into Catherine's story and her interesting life that took her from her beloved home at Oxfordshire, Rotherfield Greys to London serving at Court. Dillard's writing masterfully combines fact with fiction, and she skillfully weaves within it the side of Catherine's personal life and the loving marriage she shared with her husband Francis.

A reminder that leaders never stand alone...there is merit to soft power and human connectivity."}, {"userName": "Cathy", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38474531-cathy", "userReview": "I loved this book! Adrienne's careful research and sensitive writing truly brings Catherine and other characters to life. She beautifully highlights the \"ordinary\" in their extraordinary lives and doesn't shy away from the brutal reality of those lives. At the end of Cor Rotto, I felt I had lost a friend...a dear friend with whom I'd shared joys and happiness, heartbreak and disappointment and all this is in between in such a life."}, {"userName": "Mae", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12237265-mae", "userReview": "This is a great book for historians, not so much for the literary. There was no central theme to the novel, rather, it was a recitation of the events of Catherine Carey's life. She was politically savvy and extremely loyal and a mostly overlooked, but important, member of Elizabeth's household. However, if you're looking for drama, scandal, and danger - this novel is not it. If you are interested in the Tudor court and family life in renaissance England, this is the novel for you."}], "description": "The dream was always the same \u2026 the scaffold before me.

Her only comfort is that she and her family are safe in Calais, away from the intrigues of Henry VIII's court. But now Catherine has been chosen to serve Henry VIII's new wife, Queen Anne of Cleves. Just before she sets off for England, she learns the family secret: the true identity of her father, a man she considers to be a monster and a man she will shortly meet.This compelling novel tells the life story of a woman who survived being close to the crown and who became one of Queen Elizabeth I's closest confidantes.", "title": "Cor Rotto: A Novel of Catherine Carey", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23534253-cor-rotto", "average": 4.0, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1425115153l/23534253.jpg", "reviews": 66, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9831586.Adrienne_Dillard", "name": "Adrienne Dillard"}], "type": ["Historical", "Historical", "Fiction", "English History"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23534253-cor-rotto", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24929623-cor-rotto", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34217892-the-raven-s-widow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27154977-catherine-carey-in-a-nutshell"]}
