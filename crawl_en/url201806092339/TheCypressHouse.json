Granted, I got it from the library so I didn\u2019t actually spend any money on it, but the fact that I sought it out and read it after seeing it on here has to count for something, right? (Oh, and I will never watch that Gnomeo & Juliet movie because the damn thing expanded all over my screen if my cursor got within a half-mile of it so that\u2019s one ad that actually made me hate the thing it was selling.)Anyhow, for once Internet advertising was useful because I read an entertaining book that I probably wouldn\u2019t have checked out otherwise. Arlen Wagner is a World War I veteran trying to get by during the Great Depression by working for one of the government coservation projects. He befriends a young man named Paul Brickhill who has a knack for construction and engineering, and when their current job ends, Paul talks Arlen into going down to the Florida Keys with him to work on a bridge project.However, Arlen has a creepy gift. He can tell when people are about to die because he begins seeing them as skeletal figures with smoke in their eyes. On the train to Florida, Arlen begins seeing that everyone on the train is going to die in the near future. He talks Paul into getting off the train with him, but the other men think he\u2019s crazy and continue on towards disaster.Arlen and Paul catch a ride with a slick stranger who makes a stop at an isolated fishing resort run by the beautiful but secretive Rebecca Cady. Before they realize what they\u2019ve gotten into, Arlen and Paul have gotten on the bad sides of a corrupt local judge and sheriff, and then caught in a hurricane. Arlen just wants to get out of the county, but before it\u2019s all over, he\u2018ll be seeing a lot more people with skeleton features and smokey eyes.I hadn\u2019t read Koryta before, but I\u2019ll checking out more of his work. Here, he\u2019s created a period crime piece with a spooky supernatural twist. The haunted Arlen and the gifted but na\u00efve Paul are a couple of great characters, and the Florida beaches and swamps make a nice backdrop for the drama. This is quality fast-paced creepy story telling."}, {"userName": "Lou", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3699303-lou", "userReview": "Check out my interview with Michael Koryta in August 2012 >>http://more2read.com/review/interview-with-michael-koryta/A haunting Cleverly written story.

Many paranormal romances violate this principle four times before breakfast. Fortunately I do not read very many PR. The Cypress House, not a PNR by any definition although there is a romance, failed this particular requirement. The supernatural aspect seems a little hacked on to me. Especially disturbing is how the book description hints at more supernatural horrors. While there is plenty of evil awaiting our protagonist, it is not the supernatural variety.Yet even with that complaint, The Cypress House is an engaging thriller with lots of terrifying moments. Arlen Wagner is an admirably strong hero with demons of his own to struggle with. The villains in this novel are truly villainous. The Southern depression era setting with its hurricanes and swamps lend a colorfully rich background to this thriller. The plot regarding wandering laborers and local corrupt authorities is quite riveting. In fact, I liked this book better than the previously read The Ridge in which the supernatural elements were core to the story.The main thing taken away from this reading is that Michael Koryta is an excellent writer and a truly gifted storyteller. While I would prefer more emphasis on the supernatural, Koryta's tale focusing on the horrors of our fellow humans is not to be taken lightly.

Koryta has a great writing style, it's no wonder he has a large following. Characters in this book are engaging and vivid. The flavor and atmosphere of the day (1935) is there throughout, along with the description of the hurricane and it's aftermath. The paranormal aspect of this book seems, well, normal, to the characters in terms of their reality and to the reader it becomes a plausible aspect. I'll be looking up other books from this author to read and I highly recommend this book, even if you're not a paranormal book fan....you will be. Stay tuned....____________________________________________________________________________________________________I started The Cypress House 2 days ago and I'm about 100 pages in. First of all I'm sorry I did not discover this author Michael Koryta sooner, it's certainly no fault of his I just need to get out more - I guess. Right off the bat Koryta grabs you and pulls you into the story as if you were already riding along, I love this and it's something all the best authors are able to do. The reviews you may have seen regarding this book and author, the positive ones, in my humble opinion are all true. Having messaged back and forth with Michael Connelly in the recent past I can tell you he doesn't twist the truth for anyone....EVER. So, if he says this guy's\"...the best of the best...\", and I agree, then that's what he is, you can take that to the bank. OK, back to our story....There is nothing standard issue about this tale or the way Koryta rolls it out. He breaks a few writing rules and it works to make this story, and the critical backstory, bring you up to speed on a drama playing, and about to play out, with ominous tie-ins to the characters recent history. Then, as a killer hurricane threatens the south coast of 1935 Florida (something the author beautifully and fully captures in flavor and setting)something happens to the good(or maybe not-so-good) samaritan who helps our 2 heroes out while on their way to a work camp in the Florida Keys. Our main character has a special skill, a skill he does not want and it allows him to see things he does not want to see. I'm not one for cliches', though I can only dream my own books will be spoken of this way, but, this book IS one of those you won't be able to put down. I'm thrilled to have discovered not just this great thriller but this author. More soon as I read through The Cypress House. ________________________________________________________________________________________________________I'm very much looking forward to reading this book, having grown up in LA and Florida. FL mostly. I am a lover of the tropics so anything based in this area in my fav genre is sure to catch my attention. I will get back to you on this book soon, and other books by this author, Michael Koryta."}, {"userName": "Jason", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2613919-jason", "userReview": "4 StarsI really enjoyed this period piece thriller that has a tiny bit of supernatural added in for flair and color. This is my first Koryta novel that I have read, but I am now a fan and will be sure to read his other works.This novel's strength is that it is built around a very likable, believable, and rememberable protagonist named Arlen. The side characters are colorful and sufficient to compliment Arlen. Corridor County, the town, the place itself was to me the second strongest character of this book. The time period of the 1930's depression era was also a tangible player in this crime thriller. I loved the way that all the action, the events, and the main plots were shaped by the setting and the time.The supernatural aspect of this book is small, and not completely necessary, but it works. It gives this story it's heart and emotion. The backstories of all the main characters also add to our investment in their outcome. Their stories are the reason we care about them by the books end. Arlen is a strong and able hero that could easily carry a series. Even though we learn a great deal about the man, it is very clear that there is much more to him than we are given. He appears to know more than he lets on. He seems to be too prepared to be just a man looking for work. Arlen is also a man that has an extraordinary gift that for most his life he has shunned and down played.The setting and the time make this book an immersive read. You are there at the old time bayou setting. You can hear the howling hurricane force winds. You can \u00a0smell the ocean, the beaches, and the farmers fields. You can almost feel the heat of the scorching Florida sun. I love well done period pieces, and Koryta has done a fine job at recreating Florida of the 1930's. I loved the backstories and the themes that play throughout. \"Love Lingers\" as Arlen's father used to tell him.The plot is fairly straight forward and does include a couple of twist along the way. There is not a lot of action but the end sequences are competent and suffice to tie up our story. The supernatural is done with a light touch that only adds to the time frame novel, not detract from it. I will be sure to read more of Koryta and highly recommend this book to those that like a good thriller, noir, and depression era pieces."}, {"userName": "Jane Stewart", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3789528-jane-stewart", "userReview": "2 \u00bd stars. Bad subject matter for me, artificial secret keeping, stupidity, too much helpless victim feel.This was not entertaining or fun. I was not surprised or delighted. I liked the beginning, but the longer I read the more annoyed and frustrated I felt. The biggest problem was subject matter. The second problem was people keeping secrets for no good reason.SECRETS:Secrets were used to create mystery and conflict. They did not make sense. Some were stupid. Several times I wanted to shake a character and say \u201ctell them.\u201dArlen loves Paul like a son and does things to help and protect Paul. At the end of the book, Paul has been given a gift from an anonymous source. Arlen is the source but does not tell Paul he did it. Why keep that secret? It was the end of the book and I was ready for some happy feelings, but instead I get another secret. I was annoyed.Many of the secrets were Rebecca not telling Arlen what was going on. Arlen also kept secrets from Paul. I liked Envy the Night by this author. In that book characters didn\u2019t tell all they knew, but it fit their motivations.SUBJECT MATTER - METAPHOR STYLE:Two guys are looking for work and accidentally walk into a nest of poisonous snakes. Instead of running away like sane people, they stay because of a pretty girl. The leader of the snakes tells the girl he will kill her brother if she doesn\u2019t do what he wants. The brother is tied up. She thinks as soon as he gets untied they can leave. But when he is no longer tied, he wants to stay. She doesn\u2019t tell him the snakes are poisonous. And she continues to NOT tell him. Most of the story is about snakes threatening good guys.In contrast, in Envy the Night by Koryta, thugs come to town and have no idea that two very skilled and talented good guys will cause problems for them. That was fun because the good guys had some control. That is also what\u2019s going on with the fabulously successful Jack Reacher series (by Lee Child). Thugs have no idea what they\u2019re up against when they meet Reacher. In Cypress, the good guys have no power and suffer.I feel helpless when I think about corruption in the world around me. I read fiction to feel good. I want to see someone with control. Books like this pull me down rather than up. ACTUAL STORY BRIEF:Arlen was a soldier in WWI who is now traveling with Paul looking for work during the depression. They pass through a town where the judge and sheriff are part of a drug organization. When Arlen and Paul arrive, the judge and sheriff put them in jail, beat them, and take all their money. When they get out of jail, instead of leaving they hang around.A secondary story is Arlen\u2019s psychic gift. He sees smoke in the eyes of people who will die. His father had a psychic gift of talking to people after they died.OPINION ABOUT THE PSYCHIC TALENTS:The story was good in the beginning about Arlen\u2019s gift. And the ending climax scene had some of this which was very good. But the main story would have been better if it focused more on this gift - having more psychic things happening during the middle of the book.Another annoyance: Arlen kept insisting that his father was insane which was not true. And Arlen did not believe his father had a psychic ability. Because Arlen had his own psychic gift, it did not make sense that he disbelieved his father\u2019s.MY FAVORITE PART:Paul was fun to watch and think about. He was a 19-year-old engineering genius. He was in control when it came to machines and structures.NARRATOR:The narrator Robert Petkoff was pretty good. But I have mixed feelings about his southern drawl for Arlen.DATA:Narrative mode: 3rd person. Unabridged audiobook length: 11 hrs and 54 mins. Swearing language: moderate but rarely used. Sexual language: none. Number of sex scenes: 3 referred to no details. Setting: 1935 mostly Florida gulf coast with a little back story. Book copyright: 2011. Genre: paranormal mystery suspense.OTHER BOOKS:I really enjoyed Envy the Night by this author. Gave it 5 stars."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/304456-jennifer", "userReview": "My newish way of life in which I don't have to finish every book doesn't always work. Like, I kept reading this one, thinking I just needed to give it more of a chance. There was one final apex shoot-em-up bloody scene that was interesting. However, my problem for most of the early book was the introduction of shallow characters who spoke as though they had depth, but they didn't really. They'd each allude to some deep dark secret they carried, but they'd be like, \"now isn't the time,\" or \"I've never told a soul\" kind of business, until I finally didn't care anymore. And then suddenly, and seemingly without adequate motivation, they'd spend a chapter regurgitating the whole secret past, start to finish, \"telling, not showing,\" like they used to caution us not to do in college. Each secret narrative started with something like, \"well, I s'pose the time has come to tell you, blah blah blah\" and I would wonder why?

I had never heard of this Michael Koryta guy before but the unusual premise for this one grabbed my attention immediately, and a few enthusiastic reviews here on GR convinced me to give it a try. This book is all kinds of awesome, and I think what I enjoyed about it the most is that it\u2019s so hard to categorize \u2013- it\u2019s like ten genres in one. That isn't to say the book is confused, far from it. Koryta has such control over the magic he weaves here. He is a skilled storyteller, an absolute master at pacing and plot. His descriptive prose is so lush on the one hand and so cuttingly precise on the other that the entire novel unfolds in cinematic detail. I could see and feel everything \u2013 like the thick humidity of the swamp, sweaty and heavy on my skin making it hard to breathe. I smelled the sickening fetid rot and the coppery stench of blood. My pulse raced with fear and worry, my bile rose in disgust and outrage. I lusted for revenge and prayed for forgiveness. I carried the characters\u2019 guilt and heart ache on my shoulders and longed for their escape and redemptionKoryta manages to accomplish so much here \u2013 a supernatural tale firmly grounded in realism containing aspects of both the historical and the crime novel. There is mystery, there is love, there is corruption, there is betrayal, there is friendship. In an interview Koryta explains: while I grasp the idea of genre differences, I\u2019ve never particularly cared about them as a reader. I can be equally entertained by Elmore Leonard or Stephen King or Pat Conroy. They are all gifted storytellers, and if you\u2019re telling me a good story I\u2019m not \u2026 inclined to worry about the genre. Amen, ain\u2019t that the truth? I always thought so anyway.

I\u2019m sure of it. I see it in you. You\u2019re going to need to believe. And something you need to know, son? Love lingers.\u201dArlen Wagner\u2019s father told him this before he was shot to death. All because people thought he was insane, including his son. Isaac Wagner claimed he could talk to dead people. Arlen wouldn\u2019t realize he was telling the truth until he himself was able to do the same. Hard to believe someone has supernatural powers until you have them yourself.The author captured the setting in the early 1930s perfectly, rife with people desperate for jobs and money. Arlen and his traveling companion Paul were on a train headed to the Keys to get paid doing labor for the CCC- Civilian Conservation Corps. Arlen is a wonderful main character. He is a wise, experienced, honest man with a calm demeanor that made sure to make things right. He is a war veteran that has seen more than what most people see in their lives and gives him an air of omniscience. He is able to see if people were going to die by seeing either smoke in their eyes or their body as a skeleton. While on the train, he sees everyone as skeletons, and tells them they need to get off the train. Noone believes him, so they proceed onward to the Keys without Arlen and Paul. That left Arlen and Paul hitching a ride to a town that had a lot in store for them, despite its beauty.The town they ended up in was run by corrupt men including the Sheriff, judge, and all their henchmen. The judge Solomon Wade was the man in charge that kept his people paid and under his rule. He got men (and women) killed that he didn\u2019t like and told Arlen that \u201cAll these people are smoke and I am the match.\u201d Arlen had sensed the town was \u201coff\u201d and realized noone was able to leave the town since they would be able to tell outside authorities of the corrupt leaders running the show there. There was a big storm and he and Paul stayed at the Cypress House and remained after the storm to earn some money fixing up the place, since the sheriff had stolen all their money. Paul is infatuated with the owner of the inn, Rebecca who old enough to be his mother. Arlen ends up falling in love with her and when Paul learns of this he takes off. Arlen learns of the sheriff\u2019s hold on Rebecca and plans to get Rebecca, her brother Owen and himself out of there alive. The plot ensues and there is a lot of bloodshed and twists involved. I really enjoyed this book. The writing was very much like Arlen\u2019s demeanor and the nature surrounding the town, calm and subdued, but packed with a punch.

It is a love story in many ways as well as a crime and violence filled occult tale of how people can be trapped in situations beyond their control. Michael Koryta is an artist. His characters have such life that it is simplicity itself to visualize them and their surroundings. I read the book while in Florida and found myself looking around for some of the scenery or characters. The story was set in a time of depression and post war trauma. That setting resonated with today\u2019s recession and returning veterans. War changes people and Koryta captured that essence of humanity. I also liked how he showed a love between two unrelated men that had nothing to do with gender bias or sexual preference. Sometimes the depth of friendship is love that has absolutely nothing to do with sexuality. That type of relationship seems practically taboo in contemporary fiction. Arlen Wagner\u2019s skepticism of his own talent promoted belief in what he experience, much more than a simple presentation of that talent. This the second of his books I have read and I will be actively seeking out the rest.

I got a copy of So Cold the River at BEA last year, and was completely blown away at how amazing it was. This book is better. It's so amazing that I can't even talk about it, because I don't have a vocabulary to express how much everyone needs to read this book. (And yes, as an English major who reads books the way I do, I do find that shameful.)But I love this book so much, I have lost the words. So please read this book so that we can be speechless together. :) (And read So Cold the River, too. Just don't drink the water.)"}, {"userName": "Crystal Craig", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4729956-crystal-craig", "userReview": "My first Michael Koryta novel was \u201cSo Cold the River\u201d, which is one of my favorite books. I recommend it to everyone. I was excited to begin \u201cThe Cypress House\u201d. The cover has the same eerie look to it as So Cold the River does; unfortunately, the story was nowhere near as good. My attention was grabbed immediately as I read the first few chapters. The events on the train sucked me right into the thick of things. Right away I felt the creepy, mysterious vibe that Koryta evokes so well in his books. In no time, I found myself getting attached to the main character, Arlen, and immediately, I became curious about his \u201cspecial gift\u201d. As I read on, the book started to fall a little flat. Not to the point of me becoming uninterested, or distracted \u2013 that never happened, but the plot sort of went in a direction I wasn\u2019t expecting it to go. I didn\u2019t care about the corrupt judge and his goons\u2014I was more engrossed with the supernatural elements. I didn\u2019t really care for the Rebecca character at all. She seemed flat and cold. I really enjoy Michael Kortya\u2019s writing. His books have that Stephen King feeling to them, but he doesn\u2019t ramble on forever like King does. This book was a solid 3.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Cindy Meilink", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2644076-cindy-meilink", "userReview": "Very seldom does a \"perfect\" book come along\u2013a book with strong believable characters, an enthralling plot, and dialogue so rich that you can immerse yourself inside it\u2013The Cypress House is such a book.Arlen Wagner is a man with a gift, or a curse, depending on one's perspective.

I think. I literally just finished this, and perhaps reviewing it so soon won't do it the justice I think it deserves. It was strange, unusual, and altogether different from anything I've read in a long time. And I liked it! It definitely doesn't fit the mould of a 'whodunit' as so many of my previous reviews do, but it is an exciting thriller with just enough supernatural to make it enjoyable without being over the top.The basic premise is what I loved most - Arlen Wagner can see death. Let me elaborate. The year is 1935 and Wagner is a WWI veteran who works on construction projects. His father, an undertaker, was thought to be insane over his belief that he could communicate with the dead. But now Arlen has his own dark skills, and is able to see death manifest itself in the soon-to-be-dead. One would imagine such a skill would be incredibly sobering during the war years, and Arlen does his best to avoid it. However, on a train one night, he looks around to see death in the eyes of all his fellow passengers. Bound for Florida Keys and unbeknownst to the men, they are travelling around the time of the infamous Labour Day hurricane that killed over 400 people. Arlen tries to warn his fellow passengers, but only himself and a young man named Paul Brickhill refuse to re-board the train. They stumble out of harms way (albeit temporarily) and into the corruption of Depression-era Corridor County. A man, Walt Sorenson, takes a chance on the two of them, and the find themselves at an eerily remote inn, Cypress House, and in the presence of its beautiful but mysterious owner, Rebecca. Witness to a horrific crime, Arlen and Paul are thrown into a dark and shady world of corruption and cover up, where people in post-prohibition times are doing their best to survive... at a terribly high price for those around them. Surprises and unexpected plot twists await, with a final act worthy of a Hollywood blockbuster or a top-10 bestselling novel. The Cypress House, while not your typical crime novel, is full of grizzly murders and more than enough bloodshed, making it feel like one. Add to it a constant feeling of suspense mixed with dread, and this novel will keep you up all night; all the while sending chills down your spine at the horror of how far some people will go to for power, money and glory. The characters are both likeable yet flawed, and Koryta rivals my personal favourite Stephen King for showing how rotten humans can become when they are given extreme amounts of power. Loathing the locals becomes easy, and the reader will find themselves cheering on our protagonists as they try and bring some much-needed justice to the people of Corridor County. All in all, I finished this 415 gem in a small number of days, and I urge you to pick it up and do the same."}, {"userName": "Patricia", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/985726-patricia", "userReview": "Imagine looking at a whole group of people and seeing a trace of smoke in all their eyes and knowing that that they will all be dead soon. This is what Arlen Wagner experienced one night on a Florida train. This was not the first time Arlen had premonitions of death and it wouldn\u2019t be the last time. Arlen was unable to convince the other men to leave the train but nineteen-year-old Paul Brickhill respected Arlen and agreed to abandon the train. Arlen and Paul were headed for the Florida Keys to help build a bridge. Arlen had met Paul when he went to work for the Civilian Conservation Corps. Paul was a boy from Jersey and Arlen got the feeling that Paul was something special. Paul and Arlen are stuck at the train station with no hope of a train until the next day so they decide to walk five miles to the nearest boarding house to spend the night. A new car comes by and stops to pick up the two but Arlen is hesitant to accept a ride. Paul, impressed with the car, insists so the two get in the car with a man who introduces himself as Walt Sorenson. This chance meeting ends up with the three arriving at The Cypress House, an isolated Gulf Coast boardinghouse. Rebecca Cady is a beautiful woman and runs The Cypress House. A hurricane is on the way and Arlen wants to move on but as Sorenson leaves to move his car, the car explodes leaving Sorenson dead and Paul and Arlen stranded.The two stay to help Rebecca through the hurricane but nothing is right at The Cypress House. Arlen feels that danger lurks in The Cypress House but Paul refuses to leave. Paul has a young man\u2019s crush on Rebecca and is determined not to abandon her. Arlen also is attracted to Rebecca but his instincts tell him that he must get Paul to leave or the boy will meet with death.An intriguing book with a bit of the supernatural. The Cypress House will keep you guessing and turning the pages to reveal the entire story behind The Cypress House and why Rebecca insists on staying even though she is in grave danger."}, {"userName": "Scott Rhee", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5717792-scott-rhee", "userReview": "Michael Koryta's latest suspense thriller is a slight departure from his usual crime novels, but it is a satisfying departure. \"The Cypress House\" is set during the '30s, during the era of the Depression and Prohibition. The story's protagonist, Arlen Wagner, has the supernatural ability to see when a man is going to die. Death shows itself to him as a flicker of smoke reflected in the victim's eyes. He can't see how they will die, only that it will happen soon. When he sees the smoke flicker in the eyes of every single inhabitant of the train that he and his young friend, Paul, are on, he has no choice but to get off. Sure, he tries telling people, but they think he's crazy. He and Paul exit the train, and they are left to hitchhike the desolate roads of southern Florida. The only place to stay is a once-regal now-decaying boarding house called the Cypress House, owned by a beautiful but mysterious young woman. When the only other boarder, a bootlegger named Sorenson, dies in a fiery explosion when his car inexplicably blows up, the local law enforcement arrest Arlen and Paul. There is no interrogation, only a beating and a cold cell to sleep in. Thus begins the suspenseful roman noir that resurrects the dark and hard-boiled fiction of Jim Thompson and the Depression-era humanity of John Steinbeck. Throw in some Stephen King and Peter Straub, and you have a fantastic crime thriller with a supernatural twist. Koryta has a flair for character development, dialogue, pacing, and action, which is probably why he is quickly becoming one of the hottest new writers in the mystery/crime genre. If you like great writing and a great story, check this one out."}, {"userName": "Andy Plonka", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/749242-andy-plonka", "userReview": "Despite my aversion to paranormal elements in novels, I am quite intrigued with Michael Koryta's handling of this topic. In The Cypress House his main character can detect impending death in people he meets as well as sense the possibility of his own death. This ability is well defined and Koryta is consistent with the parameters he sets for this ability. Thus the story line retains the reality of which humans are normally aware but adds a dimension that is believable. The story basically involves illegally obtained drugs being sold by politicians who control all the money in a small town in Florida's panhandle which doesn't sound very exciting, but in Koryta's capable hands it commands the reader's attention."}, {"userName": "Janette Fleming", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2917516-janette-fleming", "userReview": "Synopsis: Arlen Wagner has seen it in men before--a trace of smoke in their eyes that promises imminent death. He is never wrong. When Arlen awakens on a train one hot Florida night and sees death's telltale sign in the eyes of his fellow passengers, he tries to warn them. Only 19-year-old Paul Brickhill believes him, and the two abandon the train, hoping to escape certain death. They continue south, but soon are stranded at the Cypress House--an isolated Gulf Coast boarding house run by the beautiful Rebecca Cady--directly in the path of an approaching hurricane.

But Paul refuses to abandon Rebecca to face the threats alone, even though Arlen's eerie gift warns that if they stay too long they may never leave. Michael Koryta does American Gothic very, very well and The Cypress Tree is no exception with its dazzling blend of noir ingredients - small-town corruption, lies, deceit and the Great Depression. The whole blend is shot through an atmosphere that drips with menace and fatalism, impending doom and just a touch of supernatural shenanigans. Strong characterisations, rich sense of time and place, a well written plot and the hint of a tragic love triangle make this a steamy, southern slow burner to savour.

Enigmatic characters, wonderful weaving plot that seriously gives no clues to where it's going to lead to but continually gets tighter and tighter (so you know it's not going anywhere good) and a very creepy location to settle it down into. Add in a little supernatural twist to the mystery, a drop of a love story and you've got a really fascinating, nail biting story! It's wonderfully written. You can feel the place (honestly!!) when he writes. This book had me going right from the first sentence and you couldn't put it down. Dark and dangerous with that supernatural element that never seems to be too far from the surface - but isn't the focus of the story - so it teases you to find out where it will come into play. The story builds in tension and mystery and Michael Koryta reveals things like a strip tease - bit by bit, without showing the whole thing just to keep you waiting and watching.

I very seldom carry a book around the house with me, but I did this one, taking every chance I could to read more about the isolated Florida Gulf Coast boarding house that our hero, Arlen Wagner finds himself stranded at. This story has all the things that draw me into a good book: a strong yet flawed hero;,a damsel in distress; a plot that twists and turns and back tracks; evil men who seem to be above the law; a wee bit of supernatual horror; murder;and romatic suspense. Having said all that, it was actually the time and place in history that reeled me in. It is the time of the Great Depression. Angry,poor, hungry, frightened men (some honest, some not) are travelling all over the country looking for a way to make money. The Labor Day Hurricane of 1935, that took such a tragic toll in the Florida Keys helps set the eerie stage for this page-turning novel.

Much it is good. Koryta has a strong grasp on plot and I liked the post-WWI setting and how that war haunts the main character, Arlen, and colors much of his personality. It's a fast-paced, intriguing read. HOWEVER, my biggest complaint is Koryta's writing of the novel's sole female character, Rebecca. Initially, she is an infuriatingly stoic, mysterious beauty who everyone seems to be in love with for some reason, and then she dissolves into \"woman with dark past who needs a man's help.\" Not original. In one scene, she becomes nude for no good reason and is described by a male character has having a body that is \"soft and absent of fat.\" Really? This flaw in the novel was especially distracting to me because I study the depiction of women in literature and the media, so others with less of a focus on that area may not have as much of a problem with Rebecca."}, {"userName": "Jaime", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/159833-jaime", "userReview": "This wasn\u2019t at all what I expected.

Koryta gives us an unusual guy in an unusual situation, yet manages to make it all seem perfectly normal. Arlen\u2019s \"gift\" \u2014 the ability to see that someone is \"marked for death\" \u2014 could have been the centerpiece of the story. In fact, I expected it to be. Instead, it\u2019s just another thing about Arlen, and you even find yourself forgetting about it at times. It remains important to the plot, and influences several of Arlen\u2019s decisions, but it doesn\u2019t overwhelm it. I really liked the twists and turns and surprising places this story takes us, especially when Arlen shows his bad-ass side.
