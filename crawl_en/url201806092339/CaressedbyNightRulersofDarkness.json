It was set in the Regency period and the vampire King Dorian was sooooo alpha and sexy. This new installment did not wow me but I like this series and will read book 3 when it comes out. Weaknesses...The hero is vampire Dimitri Arsov. He is the last remaining pure vampire and has come back from the dead. No, he was never dead but just taking a 400 year nap because that's when his mate would be at humping age and living in Vegas. There could have been more but that's how I interpeted it. Dimitri had so much potential that was never fully developed. His story seemed all over the place. He felt very commercial. That pissed me off because Ms. Greene has skills. I felt she didn't go as deep as she could have based on her first book. Kerstyn Ingmar is the heroine and his mate, she was also a little too simple and commercial. I can't stand those broke women meeting sexy, rich, and generous men -- jump in bed on a whim then whine --- \"I don't want your money, cars, and influence\". I would like to for once to meet a heroine who has a little gold digger in her blood.Strengths...The love story moved fast but it made sense. I enjoyed the heat between the characters and I felt they were a great fit. The biggest strength for the book was the supporting characters. There are at least three characters that need their own books. The foundation Ms. Green laid out for the future heroes has me salivating. I am so in for future installments. I liked the move to the present day. I like the fact that the witches were explained in this book. I could not work with that magicless batch from book one. Ms. Greene explained the magic clearly in this one and I like where she has gone with it. The historical elements are delivered via memories but I could visualize it quite well.All in all, it wasn't perfect for me. It's a bridge book and uses too many pre-packaged plot devices. I didn't feel the full power of what I think Ms. Greene can do but it's still a very good read. BTW -- this is more romance than fantasy. This is also much more erotic than the first book which was intense for Regency. If you are a vamp fan, you need to hit this series."}, {"userName": " ~*~Princess Nhya~*~", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3055882-princess-nhya", "userReview": "This one I'm going to have to give only 2 and half stars. I can't quite put my finger on it, but there was just not enough there between Dimitri & Kerestyn. Everything about their meeting, to their \"relationship\" to their union was just too easy. Way too fast. Too simple. And not believable or even emotionally charged in my opinion.Now I loved Gannon (would not mind knowing more about him) I'm very intrigued with Gabriel and the obvious opening for his story that you will read about in this book. And of course at the end, I'm a bit intrigued by Falcon & Sonya. Heck even Hadrian. But the way this story unfolded, I will admit it had a few moments as far as the suspense and action. But even these moments were fleeting. Holding no real sinister darkness either. Even with the \"villian\" Ven.. Puh-Lease! And for most of this story, your two main characters read with no true depth. As individuals or as a couple. I need to feel that this type of connection is there. It doesn't work when the author is just \"saying\" it is there. I need to feel it & see it. Therefore I will love it. But I didn't get this with Dimitri & Kerestyn.Now I will admit I did read this series out of sequence. I have not read the first book. But since I am not a huge fan of Historical-Paranormal books, I chose to bypass it. I was able to follow the story here, with no confusion when things in the past referring to the first book, were brought up. So I doubt that my not reading the first book, affects my feelings and views concerning this one. I was just really not feeling this one all that much. Although, I would always come back to see if things improved. So I guess that's saying something huh? It keeps you interested enough to come back. I'm still on the fence on whether or not I will read the first book. So, if you are a fan of Ms. Green and you have read the 1st book and like it, then I would recommend you read this one. If your views are like mine, then hey, the choice is up to you."}, {"userName": "texxie-PRUFreads.blogspot.com", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4833647-texxie-prufreads-blogspot-com", "userReview": "My rating: 4.5 out of 5 starsWith a growl, Dimitri placed his feet flat on the bed and thrust his hips up, impaling her hard and deep. \"Suck,\" he hissed.***Please note, this book was gifted to me by the author***Chapter 27. Once you've read this book, you will know exactly what I mean. No really, trust me on this one...First and foremost, I would like to thank Ms. Greene for giving me to the opportunity to read and review this second installment of her Rulers of Darkness series. I fell in love with Dorian in book 1 but I think Dimitry has stolen my heart.Dimitry Arsov,the only remaining pure bred vampire, is back from the dead so to speak. He faked his death 400 years ago after a traitorous attack on his life by his would be successor.He has remained hidden, both his powers and his need for revenge strengthening. Dimitri is smooth, regal, yet cryptic and intimidating. He's tall and blonde, eyes a near colorless shade of blue. A Norse God, if you will, who will blush from time to time. *thud* I absolutely loved Dimitr's display of power as he revealed his wishes to Gabriel.

This is a complex tale that will engage you in many ways. At the same time it\u2019s still fast paced and fun. The author\u2019s exquisitely vivid descriptions bring this story to life in a big way. It is positively sinful! Greene also continues to develop her unique concept of the vampire world without shattering our preconceived notion. It all rolls up into an unforgettable story.And don\u2019t even get me started on the characters. What a fantastic cast we have here. I loved the main couple. They were such diverse individuals, yet they came together giving to each other, and completing one another. The art history aspect of the tale adds an extra layer to the story that I found to be quite intriguing. The fact that the main character had actually achieved her PhD made her that much more admirable. The supporting cast was also breathtaking. I loved getting to know everyone and appreciated how involved in the story they all were.This novel is fun, funny, sexy, and exciting all rolled into one. If you want a paranormal romance with a dash of spice and a frosting of originality this is the one for you.Please note that I received a complimentary copy of this work in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Alyssa :::Riverina Romantics:::", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2480541-alyssa-riverina-romantics", "userReview": "Posted At: Riverina Romantics My Rating: 4 out of 5 *Heat Rating: 4 out of 5 \u2661You\u2019re dead. Everyone believes you\u2019re dead. So they won\u2019t be too surprised when you come back to life, right?Dimitri is the last living pureblood vampire, believed to be dead at the hands of a corrupt and tyrannical clan leader. But he\u2019s not. He\u2019s been plotting his return for centuries, having a score to settle with the fool who crossed him. There is nothing in the world that can stop him from his revenge\u2026except possibly Kerstyn, his one true mate.Dimitri was not what I expected him to be, and I enjoyed the hell out of him because of it. Usually those \u2018last remaining pureblood\u2019 types are assholes because they have not been \u2018diluted\u2019 over the centuries of making vampires. But Dimitri was anything but. He was classy, respectful, and wise. He was never in a hurry, understanding that sometimes time is the best weapon. He was the kind of guy that would sweep any romantic off their feet in seconds. However, his polite demeanor was only one side of the person he truly was. He was deadly, in every sense of the word. You do not want to cross him, for he can kill you in thousands of ways without breaking a sweat. He was a force to be reckoned with, one that may or may not be able to be controlled. He was incredibly loyal and very patient. His passion was all-consuming and heart-melting. He was truly a blend of light and dark. The perfect scorching hot lover, and genuine soulmate.I liked Kerstyn. She was just a beautiful person, inside and out. She cared about her friends and family. She was intelligent and strong. She was loyal, even when it felt like she was being abandoned. She had a pure heart, and that made her such a wonderful person. Kerstyn knew what hardship was like and when Dimitri became her knight in shining armor, she did her best to repay him for everything. She was a hard worker, always striving to succeed and be the best she could. Again, we come to how she accepted the news of what Dimitri is, and again I feel like she accepted it too easily. However, with how strong of a person she was, it was still believable. I just think a little more \u2018freak out\u2019 would have been appropriate. But she was accepting and understanding and someone who would have your back, even against a bunch of vampires and witches. She was the right fit for someone like Dimitri, an anchor in the storm.This was another great book in the Rulers of Darkness series. I loved how the events in this one played out and flowed into each other. It really felt like it was smooth and non-stop and it built all the tension and drama in a way that kept me turning pages. I\u2019m really excited to see where things will go with Sonya and Falcon. And poor Hadrian! I hope things work out of him too! Excited to see what the next book will bring."}, {"userName": "WildAboutBones", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5291301-wildaboutbones", "userReview": "\"Sin, danger and sex all in one\"\n is how Kerstyn describes Dimitri. This second in the Rulers of Darkness series is even better than the first. Vampires and witches take center stage in Greene's world (but shifters, currently off screen, are coming out of the background in future books). There is a lot of simmering chemistry between the characters as well as romance.While the first book had a historical setting, this one fast forwards to present day. While you don't need to have read the first book in the series before reading this one, you'll have background knowledge of and be familiar with many of the characters in this story if you do. When I picked up this ARC, I couldn't remember anything about the first other than I liked it a lot. Then I read the glossary Greene put in the front (yay! love it when authors do this) and I remembered more. Then as I got farther into the story I remembered the plot of the first.King Dimitri is back from playing dead for the past 400 years. He let everyone think one of the Red Order (vampire hunting) witches killed him, clearing the way for Ven his second-in-command to take his throne. Dimitri is a vampire but also a seer and knew it was necessary. He teleports into his old friend's office in his Las Vegas casino/hotel/club office and just about gives Gabriel a heart attack, if it was possible for vampires to have them. Dimitri shows up here because he knows he will meet his mate in Vegas.Kerstyn is rushing home and is rescued by Dimitri when three \"men\" attempt to attack her. For some reason this sexy, gorgeous and very tall man makes her feel safe and being in his arms feels like home. As much as she'd like to stay and talk with him more, an emergency at home calls her away. In a single week, she finds herself thrown out of her apartment by her roommate, she loses her job and her car dies. She is so not having a good week. I really like that the first in the series was a historical which gave us a lot of the background and did a lot of the world building for this series but now we are in present day.I also very much like that Dimitri is a darker male lead, but he carries a lot of baggage which makes him vulnerable with Kerstyn. But even with all the baggage, he's not really an angsty guy. I love Kerstyn's response to him and the supernatural world she never knew existed.It is a fast paced, quick read - I stayed up late reading it in one sitting. For a guy who hasn't had sex in centuries, Dimitri is very good at it and makes up for lost time.If you like Zsadist from J.R. Ward's Black Dagger Brotherhood series, Zarek from Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark-Hunter series and the guys from Gena Showalter's Lord of the Underworld series, you will love Dimitri and his friends.There are so many places for this series to go and if the foreshadowing in this book is anything to go by, this is going to be a great series. I am looking forward to the next few books in the series."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4295616-jennifer", "userReview": "I truly enjoyed the first book in the Rulers of Darkness series, Caressed by Moonlight. So I jumped at the chance to be apart of Ms. Greene's blog tour for the second book. Caressed by Night has a different feel to it since it is set in modern times in Las Vegas verses Caressed by Moonlight's 1800s, London setting. But it has all the same hotness. And you get to see a little of Dorian and Victoria from Caressed by Moonlight which I really liked getting a update on where they are at in their lives. OK, so Caressed by Night is about yet another hot vamp named Dimitri that has been in hiding for about 400 years; waiting for the right time to return to the vampire world. One of Dimitri 's powers is seeing the future. He's had a vision about his mate and knows that she will be in Las Vegas but doesn't really know anything else about her. What she looks like, what's her name, etc.One night Dimitri saves a beautiful young woman from other vampires in an alley not far from the night club she was party with her friends. Once he comes face to face with her, he knows she is his intend mate. But he lets her go.Kerstyn cannot get the sexy man out of her mind that saved her a few nights ago. She dreams about him and he awaking feelings in her that she has never had for another man. Kerstyn is sadden by the thought of never seeing him again. Come on, it's Vegas and he was probably only in town for the weekend. But once Kerstyn finds herself kicked out of her apartment and looking for a new place to live her friend, Silvie helps her out by introducing her to a wealthy friend of hers that might be willing to rent a room out to Kerstyn until she can find her own place.Silvie is not only found a place for Kerstyn to stay but she has also brought her into the supernatural world of vampires and witches. Kerstyn gets more than she has bargained for when she knocks on Silive's friends door...You could read Caressed by Night without reading Caressed by Moonlight and not be lost but I recommend reading both books. They are both really good and the over all plot and character stories are woven into to each other. There are a few story lines that get started with other characters towards the end so I've having a hard time predicting who will be the main character in the next book. It could go two or three ways and I love Greene has set it up to where the direction of the series is not boring and predictable.If you are looking for a hot PNR with some real back bone in the world building and character developed department you need to checkout Amanda J. Greene's Rulers of Darkness Series."}, {"userName": "Sally", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4061109-sally", "userReview": "Amanda J. Greene's Caressed by Night is the second book in her Rulers of Darkness series, following her scintilating debut, Caressed by Moonlight. Whether you're a lover of paranormal romances, or simply a romantic at heart, Amanda knows how to caress just the right emotions in the read, drawing you deeper and deeper into her story, and entangling you with some rather unique twists so that you not only can't let go . . . you won't want to.While I didn't care for the setting here as much as I did in the first book (Amanda transplants us from the gas-lit cobblestone streets of 19th London to the harsh fluorescent glare of 21st centure Las Vegas), it does provide for an interesting avenue to explore the progression of her vampire mythos. Fortunately, Kerstyn and Dimitri are just as enthralling a romantic duo as Victoria and Dorian were in the first volume, so it's very easy to fall back into the mythology. Personally, I liked Victoria slightly more than Kerstyn, although they are both wonderfull independant women, but I found Dimitri slightly more swoon-worthy than Dorian, so it all balances out.The character building is superb, as is the amount of detail Amanda has invested in her vampire mythos. I loved the complexities of Dimitri, with one layer of personality revealed after another, further establishing him as both a romantic hero and a vampire legend. Silvie, Kerstyn's best friend and witch, is another character I found myself instantly attracted to, while the blood-slave-turned-vampire Gabriel successfully managed to overcome my initial frustrations to become another favourite by the end.It goes without saying, of course, that his is another very hot, very sexy, very romantic book with enough steamy bits to make even the most staid reader swoon, but carefully woven into a story that could easily stand on it's own as a straightforward paranormal adventure . . . although it wouldn't be nearly as fun. As was the case with Caressed by Moonlight, this is another self-contained storyline that reaches back to that world, but which also contains enough promise for several new volumes to come."}, {"userName": "Tracey", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11816773-tracey", "userReview": "Dimitri is a pure blood vampire one of the last few, he's been in hiding, well pretending to be dead for a century or two, but now his back and looking for his mate.Kerstyn's luck is not good, her car has died, she has been accused of messing with her room mates boyfriend and she is short of money, also she needs to find somewhere else to live.Another friend is there to help though and suggests she stays with her male friend, who just happens to be Dimitri a VAMPIRE!!Kerstyn feels very comfortable around Dimitri otherwise she wouldn't have agreed to move in, she is no sponger though and wants to support herself - that is the least of her worries, her biggest is how to not jump her new housemate.Dimitri is wildly attracted to Kerstyn and protective but not smothering, he tries his best to keep away after all he is pure blood and has a dark animalistic side that he does not want her to see. Its obvious she discovers he's a vamp and takes it really well, she's intrigued and that is amusing she has so many questions.These two are hot together and their story is really entertaining along with sexy. The characthers from the previous book appear in this story and lots more interesting characthers are introduced.The author does a great job pulling you into their vampy world and keeping you hooked until the end of the book.If you havent read first book you could read this without going back, if you choose to read book 1 its worth noting is a historical paranormal romance where as this one is current day.4 StarsARC REVIEW"}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/251943-kelly", "userReview": "I was suitably impressed with book 1 in this series and the way it slipped paranormal beasties into a historical romance setting. This book propels us into the present and manages to keep the tension that I enjoyed in the first book alive and humming. It helps that Dimitri is a warrior of the old world who has managed to integrate himself nicely into the present. It also helps that we get to see how characters from book 1 have weathered the years since then. I always love that!As far as Kerstyn and Dimitri go, they are suitably hot together. Dimitri's gift of foresight puts a little kink in their happily ever after when he keeps seeing Kerstyn's death but, hey, that's the price you pay for being an uber-powerful vampire king. That's right, your lady friend is on the bad guy's menu. Don't worry, guys, Dimitri can stand firm in the face of adversity. What's one more bump in the road? But seriously, I liked the two of them together and I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop and the really bad things to happen as Dimitri and Kerstyn fell deeper into a relationship.One thing I'm sucker for are secondary characters with some real meat to their stories. I swear that every vampire here could have their own book written about them. That is just FABULOUS to me. We need more vampire goodness and we need it now.

I am truly excited to say Amanda does not disappoint! Her new addition to the Rulers of Darkness series Caressed by Night is as captivating as the first book.Amanda has such talent when it comes to her character development. Her characters have histories and have experienced joy, pain, struggle and everything that goes along with living. You feel as if you know these characters and you can relate to them. Basically you get sucked right in. Add to all of that a delicious dash of paranormal with Amanda's unique twist on vampires and you have a great new series.Keep in mind, Caressed by Night has a very different setting than Caressed by moon light. I read these books fairly close together and it threw me off for a second. The first book is in 1800's London and this book is modern Las Vegas. So be prepared for that. Dimitri the new super swoon worthy main character has been pretending to be dead for about 400 years, you will find out why. One of Dimitri's powers is seeing the future. He has a vision that he will find his mate and that she is in Las VegasWith Caressed by Night Amanda treats us to the history of how vampires came to be. It is very refreshing to read a new version of how vampires were first created. Don't get me wrong it is not a stale history lesson. Amanda has a talent for entwining the information to build this vampiric (is that a word) world with an entrancing story. This is a fun ride of humor, love, passion, war.....you know, all the good stuff.There is so much chemistry and such a balance in this dynamic pairing. Dimitri and Kerstyn really fit for me. They complement each other without all of the inner (I hate him ....I love him...) stuff you get in some books.Yes there is a steamy chemistry between Kerstyn and Dimitri and you will be treated to many hot smexy love scenes. Do not despair within the incredible story you will find the heat.Yes you will see Falcon and Dorian again in this book but you will also meet yummy new characters to make you swoon.Kerstyn - She was raised a rich girl without loving parents and this made her into the strong independent woman that she is. She has such empathy for everyone (even when they don't deserve it). And of course she has red hair.Dimitri - King of the Arsov Clan. A blond Viking like bombshell and WOW is he old! He struggles to maintain control over his vampire demon. He is what I call an onion character with a lot of layers to peel back and secrets within those layers. This very apt description of Dimitri was written by the reviewer at WildAbout Bones on Goodreads. \"If you like Zsadist from J.R. Ward's Black Dagger Brotherhood series, Zarek from Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark-Hunter series and the guys from Gena Showalter's Lord of the Underworld series, you will love Dimitri and his friends. \"Silvie - Best friend of Kerstyn and secretly a witch and high priestess.Gabriel - A VERY swoon worthy vampire. I foresee a book in his future *grin*. He was a former blood slave who was saved by Dimitri . He proclaims to despise humans due to their weakness. His past makes him feel unworthy. I just wanted to hug him and make him all better.Hadrian - Another ruler who was lost to vampire society and hidden away but now returnsGannon - He is a bit of a unexpected kind of dry comic sidekick. \u00bd American Indian & \u00bd witchI t is fabulous the way Amanda writes the characters and story so there is a definite main couple but the other characters are so strong that they are more sub-main characters than weak secondary characters.Several side stories are running throughout, this creates interest andcomplements the main story rather than cause confusion. There are so many ways she can take this series with the next book. I can't pin point who the main characters will actually be.There are few books or series that I choose to own as a physical book but this would be one of them.

Now he has reappeared to get revenge on the person who tried to kill him centuries ago. Kerstyn Ingmar is an art historian who lives a normal life\u2026but she also happens to be the mate Dimitri has waited his whole life for. But Dimitri keeps having visions of a bloody, grim future, and he\u2019ll need to fight destiny if he hopes to save Kerstyn\u2019s life. Caressed by Night is worth a look!Thoughts:For 400 years, pureblood vampire king Dimitri Arsov has been in hiding, letting everyone think he\u2019s dead. He\u2019s spent years plotting his revenge on the man who betrayed him all those centuries ago, and the time has finally come for him to show his face again so he can put his plans into motion. When he saves a beautiful woman, he recognizes her as the mate he\u2019s been longing for.Kerstyn Ingmar lives a pretty ordinary, if somewhat boring, life up until she\u2019s almost attacked and is saved by a sexy, mysterious stranger. As if nearly being assaulted isn\u2019t bad enough, Kerstyn\u2019s roommate kicks her out of her apartment right after that. Homeless and without a job, she desperately needs a place to stay, so when a friend takes her to a mansion owned by a guy who\u2019s willing to let Kerstyn stay there, she\u2019s shocked to discover the place belongs to her handsome savior. She has an instant connection with Dimitri, but he\u2019s keeping a huge secret, and soon Kerstyn finds herself thrust into a world she never imagined could exist.Caressed by Night was a sexy, interesting read with good world-building. Amanda J. Greene\u2019s story is gritty, romantic, and darkly seductive.Kerstyn and Dimitri made a cute couple, and damn, their love scenes were steamy. Dimitri is freaking gorgeous (he\u2019s described as looking like Thor, so yeah\u2026enough said) and seeing this old-fashioned vamp lose control was hot.Individually, Kerstyn and Dimitri were both interesting characters. Kerstyn was sweet and caring, although maybe a bit na\u00efve. I\u2019m not sure I could move into an empty mansion with an obviously dangerous, lethal guy I didn\u2019t know, but then again, if he looked like Thor, I suppose I\u2019d definitely be tempted. I really like how accepting she was of Dimitri, too; I\u2019m so used to heroines freaking out and running for the hills when they find out the men they\u2018re falling for are supernatural creatures, so it was refreshing to read about a heroine that handled the news surprisingly well.Like I said, I found Dimitri and Kerstyn to be an endearing couple, but outside of the bedroom, I felt like there was a lack of spark in their relationship. It seemed that, at times, their connection was a bit forced, which is what made me lower my rating of Caressed by Night. When I read a PNR book, I want the chemistry between the hero and heroine to be exciting and believable. Kerstyn and Dimitri fell in love rather quickly, but once I got over that, I enjoyed watching their relationship progress.Overall, Caressed by Night is a sweet, yet also very erotic book that I\u2019m glad I got the chance to read.Memorable Quote:\u201cKerstyn,\u201d he whispered painfully, achingly. His last attempt to refuse her, but God, he wanted this. He needed this. He needed her. He needed her love, her warmth, her passion. He needed her to take the cold away, to melt the ice surrounding his dead heart.Although Caressed by Night didn\u2019t \u201cwow\u201d me, I was impressed with the world that Amanda Greene came up with, and I had fun reading about Dimitri and Kerstyn.

Being the last pure blood vampire his powers surpass any of his kind and made it possible for him to see these events unfold beforehand and allowed to make arrangements to fake his death. After four hundred years of lying in wait and plotting his revenge Dimitri makes his presents known, and puts his plans of revenge into play. Then everything changes once Dimitri saves the beautiful Kerstyn Ingmar from some unsavory vampires. Kerstyn awakens a hunger in him that threatens to consume him. Cursed with visions of her gruesome death he must find a way to save her and carry out his revenge. But can he have both or will his revenge ultimately kill the mate he has waited centuries for?Kerstyn thought fate must hate her, her best friend accuses her of sleeping with her boyfriend and kick her out, her car breaks down, then she gets laid off from her job. Jobless and homeless unsure what she is going to do, till a friend tells her she has the perfect place for her to rent. It\u2019s a big gorgeous house with an even more gorgeous man in residence. He just so happens to be the sexy hero who saved her the night before. This man awakens desires she has never experienced. Since she is a virgin she has never craved a man\u2019s touch but this man ignites a need in her that rivals her need for air. Can she keep her hormones in check and not jump his bones long enough to rent from him? But when this sexy man not only tells her he will not except rent but she can barrow any of his many expensive cars for as long as she needs. She knows this feels too good to be true, and when it feels that way it usually is, so what's could this man be hiding behind his sexy smile? This was a sexy temperature raising romance. There is plenty of hearts stopping face reddening scenes too keep you warm any rainy spring night. Let me tell you there is sex in every chapter and each scene sexier than the last. The romance that ignites between Dimitri and Kerstyn is very explosive. If you want a good steamy love affair this will definitely do the trick.I loved Dimitri. He is old world sexy, who just happens to look like a Nordic God; who wouldn't swoon over that? He is very noble and tries his hardest to take his time with Kerstyn not rushing her into anything. I love that he treats her so special, but I think he is a bit hard on himself. He should trust her to make a few decisions on her own instead of thinking her knows what is best, and not even giving her the benefit that she may just understand and accept him. I do not like how dead set against turning her he is. I feel that he should want to keep her forever and want her at his side at any cost.Kerstyn is sweet and innocent and she just falls head over heels with this strange man and accepts all the strange and unusual things that keep coming at her with no real pause. I felt that she should have been at least a little wary of him, she shouldn\u2019t have been so easily accepting. She is a little to insecure for me, but she was sweet. She just couldn\u2019t just trust his feeling for her and thought that she was just a passing fancy for him. There is a part at the end that made me a little mad at her, she makes a choice and puts herself in danger for a person who does not deserve her loyalty at all. Over all this was a good hot read. I couldn't put it down had to know what happens. Would have loved a little more if there was a bit more action but still it was good easy read. I enjoyed it enough that I will go back and read the first book in this series Caressed by Moonlight. - Athenna"}, {"userName": "Talina Perkins", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5332294-talina-perkins", "userReview": "(4.5 star top pick review, written by Talina Perkins for Night Owl Reviews)Plot & Character:A delicious morsel of paranormal romance! Ms. Green has delivered another great read and one I anxiously awaited since finishing her debut novel, Caressed by Moonlight. Based on a world filled with curses and powerful rulers of the darkness this series has quickly climbed to the top of my favorites list. At the beginning of the book the author has provided a very helpful and well organized glossary of terms for reference though she does a great job of delicately explaining everything within the story.Caressed by Night is Dimitri and Kerstyn's story that takes place in Sin City. From the beginning the story's pace flowed smoothly with many turns and twists that kept me reading page after page long after I should have been completing other chores. I was fascinated by the alpha persona of the hero, Dimitri Arsov, true ruler of the Arsov vampire clan. He oozed dark power and authority yet reigned in his inner demon allowing him to be gentle and caring with the heroine. Kerstyn Ingmar surprised me on how she handled being thrown from one life style of innocence and ignorance into the dark and dangerous world of the paranormal she knew nothing about. Her ability to accept the change, the reality of vampires existing in her world and her part in this new world blew me away. I loved how she didn't judge, didn't try to make anyone see life through her views and came to mold herself into a human living in a world that normally can not survive such a dangerous realm without losing herself in the process. Sassy and curious she was able to flow from one life into the other with the help of her lover, Dimitri. And seriously, when you have a vampire as old and attractive as the ancient king, I'd want to make sure I could fit into his world too!As the two main characters come to understand their connection fate held in store for them, their story takes us on an adventure filled with high and lows. From heart warming moments of sizzling passion to heart wrenching moments of adrenaline rushes, Ms. Greene held nothing back in delivering a fast paced romance of true love and justice. We also get to meet many of Dimitri's friends. Hadrian and Gabrielle are both intriguing in their own right, followed by Falcon and Gannon. All sparked my interest each time they step on to the page making me anxious for their stories as well.There are many changes to come and adventures for the rulers of darkness I can't wait to take along side all of Ms. Greene's wonderful characters. As Caressed by Night came to a satisfying, end the promise of a wild ride in the next installment couldn't be missed! Writing:With a second release under her belt, Amanda J. Green shows true promise as a highly addictive author for the paranormal romance genre. She writes with such passion for the written word that it jumps right out at you through her great stories and characters. I've read both of her releases and I can say that this author values her readers so much so that she strives to deliver well edited and written stories. I have a feeling she will go a long way! And might I say thank goodness this series is of full length novels!Summary:Rulers of Darkness is a series I fell in love with right from the start. First with Caressed by Moonlight and now with Caressed by Night, Ms. Greene has entranced my imagination with her vampires and the world they walk in. I can't wait for book number three, Caressed by Crimson moon!"}, {"userName": "Franjessca ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3182444-franjessca", "userReview": "Review also posted on Book Lovin' MamasI had to hold off on reading \"Caressed by Night\" because of being bogged down with other books...but I had to make time for it since the third book came out last month. I love this series from Amanda J. Greene.Amanda's \"Rulers of Darkness\" novels captivate you from the first page to the last page. Her world of vampires are sexy, dangerous, and very protective of their heroines.In \"Caressed by Night\", Amanda takes us into modern day Las Vegas, unlike \"Caressed by Moonlight\" which was in the 1800s London timeframe. Dimitri Arsov, King of the Arsov Clan, is back from the dead, at least everyone thought he was dead, but he fooled everyone until he was ready to announce he has always been alive. He has been waiting patiently until the right moment to get his revenge, while also finding his mate. She's alive in present day Las Vegas and he will stop at nothing to have her. He has waited for her for centuries. Now he must save her before she is killed.Kerstyn Ingmar's life was very predictable until the night her best friend chose her boyfriend's words over hers. Now she has to start over and find a place to live and work. Dimitri the stranger who saved her one night is going to save her again, but this time he will introduce her to his world.Kerstyn never thought the creatures of the night were real until Dimitri tells her what is actually out there.Dimitri must keep Kerstyn safe otherwise his visions of her death will come true. He will ask his vampire friends to help him and also a witch who happens to be Kerstyn's best friend.\"Caressed by Night\" goes further into the Rulers of Darkness series and how vampires are everywhere among the humans. They are trying to get back their clans the way they used to be by having the real rulers come back into power. In \"Caressed by Night\", we have Dimitri's enemy that is living a lie because he believed he killed Dimitri and Dimitri will do anything to knock him off that pedestal.I was a little confused at first because when I read \"Caressed by Moonlight\" it was set in the 1800s and I did not realize until about mid-way that \"Caressed by Night\" was based in modern day. One thing that definitely intrigued me was howAmanda brought back previous characters into the storyline and how they are doing now in modern day, Dorian and Victoria, two characters who stole my heart in the first book. Dimitri is one sexy and powerful vampire king who definitely won me over. He had his moments though where he was over-protective, but for someone who sees visions of what is to come, I would be over protective as well.My favorite character was Kerstyn though in this story. She had gone through a lot and still managed to be strong. She even put Dimitri in his place every once in awhile. She was also able to accept Dimitri's world and was happy to know the truth about him and his friends.This seriously is probably one of my top fave vampire series that I have read since I started reading like crazy in 2009. I love Amanda's writing and how she makes vampires not those sweet and sparkly kind. She makes them powerful, dark, and commanding and I look forward to the next book in the series.If you like your vampires like they are supposed to be, then you should check out this series from Amanda J. Greene.I give this book 4.5 moons and highly recommend it to paranormal romance readers and vampire lovers out there."}, {"userName": "Lori {Romancing the Dark Side}", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3500106-lori-romancing-the-dark-side", "userReview": "Amanda Greene's vampires are dark, dangerous and oh so sexy!Betrayed by his would be successor, pure bred vampire Dimitri Arsov faked his death and went into hiding, waiting for the perfect time to reclaim his throne and unleash his revenge on the one who betrayed him. Dmitri is \"back from the dead\" and ready for battle, but things take a different turn when he meets the beautiful Kerstyn who's down on her luck and in need of a knight in shining armor. When Dimitri realizes the woman he has welcomed into home is the mate he's long awaited, he is put to the ultimate test where desire for love outweighs his desire for vengeance.Caressed by Night is a brilliant sequel to the Rulers of Darkness series. Set in modern day, unlike it's predecessor, this story's setting was a delightful surprise. Ms. Greene's vampires are dark, tortured and the definition of Alpha males with a dash of humor and a heavy sprinkling of sexiness! Dimitri is a multifaceted character that will have your heart by the end of the book! He's powerful, daring, manages to be a hopeless romantic and a true gentleman all in one extremely handsome package (in my eyes he's a combination of Zsadist, Rhage and V...what's not to love?!)! You can often feel his internal and emotional struggle to contain his vampire \"beast\" especially when it comes to Kerstyn; it's a little bit of Jekyll and Hyde mixed with Beauty and the Beast.The heroine Kerstyn, while smart and curious, is a little too docile for my tastes. Perhaps it's due to her age and naivete, but I would not have adjusted so quickly to discovering Dmitri's secrets and world. I love an edgier heroine who will challenge the hero and didn't get that from her until halfway through the story, I wish it would have come sooner. I think it's funny that the heroine Victoria in Caressed by Moonlight, seemed to be more modern in her ways than our heroine Kerstyn, in present day! That being said, I loved the combination of Dimitri and Kerstyn as a couple and the passion they brought out in each other. The museum scene had me on edge and on the verge of a cold shower! Ms. Greene sure knows how to leave her readers wanting more..that's all I'm going to say.A deeper look into the world of the Rulers of Darkness and their tormented past is one of the highlights of Caressed by Night. All of the characters are well developed and naturally mesh, the appearance of old and addition of new characters brings the story full circle. Romance, friendship and betrayal are just part of the web Amanda Greene weaves in her world of the supernatural. Her creativity and eye for details makes her a phenomenal storyteller that will leave you breathless and wanting a vampire of your own!{ebook courtesy of author for review}Original Romancing the Darkside:http://romancingthedarkside.blogspot...."}, {"userName": "Ramblings From A Chaotic Mind", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4034147-ramblings-from-a-chaotic-mind", "userReview": "Kerstyn is just not having a good week. She barely escapes a brutal attack, she lost her job, and now her friend is kicking her out. Jobless and homeless Kerstyn isn\u2019t sure what step to make next. A good friend points her in the direction of Dimitri, who has a room she may be able to rent. She never expected that room to be in a mansion or that the elusive man was the same man who saved her from the viscous attack.Vampire king Dimitri has been waiting centuries for his one true mate and now he\u2019s found her. He has no plans of letting her go or putting her in any danger. She\u2019s special. She\u2019s his. He will have to face a old foe to ensure she stays safe and sacrifice might just be his undoing.Caressed By Night is the second book in Amanda Greene\u2019s self published, Rulers of Darkness, series featuring age old vampires. I did not read the first in the series simply because it\u2019s a historical and since I don\u2019t read much of that, after reading the blurb, I decided not to read it. When I saw the blurb from this one and that it wasn\u2019t historical I jumped all over it.I was pleasantly surprised by Greene\u2019s writing skills. This was plotted out nicely and followed a lively timeline that didn\u2019t really leave me bored\u2026.much. I liked the addition of all the secondary characters and even though I didn\u2019t read Caressed By Moonlight, I enjoyed Dorian in this book immensely. The camaraderie with Dimitri livened up some of the dull scenes since it is a decently lengthy novel. Some of the world building got to be a bit much at time and so I think that may have added to the dull moments I experienced briefly.Where this one fell a bit short for me was in the connection between Dimitri and Kerstyn. When it worked it worked\u2026and when it didn\u2019t, it fell flat. I had a hard time believing a woman, even one as desperate as Kerstyn, would shack up with someone she didn\u2019t know. Especially after she finds out he\u2019s a vampire. She gave some meager attempts to talk herself out of it, but Dimitri\u2019s hotness trumped all I suppose. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the heat (aka the sex) was great but there was a something missing in the conversation, something I can\u2019t put my finger on exactly, that made me distance myself a bit.I also don\u2019t understand starting a series with a historical and then jumping forward so far for the rest of the books. It seems like you\u2019d be alienating readers that way. Readers like me that don\u2019t enjoy historicals much won\u2019t read the first one and lovers of historical might not embrace the different era. I would think since they jumped into the 21st century with Caressed By Night, there will be no going back. I don\u2019t think the series suffered really, just thought it weird to do.So while I enjoyed the story itself, the connection with the characters was a bit off for me and because of that, the rating suffered a bit.I give Caressed By Night by Amanda J Greene 3.25 stars!"}, {"userName": "VampireNovelFan", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4897902-vampirenovelfan", "userReview": "Starts off strong, but it loses steam\nOne benefit for most vampires is that they usually live pretty darn long. Amanda Greene\u2019s Caressed by Moonlight, Book 1 of the Rulers of Darkness series, was a delightful period novel focusing on vampire Dorian Vlakhos and his human love, Victoria Kingston. Fast-forward a good couple of centuries and though those two are alive and well, Dmitri Arsov and Kerstyn Ingmar are the central characters in this novel.Dmitri, a pure vampire who faked his death hundreds of years ago, has reemerged to take care of unfinished business. Focused on exacting revenge that\u2019s been brewing for centuries against his attempted murderer, things get a little more complicated when he meets Kerstyn, his destined mate. To keep her safe would mean to stay away from her. But that\u2019s impossible, so they have to fight against impending doom.I thought the novel started off strong. Being set in modern times didn\u2019t make it feel quite as dry as its predecessor. I don\u2019t read a lot of series where there\u2019s such a huge time gap, so that was a nice change. I enjoyed Dmitri\u2019s character. He was confident without being too cocky, brutish or annoying. And even with his age he exudes a certain vulnerability, and not just when it comes to Kerstyn. Emo? Maybe a smidge, but it certainly isn\u2019t intolerable.I liked him better than Kerstyn who honestly felt like your typical cookie-cutter heroine in these types of books. She grew up privileged but struggles because her parents didn\u2019t get her any real love. I feel like Greene could have written something a little more dramatic because I didn\u2019t find myself very sympathetic to her situation.The storyline could have been a bit tighter. I was really drawn in towards the beginning, but then they whine about the same issues over and over and I found myself pretty tired of it by the end. It\u2019s not a very long read, but it felt that way after a while.To be honest, the title between these books are way too close. If you read the first one, after hearing the title of the second one you\u2019d probably think you already read the novel, even though the stories are like night and day\u2026or past and present I should say.So all in all it was entertaining, but there wasn\u2019t a whole lot to set it apart from similar novels.*Review also posted to Amazon."}, {"userName": "Shari", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5748445-shari", "userReview": "I have wanted to read this book for months as it has glowing reviews on Goodreads. While it was a full length book, it didn\u2019t take overly long to read. We meet Kerstyn Ingmar as she leaves a club and is rescued by a dark, sexy man. While she is attracted, he bundles her into a cab and sends her home. When arriving home she has an argument with her roommate and is kicked out. No where else to turn too, another friends suggests she stay with someone she knows. That someone is Dimitri, the man who rescued her in the dark alley.Dimitri Arsov is the last remaining pure vampire with a dark secret. He is a seer of the future. Acting on something he has seen, he fakes his death for over 400 years. He is now back to seek revenge and meet his mate\u2026Kerstyn. But Dimitri is haunted by bloody images of the future, but can he change fate?The story seemed to grip me at first with some deep, dark passions that were only surface deep, ready to explode. The love scenes were explosively passionate. While I liked Dimitri, I had a harder time liking Kerstyn.Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed with the book. It wasn\u2019t bad it just had me questioning too many things. Kerstyn is way to na\u00efve. She\u2019s a virgin of course and trusts almost everyone. She moves in with Dimitri without even knowing him. Trustingly she just accepts everything he tells her about vampires, witches and shape shifters. Also in the beginning she seems so young and then starts to be so mature by the middle of the book.The dialog left me feeling a little stilted. It didn\u2019t draw me in as much as I wanted it too. At times it didn\u2019t seem to have a point as well. I can\u2019t quite describe it, but it just didn\u2019t flow for me.The relationship moved extremely fast and had no real conflict. It was way to easy and simple. Kerstyn just falls for Dimitri and nothing he says really stops her for very long. They fall in bed. He tells her he is a vampire. Tries to talk herself out it all, but can\u2019t because she is so drawn to him. It just never seems to get deep or conflicted between them.While there is a glossary at the beginning of the book, I found myself lost at times wondering what was going on. This is the second book in the series, but the first book takes place nearly 200 years in the past. This may be what caused some of my confusion at times.Overall, it was a decent storyline with a very believable world built into it. The more and more we learn of Dimitri\u2019s past make me want to gobble him up, but I lacked the faith the Kerstyn could keep him if she wasn\u2019t his one true mate."}, {"userName": "Natasja", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2568842-natasja", "userReview": "Caressed by Night by Amanda Greene is the second novel in the Rulers of Darkness Series and I have to say it\u2019s another fabulous book. It\u2019s a little different from the first novel, because while Caressed by Moonlight was set the 1800\u2019s, this novel was set in the modern day; but it definitely had the same vibe.The main characters Dimitri Arsov and Kerstyn Ingmar are an amazing couple. Dimitri is one of the first vampires ever made and was thought dead for centuries. Betrayed by his second in command, he had to find a way to reclaim his throne and deal with this traitor. After waiting centuries to sets his trap, he meets beautiful Kerstyn Ingmar and realizes she is the mate he has been waiting for. He knows this will complicate things, but he cannot ignore his destiny.Dimitri is definitely one of the most powerful vampires alive, but he keeps his powers to himself. I love that about a man, yes he is powerful but doesn\u2019t show it unless when it\u2019s absolutely needed. The way he show Kerstyn what he is and how he feels about him is so amazing. Kerstyn in just the right heroine for him, she is smart, curious and definitely not afraid of him. She accepts him just the way he is and nothing less. I love the fact that we saw Dorian, Victoria and Falcon back from the first novel. Those three stole my heart from the first moment and it\u2019s good to see how they doing. I have to say that I see some potential characters who deserve their own book; Silvie who\u2019s Kerstyn best friend and also a witch. Gabriel, who\u2019s an outcaste vampire but has a heart of gold, Gannon and of course Hadrian who\u2019s another ruler and finally decided to take matters into his own hands and start living again.Miss Greene has written another amazing novel with great characters, fabulous storyline and a great world setting. It made me want to be a part of a world, where no normal living being wants to live in.I cannot wait to see who\u2019s going to be in the next novel, I have my wishes; now let\u2019s hope they will come true.I was given this book to read in exchange of a honest review from the author Amanda Greene."}, {"userName": "Lissette", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4008232-lissette", "userReview": "Betrayed by one of his very own, Dimitri Arsov has kept his presence a secret for the past four hundred years.

She is the type of person to put others before herself. Her personality clashes with Dimitri's for dominance and let the seduction begin. Dimitri is the last pureblood vampire left. He has plenty of secrets and even a darker past. He is afraid his darkness will consume him. He seeks to protect those he cares for and has a high sense of honor. I loved book one but this story had something missing. I was a little disappointed with the main story and the relationship between Kerstyn and Dimitri. There was more sex then them actually developing a strong relationship in my opinion. Despite that I loved hearing the secondary characters stories.

Amanda J. Greene has more than delivered with this second installment of the Rulers of Darkness.This book is different from most vampire novels in terms of timing. I\u2019ve always wondered why vampires who often live up to thousands of years always find their soul mates within months of each other. They live forever \u2013 surely that doesn\u2019t make sense?

When I first started reading Caressed by Night, I was surprised to see that it took place in present day since the first book in the series was set in the 1800\u2019s. Amanda Greene has really shown her fantastic writing skills by taking a series that started as a \u201chistorical\u201d vampire romance and flawlessly continued the series with a second book that takes place 200 years later. I was pleased to see that Dorian and Victoria from the first book make an appearance and other characters from their book play a part in this story as well. Dimitri Arsov, King of the Arsov Clan, is an intoxicatingly powerful and sexy vampire. As the last remaining pure-blood, his powers are beyond anyone\u2019s imagination, yet his heart is so fragile and without his mate, Kerstyn, he would be lost. Ms. Greene has a way of writing her vampires that while they are powerful, they have many qualities that make them vulnerable emotionally. Each and every character has their own story to tell, and while the book focuses on Dimitri and Kerstyn, we learn many things about the other characters, vampire history, and get a clear picture of how all these Rulers of Darkness have been linked together in the past and will work together in the future to continue to build this wonderful world that Ms. Greene has created.Caressed by Night is full of sizzling passion, deeply addictive characters, and a storyline that refuses to leave you long after the story ends. There is so much left to tell in this series I simply can\u2019t wait to see what Amanda Greene has next in store for all these sexy Rulers of Darkness."}, {"userName": "Rachel V.", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7429855-rachel-v", "userReview": "This is the second book in the series and it was a good follow up to the first. I will say that I think Dorian from the first book is still my favorite so far but I did like Dimitri. I can\u2019t wait for the next book to see what is in store for Hadrian the mad king.Dimitri is supposed to be over 10,000 years old and the first of his kind along with three others who are now dead. He is the original pure blood but as was not the case of the other three Dimitri\u2019s heart is also pure.I do love how the author was able to match up Kerstyn and Dimitri. They are both lost souls who need someone to love and treasure them as they have never really gotten that. The author does have a unique was of bringing her characters to life with all their little quirks. The latter part and ending of this story did surprise me as I was not expecting the twist that the author has in this story. However I believe that it is fitting and does tie up the novel very well.Kerstyn works in a museum over the new Viking wing. If there was ever another place I would like to be other than a library it is a museum of ancient history. I enjoy both and could really relate to the main character in her excitement over her job.I am giving this book four stars not because I like the book any less than the last one but it just didn\u2019t suck me in quite as much as the first one. I believe it to possibly be that I just would rather hang around Dorian and Victoria more that Dimitri and Kerstyn although I really like the name Dimitri. Perhaps they will grow on me more. I don\u2019t completely know but nevertheless I still really enjoyed this story and look forward to continuing this series.*I received this book free from author in a contest. It in no way affected by honest opinion of the book."}, {"userName": "Wendy-Book Lovers 4Ever", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3149873-wendy-book-lovers-4ever", "userReview": "All review can be found also on my blog at http://vampireswerewolvesfairiesohmy....My Rating: 4.5This story takes place in the present, 150+ years after the first book. Dimitri, one of the original vampire kings, faked his own death over 400 years ago. He did this to help the other vampire kings find their true mates. When Dimitri was turned vampire, he was also cursed by a Shaw witch, a peaceful witch tribe until they are threatened. With the curse he now has visions of the future so he knew what he was doing was for the best of all vampirekind if not for the best for himself. Dimitri knew who his mate was, now he just has to find her and make her his no matter the risks. Living in Las Vegas was just a temporary thing for Kerstyn, she wanted to live in New York and work at a famous museum. With a little help from a Shaw witch, who happens to be her close friend also, she meets Dimitri just when she needed him the most. Getting kicked out of her apartment and needing a job are the two worst things going to Kerstyn right now so when she is offered a free place to live and a fantastic job all due to Dimitri she jumps on both, it also doesn't hurt that he is the most beautiful man she has ever met and he is attracted to her. Dimitri has his personal life working out with Kerstyn. Now he can concentrate on getting his clan back from his second in command who \"killed\" him all those years ago. Bringing his enemy to Vegas is easier than he thought it would be and seeing the future helps, but when it comes to his own future he can't see things clearly. Kerstyn's future is clear to him, he sees her die and does whatever he can to save her but when the time comes and she dies anyway, what happens next is something none of them expected."}, {"userName": "Michelle ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4253940-michelle", "userReview": "I really enjoyed the first book, Caressed by Moonlight, and this book was just as good. I liked Dorian from book 1 and i'm not going to lie- I wanted this book to be about him too. I pouted for a good 10-15 pages when I was first reading about Dimitri. But then I started to get into his story and I started liking him, a lot. Dimitri is constantly waging an inner battle. I felt so bad for him, he could never just let go and be in the moment. Kerstyn was really good for him. She tried to help him let go. I liked that balance between the two of them. They had a good dynamic and it was really easy for me to root for the two of them. I will say this- Kerstyn sure is trusting. To the point of being a little too trusting. I also didn't really like that this was her very first boyfriend ever. It made it seem like she was holding on at times just because there was no one else, because she hadn't experienced this before. Now, that is not to say that I don't like the two of them as a couple. I do, I think they work really well together, I just almost wish that Kerstyn had a little bit more of a backstory. I'm not even sure why, I just kept thinking that while I was reading. I loved that Dimitri had a few secrets up his sleeve and as the story went on you could see layer after layer being peeled back. I loved learning his secrets. I especially loved the history on how vampires came about. I thought that was an awesome story! All in all, this is a really good book. It picks up almost 200 years after the first book left off, and even though I didn't want it to be about a different character at first, I ended up really enjoying Dimitri's story. I became very attached to him and I think I might even like him more than Dorian now. Great series."}], "description": "Dimitri Arsov, the last remaining pure vampire, was thought to be dead for the past four hundred years.
