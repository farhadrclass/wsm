We weren't disappointed. This story was fun from the first page to the last. Written like a mystery but not a 'serious' one; you can ask your child to follow the clues along with the monkey.

Everything about this book screams Summer!, though it wasn't released until October (what's up with that, Lerner?). From the seaside location to the bright orange cover, the whole thing will have you hearing luau music in your head. Chico Bon Bon is called away from his normal routine of fixing things when his friend Clark the elephant sends him a postcard (I love the address: Chico Bon Bon, Big Tree House, Next to Elsa's) asking for his help. Clark's uncle's resort is falling apart and they need Chico and his trusty tool belt to help it from being destroyed completely. First we get an amazing two page spread of Chico's road trip, then a wonderfully colorful and detailed spread of the resort itself. If there's one thing Monroe is really good at, it's the little details. Chico gets right to work fixing things and trying to solve the mystery of why they're breaking in the first place. First it's a hole in a cabana roof, and then it's chewed up ropes on all the hammocks. Eventually, Chico does catch the saboteur in the act, and it both is and isn't anything you'd expect. All's well that ends well, and Chico and Clark finally get to go surfing. With each new installment, I'm growing more and more fond of little Chico. He's resourceful, helpful, and not above taking a banana break in the middle of a mission. Monroe's sense of humor and again, her eye for detail are in top form here. I only wish I'd had this book during the dog days. Oh well, there's always next summer!"}, {"userName": "Terri", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1578420-terri", "userReview": "The \"Monkey with a Tool Belt\" series is filled with such fun, unique ideas. Chico the monkey carries his tool belt, filled with things like wham hammers, goo, sploshers, and half-inch loosey loos, with him everywhere. He is called upon by his friends for help fixing things. This time his friend Clark asks him to come to his uncle's seaside resort to repair things that are mysteriously breaking. Fun illustrations filled with lots of tiny details which are fun to explore, probably make this picture book a bit more appropriate for school age kids. Minnesota author, Chris Monroe, delivers another very fun, readable addition to the series."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1797711-karen", "userReview": "Very cute and appealing to the 7 and 8 year old set - I know because one read it with me and was enthralled and completely tickled with Chico Bon Bon's detailed tool belt.
