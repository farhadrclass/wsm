If you are a \u201cHappy ever after,\u201d type person then this book is not for you. Mr. Rosamila always surprises me with his wit and talent. \u201cThis is the end is easily the shortest story I have ever read, yet it is brimming with impact. Unsurpassed by a full length novel. Well done Mr. Rosamillia.Zelebrity Money = Ron and Aunt Maggie has built a fortress in the abandoned trailer park,Aunt Maggie has a Zeleberty chained up out back, Ron is offered a lot of money for his Aunt\u2019s fine specimen, but she will not part with him. She believes someone somewhere will find the secret to taming the zombies. She has faith that someday he will join her on the sofa to watch his old movies with her. Zombies,Dogs and Old Bones A short, yet cute story about a man, his wife, and their dog reunion.Fist Settlement This story gives as good as any plausible explanation for the mysterious word scrawled all over a small town in 1589.The word being Croatan.Manhattan is a _______Island. Buddy has been living off of ketchup packets, held up in a little shop. He crosses paths with a skinhead named Kevin, who tells him about his brothers and a skirmish between them and the dead at the Hudson saying his brothers will be along shortly. Well Buddy is not sure what to make of this man. Is he friend or foe?It just goes to show you should never judge a book by it\u2019s cover. Kevin and Buddy decide to head out for Bleeker Bill\u2019s restaurant where Kevin said there is still good food to be eaten.Southern Barbeque Jesse didn\u2019t notice gun shots when he stopped in at Bunnell\u2019s Meat Market. He didn\u2019t notice the burning train on the tracks. He was dreaming of the food and friends that would be feasted on at their little barbeque while listening to a Garth brook song. He did begin to notice there was no attendant at the meat counter nor at the check out counter. So he just put the money he figured his goods cost on the counter. Trail of the Undead Jim Frost was protecting the trail with Billy Boone an old friend. There was a couple (Eric & Mary Fries) walking up the trail so Jim pointed his Remington at them and told them to stop!The man told the two men they were in trouble and needed help, that the place they had come from Pembroke in Giles county was overrun. They were hiking when the dead started tearing apart the living and they were slowly making their way up the trail.What the couple didn\u2019t know was that these two men Jim & Billy were men on the run and the couple would find no help there.Swim Out Past the Breakers Mike was on the water with his board. He had been out there for three hours. He could see the Florida beaches were burning and he had the dead keeping pace with him and the horde on congregating on the beach waiting for his return. Blind In Texas Billy Rice worked on a oil rig. When the explosion happened despite him wearing a harness, the was shot 100 feet in the opposite direction.He was tossed inside the ditch that the men called \u201cThe piss pit.\u201dThe impact had done some major damage he determined hours later when he had come to. he had a broken arm, either fractured both kneecaps or they were just badly bruised. While taken inventory of his injuries he discovered he couldn\u2019t see.He could still smell the fire burning oil, and could feel ash floating down on him.His buddy Mack talked him and told him to be quiet, that the dead were killing the living and then joining the rank of the undead. Mack told him they had to get to Billy\u2019s truck because his truck was on fire. Mack would have to fireman carry his big friend. Billy was sure this blindness was a temporary thing or at least he hoped it was. Caution Smoke Ahead Cheyenne Leone received a call from her daughter Robin out of the blue. She hadn\u2019t spoken to her since her ex husband had taken her away 15 years ago and married Cheyenne\u2019s cousin Marie .Why was she calling her now? It seems the world has gone to hell and her daughter needs Cheyenne to come and get her. Her seemingly perfect life had taken a real nose dive after Marie had hurt her father. In the big house with a pool and other nice things. This is the end Harry was on the roof of his house holding his gun when he heard a voice saying it was the end. This had been going on for three years. He wasn\u2019t use to hearing a voice so when his brother Joe who he hadn\u2019t seen him in years. Joe had invited Harry to join him and others for a feast. Harry was the last of his kind. For such a short story it sure did drive the realization home. Sometimes more is not better. Sanctuary Keith was a good guy and had every right to be put out by a punck ass kid Danny, his useless mother Irene,wasn\u2019t going to stop her son from being a greedy smart mouthed punk. After all Keith had taken them in given them shelter and when he tells Danny, that is the last pack of double A batteries and that they need them for one of the radios , the punk Danny with his attitude said \u201cYeah? There is nobody out there so what difference does it make?\u201das he proceeds to put the batteries in his walkmen. Irene doesn\u2019t like it when Keith corrects the boy , yet she has no desire to do it herself. Keith wouldn\u2019t mind starting something with Irene to see where it leads if only he had the chance to be alone with her. The teen, is a real nuisance. This was just one of the many things Danny did to get his digs in on Keith, knowing his mother would step in and stop Keith from taking matters into his own hand. I have to say the character of Keith was a lot more tolerant than I would be in the same situation."}, {"userName": "Joan", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6049365-joan", "userReview": "What a collection of flawless and humourous zombies tales from the brilliant mind of Rosamilia. These shorts are filled with some horrific ideas while you just know his tongue was firmly embedded in his cheek. I highly recommend this book if you love the zombie genre with a dab here and there of humour."}, {"userName": "Jade Lopert", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/440863-jade-lopert", "userReview": "Solid and fun short collection of zombie stories. I'm not sure anything is exactly reinventing the wheel here, but that might partially be because I'm a little burnt out on zombies still. It's a little bit of a mixed bag for me here.By story:Zelebrity Money:There's a zombie caged in the backyard and he's famous. What do you do when someone offers you a ton of money for him, but your aunt doesn't want him to go anywhere? Good start to the collection. 3/5Zombies, Dogs and Old Bones:Eh. It was kind of sweet in a way. Kind of the story of an aging couple and their dog. 2/5First Settlement:Yet another version of what happened to the Roanoke Settlement. Zombies this time obviously. At least it's flash fiction. 1/5Manhattan is a @#$%^&* Island:What happens when you're trapped with zombies and skinheads with water all around the bridges destroyed? Mostly you pretty much starve to death. 3/5Southern Barbeque:If you ever wandered what those people who get zombified right off the bat with no awareness of what's happening were thinking. 4/5Trail of the Undead:The biggest take away here for me was finding some quality horror flash fiction. I have mixed experiences with flash fiction. 4/5Swim Out Past the BreakersZombie apocalypse happening? Why not take the day off to go surfing? What could go wrong? 4/5Blind In Texas:This was probably my favorite, because it's told from the unique perspective of someone who is not only extremely hurt, but blind and can't see what's happening. 4/5Caution, Smoke Ahead:I..........didn't like this one. I don't think everyone should write what they know, but it bothers me when addicts are written like bad cliches from 80s movies. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 2/5This Is The End:Another excellent flash fiction. 4/5Sactuary:I guess douche bags deserve to have their tales of the zombie apocalypse written too. Unfortunately when they're so unlikable and super objectifying of women, it's not so awesome to read about. (Also, every time batteries for an iPod were mentioned it pulled me out of the story, because, well, iPods don't use batteries. Never have.) 1/5Why I Write About Zombies:Blog post/essay about why the author writes about zombies. I'm always interested in why authors are interested in what they are so 5/5.\"Dying Days\" extreme zombie novella PreviewAside from weird gratuitous tits in the first two pages, I enjoyed this quite a bit. It seemed long for a novella preview though so it makes me wonder how much longer the actual novella is."}, {"userName": "Vix", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7521915-vix", "userReview": "Zelebrity Money: Ron and his Aunty have an unusual yard guest, he used to be an actor don\u2019t ya know! The fact that he is a zombie is not that unusual in this trailer park. But Ron needs to eat, he needs a pay check. Cleverly done with a great sense of tongue in cheek.Zombies, Dogs and Old Bones: I nearly coughed up a lung laughing about the zombie from the Thriller video A sad little love story about Sue & John and how Gidget their dog reunites them. First Settlement: short and sharp. AR gives a whole new version of how the west was won.Manhatten\u2026.: Buddy & Kevin are trying to survive, there is a nasty undertone to this story, yet it has some random and clever movie and music references.Southern BBQ: Jessie is having a family cook out, he is in such a rush that he fails to notice the zompoc around him. Funny in sad way.Trail of the Undead: wow this one was so fast, furious and nasty.Swim Out Past the Breakers: so not worth taking a day off work to surf during the start of the zompoc! Not sure how AR manages to make gross so funny.Blind in Texas: OMG! What could be worse than the zompoc? How about being injured and blinded at the start\u2026 horrific little tale that gave me the shudders.Caution, Smoke Ahead: Cheyenne finally gets a second chance with her 15yr estranged daughter. But it\u2019s not the zompoc that has ruined it but her own drug addled past. AR has perfectly captured the incredulity that you get when someone you expect to fail without you does exceptionally well. I wasn\u2019t sure if to laugh or cry.This is the End: Harry is cut off and forced to eat only asparagus. What could be worse? Seeing y our brother who owes you money after 5yrs. Another slap around the face from AR.Sanctuary: Keith has a plan but he didn\u2019t count on the thong! Good little insight into a cramped space and lot of lust. So wanted this one to carry on.Interesting bit about why AR writes about zombies and how his hero is\u2026 so much so I have now bought The Rising by Brian Keene, if he gets excited about a book, it must be good. Nice chunk of Dying Days at the end."}, {"userName": "Blaise", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5333200-blaise", "userReview": "Rosamilia writes a fine zombie. What I have discovered about zombies is that they strip away motive, intrigue, desire, and social mores. They reveal people for what they really are when in survival mode. Gone are the days where it was always heroes, now we get to see what would REALLY happen. I'm beginning to like them."}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37690606-kelly", "userReview": "A fun collection of zombie short stories!To read more, go here: Zombie Tea Party"}, {"userName": "Frank", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3983118-frank", "userReview": "This was a fun little throwback read. I have to chuckle when I say that becsusr as of this review, this collection of short zombie fiction is only six years old. But it harkens back to the point where I was reading mounds of indie zombie fiction.Of all that zombie fiction, Armand Rosamilia's always stood out to me. It was simple, clean and held a certain charm among all the gore and sinew. This collection is also appealing in that it presents short, bite-sized zombie vinettes, also a trademark of the genre all those years ago.So maybe you're like me and this has been sitting on your ereader forever. You need to open it up and take that stroll down memory lane to a simpler time. A time when the zombies still bit and the ladies still wore thongs.
