Take my 3 -star rating lightly, because it does not even begin to sum up everything I felt about this different, imaginative, weird romance.I call it a \"romance\" out of the human need to categorize, but it truly doesn't sit well in any genre. It has paranormal and sci-fi elements, as well as what feels like touches of magical realism - all blended together around a complex love story with diverse characters. Let me emphasize that once more - The Love That Split the World is a book rich with diversity, feminism, sex-positivism and just good old beautiful writing. The author chooses her words carefully, painting a gorgeous and vivid picture of both the Kentucky setting and this delicate time in Natalie Cleary's life.Brimming with Native American stories, culture and mythology, the book whizzes along with a magical energy. It is full of many short stories (and through them - life lessons) told by the mysterious \"Grandmother\" who sometimes visits Natalie at night. Who is Grandmother? A Native American messenger? A religious apparition? Or merely a figment of Natalie's imagination? Only time will tell.Natalie is a particularly likable and wise character; she is quick to point out slut-shaming and refuses to see her ex's new girlfriend as her enemy or, indeed, anything other than a human being. On top of this, her mental state plays a large part in this book, asking a question I have personally always loved - supernatural or psychological?Fantasy and psychology live side by side here, prompting the reader to constantly wonder just what is real and what is imagined. Given my 3-star rating, you've probably been waiting for it and here it is - the BUT. Well... this book might be a great many things, but it is first and foremost a romance and relies on your attachment to said romance to effectively tell the story. And it breaks my first two rules of writing romance novels.1) Instalove. Like wow, bang, whoosh, I just met you and this is crazy, but let me talk about your beautiful eyelashes kind of instalove. Romances where emotions are plucked out of midair and built upon gorgeous looks just leave me feeling so cold.2) You so pretty. Sentences that become paragraphs that become pages about how Beau is a physical work of art.\n\"His biceps are roughly the size of my head, and his eyes look like summer incarnate, and he has two little dark freckles on the side of his nose, and a mouth that somehow manages to look like a shy kid\u2019s one minute and a virile Greek god\u2019s the next.\u201d\n*snores* I just don't care that much about beautiful people. And I especially don't need to be reminded over and over again how good-looking they are.If you can look past the instalove and eye roll-worthy romance moments, then this really is a beautiful book. Unfortunately, so much rests on the romance that it's quite hard to do.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Pinterest"}, {"userName": "Khanh, first of her name, mother of bunnies", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4527753-khanh-first-of-her-name-mother-of-bunnies", "userReview": "\u201cSometimes the most beautiful moments in our lives are things that hurt badly at the time. We only see them for what they really were when we stand at the very end and look back.\u201d\nI have to be honest, from the title, I didn't expect much of this book. I was wrong, and I love it when I'm wrong in moments like this. This was a wonderfully-written, introspective book of surprising depth.\nGod is a thing I think I see in glimmers all over: an enormous and vague warmth I sometimes catch pulsing around me, giving me shivers and making tears prick my eyes; a mysterious and limitless Thing threaded through all the world and refusing to be reduced to a name or a set of rules and instead winding itself through millions of stories, true and made up, connecting all breathing things.\nThis book has diversity (for example, the main character is dark-skinned Native American) and feminism, two traits that are incredibly rare in YA literature. I think it would fit into the magical realism genre, which is surprising, since I tend to think of that entire genre as hippie-dippie bullshit.I'm not Native American, and I can't pretend to judge the veracity of the short tales and myths presented in this book; all I know is that the writing is beautiful and the legends are respectfully presented.The main character is great. She's strong without being bitchy. She's not judgmental and she is thoughtful without seeming to be unrealisticly perfect.\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I fell in love with Matt Kincaid,\u201d Megan says quietly.It\u2019s like a dagger in my heart. Not jealousy, at least not toward Megan. If anything, I\u2019m jealous that she loves Matt but doesn\u2019t even know me. And I\u2019m jealous that this Megan would tell me about things mine never has. I wonder when her feelings for him went away, if they even did, and how I didn\u2019t notice them.Had I been hurting her, hurting both of them, for the last six years over something it turns out I\u2019d never been sure I wanted?\nSo from what I've said, this book is pretty great, right? Well, no. First, it is suuuuuuuuuuuuper slow. The writing is beautiful, but there are entire paragraphs written about one concept, and so the book feels overly verbose. Furthermore, the romance can get too much at times. It didn't feel that way because again, the writing is wonderful, but it can get distracting.But overall, this was a much better book than the title indicates."}, {"userName": "Raeleen Lemay", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3452652-raeleen-lemay", "userReview": "My video review is up! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs109...1.5/5The only reason I'm bumping this up by a half star is because I really liked the main character (Natalie)'s humor throughout the first half of the book. Other than that, I didn't like ANYTHING about this book.My main problem is that I feel like Emily Henry tried way too hard to incorporate as many elements in this book as she possibly could. This book involves time travel, parallel worlds, adoption, Native American history/stories, insta-love (ew), mental health, psychology, and in my opinion, she didn't do it well. There were too many things going on for any of them to be fully fleshed out, and for that reason, the story/plot/characters were constantly all over the place. She also tried really hard to wedge in an LGBT aspect, but did it in such an obvious and not-normal way (literally in the middle of a huge rant about psychology a character just goes, \"oh yeah, and I'm totally gay. k back to psychology...\") so that on top of Natalie going on a page-long rant about feminism (and then never mentioning it again) got on my nerves. It was like Henry just wanted to cover her bases and be as inclusive as possible, but it just came across very insincere and forced. There was also the problem of INFO DUMPING. SO MUCH INFO DUMPING. Henry had her characters go on huge rants and long, drawn-out explanations about what was going on. It was very tiresome to read, and I was constantly struggling with the decision to continue or just give up on the book. Lastly, the characters. There was no development at all throughout the book, so by the end of the book I felt like I still didn't really know them at all. I didn't feel like any of the characters were real people, and so of course I didn't feel anything for them.I also read an article (https://storify.com/Debbie_Reese/a-na...) that points out how problematic Natalie's adoption was in terms of her being Native, and that made me like the book even less once I started thinking about it more. I was going to give it a 2-star rating, but that was the nail in the coffin for me."}, {"userName": "Lola  Reviewer", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14596170-lola-reviewer", "userReview": "''How tired do you feel right now?''''Like I haven\u2019t slept for four days, and someone just stabbed a shot of adrenaline into my heart.''''That\u2019s how I feel when I\u2019m at home, miles away, and I think about you.''\nI wanted to display a cutesy quote I randomly picked from thousands of similar written ones, because everlasting romance as well as the whole concept of \u2018soul mates\u2019 are the main themes in this story. Believe me, THE WORLD THAT SPLIT THE WORLD is made of 90% lovey-dovey scenes or ones that lead to them. It doesn\u2019t matter where you are in the story; Beau is practically always there with Natalie, almost like a shadow.While I did want to read something that will warm my heart (especially at this time of year), I really didn\u2019t want a quintessential young adult romance. This may come as a surprise, after all the heroine does travel through time and \u2018worlds\u2019, but there is no originality in the romantic aspects of things. On top of that, if you\u2019re like me, you want the first encounter between the main character and the love-interest to be special\u2026 Well, without any intentions of ruining this for you, I must tell you that the very-special-first-encounter scene leads to the dreadful insta-love.So the romance is a downer, but this book does have decent redeemable qualities. For instance, we have diverse characters that have the blood of the First Peoples flowing through their bodies! I thought it was pretty interesting for the author to introduce us to such untypical characters because of how they enriched the story with normally unseen elements such as storytelling. I really did enjoy it whenever Natalie\u2019s grandmother would try to illuminate her granddaughter\u2019s mind and show her different ways of seeing the world with the telling of legends. I was also enchanted by the writing style. Emily Henry\u2019s metaphors are ones that actually make sense, compared to what I\u2019ve read lately, and she doesn\u2019t shy away from using an ever-present amount of adjectives and adverbs. You\u2019ll see, her writing feels alive. The only thing that waned my excitement from time to time was the dialogs. I understand that it\u2019s natural for contemporary characters to use colloquial English when interacting with each other, but what I found is that the intensity of the atmosphere would fall drastically when they would start using words like \u2018bitch\u2019, \u2018fucking\u2019, or even ones like \u2018awesome.\u2019 But, at the same time, this is a subjective thing, because I personally just really like when authors replace those types of words with less common ones.Eventually, you\u2019ll realize, when reading the story, that even though Natalie can travel through time, is looking for her mom and grandmother, tries to push her ex away from her life and is trying to figure out what she wants for her future, all of these things\u2019 importance shrinks to the size of grain of sand when Beau is around. Sure, they often have in mind to figure out how the time-traveling works and what it implies, but eventually they sort come to just accept it\u2026 Honestly, the way it\u2019s explained at the end will probably not clarify it all, so it also asks for your blind faith in what is not possible. The only reason I\u2019m saying this is so you don\u2019t expect this to be something it\u2019s not.THE LOVE THAT SPLIT THE WORLD is worth reading, but I\u2019m strongly suggesting you do not overestimate its value."}, {"userName": "Jeff Zentner", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/129306-jeff-zentner", "userReview": "I just finished this and I'm exhausted in the way of people who are exhausted from a perfect day of standing in the ocean and riding roller coasters.

(Picture me gently clinking a knife on the side of a wine glass, or whatever that classy thing is people do before they give toasts at swanky dinner parties.)Hello, everyone. If I could get your attention. I just want to say a few words.So you all know Emily, yes? Emily Henry? The writer of this very book?I only \u201cmet\u201d Emily for the first time in June of last year, when I read her book  A Million Junes. And as soon as I picked it up, I knew. It wasn\u2019t just the pretty cover or the compelling synopsis - it was deeper than that. This was love.But, you know, I thought I\u2019d known before, so I waited it out. I finished the book before I made any announcements. And it was just as I had thought and hoped and dreamed it would be: a beautiful, truthful magical realism with wonderful, funny characters, strong female friendship, a happy family, a charming romance that didn\u2019t take over the narrative, and above all, perhaps the loveliest writing style I\u2019d ever encountered in YA. I was hooked.Love at first sight turned out to be true love. <3 <3 <3Still, love is a bumpy road. So I waited six months to be sure before I picked up her first book. With a pretty low average rating, complaints of a slow plot and instalove, I knew this would be the ultimate test of my affections. I entered with trepidation.From the start, I should have known I needn\u2019t have worried. It was another gorgeous cover, another compelling synopsis. As I began reading, I discovered the same wonderful magical realism, sense of humor, full and lovable characters, friendships, and that irresistible writing that had made me fall in love in the first place.The romance was a little much comparatively, it\u2019s true, but who has time to be bothered by love being laid on a little thick when there\u2019s time travel and parallel universes and Native American folklore and coming of age and the most nostalgic, caring depiction of the end of high school I\u2019ve ever read? I guess The Love That Split the World isn\u2019t for everyone, but it is for me. Looks like it\u2019s a question that split the world! I kid, I kid.In short, Emily Henry, I loved your second, underrated-but-acclaimed book, and I loved your underloved debut. I love the brilliantly done magical realism, the banter, the characters, the friendships and family relationships that aren\u2019t left by the wayside, the realness of the emotions, and above all, the gorgeous writing. So\u2026(picture me getting on one knee here, or something)...Emily, I have a very important question to ask you:Will you be the only YA author on my all time favorite authors list?(Here is either where I\u2019ll insert a SHE SAID YES!!! Or just leave this parenthetical here in the event that she doesn\u2019t respond. I have to be honest with myself and say it\u2019s probably going to be the latter.)Bottom line: Apparently this book isn\u2019t for everyone. BUT DON\u2019T YOU EVER COME INTO THIS HOUSE AND INSULT MY WIFE FAVORITE YA AUTHOR.--------------PRE-REVIEWA series of things of which I am totally convinced:- This book is achingly lovely.- I want to squeeze every character in it (in a loving way).- Everyone, straight up everyone, should read this (but only after reading A Million Junes)- Emily Henry sees the world differently from all of us, quite possibly in the best way possible, and I want to crack her head open and live inside it but only after I give her a big hug and perhaps a kiss on the forehead.More of a review to come"}, {"userName": "Aimee \u2665 | Aimee, Always", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5478965-aimee-aimee-always", "userReview": "7 Emotions The Love That Split the World Will Make You Feel1. \n  Suspicion\n - This book has a pretty unique, fantastical, kick-ass plot that'll make your head go crazy trying to dispatcher what's real and what isn't. It's more of a magical realism novel of sorts, with a hint of mystery thrown in for good measure.2. \n  Boredom\n - Okay, can we please talk about the info-dumps? Because Holy Grandmother, this book is FULL of them. You're going to get huge chunks of science-y (in which my brain would like to explode)/medical/story information in a single go, and if you have a short attention span like me, you may or may not fall asleep.3. \n  (Possibly) Indifferent\n - The writing's really conversational and easy to read in this one, but personally it sounded like it was trying a bit too hard to sound natural and funny. The humor was COMPLETELY lost on me. But there were lots of lovely quotable quotes if you're into that kind of thing.4. \n  Pride\n - Our heroine Natalie is a Native American who's open-minded, is against slut-shaming and is generally what a female lead should be. She's realistic, and isn't that \"special snowflake\" character we all know and love and want to strangle.5. \n  Frustration\n - Because the instalove here is just a big no-no. And also I can't stand it when the heroines let their love lives consume all their time, and that's basically what happened here. OH, and their relationship is just so full of I want yous... And for me, the phrase turns into I want to puke.6. \n  Love\n - The family love in this novel just makes you want to give out lots of Xs and Os and asdfghjkls. It has the kind of family where you just want to join everyone in one, big, adoptive group hug! (Especially near the end--the family dynamics there definitely made me cry!)7. \n  Confusion and/or Mixed Feelings\n - Because that ending. Eurgh. I stil dont know how to feel about it. It was both brilliant and shitty at the same time.Edit: Actual rating is 2.5 stars.Blog | I Adork YouTwitter | @aimeereadsInstagram | @aimeereadsPinterest | aimeereads"}, {"userName": "Maureen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10762033-maureen", "userReview": "Well that was interesting. It got better toward the end so it *may* be a 2.5. Maybe.While the writing was beautiful (at times) and the story was pretty unique, this book didn't really do it for me.It felt like it was trying to be too many things at once and not really solidly succeeding at any of them. I really liked the positive elements of feminism, emotional health, etc HOWEVER many of those things felt thrown into the book at the last minute (or maybe were just too in your face) and weren't really woven into the story. There was some major insta love (and you know how I feel about insta love) with not a lot of character development until MUCH later in the book, so everything felt really rushed.Pretty much the whole book I was confused, and even when things were revealed and made known I was STILL confused. I'm honestly still not sure I understood any of it. Maybe because there were so many psychology and sci-fi info dumps something went over my head because seriously. There were PAGES of explanation of things. Pages.Overall, didn't really like this, though it was an addicting read with a beautiful end, it was lacking a plot I could follow and a solid grasp on what kind of book it wanted to be."}, {"userName": "Jillian (bookishandnerdy)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3101094-jillian-bookishandnerdy", "userReview": "I also posted a video review on my booktube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVoRj...\n\"I want you to understand something, Natalie.

It has many poignant passages about life and love and growing up and if any of these strikes a personal chord with you then it's very likely that you will love this book.The parts of this story that I connected with the most were the atmospheric southern small town setting, and the many quotes that perfectly nailed that bittersweet feeling of looking back on lost first love.However, there were SO many hard hitting quotes about SO many topics that most of the time this book came off as preachy to me. It was trying so hard to impart life lessons that the story got lost.Another thing I liked about the book was that the main character is Native American and her culture is pretty well represented. (Update: Probably not.) She's been adopted and is on a journey to find out her personal history and there are many folktales scattered throughout the book. The tales were lovely but, again, they occurred so often that it took away from the overall plot. The stories were supposed to contain clues about the plot and although they did help the character Natalie piece things together, I felt the reader could have really done without them. Despite being beautiful and one of my favorite things about this book, they weren't very functional. Every time they popped up in the story I could hear the shrill sound of the plot screeching to a stop.Another plot-stopper was the frequency of scientific info-dumps. 50% of the book is high school partying, drinking, making out, and general teenage confusion and the other 50% an adult character shows up and starts info dumping. Now look, I've said before and I will say it again that I am a fan of a good old fashioned info dump. I like to know what exactly I'm getting into. The problem here is that they came too late and didn't pertain to the plot, but to various types of therapy techniques. By the time the characters were figuring out what was happening to Natalie and the infodumps switched to trying to explain actual time travel, I felt like it was yet another interruption of the pacing. I'd figured it out long before and have seen/read enough time travel plots to not need it spelled out so slowly. Plot-stopper number (what number are we on?) were the amount of memory flashbacks, or just plain stopping in the middle of an interaction to tell the tale of every paint color the walls in a room have been throughout all of time, or where every single piece of furniture in the room came from. And that's not even the time travel aspect coming into play, those are just excessive descriptions.Here's another: The character Matt. He's the former love interest. While I loved all the quotes about first love that his character allowed the story to wax poetic about, he really didn't have much purpose to the story. There's a whole storyline with him that comes to mean NOTHING. He's really only there to give Natalie something to whine about every 5 pages, creating this weird love triangle that didn't need to be there. He could have been in the beginning of the book enough for us to get their history and then peaced out. On the other hand, Matt and the coming of age story could have stayed and the whole time travel premise could have been left out and you'd hardly even know it was missing. Basically what I'm saying is this book felt like an \"everything and the kitchen sink\" kind of story. If you take out all the things that weren't necessary, you'd be left with maybe a 100 page book.Oh, and another thing? There was some shady behavior happening here in which Natalie kept being assaulted and then DEFENDING and APOLOGIZING to her attacker. Because something tragic happens to him, this is ok?? NAH. Not enough of a redemption arc here for that. Also, I'm not super okay with what was asked of Natalie in the end. And I'm not buying the actual ending. Noooooope. Nope. Too neat. If you are picking this up because you wanted a time travel story, read the first chapter and then skip to chapter 31.A better reason to pick this up would be because you want an admittedly cute contemporary love story whose crazy cousin named Time Travel gets drunk and shows up from time to time to spice things up before quickly passing out. The reading experience was kind of like getting in the car with someone and expecting to go to their house. Then you realize they are taking the wrong route to get there so you must be headed someplace else. Once you finally see a building in the distance and figure 'oh hey, there's the movie theater. That must be where we're headed', suddenly you end up half way across the world in a gas station bathroom with no clothes and no idea how you got there.Overall, there are many merits to this book but to be pitched as time travel, there wasn't enough time travel for me. But if you really love character driven stories where you will get to know every (and I mean EVERY) detail of the characters' lives, plus the history of their furniture (I am not kidding, see page 282) then Ayyyyy, this is your type of book! I just wasn't in the mood for that at this time based on what I was expecting and unfortunately it spoiled the fun for me."}, {"userName": "Polly", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33814859-polly", "userReview": "I L O V E T H I S B O O K S O M U C HI had been anticipating this book for quite a while after seeing so many good things about it especially from my friend Summer and it definitely didn't disappoint. If anything it actually exceeded my expectations. What did I love about it? Well even from the first few pages I felt a real connection to this story. I absolutely love that feeling, when you start a book and you just know from the beginning you're going to love it. Well this was that book for me, I was hooked. I felt a connection to Natalie instantly - she jumped right off the page and I felt like we would be BFFs straight away. I love that we were on this crazy journey and experiencing & uncovering everything at the same time as Natalie and I think that was another reason I felt so immersed in her story. What else did I love? I know it might seem a clich\u00e9 thing to say but HONESTLY this book is unlike anything I have ever read before. It's such a strange, beautiful mixture of contemporary, sci-fi and mystery and I love that this book doesn't and *shouldn't* fit into any specific genre or age group. I really do think it's a book that anyone could enjoy, whatever type of book you're usually interested in. Emily Henry is such an amazing storyteller and this plot is so imaginative and creative & completely blew me away. The way the plot developed and the way everything was eventually unraveled was not like anything I could have imagined. I was feeling so many feels by the end that I had to put the book down for a moment and catch my breath. I already mentioned how connected I felt to Natalie's character but really all of the characters were so well developed. I absolutely adored Natalie's family - her parents and siblings were so real and like with Natalie jumped off the page and straight into my heart. And of course I was completely in love with Beau and his and Natalie's love story. I really felt how much these two were connected and how much they were meant to be together. Some more things I love about this book - I love the way Native American folklore and culture was not just included but was a vital part of the storyline. I love how deep and powerful this story was while still having so much humour and heart behind it. I love the way that psychology was touched on - I studied it at school and the way it was featured in the plot just fascinated me. I love the friendship between Natalie & Megan, they was so adorable together. I love how profound the message of self discovery was within the story. I LOVE HOW I STILL CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT THIS BOOK. I could keep on gushing about how much I loved this for a long time but I'll stop now. As you can tell I don't have a bad thing to say about this very special book.

On the first few pages we are introduced to a key character, Grandmother, when Natalie wakes up to realize she\u2019s finally back, someone who has been appearing to Natalie throughout the years. And she comes with an important message \"Three months to save him\" But who is Grandmother? What is Grandmother? You might be wondering. And more importantly, who\u2019s him?

If feels important, but even though I\u2019m so sure this is a dream, I feel a little shy and embarrassed, like I won\u2019t know what to say when I get down there.\u201d\nI love that this story tantalizes you and invites you to keep guessing along our main character, it is suspense and romance driven alike. After Grandmother is gone once again, Natalie stars experiencing sudden changes in space and time, she is standing in a hallway full of students in a moment and in the next everyone disappears.I think after reading this, Natalie Cleary has a special spot on my favorite female leads list. Although the characters are not picture perfect (and they shouldn\u2019t!) each and everyone\u2019s positive qualities are highlighted, and the author doesn\u2019t try to make her female lead stand out, rather she just lets her shine on her own, you\u2019ll notice. I\u2019d like to point out that this book is full of positivism, the relationships portrayed feel real and relevant and it definitely stays away from cliches, and it\u2019s all so clearly refreshing.\n\u201cYou never owe another person something, no matter how nice they are to you. Relationships aren\u2019t transactions\u201d\nEven if romance takes a huge part in the development of this story (I mean, look at the title!) Our girl Natalie never loses her focus on the path she knows she should be following, taking a leap of faith isn\u2019t the same as derailing, her search is first and foremost for her self-discovery. Is being Native American part of these experiences? Or there\u2019s an otherworldly reason?I feel a bit doubtful about the ending, I wish I could elaborate but I don\u2019t want to spoil anybody. What I did like, however, is that it is those kinds where it might be open-ended but not unclear, and it is satisfactory for me, to see a book succeed at this attempt. This is certainly not a cut and dry book and there\u2019s definitely a lot to examine, and up for debate.The Love That Split The World is a mix of great complex ideas without being messy. Each relationship between Natalie and the characters contributes and leaves a bit of something to the reader; with Natalie\u2019s family, unconditional love, with Rachel, acceptance, with Matt, understanding, with Megan, mutual support, with Beau, that it doesn\u2019t matter if someone else makes you feel the most. And specially with herself, that it is okay to not know everything about yourself.\n\nBookstagram | Twitter | Tumblr | Facebook"}, {"userName": "Giselle (Book Nerd Canada)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5789353-giselle-book-nerd-canada", "userReview": "A finished copy was provided by the publisher for review.Natalie Cleary used to be the most popular girl in school cheerleader and girlfriend to Matt the quarterback. She also has brightest future ahead of her, going to the Ivy League school, Brown University. This is her last summer before college and she should be preparing, yet she can't. Her nightmares are back and with that comes Grandmother. She has been visited by this woman several times, telling her stories of her Native American background. Until things start to change around her. Flickers of the people she knows, doing things they normally wouldn't do. Instantly being drawn by a boy she hasn't seen before and has never existed in her world. Could there be something else drawing them together?I am happy to report I am not the black sheep, I kind of fell in love with the writing. Emily Henry knows how to pull and tug and twist your heart all around. At first, nothing is really grabbing at me until Natalie started seeing things. The whole time traveler part was the most fun. But then the science behind it was being explained and my eyes glazed over. I tried to understand it but for the life of me I will never understand time and worm holes. It always confuses me. \u00a0I liked how it was incorporated though so it wouldn't end being just another love story.The romance kind of felt too instant for me, but I forgave the book because after reading it, I just couldn't stop remembering the beauty of love. How much love can be found from not only romantic relationships but from family and friends. This is that story, Natalie loves all of her people and they love her back. She never felt so out of place until now. Being adopted and half\u00a0Native American in a predominantly white community can make you feel like isolated. That's one of the things I loved about this book, hearing and reading about their Native stories. It was wholly new and refreshing. I loved how her family was portrayed. Her twin siblings and even her dog Gus who is just this big drool monster. Her friendship with her best friend is adorable. I like how they spell out all the words when texting and not use chat lingo. Then her relationship with Matt. He seemed like a jerk but there were underlying issues that were only addressed later on in the book. And then there's Beau. He fit the \"bad boy with a heart of gold\" cliche boyfriend, but for some reason I didn't mind.\u00a0The Love that Split the World is one debut that will have you reminisce how much love can change a person's life.

Also, I think I won\u2019t be able to sleep if I wouldn\u2019t find out who Grandmother is. Yes, that\u2019s what intrigued me most and not so much the boy that Natalie needed to save. I appreciate the plot devices used in the story. There\u2019s a little of history, a lot of mystery, sci-fi, time-travel, psychology, fantasy and magical realism but as to what the story is mainly trying to say, I\u2019m still not sure. Safest to say, the story is about love. Grandmother\u2019s stories kind of remind me of A Monster Calls Yew Tree\u2019s stories and for the most part, it\u2019s these stories that mostly encouraged me to keep reading on.   \u201cBut until I can figure out my own place in all of this, I want to hear other people\u2019s stories. Knowing stories that have been around forever and have almost been lost a hundred times already, it feels important.\u201d Also the friendship between the main character and her best friend is very admirable.  \u201cYou know, I like to think of myself as somehow expert on my best friend, but the truth is I have no idea how to help with all of this.

At some point, I just wanted for the book to be over which is not a good sign because often you don\u2019t want a good book to end. Getting to the end to me felt like running on a street maid of jell-o. The path looks nice but you could imagine my struggle. Alas, the conclusion only left me underwhelmed.

It was beautifully written, full of touching moments, amazing friendships, wonderful humor, and truly a love that was powerful enough to split the world. Emotion levels were high for pretty much the whole book and I was so captivated by Natalie and Beau. I love Emily Henry's ability to bring me into this story, easily convince me that all of this was humanly possible, and even more so, to bring so many emotions into it as well. Every single relationship was wonderful, complicated, and meaningful. From friendships to romances to siblings to parents -- everything was so incredibly well done, realistic, and touching. Even Natalie's own \"relationship\" with herself (or rather, her own self-discovery) was interesting and beautiful to watch as well as unique. I adored how Emily Henry took this concept of alternate worlds and/or time travel (I won't divulge exactly what is going on there because the reader needs to discover that!) and really blur the lines between science-fiction, reality, and also the expectations of how alternate worlds/time travel occur and/or function. It felt wholly unique and incredibly special. This book was truly special and I just was so involved while reading it. One I will absolutely recommend and hopefully re-read too! Full review as originally posted HERE on The Book Addict's Guide 2/2/16: As soon as I started reading, I knew that THE LOVE THAT SPLIT THE WORLD was a special book. Emily Henry\u2019s writing immediately hooked me and I was instantly transported into Natalie\u2019s world, fully involved in her story. Even after thirty pages, I knew that I would fall in love with this book. With moments that reminded me of childhood favorite WALK TWO MOONS, I was immediately invested (in so many ways, really) and this turned out to be a very special read for me.At first, I wasn\u2019t sure exactly what to expect from THE LOVE THAT SPLIT THE WORLD. From the synopsis, it sounded like a book about alternate universes but I couldn\u2019t tell if it was going to be more contemporary, more science-fiction, or none of the above. I ended up with a lot of contemporary romance feelings as I read about the epic romance between Natalie and Beau and I easily got swept up in their whirlwind romance. I absolutely loved that there was a sense that these two simply belonged together. There are books that proclaim destiny and connections but Emily Henry\u2019s writing truly convinced me that these two souls were irrevocably connected, which left me feeling quite impressed! The way the story was written and how everything fell into place really had me feeling that connection instead of just being told it was there. I become utterly involved in Natalie and Beau\u2019s story and couldn\u2019t tear my eyes away from the page!The characters were wonderfully developed! Each character had many layers and each of their relationships did as well. Of course I can sing praises of the romance but really one of my favorite relationships in the book was Natalie\u2019s friendship with Megan. Their friendship really reminded me of my own with my best friends and it just felt so genuine and true. It was an easy friendship and the two girls also had an incredibly strong bond, able to talk about anything and everything, including some humor that you only experience with a best friend. I instantly connected with their friendship and it really developed their characters even more!I was also pleased to see the relationship that Natalie had with her family. Being adopted, she does struggle at times to feel like she fits in, especially when her siblings are actually biological children, but they do have a special familial bond that also just felt so genuine. I could really feel the hesitation as Natalie tries to find out if and where she fits in but she still has a strong love for every person in her family.Natalie\u2019s self-discovery was also incredibly so well-done. Having her hallucinations/visions sets her apart even more, on top of the fact that she\u2019s adopted and looks nothing like her family (Natalie being of Native American heritage and her family having pale skin and red hair). She struggles to find out where exactly she belongs and as high school ends, the crisis escalates even further. It was wonderfully subtle and obvious all at the same time and I really felt for Natalie as she tried to figure out exactly who she was and where she fit in. I think we\u2019ve all been through a similar phase but Natalie faces much bigger questions, especially as her life comes to a major crossroads with her latest \u201cvisitation\u201d from a wise figure that she calls Grandmother.As much as the book was partially a love story, it was also quite magical. I loved the Native American traditions and folklore that really set the tone of the novel and tied into Natalie\u2019s current timeline. It was just wonderful to read each story and connect it to a specific moment, even if I couldn\u2019t make that connection until later on in the book. Natalie learns and and repeats creation myths, tradition origins, and life lessons through each story and I really loved experiencing and learning about each one as I read. I also felt like it offered a little explanation and left clues for what was happening to Natalie and why.I do want to touch on large concept of the book involving the concept of parallel universes and the sci-fi/magical aspect but I don\u2019t want to give anything away so all I will really say about that is how much I loved it and how well everything connected. Natalie, Beau, and the readers are really trying to figure out throughout the book why their surroundings keep changing, why their friends are acting differently, and what the deal is with what is happening to them. It was an incredible journey and discovery to witness so I\u2019ll leave all of the details inside the pages of the book but I was so impressed with the way it was done, including all of the reveals. The tension and suspense really picks up towards the end and I had a few rushes of emotion as things finally took shape and started to reveal themselves. It felt like a wonderful take on a commonly used concept and I just really loved how original it all felt!Oh wow, clearly I can gush for days on end about this book but when it comes down to it, I can sum it up by repeating how special this book really was. I had feelings on top of feelings with a dash of amazement and a thirst for knowledge. THE LOVE THAT SPLIT THE WORLD was so incredibly well-written and I think it\u2019ll appeal to such a wide audience, spanning genres and age ranges alike. Don\u2019t miss this book, friends! It\u2019s a keeper."}, {"userName": "Carole (Carole's Random Life in Books)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5892196-carole-carole-s-random-life-in-books", "userReview": "This review can also be found at Carole's Random Life.I think that my expectations for this book were set way too high. I was really needing to read one of those books that grab a hold of you and refuses to let go. On Goodreads, the reviews are amazing so I decided that this would be the next book that I fell in love with and it almost worked. I liked it but I didn't fall in love with it. I am giving this book a very generous 4 stars but it comes very close to being a 3 star read for me. The overall premise of the story was very interesting. Natalie starts seeing things wrong. Things in her town seem to appear and disappear but she is the only one who seems to notice. She has been visited by Grandmother for much of her life and has been in a lot of therapy as a result. Grandmother spends her visits telling stories which I found to be very engaging. Natalie meets a young man named Beau just as things start happening rapidly. When Natalie learns that she has three months to save him, she must figure out what is going on and who she needs to save. This book did have a lot of things going for it. It was truly a unique story that kept me guessing. This book actually kept me up past my bedtime more than once just because I felt like I needed to figure out what was going on. The pacing of the story was nearly perfect with information being share piece by piece in a manner that really kept my interest. I did enjoy the overall writing style.There were also a few things that I didn't care for as much in this story. I was able to figure out the two main mysteries in the book very early on. I was actually very disappointed when my predictions were correct. I did get a little tired of the focus on the romance in this story. There were so many other things going on that were more interesting that I really wanted to stay focused on. I honestly did not care for how this book ended...at all. When I turned the last page and realized that the book was actually ending as it did, I wanted to throw it across the room. I would recommend this book to fans of Young Adult novels. I do think that this book will prove to be very popular largely due to its uniqueness. This is the first novel by Emily Henry and I look forward to reading her future works.I received an advance reader edition of this book from Penguin Group - Razorbill via First to Read for the purpose of providing an honest review.Initial ThoughtsI am wavering between 3 and 4 stars on this one. It was an unique story that kept me reading past my bedtime. I liked it well enough and had to find out what the heck was going on but I was ultimately somewhat let down at the conclusion. My guess very early in the book regarding the two big mysteries in the story ended up being absolutely correct which my prediction which was a bit disappointing."}, {"userName": "Lela", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21823248-lela", "userReview": "[ time-travel /dimension travel concept  (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Celine (celinereads)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37159161-celine-celinereads", "userReview": "4/5 starsI found this book to be SO confusing, but I kind of liked it because it made me think.

It really is a thing of beauty. In fact, it is so gorgeous that I would love to have it as a poster on my wall, right next to my bed. And let me tell you, that's a prime spot for a poster. So whoever designed that cover - FREAKING GOOD JOB! If I ever write a book, I would want you to design my cover.Now that the cover admiration is over (I MEAN LOOK AT IT), it is time to talk about the book itself. My expectations were extremely high, probably the highest for any 2016 release I've heard about so far. Expectations can be dangerous, and I feel more often than not, the book itself does not match all of the anticipation and excitement I've centered around it. That wasn't the case with The Love that Split the World. This book completely and utterly blew me away and provided me with a memorable reading experience. If you are familiar with my blog or my previous reviews, you might know that I like to drag Friday Night Lights and my lover Tim Riggins to every conversation possible. When the official descriptions for books actually mention Friday Night Lights, I am ready to party! With The Love that Split the World, there's also a mention of The Time Traveler's Wife, which I was not a huge fan of, but honestly, because that FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS mention is there, I don't really care (the thing is though that if it would have only mentioned The Time Traveler's Wife, I probably would not have been as excited). The FNL reference is not there for a reason. There's football involved in this story, though that definitely isn't the focus of it. And then there's Beau, who instantly reminded me of Tim Riggins. He's bit of a partyboy (at least that's his reputation), he lives with his washed out brother (Billy Riggins, anyone?) and even the way he is described to look like instantly made me see Tim Riggins (I often see Tim Riggins in many descriptions, just because he is SO DREAMY). So, how does our main character Natalie and Beau (aka almost-as-dreamy-as-tim-riggins) meet? Well, to get an answer to that, we first need to look into Natalie. In her childhood Natalie spent many a night talking to \"Grandmother\", a mysterious apparition that shows up on her bedside and tells her stories that are part of Natalie's personal history. When Natalie was a baby, she was adopted by her parents from a young Native American girl who struggling with honey and the rules of her reservation saw it best to give her child elsewhere. After those first few years old ignorant bliss, Natalie started to notice that she does not exactly look like the rest of her family. Through the stories told by Grandmother, she gets a touch into her true heritage and identity.Natalie is about to graduate and spend her last summer in Kentucky before attending college when Grandmother shows up again after three years of absence. This time she tells Natalie that she has three months to save \"him\" without specifying who that \"him\" is. The next time, the roads of Natalie and Beau get entwined and very soon Natalie realizes that Beau will play a huge role in her mission for the summer. The characters in this book are so great! Natalie is such an interesting character to read about, and I loved the fact that as a reader, I got a chance to make discoveries about her at the same time she does. This made it easy for me to identify with her, to some extent, and more importantly, to feel for her and to connect with her on a very deep level. I also really liked the fact that there are two guys in Natalie's life without a very epic and cliche love triangle. There's Matt, Natalie's first love and ex-boyfriend who proves himself to be something completely different Natalie thought. And then there's the wonderful Beau, who's slightly mysterious and might not be heard of for days (there will be a very good explanation for that), but who's also so kind that it kind of makes Natalie want to cry. I am also a huge fan of YA novels that involve some kind of family component, and this one has that too! The fact that Natalie is adopted creates an interesting tension between the daughter who is trying to find herself and the family that is desperately trying to prove to Natalie that she fits in despite her different heritage. I love the way Emily Henry writes the interactions between Natalie and her family, especially Nat and her mother. For a while now, I've been a huge fan of amazing friendship narratives! And believe it or not, The Love that Split the World has that too (it really is true, this book pretty much has anything I want from a YA novel). The friendship between Natalie and her best friend Megan is complex, loving, filled with humor and not without its problems. They do not agree about everything and their friendships is not just pillow fights and talking about boys (okay I don't remember when I actually read a friendship story that was like this, but you probably get my point), which makes them much more real. They are not afraid to laugh at each other and I got the feeling that whatever they come across, they will get through it with each other's support. I bet a lot of the things I have mentioned in this review so far instantly make you think about a contemporary novel (expect maybe the randomly appearing grandmother), but The Love that Split the World is so much more. There's an element of time travel in it which adds an element of the fantastical to it. Then there's also this aspect to the novel that introduces the reader to psychological terms and practices through the counselling Natalie does in an attempt to get in contact with Grandmother to gain more information about her mission. The stories Grandmother tells to Natalie also add an element of fantasy to the story as well as an almost dream-like quality. Emily Henry writes with so much detail that at no point while reading this I felt like \"naah, this does not just feel real/explained enough/logical\". From page one until the very end, I was extremely immersed with this story and couldn't stop turning the pages so I could learn what happens to Natalie, her family, Beau, Matt, Megan and the others. While reading this book, I continually had the sense that Emily Henry has put so much passion and research and love towards the details of this story and its characters. The Love that Split the World is a marvel of young adult literature, a beautiful and vivid tale about family, trust, heritage and first love. It took my breath away, provided me with an extremely enjoyable reading experience and proved to me, once again, why I love young adult literature so damn much."}, {"userName": "Stacee", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7359586-stacee", "userReview": "There is nothing I could say that could express just how much I loved this book."}, {"userName": "Andrea", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10105567-andrea", "userReview": "\u201cThis is the story of the beginning of the world, and the woman who fell from the sky.\u201d\n\nThe Plot\nThe Love That Split the World is, at its core, a romance.

With contemporary, paranormal, and time travel elements, The Love That Split the World is a unique and refreshing read.Natalie Cleary is enjoying her last summer at home before heading off to college when she starts seeing things. It leaves you wondering what is or isn\u2019t real.

And being adopted she often struggles with finding ways to relate to her family, especially her siblings, and I found it to be awfully realistic. Another interesting character was Grandmother. Is she God? A figment of Natalie\u2019s imagination? A ghost? She has been showing up in Natalie\u2019s life for years. She always brings Natalie stories from her culture and with them life-lessons.\nThe Writing\nThe writing was gorgeous! Each word was carefully placed and overall it painted an amazingly imaginative picture. I was hooked from the first chapter. The Love That Split the World is filled with stories of Native American culture and mythology from Natalie\u2019s background and they bring in a magical tone and quality to the story.If you\u2019re a fan of romances or can just tolerate the heavy romance I\u2019d really give this a try, it really is a unique and strange story.\n\"Love is giving the world away, and being loved is having the whole world to give.\""}, {"userName": "Kels", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28386116-kels", "userReview": "Goodness. It took me entirely too long to finish this book, and the simple reason for that is because I found it to be remarkably slow paced, incredibly boring, and so exceptionally easy to put down.Although I do have mixed feelings about the writing, overall I believe that Emily Henry's prose rivals many of the seasoned authors in YA fiction that I've read. It's apparent that she took great care when crafting her sentences; they are vivid and detailed without being too clunky or cluttered, and are downright beautiful at times (many times, actually). But I still felt that they lacked that intrinsic spark that pulls you into the story itself. I was left on the sidelines for the entire read, because the text simply wasn't engaging enough to drag me onto the playing field, and that's always a big problem as well as a huge disappointment for me.Whereas the concept of the story had me intrigued and thoroughly impressed, the plot and the execution failed to do either. Time travel, alternate universes, and anything dealing with the space-time continuum consists of some of my favorite sub-genres to explore, because in real life these concepts intrigue me and I will gladly spend hours watching documentaries and reading peer-reviewed science journals on such topics, just to idly pass time. The problem though, with such speculative fiction, is the many and varied paradoxes that manifests itself inevitably in relation to a break/shift/alter in time. As one can imagine, it gets chaotic. So yeah, it's incredibly hard to avoid plot holes when dealing with such topics, maybe even impossible, but Emily Henry does not even try to tighten them up. She leaves them wide and gaping, and not only does she put minimal effort in trying to close those holes up, but at the ending she throws caution and apparently all good sense to the wind and gets out a machete to slash what little fabric is holding this story together to shreds. And can I just say that I knew who Grandma was from the start. It was so obvious, and because the majority of this book was centered on \"finding Grandma,\" it made my interest wan and flatline throughout several portions of the book. But my biggest problem with TLTSTW was hands down the romance. For starters, there was no chemistry. NONE. Beau and Natalie was thrown together so unnaturally and forcibly, it made me cringe whenever they made out. It really bothered me how they met, and suddenly fell in love, and when they started picking out their kids name... I may have gagged a little. For me, I wasn't buying it, and it turned me off on Natalie's character with how her world just suddenly shifted to revolve around Beau. You may or may not believe this, but truly I'm a romantic at heart. So trust me when I say, there's nothing romantic about a teenage girl obsessing over a boy she just met. And that leads me to the twisted ending.Okay, I had an inkling to how the ending was going to play out, so I wasn't all that surprised, but what caught me completely off guard was the purpose of Grandma's presence in Natalie's life. For one, she was so incredibly evasive and vague in the beginning, but at the ending she was so long winded with her outrageously ridiculous explanations to why she surfaced in her life. Talk about melodramatic and inefficiency, because Grandma is the very definition of both. She could have saved Natalie a whole lot of trouble and aimless wonderings if she just would have freaking spit it out in the beginning. But of course, no, because then we have no book. But what tops that is what Grandma wants Nat to do and how she asks her to do it. I'm not going to spoil the ending for anyone that decides to pick up this book, but let me tell me you how much I hated the ending: A LOT. Like you know that theory that space is ever expanding at an exponential rate that we can't even keep up with? Yeah, you do? Great. So is my hate for the ending of this book. It just keeps on growing the more I think about it, because how freaking ridiculous.There were other things, too, that annoyed me. Like how Nat's family conveniently faded into the background as well as her friendships, and her ENTIRE social life. But again, that tends to happen when you make a person the center of your universe.Emily Henry's debut novel has been embraced with warm hugs, and a great deal of five star ratings--so feel free to consider this review as an outlier--but there were just so many fails happening in The Love That Split the World that I feel completely generous handing out two stars to this novel."}, {"userName": "alexandra", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6784858-alexandra", "userReview": "4.5/5TLTSTW is so deeeeeeep. do you ever read a book and feel the need to stop every once in a while to let it sink in? this was that for me. i'm in love with emily henry's writing style, as it gives me an existential crisis but is also light hearted. the writing and thought/themes executed is def my favorite part of this novel.i don't know how to describe this plot. TLTSTW is a fantasy, contemporary, sci-fi hybrid thing that has TIME TRAVEL. i didn't know that before i began, so that's nice to know. i honestly don't know what to make of the story. i think it's more about \"finding yourself\" than anything else. the summary in the back really doesn't give this book justice.i was just the slightest bit annoyed at the beginning and ending. the beginning is incredibly slow, in my opinion. i have no idea what's going on and i don't know where we're going. the ending has a lot of shock and plot twists, which is great, but feels unfinished. like, REALLY unfinished. or implied. i appreciate how we're left to imagine the end ourselves, but really? i just... UGH ONE MORE CHAPTER PLEASE.the characters are so dynamic and i love it! so much! they're all so unique and beautifully diverse and FLAWED. it's fantastic. the friendships and family love also makes me really happy. the romance seemed just a liiiiittle insta-love-y, but i ended up loving the two of them in the end as well so \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00afoverall, TLTSTW is a fantastic debut. it's different, a little strange, but all-in-all lovely. i especially love the writing and themes, and only wish the pacing were a bit better."}, {"userName": "Shannon (It Starts At Midnight)", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8652150-shannon-it-starts-at-midnight", "userReview": "This review was originally posted on It Starts at Midnight  Since there really wasn't anything I didn't like (though I will say that I was iffy for the first couple chapters- so know that going in, because it gets amazing and you do\u00a0not want to miss out), I am just going to tell you what I did!  The characters were\u00a0amazing. They were very well fleshed out, and I loved them. Friends and family were very key, even though there's also a very ship-worthy romance. I liked that there could still be a focus on family and friends while the romance built! Plus, the characters just seemed so, so real. You could really just see\u00a0why they were making certain choices, because what they were doing truly fit the personalities that had been carved out for them. \n   The plot is glorious! It's definitely unique, and definitely held my attention. I wasn't really sure how it would all work out, and I was really thrown by a few twists- in a very good way! I was kept guessing the whole time, and since I was so invested in the characters, the stress and emotions were high! \n   The feels were intense. I think that because the world building, plot, and characters were so well developed, I couldn't help\u00a0but feel\u00a0all the emotions during this book. There were swoons, and chuckles, and tears, and I loved it. \n   Bottom Line: It's glorious! I love it, and I would throw it at any and all of you so you can read it too.
