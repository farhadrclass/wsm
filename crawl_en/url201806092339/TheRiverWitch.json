When Roslyn seeks respite and recovery on Manny's Island, Georgia--where \"time seemed to slip around\"--and she meets young Damascus, with her pumpkins and hoodoo, the two share a bond of loss and hope. Then through the magic and people of Manny's Island, Roslyn finds strength and a renewed passion for life. This is a complex and beautiful story, beautifully told."}, {"userName": "Ginifer", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6505180-ginifer", "userReview": "The River Witch is phenomenal \u2013 one of the best books I\u2019ve ever read; the kind of book that resonates deep inside and you know will linger there always. It is unfathomable to me that this is Kimberly Brock\u2019s debut novel\u2026and there is no way I\u2019m going to do the book justice in this review, but I\u2019ll try. Roslyn Byrne has experienced multiple tragedies in quick succession that have left her completely lost and broken. As a professional ballerina, Roslyn worked hard to be the best dancer so her mother and grandmother would be proud of her. Faced with a tragic accident that leaves her unable to dance, and the subsequent loss of her unborn child and the death of her grandmother, Roslyn seeks refuge for the summer on Manny\u2019s Island in Georgia. The recluse house she rented for the summer seems like the perfect place to find herself, but Roslyn discovers seclusion may not be what she needs after all. Just maybe a family, also in desperate need of healing themselves, is the key to forgiveness and moving on.This is one of those books written so well you actually hear and smell and feel everything as though you\u2019re actually there. The southern culture is portrayed absolutely perfect; it\u2019s not overdone or forced. You can tell Brock is from Georgia \u2013 she knows the South. There was not a single negative in this book for me. The characters, the plot, the setting, the writing style \u2013 it\u2019s all brilliant. The narrative switches back and forth between 10 year old Damascus (a native of the island) and Roslyn; Damascus in third person and Roslyn in first, which lends the reader even more distinction between the characters. Although, their personalities are both well-defined, even if this weren\u2019t the case. I adore Damascus. I wanted to reach in and bring her home with me. And Roslyn \u2013 she\u2019s a flawed character, but I loved her to death. You really can\u2019t help but fall in love with both of them and all the secondary characters, Manny\u2019s Island, the river, the ENTIRE book.Poignant, timeless, and breathtaking - those are the three words that come to mind for The River Witch. It reminded me of an old classic, like To Kill a Mockingbird. It\u2019s completely different, but it just has that kind of feel. When it ended I was completely choked up\u2026for a while. The ending is completely satisfying; it\u2019s just that it was over. I usually devour a book in a couple of days or less if I really love it, but I spread this one out over a couple weeks to hang on to it a little longer. I\u2019m definitely buying the print copy, so I can pull it off my shelf and lose myself in Manny\u2019s Island every year. I realize I didn\u2019t describe very much of the book in this review, but I don\u2019t want to spoil anything. The story is very complex and emotional, sometimes humorous, and it is every bit as much about Damascus healing as it is Roslyn. Trust me; this is one you want to read immediately.**I received this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review. No incentive was offered or accepted for a favorable rating or review."}, {"userName": "Dani C.

I kept waiting for something to happen, which annoys me. But mostly it was the characters. I just couldn't identify with any of them. The 24 year old ballerina who lost everything but had all this deep insight into the behaviours of people she'd never met before, who clung to a grandmother she barely knew and a religion & people she didn't know at all, who inexplicably decided she was like or at least understood the \"conjure woman\" into whose house she moved... the 10 year old neglected child who behaved and talked like a 30 year old most times... the lady who walked away from her family to go \"find herself\" working at a Kroger pharmacy?

The review is based solely on my opinion and was not influenced by author or publisher.*\u00a0Roslyn Byrne hit rock bottom, hard. Three back to back tragedies force Roslyn to seek solitude on Manny's Island, where she's hoping to search within herself for answers. It's not solitude that she finds once she lands on the island. For the summer she has rented a house that is shrouded in mystery and rumors. She reluctantly finds a friend in her landlord's sister Ivy, an admirer in Ivy's son and a ward in Damascus, who happens to be her landlord's troubled 10 year daughter. And then there is Urey, the landlord that is as esoteric as the house itself. Through her relationships with these people, and others on the island she finds that she isn't the only one with problems. Helping the islanders work through their issues may just help Roslyn find the answers that she seeks.This book was nothing like I expected it to be, which isn't a bad thing. I had a hard time getting through the story at first as it seemed slow moving. I also felt a little confused by certain flashback scenes, I couldn't tell which direction the story was headed. Once I got used to the author's writing style and character dialogue the smoother everything flowed . I really liked the premise of the story and the fact that everything was not always sunshine and roses. Aside from the fact that some of the drama seemed a little overdone, I think the characters were realistically portrayed. I enjoyed the way the characters developed throughout the book, learning more about the kind of people they were by how they managed their situations. There is quite a bit of Southern charm that comes through in Kimberly Brock's writing as well as a Southern way of life. I think this is a debut novel that shows a lot of promise."}, {"userName": "Kate Brady", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4657674-kate-brady", "userReview": "I think this is a really beautifully written book. I absolutely loved that about it, but at the same time I also agree with one of the other goodreads reviews that pointed out some problems with the writing. Sometimes I'd have to read a passage a couple of times because it didn't seem to completely make sense (though somehow managed to still be really beautiful.) It was like the author was suddenly talking about about something totally different, mid sentence or paragraph. My only other complaint is that I think I would have enjoyed the book more if I could relate to the characters more or if they just seemed more real. I liked the characters, I thought they were interesting and dynamic, but for the most part, they just didn't seem like real people, especially Damascus, the little girl who was written more like a 30 or 40 year old. I guess this was probably intentional and I think forgivable because you almost read this book as a sort of fantasy, anyway. But over all, I really loved it. The story is full of southern imagery, witchy/halloweeny imagery, and magical imagery, all expressed wonderfully through the writing. The story itself is thought-provoking and satisfying at times.

Her southern charm whisked me away into the lives of Roslyn and Damascus, one adult and one child, each searching for meaning and hope in their circumstances.

When she loses the baby she wasn\u2019t sure she wanted during a premature and lone birth she also loses a bit of her mind and most of herself.With the future seemingly without any prospects, Roslyn yearns for the past and the Appalachian foothills where her grandmother lived until her recent death and was part of a gospel singing group.Warned against travelling back to what used to be her home by her mother, Roslyn instead travels to Manny\u2019s Island, Georgia for the summer bringing her granny\u2019s music with her.On the island the broken dancer meets ten-year-old Damascus Trezevant, a girl with her own broken heart, looking for a way to mend her life with the aid of pumpkin seeds. When Roslyn reluctantly gets involved with Damascus and her family she finds herself stumbling into a world where superstition and hoodoo magic are part of everyday life and where blind alligators will find their way into your home.Over the course of the summer Roslyn has to find a new purpose for her life and the Trezevant family has to bury the ghosts from the past in order to move forwards. It will be a time of pain and dashed hopes as well as insights that lead to new opportunities.This is a beautiful and very well written story. Roslyn\u2019s pain and despair are palatable for the reader as are Damascus\u2019 childish yet very recognisable hopes.The setting of Manny\u2019s Island is equally haunting and beautiful. The descriptions of the place make it easy to believe that magic could and would happen there, without turning the island into a Fantasy Island style paradise. In fact, paradise is far removed from Manny\u2019s Island and those who live there, except that it is a place where some may find hope and redemption.There are no easy, happy endings in this book. This is real life where hard-knocks come to people and they have to deal with them best they can regardless of their age, history or past mistakes.I admire the author for not taking what early on in the book seemed to be the easy and predictable way out. It made this story more real, if a lot sadder.I\u2019m not at all surprised that this book comes with a host of very positive editorial reviews; it deserves every single one of them. I will therefore leave the final word on this book with Sharyn McCrumb because I couldn\u2019t put it better myself:\"There is magic and wonder in \"The River Witch,\" but the real enchantment here is the strength of the characters Roslyn and Damascus. Their voices are the current that carries the reader along in this compelling tale of healing and discovery.\""}, {"userName": "Elizabeth Drake", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2230747-elizabeth-drake", "userReview": "This and other reviews can be found on Reading Between ClassesCover Impressions: The cover is pretty but were I to see it on a bookshelf I am not sure that it would stand out enough to entice me to buy it. The Gist: Former ballerina Rosyln Byrne lost everything that defined her in one fell swoop. She has retreated to a remote Georgia island in the hopes that solitude and serenity will allow her to patch up her broken life. Instead she finds herself in the middle of another shattered family and in the path of a little girl desperately seeking something magical.Review: Every summer I tend to feel the urge to dive into the world of magical realism. The River Witch falls into that category, but also offers up something unexpected. The setting of this novel makes for a fantastic summer read. It left me longing for a big old house with lots of history and a river with more than a little danger. As the days start to stretch, the thought of retreated to an island and escaping the stress of everyday life is more than a little tempting. This is not a novel with a fast paced plot and the story clearly falls on the character's very capable shoulders. Rosyln has an impressive voice and her pain is almost palpable as she reflects on losing her child and the life she left behind in her mountain home. The music from her homeland weaves in and out of the narrative, binding it beautifully together. Ten year old Damascus is outspoken, precocious and utterly charming. She is especially broken by the loss of her mother and her father's inability to fulfill his role as caregiver. While searching for answers inside a pumpkin seed, she and Rosyln slowly allow themselves to open up to the idea of being cared for. This is not a novel for the thrill seeking or action obsessed. The plot unwinds slowly, like a lazy afternoon, and wraps itself around your heart. The writing is beautiful and gentle, occasionally erupting with witty moments (usually through Damascus). Brock weaves a story of regret and eschews the easy, romantic route that sometimes defines this genre. There are no storybook endings here, but what the reader does get is a much more realistic portrayal of human nature and the strength of history and family. A stunning debut novel and a wonderful addition to anyone's summer reading."}, {"userName": "Jillyn", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5818960-jillyn", "userReview": "I received this book through Goodreads First Reads.Needing a break from a more than stressful life, Rosalyn Byrne rents a house for the summer on Manny's Island, Georgia.

I'm not usually a fan of the genre, admittedly, but if all of them were written like this, my shelves would be stocked with them.Her words effectively paint a picture to the extent that I felt I was watching Damascus & Rosalyn's stories unfold, not just reading some text. Each of the characters was detailed & relatable, & by the time the book was over I thought I truly knew them.I am pleasantly surprised that this book didn't end at all how I thought.

I admit that I cried, which I also wasn't expecting. It's very powerful, & even in the happier parts there is an underlying tone of haunting & despair. In my opinion, that makes it even more beautiful.The only negative for me was that I felt it ended too abruptly. It lazes along at a good pace, like a summer day in Georgia, but then all of a sudden everything unravels (or ravels, depending on the character) & then the story's over.

At the urging of her mother, she travels to the Sea Isles of Georgia for escape and healing. It is on Manny\u2019s Island that Roslyn learns that sometimes healing hurts, but that suffering can bring about more beauty and blessing than we can ever anticipate.A superstitious local woman, a precocious ten-year-old girl named Damascus, and her elusive and troubled father, Urey, are just a few of the island\u2019s inhabitants with whom Roslyn becomes entangled. While the locals speculate on why so many alligators have arrived at the same time as this out of towner, Roslyn makes her home in the swamps, watching over a motherless girl who thinks a crop of pumpkins will bring her a special kind of magic.While the families unravel around her, Roslyn finds herself getting more and more lost in her own past, hearing the sweet sounds of her grandmother\u2019s Sacred Harp singers on the breeze and in her heart.

She fights against the pain raging inside of her which is so heartbreaking to observe. Ms. Brock captures this so well that I wanted to step through the pages and hug Damascus forever.Urey, Ivy, and Nonnie Trezevant all challenge Roslyn in ways that force her look inside herself, to discover what she is made of.

Looking forward to reading more from Ms. Brock and maybe taking a visit to the South."}, {"userName": "Donna Ferraro", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12542394-donna-ferraro", "userReview": "I am disappointed in this book (nearly finished with it). Story should have worked but writing is disjointed with many discrepancies. There were parts that were well written and other parts that were redundant and/or poorly written. I'll put it down to poor editing and try to give the author some credit."}, {"userName": "Lori Spielman", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10707252-lori-spielman", "userReview": "The River Witch is a rich, captivating story of loss and redemption, love and forgiveness. Set in the south, Kimberly Brock's descriptions are so vivid you can almost feel the river's tide and taste the warm pumpkin bread. If you loved Sue Monk Kidd's THE SECRET LIFE OF BEES, you'll fall in love Kimberly Brock's beautiful novel."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1384704-heather", "userReview": "Overall, this is an impressive debut novel by Kimberly Brock, full of emotion and atmosphere. The writing is powerful and I enjoyed the treatment of grace. At times the plot is a bit slow-moving and some stretches of dialogue are unrealistic. Nonetheless, it's an entertaining story."}, {"userName": "Marya", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1209268-marya", "userReview": "I don't know why this book got such good reviews.

Brock, a native Southerner and former actor and special needs educator, is the blog network coordinator at She Reads. She also reviews fiction and interviews authors on her website. Her intense love of storytelling is readily apparent.\tIt should come as no surprise to learn that Brock wrote her first novel when she was in fourth grade. As evidenced in her debut The River Witch, writing comes as naturally and as easily to Brock as reading and breathing. \tIn The River Witch, Brock focuses her narrative lens on Roslyn Byrne, a former ballerina now broken in body and shattered in soul. A car accident left Roslyn unable to dance again; a miscarriage left Roslyn hollow and in a kind of in-between world. She seeks solace on isolated Manny\u2019s Island, Georgia, to escape the world and to finally bestow a name on her deceased baby.\tRoslyn is a very sympathetic character, yet this reader never feels sorry for her. She is a strong woman who comes from a long line of strong women. Roslyn requires the use of a cane to help her walk. The cane provides physical aid to Roslyn, but it is also symbolizes her wounded psyche.  There are many, many issues Roslyn grapples with in the cabin she rents on the island. With the character of Roslyn, Brock has created a three-dimensional figure we not only relate to but also root for. Brock\u2019s first-person perspective of Roslyn allows us to see her flaws, her disappointments, and her regrets; Brock also lets us see Roslyn\u2019s triumphs. Her indomitable will is palpable and resonates throughout the story.\tRoslyn is not the only broken creature on Manny\u2019s Island. Ten-year-old Damascus Trezevant is a lonely and dejected little girl who aches for her deceased mother and her largely absent father. She is drawn to Roslyn, just as Roslyn is captivated by Damascus. In contrast to Roslyn\u2019s narrative, Brock writes Damascus\u2019 perspective in the third person. I like the difference. The distinction illustrates Brock\u2019s range as a storyteller.\tThe beauty of The River Witch is in the complicated and beautiful ballet between Roslyn and Damascus. Damascus alternately displays both affection and spite toward Roslyn. Both principal characters have pent-up emotions that they must exhibit or everyone will suffer the consequences. Both of Brock\u2019s protagonists ache for an emotional connection and a sense they belong.\tOne character who I would have liked to see more of is Urey, Damascus\u2019 father. Mysterious, taciturn, introspective, sexy, and almost savage, Urey needs more of a presence in Brock\u2019s story. Roslyn\u2019s chemistry with him is powerful.\tSince Brock is from Georgia, The River Witch is written in a distinctly Southern voice. I cannot imagine this novel being set anywhere else. In the story, sense of place is a formidable force. Manny\u2019s Island is a locale that allows Brock to imbue supernatural elements into her story. The magic of the island and the magic of Brock\u2019s characters will transform the land and its people forever.\tManny\u2019s Island can sometimes be a wild and dangerous place. Snakes and alligators are abundant. The current of the Little Damascus River can carry novice swimmers into the Atlantic. Flooding is common. Yet the island is also a place for miracles, where a woman is healed, where a child is mended, and where the wrongs of the past are reconciled. \tBrock is already at work on her second novel. If it\u2019s anything like The River Witch, it will be a must-read."}], "description": "Broken in body and spirit, she secludes herself in the mystical wilderness of a Georgia island.
