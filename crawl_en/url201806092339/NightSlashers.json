I created this profile just so I could leave a review for this book. I'm seldom passionate enough about anything I read to actually sit down and say something about it one way or the other. But I absolutely loved this book. Suspense, Romance, engaging funny characters, murder, twists and turns, hell what else could I ask for. I loved Victor, I mean he was an a$$, but he reminded me of so many people. It was so easy to visualize everything that was going on. What else can I say...I loved it!!!"}, {"userName": "Sheri", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1909602-sheri", "userReview": "Night Slashers by Rashad FreemanDaniel Montague has buried a secret for so long.

I really enjoy a good mystery and boy did i get one. There were soo many twists involved. Everytime i thought i knew who did it, they ended up dead and keeping me guessing.

Daniel moves to New Orleans to start a new life. He has a beautiful wife and a thriving surgical practice and believes nothing could go wrong. Unbeknownst to Daniel, his past comes back as unexplained deaths start to stack up. These murders are hitting close to home and Daniel finds himself in the middle. Daniel has to face his past if he hopes to have a future.Night Slasher was a psychological thriller and mystery that had me on the edge of my seat. It had drama, murder and a secret that will shock readers. Having been the first book I have read by this author I can say I really enjoyed the suspense and the unsuspected twist at the end of the book. The book did have a variety of death scenes but the author does a wonderful job with leading up to each scene with great details. On the other hand, Daniel\u2019s flashback in story may throw readers off but they are necessary for readers to relate to his character. I do believe this book would be great for film and applaud this author.

He's a plastic surgeon. With a lucrative career, good friends and a beautiful wife, one could say he has it all. But as we all know, a life filled with glitter is not always gold. When the return of an old friend begins to turn his world upside down, Daniel attempts to cling on to his sanity and the secret he's tried so hard to bury has come to light, and with it, a price to be paid. I was introduced to this book by the author and was glad I took the opportunity to read it. I was intrigued from the first chapter and honestly, I had a hard time putting it down. I liked playing the \"guessing game\" and loved the authors descriptive story telling...so much that I could picture the scenes as if it was a movie I was watching. The only down side...It was a little too fast paced for me. I wanted to get to know the characters more. perhaps, as the series continues, I'll get more of that. I read this book during the late hours while the house was quiet...perfect setting for this murder mystery."}, {"userName": "Bert", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22587665-bert", "userReview": "This is a great story with believable characters and a captivating crime mystery plot. I hope the writer does a sequel, as I got rabidly interested in how the tangled web of intrigue would be resolved. I'm only giving the book three stars, however, because I was turned off by poor grammar and syntax, lack of commas or misplaced commas, dismbiguations, and malapropisms. \"Lawsuit\" is one word, not two words, and the stunt daredevil is Evil Knievel, not \"\"Evil Ken evil.\" There's sophisticated software out there, free online, to check not just spelling but also grammar and sentence structure. Disambiguations and malapropisms can be spotted electronically. Even clumsy paragraphs can be red-flagged. With a little more focus and the same fresh ideas, it is entirely possible that the young Mr. Freeman (no relation) will make it to the New York Times list of bestsellers. I will be waiting, with baited breath!!!"}, {"userName": "Saundra Flame", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12154931-saundra-flame", "userReview": "The protagonist, Daniel is this cool mysterious man who had me at hello.

And if it is free, don't waste your time. The editing is horrible. During attacks, the author keeps switching from 'attacker' to 'attackers' or 'them'. There is only one attacker, so it is confusing using plurals. If a high school English student did this, his/her teacher would deduct marks and perhaps explain the error, but this guy gets published??? What a strange world, in which this gets published with errors still in it. It happens a lot lately, particularly with e-books. Are editors too expensive? Are authors illiterate? In any case, some readers (not me) could forgive this if the story is suspenseful and engaging, but this is really not. It kind of goes nowhere and gets quite dull in places, despite its short length, leaving the reader to not really care that much about the ending, which, well, I won't spoil it, but let me reiterate, don't waste your time. To any authors reading this review, please edit your work carefully or have someone do it for you before it gets published and becomes open to criticism. Publishing a book with errors is as avoidable as it is stupid."}, {"userName": "Michael Flanagan", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3789573-michael-flanagan", "userReview": "This book grabs you from the very beginning and does not let you go until you way after the end, as you sit there trying to process the full extent of what you have just read.. For someone like me who is not a huge fan of murder thrillers this book delivered a lot more than I was expecting. The character and plot development was just superb and each chapter had that little hook to drag you further into the story. I am not going to go into the storyline here because I don't want to ruin or diminish any of the impact of this first rate story for the reader.This book for me once again highlights to me all that is good about Indie authors and that is a vibrant and creative revolution of the publishing industry.

The characters were interstimg, fun and engaging. It was a quick read and full of intrigue and suspense.
