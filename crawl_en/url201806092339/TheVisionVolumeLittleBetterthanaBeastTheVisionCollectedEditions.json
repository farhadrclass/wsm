And let's face it, nothing is creepier than the 'burbs.I thought all the characters were wonderfully layered, which just added that extra bit of oomph to everything that happened to each of them. I really do think Tom King did a fabulous job of making Vision and his family normal and other at the same time. It was very well done and broke my heart completely at the end.There aren't a lot of Vision-centric comics out there, so it's not as though readers have much to choose from when it comes to this character.

However, he has ulterior motives...Tom King's run on The Vision comes to an end. We finally find out who the source of Vivian's brain patterns were, the source of some odd behavior on the part of the Vision over the course of the series, and whether or not The Vision is an ass-kicking machine that can take on the entire Avengers roster.Vin's Shakespeare obsession foreshadows quite a few tragedies in the series. By the end, everything is in wreckage and the lives of The Vision and his perfect family are irrevocably changed.The art team did a fantastic job on this volume, particularly Michael Walsh, Gabriel Hernandez Walta, and Jordie Bellaire, the tone perfectly matching the off-kilter, sinister, yet sometimes sweet feel of the series.Too bad the series only went twelve issues.

Reducing to three stars is a let down despite of this having a solid entertainment value.Second volume of The Vision series has a lot darker, sadder and over all depressing story arc going on, and it doesn't reach to the fantastic, witty and very much robotic dialogue than the first volume had, the one that gained my deepest love towards it.This just felt too neat, the dialogue was lacking, everything was wrapped up perfectly and there was your everyday Avengers around to give some boosting up without much of a success. But the ending gave bigger promises, so I will be awaiting for the third volume with hopes and eagerness (apparently not as this was the final volume)."}, {"userName": "David Schaafsma", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/269235-david-schaafsma", "userReview": "Portia: When he is best he is a little worse than a man, and when he is worst he is little better than a beast. --Merchant of VeniceWow, this volume, this series, ended after 12 issues and 2 volumes, alas. And this Tom King, whose Sheriff of Babylon and The Vision I have read in the same two week time period. King is a fine storyteller, by my lights, and especially a fine writer of tight dialogue. And in this series, he creates his own perspective about a Marvel superhero comic and that world. A little background from the preface to the book: \"Vision is a synthezoid, an android composed of synthetic bool and organs. He was created by Ultron to destroy the Avengers, but instead he turned on his 'father' and has been a member of the super-hero team ever since.\" Vision wants to be human, and so he creates a family for himself and moves into the suburbs. This is funny and odd and maybe slightly touching in the first volume, this desire to be ordinary, to be human. But in the second volume, Little Better Than a Beast, we see how the exploration of what it means to be human has limitations, at times. As the cover reveals: Here Lies Vision: May God Have Mercy on His Soul. We begin with some background King provides into the original love relationship between Vision and Scarlet Witch. Flashback to a post-coital bed where Vision tells her a joke. This joke seems like a throwaway initially, but resonates throughout the finale, which thanks to son Vin's passion for Shakespeare, achieves tragic proportions and passionately poetic reflection. Doubt that, from Marvel? Check this out! An epic tragic sequence follows a funny set up in a restaurant where they order food, but order it not cooked, since they can't eat it, of course, but they pay for it, anyway.I won't tell you all that happens, but trust me, if you like the ways Alan Moore raises the literary bar of comics to tragic proportions, King here has similar aspirations. It begins with Uncle Victor's arrival, and everything goes to hell. At one point there is a discussion about whether God and the soul actually exist, and the Vision and his wife doubt it, but in the ending conversation between them, even the agnostics among us will begin to doubt their doubts. Moving and powerful and quirkily funny reflection on the human condition through a sci-fi superhero tale. We see the high and low possibilities of what it might mean to be human in the losses, the love, and the grieving. One of the best of 2016, which I read in 2017."}, {"userName": "Sam Quixote", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5759543-sam-quixote", "userReview": "Vision\u2019s brother Victor visits but brings complications with him, forcing Vision to make some hard choices about his family. The Vision is one of those books that occasionally crops up like Saga that everyone goes gay for but totally baffles me as to its appeal. The second and final book in this series is a slight improvement over the first but it\u2019s still only mediocre at best. I couldn\u2019t get past how contrived the events of the first book were. Virginia does things that shouldn\u2019t have been escalated in the way they were - the drama felt completely forced. This trend continues in the second book with Victor doing something terrible for seemingly no reason, which gives us the conflict and the story in the process. Not only that but this title is almost humorously self-important and dark with its ridiculous deaths and Shakespearean quotes. I mean, Victor on some kind of robot heroin - are you kidding me!? It just takes itself so damn seriously that it makes it hard for me to read with a straight face. That said, the ending was surprisingly moving and I liked the way Tom King left things for Vision - I hope Marvel keep it that way for him for a while rather than have it self-contained to just this book. And I loved Mike Del Mundo\u2019s covers which are easily the best art this series has to offer. Tom King\u2019s writing isn\u2019t bad, it\u2019s just the story has a number of flaws I couldn\u2019t accept. Gabriel Hernandez Walta and Michael Walsh\u2019s art isn\u2019t terrible either, it\u2019s simply not that amazing. Everything\u2019s pretty much acceptable which is why I wonder what everyone else is losing their shit over - it\u2019s an ok title, but a masterpiece? Come on. The Vision, Volume 2: Little Better Than a Beast is a marginally better book than the first and ends the series well though a lot of the lead-up to it is silly and melodramatic. Obviously if you\u2019re a fan of the first book, you\u2019ll love the second, but for readers yet to take the plunge, I\u2019d say to beware the hype and not expect too much from this title."}, {"userName": "Donovan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27218681-donovan", "userReview": "\"KILLER\" book, but VERY dark.Volume 2, and the end of King's short run on the groundbreaking Vision, expands on the Vision pathos and his past. We see Vision with the Scarlet Witch, whose personality and memories became Vivian, much to her distress. And the introduction of Vision's brother, Ultron's son, Victor Mancha, an android with a dark purpose, is the catalyst to send the Vision Family spiraling further out of control. Tom King oddly reminds me of Cormac McCarthy, but he tries much harder and to greater effect. The minimal, stylistically repetitive dialog. The sparse settings. The pregnant pauses. It's dramatic, bleak, and incredibly written. But inevitably depressing...as...fuck. I'll be honest, I want more from the artwork. Jordie Bellaire's colors are fantastic, highly tonal and painterly. But Michael Walsh's illustrations in Issue #7 are sloppy, and while Gabriel Hernandez Walta illustrates really well the rest of the way, especially facial expressions, I wish the style was more bold and minimal to complement the writing tone. Think Alex + Ada. And I get the style. It's sketchy cartoony, fine, even great sometimes. Just not amazing. And also what a TERRIBLE cover. Seriously. Of all the issue covers, the editors chose the least interesting and most subdued. That's just poor marketing. Stark and bleak and tragic, sprinkled with a pinch of hope at the very end, and solidly illustrated if sometimes underwhelming. If you enjoyed Volume 1 then Little Better Than a Beast won't disappoint. 3.5 stars rounded up."}, {"userName": "Rory Wilding", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17177487-rory-wilding", "userReview": "Although he is predominately writing for DC including his current run of Batman, Tom King made a stop at Marvel where he has now made one of the best runs for the publisher in recent memory, albeit twelve issues. Continuing on with what happened in the last volume, everyone\u2019s favourite \u201csynthezoid\u201d is trying to maintain the safety of his artificial family, despite the Avengers\u2019 fear of him razing the world.From its beginning, the series has acknowledged the Vision\u2019s history (with the occasional mention of him saving the world thirty-seven times) as the story is built on the character\u2019s dream which is to be human and what\u2019s more human than to be a loving husband and father. Now obviously, if you have been following this character since his 1968 inception, you\u2019ll be aware of his conflicted romantic relationship with Wanda Maximoff aka the Scarlet Witch. Taking a break from the main plot, #7 focuses on their romance as the issue opens with a splash page featuring the two in bed gazing awkwardly into space, and thus revealing a domesticised history with more lows than highs and how it will lead to the Vision to build his own family from his own image.Despite the pleasant welcome of Vision\u2019s brother Victor Mancha, who steps in as the loving uncle who is there to comfort the conflicted family, no one comes out clean and the descent into darkness becomes even more so. Although Marvel has had its share of dark storylines (largely from Daredevil and The Punisher), Tom King is stepping into Alan Moore territory as despite more appearances of superheroes in the later issues, there are no panels feature any super-heroism as the Vision and even his family unintentionally can come across as villainous.Although I don\u2019t have a problem with Gabriel Hernandez Walta\u2019s art which fits nicely into the suburban horror, but when the book leans more towards superhero action, the art isn\u2019t quite as effective, but there is enough intimacy between the artificial characters that this is where Walta\u2019s talent lies. As for Michael Walsh, who drew issue #7, his art is sketchy compared to Walta\u2019s but manages to craft some impressive iconography, notably the Vision making out with the Scarlet Witch behind a tree, whilst the Avengers are battling their enemies in the street.It may not as strong as the first volume, but this latter half of Tom King and Gabriel Hernandez Walta\u2019s Vision run concludes a dark and twisted story of the repercussions of artificial intelligence becoming more human than human."}, {"userName": "Issa", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46324697-issa", "userReview": "Such a good book... more pathos than really a superhero story... the story of Vision and his new robot family veers towards an inevitable confrontation between Vision determined to protect his new family no matter what the cost and Worlds mightiest heroes, whom Vision used to call friends and allies... concludes one of the best superhero comics of the last few years"}, {"userName": "Matthew Quann", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22699228-matthew-quann", "userReview": "A worthy, if not entirely satisfactory, conclusion to The Vision maxi-series. I really, really enjoyed the first volume's moody, dread-filled, dark take on the Marvel Universe's favourite synthezoid. It felt like an independent-publisher take on a classic Marvel character. However, as I feared in my review of the first volume, the imminent entrance of the rest of the spandex- and armour-clad super-folk does put a bit of a damper on the second half of this series. I think that all faults laid at the feet of this volume can be traced to the problem of the shared universe. It's sort of like how you have to suspend disbelief when Spidey is in the toughest slug-fest of his life. Why doesn't Thor jump in to thrash Doctor Octopus? Best to quiet those thoughts and pretend like everybody is off fighting the Shi'ar. Alternatively, it is sometimes pleasant to imagine that the characters can exist off on their own during solo adventures, and they link up when convenient. Here, The Vision suffers only in small quantities. The central conflict revolves around the family unit introduced in the first volume and the fallout from their, surprisingly murderous, actions. The other big hindrance is the copious continuity that was laid before me in issues 7 and 8. The Vision and Scarlet Witch's complex relationship requires the kind of understanding known only to the most elite of comic nerds. Luckily, I knew all of this and was pleased with the issue. The downside: I was hoping to give this to a few friends who enjoy comics, but can't be bothered with the heavy-duty continuity. The other bit is the introduction of Victor Mancha. His introduction makes sense given the whole concept of family, but I can almost imagine my buddies putting the book down and being like, \"Are you serious? Ultron had another kid?\" I'd like to note that I love the Marvel Universe, all it's idiosyncrasies, difficulties, highs, and lows. I'd also like to note that a love of the form does not exempt it from criticism. But, even with those complaints, this is still one of the tightest series from Marvel in recent memory. I mean \"tightest\" in both the fist-bumping-bros and structural sense. All of the consequences in this book can be clearly traced back to actions in the first volume. In that sense, I can see why many reviewers have drawn comparisons with consequentialist television show Breaking Bad. Of course, this isn't that show, but it is as close as I can imagine the Marvel Universe getting.The Vision should be essential reading for all Marvel comic readers. It is a mature, dark story that is able to play to the uniqueness of the Marvel interconnected universe and only rarely suffers for it. If nothing else, I hope this prompts Marvel to engage more writers in maxi-series. Wouldn't it be interesting if every year a new writer came on to the scene to drop their particular **AHEM** vision on to a preexisting character? Though it might not work for every character, I think it would introduce a freshness to the Marvel universe much like this series. Think Fraction & Aja's Hawkeye, Hickman's Avengers, and now King & Walta's The Vision. These are comics worth noting: they are doing different things."}, {"userName": "Eric", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47615531-eric", "userReview": "4 1/2 stars"}, {"userName": "Artemy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39811979-artemy", "userReview": "I don't have much to say, except that this is the best Marvel comic since Fraction's Hawkeye, and one of the best comics of the year.

Heartbreaking, sad, and TRUE. Relationships can be bumpy as fuck, and watching a reflection of that with V is soooo sad. I also love the issue when the Avengers come into play. The way Vision acts and does things just goes to show you how important and valuable his contribution to the team is. Truly scary. The whole volume is very depressing though. It ends well, but leaves you empty. Where's the first volume I felt balanced it better, giving some light humor, and almost hitchcock type theme, this was downright fucking sad.

This volume breaks the Marvel mold by having deaths that actually matter and by having morally ambiguous characters that are neither redeemed nor portrayed as totally badass antiheroes. The last two issues are particularly good, highlighting a bond between Vision and Virginia which is creepy, destructive and simultaneously kinda sweet. I wish King had spent a little more time on the \"Pygmalion\" aspect of Virginia's story. Her husband literally built her out of pieces of his ex-wife's consciousness and she knows this, but we don't get to see much of how she processes it because there's seventeen million other things going wrong in her life for her to worry about instead.
