That does not mean that it has a bad writing style, but it was just mediocre?!I like fantasy and fiction standalones because there are not many of them and because I don't want to engage into a whole series every single time I read this genre -and I read it a lot since it is my favorite- and when I read the synopsis I was not very intrigued but I downloaded an ARC anyway because I wanted to give the author a chance (she's a doctor <3).Then I started reading this and I felt like I have read this many times before, it was like a mix of X-men (They literally say to the new recruit let's go and meet the professor!!!!) and Kingsman: the secret service. I decided to push through this hoping it will deliver something new but I expected like 99% of this.Those expectations are due to the fact that this is like every single YA novel: an annoying heroine who does not know she has powers, she suddenly develops power, she can't control them, she learns to, she becomes powerful.... etcSo in short: this was not a bad book as much as it was redundant, if you are new to the genre then this could work for you because it is light and a standalone which is pretty good, but if you read a lot of fantasy then you may want to skip this!ARC provided by the publisher via Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Cindy \u2729\u263d Savage Queen \u2654", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3222333-cindy-savage-queen", "userReview": "February ---> May and a cover change?

There\u2019s a lot of this book I enjoyed mostly the little snippets of other famous works as headings for the chapters that gave a bit of a teaser for the general mood and movement of the plot within those pages. The main character was pretty much what was to be expected for a girl thrown into a new life after everything she knows gets ripped away but she was street smart which I liked especially when she was thrown into a room with people very different from herself. The reveal of the powers themselves were a bit disappointing but I might have Disney to blame for that and because of the title they gave themselves my mind when to Merlin when in actuality I guess I should have been thinking Milo. Also the antagonist was a bit anticlimactic because while there were moments leading up to the twist it wasn\u2019t done in a way to make me remember them enough to have the betrayal hold the weight it needed to really sell it. The ending though has me confused and I think that was done nicely if there is to be more books because I\u2019d very much like to know the answer even if the book as a whole was just okay. With a bit of a Victorian Era \u2018Kingsman\u2019 and a dash of magic mixed in this book has the potential to really be something great if given the opportunity to work out the kinks and lean into what was done well now that a majority of the exposition is done and I look forward to seeing if that\u2019s an option! **special thanks to the publishers and edelweiss for providing an arc in exchange for a fair and honest review**"}, {"userName": "Mayumi", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67427834-mayumi", "userReview": "2 STARS I can\u2019t really talk about this book without including a few minor spoilers so \u2013 spoiler alert.  \u2018And no matter what else I may be, I will always be common.\u2019 Literally this book summed up in a quote. ^ So this was kinda bad\u2026 It wasn\u2019t terrible, it was just full of cliches and tropes we\u2019ve all seen before, and had an annoying protagonist. Felicity Cole is an orphan who is devoted to taking care of her \u2018Tainted\u2019 brother by selling flowers. One day her entire world is turned upside down and she\u2019s put in an inescapable situation from which she\u2019s rescued by a mysterious stranger. In return she has to use her \u2018Tainted\u2019 powers for good, and train at a spy academy for those like her. There\u2019s also a competition between the candidates for the opportunity to become an agent in this spy network.Felicity is literally a walking cliche. She\u2019s the completely clueless super special snowflake from the wrong side of the tracks who\u2019s lost it all. She catches the eye of the most popular boy from the very beginning but is bullied by jealous peers. She\u2019s not in control of her powers and is therefore looked down on and dismissed, but of course is revealed to be the most powerful of them all in the end. The plot is basically her pining for her lost love and resisting her attractions to this new boy all while trying to control her powers. What annoyed me the most was that she literally just lost the boy she loved and saw a future with, and the moment she walks into the academy she gets flustered by this other boy looking her way.  \u2018My pulse quickens a little as I wonder if I might be seated next to Julian again\u2026 I smile and then a pang of guilt curls in my stomach. Kit.\u2019 Also this girl is incredibly stupid. She tries to do things on her own and nearly ends up getting killed or getting others killed. REPEATEDLY. The amount of times she had to be rescued by Julian. Talk about #TSTL.The rest of the characters include the perfect love interest, the haughty mean girl, a couple of other forgettable people, the mysterious but wise mentor, the appearances-are-deceiving villain, and said villain\u2019s thug gang.I\u2019m sorry if I seem bitter and ranty about this book, it\u2019s just nothing about this book stands out?? And none of the characters are actually worth caring? Like it just seems like the author just put together some of the most overused and popular tropes and tried to make it work?ALSO. I\u2019m beyond confused about the \u2018plot twists\u2019 concerning her powers? If certain characters weren\u2019t real then how does this happen?? \u201cLeave it be, Kit,\u201d says John the turnip man Which\u2019d lead to another plot hole cos that character knows another character who\u2019s not real? My Overall Opinion  I didn\u2019t enjoy this as I found the main character pretty stupid and the plot to be rather unoriginal. This might appeal to those who are just getting into the genre and younger audiences maybe? I wouldn\u2019t really recommend it though, if you\u2019re into this kinda thing you\u2019re probably better off reading the X-men comics.  \u2605 Thank you to Edelweiss and the publisher for providing me with an ARC \u2605"}, {"userName": "Lindsay", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5328615-lindsay", "userReview": "Felicity lives in fear that the Peelers will discover her younger brother is Tainted and he will be ripped away from her. With both parents dead, she takes care of her brother by selling flowers in London's market. One day a carriage appears with two menacing men taking pictures of the poor residents trying to sell food, remedies, and items for their own survival. A brawl erupts between these men and her boyfriend/best friend Kit that results in Kit shot dead. Unbeknownst to her, Felicity discovers she is also Tainted when she channels her anger into attacking the two assailants, injuring one and killing another. She is hauled off to prison and next in line to be hanged when a mysterious man appears and offers her a way out. All she has to do is trust him and venture to Greybourne Academy where she will learn to harness her ability among other Tainted students.This is an intriguing and fresh addition to the YA industry. I enjoyed the story and didn't predict the two big reveals (halfway point I think and then the end). Regardless, there were still a few issues. The instant love between Julian and Felicity was absurd. They barely exchange words and interact and by the 60% mark they have their first kiss. From there Julian pretty much ignores her and then they kiss again towards the end. This story would have been stronger without a romance factor that way it would have solely focused on teamwork between top ranking agents at Greybourne, especially since the factor is teamwork is stressed so much.Another issue regards Felicity's lack of intelligence. Every time she sneaks away from Greybourne she is attacked by the Huntsmen (they abhor and hunt Tainted) and Julian (and sometimes classmates) always end up saving her. You would think after the fourth time she would learn her lesson about sneaking off but she never does, and the Huntsmen always find her. On one of her excursions she stupidly gives out the password to a professor that she meets so he can venture into Greybourne whenever he pleases to give Felicity insight about a proposed cure. And of course he is followed by Huntsmen and Greybourne is breached.The final issue regards Felicity's abilities. She taps into her powers once during the fight at the beginning, and then a tiny bit when she first meets Julian. She cannot harness it after that point and regularly gets beat up during sparring lessons with her classmates. About halfway through the book Julian takes her aside in attempt to help her out. She grasps onto her a power enough to barely lift up a huge potted plant, and then suddenly in the next chapter she is attacks a student during a sparing match and knocks him out. The point is, there isn't any practice of using her power. She goes from not knowing how to use it, to barely picking up a plant, to all of a sudden lethal.Game of Secrets is a mixture of Divergent, Harry Potter, and The Dark Knight so fans of those will definitely enjoy this one.I received an ARC from Edelweiss."}, {"userName": "Minx -The Genre Minx Book Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40042696-minx--the-genre-minx-book-reviews", "userReview": "I received a digital ARC of this novel courtesy of Edelweiss+ and Sky Pony Press in exchange for a honest and voluntary review.

But by half way through, this began to hit every trope/cliche in the YA genre (and not even creatively at that) and the writing began to feel rushed and simplistic through to the end. It felt as if the author spent a lot of time on the beginning and then hurried through the rest in order to get this published.Story: Surviving in the streets of Dickensensian White Chapel isn't easy for Felicity Cole; especially considering she and her brother are orphans and he has a fatal flaw: supernatural powers that would immediately see him mob murdered like her mother. When someone close to her is brutally murdered by an aristocrat, she loses control of her anger and discovers she has powers as well - physical ones. Hunted, imprisoned, she is saved by a mysterious benefactor and taken to a hidden academy to train to become an assassin and bodyguard to Queen and country. But Felicity only cares for being reunited with her young brother who may be walking the streets alone without her. Fortunately, a fellow aristrocratic student is hot and interested.I wish I could determine if it was lazy or just unsophisticated writing. But the tropes/cliches were painful:- unique snowflake with mysterious past no one tells her about and mysterious superpowers she will have to learn to use by herself because no one wants to help her despite it being in their best interest- Perfect bog standard overidealized love interest who inexplicably instaluvs her - super handsome, intelligent, in a position of respect, and 100% devoted only to her for no particular reason- Mean girl rival for melodrama so author can show 'spirit' by giving her comeuppances and cat fights- Perfect sweet best/friend maid who has the personality of a pansy but makes our gal look feisty- Girl does completely brain dead actions, constantly, that always results in trouble for everyone else and needing to be rescued - and no one seems to mind that it gets them nearly killed several times.- Girl had previous love interest who was murdered - does she think about him? Not more than \"I should be sad about Kit but the new boy makes me tingle and blush.\" Oh and the brother she's desperately trying to get back to? Pretty much forgotten while she's so busy with super hunk and mean girl.- Everyone puts new girl in positions of power for NO REASON - she's a moron, she screws everything up, she doesn't even care about those people. But hey, let's pick her for missions even though she doesn't have powers and over competent handsome boy even though she's proven several times to ruin missions.- Betrayal from within their rebel group! Who'd a thunk it? Could it be the nice sweet older guy??And then there are the logic holes about the worldbuilding. How no one seems to know anything about the 'tainted' except only a few yet everyone in London wants to kill them. Zero world building (why was Warwick photographing that day? Why does he want her? Why does the world hate tainted? What do the Hunters want? Why haven't they gained access to the academy before? etc. etc. etc. - don't expect answers this volume). She was supposedly raised in the slums but speaks perfect formal English - just missing some mannerisms like good curtseying that deportment school will fix?. Damn her father was a good English teacher! Her father was Greek - with the last name of...Cole? Something about Shakespeare and Marlowe - making her even MORE special. And don't get me started about the 'stunning' reveal of what the Tainted are - it was hard not to giggle derisively even for a YA book.Typically, I'd suggest this is a no-brain Summer read that is fast and easy. But the writing is so bad in the second half and the book so much in need of a rewrite that I just can't recommend Game of Secrets (even the title is generic and meaningless). It's a cut above many Harry Potter fanfictions - but that's the best I can say about it.

Maybe it's because of all the drama that inevitably follows, or the politics of the time, or maybe the way the steampunk genre always seems to be set in the Victorian era. This novel does not fall into the steampunk genre in any way, though. It's an historical fiction with some fantasy elements and, because every good historical fiction apparently needs it, romance as well. The romance was kind of...meh, but more on that later.Felicity Cole is a poor girl living in the slums of London trying to take care of herself and her little brother, Nate. It quickly becomes clear that both she and Nate are both Tainted--this book's derogatory term for someone possessing unexplained powers--and are pursued by both police specialized in hunting and extricating Tainted from normal society and those who wish to recruit them for some other greater good. You can probably guess which one Felicity \"chooses\" to turn toward to help her out.This started out pretty strong. However, as I got to the meat of the novel, it sort of stumbled around trying to find a straight course but not entirely getting there. Felicity is recruited by a secret Hogwarts-esque school that was started specifically for the Tainted to learn and control their gifts, and there she is subjected to a myriad of tropes that typically follow the \"new girl in school\" scenario, including, but not limited to: 1. the pretty but talented mean girl2. the mysteriously attractive and talented boy3. the maid best friend4. the teacher that hates her but also helps her, and5. all the secrets the staff are hiding.The book just kind of mashes all of these together in about 100 pages and then moves on to what should be the plot, which I couldn't really discern between the strange romance going on between Felicity and the mysteriously attractive and talented boy, Julian. I won't spoil anything here, but it's very....sudden, and not very subtle. So I guess we can add instalove to the list of tropes up there.Unfortunately, the worldbuilding is also very lackluster here: we're not given how the Tainted came to be until about 75% through, just points that they possess unimaginable powers and are looked down upon by the general masses. I am assuming that Ms. Foster withheld this kind of information for so long for some sort of shock effect or \"big twist\" at the end, but in the long run, it just makes the plot weak.I won't lie, I did enjoy this, especially the fight scenes, especially because those kinds of scenes involving people with weird powers like slowing time and superhuman speed can get kind of repetitive to the reader, but Ms. Foster does an excellent job of detailing just the right amount. The cliffhanger at the end left me a little bewildered, but I suppose that'll all be cleared up in the next book."}, {"userName": "Gabrielle", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8650677-gabrielle", "userReview": "I received this book from Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review.I really wanted to like this book. The premise sounded interesting and I thought that it could be a good pick me up for the fantasy genre that I needed. Sadly, this book didn't do any of that. It wasn't bad, but because it was such an okay book, I'm not fully sure how to put my thoughts into words, but I'll try.Within the first few pages, there's already action happening and people dying and whatnot, and normally I love being thrust into the action hoping afterwards things are explained. Things were not explained. The plot seemed to be moving too fast for the characters and the reader. It would jump from one place to the next to another place in the span of three pages but never offer an explanation. I understand the main character doesn't understand either, but after awhile you have to give some things away or the reader gets bored, like me. I needed to know things, but instead we got nothing. When you're 17 chapters into a book and nothing feels concrete, I think there's a problem.At least the writing was really simple and easy to get into. If I hadn't had so many problems with the plot, I would have loved this book strictly for the writing. There were definitely some world building holes, but with this being an ARC, I'm hoping those will be fixed before the book is released in July. The characters, mainly Felicity, were the other problems for me. I didn't like her. She was the definition of a Mary Sue character. There was just nothing about her that was wow. Julian, on the other hand, reminded me so much of Will from The Infernal Devices series that I had a moment of wondering. The two books are based in similar time periods so it could've just been a coincidence. I'm hoping parts of this book change because it could be a strong book, but urgh. I can't."}, {"userName": "Emilie", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30927053-emilie", "userReview": "I received a digital copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.The synopsis of this book sounded great, so I did not hesitate to download a review copy.
