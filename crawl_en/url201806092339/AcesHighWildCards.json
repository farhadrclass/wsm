I nearly stopped reading it several times, but cajoled myself into continuing each time because I hoped the next story would be better. It never was.In short, I hated every character in this anthology except perhaps the Turtle/Tom and Croyd. Their stories were the only ones I read with at least some interest. Fortunato, on the other hand, kept showing up in every other story, and each time he was mentioned I wished he would just disappear forever. I hated him in the first volume and I hated him here. His \"love\" for Eileen was entirely unbelievable and it seemed like women were objects to him (really the trend of most of the volume, to be fair), so I felt no sense of loss when Eileen met her incredibly unfortunate end. In By Lost Ways and Half Past Dead, when Fortunato started referring to Dr Tachyon as \"space faggot\" both internally and in dialogue with another character, I dare say I saw red - not because I like Tachyon (faaaaar far from it) but because it just wasn't right. I don't believe the story's intention was to make me accept it somehow or agree to it, but all it actually did was make me wish Fortunato died in some horrible accident, perhaps something involving getting fed into a wood chipper posthumously (\u00e0 la Fargo).The anthology's overarching plot was terrible. I hate gross aliens and I hate cultists, and I got both of those in spades (har har see what I did there) in this volume. The only upshot was that towards the end of the book most of the cultists were killed or arrested in an ace raid. There was also a lot of weird sex, almost all of it unnecessary (like the sex scene on the Takisian spaceship in Relative Difficulties; and don't get me started on the scifi elements of the volume...). Some of it was even exceptionally revolting (the Astronomer's sex scene during the ritual sacrifice from If Looks Could Kill, anyone?). I read most of the volume with a look of disgust on my face. I'm afraid it might stick. I'm only giving this series one last shot because I bought the third volume before I even started reading this one. I could never have guessed how dreadful it would turn out to be, so my hopes will be extremely low for the third volume. I certainly would not recommend this instalment of the Wild Cards series to anyone. No one deserves to have it inflicted upon them. If you enjoyed this volume: why don't you respect yourself?"}, {"userName": "R.", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/184928-r", "userReview": "Christmas Gift, 1987.

The beginnings of the Masonic twats in robes were shown when Fortunato discovered his powers and killed one of their members if I remember correctly. The end of the whole story will be in the third collection, although this one also has a completed stand-alone plot.I quite liked it, although I thought that the masonics were a bit ill-defined, and shoehorned in to provide an opponent for the others to fight against.Also, the writer of Brennan still doesn't have a clue about how archery works...If he was good enough to look up the concept of a compound bow, he might also have considered that it is pretty much physically impossible to sling such a bow across your torso. You can also not lean on it, unless you're very short, because they're no more than 3 ft tall. They also cannot be seperated into parts fir transport, or strung and unstrung without considerable effort and material. Such thing just irritate me :p (at least he didn't shoot 6 arrows in 9 seconds this time...)Aanywhooo...I liked Croyd's appearance in this one. He's one of my favourite Wild Cards characters, as he is quite a nice guy, who may do questionable things to get by, but is never really evil. Here, he gets paid by Jube to steal the body and belongings of a dead alien spy from a morgue. In the course of this, pretty much everything goes wrong, the body is lost, dumped, stolen and otherwise mistreated several times, and in the end arrives at Jube's in a large jar and several doggie-bags...Another important story element is the hunt for an alien artifact that can teleport people away and generally do energy things. It appears like a black bowling ball, and it intially snatched by a deranged baglady, who uses it to displace everybody who gets near. Both the Masons and the goodies are trying to get it. On the side of the goodies, it's mostly Tachyon, the Turtle, and Mark Meadows, who has created drugs which allow him to turn into a collection of different aces for a short time, mostly to the confusion of everyone around. Meanwhile, the artifact changes hands from the baglady to a bunch of young thugs to Tachs family (not a good thing).In general: 8/10"}, {"userName": "Leo (Rahien Sorei)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18311716-leo-rahien-sorei", "userReview": "This installment of the Wild Cards saga was much more cohesive than Wild Cards. We followed only a few characters whom we got to know very well - Jube, Dr. Tachyon and some other old faces like The Great and Powerful Turtle. Except everyone who we encountered at the height of their popularity (or stigma) has declined somewhat. We also aw new faces, who were a treat to meet - Captain Trips and all his friends, Water Lily Jane and Modular Man. I loved Captain Trips as a byproduct of quiet little Brian Meadows from book 1 - plus his alternate personas were super cool, and even better, brought on by ACID TRIPS. What's not to like about that? I enjoyed reading this book, but not as much as the first - I had really enjoyed the alternate history of the aces and jokers' world. In this book, the controversy seems to have died down, and the Swarm becomes the focus - the Masons were a great touch though, I really wanted the Astronomer to get bitch-slapped by karma. On a whole, read it you won't regret it. I do regret that I have to wait for the new edition of Jokers Wild."}, {"userName": "Calamity", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1820816-calamity", "userReview": "This time around the Wild Card universe takes us trough an alien invasion, giving clever nods to ancient mythology and even the ctulhu mythos, while introducing several new characters like Walrus, the Astronomer, Dr. Tachyon\u2019s family and their sentient ships (Hellcat and Baby), Captain Trips, Modular Man, and many others.I was again mesmerized by this alternate Earth that George R R Martin and his friends created, even if it did not amaze me as much as the first volume, it felt as if I was reading about old friends. Jokertown in itself is gripping, a city within the city, where everything seems to happen, a town of endless possibilities. This second volume read more like a pulp adventure, with alien invaders and a secret society of villains that\u2019s trying to rule the world against the good guys that are always saving the day in the nick of time. Yet it was good, interesting and I\u2019m certain I\u2019m gonna keep reading the series.

The \"cast list\" of players is still being expanded but the interesting thing here is that the main challenge is from another outside source - this time the \"swarm\" and extra terrestrial threat that requires everyone to join together and temporarily put aside the differences and work together. I must admit that even though the storyline was fun - carrying on the tradition of the super hero feel - I did get the feeling that the series is still finding its stride and getting used to it self. There were still a lot of explanations of what was going on and why - almost as much to convince themselves as there were to convince the reader for example. That said it still has a fresh feel and does not fall in to the clich\u00e9s you would expect to trip such a project up as this (does that reflect the superior guidance of Mr Martin I wonder)"}, {"userName": "Baal Of", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1720603-baal-of", "userReview": "I am really enjoying this series. This volume puts together a slightly tighter story arc than the previous book, with good collaboration between the various authors. There are some new characters introduced, with interesting backgrounds. The Swarm as a primary villain of one of the major arcs is pretty cool, especially the way it adapts continuously to the changing conditions, constantly probing for ways to get established on Earth. The other primary villain, the Astronomer, is very nasty in the best way. I still don't like Fortunato, and I'm not sure I ever will, although this may be intentional on the author's part. Roger Zelazny and Walter Jon Williams deliver my favorite sections, but I'm biased already, since Zelazny is a long time favorite since high school. This volume seemed a bit less grim than the previous one, but there is still a lot of violence, death, and destruction."}, {"userName": "Jeff Harris", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53628779-jeff-harris", "userReview": "Another solid Wild Cards anthology. The narrator for this books does a nice job of staying consistent with the various characters, which can be the downfall of many good \"voices\".

The Great and Powerful Turtle's backstory was wonderful and I thought his journey in this anthology was what made it all worthwhile."}, {"userName": "Shannon Appelcline", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10160415-shannon-appelcline", "userReview": "Fortunato's story of TIAMAT was one of the most obvious dangling loose ends from the original Wild Cards volume, so it's great to see that it was all a setup for this second volume.However, what's greatest about this volume is how successfully it interweaves multiple short stories to create a ... mosaic (though the book doesn't use that term in its early printings). This was a step beyond what Thieves World had done, creating not just a coherent universe, but also a coherent story.This second volume is also quite impressive for how it melds together mysticism and science-fiction. It's all in the eyes of the beholder ... which was probably a great model for *how* to fit together this disparate stories by these disparate creators.Pennies from Hell (Shiner: Fortunato). Fortunato does mystic things. Fortunato does sexual things. Tragedy strikes. Fortunato fails to conquer TIAMAT. The biggest problem with this story is that it feels like a rehash of the Fortunato story from the first volume. It's a nice setup for the rising power of TIAMAT, but not very original. Also, not very deep. [5+/10].Jube (Martin: Jube). When Jube appears in the first part of his story, he looks to be a take on Thieves' World's Hakiem: the main editor of the anthology uses a storyteller character to help set the stage and show the background of his shared world. But then Martin pulls the rug out from under us by revealing that Jube is an alien ... the other part of the tapestry that makes up Aces High. Afterward, he very successfully uses Jube to tie together the various parts of the novel into a coherent whole. In the end, this is just an interstitial bit of connectivity, but it's well done and well characterized [6+/10].Ashes to Ashes (Zelazny: Croyd). This minor caper could have been dull if Zelazny didn't play it for laughs so successfully. Instead it becomes another magnificent tale of the Sleeper [7+/10].Unto the Sixth Generation (Williams: Modular Man). Williams creates another great character here in Modular Man. He's neat because he's another super character that isn't a Wild Card (like Yeoman from the previous volume), but he's also got great characterization as he tries to balance his own evolving self with his creator's asinine demands. The first half of the story itself is also impressive because it's greatly epic: a space invasion of Earth held off by numerous Aces. It tells you the sort of thing you can expect in the Wild Cards books, and the scope is magnificent. [7+/10]. Unfortunately, the second half is anticlimactic, with Modular Man fading into the background in the face of the Masons and the whole quest for a bag lady with a magic bag not making much sense (yet). [5/10] However, I do admire the decision to break this story in two (or four or five), allowing it to interweave with the rest of the novel, much like the \"Jube\" story, as part of a mosaic.If Looks Could Kill (Simons: Demise). When I was young and read this for the first time, I found Demise and his ability to kill with a look terrifying. I dunno if I was scared for the characters of the Wild Card universe, or just myself. In any case, Simons does a good job of making Demise a terrifying villain, and simultaneously makes the Astronomer quite creepy \u2014 with the latter character connecting this story into the larger narrative. But the plot? I'm not convinced that \"bad guy decides to join up with even worse people\" is really much of a story [5/10].Winter's Chill (Martin: Turtle). Martin is very deft with this whole shared-world-anthology idea. He manages to tie his Turtle story into the Swarm invasion, and even has Tom play one round in the catch-the-macguffin plot. However at its heart it's a character story, and it's a pretty wonderful one. I can forgive Tom refusing to tell the secret that might have made everything all right, because he had decades of keeping to himself. And that secret leads us into a wonderfully melancholy tale of a mature hero ... who is alone. Great stuff! [8/10]Relative Difficulties (Snodgrass: Tachyon, Turtle, Captain Trips). This story isn't really related to the big Swarm plot, but it gets by fine through references and the fact that it's another space story. However, where it really excels is in detailing the universe of the Wild Cards and in developing its characters. Its great to see the Takysians for the first time and learn a bit about their culture. It's also really nice that Snodgrass replies to Martin's story in the first volume by expanding and deepening the friendship between Tachy and Turtle. Captain Trips is also used to fun effect here: it's pretty amazing that Snodgrass got to be the one revealing how Trips' powers worked. Overall, this emotional, character-based story makes it clear how closely and well the Wild Cards writers worked together in these early days [7+/10].With a Little Help from My Friends (Mil\u00e1n: Tachyon, Captain Trips). It's surprising to see Mil\u00e1n write another Tachyon story, with his own Captain Trips playing a supporting role. It's a perfectly fine Tachyon story that continues on from \"Relative Difficulties\" while still maintaining its own existence as a standalone short story with a beginning, middle, and end. I don't think any of the characters come into as strong of focus as in Snodgrass' story, but this is still an interesting and meaningful episode in Wild Cards [7/10].By Lost Ways (Cadigan: Water Lily). This story is obviously meant to be another major climax for the book, setting back the Masons who have been sneaking around the background since Wild Cards I. Setting up multiple plot points in the book (swarm invasion, bowling ball search, Masons, TIAMAT) and giving multiple authors the ability to write important tales is nice model. Unfortunately, this feels more like a anti-climax. The problem is that Cadigan is just trying to do too much: introduce Water Lily; characterize the Masons; give Fortunato a chance for vengeance; bring down the Masons. The result is very awkwardly plotted and goes from 0 to 60 in the span of a paragraph or two. [5/10]Half Past Dead (Miller: Yeoman). It's a bit surprising to close the threat of the Swarm Mother with a \"Green Arrow\" story, but that's exactly what Aces High does. And, it's a pretty good story that doesn't feel out of place. I'm not convinced that we learn much new about Yeoman (or Fortunato or Tachyon), but this is a nice adventure with a great, appropriate ending [7+/10].When comparing this to Thieves World, it's obvious how much George R.R. Martin is pushing the shared-world anthology into the future. Thieves World never achieved this sort of tight continuity, but here Martin does an amazing job of both corralling the writers to tell a consistent story while also allowing them to each shine in your own way.There are still bumps along the way. The constantly changing set of goals (Masons, black globes, Swarm) feels a bit artificial. With a few exceptions (the first half of the Modular Man story & the main Turtle story), the stories also don't excel in the way they did in the first Wild Cards anthology. Still, this is a fun \"novel\" that nicely blends the creativity of many fine authors.Oh, I wish these Wild Cards novels had meaningful names though. Aces High just barely manages to remind you it's about the threat from space, but it'd get lost among the dozens of very similar names over the years."}, {"userName": "Alicja G\u00f3rska", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38334018-alicja-g-rska", "userReview": "http://recenzent.com.pl/1/recenzja-ks...W alternatywnej rzeczywisto\u015bci II wojna \u015bwiatowa wygl\u0105da\u0142a zupe\u0142nie inaczej.

A book that puts the two together is cheating and there was no way I could escape it's grasp. So when I set out to the second one I was worried that the story itself might not hold my interest.Man was I wrong on that one.The true strength of these books, besides their concept, is the way that each character is treated like a main character. Take Jube for example. The walrus joker who sold papers and told bad jokes, I mean at best he is a side character, at worst a punchline.Well, no he in the center of his own adventure, his own life and once you step into his story you see how he is indeed, a main charter. That alone is off the charts cool but wait, there is more.The way the individual stories weave and move to tell a much larger meta plot, something that is pure genius and will not be truly appreciated for decades when Marvel builds a film industry on it. These books are phases unto themselves and that alone make reading them amazing. Not just one story about one person, these early novels were truly an ensemble world that made you feel like the whole thing was living and breathing around you.There are some clunkers of course but that is the genius about a shared universe. Is Thor 2 weak? Make up for it with Winter Solider, it will all even out in the end. These books age well, they still tell an incredible story and I wish Game of Thrones would go away already so he can start working on this series for TV. Because I assure you, there will be some Buzzfeed article on how George RR Martin is using the \"Marvel way\" to sell his book series. Read these books now, learn the truth.The Marvel way is the Wild Cards way."}, {"userName": "Rob", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3359801-rob", "userReview": "...I guess this volume signals change for the reader. It exchanges some variety and distinctness found in the first volume for a more solid story arc in the second. I don't think the series would have lasted twenty-five years and produced twenty-one volumes (I understand there is a twenty-second in the works continuing the \nFort Freak\n story line). It also shifts the focus a bit from the Aces and Jokers to the various alien races that inhabit the Wild cards universe. Maybe doing both at once is a bit too much of a good thing but who can resits a dose of horrific extraterrestrials, superheroes who are both tragic and heroic (and never end up with the girl) and some fine over the top fighting scenes to keep the adrenaline going? Aces High is both massively entertaining and a solid foundation for the rest of the series.

In this second book of the series, the characters introduced in the first book begin to come together to save the world from multiple threats, including those history made for us but also new ones due, in part, to the problems created by the wild card virus. The virus, introduced in the first book as an experiment on humans by an alien race, has produced superheroes, grossly disfigured people, combinations of the two, and none of the above, which is passed on through the generations.

Jokern, verachtet vom Rest der Welt. Die restlichen 1 % wurden zu Assen, geliebt und gef\u00fcrchtet. Ihre F\u00e4higkeiten sind ohnegleichen.Doch pl\u00f6tzlich m\u00fcssen alle zusammenarbeiten, denn eine au\u00dferirdische Bedrohung ist auf dem Weg zur Erde, um alles zu vernichten. Die Schwarmmutter will die Herrschaft \u00fcbernehmen - und keine Macht konnte sie je aufhalten.Die Wild Cards-Reihe ist dem Superhelden- und Alterntivweltgeschichten-Genre zuzuordnen. Dies sind Geschichten, die in einer Welt spielen, \"...in der der Lauf der Weltgeschichte irgendwann (am sog. Divergenzpunkt) von dem uns Bekannten abgewichen ist...\" (Quelle: wikipedia). George R.R. Martin, der zusammen mit anderen Autoren aus New Mexico die Serie Wild Cards ins Leben gerufen hat, ist auch der Herausgeber. Der sog. \"Mosaikroman\" zeichnet sich dadurch aus, das verschiedene Charaktere eine zusammenh\u00e4ngende Handlung abdecken, erz\u00e4hlt in einzelnen Kurzgeschichten von verschiedenen Autoren (Quelle: wikipedia).Hier befinden wir uns in den 40er Jahren, ein Virus ver\u00e4ndert die Menschheit. Viele werden get\u00f6tet, einige werden zu Jokern (Mutationen) und einige Wenige werden zu sog. Assen, die ihre F\u00e4higkeiten meist f\u00fcr Gutes einsetzen.In \"Der Schwarm\" wird nun von der ersten Generation erz\u00e4hlt, von den Menschen, die unmittelbar von dem Virus betroffen sind. Eine Bedrohung aus dem All macht den Bewohnern der Erde zu schaffen. Die Schwarmmutter l\u00e4sst ihre \"Kinder\" frei, um die Erde einzunehmen. Die Asse machen sich auf zur Bek\u00e4mpfung, doch auch die Joker m\u00fcssen ihren Teil dazu beitragen.Und so schlie\u00dfen sich die verhassten Joker mit den Assen und den Normalsterblichen zusammen.Doch nicht jeder arbeitet so, wie von ihm erwartet wird. Und dann sind da noch die \u00e4gyptischen Freimaurer, die ein W\u00f6rtchen mitreden wollen.Immer wenn ich ein neues Buch der Wild Cards-Reihe anfange, habe ich Schwierigkeiten, in die Geschichte hineinzufinden. Es wirkt immer alles so wirr und unkoordiniert, was aber auch daran liegt, dass an dem Werk ja mehrere Autoren mitwirken. Und so lernt man viele neue Charaktere kennen bzw. man bekommt suggeriert, dass man sie schon kennen w\u00fcrde. Bis man richtig versteht, um was es eigentlich geht, ist meist schon das erste Drittel rum.Wer sich auf das Wild Cards-Universums einl\u00e4sst, erlebt eine Komplexit\u00e4t ohnegleichen. Unendliche M\u00f6glichkeiten ergeben sich, die von den Autoren geschickt ausgenutzt werden. Die F\u00e4higkeiten der Asse sind perfekt auf die Bedrohung abgestimmt. Sei es Telekinese, \u00dcbertragung des Bewusstseins durch Sex, Fliegen, Teleportation, Bilden von Hologrammen, Gedankenbeeinflussung, Verwandlung in verschiedene Dinosaurier etc. Alles scheint ausgereift und stimmig, bringt aber noch mehr Verwirrung rein.Wenn man bedenkt, dass an dem Projekt so einige Autoren beteiligt sind, k\u00f6nnte man meinen, dass am Ende totaler Quatsch rauskommt und doch ist dem nicht so.Selbst vom Schreibstil her ist es fast nicht m\u00f6glich - zumindest mir - Unterschiede festzustellen.Und trotzdem war ich letztendlich nicht so zufrieden wie bei den anderen B\u00e4nden. Es hat das gewisse Etwas gefehlt. Zwar steht die Bedrohung durch Au\u00dferirdische im Vordergrund. Und doch nimmt diese keinen gro\u00dfen Raum ein. Die Bek\u00e4mpfung wirkt unspektakul\u00e4r. Es geht haupts\u00e4chlich um Joker und deren Machenschaften. Kaum ein Ass kommt zur Sprache oder es werden ihnen gr\u00f6\u00dfere Szenen gewidmet.Neben der Hauptstory geht es um viele kleine Machenschaften, die zwar immer wieder zum eigentlichen Thema f\u00fchren, aber doch den Anschein erwecken, wichtiger zu sein.Der Faszination tut dies fast keinen Abbruch, obwohl ich ca. in der H\u00e4lfte des Buches einen Durchh\u00e4nger hatte und erst mal etwas anderes lesen musste.Die Autoren haben sich etwas mit anderen Dingen verzettelt und Nebencharaktere eine gr\u00f6\u00dfere Rolle zugewiesen, obwohl dies in meinen Augen nicht notwendig war.Wild Cards ist so ein Ding f\u00fcr sich. Entweder man liebt es oder man mag es nicht. Ich pers\u00f6nlich bin jedoch froh, diese Reihe f\u00fcr mich entdeckt zu haben. Erw\u00e4hnen m\u00f6chte ich, dass mitten in der Reihe die Covergestaltung ge\u00e4ndert wurde. Leider passen nun Band 1 und Band 2 optisch nicht mehr zueinander. Fazit:Ich bleibe der Reihe treu."}, {"userName": "Craig Childs", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4512914-craig-childs", "userReview": "I was somewhat disappointed in Aces High after Wild Cards I had surpassed my expectations. I enjoyed some of the new characters--especially Dinosaur Kid, Water Lily, and the four new incarnations of Captain Trips--but the overall quality of many of the stories was lacking. Part of the problem was too many overlapping story lines--an alien invasion of earth, a Takisian succession dispute, a chase after a black hole-powered singularity shifter, and an occult society of Masons trying to call down a mythological god to take over the world. Individual stories were forced to move too many players across the board from Point A to Point B in order to feed an overall arc, rather than letting each story play itself out in an organic way to serve its point of view characters.On the other hand, maybe the root problem was that I just found the Mason society to be irritating and uninteresting. Here are the individual story reviews: \u201cPennies from Hell\u201d by Lewis Shiner \u2013 Using a few clues planted in his previous story (\u201cThe Long, Dark Night of Fortunado\u201d), the ace whose power is fueled by tantric sex tracks down a group of occultic Masons dedicated to bringing an ancient Sumerian deity named Tiamet to earth. This story sets up one of the vital plotlines of the book, but it seemed like a lackluster outing for one of my favorite characters.\u201cJube\u201d by George R.R. Martin \u2013 This is not so much a story as a series of interstitial scenes interspersed throughout the book to tie many of the other stories together into a unified whole. Jube is the Walrus joker mentioned but not named in Wild Cards I. Turns out, Jube is actually an alien, not a joker, and he has the key to technology that can save earth from an imminent alien invasion.\u201cUnto the Sixth Generation\u201d by Walter Jon Williams\u2014An alien swarm attacks earth and is repelled when all the aces gather (like the Avengers!) to destroy it. Meanwhile, a mad joker scientist living in New York creates an android named Modular Man who helps the aces. The Masons and Modular Man all hunt an alien singularity device that may (or may not) stop the aliens and may (or may not) summon Tiamet. If this plot sounds disjointed and somewhat reliant on coincidence, it is. The story is broken up into four parts with other stories mixed in between.\u201cAshes to Ashes\u201d by Roger Zelazny \u2013 The Sleeper returns in this broad comedy. Croyd is hired to rob the corpse of a dead alien\u2014one of Jube\u2019s associates\u2014but a series of nearly slapstick digressions caused the body to be slowly lost and destroyed piece by piece.\u201cIf Looks Could Kill\u201d by Walton Simons \u2013 A telepathic but psychologically damaged ace is recruited by the Masons and their shadowy leader, known as The Astronomer. This story relies on scenes of ritual sacrifice and violent rape, but the plot is rather lame.\u201cWinter Chill\u201d by George R. R. Martin \u2013We catch up with Tom Tudbury twenty years after he became Turtle and find that living as a secret hero has ruined his chances with the woman he loves. This is the first strong, character-driven story in the book. However, I had a major quibble with one significant plot point: In a world that has been living with the virus for over 40 years, I think everyone would understand how the virus passes from parent to child\u2014when it is dominate or recessive, and how someone can be a carrier without showing symptoms. This would be part of the fabric of everyday life and relationships, not secret information shared by Dr. Tachyon on the roof of a building in a clandestine meeting. \u201cRelative Difficulties\u201d by Melinda Snodgrass \u2013 Fearing the planet will soon fall to the Swarm, the Takisians arrive on earth to collect ace specimens for further study and also recruit Dr. Tachyon as a pawn in a family power struggle. Readers learn a great deal about the doctor\u2019s background and culture. Mark Meadows returns and the full range of his ace powers is revealed\u2014he is Captain Trips, who uses various drugs to bring forth a host of multiple personas and bodies. All of a sudden, he is a more interesting and versatile character than when he was simply Radical. Turtle has a redemption arc, and even Kiet is brought into the forefront of the narrative in a surprising way. This story is funny, exciting, and layered.\u201cWith a Little Help From His Friends\u201d by Victor Milan \u2013 This is essentially a continuation of the previous story. Dr. Tachyon and Captain Trips investigate the death of an eccentric scientist, which leads to evidence the alien swarm is preparing a second wave of attack, this time possibly aided by Tachyon\u2019s relatives. \"By Lost Ways\" by Pat Cadigan -- Water Lily is an interesting addition to the pantheon, an impressionable young woman with an ability to manipulate water and a pesky habit of killing people she does not like by sucking all the moisture out of their bodies. Unfortunately, we do not get to see too much of her because this story expends a lot of its energy gathering all the various Masonic bad guys into one place, so the aces can defeat them and close out this subplot.\"Mr. Koyama's Comet\" by Walter Jon Williams -- A well-told tale of an amateur astronomer whose life's desire is to discover a new comet, but he only succeeds in establishing the position of the Swarm ship. \"Half Past Dead\" by John J. Miller -- Yeoman teams up with Fortunado, Dr. Tachyon, and Mai to infiltrate the Swarm Mother ship and save the planet. Fortunado's unique properties are underused, but otherwise this is a fun engaging tale. Mai's character gets an especially appropriate sendoff, and I hope to see her again to find out what happened after the alien ship left our orbit."}, {"userName": "Adam Whitehead", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5866785-adam-whitehead", "userReview": "The world has been divided by the wild card virus: the unaffected, the deformed \"jokers\" and the super-powered \"aces\". All have their own agendas, some darker than others, but all are threatened by the arrival of the alien Swarm. As Earth comes under concerted attack by the creatures, several of Earth's own alien allies (such as Dr. Tachyon) help lead a defence. But destroying the Swarm Mother may be impossible as a cult of sympathisers leap to her defence...After the original Wild Cards focused on forty years of alternate history with the jokers and aces facing discrimination, political manipulation and questions over their loyalties, it's a bit of a tonal shift to follow that up with a full-scale alien invasion of Earth. Yet this kind of variety is what has kept the Wild Cards series fun and why it's still going thirty years after its creation. We know aliens exist in the setting - the wild card virus itself came from Takis - so it's fairly logical to see the aces and jokers joining forces to take on the menace.There are of course complications. Unlike most superhero settings, Wild Cards doesn't hold much truck with big superteams. Aces tend to do their own thing, only joining forces when absolutely necessary. For most of its length, Aces High deals with several prominent aces and jokers (Tachyon, the Turtle, Jube the Walrus, Kid Dinosaur, Modular Man and Fortunato, with a few appearances by Croyd the Sleeper) tackling apparently unrelated issues relating to the Swarm and a Masonic cult before they realise how their individual threads link up, and there is the inevitable big showdown.The stories that make up the book come from some of the bigger names in 1980s science fiction and fantasy: George R.R. Martin, Pat Cadigan, Walter Jon Williams, Melinda Snodgrass and Roger Zelazny are the big-hitters, but the rest are no slouches either. The stories vary from big, epic war stories as the Swarm invades in force to smaller-scaled tales of back-alley hustlings in Jokertown to things inbetween. They are all excellent, although it sometimes feels like you're only getting snapshots of the action. The Turtle gets a big, interesting storyline and then disappears off-page for a hundred-odd pages, during which time clearly some other stuff goes down, and suddenly he shows up for the big finale.This is a recurring issue with these kind of shared worlds, the nagging sense that you are not getting the full story and having to infer that some big story-critical moments have taken place off-page. But it's not too distracting and is made up for the fact that each writer is clearly having immense fun creating and crafting their characters and taking their storylines forwards. The framing stories, \"Jube\" and \"Unto the Sixth Generation\", do a good job of keeping the larger over-arcing story on track.The book builds to a big climax which is satisfying from an action and character perspective. But it's clear that although the aces have won a major victory over the Swarm Mother, they have neglected to account for her human minions. That's going to come back to bite them, quite hard, in the third book in the series.Aces High (****) is a fine addition to the Wild Cards universe and a compelling follow-up to the original book."}, {"userName": "Nicol", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56297219-nicol", "userReview": "Y estamos en el universo Wild Cards 10 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s (y la original duro unos 30 a\u00f1os... as\u00ed que... 40 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s del D\u00eda 0, en 1946).

The series is written by a collective rather than a single author. Whilst the first book was all about introducing the universe and some of it's characters, this one tells a more concise story. The Earth is threatened by the Swarm Mother and her Swarm and those with powers need to come together to defeat it. Like the previous book, it's a series of short stories though for the most part they are more closely linked here. It does feel a bit disjointed though with some stories leaning away from the main story. For me it doesn't quite work as it's not really a series of short stories like the previous volume but neither is it a novel. It's reads like an author wrote a story but kept getting distracted during it. I liked the main plot though and maybe that's why I became a little frustrated about stories which drifted away from it. The Swarm makes for a good threat and it's fun so see our characters fighting it. I was less keen on the Masons subplot which felt like it was trying to be clever and magical but wasn't succeeding. The book does a really good job with some of the universe's character. Dr. Tachyon appears a lot and we meet more of his species, the Turtle appears a few times and has an interesting story and Croyd pops up occasionally too. The book introduces several new character including Modular Man, a robot, and Jube, an alien living on Earth in the guise of a Joker who looks like a blue walrus. I think with any short story collection you get ups and downs as inevitably some stories are better than others. For the most part though Martin is a good editor and directs his authors to tell a good story, full of lots of great characters. Personally I would have cut a story or two from the final third of the book when the main plot started to drift away but generally I really enjoyed another trip into the Wild Cards universe."}], "description": "30 years later, the victims of the gene-altering 'Wild Cards' virus face a new nightmare. From the far reaches of space comes The Swarm, a deadly menace that could very will destroy the planet. Aces and Jokers must form an uneasy alliance and prepare for a battle they must not lose. When a group of SF's most imaginative writers discovered they shared a secret love of the larger-than-life heroes of the four-colour comics and Saturday matinee serials, they gave each other a challenge: What would our world be like if these superhuman heroes and villains had been real flesh-and-blood men and women who lived through this century's most turbulent history? In WILD CARDS 2, the year is 1970. The place is New York City, home of Aces High, the glamourous lounge atop the Empire State Building, and Jokertown, the squalid residence of the city's underclass. The victims of the Wild Card Virus are no longer new and strange, but neither are they accepted by a world that still fears them. But as the '80s dawn, all eyes are drwn to the skies, and the Wild Cards may be the planet's only hope, as an abomination called the Swarm arrives to threaten Earth.", "title": "Aces High\n      \n          (Wild Cards #2)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91976.Aces_High", "average": 3.86, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1171239722l/91976.jpg", "reviews": 192, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/346732.George_R_R_Martin", "name": "George R.R.
