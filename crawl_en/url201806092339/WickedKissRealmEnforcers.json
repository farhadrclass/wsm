Do you want another for good measure?\" -Adam and Tori Wicked Kiss, the 4th book in the Realm Enforcers series by Rebecca Zanetti, was awesome. I love me some Rebecca Zanetti. She is one of my top 5 favorite authors and she never fails to deliver amazing action packed reads with sexy heroes, and sassy heroines. I have been looking forward to Adam's book since Wicked Burn. Adam and Tori had major sparks in the last book and I knew they would be smoking hot together!\"You challenge me again, and I'll meet it. I won't stop until you're begging.\"-Adam\n\"You still haven't told me why you left the cabin when I specifically told you to stay there.\" Her chin dropped, and her eyebrows lifted, giving her the most smart-ass expression he'd ever seen. \"I guess the simplest answer is that I don't fucking take orders from you.\"-Adam and ToriAdam was all cold logic and strategy so it was fun to see him burn hot for Tori. Adam was all about smarts, calm, control, and following the rules. Things were black and white for him no gray areas until Tori. She made him feel alive. I loved how he would go from calm Mr. cold logic to total badass if someone dared to hurt his Tori! Tori was very cute. She was sassy and wild but she had some daddy issues. I loved that Tori wasn't super tough but she was brave. I also loved her strange enhancement. In this world enhanced human women can be mates to vampires, demons, witches, etc. Most enhancements in this series and the Dark Protector series have been things like empath, telekinesis, Second sight, or other psychic abilities, but Tori's ability was unique and I liked that it was different.  \"Ah, Victoria, you sweet woman. I just wanted to play a little. Make you needy. Now you're going to beg, and it's going to be the way I want. Not the measly little 'please' you gave me the other night.\" He scraped the late-evening shadow on his jaw down her sensitive neck. \"By the end of the night, I'll fucking own you.\"-Adam\n\u201cYou want me?\u201d \u201cAye,\u201d he said, his eyes burning. \u201cThen take me.\u201d-Tori and AdamWild Tori and reserved Adam together were like fire and ice. Tori really got under Adam's skin. She made him feel so much. She got him to be playful, and she just really brought his character to life. Adam and Tori really complemented each other. Just like Tori got Adam to loosen up a little and live, Adam tamed Tori. He believed in her and supported her. He helped her calm her powers and he loved her for who she was. I loved getting to see the Dunne gang again, including Bren and Jase. Dage (The king from DP) was in this book and I loved every moment with the King! I would have loved more of the Dark Protector gang because I love and miss them so damn much, but I also love getting to know the witches of the Realm better too. The plot in this book was fast pace and full of action. The smexy time was yummy. Rebecca Zanetti also gave us readers more yummy Bear who is having some health issues and I can't wait for his book!!\"Yes. Dead wrong. I'm the best thing that ever happened to you. I make you laugh.

At first glance you would assume that Tori and Adam could not be more wrong for each other but as the story develops you see how they truly complement each others personalities. They balance each other. I really liked them both which is rare for me since usually either the h or H will shine more, but I didn't think that was the case in this book. The story it's self was very fast paced with lots of action which I always enjoy. I wouldn't recommend reading this one if you haven't read the first 3 because this wraps up a bunch of the storylines from previous books and it might be confusing.I'm very excited for the next book, finally Bear! I can't wait for his story, and I'm so happy there is only a few weeks between this release and Wicked Bite. Double the summer goodness ;)P.S. I will say that I'm still not crazy about this cover, I don't know if its the green or the cover model or what but not loving it.

I love the Dunne boys, I suppose my gripes about them all being pretty much the same in personality and behavior could be explained in the fact that they are brothers, but then the Kayrs brothers didn\u2019t feel like carbon copies of each other so my thoughts do still have merit.\"Family is a pain in the ass.\"Griping aside this series is probably the best that Zanetti has produced since DP was wound up, but once again I find myself struggling to like the female lead, Tori Monzelle was a struggle to get along with pretty much from the get-go. Rebecca has a habit of making her heroines sassy, mouthy and over-the-top independent in her novels, nothing I have a complaint about, but sometimes it just errs into the column of stupidity instead of confidence, and arrogance over sassy. And funnily enough this is exactly the same problem I had with her sister Lex in the first book from this series; Wicked Ride. \"You\u2019re in danger so take this seriously.\"That said this was a rip-roaring ride from the start, the Dunne family have all pretty much been banished from the Coven Nine as enforcers and in their roles on the council, now being run by Peter Gallagher, there is something sketchy about the guy, and his motivations for the decisions he is making in the councils name, and finding the evidence against him is firmly Adam\u2019s plan, especially as his brothers have both been removed from their roles as Enforcers alongside him.\"You\u2019re kind of an all-in or all-out kind of guy.\"There is a lot going on in this book, the repercussions from its predecessor still very much playing out with Simone in hiding, the brothers have gone to ground, and Adam has been tasked with keeping Tori safe. Whats starts out as dislike soon morphs to attraction and off-the-charts chemistry, something which both of them try to ignore initially, but then as is usual with this authors males Adam uses it in his attempts to bring Tori to heel.\"Your taming has begun.\"The bigger part of the story playing out was what kept me entertained the most, again this is a series, that because of its origins from the Dark Protectors that I know most of the characters from really well now, so it\u2019s basically like catching up with old friends. We step a little closer into working out who is responsible for the production and distribution of the drug that is killing humans and witches alike, as well as progress a little further on some of the other side plots too, which pleases me greatly.\"We barely had the chance to enjoy the peace\u2026\"Another thing that pleases me is that the next book Wicked Bite is due for release in a few weeks, so we get to move straight onto Bear\u2019s book without a massive break. Excited much! This isn\u2019t a negative review, and I don\u2019t want it to be seen as one, the points raised above are meant as constructive feedback, and obviously my opinions are just my own. I am a huge fan of this author, she is one of a very small number who I have read every book that they have released, and considering the number, that is a compliment in itself.ARC generously provided via Netgalley, and it was my absolute pleasure to provide the above honest review."}, {"userName": "Mindy Lou's Book Review", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44132489-mindy-lou-s-book-review", "userReview": "Adam & Victoria's Story:We've gotten hints to Adam and Tori's attraction to each other since book 1, but Adam has his mind set on finding a non-human mate.

Adam is a controlled , almost closed off character whereas Tori is much more rebellious and out there. Still you just know that with so much going on they will have to somehow learn what trust means . Plus when it comes to romantic action between them ( gotta love a girl who knows what she wants!) the words hot and smouldering in this particular case ring oh so very true, wink wink! Still there's still the problem of finding out who is distributing Apollo on the streets and then of course Tori hasn't exactly been upfront with Adam. When I first started reading this series the covers had guys on motorbikes on them but I note the recent books are using a different type of imagery. Perhaps it was felt that the books gave off too much of an MC vibe and not enough paranormal? I actually feel these stories which connect beautifully with the Dark Protectors happily straddle both worlds and these amazing and unique characters really do set the pages alight. Add in the action scenes and of course the fact that as a reader we know a certain council member is really bad news and this fast paced story was an exciting read. There's still questions left up in the air as this book finishes but one thing I'm pretty happy about is that a certain big and grumpy ursine who is about to meet a very determined witch and I for one cannot wait!

I loved Tori, and the way she brought Adam to his knees. Story: I loved the strength Tori showed throughout Wicked Kiss, even if she put herself in danger at times because of her stubbornness. Adam pushed all her buttons, though, so it really wasn't difficult to forgive her for some lapses in judgement. The overall Realm Enforcers plot continued with the search for the mastermind behind Appollo, and the suspense was sharp-edged. There was danger everywhere, and Tori needed to learn to use her power, rather than let it use her.There were more than one show-down, and the last one made me completely breathless. Adam's fighting skills were awesome, and he didn't have to fight only for his own life, but Tori's too. Characters: Tori is human, but an enhanced human who can block electronics and other technological devices (even car motors). Because she's discovered that there are other species in the world, she has been sentenced to death... unless she mates Adam. Adam is a Coven 9 enforcer, hard as nails, always in control, and a bit stand-offish. At least, that's what Tori thinks. Characters from prior Realm Enforcers books were present in Wicked Kiss as well, and they were all fleshed out and meshed well with what I already knew of them. Writing style : Third person point of view, past tense, showing mostly either Tori's or Adam's perspective. However, through the dialogues, other characters got their time to shine (or not) as well. Feels : The full spectre of feels in Wicked Kiss. The romance made me mushy, the danger gave me fear, the action made me short of breath... I love this series so much!So far, the magical world of Ireland sucked eggs. Her dreams of rolling hills, rugged men, and wild adventures had given way to facts that tilted her universe, spun it around, and spiked it headfirst into the ground.The front doors opened, and grunts sounded. Men fighting. Punches being thrown. The back doors opened, and light flooded inside.

I attempted to do that and ended up reading the whole book again because it\u2019s just that good, so I was raring to go by the time I started this book. And needless to say, this is NOT a standalone \u2013 each book is about a different couple, but the overarching storyline is a complex one, with a lot of tie-ins to previous characters of the series, so do yourself a favour and start from the beginning. Victoria \u2018Tori\u2019 Monzelle is the younger sister of Lexi from book #1 of this series, Wicked Ride. She is a human who has unknowingly stumbled into the paranormal world of witches, vampires, shifters and demons, and in addition to her head spinning from learning that her world isn\u2019t what she expected, she also finds herself with a death sentence from the Council of the Coven 9, the ruling witch body, who have a rule that humans can\u2019t know about the existence of the paranormal world. Adam Dunne is a witch enforcer. The serious, stoic member of the powerful Dunne family, he is also the only remaining link to the goings on of the Council now that the rest of his family are either out of commission or on the run (see my note about reading the earlier books in the series). Adam is also the man that comes to Tori\u2019s rescue, refusing to allow the human to be harmed\u2026 for reasons that he refuses to explore in depth. From the beginning there is a sizzling chemistry between Adam and Tori. They already know each other, and there has been an attraction there, but this is the first time that they have spent any real time together, and Adam\u2019s domineering alphaness and Tori\u2019s stubborn bravery create some sensational fireworks as he battles to protect her. \n\u201cYou still haven\u2019t told me why you left the cabin when I specifically told you to stay there.\u201dHer chin dropped, and her eyebrows lifted, giving her the most smart-ass expression he\u2019d ever seen. \u201cI guess the simples answer is that I don\u2019t fucking take orders from you.\u201dDage snorted and busied himself with his phone again, not looking at either of them. \u201cYou should just mate her and get it over with,\u201d he mused.\nAnd things become even more complicated when Adam is forced to go to extreme lengths to keep Tori alive \u2013 vowing to the Council that he will mate her \u2013 thereby protecting her from the sentence hanging over her head.This book is another wildly entertaining ride from Rebecca Zanetti. The story moves at a quick pace with lots of action and excitement, and a whole lot of chemistry and flirty banter. Adam and Tori have a fantastic dynamic that is both snarky and sexy, and the steamy time is seriously hot. Adam has some pretty strong dominant tendencies and Tori finds herself helpless against him, and holy hot damn they are on fire together! \nShe looked over her shoulder, almost stunned by the ferocity on his angled face. \u201cYou want me?\u201d\u201cAye,\u201d he said, his eyes burning.\u201cThen take me.\u201d\nBut with their lives in danger and threats coming from multiple directions, they literally have the fight of their lives on their hands as they work to get to the bottom of vicious betrayal and corruption, and to stay ahead of those that wish them harm. Once again, Rebecca Zanetti sucked me right into her intense, intriguing and wonderfully developed world. There are twists and turns, with continued storylines from previous books and new surprises revealed as Adam, his family, and even the Realm, band together to get to protect their world. And in the middle of it all we get a wonderfully romantic (and did I mention hot?) love story that develops beautifully and realistically, with sarcasm and snark all the way, as Adam and Tori find themselves falling helplessly for each other. I loved this book. Fun, exciting, action-packed, intriguing, laugh-out-loud funny, intense, sexy and gorgeously romantic, it was everything that I have come to expect from this series, and Rebecca\u2019s writing and I can\u2019t wait to continue on. And can I just say that I am stupidly excited that Bear is finally getting his own story \u2013 especially after all that he\u2019s been through, and the revelations of the last two books - I can\u2019t wait to get my hands on his book up next.4 stars!Advanced Review Copy generously provided by the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Jessica Frances", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22767918-jessica-frances", "userReview": "This was a great entry into this series.

I dont think she has written a book that I have not yet fallen head over heals in love with.....if she writes it......I will read it!!!! Simple as that!!!!This the the 4th book in the Realm Enforcers series and its all about Adam Dunne. I have been waiting for his book, because he was always the more serious of the Dunne Brothers. And then when his leading lady turned out to be Tori, I knew it would be good.So the books all follow on from each other, and this one picks up pretty much where the last one ended. Tori has been kidnapped by the Coven of Nine because she found out that paranormal beings are very much real. The head of the Coven wants to kill her, until Adam their enforcer says that he will mate her so that she can keep their secret and not have to be executed. Of course Tori is not interested in that at all. After all she is a informant for the DEA and Adam and his biker gang are responsible for dealing the lethal drug Apollo that killed a friend of hers.The book is fast paced from start to end. It has cameos from lots of previous characters including King Dage (from The Dark Protectors Series) and it will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. I will admit to being slightly disappointed we did not see Logan or Garrett.... ( I am so waiting for those two's books)The book is full of intrigue, drama and of course romance and lots of sexy heat between our 2 main characters.

That happened to me with Wicked Kiss. Adam is a sexy enforcer with such a sexy appealing who happens to be 100% ALL alpha and full of edgy dominance while Tori is a rule breaker, sassy, takes no crap and the chemistry between her and Adam...SIZZLING HOT just doesn't cover it. Its all consuming, addicting, all around sexy, and OH SO DEVASTATING to the senses! I can't freaking WAIT for the next one.Wicked Kiss is UTTERLY and TRULY AWE-MAZING! Rebecca Zanetti knows how to create a story and series that you just can't get enough of and that just gets better and better with each new story. She wins me over..AGAIN with Wicked Kiss!

So she is a definite read no matter the subject! Adam and Tori are the story in this book ad the fact that he's trying to save her could get him killed. She has this power though and it stops engines, burns phones, and other electronic devices. She cannot get on the plane back to the states no matter how hard he is trying to put her there. Adam is an enforcer of the coven nine and his life is spent in black and white without emotions except with Victoria who is always a bright spot of color. He'll do whatever he has to to keep her alive, no matter the cost to him. She doesn't know that though. This is a beautifully written book with an amazing adventure in these pages. Always exciting and extremely enticing. These men in this series and their women are funny and fierce. I love this series and every book in it. Enjoy! I did!

The first story in the series, Wicked Ride, was one of my best reads in 2015 so the series is definitely on my must-read list. Each story can be read as a standalone romance, but there is a continuing story arc throughout the series. The underlying plot is that a drug has been developed, Apollo, that is lethal to witches (and equally to humans). Figuring out who is trying to destroy the witches, and why is at the heart of the series, and in each romance, a witch main character has been part of the action. The Dunne brothers, in particular, have had their hands full. As Realm enforcers, they\u2019ve been working undercover with motorcycle clubs who have been dealing with the drug, trying to track its source. This time, it\u2019s Adam Dunne who has an extra task \u2013 to rescue and protect Victoria Monzelle, the sister of his brother Kellach\u2019s new wife.At the end of the previous story, Wicked Burn, Victoria was working undercover for the DEA in a deal to save one of her band members, who\u2019d been caught with Apollo, from going to jail. She was kidnapped by unknown forces, and at the start of this story, she\u2019s rescued by Adam Dunne. She\u2019s only just discovered that other realms \u2013 vampires, demons, witches exist. At the same time, she knows that there is something odd about her. She has the ability to detect power fields around people and objects and often affects electronic and mechanical devices when she is around them (usually for the worse not the better). Part of Victoria\u2019s undercover work has been to track Adam\u2019s activities as a member of the Titans of Fire Motorcycle club and its suspected drug activities. Having him become her protector complicates things. Not to mention the searing attraction between them! As they get closer to discovering the truth about Apollo, so too does the danger to them both. A mating bond to Adam could give Victoria the protection she needs. Can it lead to love too?I really enjoyed this story! The author does an excellent job with the characters and settings involved in the world building, and it\u2019s fairly well established by now having been part of two series. But even for a newcomer to the books, it\u2019s easy to find your place. While several characters do make appearances in this book, they are not all introduced at once and they play important roles in the continuing story arc.The romance between Adam and Victoria is a fun and sexy affair. Victoria is a spirited woman with a tender heart. She doesn\u2019t back down from Adam in the least, even when he\u2019s adamant that she listen to him for her protection. The sparks that fly between them are not just figurative \u2013 they have a very explosive chemistry that ignites when they touch, and Adam isn\u2019t above using his witch powers to enhance their sexual encounters. Adam is a typical alpha male, but he respects the powers Victoria has too and encourages her to learn how to control them. She\u2019s a worthy mate for Adam even if she sometimes believes she is no real match for a powerful handsome man like him. Her self-esteem and belief in herself improves over the course of the story and by the end, she\u2019s confident in her ability to be a worthy partner for Adam.Besides the steamy romance, there is plenty of action that moves the plot along at a swift pace. The Coven Nine that heads the witch\u2019s realm is severely fractured and Adam has some difficult choices to make that test his loyalty. The story arc for this book concludes in an exciting and satisfying way, and there are some great hints as to what is to come. Wicked Kiss is a sexy, exciting, paranormal romance and will delight new and established fans alike.This review appears at: https://straightshootinbookreviews.co...A copy of this story was provided by the publisher via NetGalley for review."}, {"userName": "Sue \"DavinciKittie\" Brown-Moore", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5795348-sue-davincikittie-brown-moore", "userReview": "Read the full review, with tweetable quotes and similar book recommendations, on GraveTells: http://bit.ly/GTreview-WickedKiss (live on 9/24/17 at 8pm PT)\nAdam Dunne is one icy, scary mofo. As the only remaining (employed) enforcer for the witches\u2019 Coven Nine, it\u2019s all on him to keep his rogue brothers off the council\u2019s radar and stay legit long enough to crack the Apollo drug ring spreading in Seattle. When shit goes sideways\u2014as you know it must\u2014keeping himself and Victoria Monzelle alive takes precedence, and these two mix like oil and water. He wants control, and she\u2019s not giving it up without a fight. Good thing they\u2019ve both got fighter spirits.When Adam isn\u2019t losing his mind over his growing attraction to Tori, he is scarily calculating and ruthless. More than just a soldier, Adam Dunne is natural strategist and a hardened killer. His job is no joke, and he takes it seriously, even when his nation seems to be turning its back on him and his family.Tori is strong, stubborn, and free-spirited, a musician who is under-appreciated and doing her best to hold her life together when it\u2019s falling apart from all sides. She has spunk and fire (not literally, of course\u2014that\u2019s Adam\u2019s thing, and boy is his special ability nifty!) and a giving soul. Her chemistry with Adam is intense and immediate. Like nearly all of Rebecca Zanetti\u2019s couples, the power dynamic in the relationship skews toward Adam. His need for control compliments her deep-down, unacknowledged need to submit, and the struggle between them really shines in the sex scenes. And also, this guy can make fire\u2014expertly controlled heat\u2014on his fingertips. Think about that for a minute\u2026This book furthers the Grizzly story arc as well, giving the very grumpy and terribly adorable Bear some page time. One of his scenes with Tori is seriously cute and makes me want to read his story even more.Wicked Kiss thrills and dominates. Witch enforcer Adam Dunne kicks ass and takes names, and Victoria Monzelle meets him toe to toe. Their intense chemistry rules the pages while they sneakily conquer each other\u2019s hearts. Wicked Kiss is a landmark story in the Realm Enforcers series, meaning some really important world things happen, so it should probably be read as part of the full series. You could read it as a standalone, but you\u2019ll miss a lot of context and have to sort through a host of new secondary characters. This series is worth your time, so go pick it up and start with Wicked Ride if you\u2019re new!Wicked Kiss is a fast-paced paranormal romance with (literally) hot sex, memorable characters, and bad guys you'll want to CRUSH.

But for this controlled, highly intelligent skilled enforcer, it won't be just anyone. And it wasn't. He has definitely met his match. A hidden agenda, betrayals, and edge of the seat excitement surround quite the spirited romance.Wicked Kiss is book four in the Realm Enforcers series which is the extension of the earlier Dark Protectors. It follows on the heels of the books before it and assumes the reader is familiar with the world and characters so it doesn't do well as a standalone or out of order.I loved getting Adam's story as he was the interesting brother of the three witch brother enforcers. He's so put together and now he is matched up with a woman who is as far from put together as can be. Victoria Monzelle is not new to the series and is the sister of the heroine from book one. Unlike Alex who is a tough cop, Victoria is the wild child. She gets into trouble without trying and she has a defiance issue that sparks to life the second she's in over her head or anywhere near Adam. I confess that I'm on the fence about Victoria. On the one hand, I find her fun and amusing as a heroine who discovers herself along the way. She was a good foil for Adam and got him down off his high horse at times. On the other hand, she just blissfully trots into danger with no thought for consequences because A. she wants to and doesn't think through what her actions will cause or B. She has a switch that turns off her brain the second Adam gives her an order even if its for hers or other's safety. So, they had good banter and some chemistry, but I was reserved about her oppositional tendencies.The ongoing troubles with the attempt to destroy the witch nation continues to draw ever more suspenseful and tight as Adam and the others get closer to the instigator behind it all who is protected behind well constructed allies and plans. Things are particularly rough in this one because most of Adam's family are in hiding because the lead witch of the Coven Nine wants them incapacitated or dead. I liked the sense of desperation and the great action scenes. It didn't hurt that Dage the Vampire King made a few appearances.Each book reads fast and leaves me thirsty for the next installment. I love the hints that a certain Council Witch and a crotchety, crazy bear shifter might be the next to see some action.All in all, I eagerly snatch up the next books and love the blend of action, suspense and sizzling passion the author brings to her paranormal romances. Those who enjoy strong action plot and characters should give these a try.I rec'd this book from Net Galley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Jacque", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8975992-jacque", "userReview": "Folks you are going to need to pay attention here because Wicked Kiss is going to go fast. Victoria and Adam, Dunne family, the council, the King, Bear. That's a lot to take in...and I loved every bit of it.Victoria and Adam are oil and vinegar. He's smooth, by the book and she's saucy and spirited. Together then had me laughing and dying to find out what comes next. Lots of banter fly between them as the struggle to find out who is distributing Apollo, deal with the order from the council to mate or else, and avoid who is after them. Banter isn't the only thing between them. Hot steamy goodness to make everything even more exciting...just watch out for that mating brand! LOL!!!Along for the ride are previous characters, particularly the Dunne family, Bear and the King. The Dunne's and Bear I am familiar with and love seeing them again. I can hardly stand the excitement to know Bear gets his own book. New to me, however, is King Dage. This is when I kick myself for not having discovered Ms. Zanetti and the Dark Protectors sooner. Some plots were easy to determine other were a mystery until the end. Honestly, I didn't care if I had the entire plot in front of me, I know there would still be surprises along the way for me to discover. Which is why I recommend reading the Realm Enforcers to everybody. The story ends on a high note for most everybody and has a feel that, with the exception of Bear's book, this series is ending very soon. I know fans of this series as well as I am going to miss it.

I really didn't like Adam, he was way too high handed and just annoyed me most of the time. Granted he was trying to keep Tori safe, the way he did it just did not agree with me. Tori I loved, normally when the heroine does stupid things and goes off on her own despite the danger that is out to get her it just pisses me off in Tori's case I don't blame her for it. They fight the sexual chemistry so hard and it just made it so aggravatingly funny. Tori tries to bluff Adam on certain things, sexual preferences, and he just turns it around on her making her feel like he can teach her a thing or two. The story was fast paced and just wow, so much happens it's hard to believe it just over 280 pages. I would recommend reading the previous books just because both Tori and Adam are introduced early on and there is a bit of a story arc going on and some of the things will just make more sense. Opposites attract when it comes to the straight-laced Enforcer Adam Dunne and rock-chick song writer Victoria Monzelle. Ever since Tori found out about witches and vampires because her sister fell in love with a witch she has been kidnapped twice, saved this last time by Adam Dunne who going against orders from his superiors rescues Tori. Unfortunately they end up getting caught anyways and standing in front of the Council of Nine Adam vows to mate Tori to save her from execution. Keeping Tori save is only one thing that Adam is trying to do, he's also trying to find out who is the traitor on the council, with his brothers wanted for being traitors and his cousin framed for being the one behind the deadly drug, Apollo, which can kill a witch, Adam and his family are working with Dage and the others to prove who is really behind it all. Tori understands the importance of what Adam is doing but she's also trying to save her sister from ruining her life and saving her career. Tori is being blackmailed by an obsessed DEA who says she has to find proof where the Apollo coming from or else she will arrest Lexie as a crooked cop.The only saving point for Adam is that he doesn't want to force Tori into mating, and all his threats to spank Tori it really isn't a punishment to her she starts to provoke him just because she can and it turns her on. Adam and Tori spend most of the time trying to convince themselves that they wouldn't be good together, it takes something pretty big to change that.Overall, it was a good read, I enjoy Rebecca Zanetti's writing style."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth Neal", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18044929-elizabeth-neal", "userReview": "Adam, an enforcer, and Tori, a DEA informant, have been circling around their attraction to one another since they first met.

For the most part I did like her. I liked her stubborness, loyalty and determination to do what she deemed was best, but those were also the things that had her making decisions that would get her into situations that she couldn\u2019t handle and therefore made things worse. I wanted to reach out and shake her many times. Adam was all kinds of Alpha AF, not that any of the males in this series and the spin off would be anything less, but there was just something missing and he didn\u2019t draw me in like the previous males have. With my tepid feels towards these two, I was some what \u201cmeh\u201d about their journey. I don\u2019t mind the push/pull thing, or the uber dominate male smexy thing, but the lack of communication which led to many, many assumptions got old.
