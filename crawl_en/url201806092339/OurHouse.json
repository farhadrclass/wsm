However, on this particular beautiful winter's day she spots a removal van outside her house - but it can't possibly be her house, the house a few doors down has been on the market, it must be that one. As she reaches her house, the realisation that someone is moving their furniture in, their personal possessions, hits her like a sledge hammer, but she'll sort it out ( won't she?) it's just a ridiculous mistake surely. Well actually no it isn't a mistake, and she desperately needs to contact her estranged husband Bram - problem is, Bram is nowhere to be found, and not only that, but their two boys Harry and Leo aren't where they should be either!Well goodness me, what a roller coaster ride of a story this is, and what avenues it takes us down as deceit becomes the major player. It isn't a thriller in the normal sense of the word, but it's gripping nevertheless. The characters speak to us through various mediums, ( Bram via Word document ) and in that respect we get to know much more about Bram's part in all this than Fi does. You know the old saying \"Oh what a tangled web we weave, when first we set out to deceive\"? Absorb that thought because this is deceit at its most profound. Add in numerous twists and turns and you've got a real winner. Thoroughly enjoyed it!* Thank you to Netgalley and Simon and Schuster for my ARC in exchange for an honest review*"}, {"userName": "Miriam Smith", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35740838-miriam-smith", "userReview": "FAB-U-LOUS!!! I absolutely LOVED \"our house\" by Louise Candlish - I couldn't put it down, couldn't stop thinking about it - it was truly addictive, compelling and hypnotic. It was by far the best psychological thriller I've read for quite a while and I expect it to do extremely well in the bestsellers chart. A family moves into the house they\u2019ve just bought in Trinity Avenue. Nothing strange about that. Except it is your house. And you didn\u2019t sell it. Fiona (Fi) arrives home to find a removals van outside her house. Trinity Avenue has been her family\u2019s home for years. Where are all her belongings? How could this have happened? Desperately calling her ex-husband Bram, Fi discovers he has disappeared. The more Fi uncovers, the more she realises their lives have been turned upside by a nightmare of their own making. A devastating crime has been committed, but who exactly is the guilty party? What has Bram hidden from her \u2013 and what has she hidden from him?I enjoyed reading Fiona's recollection of the story through a podcast and Bram's through a letter/word document interspersed with the events as they happened. This was a unique way of story telling and very creative that was fun to follow and obviously very skilfully put together. Although Fi was perhaps a little too forgiving and nice towards her husband, it was believable considering her love for the children and the concern for their welfare. I personally haven't heard of the 'birds nest' set up before but can see how it could work by putting the child/children's needs first. Property fraud, murder, adultery, secrets, lies, betrayal, double crossing - this book has it all and much more, twists and turns along the way that keep the story exciting and entertaining. Many a time I was caught out at the sudden revelations.The premise of the story is such a frightening scenario, especially with the fraudsters being so close to home and it really did have my stomach in a flutter of nerves thinking about it happening to me! I will definitely be reading more by this brilliant author again, as far as I'm concerned Louise has reached the dizzy heights of exceptional psychological suspense with professionalism, creative imagination and tremendous storytelling. I was spellbound to the very last page and quite upset when it ended but wow! What an ending! With a beautiful cover too, this book just oozes to be read and it should come as no surprise that I highly recommend \"our house\" to psychological and thriller readers young and old, it's tantalisingly good and not to be missed!5 stars"}, {"userName": "Pouting Always", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-pouting-always", "userReview": "Fiona Lawson comes home to discover that there are other people moving into her home, taken aback she confronts the people moving in. When they insist that they have bought the house and now legally own it Fiona tries to get in contact with her husband Bram. Though Bram and Fiona are separated they have been maintaining a custody arrangement that allows one of them to stay with the children in the house on different days through out the week while the other stays at an apartment. Fiona begins to realize what a mistake she has made in suggesting this arrangement as the day progresses and she is unable to reach Bram or locate their children. Fiona struggles to find a solution as she faces the impending loss of her home and family. Spoilers ahead blah blah. This was really good, like there was maybe one whole complaint I had about this one and that was it. This was definitely 4.5 stars. I was so engrossed through out, and honestly it really roped me in the way things escalated. Like it was just driving violations and the next thing you know Bram is committing fraud and laundering money. It also felt pretty believable and I have to say even though Bram had his faults I felt so bad for him through out. The way he just kept getting more boxed into the situation, I know he has created the situation, but it was still quite depressing especially knowing that in the end he ends up killing himself.The whole plot was just amazing the way it unfolded and the twists and everything managed to stay believable at the same time. I also appreciate the sad but hopeful note at the end. Now the one thing that peeved me, the fact that it gets revealed that Merle is the one Bram slept with because it didn't feel foreshadowed. I'm mostly confused because I thought at one point in the book the women from HR comes to talk to him and tell him she's pregnant but now I'm thinking it clearly must have been Merle, unless he knocked them both up, and I just misread it. That just threw the whole thing off kilter because I wasn't even wondering who it had been and I had attributed the pregnancy as being with the women he slept with after the separation. I just felt taken aback and it was probably all my fault I just missed any foreshadowing. Anyway definitely one of the best things I've read so far this year, unfortunately the list of things I have read is small this year because I have to go be responsible and all that bullshit. I'll be back when I finally read a few more books to write reviews but definitely recommend this one to anyone looking for their next read."}, {"userName": "Hajar", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60671127-hajar", "userReview": "This book starts with a wonderful premise but fails to deliver.The story kept dragging on and on and I found myself waiting for something to happen, anything that will pull me back into the story but needless to say, I was completely and utterly disappointed.I did not care about any of the characters and the plot, even though it\u2019s very well-written, it failed to hold my interest.

Shockingly, she watches a sofa being carried into her own house with many additional pieces being transported like a strange furniture caravan. This can't be happening. She enters into her once familiar surroundings only to find strangers staring back at her. Arguing with these people serves up no results. She madly calls her husband, Bram, but his cellphone is no longer in service. And from here on out, Fi's life will no longer be in service as well.Louise Candlish creates a mindboggling storyline that follows the lives of Fi and Bram Lawson who have separated after his infidelity. They have strategized a temporary custody module for their two young sons called \"bird's nest\" in which each parent takes turns living in an outside apartment and rotating residence in the family home so the boys will have stability. But life in the outside world will certainly have its trappings. Fi will be clueless as to what Bram has been up to. And Bram will be caught up in the quicksand of his own making.I would gauge this one honestly at 3.5* and I kicked it up to 4* for its originality. The format of the story is told in alternating pages of Bram's Word Document responses and Fi's Story. It's recanted in the aftermath on a website called The Victim, a crime podcast, with viewers tweeting their theories. Prepare yourself for certain sections that go on a bit longer than necessary. We, as readers, seem to sit on a nest of eggs that linger and linger in the hatching stage. But it does pick up some speed towards the climatic ending with no good deed goes unpunished. And the Universe tends to straighten crooked paths all in good time. Well, now......I received a copy of Our House through Berkley Publishers for an honest review. I would like to thank them and Louise Candlish for the opportunity."}, {"userName": "Holly  B", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39749481-holly-b", "userReview": "Man, I wanted to love this book more. I was hooked after the first chapter, and I could feel the tension jumping off the page.I thought it was a brilliant premise. Fiona pulls up to her house to find a moving van parked out front and strangers moving in! Just the thought of that is enough to make my heart race. Fiona will tell her story through a crime podcast and her husband, Bram tells his side through a typed word document. I really did enjoy both characters.A wonderful, detailed plot and a good twist was not enough to keep the story from drowning in a repetitive narrative and somewhat tedious pace. I did figure out the twist, but I enjoyed being shocked as soon as I figured it out (if that makes any sense)! I was left underwhelmed, but still a good twisty read.

Now Bram has disappeared and Fi is unable to find him just when she needs him t help unravel this mystery.Fiona's story told through a popular podcast called 'The Victim', is interspersed with notes from a document written by Bram filling in the gaps of how this nightmare came about.

The story goes back and forth between the wife who has no idea what is going on and her estranged husband who might be keeping a secret or two.While I liked the idea of the book it was not an \"edge of my seat, stay up until 2 am to finish\" type of read. It was definitely a solid read but I wish it could have been something more. After finishing the book it still feels like the character of Bram, the husband, was not fully developed.

So why on earth has another family moved in? Surely your soon to be ex husband with whom you share the house and co-parent your two children using a 'birds-nest' arrangement might know what is going on, if only you could get a hold of him! Where is he and where has he taken your children?This is the predicament Fiona finds herself in, as we get to read from her perspective via a podcast for The Victim, where women share their stories of being hurt and betrayed and listeners get to comment. Fi's husband Bram, tells us the details Fi doesn't know via a letter where he confesses all that has been tormenting him and of the great lengths he has gone to as a consequence of his poor judgment. The majority of the book focuses on the unfolding of events over the past six months, providing the reader with the full picture, with some events I had seen coming whilst other twists and turns shocking me to the point that I was compelled into needing to know the why's and the how's of it all. And just as I thought I had it all figured out, a brilliantly clever plot twist sucker punched me right in the stomach taking my breath away with its cherry on top twist.With exceptionally well developed characters that brought this story to life, this unique, modern and fresh offering to the domestic noir genre had me thoroughly enjoying my first read by Louise Candlish!

There wasn't actually a huge amount of mystery about the plot because you find out a significant amount from fairly near the start, but as the novel continues you realise that there's more and more which isn't quite what it seems...! It's definitely a fantastic example of the hugely popular 'Domestic Noir' genre.I'm not going to rehash the synopsis or the plot here, but I will say that the way the book is structured - partly showing Fi's experience, partly through excerpts of the real-life 'victim' podcast she is appearing on, and partly through excerpts from a word document her ex-husband is writing (but to whom, and why?) means the reader, at times, knows more than Fi does as we've heard directly from Bram, giving us an interesting edge over Fi herself, who is supposed to be recounting the story.\u00a0 I enjoyed trying to\u00a0work out exactly what had happened with her ex-husband, and how everything got to the state it's in when we first join Fi, on Friday 13 January 2017.Just when you think it's figured out, something else surprises you, and this made for riveting reading.

She\u2019s been having a difficult time in her marriage but they have both been handling things like the adults that they are. I was spinning in circles trying to work out the truth as the plot twisted and turned its way towards its dramatic conclusion.To begin with though I did find the way the plot unraveled a little confusing but as it progressed I got used to the way it jumped around and settled into the storyline. There is the discovery of the new couple in Fi and Brams home but there are also two other very different and very distinctive styles of narrative as both Fi and her husband Bram tell their side of the story.

It's one of those books that draws in the reader with an explosive and intriguing opening and continues to manipulate and trick with each chapter. I was well and truly hooked; staying up late to read a few more chapters and carrying the book around so that I could sneak in a furtive page or two every now and again.As always, Louise Candlish's greatest strength is her character creation and depiction of family relationships. She absolutely excels in this, with characters that are recognisable, and intricately woven alliances between them.So, that beginning; Fi Lawson arrives home after a weekend away to find a removal van outside. Louise Candlish's insight into Fi's reaction is wonderful. Of course, Fi thinks that the van is next door, or that her estranged husband Bram may have promised to store something for a mate, or he may even have invited someone to stay. That's what Bram is like; unpredictable, compulsive and quite frankly, a bit of an arse. As Fi realises that she's been clutching at straws and actually the woman in her kitchen believes that she has bought the house from Fi and Bram, the shock sinks in. As a reader, I was gripped. I had no idea where this was going and that feeling continues throughout the novel.Our House is really cleverly structured and this just adds to the intrigue and mystery. The reader is treated to snippets as they happen in real time, along with transcripts from a Podcast called Victim where Fi relates her story. The comments after each section, written by the listeners are interesting and really echo our modern-day reality; where everything seems to be played out on Social Media and everyone is a judge.Possibly the most interesting and revealing sections of the story are told by Bram himself, written in a letter, that begins 'this is a suicide note'. As the reader is witness to everything that Bram has done, and Fi is totally in the dark, there's often a feeling of frustration when reading her story, yet this does not lessen it in anyway, and despite the fact that we think we know everything, this author very cleverly drops some cunning curveballs that create more shock and gasp.So, no more from me about the plot. Just buy it and read it and see for yourself, let me know what you think? Did you guess? Did that ending baffle you, and then floor and then make you realise just how incredibly clever Louise Candlish is? I bet it will.Absolutely brilliant, I loved every page and it's safe to say that I'm still a massive fan of this author."}, {"userName": "Umut Rados", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24816039-umut-rados", "userReview": "I really loved the premise of this book, and couldn't wait to start reading it. However, unfortunately, I was disappointed. There were problems both in writing and the plot. The book dragged on and on, too many unnecessary conversations, information, etc. It needed a good editing, and a big chop. It's too many pages compared to the actual content of the plot. If the book was way shorter, it could have a much better pace, and it would make it more interesting. I also didn't find the story behind this mystery quite ordinary, not imaginative. I kept looking for more, but it really was all there is. I found it simplistic, and not a good woven thriller mystery. It didn't get me excited. I think what happened was unrealistic as well. The writer didn't delve into the characters deep enough too, which makes the readers care more. What I liked was the multiple perspectives. We read from the point of view of the husband and the wife both. I also liked the idea of the wife going on a podcast. Overall, although there were interesting elements here and there, it was not enough to pull the story together. I would like to thank the Publishers and NetGalley for sending me an arc of this book in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Cleo Bannister", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3162627-cleo-bannister", "userReview": "Every time I see Louise Candlish has a new book out, I dance a little dance. Why? Because in the crowded psychological thriller arena she takes a sideways look at modern life to create tales that are on the edge of credulity, and yet, so believable when they flow from her pen.Such is the story told in Our House. If you read the synopsis you would doubt how realistic it is for a woman, mother of two boys, to return home unexpectedly one afternoon to find that her house has been sold and her possessions are nowhere to be seen. Really? I thought as my eyebrows shot up way past my hairline\u2026 that simply couldn\u2019t happen, could it?What makes this book particularly brilliant is the detailed plotting and the structure of the book. Fiona tells us her story via a podcast called The Victim where women, it is mainly women, explain how they\u2019ve been duped, betrayed or hurt to an audience who comment along as the show unfolds. As I said, oh so modern and I wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised to find out that a variety of this idea is a real thing! Fiona takes us back to the time when she split up with her husband Bram through the last few months where they settled on a \u2018birds nest\u2019 arrangement for custody of the boys. And with my finger firmly on the pulse of modern life, I already knew this is where the children of a broken partnership stay put in their own home and the parents swap in and out like weather house men and women to care for them on designated days. At other times, when they were not in the house, Fiona and Bram stayed in a small rented flat. Oh so modern but you have to wonder how practical in real life\u2026Bram tells us his side of the same story, where we find out everything that Fiona doesn\u2019t know, via a letter. This is a man tormented by his mistakes and trying to put things right. And despite all that he confesses to, Louise Candlish makes him quite a likeable man. I think this is key to the plotline retaining such a sense of realism and so despite my initial reservations I had no trouble believing the events that unfold.Along with the two versions we are grounded in the present, Friday 13 January 2017 the day Fiona discovers her house has been sold and her estranged husband and sons are missing. It is the day that the remnants of Fiona\u2019s life that she has been clinging to disintegrates.Of course Fiona and Bram don\u2019t live in isolation \u2013 their house after all is worth millions, in a sought after area which has risen in value. They have neighbours who try to do the right thing following the breakdown of the couple\u2019s marriage, keeping the links in place, if weakened by the change in status quo. The author has a brilliant eye for the way people behave and so just as I so enjoyed her previous novels set in similar upwardly mobile settings, the characters her really do make the story come alive.If you like your domestic noir to be something out of the ordinary you really must read Our House. The unbelievable is turned on its head, the characters so lifelike you will feel you know them well all in an undeniably up-to-date setting. A fully deserved five stars from Cleopatra Loves Books."}, {"userName": "Heidi", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9693936-heidi", "userReview": "My favourite genre is mystery / suspense, but it is getting harder and harder to find an original story that hasn\u2019t been done before in varying shades of grey. So picture my excitement when I stumbled across the blurb of Our House on Netgalley, it sounded so intriguing! Imagine coming home from a weekend away to find that your home has been stripped of all your possessions and strangers are moving in, claiming that they have legitimately purchased the house. How is this possible? And who could have done it? This is the situation Fiona finds herself in when returning from a romantic getaway with a new boyfriend, leaving her ex-husband minding her house and her kids. Scary, huh? If you think the premise sounds a bit outlandish, don\u2019t worry, because Louise Candlish writes her story with such conviction and lays such a solid foundation that you will think twice about ever leaving your house again! I loved her writing style, which incorporates a \u201ctranscript\u201d from a live true crime podcast (in which Fiona tells her side of the story) and a document in which Bram, her estranged husband, confesses his part in the events that unfold. Incorporating social media has become a popular feature in contemporary crime fiction, seeing how it plays such a big part in most of our lives, and Candlish uses this to its full potential. What ensues is a she said / he said type of story that is chilling and ingenious in equal measures.Have you ever read a book in which one of the main characters makes one bad decision, and that little flutter of butterfly wings soon turns into a huge shitstorm of epic proportion that will alter everyone\u2019s lives? I love those stories, even though at times they make me cringe in horror at the avalanche that is building momentum as you frantically turn the pages. Candlish proves that immense suspense can be built through putting her characters in everyday situations each and every one of us may find ourselves in during the course of our lives. Here we have a couple with small children, who try to work out their marriage problems amicably for the sake of their two sons. I marvelled at the concept of bird\u2019s nest parenting, a shared custody arrangement of separated couples where parents take turns living in the family home where their children live 100% of the time. Sounds good in theory, and I can imagine that it is a good solution for the children involved (if it works). But is it really possible to pull it off successfully? This is a suspense novel, so of course things soon start to go wrong \u2013 and escalate with the speed of a runaway train headed for an abyss, building tension and dread as the story speeds along.The most difficult thing in selling a contemporary mystery is often character development, and Candlish excels in that department, Although I am far from the suburban housewife Fiona is portrayed as, I could easily put myself in her shoes and constantly questioned myself how I would react. I felt her confusion and her pain, and marvelled at her constant optimism and trust in the most dire of circumstances. Even Bram, with the part he plays in the whole situation, was a likeable \u2013 if flawed \u2013 character, caught up in a terrible situation. Our House is one of those books that made me wonder why I had not discovered this author before, but feeling immensely glad that I now have. Our House is a gripping, modern-day domestic-noir mystery built around a unique premise that had me totally enthralled from start to finish. I thoroughly enjoyed it, even though it cost me hours of sleep as I read deep into the night unable to put the book down. Highly recommended if you\u2019re a lover of the genre or just looking for a cracking good read!4.5 starsThank you to Netgalley and Simon & Schuster Australia for the free electronic copy of this novel and for giving me the opportunity to provide an honest review. *blog*  *facebook*  *instagram*"}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14459210-donna", "userReview": "\u201cCome to me now and rest your head for just five minutes, everything is good.Such a cozy room,The windows are illuminated by the evening sunshine through them,Fiery gems for you, only for you.\u201d\n \u2013 excerpt from Our House lyrics, written by Graham Nash (Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young)What a ride! In this book, something that goes wrong goes VERY wrong, and it keeps getting even more wrong as the story progresses. Fi and Bram live with their two sons on a lovely, well-to-do street that\u2019s becoming a more desirable place to live every day. Real estate is booming here, and conversation among the neighbors sometimes centers on how much their properties are increasing in value. What fun to become millionaires if they decide to sell, even though none of them really have the desire to leave, including Fi and Bram.But the two are not without their marital problems, and Bram, in particular, has been keeping secrets from his wife. Many secrets, that unfold throughout the story. Fi has always been forgiving, but there\u2019s a certain point when enough is enough. The two still want only the best for their children, however, and they work out a separation agreement that will keep the boys feeling secure and will keep them in their lovely home. Until the day Fi comes home and finds all of their belongings moved out and a stranger greeting her at the door.Unfortunately, Bram has been hiding dark secrets from everyone. Everyone, that is, except a certain couple who know more about him than he realizes. Blackmail ensues, and lie upon lie threatens to topple the couple\u2019s dreams for keeping their home while maintaining a civilized breakup, all leading to a dramatic ending that I never saw coming. It left me saying \u201cWow!\u201d as I finished the last page.This is an engrossing thriller about murder, fraud and blackmail told from both Fi\u2019s and Bram\u2019s points of view, although in very different ways.Thanks to NetGalley and Berkeley Publishing Group for an advance copy in exchange for my honest review. 4 stars!"}, {"userName": "Mandy White", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33018840-mandy-white", "userReview": "review to come after holidaysWell this book was certainly different.

Turns out Bram, Fi's husband, (they are separated) has disappeared after secretly selling the house and removing all of the family's belongings. From there the story hinges on the whys and hows this came about, but what makes this a little different is the POVs are from Fi in the form of a podcast (complete with listener comments) and her fugitive husband who is writing his confession in a Word doc. The story continues at a breakneck speed--for a while anyway. The middle seemed to drag and I ended up skimming until the last 50 pages which got me completely caught up on what was going on. But that ending (for me ianyway) was a complete gut punch. But don't go by my experience. Others have loved it and haven't gotten bogged down; sometimes reading moods happen. Try this if you want to read a good domestic thriller with a few good twists along the way and form your own opinion. It is reminiscent of Kathleen Barber's ARE YOU SLEEPING which also features a podcast as a central part of the story.

Well it was, and my head is spinning as a result. Is it too soon to ask for a sequel? I think this may be one of those books where the reader really is left to draw their own conclusions. But then nothing about this book was possibly as I expected, and it is one that covers huge topics and arguably gives a great how to guide for how to pull of various crimes, although how successfully, and the affects on your mental health may vary! What would you think if you returned home one day to find another family moving into your house, despite knowing 100% that you hadn't sold the house. Then take into account that your soon to be ex-husband isn't answering the phone and he is the only other one that may be able to explain what is going on. Well that is what happens to Fi at the start of this book. Now alternating with Fi's perspective we get the full story from Bram, her husband, and can see the lengths a desperate man will go to and how a few errors of judgment can quickly escalate. The timelines move about a bit during the book, and the majority of it is the explanation of the events of the past 6 months, from both Bram and Fi's point of view. I'm not sure how much I identified with either character but what I was sure of was I wanted to see how it would all turn out, and just what all the reasoning behind it was. Of course nothing is quite that straight forward and as the story ramps up, there are some twists and turns, some that I sort of saw coming and others that did blindside me. All of which added up to a very compulsive read that I was hooked on.

Within a couple of pages Louise Candlish sets the scene of a domestic nightmare and piques the intrigue of the reader. There was little doubt I was going to devour this book. I had to know what the hell was going on! Through Fiona\u2019s podcasts and Bram\u2019s desperate and tortured word documents the full horror is revealed.What\u2019s so fascinating about this book is that it\u2019s both far fetched and believable in equal measures. On one hand, how the hell can a house be sold from beneath you? Yet, as we are taken deeper into the story and the full extent of the situation is revealed, it becomes more and more plausible.Fiona and Bram\u2019s marriage is crumbling after Fiona discovers her husband has cheated again. In a grown up attempt to maintain the lifestyle and beloved home of their children, Fiona suggests the completely modern approach of \u2018birds nest\u2019 parenting, where the children will remain where they are and it\u2019ll be the parents who move in and out for their allocated contact time. It\u2019s one of those concepts that sound great in theory right? But you can see the disaster waiting to happen right from the start, almost like watching through your fingers.The problems begins when Bram \u2013 impulsive, deceitful and weak, gets a speeding ticket. What begins as a slight misdemeanor turns into a snowball of lies, tragedy, panic, manipulation and blackmail. I thought Louise Candlish captured the runaway-train-out-of-control effect fantastically, as Bram\u2019s life literally spirals and he finds himself deeper and deeper in a situation he can\u2019t get out of. I wanted to scream at him STOP!! I also thought Fiona\u2019s character contrasted brilliantly against him, coming across as calm and capable, completely reasonable yet unable to see what was happening around her.Our House really is a story of one lie leading to another and events which spiral out of control. It\u2019s a roller-coaster at times, fueled with adrenaline and increasingly frenzied panic, an intensifying sense of foreboding and an ending to leave you gasping in horror. This is the very best kind of domestic noir \u2013 where the reader feels like an outsider looking in, can see the cracks and sense the impending doom but just doesn\u2019t know how it will all unravel.
