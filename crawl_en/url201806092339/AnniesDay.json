You\u2019ll hate Annie, because that\u2019s what the author wants you to do. If you go in knowing zero detail about this short, short story, you\u2019re going to call her dozens of names before you get to the revelation.I wish I could describe this as \u2018\u2018original\u2019\u2019 but it\u2019s sadly unrealistic. It reads weirdly and, to me, it felt like the author really had no idea how to end it so he just picked something at random to conclude it.

Normally I would feel guilty including a \"book\" this short on my list. Yet, today was one of those days where I didn't even have five minutes to sit and read. A few friends recommended it so I thought why not. This short story can be read in five minutes. The beginning paragraphs had my mind thinking not so good things. The ending two sentences have a twist that made me laugh. This short piece of writing demonstrates that Weir is a good writer, so I will have to add more of his books to my list."}, {"userName": "Aj the Ravenous Reader", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30248594-aj-the-ravenous-reader", "userReview": "Andy Weir could totally pull the above gif off.
