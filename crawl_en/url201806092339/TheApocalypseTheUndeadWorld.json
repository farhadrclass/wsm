Now that I've finished it and read some reviews, I'm glad that I'm not the only one who feels creeped out by a sense of misogyny and racism in the novel. I totally get that rapes and plunder and mayhem and slaves and all manners of horror occur during wars or collapsing civilizations or just on any day in a major city right this second. I get that women would (and do) trade sex for survival or have sex forced upon them. But in this story the women are always being white-knighted and the men are always finding their inner white-knight. I'm not even going to touch on the creepy racism vibe with the Cassie character. The author cries foul against the accusations of misogyny and racism in this book but if enough random readers are commenting on those topics, then there's further dialog to be had IMO. Then the sex scenes. I'm no prude so sex scenes don't make me flinch unless they feel randomly inserted (ha!) into a story JUST to have a sex scene or two. Stilted and contrived. Unnecessary. Further, this needs an editor. It's not the worst Indie book I've seen but there are plenty of spelling and grammar errors throughout. Finally, I know it sounds like I hate this book but I don't. It's by far not the worst in the genre and I'm hopelessly addicted to Zombies so I'm always stoked to read a new Zombie book. However, there are better ones to read. Hell, if you like the genre but want something not as mainstream, try Keith Blackmore's Mountain Man series. 2 stars."}, {"userName": "Andrea", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6608084-andrea", "userReview": "Well, I don't know if I'm going to make it through this one--I rarely give up on a book I've started but this one opened with one of the most obnoxious introductions/warnings I've ever encountered. The author basically says if a reader has described anything as racist or misogynist more than once in the last six months, if a reader is \"easily offended\", then this is not the book for him or her. The author claims to write about reality, but apparently he doesn't believe racism and sexism are problematic in our society. The overall sentiment seems to be, \"If you are some PC asshole, don't buy my book\"--and I wouldn't have bought it (though I don't consider myself a PC asshole) if Audible had included this caveat in the book's description--the only reason I purchased it in the first place was because it was part of a two-for-one offer. I'm going to give it a chance but that intro pissed me off and left me with a very negative first impression of the author.I did end up listening to the entire book but. bottom line, I just didn't think it was very good. The writing is awkward and there are many grammatical errors. There are tons of cringe-worthy descriptions--like, \"her nipples defied her clothing,\" (I'm paraphrasing--I think the actual quote was worse) when talking about a teenage girl, and the sex scenes are appallingly bad. I also find it incredibly unlikely that people would have time, energy, or motivation to focus on high school-ish romances in the wake of an apocalyptic event."}, {"userName": "Doreen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9822185-doreen", "userReview": "As per usual with a Peter Meredith novel, deep characters and plot drive The Apocalypse and for this I was happy since I have never been much into zombies books. I was afraid I was going to find my self knee deep in endless descriptions of blood and brains and gore. Or have my head swirling with the details of the different types of guns used to kill the millions of undead wandering around America.Instead I happily followed along after characters who gradually stopped being characters in my mind and became people. This is what makes the story a five star rating to me: the fact that I was so drawn into the lives of the people facing a horrible new world. Each faced it in their own way, some for the better and some definitely for the worse, yet each faced it as a real person would and not as a cartoon character.The story itself I think was relatively straight forward for the genre: a secret russian military virus, left over from the old Soviet days, unleashes zombie hordes upon the few surviviors, who scramble in the ruins to live. After my previous two attempts at reading zombie books were placed on my DNF shelf it is my guess that people who love zombies may find The Apocalypse less compelling than people who just love a good book."}, {"userName": "Jason Parent", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11708867-jason-parent", "userReview": "This book.... is frustrating and hard to rate. There were parts I loved and parts I hated. So maybe that's the best way to break it down. Also, you should know that I listened to the Audiobook version of this. The narrator did a fine job, not exceptional, but certainly nothing to complain about. So, without further ado:What I Liked:Neil and Sadie - untraditional heroes. Theses two characters, and in fact all the main characters, are well developed. They also seem realistic and act in a way that also seems, for the most part probable. This also can be said of all seven of the main characters (Ram, Cassie, Neil, Sadie, Sarah, Julia, and Eric). But Neil and Sadie gave us people to cheer for, even if both were unlikeable at the start. Good character arcs/development and emotional storytelling.Also, the author didn't hold back - he told the story as he felt it needed to be told, with the air of honesty behind his words. Characters weren't necessarily good or bad, but they were who they were, products of their upbringing and their environments, past and present. This made them and the story feel real.What I Didn't Like:I don't know if this appears in the written version, but in the audiobook, the author begins with a warning, basically chastising anyone that would find his work misogynistic, racist, etc. His CHARACTERS were, in many regards, racist and misogynistic, but I (and I don't think any intelligent reader) would say that because characters exemplify these traits, the author is a proponent thereof. So, I don't think the author has any of these negative qualities and certainly should not be judged by his characters.However, I did find it a bit demeaning that he would feel the need to tell me this at the outset. Will some readers read and review it unreasonably? Certainly, but opinions are just that and feelings are what they are: and trying to change them in an opening (and even worse, a follow up at the end of the novel) seemed petty and insulting, though I do believe the author was addressing the criticisms he had faced in the best way he knew how.Second, I don't care for the zombie apocalypse trope that men will revert into rapists as soon as the outbreak occurs. Will some become takers and rule by strength? Seems likely. But I can't see the everyman, after losing everyone who he holds dear, being like, \"Hell, I've lost everyone I loved yesterday. Let's go commit an atrocious crime against women today.\" The author admits his views here are conjecture. And my views that I don't see this as being likely, particularly not to the scale we see it in this book, are also conjecture. So who's right? No one - it's a matter of opinion. But the concept of men being racists in a zombie apocalypse has been played out.Overall, would I recommend this book? As the first in a currently nine-part series, no, but for fans of the zombie apocalypse genre, yes. It has great action, strong and relatable characters, and is fearless when it comes to tackling issues of race, politics, gender roles/stereotypes, etc. You may not agree with the author's DEPICTIONS (which should never be assumed to be the author's personal beliefs) of racism, sexism, and classism in America, but at least he has the cajones to make the reader consider them in a light he/she may not have before.3.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10378714-jen", "userReview": "Loved the characters!Could identify with speedy Sadie the most since I'm sure the author peeked into my life and stole her from my mirrro!

I'm not interested in long graphic rape/ harem fantasies - I mean side stories - in my zombie apocalypse books. If not for the wussy way the women were written and the extremely graphic abusive sexual content - this would have been an interesting group of survivors to follow. The excuse is always given that women WOULD be reduced to sexual objects and treated badly post apocalypse. Horsecrap. In a zombie infested world lots of man parts would be ripped off and chomped on too. Male genitals would have a pretty rough go of it either on the victims OR the zombies. Soft little bits that are external and barely attached... It would be penile mayhem. Creeped out yet? And yet I can only think of one book (Tufo's) where this has happened. Why? Because men would find these repeated fantasies - I mean descriptions - so distasteful and disturbing it would turn them off to the rest of the book. I'm stunned that it continues to surprise authors that women (and hopefully most men) would find women being reduced to their sexual parts and LOONG descriptions of their abuse equally unentertaining. By the way, all the women who are cops or in the military or just rural rednecks who had guns before they could walk would just give up, beg men to protect them, and join a harem?

No female characters (to the 55% point) are anything other than women who have understood that their worth is only measured by their looks and anatomy and what they can 'provide' men in the sexual sense once the zombie apocalypse happens.The military isn't portrayed any better. According to this author, once the zombie apocalypse happens, the core values of duty, honor, loyalty, selfless service, and personal courage simply disappear and the folks in uniform (mysteriously devoid of females) turn into little despots, running about and taking civilian's food, weapons, and women.

It's going to be brutal, it's going to portray people and indeed the military harsh, but if times of strife and war have any indication, a lot of this is how most people would see things. During bad times, bad people will do extremely bad things. I didn't see anything too bad but that's just me. It's going to be a harsh world so bear that in mind when starting it! Other than that, it's a good Zombie tale and one that grabbed me. I liked all the characters, yes, even the bad ones because they were all so well written. I enjoyed the plot too.

The writing is actually ok. It's the obvious disdain for women, minorities and government that got me.Edit*For some reason I still come back to this review and want to lower my rating because the book p*ssed me off so much. Instead, I'm going to recommend others for you to try; there are so many zombie apocalypse books/series out there to try, don't waste your time on this one. Try The Extinction series by Nicholas Sansbury Smith (my favorite!), The Voodoo Plague by Dirk Patton (the main character is awesome, over the top at times, but in a great way), and The Green Fields by Adrienne Lector (main character is hilarious and annoying at the same time, as intended, and the story is terrific). Also I recently started the Arisen series and blew threw it - very well done and man have I learned a ton about military, boats, and vehicles without even thinking about it.Now, onto the review...For those that argue they didn't think the misogyny was that bad because rape is part of war and blah blah blah, it is not about just rape, it's the general attitude toward women that got to me, including the author's. From the author's point of view, all women are good for during an apocalypse is sex. Seriously, that is it. The only woman who is not a sex object in this book (including a teenage girl / daughter figure) is an incompetent, crazy woman in a position of authority. God help us all, right? The rest of the women spend their times during the apocalypse playing with each other's hair, trying to keep up their appearances for the remaining men, and driving trucks wrong. God forbid they learn how to use a gun since they are too weak to use a crossbow, and even if they do, they shoot wrong. I was offended as I feel this is how the author truly views women. I've met guys like him before, dated them - they like women but don't LIKE women. The worst part was that even after I got into the book and finished it with a semi-smile on my face, I made the mistake of reading his after word, which he used as justification as to how he is not racist or misogynist. I mean, he has one black man in a powerful position who is not a complete buffoon, so of course he's not racist, right? And women \"have been prostituting themselves for centuries\" so of course he's not sexist, right? Gag! This guy needs to take a good hard look at himself. He is actually a talented writer, but his own personal opinions come across on the pages too readily."}, {"userName": "Barry Bash", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69062245-barry-bash", "userReview": "Loved it got hooked on the 1st book reading the 10th one now!"}, {"userName": "Bonnie Moen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27767636-bonnie-moen", "userReview": "I really enjoyed the book!I gave it 5 stars because I really liked the book!

The first time, the book was in a 10-book sampler of zombie books that I got from Amazon. I almost stopped after the first sentence, which is a run on. I did stop about 20% through the book because the run ons continued and the early characters were clearly developing in racist, sexist, and homophobic directions. After reading dozens of zombie books in many other series, I was looking for something new and ended up purchasing the first three books in this series, not realizing I had already given up on the first book. This time I persevered and finished the first two books. It's sad that so much possibility is lost by this author's need to slather this series in his right-wing worldview. After the first book I thought some of this was just a beginning-author's clumsiness, but it became clear to me in the second book that it's entirely intentional. The things I've learned so far include: A woman's place is in the home raising children; working women will spend their precious post-apocalyptic energy feeling guilty about having had careers; racism is mostly a figment of black people's paranoid delusions; racism is initiated by minorities; sniveling, effeminate men are useless and, when straight, don't particularly like gays, who would likely be their only allies against bullying; and black people aren't very religious and attracted to satanism. This author is so racist that he basically believes that racism is the most likely human accomplishment to survive an apocalypse. I don't know if I can keep reading.

Meredith's take on the zombie apocalypse is brutal and unrelenting. His characters make compromises in the name of survival. Compromises that would be unthinkable were it not for the fact that the entire world is being consumed by the dead. A global nightmare that is unleashed with the bungled handling of a biological weapon that shouldn't have existed and yet did. A weapon that is sold to terrorists who unleash it in their stupidity. What follows are the trials and tribulations of a varied assortment of people who somehow survive. These people, these characters, are well realized and the perils and dangers they face make for a page turner.Some of the events depicted in Meredith's tale, especially those having to do with the political and military response to the crisis, ring brutally true. It's not an uplifting tale of heroes and heroines, it's a tale of survival. Those survivors were interesting. I found myself invested in them.

Whilst this isn't the best example I've read, it's properly written and a cut above much of the dross available.Reading the reviews I couldn't help noticing that a number of people made a fuss about the supposed misogynistic tone of the book. There is violence against women in the book, and against men, and female body parts are sometimes noticed and mentioned, but it's just a part of the book and not even a big part.After finishing the book and reading the reviews I'm surprised that some readers made such a fuss about the supposed sexism. It's almost as if some people are determined to find things to be offended by. This is a work of fiction, fantasy, and the author can write what he likes. Just in case any unsuspecting readers think that the PA/Zombie genre is all about gentle romance, the author makes it clear what to expect at the start.With the mini-rant over, I'd like to make it clear that my rating is based on the novel as a whole, after choosing it with full awareness of the subject matter. Yet again mankind has developed a deadly virus that gets loose and spreads like wildfire , and wouldn't you know it the world (and North America in particular) is awash with zombies.Peter Meredith follows the tried and tested formula of having several characters going on variations of road trips as they struggle to survive as humanity falls apart. Some of these characters meet up and band together, making friends and enemies and enduring a series of perilous adventures. Meanwhile, the few bastions of authority that remain all have their own ideas about how to move forward and naturally they're all different.PA/Zombie veterans will find that no new ground has been broken here, but to be fair there isn't much left to break.

However...The rampant stereotypes (the gender ones were much more prolific and cringe-worthy than the racist ones), kept jarring me out of the story, which had a decent plot with some nice suspense and action bits. Essentially the characters' genders/ age spoke louder than their personalities and just didn't jive with the previous descriptions of their character and background. The female character when on their own are independent and able, however they magically turn into moony damsels in distress types when around the male characters. The \"differences\" between men and women are shoved so much down the readers' throats that it reads like a 1950's advert, with even less character development.

I could stomach it if it was at least presented in a campy, tongue-in-cheek manner, but it was written in a way that I suspect was an actual perspective of the author...there were several instances in the book in which you are subjected to the author's opinions and IMO that is equivalent to a bucket of water in the face when you are trying to stay in the story's world. The character I liked the most, mainly because he was less of a puppet to his gender, was Neil. I felt he had the most unique and developed personality. Sadie, who is 17 years old, acts and talks like a 10 year old and is constantly admonished by her \"apocalypse parents\" when she says a bad word; and she shamefacedly apologizes each time. 17 year olds don't act like that, and most adults (especially who are not their parents) don't treat them like that. She is described as \"goth\", but it never goes into detail as to what makes her \"goth\", and her character dialogue and actions don't support that image. It's as if the author chose the most stereotypical teen trope and slapped it on willy-nilly. It's this constant disassociation with who the characters are supposed to be, and how they are written that caused me to rate it. I would give it 2 1/2 stars if it let me because I did enjoy the non-stop action, the storyline, and the interweaving of the characters' journey, and the writing itself wasn't bad (except for 75% of the dialogue)."}], "description": "The Apocalypse--The Undead World: Novel 1 Money, terrorism, and simple bad luck conspire to bring mankind to its knees as a viral infection spreads out of control, reducing those infected to undead horrors that feed upon the rest.
