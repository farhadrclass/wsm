This is his second Neal Carey and it's a good one. Neal's job is to find a agri-scientist who had disappeared. He ends up in China, in Hong Kong's underground. But, even more fascinating than Winslow's plot is his voice - his way with words. I have three more Winslow's yet to read and just heard he's got a new one out this Spring. YES! Edited in 2011I started keeping track of the books I read, with mini reviews, in 2005 so I would quit buying the same ones over and over again. For the most part it worked. But, about a month ago, I bought this book - no clue why I didn't check my goodreads first - again. This time I found it horrible. I couldn't even get through the thing. I logged onto goodreads only to find out that it was only about 15 years ago that I loved it.

It Is more of a thriller than a mystery, and moves along at a lively clip. The book begins where the last left off, but quickly changes setting to Hong Kong and the People's Republic of China. The author manages to supply quite a lot of information about Chinese culture and history without slowing down the pace of the book too much. I was fascinated.

The action and intrigue and everything is really great. But the premise is TERRIBLE. SO SO SO SO SO BAD. I cannot emphasize enough how absolutely unbelievable this whole book is because the basic driver of the action is the dumbest thing ever. A number of times I almost put it down, because it was so stupid. The fact this book gets any stars is because it is otherwise fun, has some crazy international manipulation, and some great twists and turns.The first and very annoying thing, is that in the first two Neal Carey books, it starts with him reflecting on how he wishes he had never answered the door when \"Dad\" came calling. Neal finds people for the less than legal and reputable side of a bank that holds many very powerful people's money. So when his handler comes by, he always knows he should just get lost and not answer, but he always does what they say. This is stupid and Winslow should cut it out. Just have him do the job, even if begrudgingly, and not talk about how he knows he shouldn't. Just say he hates the jobs, but knows he has to do it. But that part is just annoying.So here is what happens. Neal is forced to go to SF and track down some scientist who has left his company to run away with some beautiful Chinese woman, Li Lan. So he goes, finds them, asks him to come back. The couple runs, Neal almost gets killed by what he assumes to be Li Lan, and his people tell him to just go home. This is where Winslow blows the entire story.Neal falls in love with Li Lan over the course of one evening. An evening which he spent with her and her boyfriend, and in which he thinks she tried to kill him. She basically almost gets him killed, and it usually looks like she is trying to kill him, and shows no interest in him throughout the story, but Neal is sooooo in love with her that he just keeps following. This is the dumbest thing ever. This is like a terrible terrible plot construction that might work with 8 year old girls. It completely ruins the book. He just keeps following her and thinking he loves her even after a shot at him while in her hot tub, a group of her hired goons tries to kill him, she leaves him to rot as a prisoner in a horrible slum, and in the end he risks his life for her twin, because he loves her. THIS IS SO STUPID. SERIOUSLY THE MOST PATHETIC PLOT DRIVING MECHANISM IN THE HISTORY OF WRITING. AT NO POINT DOES IT MAKE ANY SENSE OR IS EVEN REMOTELY BELIEVABLE.This book seriously deserves 0 stars. But I find Winslow so entertaining and I love the master plan of the Chinese secretary of something and the general CIA vs China plot lines."}, {"userName": "LJ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/250195-lj", "userReview": "THE TRAIL TO BUDDHA's MIRROR - ExWinslow, Don - 2nd Neal Carey bookRobert Pendleton is a chemical genius with a fertilizer worth a fortune to whoever controls the formula.

Carey is sort of an amateur detective who sort of works for the \"friends\" department of a stuffy New England bank. That is, friends whose problems the bank takes care of. The first book in the series had set out Carey's background and training through a series of flashbacks. This book is light on flashbacks but heavy on wild changes in plot. It takes Carey from The Golden Gate city to the hot tubs of Marin County to the slums of the Walled City in Hong Kong. It gives the reader an in -depth account of the Chinese cultural revolution and taps into China's overpopulation and Pollution problems. It involves the CIA, triads, and Maoist separatists.However, somewhere along the way, the plot became rather twisted and different. Is it a detective novel?

Fa strano leggere un libro che ormai \u00e8 storia, dove si parla ancora di videocassette o di ammennicoli che ormai sono in disuso da anni, ma le storie di Winslow anche se riproposte, non sfigurano mai, tanto da portare gli editori di Einaudi a pubblicare immediatamente il secondo volume dopo appena un paio di mesi dall\u2019uscita di London Underground. Nel primo volume Winslow ci racconta la crescita di Neal Carey, da ragazzino di strada a ragazzo, universitario e affiliato agli Amici di Famiglia, una specie di societ\u00e0 segreta di investigazioni, sempre in bilico tra legalit\u00e0 e illegalit\u00e0, tra sistemi pi\u00f9 o meno accettabili. In London Underground l\u2019avevamo visto alle prese con la scomparsa della figlia di un senatore degli Stati Uniti, e in questo secondo lo ritroviamo tranquillo alle prese con libri antichi in un cottage inglese, dopo che gli \u00e8 stato ordinato di darsi per un po\u2019 alla macchia. Ma gli Amici di Famiglia sanno come farti tornare sui tuoi passi, e quel che interessa a Neal \u00e8 riuscire finalmente ad ottenere la sua Laurea in Letteratura Inglese del XVIII secolo, quindi nominare parole come universit\u00e0 e laurea lo porta ad accettare qualsiasi incarico. Anche stavolta gli Amici di Famiglia, fanno leva sulla voglia di Neal di finire quello che ha iniziato. Questa volta ha l\u2019incarico di ritrovare Robert Pendleton, un talento nel campo della chimica, soprattutto nella sinterizzazione di fertilizzanti che rendono una fortuna ai suoi investitori. Pendetlon risulta scomparso, senza aver lasciato traccia, dopo essere stato ad un convegno a San Francisco. Sta a Neal ritrovarlo e riportarlo all\u2019ovile, ma come al solito non sar\u00e0 una cosa semplicissima. Neal dovr\u00e0 partire da San Francisco, volare ad Hong Kong, fino ad arrivare nella Cina pi\u00f9 remota e rurale, in un viaggio avventuroso, accompagnato, non proprio amichevolmente dalla Cia, dal governo cinese e da un\u2019organizzazione segreta letale. A complicare le cose ci sar\u00e0 anche l\u2019affascinante Li Lan, che fino all\u2019ultimo non si riuscir\u00e0 a capire se sia vittima o carnefice. Lo stile di Winslow era in questi primi romanzi ancora un po\u2019 acerbo, ma gi\u00e0 si intravedeva quello che ora \u00e8 lo scrittore di capolavori come \u201cIl potere del cane\u201d, \u201cIl Cartello\u201d e \u201cL\u2019inverno di Frankie Machine\u201d.

This one is the second in a series of PI tales featuring twenty-something literary hermit and goofball daredevil Neil Carey. It took a few discs to gain any altitude, and never neared the heights of Winslow's later prose style, characters and tone, although the bones of the intense scene-focused narrative drive emerged as the shaggy dog story finally found its way to Hong Kong and China, the actual focus of the mystery. I was annoyed by Winslow's insistent, nearly constant internal monologue inside the protagonist's head, even though the novel is in close-third person. Too cute by half. If Carey's thoughts really mattered, why not use first-person? If they don't, which is the case here, just cut to the chase. I mean, literally, there were times when Winslow felt the need for his Carey character to comment on every line of dialog from every other character. This tic of an insecure novelist receded as the action heated up. What I liked about the book was the blend of the world-historic uber story -- the power struggle in China after the demise of the Red Guards -- with an adventure tale of suspense and danger. Preposterously implausible. Yes. Fun?
