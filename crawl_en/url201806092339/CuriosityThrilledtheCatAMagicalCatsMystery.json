Cats, libraries and books are a winning trifecta, and they tend to complement each other, especially well when these three elements apply to mystery novels. So, it\u2019s no surprise that there is no shortage of mystery series, especially in the cozy genre, featuring cats, books, and libraries, in one combination or another. I wasn\u2019t sure about this series when it was recommended to me, because, although I love it when pets and animals have a role in a story, I\u2019m not especially fond of the magical or paranormal elements, since, well, it\u2019s just too silly for me. But, in this case, I found the entire story very charming. The mystery is solid, well plotted, with quick pacing, strong dialogue, with a little humor sprinkled in along the way. Hercules and Owen, Kathleen Paulson\u2019s adopted cats, are \u2018special\u2019, and they do help Kathleen find clues, in small ways, but I found myself caught up in the spirt of the book, and enjoyed the pure whimsy of it. In fact, the cats are what made the book so utterly charming. Kathleen is a likeable character who is licking her wounds after a bad break up, and adjusting to small town life, as well as her decision to try a super short hairdo, which is driving her nuts. (I can relate!) Her new job as the town\u2019s librarian is fraught with a plethora of issues due to a major renovation, which is not going so well. But, when Kathleen finds the body of a famous, and difficult, musical conductor, things get a whole lot worse when she discovers she is suspect number one. Things get dicey from there as she copes with Marcus, the detective working the case, and a string of \u2018accidents\u2019, as well as feeling as though someone doesn\u2019t want the library renovated, for some reason. This first book in a series, sets the stage for future installments, giving it a nice foundation to build on. So, overall, this one turned out to be an unexpected pleasure, so I\u2019ll be adding yet another series to my enormous TBR pile. 3.5 stars"}, {"userName": "\u2728Susan\u2728", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21276121-susan", "userReview": "This was a fun, cozy, murder mystery that had a good story. I thought it might be silly because of the special kitty's but it had just enough magic to keep it funny but not over the top ridiculous. Two cats adopt and make themselves comfortable in the home of a young woman who is new to a small town, where she has been hired to be the new librarian. She's not sure why or where they came from but they are sweet, ornery, and funny. She likes having them around to keep her company and they seem to love her. While her library is undergoing a renovation, she arrives one morning to find a semi famous conductor, who is not liked by many, dead on the floor with no visible cause of death. When the elusive, local detective starts his investigation, this small town's unexpected secrets start to surface and the long time citizens start to suspect eachother. Charming, likable characters kept the story interesting and Cassandra Cambell's narration was perfect for this lively, light cozy. This was a great Daily Deal and hope there is more to come."}, {"userName": "Leila", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15194189-leila", "userReview": "I read this book quite quickly. It is a pleasant but very light, gentle and easy read...with mainly five star reviews. I think it will appeal on the whole to cat lovers. Without adding spoilers all I will say is that the cats apparently have magical powers! Not to be taken too seriously I would think. Some of the 'dialogue' between Kathleen (the main character) and her two cats is quite humorous. but a lot of the dialogue and the events happening between Kathleen and her little collection of female friends is a little boring. Perhaps a book to pick up and read if not too well or in between or after completing something needing much more concentration and thoughtfulness. It is also super easy to work out who the killer is, with so few twists that when \"all is revealed\" at the end of the book it feels like an anticlimax. The premise seems to be that without the help of the cats the murder would not have been solved. There is a gradual love interest in a vague sort of way but not the most exciting development...Hmmm... A book then to take away and read on the plane or beside the pool when on holiday but on the whole not for the more serious reader."}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4063913-beth", "userReview": "[Also, why is it that only Kathleen was able to do this super basic digging-into-the-dead-guy stuff?

The first is that as a ~magical~ cats mystery I expected less derision towards \"crazy cat ladies\" because who else buys books about ~magical~ cats? Way to alienate your target audience. The second has to do with the pacing. It felt like we were wandering around town endlessly with Kathleen and her library renovations just wondering about who done it rather than her and her cats actively seeking out information.

I didn't read the book summary before this and I can't be sure whether that made me like it more or not. I need to be in the right mood for this genre and this one hit that spot.Our heroine is hired to oversee the restoration of the library and all kinds of weird things happen around her. The two cats living with her, Owen and Hercules, followed her home and adopted her. They bring the paranormal element into the story. It is the only thing that is paranormal and it is never in your face. The cats get just enough page time to make the story more colourful. I enjoyed that a lot. I am not a cat parson, but these two made this story even better.So, someone is murdered in the book and the pattern is the same as in all stories in the genre. The heroine thinks a lot about it. Tries to solve it, gets help from unexpected corners and so on. As I said, I quite enjoyed it even though you won't find anything special or surprising here. Next, I liked the potential love interest and I loved the idea of that just being hinted at. What I wasn't a fan of were the women in the book. Before the pitchforks come out, let me just say there is no way everyone being this nice and pleasant. Slut shaming is on one side of that line and this is its opposite. At times, every woman was so sweet my teeth hurt.Overall, if you're in the mood for a small town murder mystery, this might be the thing for you."}, {"userName": "Kevin", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1660832-kevin", "userReview": "Two cats in a small town \u201c400 miles north of everywhere\u201d with a literary protagonist, no it\u2019s not the newspaper reporter Qwill from the Cat Who series, this is Kathleen the head librarian and her two magical cats.

It was a book almost written for me and my silly cat, Oz. It was exactly the type of book I needed after reading a lot of dark and sort of heavy fantasy and science fiction lately, to say nothing of real life. Curiosity Thrilled the Cat was a light murder mystery type book, the type of book I devour like popcorn. The book was fairly mainstream, though did have a fantastical element... The cats in the story have magical powers. The magical powers seem to be related to where the cats are from and possibly the family who used to live there...but a lot of that is only alluded to in this book.The story is a fairly straight-forward murder mystery. Kathleen, a relative newcomer to a small town in Minnesota, is a librarian at a local library. The library is going through some major renovations, which serves as a secondary and tertiary plot device, though the main thrust is of course the murder. The murder victim is a visiting Composer and Conductor, a man named Easton who was in town to run the annual music festival in the town. Finding herself one of the prime suspects, Kathleen ends up doing some sleuthing on her own, though she is aided by her cats.Kathleen's cats are Owen and Hercules. Owen seems to have some powers of invisibility, while Hercules can literally walk through walls. Both also seem to understand humans and have a nose (an ear?) for what's going on and finding clues related to the mystery. The cats were necessary helpers for Kathleen solving the mystery, though the sub-plot of where they came from was also developed pretty carefully in this first-in-a-series of books set in the same town with the same people and cats. Kelly leaves some openings for the reader to make assumptions not only about Owen and Hercules but also about the other cats from the same place. Her text also suggests that the storied history of the home (now abandoned) that they were from may hold some magic, too.All in all, the mystery in the book was fairly predictable. I think I figured out \"whodunnit\" when Kelly dropped the first major clue--a clue found by Hercules. But even with that, the story was light and fun to read, the story-telling and world-building felt natural, and I looked forward to hearing how Kathleen finally put all the pieces together. Slightly less elegant was one of the secondary story lines, a sub-plot where the contractor working on the renovations at the library wanted to chase Kathleen away so that his girlfriend(?), the former head librarian, could resume the post that she'd quit. The secondary story didn't make much sense in the context of this book, but may play a role in the larger plot of the series.Cassandra Campbell's narration was fantastic. She's done the narration for many books with female leads, and it's no wonder why. Being a woman, her voice is a natural fit for the narration, unlike when some men do narration for mainly female roles and it feels forced or that they're trying to use a different tone for a \"woman's voice.\" She didn't try to use a different tone for the male voices, which was a good thing. It felt like she was reading the story to me and made it easy to listen to. I'm looking forward to listening to the next book in the series, which Campbell also narrates. What can I say? I'm kind of a crazy cat lady myself (with only one feral cat, thank you very much), and I'm a sucker for a fun murder mystery..."}, {"userName": "bella", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6827846-bella", "userReview": "CURIOSITY THRILLED THE CAT was one of those books that you hear about before release day, you get excited about it, buy it on release day and then it sits in your TBR pile. I was so excited when I heard about CURIOSITY THRILLED THE CAT that I raced to the bookstore and bought it. Of course it then spent quite a few months in the ever-growing reading well. Well lately I've had a bit of a reading slump and I was eyeing my shelves and saw it sitting there. I thought I would give it a go. I thought maybe those magical cats might get me out of my reading slump. And, guess what? THEY DID!CURIOSITY THRILLED THE CAT is the first book in the Magical Cats Mystery series and tells the story of a librarian, Kathleen, who has been adopted by two cats, Hercules and Owen (of course its cats that adopt us, not the other way around). Kathleen is working hard at the Mayville Heights Public Library, getting it restored, when suddenly she finds herself in the middle of a murder. Okay so I'm not going to be subtle. I adored every single page of this book. I LOVED Hercules and Owen, and yes by the way Hercules is named after Kevin Sorbo (and if you don't understand this reference you are far too young!). They are full of so much mischief, and remind me of my own cats. I loved their magical, supernatural powers (which I won't spill - you have to read the book to find out!).Adorable cats aside, I fell completely smitten for Mayville Heights. Being the first book in the series, Sofie Kelly, introduces us to a lot of fun, quirky characters in the town. Each time I met a new character I kept thinking \"oh don't be the murderer\" because I want to read more about these delightful people again and again. As to the murder mystery itself, it was very enjoyable, and nope I didn't guess who did it, although towards the end I did get very close. It wasn't too predictable at all, and I had fun finding out who did it right alongside Kathleen.I've already picked up SLEIGHT OF PAW from the library, and intend to start it very soon."}, {"userName": "Karen B.", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5230033-karen-b", "userReview": "This is the first book I have read in the series and I can tell I will be back for more. Kathleen Paulson has left her life in Boston, wanting to escape from a heartbreak when her boyfriend ends up marrying someone else. She comes to Mayville Heights Minnesota to be the new head librarian overseeing the restoration of the original library. When she first arrived she encountered a very old house which is apparently home to a colony of feral cats. Two of the kittens come out to see her and \"adopt\" Kathleen by following her home from the house which is odd because they are feral cats. It seems that the cats, Owen and Hercules, have the ability to understand what Kathleen says. When a murder occurs in Mayville Heights and Kathleen is the one to discover the body, the cats seem to want to help save their \"mom\" from being a suspect. They do things like sneak into her bag and go with her to the library and find little clues they present to her. (they do much more as well but ... spoilers...) . Kathleen makes friends in Mayville and I love her friends and their loyalty to her. I liked this book because of these friendships and Kathleen's being accepted and loved by these new neighbors. But mostly I enjoyed the cats because they are magical. Yes, you have to air of suspension of disbelief to accept their magical ability. But it is not too overdone.

The series title (Magical Cats) warned me in advance to suspend disbelief while the two feline heroes of the book demonstrated their amazing abilities.I did, however, think the author should have given more thought to the naming of her characters. Owen is one of the protagonist's cats and Oren is one of the suspects. This reader had to concentrate too hard to keep the Owen/Oren duo straight. Then there was the trio of Harry, Harry and Larry - a father and two sons - who also figured into the intrigue. I was probably halfway through the book before I was able to keep straight that Roma was the vet and Rebecca was the neighbor. The book hosts an ample cast of characters and the author would have done a service to her readers by making them more readily distiguishable from each other.I read this book primarily because it was the selection for a reading group to which I belong.

I truly am a sucker for kitty cats in a novel, especially those in a cozy mystery who help their \"person\" ferret out clues to solve the murder. I said their person for a reason: a cat or kitten usually chooses his or her person. All of my cats have done so. Meet Owen. He's a grey tabby who is addicted to Catnip. He has a knack of suddenly disappearing/reappearing. Meet Hercules. He's a stocky Tuxedo cat who loves Barry Manilow and dances with his owner to his tunes. He has no interest in catnip like his brother, but he does get into or out of places not the way any old cat can.Both cats have special powers and reveal them slowly to their person, Kathleen Paulson. She is Mayville Heights, MN newest Head Librarian and in charge of the 100 year old Carnegie library as well as its renovation. But construction is way behind schedule and strange accidents in the library always seem to find Kathleen as their victim.The murder of the guest conductor for the Mayville Music Festival has everyone talking. He wasn't a nice man. And Kathleen had words with him in the library the night he died. She'd ordered breakfast for him too. And she was the one to find his body. If those facts don't make her the Number One Suspect, the note found in the dead man's pocket certainly will.Kathleen will need help proving her innocence. Owen and Hercules are ready.Sofie Kelly interjects bone-dry humor all through the novel. And the magical powers of Owen and Hercules aren't far-fetched. When they reveal what they can do to Kathleen, I chuckled. And I laughed at the Funky Fred the Chicken scenes until I cried. My own Bonnie and Clyde would be catnip junkies too given their choice. For a cozy-mystery, the pace of the story was fast. There are the red herrings, but the \"whodunnit\" really surprised me. The characters are great. So well developed that I really wish there was a Mayville Heights, Kathleen, Maggie, Roma, Rebecca, Ami, Marcus, Susan, Everett...you get the picture.

It's so average, it's formulaic.This book is a murder mystery, set around a library, a librarian, a small town, a conductor and some cats. The cats purportedly have magic powers, something that plays much less of a role in the story than it should. I think that, if there were more about the cats, this might even have been a four star story.As it was, it was absolutely average, right down to them identifying the wrong man as the killer and the last minute unmasking of the correct killer who was, of course, someone no one would ever suspect. To be fair, it was a crime of opportunity, rather than a premeditated murder; if the first man hadn't done his thing, then the murder could never have occurred. But he did and it did.The magic cats really did help the story, which was otherwise chatter about boring small town lives. If the heroine hadn't had interesting actor parents and her cats, the first three quarters of the book (before the action started heating up) would have been insufferably slow.

I'm the one that...disappears...Actually, I think I was asked to tell the story about the murder because I set up the storyline, sort of... You see, I jumped and appeared on the head of Gregor Easton. No, it wasn't a head statue, it was the real guy, who just happened to be criticizing my Mom at the time! I had to do something, didn't I?Mom had been hired to become the head librarian and oversee a major renovation to The Mayville Heights Free Public Library. It was almost done but the contractor seemed to be taking sooooo long. And that had caused Gregor Easton, a well-known composer and conductor who was guest artist for the Wild Rose Summer Music Festival, to be frustrated because no internet access, as promised in the new brochure, was yet available!Although things became calm and Easton finally left, Mom was concerned enough to get up early the next day and go to find an independent contractor, Oren, to ask for his help in getting the computer tables put together and try to move the renovation along while the main contractor handled the power. She knew Oren worked mornings at the Stratton Theatre. But she couldn't find Oren right away and started looking. She found, instead, Gregor Easton...He was dead!Worse, a note was later found that indicated that Mom had invited Gregor to meet her at the Library, where the police found other clues that revealed that he had probably been killed there!Mom was in bigggg trouble, so Herc and I knew we had to help. We took turns guarding Mom because she decided she was going to try to find out what was really going on since she knew she was a suspect! But while we were doing it, Mom caught on to our secrets big-time! We were busted! But Hercules was to blame! Let her tell you...\"My knees started to shake. I sat down. Hard. Hercules had vanished. He hadn't darted past me. He hadn't run around the corner. He'd walked through a solid wooden door just as if it wasn't there. I could see it again in my head without closing my eyes. He'd vanished through that door and it was almost as though there was a faint pop as the end of his tail disappeared...\" Hercules,\" I called. \"C'mon, puss. Where are you?\" There was silence and then a faint \"Meow\" from the other side of the closed door. He was in there. Somehow he was in there. I grabbed the doorknob. Locked. I twisted the knob in frustration. Of course it was locked. The room was part of a murder investigation...\"You all will see that both Herc and I found many clues--even though Mom didn't realize what they meant right away. Then she began to put things together until, wow, a killer came after her! Well, needless to say, we were right there to save her life. While Herc went for help, I took a flying leap--well, let Mom tell you, I get mad just thinking about it!\"Owen appeared in midair, teeth bared, ears flattened against his head. He landed, yowling on [the killer's] head and dug in his claws...\" Mom took over once she was able and then help was coming!I have to tell you, folks, that this was really a very complicated case. The police were trying, and we were gathering clues, but it was Mom who, after her own life had been saved, finally put together who had killed Easton. A truly great whodunit for all you readers!Oh, Mom thinks that you might want to know a little more about me and Herc. Well, Mom came to visit an old abandoned mansion near to her new home when we were just kits. We recognized her love as soon as we saw her and followed her home! But she didn't know we could do tricks...and, frankly, I'll bet she wonders sometime if we are ghost cats, since that old mansion is supposed to be haunted...I just know we'll be back at BRH in the future, cause the owner here loves cats too and even collects cat mystery books! How Cool is That! She said to add that this book is highly recommended as a great whodunit, especially for all of you who love cats too!Meow!Thanks for Inviting Me!OwenHey!

I have wanted to read this for a few years now but never got to it. The two little kitties are adorable. It's a pretty good cozy mystery. Great for a rainy afternoon or lying in a hammock under some trees. I liked the writing style and it had interesting characters. I did not guess the killer. YAY! I would like to read book two in the series. Gave me all the feel goods I look for in this type of cozy.Highly recommended to cat lovers and cozy mystery readers."}, {"userName": "LORI CASWELL", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4770012-lori-caswell", "userReview": "Kathleen Paulson needs to change her life NOW, her boyfriend goes away for two weeks and comes back MARRIED!!Kathleen chucks her life in Boston and accepts a job in Mayville Heights, Minnesota, to supervise the renovation and modernization of their library. This turns out to be no small task, but the job is just the kind of distraction she needs.Not long after her arrival in town she allows to stray cats two snuggle their way into her life. She names the tabby Owen and quickly learns he is addicted to catnip. The other is a stocky tuxedo cat she names Hercules. Hercules loves Barry Manilow music as much as Kathleen, but Owen hates Barry, no matter the song and has no trouble showing his distaste. It doesn't take Kathleen long to learn the cats are very special, maybe even magical.Life in quiet Mayville Heights takes a drastic turn when a guest of the Wild Rose Summer Music Festival is found dead. For some reason all the clues seem to point to Kathleen. It is then she finds out just how gifted her four legged feline friends are when they help her work to clear her name and quickly bring this caper to a close.I LIKED IT!!!!The first thing that really drew me into this book was the cover, the cat's piercing eyes. I have been trying this year to acknowledge the cover illustrators and designers, because book covers today are truly small works of art. There is no information on the artists for this cover but click on the picture, the cats eyes alone will have you wanting to read the story.The characters of Mayville Heights are so easy to enjoy from the quick wit of Roma, veterinarian by day to human doctor in a pinch, or coworker Abigail's sarcasm, and Detective Gordon's dry sense of humor. Add to that, loving neighbor Rebecca along with the newly transplanted Kathleen, the antics of her \"magical\" cats and so many more true characters in every sense of the word. There is someone for every reader to love or even hate as I do, the maddening contractor in charge of the renovation. As a former construction worker it took pure restraint not to jump right into the pages and slap him \"up aside the head\"!You can't go wrong with a cozy if you have characters like these, a really good mystery, the perfect setting of a library and magical cats. A wonderful debut for what I know will be a \"purrfectly\" \"cat-invating\" series. This author has written several young adult books and has now left a paw print in the cozy mystery world with this story and I am happy to welcome her and will anxiously awaiting her next feline escapade.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Obsidian/NAL, a Division of Penguin Publishing.

Owen is a tabby with a catnip addiction and Hercules is a stocky tuxedo cat who shares Kathleen's fondness for Barry Manilow. But beyond all the fur and purrs, there's something more to these felines.  When murder interrupts Mayville's Music Festival, Kathleen finds herself the prime suspect. More stunning is her realization that Owen and Hercules are magical-and she's relying on their skills to solve a purr-fect murder.", "title": "Curiosity Thrilled the Cat\n      \n          (A Magical Cats Mystery #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8730413-curiosity-thrilled-the-cat", "average": 3.93, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388196304l/8730413.jpg", "reviews": 548, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4161210.Sofie_Kelly", "name": "Sofie Kelly"}], "type": ["Mystery", "Mystery", "Animals", "Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8730413-curiosity-thrilled-the-cat", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24795395-curiosity-thrilled-the-cat", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10798360-curiosity-thrilled-the-cat", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10744247-sleight-of-paw", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12259507-copycat-killing", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15733495-cat-trick", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16087841-final-catcall", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18952971-a-midwinter-s-tail"]}
