Whenever Rune\u2019s around anything remotely supernatural, an angry pressure builds and she wants to know why\u2026 before she loses control. By order of an unknown council they are pulled through a portal into an alternate dimension where creatures of myth and legend exist. A realm that calls them, Venators.The review...I quite enjoyed this book. My brothers loved Dungeons and Dragons so I played that some with them and understand the world. This is like a D&D world but with vampires, werewolves, sirens and a whole host of races you'd find in an urban fantasy. This makes the world familiar but also a new take that is fascinating, especially when you throw in there the human Venators. Time was spent introducing us to the girl and guy who were chose to come represent Venators in this new world. I appreciated that as it helped me to really root for them big time when they took on their first big mission.We get a glimpse of a kickass villain and her minions with some pretty great battles, plus meet some other badies who are on their own side. It's the mix of allies though that I loved. Beltran, our vampire mentor and our mysterious guide who chose Grey and Rune who has his own agenda! Then we have the council and a whole host of supernatural beings who can swing either way. They all have magic and abilities and our two venators don't have all the knowledge they need... yet. And that translates into fun interactions and political jockeying that made this truly delightful and fun!Yes, I gave this a 4 star... Right now I haven't seen enough to say this is going to be the best... That familiar feeling can go either way in the second book... it can be blown aside with the introduction of more of the world building or it can sink into stereotypes found around supernatural races. BUT, don't let what could be coming keep you from enjoying this book! Seriously I loved the multiple POVs and I adored Grey from the get go... and Rune is a character to watch with a potential to grow into a kickass venator!Cover & Title grade -> B+You know I don't hate this cover. It has some stellar color on it and its got that paranormal vibe from urban fantasy. The thing is I don't exactly know who that is on the cover and I've read the book! It's kind of generic. Walking by I may not have picked it up... even the title is kind of ho-hum. They aren't bad but they don't draw me in. Some like The Venator Arch may have worked better. At least it gives the reader a concrete setting to draw out attention.As a Writer...As a writer I am a total fan of mixing genres and taking ideas that readers already know and putting a unique spin on them. Mixing paranormal races into a D&D setting sounds like fun and my first foray into the world was action packed and making me excited and hopeful for the next book!!The only problem with using old ideas in new ways is that it opens you up to have the new ways compared to the old ways. Yes, all ideas are being revamped these days but with this you are clearly comparing vampires to vampires. It's a bold move and works with how the world works and where folklore on earth came from for supernatural creatures. As a writer I LOVE bold moves and hope it works even better in book #2!!Magic Unleashed is a pretty fun ride through a new world that is closely aligned with our own. Be prepared for adventures with all manner of supernatural races and creatures. Diplomacy and action will be skills you need to develop, along with the judgement to know when to use which! GAH! Get me the next book STAT! \u22c6 \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Authenticity\u22c6 \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Writing Style\u22c6 \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Plot & Pacing\u22c6 \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 World BuildingThanks to Edelweiss and the publisher for providing me with a copy in exchange for an honest review.

Thank you so much, Devri Walls!So first of all, I love fantasy and new worlds! This book takes you into a magical new world were all legends come to life. That kind of reminded me of the shadowhunters quote \"all legends are true\", but trust me there is soo much more in the world of Eon. It's a parallel dimension where every creature you could think of exists and even beyond that. The two main Characters are called Venators and are part of a species that was evil in the past and now have been brought back to Eon - or rather kidnapped from Earth - to save the planet. I had a good feeling about Grey, the male character, from the beginning. There just had to be more to him. His super trained body, knowledge of the supernatural world and sense of justice was revealed later and made me like him more. Rune, the female character, was keeping everything under control at first and showed how strong she really was. But I always thought the Grey would be the leader of the both of them. Well, guess in some situations Rune can kick more ass than Grey and put on a better show for their keepers, the corrupt council of Eon. Of course, I thought there would be something going on between Rune and Grey, but then a third party came into the picture: Beltran! He's an adorable, cocky shape-shifter that definitely has an eye for Rune. It seems that she is the only reason he helps the Venators at all. I wonder where this love triangle will go! :)The end of the first book shocked me a little or rather let me rethink my feelings about Grey. What is he up to and does he really know what he's getting into? Also, a nice treat was the first chapter of the second book at the end. Finally, you heard something about Ryker Runes brother - the reason why Rune went along to Eon. Hopefully, their sibling bond will not totally be destroyed and Ryker will come to his senses. Can't wait to see how the story continues.I know it is always hard to create a new world and if the story is supposed to be in a series the first book tends to lack a little bit of more tension. The further I read the more I liked the book and could relate to the story better because of the descriptions of this new world that compared things to our world. This always makes a reader get hooked faster to the story. Although I really like this new world I wished it had more exciting situations and tension which build up in the second half of the book. Also, just a side note: I had to go on a reading break because of assignments for uni otherwise I would have finished this book much faster! So everybody out there who's in love with all things supernatural definitely check out this new world of Eon!!"}, {"userName": "Faith The Assassin", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30045314-faith-the-assassin", "userReview": "Once again, I am blown away by Devri Wall's writing style and how she weaves these amazing stories with such creative and unique worlds and such interesting characters. First The Solus Series, then The Wizard's Heir and now this- Venators: Through the Arch- all which I have enjoyed immensely.Venators was such a fun and captivating read. Such a unique take on the paranormal/fantasy genre. I really enjoyed every thing this story had to offer- the unique world building, the characters that continue to develop in such a beautiful way, and just how fast paced it is.Venators follows the stories of two characters; Grey and Rune. Where in the beginning, the are living the usual college life but then are called to jump through an arch into a different world. A world that has every kind of mythical creature you can imagine - vampires, werewolves, faeries, elves, Wizards, dragons, goblins and even Giants. And they are called to be what is known as the Venators, which is Latin for hunter. And they are called to be basically the Warriors and law of the land.This was such a fast paced and thrilling story I didn't want to put it down.Now let's talk about how awesome the characters are. Because the way Devri creates such awesome characters is something to be discussed.Rune- Rune is our female protagonist. For a while, it took me while to connect or really enjoy her character because she kind of starts out as a weak character. The whole reason , she agreed to enter this strange world is because her twin brother Ryker has been taken. And she's always been the one to look after and take of him and she's got to get him back. But she constantly freaked out in most situations. I don't think it was until more towards end of the book that I began to like her because she's slowly shedding that weak and scared girl she was in the beginning and she's starting to become really badass and I love it. Grey- Aw Grey. Where do I begin? Grey is an amazing character. Very handsome too. Six years ago, he was already introduced to this new world by an attack from some of the creatures that came through to his side. And he's always been curious to go to this other world. And no matter what the situation is, he really knows how to handle it. He's sweet and compassionate and a fast learner. And he handles everything in such a calmly matter. He really thinks things through instead of caving into pressure. He's just an all around amazing guy and I can't wait to see how he continues to develop throughout.Beltran- my personal favorite. I love Grey, but the minute this character was introduced, I knew he was a keeper. He's kind of your troublemaker , bad boy not entirely certain you can trust him kind of character which I absolutely love those kind of characters. He's witty, and fun but he's also really smart and kind. And I call dibs on this guy so nobody else gets to have him .This story is also told from other point of views aside from the main two which I really enjoy because I love seeing the different thoughts and getting to know all the characters .I would really recommend it to those who love fantasy and looking for something that's a little different then your usual story.I really enjoyed this book so much and I can't wait for more!!!! Thanks Devri again for yet another exciting story and such amazing characters. Can't wait to see how this story progresses! Beltran forever!!!"}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10667189-kim", "userReview": "Venators is going down as my favorite Devri Walls novel so far! When I talked to Devri last fall, she said her next book would have a little bit of everything in it... and she wasn't kidding! Vampires, dangerous werewolves (not like the kind I see in so many other novels lately), fairies, goblins, dragons.... you name it, it's there! But, it's not \"too much\" either. Devri creates the world in a way that it all fits together, so it's not just a pile of mish-mash thrown together hoping to reach a variety of readers. It really does work well together, and the world feels real to me. It's intriguing, intimidating and honestly a little frightening! Venators is well written, was easy to get pulled into (and hard to put down!), and full of twists and mystery. It sets the stage nicely for the series and makes me want more right away. The story is a fast paced ride full of adventure, mystery, and danger. The whole story takes place over a short span of time, but the characters personalities shine enough that you can \"see\" them, quirks and all, by the end of the story. It's easy to like Rune and Grey when they are the stars of the story, but Tate, Verida and Beltrain helped bring the story to life in their own way, too. Actually, I think Beltran was my favorite character... he's a prank-loving trouble-maker who thinks rules don't apply to him. He's also a shapeshifter, with a touch of softness somewhere deep within him. Enough to help strangers, and care... really care. I look forward to seeing him develop in the series. There are secrets with Tate and Verida's lives that I think will come out later in the story, too, and add depth to who they are. The mystery of those two kept drawing me in, begging me to pay closer attention, just in case I could pick up on more of them.The story moved very fast, and there were scenes that definitely had my heart pumping. It was not your traditional girl-runs-into-danger-boy-goes-to-save-her and everything ends light and happy. There is manipulation, deep wounds that need cleaned out to heal, and bartering that may cost lives. I probably sound like nerd-fan girl but I can't wait for book two already. Thanks for taking me on another great journey, Devri! I love your style!"}, {"userName": "Indira", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22886341-indira", "userReview": "Hey guys, so I just finished Venators:Magic Unleashed(used to be Through The Arch) (#1) by Devri Walls. I have no idea why it took me so long to read this amazing novel. Seriously, I loved her other series, why did I have any doubt that I wouldn't enjoy this one? Silly me. So obviously, I loved this novel. It was descriptive, but I liked how...causal it was. It wasn't too fancy or hard to read. The description added essential background information to the characters that I grew to love. Oy, let me tell ya, this book had no shortage of surprises and shocks embedded in the cream pages. In addition, it had lots of action, mostly battles, which were wonderfully written and not boring at all. I didn't get lost in the battle scenes, I felt like I was battling alongside them. Basically, I was sucked into this novel from the very beginning. I just, couldn't put this book down. I probably would have read it in a day if I didn't have other duties to attend to. Okay, that felt like I went off in a tangent..oh well. Anyway. This book also had traces of romance. Not sure if the romance is coming from me, or the characters though, lol! Speaking of the characters, I just can't wait to ask the author how she developed these adorable and scarred babies. Grey. Oh baby Grey. My heart aches for you...and then Beltran! Gah! My heart beats for your cocky and witty attitude that probably hides a horror filled past as well. And then Tate, poor little guy, already g0ne through so much, I just want the author to give you a happy ending. Sighs. Alright..I should probably stop typing before I spoiler something for you guys. I just can't wait to read the second book.. I need me some BeltranXRune.

Devri Walls is setting up what promises to be an amazing series with Magic Unleashes, the first part of a Venators series.What is a Venator you ask? A Venator is quite powerful as it turns out and is immune to vampire bites, fae magic, and werewolf venom - amongst other things. They are the enforcers of the law in another realm and beings to be feared. Except they are all but extinct in this other realm. Grey is beginning to discover his Venator abilities in the human world. While Rune knows something is boiling deep inside her but doesn't know what exactly.And then, just like that the explosive action whisks the two into a dark fantasy world where all sorts of creatures dwell. Grey and Rune are ripped from their collegiate lives and taken to a land on the brink of war as different species vie for power. In a race to get to the ruling council house Grey and Rune discover just how dangerous the place is. And Rune begins to see the shy, timid Grey in a much different light. Both Venators have a strong sense of right and justice and that puts them at odds with some of the ruling Council members. I am eagerly looking forward to the next installment of this series and I can't wait to try out another of Devri Walls' books. Fantastically paced writing with humor, intrigue and adventure.

Though I wasn\u2019t particularly a huge fan of it, I did prefer it than a new chapter each time the POV switched.My biggest issue with this book was Rune\u2019s initial response to the monsters at the beginning of the book. Yes, she has her \u2018itch\u2019, but she had no logical explanation for it. Just because she becomes skittish around supernatural photographs, doesn\u2019t elude to the fact they exist. When the supernatural monsters do appear, Rune doesn\u2019t even flinch. Sure, she is a little shellshocked, but not nearly as much as one would think she would. Yes, her \u2018itch\u2019 may have increased her skepticism a little, but again, she wouldn\u2019t be quite as calm.Besides that, I found myself flying through the book.

Tate (and some others) comes back to check up on Grey and let him know about his destiny. In the meantime, Grey's discovered he has some strange supernatural abilities -- and has been teaching himself to use them in secret -- he's also been doing some research into the supernatural in the open, which is not such a great idea for a socially awkward teen -- he might as well attach a \"Kick Me\" sign to his back himself.About the same time, Rune's twin, Ryker starts acting a little strange (and definitely takes advantage of the metaphorical \"Kick Me\" sign). Rune starts to feel differently about her brother and the supernatural, but there's nothing she can put her finger on -- so she bows to parental pressure and devotes herself to three things: academics, sports, and keeping Ryker from self-destruction. She excels at all three.Six years later, the three are in college and Tate returns to bring Rune and Grey back to his world. A world where they are Venators (hunters) -- keeping the vampires, werewolves, goblins, elves, fae, dragons, etc. in line. Eon is home to pretty much every mythological creature you can think of -- and a few that Walls has invented on her own. The Venators are a line of human hunters supernaturally immune to the various abilities and magics of them all, whose duty it is to keep order in the land. For various and sundry (largely undisclosed) reasons, most of the Venators are dead and gone -- only these two remain. Tate and some of his allies, under the watchful (and not entirely corrupt) eye of the Council will train them to fulfill their destiny and restore the Venators to their rightful place. Throw in a distrustful populace, a mysterious and powerful enemy, and a couple of super-powered impetuous and idealistic youths and you've got yourself a heckuva story. Walls writes with a confidence and flair that helps the reader trust that she'll be able to make sense of a fairly jumbled beginning (not bad, but could've been easier to navigate). Once we get into Eon, she balances plot, character work and worldbuilding to create a foundation for a promising series. I wondered a couple of times if the characters could've been developed a little more fully, but the work as a whole was strong enough that I was willing to roll with it and assume she'll give us fuller characters next go around. A quick-moving introduction to an interesting new reality. Give this one a shot -- Walls will entertain you.Disclaimer: I received this book from the author in exchange for my honest thoughts -- and I'd like to thanks her for it."}, {"userName": "K.J.

There's no such thing as vampires, and werewolves are a tale spun from the imagination of authors. The supernatural does not exist. At least that is what Rune thought, hoped. Yet every time she saw something portraying this mystical nature her body instinctively responded. She wanted to act. She knew something was missing in her life, but she just didn't know what. There was another person like her, an old school friend by the name of Grey. Unlike Rune he didn't suppress his desire, his thirst for knowledge on all creatures thought myth. He poured tirelessly over books, his obsession forcing him to become an outcast. But he knew something the others didn't. The tales were true. The creatures were real. He had seen them with his own eyes. Years ago his paths had crossed with Tate, someone from another realm, a person to whom he owed his life. Their meeting was anything but accidental. Tate had been searching for someone just like him. But at the time he had been too young, and he had needed to choose wisely. The fate of his realm depended on the decision he made. The council, since separating their world from that the Venators resided in, had grown corrupt, wanting more power, more loyalty. But with the rising of a new and powerful nemesis the only way they can keep the reigns of control is to employ those their people most fear. The Venators. They must bend them to their will, display their talents as a fear stoking trophy of their supremacy. Tate could not let this be, his choice of which two Venators to return to his world could be catastrophic. He had to hope, pray, they would not fall to the councils' manipulation. The two he chose, Rune and Grey, face a hard decision, to work for the people, the innocents being victimised, or protect their own lives by conforming to the councils' desire.I will hail Davri Walls' talent with four simple words. I loved this book. These words I do not utter lightly. This tale has everything that makes an epic fantasy great. I was hooked from the first paragraph. The manner in which the tale is spun is magic itself. I loved the characters, the hardships, the pressure, both real and imagined, and their own personal journeys through the tale's progression. Brilliantly written to invoke the perfect balance between descriptive writing and imagination as a new realm, thought only fable, is brought to life, everything from the magisterially pure to the hauntingly dark. There is much to this world, and Rune and Grey must learn to understand it, and its ways, quickly. As a huge fan of fantasy works I highly recommend Venators: Through the Arch, it won't leave you wanting for anything, except for the second book in the series. This book gets my highest possible praises, it is a masterpiece, well deserving of five stars."}, {"userName": "Lauren Jones", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36536035-lauren-jones", "userReview": "He waded in, glancing back to make sure she followed.

The abuse grew more violent the closer they got to the other side. Something kicked the back of his knee so hard his leg buckled, and he was grateful he\u2019d left his arms free for balance.

He swore under his breath as he twisted away from another attack. Fantasy can be so creative! The more creative and original the author is, the better the read as well as the surprise that comes from not knowing the world in which the story takes place. Walls has an entire world that has just unfolded in this first installment. This is a world filled with everything unimaginable, but some prominent appearances are humans, vampires, werewolves, shape-shifters, incubi, dragons and something new\u2026called Venators. Throughout this read, there are inviting entities and others who work for themselves. Starting out in our world, two siblings struggle against their nature\u2026knowing that something is coming. Riley starts drinking, making his sister Rune, watch after him. There is only one person that Rune feels the most comfort when around, Grey Malteer. Grey loves everything supernatural, which Rune detests, but in order to understand herself more\u2026she feels drawn to Grey and in finding out what he knows about them. After a mysterious man by the name of Tate walks into both of their lives, nothing will ever be the same. Suddenly, everything they hold dear is in danger and goblins are chasing them through the streets. Their only escape is a portal that Tate opens. With no idea where the portal leads, Grey and Rune must make a near impossible jump into the unknown, trusting a blue man that may or may not have their best interests in mind. What they find on the other side and who they trust will either save them or be their ultimate demise. Walls has a superb story-line with fantastic character development. All of the characters in this story are unique, interesting and entertaining. They all have such depth that will intrigue the reader and allow them to feel emotions like desperation, determination and hopefulness. The pace is fast, making an easy and absolutely satisfying read. There were little to no errors, making the story that much more enjoyable for the reader.

There is nothing about this that really goes in that direction, as I happily discovered, and the world is more fae-like than your typical \"paranormal\" world. So, there are a few things that bugged me--such as how easily the Venator abilities were accessed, no training, and progression that was very, very convenient. There are quite a few players in this story, but not enough information about any of them, really. This really bothered me because all of them are interesting characters! They all have a story behind them, and you just don't know how few and far between these things are given anymore. I sure hope more things will come to light as the series continues.What I did like, and have so much respect for, was how not everything that took place in this book was easy or just fell into place. That made this all the more enjoyable to read. It made it unpredictable because you just don't see this style of writing anymore--especially in YA or NA, which is why I have mostly written them off, save for a few authors I know I can trust to at least entertain me. The realism of reality in dangerous circumstances was so much appreciated, I was practically humming with delight.I'm not a fan of Rune, but I do like that she bumbles along as she should given her nonexistent experience. Grey's an admirable character and I just know he's going to have a rough ride in this series and I am already feeling sorry for him.But anyway, I really enjoyed this book. I was very engrossed when I didn't have homework, class, or work. I'm also anticipating the next in the series! Very excited to see what else Walls will come up with as she gains momentum as an author. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to read the book. It was exactly what I needed."}, {"userName": "Angharad Lodwick", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29965163-angharad-lodwick", "userReview": "Check out my full review at https://tintededges.wordpress.com/201..."}, {"userName": "Jackie (No Bent Spines)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6732598-jackie-no-bent-spines", "userReview": "ARC via author in exchange for honest review 4.5 stars Find this review and more on No Bent SpinesFULL REIVEWFirst of all: yaaaassssss.This\u2014THIS\u2014is what I have been waiting for. Wing of Nestor, looking out. Because the queen of high fantasy is back and better than ever before. The first book in the series follows Grey and Rune as they are taken to a different world and subjected to the will of the ruling group of supernatural powers: succubus, fae, wizards, vampires, and incubus. As they find their place in this world, they have to battle internal fears as well as a powerful magical queen-like figure. (SHE HAS A DRAGON). VENATORS is the best mix of fantastical worlds, romance, and discovering how much of a force to be reckoned with you can be.Rune is amazing. I\u2019ll just begin my actual review portion of the rant with that. She\u2019s so real and scared and fierce as all get out. After being dragged into another dimension in hopes of saving her brother from supernatural forces, she herself is forced to re-evaluate her priorities. I adore how she reacts when she\u2019s confronted with things that she\u2019s not used to, and, frankly, shouldn\u2019t be possible. Her relationship with the other characters is built up in a way that is believable.It\u2019s sort of like this: you\u2019ve got to do what you have to do (in this case, save her brother from the forces of evil) and it\u2019s okay to be freaking out (vampire biting is a no-no, and screaming is a natural reaction when something is way weird) along the way. I love the take-it-as-it-comes savior folks, but I also want the ones who I can relate to. I mean, let\u2019s be honest, not everyone is going to be totally okay with dragons and blue not-humans being a real life thing.This honest (sort of) human being, her (once again, sort of) friend from her normal life, and the (sort of) allies they meet along the way. This, my darlings, is what I call an adventure. This is why I love Devri Walls. I like the world-building, and the characters who are magical, and the guys who are swoony. So much YES.And VENATORS had that.Later gators,Jackie"}, {"userName": "GrnEyed", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11838644-grneyed", "userReview": "At first look this appears to be the story of a troubled young man and a woman with whom he\u2019s had an attraction for years. Upon deeper exploration, Venators is a book about Grey, a young man who has suffered untold pain throughout his life but forges ahead under a veil of secrecy.On the other side is Rune and Ryker. Twins who have gone off to college in hopes of a fresh start. For Rune she became her brother\u2019s keeper, watching over him so nothing bad happens to him. Rune gets along with Grey but unfortunately Ryker has unexplainable issues with Grey. Unbeknownst to Rune there is a tie that binds them, which is a key reason for the problems between Ryker and Grey.After getting a drunken Ryker back to his room, the lives of the three change. Creatures coming for Grey and Rune also bring with them their salvation, Tate. In order to save them, Tate takes Grey and Rune through the Arch and they end up in an alternate world where they are surrounded by all the supernatural creatures they only read about in books or saw in movies.Grey and Rune are faced with the new reality that they are Venators, an almost completely extinct group of powerful warriors. They are called to visit council. Once there they are faced with the deep desire to save innocent lives, which goes completely against the council\u2019s wishes, or obey the council\u2019s order.Grey and Rune are put through an assortment of incredible tests. They are tested mentally, physically, and emotionally. They are put in a position where they are unsure who to trust and believe in.Venators had a tremendous amount of action. There seemed to be one twist or trial after another that Grey and Rune had to endure once they pass through the arch. Will they do as instructed? Trust their new friends? Will Rune abandon Grey to find her brother or will they battle through things together? If you love werewolves, vampires, and the unbelievable, this is a fast read that is rather enjoyable."}, {"userName": "Brooke", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18908207-brooke", "userReview": "First things first: I received an advanced reader's copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. I have read all of Devri's previous books, and have to say I've seen more growth in her as an author than in anyone else I've read. Ms. Walls clearly has a lot of talent - some of which is still developing - and each book is better than the last. She's definitely someone to keep an eye on.On to my review: The first book in the Venators series was a short but enjoyable read. The characters were appropriately complex and easy to relate to, and the storyline was enjoyable and at times difficult to put down. As usual, Devri does a great job building the characters' world in a way that is vivid without being overwhelming. There are less spelling and punctuation errors in this book than in her earlier ones, although I still saw at least one or two per chapter (she could really do with a better editor). The ending of this book felt a bit rushed - almost like she'd already written book two and, rather than develop a proper ending for the first book, simply stuck a divider into a random chapter ending and decided that was good enough. All that aside, what really matters is whether the book was enjoyable. The answer to that is a definite yes. This is a book any fantasy lover would appreciate. I don't think its appeal would stretch to those who prefer general fiction to fantasy, but for those like myself who read primarily within this genre, it's definitely worth picking up. I look forward to reading the rest of this series, as well as any other books Devri writes in the future, and encourage other fantasy readers to check them out as well."}, {"userName": "Promisary", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59479924-promisary", "userReview": "* Note : I was given a free copy for review purposes by Ms. Walls.
