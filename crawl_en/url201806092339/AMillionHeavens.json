It's kind of a slower burn than his previous books; it felt a little draggy at the beginning, but all of a sudden I was so immersed in it and it just tears through from there on. Unsurprisingly, being John Brandon, it's really super sad, but it's a bit more plangent than the previous ones, and less cruelly fucked up.Also, jeepers, look how pretty that cover is!

How dare the author write such a disjointed narrative and then tie it together so beautifully in the last few pages? John Brandon can write beautifully but I wanted a story that I could dig into without keeping a journal of 'symbolism that I should (but don't want to) think about'.I plodded through narration by a wolf, a gas station owner, a dead guy, a mayor, some guide, Arn, Dannie, Cecilia, Soren's father, and assorted others. I know the characterizations were layered to reveal a universal truth. I understood the power of \"dreaming about what they already got.\" Yet, I felt duped as a reader. I never knew enough about the characters to really care about them and their long-winded, convoluted stories. At the center is Soren, a gifted pianist who is in a coma. I'm fine with that as a catalyst to see how others behave. I just found myself perpetually annoyed by the multiple narrators. Powell's Indiespensable club chose this book for me. I'm back to picking my own books. I have this compulsion to finish (almost always) any book that I start so I need to chose very carefully."}, {"userName": "Jason Sinclair Long", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1201413-jason-sinclair-long", "userReview": "I think maybe some of the reviewers who didn't like this book either don't like this KIND of book or don't know how to read this kind of book. There are a lot of negative comments regarding the \"disjointed plot line,\" etc. Yes, like many other authors have done in the past and will continue to do in the future, Brandon switches between several inhabitants of a prescribed geographical area. And then he ties all the disparate stories together in the end. For me, in this case, it works. The writing is varied and exciting and the characters complex and moving, two things Brandon may have been proving he could manage based on critiques of his first two novels (terse prose and flat characters). Truth be told, I read A Million Heavens while burning with fever, so perhaps I was more open to the kaleidoscopic structure of the book because my defenses were down. Whatever the reasons, I liked the book and would recommend it."}, {"userName": "Wayne", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15558119-wayne", "userReview": "I really liked this novel.

(I don't know how they choose, but if anyone would like to enlighten me, I'd appreciate it.) Here in Seattle/King County we have great librarians. In the past year I've taken a chance on five books that ended up to be 4/5 star titles. All from the library, all off the shelves on a whim - lucky me. A Million Heavens makes it six.A child prodigy who taps the universal chords for all of 30 seconds falls into a coma. The six or so other characters tracked in this novel are all touched by that incident - some more directly than others, but all within the orbit. John Brandon does a terrific job of giving life to each of the characters, and a few others on the periphery. This is a book about the good we do to and for one another, even with some bad mixed in, and I think the entire work is a love hymn of sorts. It's the most optimistic read of the year for me. It also takes place between Albuquerque and Santa Fe, and I love the SW as much as I love libraries.It lost a star in its ultimate resolution, but it kept me hanging on to the very end, even if the ending confused me.

The ending is a bit perfunctory, though in some ways that's probably for the best, as it may have tried to tie things together too neatly with too much detail about the final fate of coma boy/musical prodigy/god's mouthpiece Soren. The other characters orbiting around Soren, including the wolf, are vivid and compelling.So yeah, go read it.

In my mind, I bounced back and forth between 3 and 4 stars as I read. I had 3-star \"It's good, but why should I care?\" moments and 4-star \"Daaaaang this shit is legit\" moments, and ultimately the latter won. I think. Reggie is dead. Soren is in a coma. These are not spoilers, because the back of the book will tell you as much. The book isn't so much about them as it is about everyone around them; the majority of the main characters don't even know Reggie or Soren, but they come together in unexpected, inexplicable, and fascinating ways. The style is part magical realism, part stream of consciousness, and all loveliness. We hear a little bit from Reggie, the dead guy. He's in a purgatorial rehearsal space, where unseen powers are encouraging him to write music again. His afterlife lyrics migrate to Cecilia's subconscious, and drive her a little crazy. She falls into a bizarre rebellious streak, but no, she's still a good person, guyz. Don't judge.Cecilia's uncle is Mayor Cabrera, the undersexed widower overseeing a struggling hotel and the dying town of Lofte. His sections are always endearing, and you can't help but root for him. Completely unrelated to Reggie et al., Dannie the cradle-robber is dating lil' Arn. Well, not really dating him so much as using him for his sperm. Their story is despairing, and even a little fucked up, and ultimately unresolved. Arn's back story doesn't serve a direct purpose in the narrative, but it is thought provoking. Soren's father is little more than just that: Soren's father. He remains unnamed, defined by his unconscious son, and removed from happiness and vivacity. He is complacent. People walk into his life and walk right out again, and not a single fuck is given. Most strikingly, there is a wolf. He is slowly gaining human rationality and understanding, and it is driving him to madness. Reggie's music calms him, but he finds it harder and harder to curtail his rage. The author's philosophical musings are largely communicated through this process, so I will let you discover them for yourselves in the actual book. I swear, they comprised the bulk of my 4-star-'wow'-moments-while-reading.Oh, and there's also a gas station attendant. He likes his life, but wants to wander the desert for a while. Not entirely sure what to make of him. These are the main characters, if you can even call them that. The characterization makes up the bulk of my 3-star moments. I just couldn't care about them. Sure, their thoughts and actions are visceral and interesting, and John Brandon's prose is simply DIVINE, but... eh. Okay, they're people. People + Wolf. Cool? The other main 3-star moment: the ending. It was unsurprising, cliched, and a bit saccharine. Or at least, the part that had an ending; the bulk of the story lines seem conspicuously unresolved, which I found really engaging as a reader. I may not care about these people, but what happens to them (or doesn't happen) at the end of the novel brought my rating back to 4 stars. And it shall remain as such. For now."}, {"userName": "Jennifer ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2852755-jennifer", "userReview": "Cecelia, The Wolf, The Mayor, Reggie, Dannie, Arn, The Gas Station Owner, Soren's Father, The Piano Teacher, The Wolf, Dannie, The Gas Station Owner, Arn, Cecelia, The Mayor, Reggie, Cecelia, The Wolf...these are subheadings cutting up the entire book every two or three pages. These characters all relate to each other but not in a very interesting way. Additionally, each character is referred to in third person by each name above which is tiresome and annoying when you have to keep reading \"The Gas Station Owner\" every time the author refers to him. Same goes for Soren's Father and The Mayor...don't these people have/deserve real NAMES!?!? Ugh.Additionally, each character had such a sad, stagnant life. Reggie was dead and in spirit limbo. Cecelia misses Reggie, has a shut-in mother and goes to vigils for a boy in a coma. Soren's father is waiting for him to come out of a coma. Dannie goes to the vigils for Soren, has cut everyone from her life and is trying to get pregnant with Arn. Arn doesn't know his much older girlfriend, Dannie is trying to get knocked up, compulsively lies to Dannie and grew up in abusive foster care. The gas station owner works in a gas station (duh) and wants to take a death walk into the desert. The wolf wants to torture domesticated animals for fun because he's going crazy. The Mayor misses his dead wife and worries his city is financially ruined. I don't know why I kept reading this as long as I did. Well, no, I do. Each character in this book is written separately from the others which led me to ASSUME that they would all converge and tie in together in a way that would make wonderful sense by the end, which is what encouraged me to keep reading. In the end, they sorta-kinda relate, but not in a way that I found fulfilling. I should've quit while I was ahead. There were a few great lines within these pages, but, most of it was uninteresting filler told from the point of third person...which, as we all know, is a boring as hell way to tell a story. I could kinda understand where the author was trying to go with each character, but by the end it just wasn't worth it."}, {"userName": "Tarin Towers", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12201535-tarin-towers", "userReview": "\"A Million Heavens\" follows about a dozen characters as they live their messy lives in and around shitty small towns in New Mexico. Events center around a young boy who currently lies in a coma, having collapsed after playing beautiful, original music out of nowhere. His piano teacher feels guilty. His father is a wreck, refusing to leave the hospital. Legions of residents of the area hold weekly vigils, with mixed motives. One of these, a young community college student named Cecilia, has also lost a dear friend with musical gifts, and we see her story unfold as she pursues self-destruction, not purely out of rebellion but out of a total loss as to what to do with herself and her housebound mother. A touch of the supernatural inhabits this novel, not just in the form of the spooky gifts of the somnolent child, but in the form of Cecilia's dead bandmate, who occupies some sort of limbo in the afterlife where he's alternately cajoled and blackmailed into writing new songs from beyond the grave. Another character we follow is a wolf, named Wolf, who tracks the comings and goings of the main character, as haunted by music as the rest of them. I am a huge fan of \"Arkansas,\" Brandon's first novel. While this one didn't have me crowing about its genius like \"Arkansas\" did, I still greatly enjoyed it. Note: Plan on doing a lot of flipping back and forth in the book until you remember who all the characters are, because there are about a dozen, and it takes a while to figure out which ones you have to pay attention to. Keep going, though, even if it feels like work at first. Once you get going, it's a joy to track the progress of everyone from the gas station owner to the mayor/uncle/hotel proprietor."}, {"userName": "Sean Owen", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7178587-sean-owen", "userReview": "John Brandon has done an impressive job of carving out a recognizable style with only a few books to his credit. The Brandon style has a very strong sense of place, though \"A Million Heavens\" is based in the New Mexico desert rather than the sprawl of northern Florida that was the home for \"Citrus County\" and several of his short stories. Brandon's books have a multitude of perspectives rather than a single leading voice. These characters are nearly all united by a sense of dissatisfaction or yearning. The strength of \"A Million Heavens\" is largely derived from Brandon's characters. He manages to create characters across ages and social strata that are all wholly believable. Part of what allows him to accomplish this is his strength with dialogue. While tragedy is behind the unhappiness of these characters Brandon is wise to avoid the sentimentality and focus instead on the low grade day to day manifestations of unhappiness. These characters are more troubled by lives that have gotten off track for reasons that are somewhat unclear than they are by the bigger tragedies.\"A Million Heavens\" is a bold leap for a young writer who previously wrote about characters near his own age and from his home turf. Brandon's willingness to experiment and take risks is what gets him into trouble here. One of the characters is a wolf and the wolf chapters work for a time as a sort of distant narrator, but when the chapters begin talking about the wolf's angst the conceit falls apart. Another of the characters is in a sort of heaven/purgatory and Brandon is unable to make this come off the way he seems to have intended. I'm willing to forgive him these missteps, because on the whole the book still suceeds."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11809312-david", "userReview": "Although I puzzled through much of this book wondering where it was going and how it would tie its various and seemingly unrelated story lines together, I ended up loving where it went and ultimately loving the book itself.John Brandon is a good solid writer and certainly not someone unfamiliar with the oddities of the human condition; Citrus County proved that.

I\u2019m a terrible impulse-buyer when it comes to the Kindle.)(Also, can we just marvel over this cover? Gorgeous. McSweeney\u2019s really excels at cover art.)I was so looking forward to A Million Heavens, and after a few initial disappointing chapters, I thought, \u201cit will get better. It just has to hit its stride.\u201dUnfortunately, it never really did.Set in New Mexico, it follows, in small, somewhat strange chapters, the events that happen to various townsfolk over a bleak winter. A young prodigy lies in a coma while his father sits by his bedside, helpless. People sit outside in vigil, for various reasons. A woman on the run from her life attempts a new start with a man with a checkered past. A lost young musician mourns the death of the man she loved, which is proving to also be the death of her muse. The mayor of the town tries to find himself through his love for a woman who is possibly off-limits. And a wolf travels through the town, trying in vain to retain his wildness in a town that\u2019s becoming increasingly industrialized and filled with the mystery of humans.The problem I had was that I cared about very few of the stories/characters. I found myself waiting, somewhat impatiently, for the chapters involving Cecelia, the musician, and her departed love, Reggie (who actually gets a voice and a storyline from the beyond.) They were the two characters who seemed the most fleshed-out, whose fates and outcomes I actually cared about. The rest of them, although not poorly written (Brandon couldn\u2019t write clunky prose if he tried; the man writes beautifully) were\u2026somewhat cardboard. Uninteresting. I was not invested in their stories, in their fates. I was reading to see what happened to Cecelia; if she would redeem herself, if she would find what she was looking for under the New Mexico stars, in the damage she found herself drawn to cause. I was reading to see if Reggie would be able to finally communicate his love for her from beyond, because he\u2019d missed his chance when he was on earth.I\u2019m not flat-out panning the book. Brandon\u2019s prose is leaps and bounds better than most people\u2019s I read, and I will continue to read his work, and eagerly await what he publishes next. But after the wonder and mystery and magic of Citrus County, I found myself disappointed by this one. I know he\u2019s capable of more and of better. I appreciate that he was trying something different and outside the box, and I like that he\u2019s attempting to evolve; I just don\u2019t think this book worked on all levels.(Originally published at Insatiable Booksluts)"}, {"userName": "Laura (booksnob)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/769412-laura-booksnob", "userReview": "New Mexico.

He employs a P.T. Anderson approach, showing us multiple, slightly interconnected stories at the same time, as a group of people in a failing town in New Mexico try to get by. A young boy is stuck in a mysterious coma, but it's his father who is unable to move forward. A young woman is mourning the loss of the guy she was in love with, who also fronted the band she played in. A woman in her thirties has recently moved to the town looking to get pregnant, and her boyfriend, who is younger than her, is almost unable to display emotion. The town's Mayor, still still missing his dead wife, presides over the town's slow decline. The owner of the local gas station feels drawn to the desert.These various stories bump into each other in places, and much of this book works as a realistic examination of life in 21st century America, but at the same time, Brandon introduces some magical realist elements as well. The young boy, Soren, is likely a musical genius, having only played the piano once. The dead musician is a character in the book; he's found himself trapped in a strange form of purgatory that wants him to compose new music. A lone wolf becomes entranced by the music the young woman plays, and decides to live in the town, taking out his frustrations on peoples' pets.Brandon's writing is often quite lovely, and his insights into his characters are always interesting. There is a bit of a maudlin tone to this novel though, and I found that the more I read, the more it began to wear me down, even as the characters began to lift themselves out of their personal funks.

I did not receive any other compensation for this review."}, {"userName": "Alexandra Rosenblum", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5477336-alexandra-rosenblum", "userReview": "120 pages in and finally something even slightly interesting happened. Thank goodness.SPOILERS****************************************I read this book because it was sent to me as an Indiespensible and it is as of yet the ONLY Indiespensible that has not been a page-turner for me. I basically had to force myself through it. I hate that.It had a lot of characters and alternated between their first person voices, which isn't necessarily a problem in itself I don't think, but I don't know if there were just too many of what but this story took a LONG time to get rolling. In the Indiespensibles interview with Powells Johns Brandon mentions something about this- he says that readers would be relieved that something had finally happened because when you have so many characters it takes a long time to set them up. But I really think it might have been too little too late. (I wrote the above note before reading the interview). I think this may not have been Brandon's fault- this may be an editing failure. He needed to be reined in maybe? I did like that somehow the stories ended up sort-of happy but not too forced or heavy handed either. That is hard to do. It didn't all tie together too nicely with a bow- I was happy about that. And I'm glad Reggie didn't come back from the dead. phew. Also, none of the characters are perfect. not everything ends nicely. thats good.So all in all I think the Brandon avoided some huge pitfalls but could have benefited from stronger editing. I just talked myself into 3 stars instead of 2. hm."}, {"userName": "Jonathan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2765549-jonathan", "userReview": "If John Brandon writes like anyone, he writes like Kurt Vonnegut. The content is completely different, of course, but the structure of the sentence is remarkably similar. Short, simple sentences, often beginning with the name of a character, full of matter-of-fact detail, and frequent little bursts of philosophy.My first book by Brandon was Citrus County, and while that one was a page-turner, this one has very low tension. If it were a movie, it would be one of those indie flicks with lingering camera shots of squinty-eyed actors sitting in a small town gazing meaningfully out a window or doing something poetic by themselves. This book has lots of little spurts of plot growing all over the place but in the end it is (to me) an atmospheric work. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Brandon has gotten more adept at deftly telling a lot of stories at once. There are many characters here and he cuts back and forth between them a lot. That and the easy-reading descriptions make reading this book about as easy as watching television, except in this case you have the vague sense that someone wiser than you is trying to get something across about people, and about hope, and about waiting. No morals or philosophizing here, just a few hundred pages of meditation. I think Brandon could do all this and write a page-turner, too (because he did, in fact, do all this and write a page-turner too) so I'm only giving this three stars. But it's not because I'm not a fan of Mr. Brandon's. I'm down to one unread book by him, and I'm going to savor it."}, {"userName": "Pete", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/676532-pete", "userReview": "i should just start including a boilerplate legal notice that 5 quality units is not a sufficiently nuanced gradient for rendering opinions BUT whatever. i give this book 4.5 stars and round it up to 5 because i personally really like john brandon's thing. gentle but not bland language, an insistent rhythm, characters who are flawed in serious but forgivable ways. this isn't dark or light or literary or commercial (well it is probably a little literary in the sense of not really having big dumb plot) but it just kind of rolls right over you like a sensible japanese-built sedan. because the forms and figures are often unremarkable or extremely subtle it can be easy to assume the entire read is unremarkable but it isn't, at all. again i am totally writing as a fan and not a critic but i dig john brandon. this book felt longer than its 268 pages but didn't drag; in part because i was trying to simultaneously savor the writing and also wolf it all down as fast as i could and feel the shape of the book inside my gut. I think part of my thing with Brandon is that this is how I want to write, a kind of nearly-blank but soulful mythical sound.the minus .5 i would give is for a slightly pat ending, but it was the kind of pat ending the world could use more of. RIP reggie and the chickens and the rabbit and the buzzards and the other dead pets. I would scribble down all the individual lines that i underlined in my copy but it would take an hour, maybe some other time."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54041-michelle", "userReview": "Oooh, I liked this! And I have no solid reason why. The writing is beautiful. The stories are thought-provoking, or they could be, but I didn't dig too deeply usually. I just enjoyed each person's story, enjoyed the writing, kept humming along, not really caring how we ended. I didn't bother to make connections between the characters, didn't look for some big, ultimate lesson. There were a few moments where I felt like, Oooh, John Brandon, you are a wise person and you said that so perfectly, but it was usually when he was very, very clear on what I was supposed to be getting:\"'Let me ask you something,' Mayor Cabrera said. \"Someone asked me this question and I need an answer: Where do we all go wrong?'The boy looked out at his friends. He repeated the question under his breath, turning a dial on his watch. 'Thinking that because you want something and it's a reasonable thing to want and you make proper preparations and you deserve the thing, that you're going to get it.'Mayor Cabrera push aside his can of nuts and rested his elbows on his desk. 'That's pretty good,' he said. 'That's not bad.'\"Heck yeah, that's not bad, Mayor Cabrera and John Brandon and boy with tons of wisdom. I feel like that's where I always go wrong."}, {"userName": "Courtney Carlson", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7690074-courtney-carlson", "userReview": "Brandon's ensemble novel is narrated by characters - from a wolf to a dead man to a salty teenager - that are more or less convincingly rendered. The book, which I think wants to be simultaneously pensive and playful and grounded, is set in the maybe-dying desert communities surrounding Albuquerque. There are gorgeous scenes, some well-developed characters, scraps of compelling dialogue (the structural polyphony most of the time serves as a kind of conversation in lieu of actual speech between characters), and a few keen, smart lines. But in this work of magical realism, Brandon's also always barely sidestepping the cloying. I think that movement - between a work that's refreshingly young and not at all ostentatious, and one that wants to deal in a sophisticated way with \"big\" human experiences like love and grief and loneliness - mostly works, but sometimes Brandon loses control. (As he does, in my view, at the end, which one could detect about halfway through the book, and which felt disappointingly tidy and at least a bit mawkish.)Overall, though, I kept looking forward to picking this book up each. A few characters in particular became really dear to me. And it offered a nice, unfussy tonal alternative to the kinds of books I more often read."}], "description": "On the top floor of a small hospital, an unlikely piano prodigy lies in a coma, attended to by his gruff, helpless father.
