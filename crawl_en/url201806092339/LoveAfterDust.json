It has a very interesting concept and I loved the idea behind \"Dust\". The scenes are well written and I especially thought the love scenes were well done. This book also has a very interesting flow, making you think about whats happening and debating internally what is real or dream. I highly recommend."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40342532-heather", "userReview": "I just absolutely loved this book from beginning to end! The story was fascinating and the characters (mostly Ryan, but also Julia) were incredibly interesting and well developed. I started reading, and I just couldn't stop myself. The post-apocalyptic stories are also so interesting to me, and this one goes even farther by telling the story from the viewpoint of Ryan awake, as well as sleeping. I definitely recommend this to those people looking for a great new read!"}, {"userName": "Edma", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23065891-edma", "userReview": "* I won this book in a first-reads goodreads giveaway contest.I think that overall, it was a good book, with a nice plot and interaction going on, and I really liked how the author had captured the emotional and psychological side of the events occurring. But, I think that as an author James has to work a bit more, even though in my opinion this book was overall good."}, {"userName": "Amanda Gilliatt", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15917589-amanda-gilliatt", "userReview": "Awww loved this book,so gutted its ended,brill story line,glad ryan found her.but love the way it went from his life and then into his dream."}, {"userName": "Jay G", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30890847-jay-g", "userReview": "Want to see more bookish things from me? Check out my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfer...*I received this book from goodreads for an honest review*. This book follows 22 year old Ryan who believes he may be one of the last people on Earth. The human race has been wiped out by a disease they call \"dust\" which sucks all the moisture out of your body until you turn into nothing but dust. Ryan has been visited by a 19 year old girl named Julia in his dreams for weeks now, and he's beginning to not know the difference between reality and this dream world. I didn't really enjoy this book. I found it to be rather repetitive I think the overall idea of the story could have been amazing if there had been a bit more action and excitement."}, {"userName": "Taylor Smith", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34486810-taylor-smith", "userReview": "The book is so well-written and really explores the types of emotions that we have as human beings. I could feel Ryan's pain and how lonely he felt when he was all alone. When he found Jessica, I could sense the change in him and he became a better man. I loved how they fought through everything together and became stronger as a couple. This book is so inspirational and I couldn't put it down. I would have to say it is one of the best I have read."}, {"userName": "C.

At first it had me really hooked, but then I lost interest.Maybe if it was longer I could've connected better to the love story, but I felt like I really didn't get to know Julia.I think the story was less about love and more about Dust and humanity in general."}, {"userName": "Cindy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21313570-cindy", "userReview": "*received for free through Goodreads First Reads I enjoyed the premise and thought the characters were well-developed.
