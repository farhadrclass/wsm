It was repetitive and boring. Let me sum up the whole book for you:Reed: I don't give a shit if I die of radiation poisoning. I just look at the stars and everything is fine. By the way, I'm desperately in love with you, Julia, but I keep fucking everything up.Julia: I love you, but I can't handle the fact that you glow green and won't quit your dumbass job.Reed: My job is fine. No one in the government would lie and let workers die slowly and painfully. Julia: Well, I was stupid enough to get pregnant, so I guess I'm stuck with your pathetic ass.

The characters well-developed, but not that interesting. Bits of science (from radiation to string theory to molecular biology) played roles both within the plot and metaphorically, but the \"romance\" just didn't interest me."}, {"userName": "Rosina Lippi", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3139413-rosina-lippi", "userReview": "Atomic Romance is a good novel. A really good novel, in many ways. Engaging and beautifully written and observed. But it's also missing something important.This is the story of Reed Futrell, a guy in his forties, divorced, with two grown children. He's got a mother who made a lifetime out of independent quirkiness; he's got an on-again-off-again girlfriend with whom he shares a consuming interest in quantum mechanics and the Hubble telescope; he has worked for twenty years as an engineer making repairs at a uranium enrichment plant.As is always the case, this story moves along on the power of conflict. Big conflicts, both present and past, small and large. Reed's mother is sick and approaching the end of her life; he's in love with Julia but they are always at odds about his job; and there's the nuclear power plant that killed his father in a chemical accident, and is now constantly in the news because old sins are rising to the surface. Beyond the expected contaminated soil and slag heaps, it seems as though the company Reed chose to trust may not have deserved his loyalty. Through the papers the workers learn about beryllium and plutonium exposure. In a small Kentucky town dependent on the plant at the center of its economy, this news is more than unsettling.Here's the thing. Reed is a very engaging character. He's likeable and interesting. As the novel opens, he's lethargic. Alternately fascinated by science, and unwilling to really think about what's wrong at the plant, and what repercussions he might personally be facing. Julia is outraged and worried, and he skates along trying to pretend everything is all right.Mason obviously knows a huge amount about these power plants and how they work. I like novels that look closely at the relationship between a mind and the tasks it takes on, and this novel does that in a very closely observed way:\"Powerful electric motors sent the gas spinning and shooting through hundreds of axial-flow compressors and into converters, where barriers with tiny holes filtered out the heavier isotopes. . . . This was the system, his friend and his enemy.\"The problem is that in spite of the richness of characterization and the conflicts which are set up so carefully, the novel meanders. A lot of it simply takes place in Reed's head, and key scenes between characters are summarized or left out. I like Reed and his thoughts, but I needed more movement. Even when the parallel crises come to a head (what's going on at the plant, and his relationship with Julia) there's little energy here. There's so little energy that the resolution sputters unconvincingly, and in fact it felt as if Mason were looking for a neat way to tie up loose ends. Which is unusual for her, and a disappointment as far as this novel is concerned."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49139162-john", "userReview": "In this novel Bobbie Ann Mason combines romance with space-time theories, mid-life crisis, nuclear contamination, family crisis, Hubble telescope photographs, life-long friendship, internet match-making, string theory, Clarence the dog and a bit of stream-of-consciousness thinking.Ms. Mason's writing is saucey, witty, erudite and lively. She wrote the story from inside the mind of Reed Futrell, protagonist extraordinare. Reed is in the midst of a mid-life crisis where has to care for his aging sick mom, has an ex-wife and two grown children, scientific interests and a grirlfriend, Julia. By way of first person narrative, the reader experiences what Reed is thinking, but doesn't always say or do what he is thinking. His thoughts are somtimes systematic, often scatter-brained, usually sarcastic but always surrounds Julia. He is most real with Clarence his dog, Burl his best friend and Julia. But she senses he's holding something back. I sometimes found it hard to believe Ms. Mason got it so right with Reed, but she did. What's wild is I understood Reed's thinking and how he processed it. At times it was a little difficult to comprehend. It comes down to how we can think many things, but don't s always say them or act on them. Good thing!Often Reed and Julia banter like academiacs. Julia continually worries about the danger Reed faces at his job at a uranium-enriching plant. They are intriguing as they discuss things like Stephen Hawkins space-time thories. They are both witty, intellectual and mutually sexually attracted to each other.I was entertained, amused and intrigued by Ms. Mason's writing. Her narration is full of wit, colloquialisms and staight talk. She provides back-story - Reeds unsatisfied yearning to learn about his father's death. Her descriptions are novel, lively and often amazing; such as the view of his mom's hospital roommate, a \"bundle of bones topped with a red wig\".I sensed Reed was going to have to make some huge decisions. A lot will deal with Julia. I'm not giving any more.If you haven't read anything by Boobie Ann Mason yet, I suggest you consider doing so."}, {"userName": "jimtown", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39521397-jimtown", "userReview": "I was eager to read this more recent book by Bobbie Ann Mason because her In Country was a book I truly enjoyed and could relate to. It's one of my rare five star books. I was interested to see where she was at after a long absence from writing.If you watch and enjoy The Big Bang Theory on TV, then you might also enjoy An Atomic Romance. I think the 2005 book predates the show. I've only recently started watching Big Bang and it has opened my eyes and made Mason's book make much more sense to me than it may have if I'd read it prior to seeing The Big Bang Theory. This book opens a new door for me in looking into String Theory. I heard about Shroedinger's cat again and though my theory differs, it's all brave, new subject matter that I may look further into.In the story, Reed Futrell is at a crossroads in his life. His easy going ways have gotten him by working at the local atomic plant. It's a place that took his dad but in some small town way, the people there feel a loyalty and almost patriotic towards the plant and the dangerous jobs they do there. Reed's girlfriend Julia is frustrated by his shrug it off attitude toward the dangers involved.This is a real easy going story and Reed is a very likable character. I'm not going to say much more about the story but I'll leave you with a quote I picked out.'Their experiment was such a tight secret that the citizens of the city didn't have a chance to imagine an uncontrolled chain reaction, a disaster that would have made the great Chicago fire seem like a wienie roast.'This was of particular significance to me, because I grew up not far from the town of Weston, that disappeared to make room for Fermi Lab, the home of Enrico(?) Fermi's atom smasher.An Atomic Romance is part romance and part atomic, but it's not a super technical book, so do be afraid to try it. Interesting, informative and the ending surprised me and made me happy. What more can I ask for?"}, {"userName": "Dale", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2523412-dale", "userReview": "The Vise of Life is closing its jaws in on Reed Futrell. His mother is failing and will likely need to go to a nursing home, there are questions about the nuclear fuel processing plant where Reed works as a maintenance engineer, and his girlfriend Julia appears to be drifting apart from him, in part because of her concern over the risks he is exposed to at the plant and in part because she is developing a hankering to study molecular biology. Reed's tasks are to hold off the Vise of Life until he can figure out some things: what happened to his dad when he worked at the plant? How much waste is really at the plant and how much radiation has he really been exposed to when repairing valves and pipes carrying UH6 to keep the cascade going? What should he do to help his mother? And above all, can he capture Julia's heart?There is a lot of physics in this book. Isotopes, uranium hexaflouride , transuranics, string theory, quarks, half-lives, astronomy, nuclear plant operations; this list is long indeed. In part it is there to describe Reed's job, and in part there as a means of metaphor. It works better on the first level than on the second. While I got a pretty good idea of what it like to scramble around the innards of processing plant in a hazmat suit, the idea of Julia pulling him closer (if indeed that is what she is doing) by encouraging him to study string theory is a bit of a stretch (more rubber band than string) to say the least.The book jumped around a bit and I though that Reed's dad's accident might have taken on greater significance. In the end, though, there is enough of a bond between Reed and those he holds close to keep things together, no strings attached."}, {"userName": "Thom (T.E.)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3502413-thom-t-e", "userReview": "To start: a wonderful choice of setting, situation, and subject matter. The industrial plants and associated towns of the Tennessee Valley that, around mid-century, went from being mining-centered to nuclear. How some people (and families) get in front of the situation when something new moves in--and they succeed some but they are also taken advantage of by those who are at the top of the company ladder and don't have their hearts into keeping the community healthy and prosperous.The leads are very well drawn and their situations sufficiently distinct to keep me involved. But then the denouement came along and I was thoroughly disappointed. It almost seemed as if the author chose the tone she wanted to have at the end and picked the best place to jump to it and that was that: a wrap for the book. Mason's work is not to be taken lightly, but I found this to be a novel where the promise was compromised."}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27923343-melanie", "userReview": "I listened to the audio of this book. I live in Oak Ridge, TN, which used to be called the atomic city so I could identify with much the author says in this book, although I think her book is probably based on the DOE plant in Padukah, KY, not Oak Ridge, but it could be any nuclear plant city. If I didn't live here and have some knowledge of people who have become ill because of the chemicals that are found in the plants and those that have been improperly disposed of in the past, I might not have enjoyed the book as much as I did.

The characters were flawed in realistic ways and their interactions and conversations seemed natural. The story is about the personal journey of one man through an awakening to the world beyond himself and love.

In An Atomic Romance we meet Reed Futrell, a sexy, thoughtful hero who grapples with radioactive contamination, a midlife crisis, and string theory\u2013all while falling in love. Reed is an engineer at a uranium-enrichment plant near a riverside city in heartland America. He has deep roots in this community: He was raised there; his father worked at the very same plant before him. And it was here that Reed met, married, and then divorced his wife. Reed spends countless nights camping at a local wildlife preserve, gazing at the stars, fishing and hunting\u2013that is, until deformed frogs are discovered at the site. Though his father was killed in a tragic accident at the atomic plant years ago, Reed stays on, proud to perform demanding and dangerous work for the benefit of the nation. As for the radioactive \u201cincidents\u201d he has endured, Reed prefers to think about other things\u2013Hubble photographs of distant galaxies, Albert Einstein, his dog.Reed\u2019s casual attitude toward danger infuriates his on-again-off-again girlfriend, Julia, as much as his quirky mind and muscular body intrigue her. Julia, a biologist, is truly Reed\u2019s match\u2013or maybe more than his match. They both are witty, curious, and fascinated by science. Indeed, their courtship began with banter about Stephen Hawking\u2019s theories of space-time, and ever since it has been an up-and-down adventure of sexual attraction, intellectual game-playing, and long silences when Julia refuses to return Reed\u2019s calls. When news reports reveal evidence of radioactive pollution in the land surrounding the plant, Reed and Julia\u2019s relationship faces an unprecedented challenge. In An Atomic Romance, Bobbie Ann Mason delivers a brilliant novel set against a backdrop of atomic power: a love story between a motorcycle-riding loner and an independent, strong-minded biologist; between the peaceful present in a typical American community and the nation\u2019s violent nuclear past; and, finally, between a good man and the work he takes pride in, though it may be putting his life in danger.", "title": "An Atomic Romance", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/81649.An_Atomic_Romance", "average": 2.99, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1171002263l/81649.jpg", "reviews": 26, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/43848.Bobbie_Ann_Mason", "name": "Bobbie Ann Mason"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Romance", "Contemporary", "Literary Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/81649.An_Atomic_Romance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1329929.An_Atomic_Romance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/532754.Atomic_Romance_UNABRIDGED_", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10178343-the-girl-in-the-blue-beret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/81648.In_Country", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/98803.Shiloh_and_Other_Stories", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/278775.Feather_Crowns", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77334.Clear_Springs"]}
