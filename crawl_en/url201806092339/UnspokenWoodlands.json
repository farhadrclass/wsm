Slut. Typhoid Mary. I've been called all these at Central College. One drunken night, one act of irresponsible behavior, and my reputation was ruined. Guys labeled me as easy and girls shied away. To cope, I stayed away from Central social life and away from Central men, so why is it that my new biology lab partner is so irresistible to me?He's everything I shouldn't want. A former Marine involved in illegal fighting with a quick trigger temper and an easy smile for all the women. His fists aren't the danger to me, though, it's his charm. He's sliding his way into my heart and I'm afraid that he's going to be the one to break me.Impulsive. Unthinking. Hot tempered. I allow instinct to rule my behavior. If it feels good, do it, has been my motto because if I spend too much time thinking, I'll begin to remember exactly where I came from. At Central College, I've got fighting and I've got women and I thought I was satisfied until I met her. She's everything I didn't realize I wanted and the more time I spend with her, the more I want her. But she's been hurt too much in the past and I don't want to be the one to break her.

After losing her virginity to a Lacrosse player at the beginning of her freshmen year of college and then turning down another \u201coffer\u201d to hook up with another player, the team takes it upon themselves to make AM\u2019s life a living hell. Almost overnight AM goes from a normal college student to the girl who\u2019ll pretty much do anything with anyone. She\u2019s whispered about in class, openly called a slut and an assumed carrier of everything VD related. Is it any wonder she's started to fold into herself and stick close to her friends and her life off campus? Bo Randolph is an ex-marine, underground fighter and hot as hell. He has his own demons to deal with but for the most part he\u2019s a down to earth, loving life kind of guy who doesn\u2019t do relationships. I know what you\u2019re thinking, an NA manwhore not open to the possibility of a serious girlfriend. Color me surprised! Bo\u2019s lacking the brooding moodiness of the other hot boys so often found in this genre and this is a good thing in this case. He\u2019s dealing with his own set of issues; he just isn\u2019t advertising them by being a jack ass. For a good portion of the book, Bo\u2019s wit and sarcasm balanced out an equally sarcastic but weary AM. This started off as a lab partners to friends to lovers story and I enjoyed the pace of the relationship and the fact the story was told from alternating POVs. Either of these two experiencing an insta-love would\u2019ve been completely unbelievable.\nI\u2019m a bad bet, Sunshine, but if you\u2019re willing to give me a whirl around the ring, I\u2019m yours.

I really enjoyed this book, and do you want to know why? Because of Bo, I freaking loved Bo. I've decided to claim him for myself. Its actually funny because I started out not sure I'd even like him and by the end of the book I was completely in love with him. Let me give you some reasons to love Bo too,\"She really it for you?\" \"You know how it's all about God and country over there in Afghaniston.\" Gray nodded. \"Well, when you find someone like AM, what you felt about the cause, about being a patriot, is like eating eggs from the MRE pack.

He yells encouragement when the drill sergeant's shouting obscenities. You know that if you're ever caught by the enemy, your brothers will never stop looking for you.

He is someone I would want at my back, supporting me.AM had her moments for me. I would really like her and then she'd annoy me. I felt like the whole time she was pushing Bo away because she'd heard about all the man-whoring he had done, made her sound like a hypocrite. She was believing all the rumors about him, when she herself had false rumors spead about her. For the most part I liked her though. I thought she was pretty strong, and I loved her speech near the end of the book. I don't think I could have delt with rumors like that as well as she did.I would also like to say that I really love to cover for this one!

My favorite type of series is the companions, with each story focusing on a different member of a group of friends or family. In this series, we get the guys of the Woodlands. The first book, Undeclared, was Noah Jackson's book. Unspoken is his best friend Bo Randolph's story.If you've read Undeclared, then you've met Bo Randolph. And if you've met Bo Randolph, then you know why I wanted to read this as soon as possible. Bo is a blond-haired, sexy, charming former Marine. He's a good time guy who's always up for a fight or a f--- (you know what I'm saying). But the thing is, Bo is a good guy. A good friend. Best of all, he's more than good to the girl he cares about.Not only does Unspoken have a worthy guy, but also a heroine who does my heart good. AnnMarie, AM, is a girl that I, like way too many women I'm afraid, could identify with. She's a girl who has been labeled, mistreated, harassed for one event during her first semester in college. She's become withdrawn from university society in an effort to protect herself, the campus ghost. Some might say AM's reaction to the bullying is weak, but I say she's not. That however she handles her feelings and fears is okay and part of a process. Unspoken is not only a love story, or Bo's story, but also AM's journey past the people who've persecuted her, and reclaiming her life and voice.I absolutely loved AM and Bo together. I like how they started out as friends and had a natural chemistry that was both fun, antagonistic, teasing, and suggestive. I love that their relationship didn't revolve around the physical, though they definitely did have that going for them. It was a layered and beautiful relationship that did revolve around trust and friendship and becoming stronger together. A team.Undeclared deals with several heavy issues: bullying, society's unbalanced treatment between the genders in regards to sexuality, physical and emotional abuse and how it affects a victim's decisions throughout their lives. It also deals with trust and the safety you can find in someone that loves you in your entirety.Author Jen Frederick has really hit on something special with the Woodlands series. Her stories are fun, funny, steamy, and thoughtful. Each story delivers enough of the other Woodlands guys to have you itching for more. And now, Frederick and this series have a permanent spot on my \"Highly-Anticipated\" list."}, {"userName": "Mare SLiTsReaD Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7854185-mare-slitsread-reviews", "userReview": "This review has been posted on:http://slitsread.wordpress.com/2013/0...www.facebook.com/slitsreadARC provided by Net Galley for an honest review4.5 Bo-Lickin StarsTo be honest I was soo freaking excited to read this book!

Too many bad memories. Many rumors. Yet, his reputation is not ruined. These are the lives of AnnMarie \"AM\" West and Beauregard \"Bo\" Randolph. AM is in to her second year of college wearing a scarlet letter and forced to self imposed-exile. Bo is in to his junior year, gliding through school, with a big reputation chasing after him that seems to call to both the women and men in different ways. These two will end up in the same class for the second time and Bo will finally get his chance to learn what AM is all about. And this time he's not about to let her get away from him.When Bo first meets AM, his intent with her is not pure. As he learns more about her his thoughts and feelings toward her change. He becomes a protector and friend. He even starts to feel things for her he has never allowed himself to feel for anyone else. AM is leery of Bo. He's a hunk of a man. She wants him. But she's scared and finds herself holding back. She becomes his lab partner and these two strike up an interesting friendship that has sexual tension so thick you can slice it with a knife. AnnMarie and Bo don't exactly have the best role models for parents either. Bo and AnnMarie have ways of coping with the strain of a relationship, or non-relationship, they have with their own set of parents. Bo will do whatever it takes to NOT be like his father while AnnMarie seems to keep her head down and keep to herself.

Happily, Grace and Noah do make an appearance, the dual narrative this time is Bo (Noah\u2019s best friend) and AnneMarie (she\u2019s referred to throughout the story as AM which did drive me crazy).I was a little concerned before I started reading Unspoken as I hadn\u2019t really warmed to Bo during Undeclared due to his attitude to Grace. I have to be honest and say although I did warm to him through this story I still do not like his attitude toward Grace or even understand it for that matter. Revelations regarding Bo\u2019s family life and adolescents give an understanding to his behaviour and the decisions he has made. Bo is a really complex character and it was fascinating to see how events, nature and nurture had shaped him into the person he is.AnneMarie (I am refusing to type AM) is such a lovely person but she has been a victim of a horrendous smear campaign. She has endured verbal and physical bullying making her afraid to venture out apart from her classes. Bo sees past the gossip to the real AnneMarie. Allowing AnneMarie to reveal the truth behind the smear campaign.The chemistry between Bo and AnneMarie is combustible The friendship and relationship building enhances the connection to the characters.Unspoken deals with some very serious issues alongside the character development and relationships.

Little did she know she was saving me from that dreaded book funk we all get into now and again. I was in the middle of browsing Amazon and my kindle for my next great read when Unspoken was brought to my attention and soon became the quick fix I needed for my romance junkie heart. AnnMarie West, or AM, has been labeled a slut, a whore, and ruthlessly nicknamed Typhoid Mary; all because she lost her virginity one drunken night to a Lacrosse player and refused another player\u2019s advances at the beginning of her freshmen year. Being ostracized and having vicious rumors spread about her has been hell. She\u2019s had no choice but to exile herself while she\u2019s in school. She never goes to anywhere on campus besides class or does anything campus related. And she certainly does not date anyone that goes to Central College. Which is why she feels all kinds of confusion and aggravation when AM is faced with another challenge\u2026 her biology partner Bo. With his adorable dimples, sexy physique, and witty remarks, he charms his way into her life and slowly starts to break down the invisible force field she\u2019s put up to protect herself. She was so screwed. AM soon learns that resisting Bo is impossible. His overpowering, irresistible sexy and charismatic appeal is a force to reckon with. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think someone gets a crush on Bo Randolph and comes away unscathed.\u201d \u2013 AM\nTwo smoldering hot words: Bo Randolph. You must meet him. Bo is a former Marine who is impulsive, bad-tempered, unpredictable, and fights illegally in underground fighting matches. He has a bad reputation for being a man-whore. But underneath the layers that make up Bo, he\u2019s protective, smart, kind, and vulnerable. Growing up, his father abused his mother and mentally messed with Bo\u2019s head to the point that he did some regrettable things to get his father\u2019s approval. Bo\u2019s way to cope with the anger, guilt, and shame is to beat the crap out of his opponent in underground fighting matches. Bo\u2019s attraction to AM started the year before when they had another class together. But she always shied away from him, and pretty much anyone, but her best girlfriend. Being her lab partner gives him the opportunity to get closer to her; to get to know the mysterious, quiet, beautiful girl. Once he gets to know her smart, witty, and independent side, he realizes she is everything he didn\u2019t even know he wanted. This is the one and only girl capable of bringing him to his knees with want.Bo and AM really complimented each other. They are charming together. They understand each other. They made each other better. They accept each other with all their many flaws and quirks. AM may be the girl with the bad reputation, but Bo didn\u2019t see her that way. Bo really saw AM for who she is beyond the vicious rumors. Bo is the one who has the bad reputation and should be talked about. But women are the ones usually stamped a slut and the men are high fived for getting laid. It\u2019s cruel and unfair and unfortunately happens often. So, I was definitely cheering when AM finally took back her dignity and confidence in one courageous move. Bo has his own issues to work through and, with AM, he\u2019s able to find the strength to confront the past that hurt him so badly. With AM\u2019s love and understanding, he\u2019s able to be a better man. \n\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve had my share of hookups. All the girls I\u2019ve been with have wanted the same thing that I was looking for \u2013 a temporary hit off the endorphin bong. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s not going to be enough for me anymore. Not since I\u2019ve met you.\u201d \u2013 Bo\n You know me well, if you know how much I love a slow burning romance that builds on friendship. The chemistry between them is full of heart and passion and meltingly hot. Bo and AM become friends first and then lovers. Neither was ready for each other, so they took their time. The passion and desire that built up between them explodes on the pages when they do finally get their freak on\u2026 again and again and again. This story is definitely not lacking in the sexy times department. \n\u201cWhen his cock bobbed up for attention, I looked up at Bo. \u201cLet\u2019s hope you know how to use that monster.\u201d- AM\nThis book has some deep emotional moments, but it\u2019s also wonderfully funny. Between the mayonnaise experiment and Bo\u2019s most embarrassing story, I was laughing non-stop. The playful sparring between AM and Bo is laced with sharp, sarcastic humor and dipped in sexual tension \u2013 fantastic combination. Unspoken has just the right balance of romance, humor, emotion, drama, and awesome main and secondary characters. I absolutely adored Jen Frederick\u2019s hip, funny, poignant, and charming writing style. If you liked Easy by Tammara Webber, you will most likely enjoy this book. It has a rich college setting with a strong and sweet heroine and tattooed, bad boy hero that is easy to love.Rating: B+Heat: Hot\nFind us on Twitter and Facebook too!"}, {"userName": "Celestine", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13928747-celestine", "userReview": "Too new adult for my tastes, especially since the H had a tour in Afghanistan with the Marines and was an older college student.

Frankly, this book was awesome, but before I got into that, let me get all the technical babble out of the way. Unspoken is the second book in the Woodlands Series by Jen Frederick. It is told from dual third person point-of-views by the main two characters. It does have an HEA and it can be read as a standalone.I want to start off by saying that I actually couldn't get into this book at first. That alone basically discouraged me because I sat on myself and waited for a good three months before I'd even let myself start reading this book. Trust me, it wasn't the book, it was me. Once I was able to settle down and fully focus on Unspoken, I flat out consumed it. It touches on so many topics that you would face in college, or even high school for that matter. Not to mention everything else that goes with it. Throw in a hero that I was already crushing on, and an amazing heroine who stole my heart and I was completely rooting for by the end and you have one heck of a book.Bo, our hero in Unspoken, is a former Marine that followed his best friend to college after leaving the military. He feels like he's just floating with no purpose sometimes. His is seriously hot tempered, and has anger issues, which actually scares him. So he fighters, and by this I mean MMA, just not professionally. Bo enters a lot of underground fights, because that is the only way he knows to get his \"aggression\" out. He's also afraid of hurting people he cares about and it's a big reason he doesn't get close to people. Enter A.M. or AnnMarie into his life.A.M. has been at the same college for awhile, in fact, she used to stare at the back of Bo's head the year before. Problem is, she doesn't date, she doesn't talk to guys and she definitely doesn't attend any events on campus. Rumors have been flying about her for awhile now, ones she can't fight, or so she thinks. So she withdraws into herself and just attends classes but not much else. She won't even give Bo the time of day, but considering they get thrown together as lab partners for a class, she can't exactly ignore them. I loved AnnMarine, she's deals with and has dealt with so much BS due to what people perceive and because people think it's okay to spread rumors. Misery loves company, I suppose. She's got a backbone though, and is spunky. It's made her probably one of my favorite heroines this year.These two have a ton of chemistry. Chemistry that A.M. pretty much tries to flip a finger at, but she can't seem to help herself with it comes to Bo. She tries to remain detached but he worms his way in. Problem is, he's got issues of his own. So while these two explode, they also have to come into themselves, sort their problems and take care of the outside issues that can keep them apart.I would recommend this book probably until I'm blue in the face. I've rated it five stars, even though at first I couldn't get into it, as I said, that was me though.

Just\u2026.WOW!!!! This totally caught me by surprise. Unspoken is\n knock your socks off AMAZING\n! I FREAKING loved the hell out of this book! Every single minute from start to finish was simply fantastic. I haven't enjoyed a book this much in quite a while.Unspoken is a standout for me. The story is refreshingly new and doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s been done before. There\u2019s nothing more disappointing than picking up a book just to feel like I\u2019ve read it before \u2013 just with a different title and character names.\nMy (\u00af`\u2022.\u2022\u00b4\u00af) (\u00af`\u2022.\u2022\u00b4\u00af)*`\u2022.\u00b8(\u00af`\u2022.\u2022\u00b4\u00af)\u00b8.\u2022\u00b4 \u2665\u2665 `\u2022.\u00b8.\u2022\u00b4 \u2665 \u2665 belongs to Bo Randolph!!!!\nBo and AM are both strong characters you can\u2019t help but fall in love with. Their damaged pasts have helped paint the same reputation around campus but for very different reasons. Bo is the resident bad boy man-whore by choice. He sleeps around, stays unattached, has fun doing it, and makes no qualms about it. AM (Ann Marie) is branded the campus slut all because of vicious rumors and hearsay. She becomes the campus ghost and only steps foot on it when absolutely necessary. By chance (or not) they end up as partners in Biology. For the girl that has sworn off guys and the guy that has no interest in a relationship longer than one night, what they learn in Biology class becomes a very important lesson in life and love. \n \u201cHere was the secret to Bo\u2019s success. The outward package drew you in and the layered complexities that seemed at odds with his flight persona kept you engaged. I wanted to pull back those layers to find out what made him tick.\u201d \u2013 AM\nLet\u2019s talk about Bo for a minute (or two)\u2026\u2026\u2026.. OMG is Bo a charmer or what?!!?!?!? He will have you walking into walls, forgetting your name, and putting your lipstick on your eyes. I hate the term \u201cswoonworthy\u201d because it\u2019s so overused lately, but honestly there is no better term that adequately describes what Bo Randolph is \u2013 Marine, underground fighter, and all around hottie. He seems to not have a care in the world, but that\u2019s just what he wants the world to see. As much as she\u2019d like to be, AM isn\u2019t immune to his charms. Getting hurt by Bo could leave a permanent mark, but she also knows there\u2019s much much more to him.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think someone gets a crush on Bo Randolph and comes away unscathed.\u201d \u2013 AM\nAnd AM\u2026. she\u2019s a tough nut to crack, but Bo is determined to break through her shell. Something about AM is different, and she captures Bo\u2019s attention in a different way than he\u2019s used to. I loved AM's character. She\u2019s not weak or wishy-washy. She\u2019s strong, smart, and totally lovable. \n\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve had my share of hookups. All the girls I\u2019ve been with have wanted the same thing that I was looking for \u2013 a temporary hit off the endorphin bong. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s not going to be enough for me anymore. Not since I\u2019ve met you.\u201d \u2013 Bo\nSimply\u2026\u2026 I LOVED THIS BOOK. I honestly don\u2019t think I would change a single thing. I laughed, cried, and got weak in the knees. The chemistry between Bo and AM is wonderful, and the secondary characters really add to the story. This is definitely in my Top 10 for 2013. Unspoken is a book I will definitely reread at some point.

But everything about to change for Bo when AnnMarie (AM) is forced to take the seat next to him in class. He noticed her before, but she never paid too much attention so he just moved on to the next wiling girl. But now that\u2019s all changed, now that he\u2019s gotten to know her a little bit he isn\u2019t willing to just walk away.AM has hidden herself away since the vicious rumors started her freshmen year. Unwilling to run away, she opted to hide away instead. Sure she\u2019s attracted to Bo, what girl at the college isn\u2019t? But she\u2019s worked hard to remain under the radar to give into her feelings to easily. But slowly Bo starts to chip away at her walls, exposing the real reason why she\u2019s closed off. But while he points out what she\u2019s been doing by hiding, it exposes his own past and what has made him the way he is. Another sweet love story. There was a touch more drama in this particular installment, given the nature of AM being bullied and Bo\u2019s issues with his own past. But it was a feel good story to its core. I love when you can just fall in love with the characters right alongside of them. My love of romance is great, and as much as I love the dark/twisted ones and the angst filled ones, I love when a story can just hit that sweet spot that leaves you with a smile on your face when you\u2019re finished.

I have to say that I really enjoyed book 1 \u2013 Undeclared, Noah and Grace\u2019s story was well written, sweet and extremely hot all at the same time.Jen has done something that a lot of writers struggle to do with a series, and that is to offer a follow-up book that is actually better than the first. This series shows a huge amount of potential, and if the improvement in writing between books continues, I am preparing myself to be blown away in January 2014 when book 3, Unmarked is released.Unspoken focuses on Bo and AM\u2019s (this name is the only thing I didn\u2019t really like) story. Both of them are struggling to leave their pasts behind, due to malicious rumours, unfair judgements, untrue gossip, and deep rooted long standing family issues.Bo like Noah is an ex-marine who fights in his spare time, whilst studying for his degree. He meets AM in one of their classes and decides he wants her as his lab partner. Things go from there and he realises that there is more to AM\u2019s reluctance to spend time with him, and on campus in general than originally meets the eye.Through this book, you get both POV\u2019s and it made me laugh more than once reading Bo\u2019s internal monologue trying to rationalise his reactions and feelings to AM, and although the sex is pretty hot (Jen has definitely ramped it up again), my favourite part of the book was the Mayonnaise experiment, I was sitting reading in the park, laughing my ass off as all the dog walkers strolled by looking at me like I had lost my marbles.AM is the type of person, that as the book develops you want to laugh, cry and cheer for. The treatment she experiences at the hands of her peers, bought tears to my eyes several times, as being someone who has had to deal with bullies in her own life, I loved reading how she overcame the adversity with the help of her friends and loved ones. The strength she displayed in the face of this treatment was admirable and several times I found myself taking a breath, due to the emotions it bought back to me from my own experiences.This was a really enjoyable read, it covers several heavy topics, but they are covered really well, and I cannot wait for book 3 in January 2014.

That\u2019s not a bad thing, but it left me feeling like I had already read it at times (and consequently, a little bored at times). But, overall, I did find it to be an enjoyable read. I really liked Bo. In the previous book, Noah took the time prior to the book starting to get his head together before going after Grace. And even though we got the back story and history, we didn\u2019t actually see him work through all his issues. That wasn\u2019t the case with Bo. He got out of the Marines and followed Noah across the country to college. With Bo, you could see right away that he had issues. He was a little tougher, more rough around the edges. And I liked all of that about Bo. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really loved Noah, he worked in his story, but if Bo had been like that, I don\u2019t think it would have worked so well in this one. AnnMarie. She went through a lot of crap. A LOT. And all of it was undeserved. She tried the best she could to survive and finally decided that enough was enough. When she finally stood up and set the record straight, I was standing right there with her cheering her on. She deserves all kinds of happiness. I really hope that the author continues to write about Noah and Bo\u2019s friends. I want to know more about Mal, Adam, Finn and Gray. I can\u2019t wait to read more from the author.

I didn't really like the first Woodlands book. I thought the characters were too perfect, and there wasn't enough conflict or tension to draw me in. I was kind of bored. And I said so, honestly, in my review. I guess it was too sugary sweet for me.You can imagine my surprise when the author asked me if I'd be willing to read this book in hopes that I'd like it better. I hoped so, too, so of course, I said yes.This book was a pleasant improvement (to me) over the first. It dealt with some realistic issues about bullying (the REAL kind, not the 'imagined bullying' stemming from disagreements with total strangers on the internet). It had imperfect characters, and it had conflict and tension, but fortunately, not the OTT crap that I always complain about being prevalent in so many NA books today.And it had a really funny segment about superglue. ^_~ That was priceless.The only mini-gripe I had was that I wanted better closure with the villain. Yes, there's comeuppance, but not quite as satisfying as I would have liked (I admit to being a bit bloodthirsty when it comes to revenge justice).If you liked Undeclared, you will really like Unspoken."}, {"userName": "Flavs is Mrs David Gandy\u2665~\u2665\u2019", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10136059-flavs-is-mrs-david-gandy", "userReview": "AAH Bo!!! <3"}, {"userName": "*The Angry Reader*", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/840454-the-angry-reader", "userReview": "There were aspects of this book that I really enjoyed. It went deeper than the average NA. I've read at least 10 books where the heroine was slut-shamed, but usually there's little detail or else it's completely over the top. Frederick found a balance to make AM's experiences feel real. I also liked that there was a build-up to the physical aspect of their relationship. There may have been some Insta-lust upon first sight, but things developed at a non-terrifying speed.AM is the target of college slut-shaming and bullying. Bo is a kind of badass ladies' man. (There's actual self-reflection about Bo's sexual exploits. And no weird scenes with him and other women. Plus there is fully-realized irony when comparing Bo's behavior to AM's and the general reaction to men's sexuality v women's.) They dig each other, but they have reservations. These weren't issues that could be resolved with a conversation. AM and Bo had things to work on and work out before they had a chance at being together.I thought things got a little clunky in the second half. Frederick, in an effort to step outside the mainstream \"tell tell tell\" had a stretch where the sequence of events was a little muddy. And I thought the ending was too long. (That's completely subjective though - some readers want to see their characters happily-ever-after. I don't need everything tied with a bow and dropped in my lap. I just like to know they're okay.)

Those who enjoyed Tammara Webber\u2019s Easy will most likely enjoy Unspoken because the college setting is rich here (Jen has a skill at getting the college atmosphere correct) with a strong heroine and a very sweet and understanding hero. The subject of sex, as in the act, plays a heavy role also, regarding a person\u2019s history or lack of. The big discussion lies about gender roles and how sex plays a part, specifically with a person\u2019s reputation. If a woman gains a reputation for sleeping around, she\u2019s labeled a \u201cslut\u201d, but if her male sexual partner has the same reputation as the woman, he\u2019s applauded for scoring and allowed to spread vicious lies to make him more popular, while the woman is bullied and ostracized.This is the case of our main protagonist, AnnMarie, better known as AM. She made the mistake one night after having too much to drink at a party filled with Lacrosse players. She ended up losing her virginity to one of these players, but can\u2019t remember who. Because of that experience, word got around she was easy, and now out of all the girls on her college campus for some odd reason, she\u2019s marked with a Scarlett letter for being a slut thanks to the Lacrosse team. One of the players, Clay, a real asshat, has it in for AM because she refused to be one of his conquests after he tried in a very aggressive way to comprise her. Why Clay has this disturbing and obsessive way in bullying AM (he leaves nasty notes on her car and ridicules her in pubic) isn\u2019t fully revealed. But AM won\u2019t transfer to another college and refuses to cower because of these cruel people who are cruel just because they enjoy getting off on it.AM ends up Biology lab partners with Bo Randolf, a former Marine and overall nice guy who gets his kicks in underground fighting. This is his drug of choice, that is until he meets AM. He doesn\u2019t care about the rumors or AM\u2019s sexual past. Bo has no right to judge because he has had more than his share of sex experience. AM wants to keep her distance from Bo, but he slowly inches his way into her heart and proves he\u2019s not only interested in making AM a notch on his bedpost. It all comes down to AM accepting Bo and pushing aside her doubts that continue to chase her.Thank you, Jen for a hero like Bo. He\u2019s beyond dreamy, but not just because he\u2019s handsome and has an appealing personality. He has an extreme respect for women and an acute understanding that\u2019s perfectly shown with AM. These two have great chemistry together, and their love scenes are very hot and well written. AM tended to be a bit grating at times, but then again she is the subject of massive ridicule because of having the reputation of being a slut, which I can\u2019t figure out why she, on this big college campus, was the only one targeted. I wish this was better explained because it didn\u2019t make any sense to me.The way AM takes back her dignity and self confidence will have you cheering her on, but it didn\u2019t feel realistic when all was said and done. She gives this big speech at a party toward the end of the story that just seems out of left field. But I did enjoy how Bo and his buddies get back at those who have harassed AM, mainly Clay. That was one twist I never saw coming.In all, the writing here is great and you become invested in Bo and AM\u2019s HEA. Jen does have a great voice and is welcomed addition to the New Adult category.

Bo and AM are partners in biology, and are both very attracted to each other. Other than that, there wasn't much else to the story. I was bored from about 33% on. There were a few good sex scenes, Bo realized he can like just one woman for more than just sex. AM got a back bone and stood up for herself. They each have their own jacked up families. Other than that......There wasn't any grit or any action I could sink my teeth into. It was them just...existing. Day to day crap. At least in book 1 Noah was actively pursuing Grace.
