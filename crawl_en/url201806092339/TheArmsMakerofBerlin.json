He is a historian so engrossed in his discipline that it comes as a complete surprise when his wife files for divorce. The object of his obsession is World War II Germany, specifically, the search for undisclosed machinations \u2013betrayals. Along with his former mentor, Gordon Wolfe, he is fascinated by the architecture of failure. \u201cJust as when a building collapsed no one wasted time studying the parts that didn't fail. Look deeply enough into the origins of some huge movement in history, they believed, and you would inevitably find a personal snub, a romantic breakup, or some kind of thwarted ambition.\u201d Poring over texts and artifacts, then, is only a beginning for both of them. The critical link is the emotional state of not only the participants, but the ripple of unintended consequences inflicted upon their successors. It is no wonder that Nat is fascinated with visiting the buildings and streets where history took place. His imagination is able to conjure the optimism and fears of the players who once walked those streets.The plot is classic thriller. Nat is summoned to the Adirondacks by Gordon's wife. Gordon has been arrested \u2013 accused of stealing government files. Despite an unresolved estrangement, Nat rushes to assist Gordon, who claims the files were planted. At the arraignment, he meets a mysterious German woman named Berta who also seems to be following the case with interest. Gordon is in his 80's now. A charming raconteur whose tales are fueled by a balance of alcohol and erudition. Plus, in his youth, he actually worked with the OSS in Bern, and so had first-hand knowledge of many of the Nazi's fleeing Germany. A parallel story follows the war-time activities of Kurt Bauer, now in his 80's, head of a powerful armaments manufacturer. Bauer's clandestine contacts reach to Washington DC, Tehran and, coincidentally, a small town in the Adirondacks. His story, however, begins in December of 1941. Hitler has already invaded Russia. It is both surprising and sobering to hear that even at that early stage, many knew that the invasion was not going well, and that suspected that the war was unwinnable, despite the government's propaganda.Thus, the reader is left with several mysteries to be pursued. First, what is the connection between Nat Turnbull's investigation and Kurt Bauer's story? Second, were the files actually planted in Gordon's house, by whom, and why? Finally, who is the mysterious woman, Berta, and what is her interest in Gordon? Bauer's story seems to be a coming of age tale of first love and naivete. Dietrich Bonhoffer and later, Allen Dulles have brief cameo roles to play in this developing drama. Unfortunately, I found this thread, though crucial, less interesting than Nat's present-day pursuit for lost files, and secret code names. Readers who found both parts of the story equally riveting will be able to rate this book more positively. A second flaw was the absence of a sense of danger to Turnbull. There are hints, but I failed to find them convincing. I felt ambivalent about this book, although on the whole, I enjoyed it. (I also enjoyed S. McGee's review on Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/Maker-Berlin-Vi...)What elevates this book from the ordinary is Festerman's disciplined respect for history. Both Nat and Gordon are interested in the seeds of betrayal. Festerman's exploration provides both answers and further questions. He shows us Dietrich Bonhoeffer wrestling with the contradictions of his own theological beliefs, and how an abstraction comes to be ignited into action: \u201c...the difference between a cheap grace \u2013 one that comes easily and is all talk \u2013 and a costly grace, one where you are willing to make true sacrifice and take real risks.\u201d Or, is the seed Liesl's angry declaration to Bauer: \u201cWhat does it matter if you are 'silenced' if you have nothing to say to begin with?\u201d Then, like his historian protagonist, Festerman follows the many variations betrayal can take. For him, there is no simple dichotomy between loyalty and betrayal."}, {"userName": "Kent Babin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59060510-kent-babin", "userReview": "I must admit that, having not read the book\u2019s description or looked closely at the cover, I was completely surprised that this book had a World War Two theme to it. What I simply assumed would be a modern terrorist thriller was actually about a historian in search of a heavily guarded truth. I may have been a trifle disappointed during the first chapter, but things improved once the plot got going.What I LikedFesperman continues to impress me with the range of historical periods he has covered in his novels up to this point. Mid-90s Bosnia, post-9/11 Afghanistan and Jordan, Guantanamo Bay, and now Nazi Germany.Unlike the previous book, The Amateur Spy, there weren\u2019t pages of backstory to sift through before getting the plot going.I\u2019ve read a number of novels set in Nazi Germany, but this one seemed unique in that it detailed the lives of the non-Nazi Party elites.The differences in style and pace really helped bring out the flashbacks.What I Didn\u2019t LikeThings seemed to come together a little too perfectly at the end.The main character, Nat, seemed overly clever for someone thrust into an international mystery plot. There wasn\u2019t much of a learning curve and he was far too confident that nothing would happen to him.I\u2019m still not sure I understand Berta\u2019s motives for her behaviour. Obsessive, okay, but I don\u2019t see why she wasn\u2019t more cooperative. And, although she wasn\u2019t exactly what she seemed, the real Berta was hardly sinister.RecommendationThrillers like this that provide background and knowledge about a historical period are definitely worth reading. Fesperman has always excelled at this. While I still think his first two books set in Bosnia are his best works (of the ones of I\u2019ve read), it\u2019s definitely worth reading this one if you have an interest in World War Two."}, {"userName": "Charles Matthews", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3010528-charles-matthews", "userReview": "\u201cIntelligent thriller\u201d is almost an oxymoron, given that the whole purpose of the genre is to ... well, you know, thrill. I mean, nobody reads Dan Brown for serious insight into the history of Christianity and the politics of the Roman Catholic church. (Well, they shouldn't, anyway.) All that ingenious plot-twisting and hair's-breadth-escaping from deadly intrigue tends to annihilate anything like thought.Which may be why novels like Dan Fesperman's are so rare \u2013 or at any rate not as popular as Brown's, or James Patterson's, or any number of other masters of the nonstop page-turner. Fesperman just can't help drawing on his experience as a journalist covering foreign conflicts, most recently for the Baltimore Sun. And that experience puts the meat on the intricate bone structure of his thriller plots. You come away from a Fesperman novel not only abuzz with the exhilaration of the chase, but also aware that you've absorbed something of the complexity of the world's conflicts, grown more keenly aware that they're are a lot more complicated than politicians and ideologues make them out to be.Fesperman's \u201cThe Prisoner of Guant\u00e1namo,\u201d for example, gave the reader a glimpse of the culture of that notorious place of incarceration, more vivid and subtle than anything you'd find in news reports, and it did so in the guise of a murder mystery and a spy chase. \u201cThe Amateur Spy\u201d took us to a crossroads of Middle Eastern terrorist intrigue and discovered something that's easy to forget: Human beings with the essential traits of being human \u2013 hopes, ideals, needs, desires, as well as cruelty and weakness and fallibility -- dwell there.The typical Fesperman hero is a guy with a certain amount of expertise and often a shadowed past who finds that experience and expertise aren't always quite enough to keep him out of trouble. Usually, as in any good thriller, there's a beautiful woman involved, one who is almost certainly not what she seems. So it is with with \u201cThe Arms Maker of Berlin\u201d: Nat Turnbull, mild-mannered history professor, finds himself in cahoots (and bed) with a mysterious and alluring German woman, Berta Heinkel, as they try to locate some documents that may have led to the death of Turnbull's mentor, a retired, alcoholic and recently disgraced historian.These documents are not just a Hitchcockian McGuffin, the gimmick that drives the plot, but they're also a portal into the history of Germany in the twentieth century. They have to do with the dark past of Kurt Bauer, a German industrialist best known to the public as a manufacturer of household appliances but also ... well, the title kind of gives it away. And what puts Turnbull into thriller-style jeopardy is not only that Bauer, described by one character as \u201ca man whose little black book could help someone build the next nuclear weapon,\u201d may be aiding and abetting some bad guys (i.e., Iranians), but also that the United States intelligence agencies have a pretty strong interest in not letting the truth about Bauer be known. As a historian, Turnbull is dedicated to uncovering the truth, but the FBI, which hires him to lead them to the documents, would just as soon keep it covered, alternately abetting and thwarting Turnbull's search.While the story of Turnbull's sleuthing unfolds, Fesperman also flashes back sixty-odd years to the story of young Kurt Bauer, who at 17 falls in love with a pretty girl, Liesl Folkerts, who belongs to an anti-Hitler group known as the White Rose. For Bauer, love trumps politics, and that leads him to do something that has grave consequences, an action recorded in the documents Turnbull is looking for. Both stories \u2013 Turnbull's and Bauer's \u2013 are deftly told, the fiction underpinned with historical details and populated with real human beings such as the German anti-Hitler theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer and the American spymaster Allen Dulles. And Fesperman's fictional characters, particularly Kurt Bauer, are smartly imagined and subtly drawn.But what truly animates the novel is Fesperman's awareness of how the calamitous history of Germany in the twentieth century continues to inform current events. From Turnbull's point of view \u2013 and Fesperman's \u2013 the \u201ccast of players\u201d is \u201cModern Germany made flesh, in all its macabre and tragic grandeur.\u201d \u201cThe Arms Maker of Berlin\u201d doesn't have quite the breathless immediacy and headlong action of Fesperman's ripped-from-the-headlines terrorism tales, \u201cThe Prisoner of Guant\u00e1namo\u201d and \u201cThe Amateur Spy\u201d, which makes it less successful as a thriller. But on the intelligence side of the \u201cintelligent thriller\u201d conundrum, it's a stronger and subtler, and perhaps more satisfying book."}, {"userName": "Speesh", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4052463-speesh", "userReview": "Spies and the second world war. Who doesn't love stories about one or the other?Spies in the Second World War? Getting better.Spies today and spies in the Second World War - Now that's a match made in some sort of secret (service) heaven for me.So 'The Arms Maker of Berlin' had ticked all my right boxes even before I began reading it. And I wasn't disappointed when I finished. Actually, I was disappointed, but only that I had finished it.What's it about? Hard to pin down without writing a review nearly as long as the book itself, really. Events in Nazi Germany in the closing months of the Second World War, love and betrayal - on many levels - the ripples this causes through the various protagonist's lives through the intervening, post-war partition of Germany, to re-unification and into today's international espionage world.\u00a0I found the book really quite moving and genuinely thought-provoking. Yes, there are spies; war-time spies, cold-war spies, the start of the CIA, the Stasi in East Germany and the current international espionage wars of today. It is also about a much more intimate picture of love and emotion and what the emotions caused by love, made people do when under almost unimaginable pressures, like the Second World War. People finding that love and war makes it almost impossible for them to do right, for doing wrong. And about how the effects of World War II, still reach out to today; the emotional 'ripples' from that period, are still being felt.The book's timeline moves back and forth between the early 1940's and the present day and you will have to pay attention. But it then pays dividends as the story develops and secrets, motives and why people did what they did, gradually become clear.As I say, I thoroughly enjoyed this one and whilst the cover comment about Dan Fesperman being the new John le Carr\u00e9, is inappropriately wide of the mark, this is nonetheless one of the best novels I've read in a long time."}, {"userName": "Johann Coetzer", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14538702-johann-coetzer", "userReview": "No book has made me so lividly angry that I want to tare it up and burn it, and I do mean that in a very positive way, Dan Fesperman has done a really great job with this book he filled it with suspense, and then he cuts it off to go back to the past then builds up and reverts back to the present, it keeps you glued to the pages, before you know it it is 3am in the morning and you are still reading this was my first interdiction into the spy novel genre and I must say it Brilliant!"}, {"userName": "Chip", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1622905-chip", "userReview": "Disappointing, particularly in comparison to The Small Boat of Great Sorrows.

Berlin was the seat of the vicious Nazi regime. Bern was where those Germans with the financial means and connections in high places went to escape the rigors of life in a country at war. Kurt Bauer, son of Rheinhold Bauer, the eponymous Arms Maker, is infatuated with Liesl Folkerts, a vivid and outspoken girl whom he met at the home of Wilhelm Stuckart, second in command at the Reich Interior Ministry. Liesl mentions that she and some others gather at the home of Pastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer, despised by some Germans because he spoke out, albeit mildly and in the form of appealing to people's better natures, against what he was witnessing in the country. Liesl invited Kurt to attend an up-coming get-together. We then meet some of the White Rose members, young Germans who decided to fight against the Nazi terror by writing, printing and distributing pamphlets. Here is the second offering by the founding group in Munich: \"nothing is so unworthy of a civilized nation as to allow itself to be \"governed\" without any opposition by an irresponsible clique that has yielded to basest instincts. It is certainly the case today that every honest German is ashamed of his government.\" Kurt joins the newly-forming White Rose cell in Berlin, not so much out of conviction as a desire to be close to Liesl, the spirited leader of the group. This was in spite of a conversation Kurt had had with Pastor Bonhoeffer in which the Pastor warned him that any possible sentimentss for Liesl must be matched by equally strong feelings for the White Rose movement. Kurt cast this injunction aside, and in order to gain favor with the Nazis to facilitate his family's departure for Bern, he betrayed the group, the members of which were rounded up and imprisoned. Part of Kurt's devil's bargain with his Nazi interlocutor was that Liesl was not to be harmed. Three members of the group were executed, Liesl was killed outside the prison by shrapnel, her release papers in her hand, found by Kurt who had also been released.Fast forward to the present where Nat Turnbull is a professor of history at Wightman University, specializing in modern Germany from the Weimar Republic of 1919 through the long, deadly shadows of Hitler's Third Reich. He is deep in the university's storage vaults when he receives a phone call at 1.04 am, from a number he recognizes as that of his erstwhile mentor Gordon Wolfe. It is Gordon's wife Viv. She reported that Gordon had been arrested. The FBI arrived and took him away, alleging he had stolen some valuable archives. Viv said that when she and Gordon arrived after dinner out, at their cottage in the Adirondacks \"there was a pile of boxes sitting there, right on the kitchen table.\" Gordon said they were planted, nevertheless he was taken away to the local jail at Blue Kettle Lake. Nat is surprised by an FBI agent who was hidden in the library stacks and says he has been ordered to take Nat to look at the archive Gordon was alleged to have stolen. Upon his arrival at Gordon and Viv's cottage, the FBI agent in charge, Clark Holland, asks Nat to have a quick look at the documents. A cursory examination confirmed to Nat that these were long missing historical papers from the Nazi era, with an emphasis on The White Rose resistance group. Why, you might ask, somebody be interested in this coterie of idealistic young Germans? Because Kurt Bauer had betrayed the White Rose. Is it he who is trying to find the archives or other ex-Nazis? When Gordon dies in prison it is not known if he was killed or died from lack of his heart medication. It is then up to Nat to find out who is behind the resurfacing of the archive and Gordon's death, believing the two must be connected.Nat travels to Bern, Switzerland, and Berlin, Germany, accompanied by a German academic whose motives may be self-serving. Nat discovers that Gordon was been an ace spy under Allen Dulles at the OSS in Bern. He was his own primary source when it came to writing about WW11. Nat also enounters Kurt Bauer, now a rich, irascible old man with secrets to keep. All will be revealed, dear reader, when you read this suspenseful, enthralling thriller."}, {"userName": "Lawrence", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4760011-lawrence", "userReview": "Nat Turnbull is a present day historian who has surpassed his mentor in their chosen field of focus, the German Resistance during World War Two.

The story is appropriately convoluted for the genre, involving a naive anti-Nazi resistance group in Berlin, the impending collapse of the Third Reich, OSS activities in Switzerland, and how all these connect to the present. And rest assured they do -- as Dr. Nat Turnbull, a semi-distinguished professor of modern German history at a small liberal-arts college, discovers when he is hired to track down some old OSS files hidden by his mentor at the college.Turnbull (like pretty much every character in the book) is a stock figure, he's the anonymous academic who gets sucked into a great intrigue with national security implications (paging Dr. Jones, Dr. Indiana Jones to the front please, your country needs you to fight Nazis). It seems these old missing files have something to do with present-day nuclear weapons proliferation, and since the FBI apparently doesn't have the expertise to find them, they enlist Dr. Turnbull. This is a pretty flimsy way of setting up a kind of \"everyman\" protagonist, and it only continues to be unconvincing as the story moves along. But you just have to accept the premise and move on if you want to have any hope of enjoying the book.What follows is a treasure hunt that takes Dr. Turnbull all over the place, from Baltimore to the National Archives outside Washington, to Florida, Switzerland, various parts of Germany, and so on. Tagging along with him for parts of this quest is his unreliable ally, a mysterious German academic with her own agenda. Meanwhile, alternating chapters take us back to wartime Germany and the relationships among members of a feeble resistance cell. The historically-set material is much more interesting than the contemporary chapters, as we get a real sense of how certain parts of German society were trying to position themselves for the inevitable Allied victory. Alas, the characters of both eras are types rather than people, and there is plenty of quite creaky dialogue throughout.The story is full of twists and turns and deceit, all of which work perfectly well but somehow feel rather formulaic. You could spend your whole life reading nothing but thrillers revolving around Nazi Germany, so it takes a lot to stand out. (For example, this book has little of the detail that bring Philip Kerr's Berlin Noir  trilogy to vivid life, nor do they have the striking atmosphere of Alan Furst's excellent spy novels). The book tries gamely to provide that big twist at the end that readers expect from thrillers, unfortunately I saw it coming a mile away (in the first third of the book I had a pretty good idea that an assumption had been made regarding a certain character that would be revealed at the very end to be untrue, and I was right). In the end, I can't say I'm glad I read it, but neither can I say it's not worth reading. It's a serviceable thriller that passes the time pleasantly enough, as long you keep your expectations lowish."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54752-john", "userReview": "This spy novel is set in the present day and in World War II Germany and Switzerland.

I enjoyed the World War II segments best, particularly because one of the historical characters in those chapters was Dietrich Bonhoeffer. He plays a small but significant role in the narrative, and it was clear to me that Fesperman wrote with more than a superficial knowledge of Bonhoeffer. I was impressed.My favorite part about the present-day segments was the relationship between Turnbull and his college-age daughter, and the fact that they would quote Emily Dickinson poems to each other.

Fesperman brings to life the horrors of living in a society where you can trust no one, not even those you love. He doesn't seem to have an axe to grind and doesn't 'moralize.' The result is a book that has left me with a lot to think about it...it is a story that will stay on my mind long after I've read the last page."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Eckel", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2465880-jennifer-eckel", "userReview": "A good book, really close to 4 stars. I had trouble with the author's pacing. There was no upward intensity and big climax. There was a climax, though I think I'd say a big twist, and a bit surprising. One gets to go the bad guy through his history, not his modern day to day life and that I think was a failing of the novel.Characters were also good, anything with a historian who knows arcane details is always good! And this hero did. The plot needed just a bit more oomph, and a few details needed better explaining. Still if one wants to read a WWII yarn this one is pretty good.I think this book did explore in a unique way who is the good guy and the bad guy which even in Germany today (2014) is still being explored."}, {"userName": "Kandice", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2617370-kandice", "userReview": "I enjoyed reading this book. It had a mystery, intrigue, surprises - everything I'm sure a good spy novel should have. It was well written and well researched, and you cared what happened to some of the characters (unfortunately mostly the peripheral ones, in my opinion). But I'm not a huge fan of political intrigue and spy novels, especially those having to do with any war. I read this book for a book club, and while I did enjoy reading it, I probably won't read another book by this author for the reasons listed above. However, if you like spy novels and historical intrigues, I would recommend reading this author."}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4250414-stephen", "userReview": "For those who love historical fiction on World War II, this is a must read. The 'White Rose' was a real resistance group during the War and many of it's members paid the ultimate price. Nat Turnbull is a research historian digging into the past to look for missing documents from his recently deceased mentor, Gordon Wolfe. The book touches base with real people and alleged conspiracies.The pace is fast and swings back and forth from Germany of the 40s to the present in order to connect the dots from the good guys and bad guys of World War II to the heroes and villains of the present."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/970762-jim", "userReview": "It was OK. It's got a Nazi-connected mystery, a professor/amateur investigator as protagonist, and modern intrigue dating back to the aforementioned mystery. Plus, there are some Iranian spies running around (although they don't do much).On the face of it, it sounds like a good read, but I found it kind of flat. Granted, it picks up the pace in the last third of the story, but all in all it left me disappointed. This is especially true, considering the quality of Fesperman's first book, Lie in the Dark."}, {"userName": "Richard", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2250822-richard", "userReview": "Present day: our hero, the historian is approached by the FBI to help out his mentor.

I enjoyed the combination of mystery, thriller, and some history of German life and American spying history during WW2; from resistance, to collaboration, to betrayal and spying, as well complications of life during these times as the war was rolling on. The role of a contemporary American academic historian's in trying to aid his former mentor in all of it adds another level of intrigue and action."}], "description": "This powerfully suspenseful new novel from Dan Fesperman takes us deep into the early 1940s in Switzerland and Germany as it traces the long reach of the wartime intrigues of the White Rose student movement, which dared to speak out against Hitler.When Nat Turnbull, a history professor who specializes in the German resistance, gets the news that his estranged mentor, Gordon Wolfe, has been arrested for possession of stolen World War II archives, he\u2019s hardly surprised that, even at the age of eighty-four, Gordon has gotten himself in trouble. But what\u2019s in the archives is staggering: a spymaster\u2019s trove missing since the end of the war, one that Gordon has always claimed is full of \u201csecrets you can\u2019t find anywhere else . . . live ammunition.\u201dYet key documents are still missing, and Nat believes Gordon has hidden them. The FBI agrees, and when Gordon is found dead in jail, the Bureau dispatches Nat to track down the material, which has also piqued the interest of several dangerous competitors. As he follows a trail of cryptic clues left behind by Gordon, assisted by an attractive academic with questionable motives, Nat\u2019s quest takes him to Bern and Berlin, where his path soon crosses that of Kurt Bauer, an aging German arms merchant still hoarding his own wartime secrets. As their stories\u2014and Gordon\u2019s\u2014intersect across half a century, long-buried exploits of deceit, devotion, and doomed resistance begin working their way to the surface. And as the stakes rise, so do the risks . . .", "title": "The Arms Maker of Berlin", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6368267-the-arms-maker-of-berlin", "average": 3.68, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320486759l/6368267.jpg", "reviews": 98, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/38235.Dan_Fesperman", "name": "Dan Fesperman"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Historical", "Mystery", "Thriller", "War"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6368267-the-arms-maker-of-berlin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8420804-the-arms-maker-of-berlin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7020692-the-arms-maker-of-berlin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7020693-the-arms-maker-of-berlin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13330937-the-double-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25776133-the-letter-writer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7632099-layover-in-dubai", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/624653.The_Small_Boat_of_Great_Sorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/67823.Lie_In_The_Dark", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
