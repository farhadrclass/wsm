He reveals the spiritual influences both good and bad pitting the Catholic Church against the Gypsies of Tirana. I can relate having been in Seville, in the church of Tirana, and having attended bullfights. There is something majestic and mystical about bullfights.

I tried to read 2 other books of his and though I like his perspective, they are incredibly slow going. This one was far less painful. Not a topic I\u2019d expect to be into at all ... but he drew me in.Definitely worth the read."}, {"userName": "Bill Currie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3156026-bill-currie", "userReview": "Not only a beautiful study in bull fighting, it provided the cultural significant tied to both religion and mysticism.

After witnessing a bullfight in Spain when I was young, I had to agree with Tom Lehrer that, \u201cI hadn\u2019t had so much fun since the day\u2026that my brother\u2019s dog Rover\u2026got run over\u2026\u201d I suspected that there was more to bullfighting than met the eye, even though such a sight will never meet with my eyes again. I was fairly successful at laying aside my prejudices to enjoy this short (for Michener) book.Simple yet beautiful two-color line drawings compliment the text. Illustrator John Fulton portrays the world of bulls and bullfighters so well that it is no surprise to learn that he is an American matador based in Seville.Michener speaks in first person, casting himself as an American sports journalist on assignment. His descriptions of the styles and personalities of the four most popular matadors and his own relationship with the bull rancher are intriguing. His enthusiasm for the sport is obvious, and though his language is not extremely graphic, he does not sugar-coat the more brutal aspects of bullfighting. **spoiler alert!**Michener tells a tall tale of an old rancher, Don Cayetano, formerly among the most famous of bull breeders, producing bulls that fought bravely and honorably in the ring. Don Cayetano\u2019s reputation had slipped throughout the years, and he prays to the Virgin Mary to restore quality to his bulls and honor to his family name. Even as he prays, his nemesis Lazaro Lopez, the cowardly gypsy matador, who seeks to dishonor the bulls, also prays, and their conflict drives much of the plot.I was enjoying the book quite a bit but really did not like the ending. If Hollywood ever makes this a movie, they will change that."}, {"userName": "Lynn Alan Heath", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4569364-lynn-alan-heath", "userReview": "I usually like James Michener even though his books may have something I disagree with (Chesapeake begins with the assumption that evolution is fact, if I remember the book correctly). Miracle In Seville is filled with Catholic false doctrine. Not only that, but there is some Bible quoting that is just inaccurate quoting (the Scriptures do no where say that \"Jesus had resurrected and risen to heaven\" nor do they call Mary \"the mother of God\"). I was disappointed by such a lacks regard for the Bible."}, {"userName": "Alex Teixeira", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2780857-alex-teixeira", "userReview": "I recently wanted to buy a copy of this book for a friend and discovered that here in the United States, the book is out of print, though you can still find \"new\" copies in a few places.

In this case, the topics of bullfighting, gypsies, and veneration of Mary hold little appeal for me, but Michener made them interesting. And I'm glad he wrote a book I could finish in four days!"}, {"userName": "David E.", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43492051-david-e", "userReview": "Overall I enjoyed the book, and the way it painted such moving and ultimately tragic characters in a short and simple tale. It's a quick read and although I found the \"miracle\" to be something of a disappointment, the joy in this book is getting to the climactic end as opposed to the end itself. Even the characters you are suppose to hate emerge as surprisingly complex by the final pages, quite an accomplishment for a novella of 107 pages."}, {"userName": "Ron", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8717740-ron", "userReview": "A relaxing few hours of reading about Matadors & bull fighting in Spain.As I was wondering around Newport Beach's Main Library looking for something that I have not read, I was surprised to find a book by James Michener of only 107 pages.
