Loving so many of the characters prevalent in the previous books I wanted to see what they were up to. However, upon completing Midnight Tides I am still in awe with Erikson, his style, substance and the stories that are being weaved. Every title he has written in this series I struggle to comprehend how they get better than the previous books.The plot is about two local communities and we get a great omnipotent perspective provided mostly as a tale of two families. Sengar (Tiste Edur) & Beddict (The Letherii). The relationships between the brothers on both sides is intriguing. Two races that have not been interpreted to any great degree prior to this book yet I imagine what has happened here is pivotal to the overall consequences of the series. Some of the scenes are amazing. The Sengar brothers fighting Soltaken wolves to find a requested prize on fields of ice, the meeting of the two factions are the Letherii throne & Kettle finally meeting Silchas Ruin. Additionally I liked the complexity of Rhulad and his relationship with his servant. (I don't consider these to be spoilers hence why I put them here :) ) Once again, Gods are in the mix of the action like the Aenied and the Iliad. I believe what makes this series stand out is its originality. I like a lot of fantasy novels but a lot of them are re-jigging Tolkien or what has come before. The world, races and epic-ness depicted here is astronomical and I truly believe I will not be able to enjoy fantasy books to this degree after this series as I know its quality cannot (or would be highly unlikely that it will) be replicated.I loved Tehol & Bugg's relationship. I imagined a sort of Blackadder/ Baldrick scenario with the 'manservant' however being cleverer than he made out. Bugg was always too busy to work. Hmmm. I cannot wait to read the next book. A lot of what I said in my positive review of House Of Chains could be placed here but I do not wish to repeat. If you have got this far in the series, you know it is amazing and reviews are pointless. Carry on, enjoy it. I can't wait to see how everything weaves it's way together, culminates and finalises.

These are the dominant themes presiding over the fifth chapter of the Malazan Book of the Fallen, which opened with a Prologue dated back to the Time of the Elder Gods, providing yet another history lesson into this deeply complex world. One would expect that progressing through the series should only get easier right? It seems though that Erikson decided to up the ante for worldbuilding by bringing the reader to a completely new far-flung continent and an entire cast of new characters. There is only ONE name that is familiar in the Dramatis Personae, one whom we met in the previous book - Trull Sengar. It turns out that Midnight Tides is dedicated to relate the story of how Trull ended up being in his position in the Prologue to the House of Chain and is a follow through from its Epilogue as his new friend proclaimed an interest in its retelling.This is the story of a kingdom which was prophesized to be reborn as an empire at the end of what is known as the Seventh Closure. The Letherii exhibited all the evils of greed and, in its intransigent belief of their destiny to rule as an empire, had been subjugating the various lands and races in the continent of Lether. The only remaining people yet to fall were the Tiste Edur, the children of Shadow, a people which were living a lie of a betrayal so great that it shattered a land. To approach this book without getting a whiplash, you need to be prepared to treat Midnight Tides as a completely fresh story. It is easier said than done, however. That learning all new characters and cultures again made for a rough start was a bit of an understatement. Even the basis of magical power and the gods were different here as instead of the Deck of Dragons and the Houses, we have the more antiquated form of Tiles and Holds. Thankfully, Erikson's narrative continues to improve with each and every subsequent book. The almost effortless flow of the story and the POV switching really helped to smoothen the reading experience. As always, character development was top-notch. Through the multitude POVs between the Letherii and the Tiste Edur, the one thing that stood out most to me was how this were the stories of three brothers. \n\nThe history of this decade, for our dear Letheras, can be most succinctly understood by a faithful recounting of the three Beddict brothers. And, as is clear, the tale's not done yet.\n\n The King's Champion, the ex-Sentinel and the Diabolical Genius - three Letherii brothers with a poignant story to tell. One of these brothers, Tehol Beddict and his manservant, Bugg, make up my favourite Malazan duo of all time. It was through their perspective that one can gain some appreciation of the Letherii outside of courtly intrigue and conspiracies, which made all the more enjoyable with its dry and sarcastic humour, laced with sharp intellect, hence providing a much-needed dose of lightheartedness.\n\nNo one spoke after that, not for some time. They drank their wine, and it seemed to Trull that something was present, some part of his life he'd thought - not long gone, but non-existent in the first place. They sat, the three of them. Brothers, and nothing more.\n\n The Sengars of the Tiste Edur were made up of four brothers to be exact, but I felt that the story was mostly told between three of them. It was every bit as empathetic as that of the Beddicts, if not more. As the Edurs embraced a deadly power that they did not understand, one filled with ravenous hunger for vengeance, the story spiralled ever further into the dark depths of madness, of greed and the poison of power. \n\nGreed and savagery unleashed, fear and panic triggering brutality and ruthless indifference.\n\n At risk of sounding repetitious, I cannot ignore mentioning how epic some of the battle scenes were, albeit this time it was because of the OP level of sorcery unleashed instead of the tactical military brilliance we've seen in Deadhouse Gates (which for me were still the best ones in the series thus far because of the Chain of Dogs).Slaughterous sorcery Art by Lauren Saint-OngeIn spite of the unfamiliar setting of this instalment, there were stunning revelations herein which offered a connectedness to the overarching tale that had already been told in the previous books. A couple or so subplots seemed a bit out of place though and appear to serve as an extended prologue for future books. Coupled with some strange dream sequences, which as usual, did not sit well with me, I did not have the same level of enjoyment reading Midnight Tides as I did with the first three books of the series. Notwithstanding, this is still a very solid entry into the Malazan Book of the Fallen and only continues to demonstrate the brilliance of Erikson in creating such an immersive world and telling such compelling stories of possibility the largest cast of characters I've encountered in a series thus far. \nThe world has drawn breath.. and now breathes once more. As steady as ever, as unbroken in rhythm as the tides. For such is the rhythm of these particular tides. Now, with the coming of night, when the shadows drew long, and what remained of the world turned away. Until midnight, all is turned away, silent and motionless. Awaiting the last tide.\nAnd with the tide, a new world unfurled.This review can also be found at Booknest"}, {"userName": "Markus", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26681101-markus", "userReview": "Here, then, is the tale. Between the swish of the tides, when giants knelt down and became mountains. When they fell scattered on the land like the ballast stones of the sky, yet could not hold fast against the rising dawn. Between the swish of the tides, we will speak of one such giant. Because the tale hides with his own.And because it amuses.\nThe fifth part of the Malazan Book of the Fallen is rather different from the previous four. Set on a faraway continent years before the stories of the Bridgeburners and the Whirlwind, the book tells another story. One of the Tiste Edur and their struggles, internal as well as external.Steven Erikson\u2019s writing has vastly improved since the series began. It was certainly more than adequate even in Gardens of the Moon, but at this point his style has become a joy to read. The combination of crude, militaristic, Glen Cook-style writing with more fascinatingly flowery elements is both unique and deeply enjoyable, and I found myself saving and highlighting quote after quote, often several on the same page.The most intriguing aspect of Midnight Tides is definitely its explanation and expansion of the Malazan lore. From the fantastic prologue onward, bits and pieces are added to the already quite astounding worldbuilding of Erikson and Esslemont. Here are the backstories, cultures and creation myths of various peoples new and old.\"You are ruled by greed, a monstrous tyrant lit gold with glory. It cannot be defeated, only annihilated.\"Another remarkably interesting and also somewhat controversial aspect of this book is the political symbolism. The rising Letherii Empire, with its raw capitalist society and its conquest and subjugation of other peoples in the name of freedom, is a rather obvious metaphor.\"The Dark Times had come with the rivening of the Tiste Edur, the assault of sorceries and strange armies and the disappearence of Father Shadow himself. And although the magic of Kurald Emurlahn was not denied to the tribes, the warren was lost to them: shattered, the fragments ruled by false kings and gods.\"Even more intriguing is the culture of the Tiste Edur. Midnight Tides arrives with virtually the entire history of this people. Its culture, its deities, its heroes and its empires.It is no secret that the Malazan series is difficult to read; if you believe otherwise, you\u2019re indulging in a self-deception that will come back to bite you as you progress with your reading. Because of that, this book is really helpful and makes you feel like you really get a grip on the setting and everything that\u2019s going on.Overall, Midnight Tides without a flicker of doubt the single book in this series that has impressed me the most. It does not contain any truly iconic heroes like the ones from the other books, but it is in my personal opinion vastly superior in both writing and worldbuilding. Not to mention that it was much easier to get truly immersed in the occurring events and actually experience them through the eyes of the central characters.If I did not love the Malazan universe before, this book has changed that.\"That which was chained to the earth has twisted the walls of its prison. Beyond recognition. Its poison has spread out and infected the world and all who dwell upon it.\u201d\nMalazan Book of the Fallen reviews:\n#1 Gardens of the Moon#2 Deadhouse Gates#3 Memories of Ice#4 House of Chains#5 Midnight Tides#6 The Bonehunters"}, {"userName": "Scott  Hitchcock", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50894754-scott-hitchcock", "userReview": "I'm halfway through the main series! Oh shit I only have half the main series left!It never ceases to amaze me how when I reflect upon an amazing section of the book how Erikson makes rocks, sand, dead bones, smashed pottery, detritus....... seem so utterly cool, epic, world shaping......Nobody writes a prologue in the epic and portentous way that he does and this may be the best of the lot. Simply amazing imagery, banter and hidden message set to unfold. I've often heard people say different books read better in the re-read of Malazan. Though the first four I never really felt it. In this book the first 8.5 chapters show how much Erikson has grown as a writer. At the same time for the first time in the series I was somewhat lost. I kept thinking that description is amazing and I have no clue what half of it it pointing towards. I have to believe in the re-read I would see so many gems I missed. From chapter 9 on, and chapter 9 has to be one of the top 5 of the series, it was simply amazing with everything clicking. I kept theorizing though out the book and thought I had things figured out and the last two chapters had me figuring little out and being so pleasantly surprised. Erikson more than any other book to date in the series take on the modern state of the world attacking greed, war, government and the general lack of compassion. It was a massive quote-fest. To balance this there was a lot more of the humor of the Bauchelain and Korbal Broach series interwoven. You had to be careful because one of these little macabre banter sessions would suddenly drop a series altering bomb in the middle of it. This is right up there with DHG and MOI after a somewhat, although still great, disappointing HOC."}, {"userName": "Jody ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41767362-jody", "userReview": "\u201cHe saw the tides in their immutable susurration, the vast swish like blood from the cold heart moon, a beat of time measured and therefore measurable. Tides one could not hope to hold back.\u201d\nIn Midnight Tides, Erikson has again introduced us to a new continent and cultures that continue to grow the ever expanding universe of the Malazan Book of the Fallen. There is an entire new dramatis personae save the exception of one character from House of Chains. Also, the setting of this book is before the events of Gardens of the Moon. I was slightly confused at the beginning until I figured this out. So, just a forewarning for all you future readers of this book. Having said all that, this was a great addition to the story as a whole. Erikson\u2019s style and imagination with each book really puts him in a league of his own when it comes to fantasy. To throw in a new storyline and new characters after 4 books is just unthinkable, and he seems to do it with such ease. Can\u2019t wait to see how this ties into the main story. I have my own assumptions, but I will leave them to myself at this point. The continent of Lether is occupied by two main societies. The Kingdom of Lether in the south and the Tiste Edur in the north. The two have managed to co-exist for centuries, but unfolding events will put that long lasted peace to the test. They both have their own internal struggles and problems, but it is the characters at the center of this that our story is focused around. Along with a certain outside diabolical force. \n\u201cThe tyrant was clothed in gold, and the future smelled of blood.\u201d\nI love the way Erikson portrays his characters with so many different dimensions to their personalities. This book is no different of course, and I have my favorites from each book. In Midnight Tides there were several story arcs that I enjoyed, but none of them can top Tehol and Bugg. This comedic duo rank among my favorites in this entire series. Tehol\u2019s wit and Bugg\u2019s undying devotion mixed with their crazy conversations was comedic entertainment at its best. There are specific scenes at a whorehouse and the Rat Catcher\u2019s Guild that will stick with me for a long time. Looking forward to seeing more of these two in future books. Here is quote from Bugg I though was cool, but only those who have read the books will understand and get the dark humor. \n\u201cGood things came from being nice to a Jaghut, something the T\u2019lan Imass never understood.\u201d \u2013 Bugg\nMidnight Tides was a nice change of pace from previous books. I love them all, and I am used to Erikson flipping the switch with each book, but this installment had a different feel to it. It almost felt like a standalone or first book in series if not for a few key factors. This is a tribute to just how vast this series is and how Erikson breaks the mold of the traditional fantasy genre. From the prologue to the last page this was one of my favorites so far. It has taken me 3 months to finish the fifth book and midway point of this series. I have enjoyed every coffee filled late night and put off responsibility to read this awesome book filled minute. I\u2019m not even going to recommend these anymore. You peeps know what to do! Enjoy!!!\n\u201cThe world has drawn breath\u2026..and now breathes once more.

I definitely won't put any big spoilers in it.Don't let the amount of time it took me to finish this book fool you: this is yet another amazing installment in the Malazan series. Up to this book, we've been introduced to a enormous cast of characters. And this book adds a completely new cast of characters, Trull Sengar is the only familiar face we see. Some may be turned off by this, but you quickly get used to it and everyone becomes as well known as the previous cast. I think I didn't mind this due to how much I loved so many of these characters. You can really tell that Erickson is honing his craft more and more with each new book. He continues to excel in his ability to give us some great characters. You really love the characters he meant for us to love, and hate the ones you're supposed to hate. Although, I still felt a pang of sympathy for one of the characters that we're meant to hate. There really wasn't that many battle scenes, but the ones we did get were so well executed. I can't think of any author who writes more brutal battle scenes without it feeling like he's going over the top. The characters I came to love most were definitely Tehol and Bugg. Their comic relief and witty banter were thoroughly enjoyable. I found myself actually laughing out loud at quite a few of their scenes, and if I wasn't laughing, I had a huge grin on my face. Besides that, I think Bugg is one of the most intriguing characters yet. You can really tell that we're not getting all the info on Bugg, that we're being kept out of the loop on something. Without giving anything away, I think we're going to see some amazing scenes come from future Bugg. The Sengar family had a pretty interesting story arc as well. There's not really much I can say about them without going into spoiler territory. But it was pretty fun to see the split in the family regarding one of the big conflicts in this story. I thought we were going to get to see what made the events transpire in the prologue of House of Chains, so I was pretty disappointed when the ending didn't lead into that. I imagine we'll see that soon enough, though. I think we can infer why HoC's prologue happens, but I was hoping to see the real reason. The Letherii side of the story had so many interesting characters, as well. Obviously Tehol and Bugg, but also people like Ublala Pung, Kettle, Shurq Elalle, and one of my newest favorites, Iron Bars. All-in-all, yet another amazing installment in the Malazan series.

But I was so wrong, I loved it, I must admit it was hard to get into, not as hard as GoTM but still hard. I can totally see the connection between this book and the previous in the series, can\u2019t wait for when they all meet. Like all books in this series, this book has a good dose of friendship, amazing battle scenes, malazan kind of romance that is usually tragic, diversity, family etc, there is basically nothing missing in this book.\n'Civilization after civilization, it is the same. The world falls to tyranny with a whisper. The frightened are ever keen to bow to a perceived necessity, in the belief that necessity forces conformity, and conformity a certain stability.\nBefore starting this book it is important to note this two things, it took me awhile to know what they were.1.\tThese is Trull Sengar\u2019s story, these invents happened before HoC, they are also other POVs that helped made the story more understandable. So yes the Crippled god have being interfering long before most people realized.2.\tThe Hold, this was mentioned basically almost throughout the book, I thought it meant the Deck of Dragons but no its not. The Hold of Tiles is an older version of the Deck of Dragons that Elder gods uses.World building and WritingSteven Erickson still manages to improve in his already perfect world building, there is so much improvement between this and the previous books, same goes for the writing, no longer a million POVs but a few that is comprehensible and tell the story well. I only wish the dialogue was more than the internal monologue.\nThe new plaster isn't showing any cracks. The owners are delighted\u2014''I thought I owned those warehouses.''Aren't you delighted?''Well, you're right, I am. Every one of me.'\nCharactersMy favourite part of the book, I love a good character driven books, especially when its well written and depicted. Two major races are the focus of this book. The Tiste Edur and the Letherii.The Tiste EdurThe Sengar brothers which include my personal favourite Trull Sengar the only known character, Udinaas, their Letherii slave, Mayen, Hanan Mosag and a host of others.Trull Sengar\u2019s story is even sadder than I anticipated, he is such a great man, kind, humble, honourable etc, he is never afraid to voice his opinions and doubts, despite the repercussions, and that was what lead to him being shorned by his people. I wish he was the eldest of the four brothers, things would have gone better for them, but no he is the second out of four sons.Fear Sengar is the first son, I seriously have no idea what to make of him at first, the guy has almost no facial expressions, he is the definition of impassive, ever the perfect warrior, how I wish he listens to Trull instead of shutting him up. When he finally starting questioning things it was almost too late, I hope its not too late.Binadas Sengar is the third Sengar brother, also the only sorcerer among them, the guy is so sceptical and invasive that I still don\u2019t know what to make of him.Rhulad Sengar the fourth and last son, I neither love nor hate him, I just pity him. He is not exactly a good guy but he doesn\u2019t deserve what is happening to him, no one does, hope his brothers will find a solution.Udinaas is a slave at the Sengar household, I really felt for him, everyone was just using him, not only mortals but other worldly creatures, I hope things gets better for him, he deserves more.The LetheriiWhich include the Beddict brothers, Seren Pedac, Shurq Elalle, Kettle,Bugg, Ublala Pung, Shand, Rissari, Hesun and others.Tehol Beddict is the second and middle son among the Beddict brothers. The guy is a mystery, he walks around with bedsheet tied around his waist or a woollen trousers of grey and yellow colour, not to mention he sleeps on his roof. Tehol is also a genius, even the Queen despise him because of something he did in the past, he is not a fighter, am pretty sure he doesn\u2019t know how to use a sword, he is also kind and honourable. His relationship with Bugg his manservant is one of my favourite things in this book.\nEven genius has its flaws.'Another grin. 'Even with you, Tehol?''Well, I was generalizing to put you at ease. I never include myself in my own generalizations. I am ever the exception to the rule.''And how do you manage that?''Well, I define the rules, of course. That's my particular game, brother.'\nBrys Beddict the third Beddict brother is presently the king\u2019s champion, like his brother Tehol he is also honourable, but a much better swordsman.Hull Beddict, the eldest of the three, he didn\u2019t have a POV, so it was hard to know what goes on in his head, from what people said about him, he seems like a good man.Seren Pedac is a Aquitor, some kind of guide and travel agent, she guides people that goes to the Edur land. I love her, she isn\u2019t exactly badass but she can hold herself in a fight, she is also feminine.Shurq Elalle is the opposite of Seren, she is an undead thief, even though she is undead she still steals, its quite ironic, she has very crazy friends, some undead like her others not so much.\n'I want to be scary. It's important that I be scary. I've been practising hissing and snarling.''No need for concern there,' Bugg replied. 'You'll be truly terrifying.'If I eat human flesh,' Harlest said, 'it will rot in my stomach, won't it? That means I will stink. I like that. I like thinking about things like that. The smell of doom.'\nSilchas Ruin is an ascendent and soletaken who is Anomander\u2019s younger brother, but unlike his brothers and race he is whit skinned due to his albinism."}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28602001-emma", "userReview": "I think the must be the third or fourth time i've read this book, but the first time i've ever taken the time to really read it. Previously, i'd approached it with little enthusiasm and more than a little petulance- why is this important? Why is it set before the first 4 books? Where are my favourite characters? Who cares about the Tiste Edur? A whole novel about Trull Sengar-are you serious? Thanks to this bad attitude, I skimmed the whole thing. I gave it 5 stars before because it's Erikson and no other reason. This time I give them freely, with full confidence and sincerity. I READ the book. And after the first few chapters of Trull whining, it was worth the effort. This instalment is Erikson doing political intrigue up close and personal. Of course, high politics underlies the entirety of the series, but the focus on the common man evens it out. Here, we get the power politics and economics of two clashing forces in direct opposition. It's done so very well through the two trio of brothers Sengar and Beddict. And this is where the new favourite characters come in: Tehol and Bugg. Love them or hate them, they lift intrigue to a different (rooftop) level. Not only that, i'd always passed over the Crimson Guard. I didn't even remember they were in this book. I defy anyone not to properly laugh out loud at Iron Bars' commentary. I'd love to quote it but it's too spoilery, those who've read it will already know anyway and those yet to read will know when they get there.

They are the repositories of poison. Their interest in you extends only so far as their ability to control you. From you, they seek duty and obedience, and they will ply you with the language of stirring faith. They seek followers, and woe to those who question, or voice challenge. \u2018Civilization after civilization, it is the same. The world falls to tyranny with a whisper.

In a world shaped into conformity, dissidents stand out, are easily branded and dealt with. There is no multitude of perspectives, no dialogue. The victim assumes the face of the tyrant, self-righteous and intransigent, and wars breed like vermin. And people die.\u201d...\nAmen!!! In the end of the previous book, the Tiste Edur Trull Sengar decided to tell his story to his undead companion. This book is that story. Midnight Tides connected with me on an intellectual level much more than the previous couple of tomes. I had a visceral emotional reaction to \"The Chain of Dogs\", which was book 2, I really enjoyed the other three books, but this one spoke to my current state of disillusionment with the world around me very cerebrally. We would like to be able to compare the fictional and fantastical empires of Malazan and Lethar to long dead empires of ours, but Lethar's problems were very closely related to our Western powers of today. The systematic destruction of the middle class with the growth of both groups of the very rich and the very poor, is becoming the perfect growing field for all that the majority of us find deplorable and unthinkable, but it starts insidiously creeping up on civilization and it cyclically destroys it from within... Rich and poor with no vast middle class for stabilization, is a revolution waiting to happen. And we once again never learn from history's lessons.... But the best way to make the point of this book I will let my very favorite character of the whole Malazan series up to now, Tehol Beddict, lay it out the way only he could!!! :\n\"... \u201cAs they walked, Tehol spoke. \u2018\u2026the assumption is the foundation stone of Letherii society, perhaps all societies the world over. The notion of inequity, my friends. For from inequity derives the concept of value, whether measured by money or the countless other means of gauging human worth. Simply put, there resides in all of us the unchallenged belief that the poor and the starving are in some way deserving of their fate. In other words, there will always be poor people. A truism to grant structure to the continual task of comparison, the establishment through observation of not our mutual similarities, but our essential differences. \u2018I know what you\u2019re thinking, to which I have no choice but to challenge you both. Like this. Imagine walking down this street, doling out coins by the thousands. Until everyone here is in possession of vast wealth. A solution? No, you say, because among these suddenly rich folk there will be perhaps a majority who will prove wasteful, profligate and foolish, and before long they will be poor once again. Besides, if wealth were distributed in such a fashion, the coins themselves would lose all value\u2014they would cease being useful. And without such utility, the entire social structure we love so dearly would collapse. \u2018Ah, but to that I say, so what? There are other ways of measuring self-worth. To which you both heatedly reply: with no value applicable to labor, all sense of worth vanishes! And in answer to that I simply smile and shake my head. Labor and its product become the negotiable commodities. But wait, you object, then value sneaks in after all! Because a man who makes bricks cannot be equated with, say, a man who paints portraits. Material is inherently value-laden, on the basis of our need to assert comparison\u2014but ah, was I not challenging the very assumption that one must proceed with such intricate structures of value? \u2018And so you ask, what\u2019s your point, Tehol? To which I reply with a shrug. Did I say my discourse was a valuable means of using this time? I did not. No, you assumed it was. Thus proving my point!\u2019 ... \"\nIf the Malazan Empire is the mirror of The Roman, then the Letherii society mirrors the Byzantine Empire in its most decadent. Rome and its military structure, together with their laws, engineering, and religious Pantheon, were a power which conquered, took everything, but also propped-up the peoples it enfolded into their empire. There were taxes in money and people, but overall, they worked under a set of rules which were pretty reasonable (this is speaking as a person of today, I am not sure the people at the time perceived it the same). Byzantium drowned under the wight of its arrogance and greed. Their sense of \"destiny\" and belief in supremacy made them entitled and incapable of correct objectivity when it came to their military power, their enemies and the internal decay that was eroding the core of their culture. It is sad, because they had gone complaisant, soft and fat, but the arts, literature, music and intellectual culture were flourishing. It would take centuries for them to reach the same levels, until which humanity in that region had lost most of its soul... \n\"... \u201cProgress... is the belief from which emerge notions of destiny. The Letherii believe in destiny - their own. They are deserving of all things, born of their avowed virtues... Destiny wounds us all and we Letherii wear the scars with pride... We have a talent for disguising greed under a cloak of freedom. As for past acts of depravity, we prefer to ignore those. Progress, after all, means to look ever forward, and whatever we have trampled in our wake is best forgotten\u2019 ... \"\nEverything in Lether exists only as far as its value goes. Gold can see a person and his family live well, or the lack of it can turn a family for generations to come into \"indebted\" = slaves. The ruling King, his Queen and their child, the Prince, are secure in the military and magical power of their kingdom, and see themselves as the fated rebirth of the foretold Lether Emperor and kin. The ruling class and the army leaders are so sure in their military prowess, that they start wars in order to gain more slaves and ultimately gold, with not a care for the people they conqueror. The poor are just a fother for the front-lines, to absorb the losses and perform the clean-up and manual labor. They are just throw-away lives, not real... Unless you are that poor person or their family... Udinaas is one of those indebted, who has been captured by the Edur and is a slave to them at the moment. Even as slaves, the Letherii continue segregating among themselves according to their status before being captured... \n\"... \u201cUdinaas well understood his own kind. To the Letherii, gold was all that mattered. Gold and its possession defined their entire world. Power, status, self-worth and respect\u2014all were commodities that could be purchased by coin. Indeed, debt bound the entire kingdom, defining every relationship, the motivation casting the shadow of every act, every decision.\u2019 ... \"\nThe Tiste Edur tribes live in the shadows of legends which paint them as the victims of betrayal, while denying them the greatness they see themselves as deserving. However, the distinct and warring Tiste Edur tribes have now united under the Warlock King and are preparing to claim their destiny at the head of the Letherii Empire. Theirs is a tribal culture where coins have value only as decoration of the body of the fallen warriors. They have trade and slaves from the people they conquer, seeing no point in gold as a commodity. Being barbaric in the eyes of Lether, they are vastly underestimated and the inevitable clash, which the Letherii provoke, is bound to be much more contested than the refined and arrogant royals and army expect. After all, the Warlock King has made some very powerful and angry new allies...So, we have very traditional clashes of cultures, but the book is much more than just that. It is layer upon layer of stories, human fates, political intrigues, economic plots for collapse of the money market, and most of all, we have the various g-ds starting to really show their hand in manipulating the pawns of their choosing. Old, Elder, New, not-completely ascended and forgotten G-DS are starting to steer and the hapless humans, as well as other races and creatures, they use and abuse, in most cases are left bereft of a choice or having say in any of their participation on the game board of the all-powerful. Some of those G-DS arose some sympathy in me, but most of them are petty and selfish, and I wanted to smack or destroy them, if possible both! However, the mortals, or mostly mortals, we get to meet in this book for the first time, were endlessly entertaining, however pathetic, non-to-bright, undead, powerful or genius they might have been. On the Edur side I was very partial to Trull Sengar, whom we met in House of Chains. However, both of his brothers were very memorable, each in their own way, as well. On the Lether side, well, the list is longer, but I am completely in love with Tehol Beddict, the middle of another three brothers, who lives as a failed destitute businessman, with his faithful man-servant Bugg, who is much more than he appears. His philosophical musings made this book a pleasure for me to read. Seren Pedac was also interesting, although her path is very difficult to read about... Great characters who delivered comic relief are the undead Shurq Elalle and her amazing makeover, the three ladies business partners of Tehol, their bodyguard, the complete opposite of Karsa in everything but physical appearance, Ublala Pung, and all the members of the Rat Catcher Guild!!!! I was particularly partial to every moment the Guild's \"inspector\" was on page:):):):) This multitude of the character ensemble made the massive book fun to read and easy to follow. The story was very linear and flowed in a manner not typical for the previous books. However, it was paced perfectly and I was very, very pleased with it. As always, I would highly recommend this series to all those who love Epic and Military Fantasy and do not expect romance or rainbows to come with it. The author once again shows the ugly face of war and the crime that it perpetuates on the individual as well as humanity as a whole. Brilliant!!! \n\"... \u2018Destiny is a lie. Destiny is justification for atrocity. It is the means by which murderers armour themselves against reprimand. It is a word intended to stand in place of ethics, denying all moral context.\u2019 ... \"\nNow I wish you All Happy reading and may you always find what you need in the pages of a Good Book!!!"}, {"userName": "David Sven", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8802423-david-sven", "userReview": "New Continent, new characters, and again a completely new and superior experience on the reread.

We also get a close up view of the forerunner magic system to the warrens \u2013 The Tiles and the Holds.I remember the first time I read this being put out because none of my favourite characters in the series so far were featured. Not only was I cut off from my favourite characters but it seemed I was in a whole new alternate universe to the one I had grown used to. Which makes sense because part of the premise of the story is that the continent of Lether has been isolated and quarantined from the rest of the world, and even from the warren system of magic. This time round it was fun revisiting some of my favourite characters in the series, like Tehol and Bugg, Shurq Ellale and Ublala Pung. The Crimson Guard also feature in the story.Instead of repeating most of what I have already said in my reviews of the previous four books I thought I would have some fun with a few snap shots of life in Letheras.***************************************************************\nThe Letheras Times\nWorld News \u2013 Tiste Edur negotiations collapse as god emperor rises. War ImminentThe Letherii delegation to the Edur led by Crown Prince Quillas was left perplexed as they were witness to a change in Edur leadership brought about by the resurrection of a new king who had recently died in battle. The delegation had hoped to sue the Edur for compensation for the loss of hundreds of harvested seal carcasses that the Edur had confiscated from Letherii ships. The fact that the carcasses were harvested illegally and therefore technically stolen from the Edur was outweighed by the technicality of the harvest still requiring hundreds of man hours to accomplish and therefore requiring compensation. The surrendering of control of Edur fishing grounds was suggested by the Letherii delegation.Things were reported to be going well before the negotiations were abruptly ended by the overthrow of the Edur king AKA The Warlock King, by a resurrected demon covered in Letherii gold coins.The Commander of the Letherii army fronted a press conference earlier today assuring the people of Lether that both the military and the Ceda were mobilising for a tactical response. \u201cWe have the army and we have the mages, and we will teach the Edur the meaning of \u2018Shock and Awe\u201d when we rain down the magic of the Empty Hold down upon their villages and enslave their children and their children\u2019s children to the tenth generation, for the glory of Lether.\u201d********************************************************************Finance News \u2013 Shares in Bugg Constructions up 4000 percent \u2013 Technical analysts say company is oversoldThings are on the up and up for recently floated construction company \u201cBugg Constructions.\u201d Bugg Constructions share price rocketed in the Tolls after the fledgling company acquired the contract for shoring up the \u201cEternal Domicile.\u201d Excavations and restoration of the ancient palace had been having trouble with flooding with no solution in sight, threatening to delay the advent of the prophesied \u201cSeventh Closure\u201d when our glorious King Ezgara Diskanar will ascend to take his rightful place on the Empty Throne of the Empty Hold to become the promised god Emperor.Bugg\u2019s Construction demonstrated a secret method of being able to solve the flooding crisis and monies to be received from the works and an ongoing maintenance contract have sent the revenue projections through the roof.

The usual structure of the book is the following: 5 pager worth of philosophical inner thoughts of a character following by 1 page of some action; I do not mean kick-the-crap-out-of-everybody action, just the acts of doing something, like mending a net. By my estimate, the book can be shortened by at least 2/3 by cutting on inner thoughts of secondary characters.No matter what the author says, this is not a part of the series, this is a standalone book. Only one character from this book appears in the earlier books (House of Chains to be exact). I failed to make any emotional connection with him even after finishing this book despite the fact that this was supposed to be his tragic life story. From looking into the list of characters of the next book, I see that only 3 of them (including the original guy) make it from this one; definitely not enough to warrant 700+ page book. New races, new places, even the magic system is different; so what exactly makes this book a part of Malazan series?Speaking of being able to connect to characters, I found I could only relate to one of them, and he does not get a lot of screen time (Iron Bars). A lot of people love Tehol, but I found him to be pointless to the story and not very believable. The book has strong anti-capitalistic undertones. I am not exactly the biggest fan of capitalism, but I really hate then something keeps hammering the message over and over; this is exactly what this book does. I got it already, please stop!The plot: two races want to start a war with each other. It is not clear what kept them from doing this earlier as there is no love lost between them, plus they want resources of their enemies. So this whole book is basically preparations for the war by these nations, or rather a lot of philosophical ramblings interrupted by the preparations. The actual war takes place in the last two chapters. 2.5 stars; I really hate giving this rating to the series I really like, but this book made me take a break from reading not just the series, but fantasy genre in general."}, {"userName": "Gavin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8192509-gavin", "userReview": "This was another fantastic instalment in the Malazan series. I think it stands alongside House of Chains and Gardens of the Moon in terms of quality and perhaps only behind Memories of Ice as my favourite in the series. Erikson's stories can sometimes get a bit to grim and bleak for my liking, but I thought this one found the perfect balance. We had betrayal, tragedy, evil characters, and pain and suffering aplenty, but we also got likeable characters, friendship and loyalty, humour, and some kick-ass moments of noble deeds. Story wise we had some big changes in this one. A new continent, new problems, and only a handful of familiar characters. The action took place on the continent of Lether and focused on the impending clash between the Tiste Edur tribes and the kingdom of Lether. Neither culture was one to admire but Erikson succeed in making me interested in the conflict and in making my sympathize with a number of characters on each side. The kingdom of Lethar embodied all the worst elements of a modern capitalist society. The Edur reflected the evils of a society driven by the certainties of religion and nationalism. Erikson put the boot into both hard and often. Not done there he also managed to use the ensuing epic battles between the nations to decry the horrors of modern warfare. I can see why Erikson's musings may have upset some readers since they were not exactly subtle, but since I happen to agree with him they were not an issue for me. Which brings me to a personal favourite moment. A chat between Tehol and Bugg where Bugg is railing about the problems of the Letharii way of governance. Tehol asks Bugg how it could be done better and Bugg basically just tells him he has no idea and that human nature is what it is so it likely will always have issues with greed and corruption. A bleak view for sure, but another I find myself agreeing with. As with all Malazan books we got a mix of mortals and gods. We got to learn more of the Tiste Edur and the Tiste Andii and their entrance into this realm so long ago and we got to meet a bunch of their awesome Gods. Silchas Ruin, brother of Anomander Rake was the most notable, but we met plenty of others as well. We got another glimpse of the Crippled God and saw him setting a few of his plans into action. Then we had everything from Jaghut, Forkrul Assail, and demons, to Toblaki and Soletaken Gods making an appearance. We meet a host of great new characters. Most of the story revolved around the fates on the four Tiste Edur Sengar brothers and the three Letharii Beddict brothers. Erikson did a great job with both families. We had characters to love and despise and others who were deserving of a bit of both of those feelings. I was pretty happy with the story arcs for the all of them. The brothers aside we met a bunch of fun new characters like Iron Bars and Corlo from the famed Crimson Guard( I want more of them soon ), the hilarious and likeable undead trio of Shurq Elalle, Kettle, and Harlast( I hope we definitely see the female pair again ), The half Tarthanal Ublala Pung( So unlike Karsa!), Seren Pedac( I did not love her, but I suspect her future will make for interesting reading), and the Letharii slave Udinaas( a hard character to figure out but I found myself mostly sympathizing with the guy). I've likely forgot a few, but that is the way of things when you have such a large and interesting cast! I found the pacing of the story to be very good and I was totally caught up in the engaging tale. I was dreading the ending, but Erikson pulled off a satisfactory one in the midst of another epic and exciting convergence.I cannot wait to read what happens next. Things bode well for the Bonehunters being an awesome read.Rating: 5 stars.Audio Note: Micheal Page did an excellent job with the narration of Midnight Tides. It helped that the cast was completely different so the inconsistencies between Page and Lister character interpretations was a non-issue."}, {"userName": "Stefan Bach", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24053713-stefan-bach", "userReview": "\"There is a tide in the affairs of men and we, at the height, are ready to decline.\"\n\nWhile I'm of an opinion that \nMemories of Ice\n is his best \nMalazan\n novel, \nMidnight Tides,\n with its criticism on materialism and slavery - which in mirroring history (and to a major degree present time) of our own society leaves a sour taste - is probably my favorite book of the series.Before I could continue with book four, \nHouse of Chains,\n I had to read Midnight Tides, which is fifth installment in \nMalazan Book of the Fallen\n series. By doing so, I got introduced myself with all the characters that were active at the same time when story of the first three books happened.It actually makes more sense to read it this way, to switch order of these two books, because now I have a clear path for the story to move forward.So yes, it\u2019s three books of constant introductions of new settings, stories, characters, their histories and philosophies. It\u2019s definitely an expansion and form of exploration of my own.So let\u2019s see in which corner of Malazan Earth this book takes us.After introducing ourselves with the continents of \nMalazan Empire, Genabackis\n and \nSeven Cities,\n we are traveling again to a completely new continent (one of seven in this world), a continent called \nLether.\n Link to magnifyLink to magnifyAnd it\u2019s really interesting how people and their nations stayed secluded from the rest of the world and within their own borders. Well, everyone except Kingdom of Lether.\n\nStory.\n\nIn its expansion Kingdom of Lether conquered almost all of their bordering nations and now it\u2019s the time to conquer their northern neighbors, not so peaceful \nTiste Edur\n tribes.And the ploy for doing that is quite specific.But first we have to understand how Letherii society works.In structure of Letherii society, one can argue, is Erikson\u2019s most plain and obvious criticism of our own history and that still very heavy weight of colonialism and imperialism we are carrying; all while it\u2019s mirroring the contemporary world\u2019s struggle with flaws of capitalism, such as social inequity, exploitation, corruption and greed. \n\u201cThe Letherii motive was, is and shall ever be but one thing. Wealth. Conquest as opportunity.Opportunity as invitation. Invitation as rightful claim. Righteous claim as preordained, as destiny.Destiny as victory, victory as conquest, conquest as wealth. But nowhere in that perfect scheme will you find notion of defeat. All failures are temporary, flawed in particular. Correct the particular and victory will be won the next time around.\u201d\nThe Letherii society worships wealth. Stacking coins on top of coins \u2013 for the sake of stacking coins on top of coins and manic accumulation of that wealth \u2013 their true religion. The lack of compassion is being justified by the need to be realistic.Their indebted form of slavery where one\u2019s entire family for generations gets to repay a debt, is bathing in extremity of their judgements. And the fact how they are imposing this to all of their bordering nations is deeply rooted belief of self-righteousness.Life is a contest to be won or lost.Death as arbiter of meaning.And above else, judgement is a thing to be delivered, not delivered unto.\n\u201cOur headlong progress, as if motion was purpose and purpose inherently virtuous.\u201d\nTo the Letherii, gold is all that matters. Its possession defines their entire world.Power, status, self-worth and respect \u2013 all were the commodities that could be purchased by coin.Debt bounds the entire Kingdom, defining every relationship and every motivation, every act and decision - hides behind this.So, for such nation of belief of grandeur, of predetermination, is completely acceptable that they can intrude foreign territory, to hunt and hoard riches of someone else\u2019s hard labor.And because of their self-righteousness it\u2019s only logical for them - when tribes from whom they have stolen from retaliates and destroys ships, kills the crew and gets back those riches stolen from them - to demand compensation. Not for the ships destroyed, not for the crew killed, but for the loss of the market value they would gain with riches they have stolen in the first place.Thus making yet another nation their indebted slave.But this time they are facing Tiste Edurs, who are on the road of self-righteous imperialism and colonization themselves.\n\nCharacters.\n\n\n\"Two sets of brothers.\"\nCore of this book are \nBedict\n brothers of Lether and \nSengar\n brothers of Tiste Edur, their relationship within each set and differences in their comparison.It's fascinating to me how dichotomy in which this book started - when we see three Letherii brothers who don't even hide how estranged they are from each other: \u2023 where eldest of them \nHull\n is on a mission of redemption and probable betrayal of his Kingdom;\u2023 \nTehol,\n who despite his genius spends his days penniless on the roof with his manservant \nBugg;\n\u2023 \nBrys,\n the youngest brother, who tries to uphold to his duty to his King and Kingdom of Lether for all three of Bedict brothers. While on the other side, within closeness of four Edur brothers, vastly different currents run beneath the surface:\u2023 where, the eldest, \nFear,\n struggles with his duty to his people, to his brothers, to his betroth;\u2023 \nBinadas,\n who runs from his loyalty;\u2023 \nTrull,\n who questions every decision;\u2023 and \nRhulad,\n the youngest one, who out of inexperience and ignorance can't comprehend the reality of the world - reversed throughout the book and changed its role within the sets.We still have that same dichotomy, but completely different relationships of the characters. \n\nSymbolism and Allegory.\n\nAfter three books heavily oriented on multiple hundreds of people battling each other in close combat in nothing but flesh and bone, with swords, spears and shields, it was a refreshment seeing deployment of magic in war and development of it. Such variety of different types of magic that irreversibly changes the evolution of warfare in this world. And even here you can see Erikson\u2019s criticism; this time on weapons of mass destruction. When unified tribes and self-proclaimed \nEmpire of Tiste Edur\n declares war on Kingdom of Lether, Lether King \nEzgara Diskanar\n tries to quickly end the war by ordering his mages to bomb with magic and obliterate all Tiste Edur villages. Under excuse of saving resources and lives of his own troops, which is undeniable truth, Kingdom of Lether saw nothing close to insane in committing genocide and mass murdering of hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians in most undignified way possible: from afar, safely secluded in their borders, dropping magic from the sky above.\n\u201cThis is not war. This is\u2026 what? I have no answer to describe the magnitude of this slaughter.It is mindless. Blasphemous. As if we have forgotten dignity. Theirs, our own. The word itself.No distinction between innocence and guilt, condemned by mere existence.People transformed against their will into nothing more than symbols and sketchy representations.\u201d\n\n\nProse.\n\nFollowing satirical humor from Memories of Ice, I believe of all books in the series, with addition of Letherii fop \nTehol Bedict\n and his manservant \nBugg,\n in this master/servant dichotomy, sarcasm is most prominent in this one here.And while maybe balance of humor and serious observation isn\u2019t as perfect as in \nMoI,\n most important thing is that it\u2019s quite enjoyable reading endless battles of wits, in beautifully written satire, between these characters, which again, provides much necessary break from all those mentioned above heavier references.\n~~~~~\nThis is a series where, in my opinion, with every next book Erikson excels even further. There\u2019s seemingly no ending to chasm-like depth of both his worldbuilding and characterization.And it\u2019s such a rewarding series where, after you were depraved of much needed explanations, you get to learn how this world works, but instead to learn such things with those same characters you were following so far in previous books, you get to see how that works on a completely different side of the globe. And when realization strikes and all those bits and pieces you were collecting so far click among themselves, you\u2019ll wish to get back and reread from the beginning.(Or you\u2019ll stick until the end and each year get back to reread from the beginning, like some of us here.)\n4.16/5\n\nKharkanas TrilogyForge of DarknessFall of LightPath to Ascendancy seriesDancer's LamentDeadhouse LandingMalazan Empire seriesNight Of KnivesMalazan Book of the Fallen seriesGardens of the MoonDeadhouse GatesMemories of IceUltimate Malazan Chronological Reading Order"}, {"userName": "Molly", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9077850-molly", "userReview": "[gods in disguise...\u201cYou are a man of many mysteries, Bugg.

He and his people the Tiste Edur have been united under the Warlock Kin. However, their time of peace is coming to an end as war with Lether, a kingdom who has already conquered several other peoples, looms.As always there are some pretty fascinating characters, such as Trull and his brother Fear, and their family servant Udinaas on the side of the Tiste Edur. We also meet some Letherii people, including Tehol Beddit and his manservant Bugg who provided much of the comic relief in this book, as well as his brothers Brys, Hull and various others.Typical Erikson style to give you POVs on both sides of the conflict, so you grow attached to characters that you know may not make it to the end of the book.

However, it makes it so worth it because each book in this series keeps getting better and better."}, {"userName": "Lee", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4162390-lee", "userReview": "Second time round the only thing that changed from my first read was that I enjoyed it even more! This is still my favourite of the series so far, yet I cannot wait for Bonehunters to start.Original review below.Story: 5/5\n1: Being Vague, rambling plot with no little believable storyline5: Ripping yarn, clever, thought provoking\nI must admit to starting this book with some reservation. I had just finished House of Chains and rated it 5 stars. You can read my review on that here I was completely \u2018into\u2019 the story and the characters of the Malazan world. So when I realised this story was going to be told on a completely different continent with all new characters at a time I was unsure of I was a little hesitant. But Erikson got me again. Another 5 stars. I thoroughly enjoyed the storyline, it was interesting, engaging and I really feel like I got to understand the relatively unknown race of the Tiste Edur. The two main story-lines are based on the Sengar family of Tiste Edur and the Beddicts. Each family has some very interesting characters and drawing the book to a close Erikson completes a thoroughly enjoyable read.Characters: 5/5\n1: Unrealistic/unbelievable. Feel nothing for these characters5: Fully engaged with the characters, believable. Researched.\nBrilliant character development. Powerful, emotional, weird, funny and believable. I had heard so much about Tehol and Bugg that to be honest I was not as impressed with them as I expected to be. Their humour at times became forced and its constant effort to be funny at times became boring. On the other hand the characters Udinaas and Rhulad develop a great relationship that is fully worth reading. Trull Sengar is a rock in this and you do begin to understand the man himself.Read Weight: Solid\nFluffy, Light, Solid, Heavy, Struggle\nSo normally Eriksons stuff is Heavy, but this being a standalone, with very little reference to other continents, races, too many gods and ascendents, or 100,000 other characters, it makes is a easier read than normal. Solid it is.Engagement: 4/5\n1: Not fussed about finishing5: Could stay up all night\nI couldn\u2019t wait to get on the train to read it again. I read it at breakfast, I read it at lunch, I even read it walking to the train, but that proved a little to dangerous.Recommend: 4/5\n1: Would advise you to read something else5: Go read it now. It is THAT good\nI would recommend this to any Epic fantasy lover, I think that if you hadn\u2019t read other Malazan books you could start with this and get a good understanding of Style of Erikson."}, {"userName": "ijeoma Agbaje", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16037420-ijeoma-agbaje", "userReview": "I honestly panicked when i started reading Book 5. In my mind, i was like, will this be THE Malazan book i officialy have no love for...?Will i ever understand what in the world is going on here? The answer is yes...now i understand why book 5 was more or less a standout book for fans of this novel, you're either going to love it or hate it. I've decided there's no middle ground for Malazan books lol.\n\n\nBetrayals, more betrayals than any mortal could bear -Feather Witch\n\nSo book 5 basically introduces us to new characters, new everything with only one familiar face. It's like you're back in book 1. For the most part, you're like what's happening? who are these people? Time frame wise, i'm thinking book 5 was before the time of Laseen's reign and during Kellanved's reign so basically everything in book 5 precedes Book 1 - I know Erikson loves to show off- \nCharacters:\n Erikson continues to wow us with more characters to love.. Did you think you could love just the bridge burners or Anomander Rake or Kruppe, Onrack, Icarium, Mappo, Coltaine, Uncle, Duiker, Karso Orlong etc etc etc and not have room for more? Nope, Erikson continues to show that he just wants to give you more characters to love and who he can break your heart with.\nPlot:\n this is a book that touches on themes of betrayal, vengeance, rise of new civilizations..We're introduced to another one of the Tiste race unlike the Andiis however the Edur's i feel are less in touch with who they really are. It's almost like the story of our favourite Toblakai. There's this re-occurring theme in the Malazan book that without strong knowledge of your history, you're susceptible to lies and being played by men and gods alike.All in all book 5 reads like a beginning of sorts, to new things and i for one i'm totally pumped to continue this journey."}, {"userName": "Chris Berko", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13125862-chris-berko", "userReview": "The last 200 hundred pages were more Shakespearean than anything Shakespeare ever wrote.

I think I might be dizzy from the abrupt turn about.This is a story of brothers or two sets of brothers so be more precise. Told mostly about the three Tiste Edur brothers Trull is the only character in this book that we have ever seen before. This is the tale of how he was cast out from his people and one of the first power plays made by the Crippled God. On the other side of an upcoming war are the three Beddict brothers. Most of the tale is told from Tehol Beddits perspective and is it an odd yet entertaining one. I found his shenanigans with his loyal servant Bugg to be the best parts of this book.While this book did give some great insight into the past of the Tiste Edur and hints of how things went terribly wrong for them to a point that in the current Malazan books they seem to be mostly killed off it really was my least favorite part of the book. For a few reasons one being that for awhile a lot of the Edur storyline was uncomfortable to read. Rhulad is the younger brother of Trull and Fear and he is so full of pride and envious of everything his brothers are or have. Rhulad flirts with the betrothed of his brother hoping to steal her away and believes himself to be the best warrior but he has never seen a battle. So when he ends up in charge of all of the Tiste Edur everything goes to hell in a handbasket and Trull is the only one to challenge the abomination that is Rhulad.Tehol\u2019s chapters are much lighter in tone and have a plethora of interesting characters. Bugg his faithful manservant that can make dinner out of just about anything was one of my favorites. Then there is a little corpse girl wandering around killing random people here and there and I loved her. \n \u2018Kettle, how many people have you killed in the past year?\u2019She cocked her head. \u2018I can\u2019t count past eight and two.\u2019 \u2018Ah.\u2019 \u2018Lots of eight and twos.\u2019\nJust remember to be her friend and you should be fine. I\u2019m not sure what Tehol\u2019s revenge on the city was going to be but it seemed like he was trying to take down the entire Lethori culture. It just so happened to end up coming to a head at the end when the Tiste Edur show up to fight the Lethori and something else is breaking free of it\u2019s chains all at the same time.There are some great characters in this and I was a little wowed to find out what/who Bugg is. But then at the same time at the end of this I had no idea why we have an entire book dedicated to the history of this world and wondered will we see many of the characters from this in future books because I believe there are millennia inbetween. I guess at this point in time I really didn\u2019t see a point to it.Still the storytelling is vast and intricate and I feel like I\u2019m only catching the tip of the iceberg and getting 10% of the story while there is another 90% going on underneath that I\u2019m totally missing. These books are truly dense and I must go slowly since it take complete concentration. There are many other same story lines going on at the same time with so many other characters that I really just can\u2019t comment on everything happening.I\u2019m excited to get back to the main storyline and see how anything from this book plays into the present day events. There are a few characters that I would really like to see again like Iron Hands, Bugg, Tehol, Udinaas and Feather Witch. And who knows in this series it is entirely possible that they show up again with a new name and a new agenda."}, {"userName": "Rob", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10743961-rob", "userReview": "Executive Summary: I'm surprised to be giving this book 4 stars. It started as a 2 for me. My enjoyment slowly built as the book when on, and in the end I enjoyed it overall.\nFull Review\nSo I gave this book 4 stars, which means I liked it, but I'm going to start off with a bit of a rant about this series that has been festering for the last 6 weeks or so as I've read this book.Steven Erikson writes some of the WORST beginnings to books I have ever read. And it's not because he can't write them. House of Chains shows that he can write a straightforward and comprehensible beginning, despite changing locations and introducing many new characters. I enjoyed that book all the way through.No book in the series so far has shown this fact more than this one. I was about ready to quit the book in frustration. He introduced what seemed like 20 new characters in the span of maybe 2 chapters. This book has all of one character in it from the previous 4 books. And he was a relatively minor character that I was pretty indifferent towards. None of it made much sense to me.I'm apparently not the typical Malazan fan in this. Everyone else seems to enjoy being thrown into the deep end at the start of each book. I don't. I'm pretty tired of it by now as my rant may indicate. I just don't get why all the hardcore Malazan fans do. I guess that means I'll never be one of them. Then again there are still 5 more books to go.I'm really enjoying this series so far, but Mr. Erikson seems to go out of his way to alienate potential fans in my opinion. I don't mind all the layering and complex foreshadowing he does. I certainly don't get even a third of it, but it doesn't bother me. It just makes me feel pretty dumb/unobservant in a group reading setting.OK, now that I got that off my chest. This book is sort of odd. The whole thing is a flash back. It's hard to say exactly when it occurs. It seems like the near past. I feel like this story might better have been told earlier in the series. Maybe it's beginning would have frustrated me less then, but probably not.There are some really great characters in this book though. They are largely responsible for my enjoyment of this book. Mr. Erikson seems to have this obsession with pairs of characters, and Tehol and Bugg are now only second to Quick Ben and Kalam as my favorites.Iron Bars is probably now one of my favorites as well. I wish we had gotten to see more of him in this book that we did. Hopefully we'll see more of him later in the series.This book is much less action-packed than the previous four. There is a lot more politics in this one. That doesn't make it any less gruesome and dark. Just like the rest of the series, there are some truly disturbing scenes in this book.As I got my feet about me again and got past the horrible beginning, I moved into a solid 3 territory. The ending of this was quite enjoyable, and the book became hard to put down. This bumped it to a 4 star by the end, which is saying a lot since I started at barely a 2.I can't wait to jump into The Bonehunters, especially since most of my favorite characters look to be back. Likely to die in some horrible fashion the way this series seems to be going, but I'll continue to read in morbid fascination."}, {"userName": "Miche", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42952572-miche", "userReview": "Erikson showed us again that he isn't afraid to take risks. He had this well established series and halfway through it, he decided to publish a book in which he only brought back one character from the hundreds we had already met.

My fear dissipated as soon as I read the best line opener I have ever read:\n\"From the twisting, smoke-filled clouds, blood rained down.\"\nFrom that point on, he had my full attention. Who cares if I only knew one character? With that opener, I knew great things were to come. Spectacular world building, epic battles, memorable characters.

I certainly couldn't have been more surprised to find out that I enjoyed this book so much I wrot multiple super-extra-really long messages in the goodreads group I host about it, and I filled up the character limit of goodreads multiple times... Yep, this was most definitely my favourite one so far and it's a solid 5* read.So, what did I enjoy so much about this book in comparison to the previous ones (although I gave Book 4 a 5* rating too)? Basically it was just wonderful through and through and nearly every character's storyline wove really well, it was more cohesive than previous books despite still a broad amount of characters. I read through it whilst working and it was over about 3 days of working that I really got through it so it was a book I managed to fully immerse myself in. I know all of the terminology by now so I was able to understand who was who and root for my favourite characters. There were a lot of wonderful new character introductions and we also see the return and expansion of a few others from the other books. There were some truly horrible, creepy and atmospheric scenes. There's some cool magic and godly interference. Basically what more could you want?!In this book we are following the Lether and the Edur, two quite different races who are seemingly on the brink of either peace or war when we join the story. The Edur are a non-human race of people who are very strict within their tribe about custom. Each member strives to become blooded and they have a pretty tight knit community thanks to a Warlock King who has managed to recently Unite the various tribes. They keep various Lether slaves with them to do the menial tasks such as embalming and general work, and they have a strong dislike for the Lether after they believe that the ;Lether have been illegally stealing from them.The Letherii on the other hand are the most prominent of the humans on the continent of Lether and they have gradually been conquering various lands and people and forcing them into their own ways of life and society. They are fairly standard in that Politics and fighting is a key part of their storyline, but it's the people who Steven Erikson chooses to focus on within the Letherii who make their side of the story great.We don't really know which side we should be rooting for as we can see that each side is certainly flawed in a variety of ways and that there's problems with the ways of life for each, but still Erikson makes you care for people on both sides and therein lies the problem of waiting for the possible death of one of your favourite characters or sides and never knowing who it may be (he's a devil of an author for tricks!!).Some of the characters who I most enjoyed reading about included:Bugg and Tehol - the wonderful duo within this book who not only have a witty and humorous relationship but also act quite silly at times (in a good way). They are fascinating together because they react so well to one another and they know the other so well that they know just how to handle everything between them. They were by far my favourite of the characters, and I have to say some of the scenes between them made me laugh aloud! Bugg was a fantastic manservant to Tehol who was realistically more like a wonderful friend, and Tehol is a man who's quite bizarre but hugely intelligent and is responsible for something [almost] very detrimental to the Letherii side (despite being a Letherii himself). Then we have Trull - an Edur who is our returning character from another book. We have met him before and therefore know some of his nature, but this tells us his backstory and explains how he came to be the character we already know him as. He's a very pensive and intelligent character and he faces a lot over the course of this book which might make another being crack under the pressure, but he holds true to what he believes and is not afraid to question the problems of their society.Udinaas and Feather Witch - have to come next as they are slaves for the Edur. They were a strange pairing straight from the get go as Udinaas seems to be settled in his life as a slave, and he seems fairly content. Feather Witch is (as he name suggests) a sort of Witch who can cast the Tiles (similar to The Deck of Dragons) and she's a rather snooty character at times. However it was more their storyline than anything else which really kept me intrigued and excited.Shurq and Kettle - two undead characters we meet, one a lady and one a young girl, are both very cool to read about. They each have their own ambitions, Shurq wanting to be pretty once more and Kettle wanting to help her friends, but both of these wishes are a little difficult to achieve and they become embroiled in the Lether side of things pretty fast.Finally we have Brys - the King's champion on the Lether side. He's actually the brother to Tehol and his storyline was the one which took me the longest to get invested in because it was quite politically heavy. However I did fine his character to be likeable, particularly as he had a strong love for his brothers and wanted always to try and protect them, despite them often putting him under a lot of stress and extreme circumstances.There are many many more character who I could mention, as there always are, but those are the ones who most stood out to me and were really interesting to read about (although there were a lot of other great ones too).In terms of the writing I feel like Erikson only continues to improve as he goes and I have such high hopes for the rest of the series now that I am fully invested in it. He can evoke such vivid moments with his characters that leave you feeling as though you were there, watching whatever marvel or horror he puts before you. He's also brilliant and bring up very thought-provoking topics such as economy (let me just say that this was done SO much better in this book as a focus than in The Dragon's Path by Daniel Abraham which just didn't work at all for me. Steven Erikson managed not only to keep my interest through the passages talking about money and the economy, but actually make me think about it myself), slavery etc in a very well considered way. Whist there are scenes of barbarism there's also moments of beauty.On the whole I am super excited to continue with book 6 in July (I'm planning on reading Night of Knives by Ian Esslemont in June) and I hope that the series stays strong. If you can get into this series it's a very rewarding one - 5*s!!"}, {"userName": "Neo Marshkga", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31271747-neo-marshkga", "userReview": "\"But for now, i\u00b4m going to beat a God senseless\"The fifth part of this saga has the peculiarity of having only ONE character from the previous books, the rest of them are ALL new, and, at the same time, it takes place in the past, before the events of the previous books. This is something weird in a saga like this, since by the fifth book, you should already know all the characters and have a little bit of knowledge of what is going on.... But yeah, that doesn't happen in Malazan, as this saga breaks a lot of rules in an intriguing and very elegant way.In this book we are presented with the Tiste Edur, well, not presented, they appeared on previous books, but we knew NOTHING about them, or why they where helping the Crippled God on Book 4.... well, here we have that backstory, presented in a magnificent way.This books has a GREAT plot, but the page-turners are the character\u00b4s, those are the ones that will make you want to read and keep reading, because, as you should all know, Erikson has the capacity to create incredible, flawed and lovable characters.This book, is one of the EASIEST to read in all the saga, even when we are thrown into an unknown land, with unknown character\u00b4s and unknown culture... which is weird, since this should be a though read normally on Erikson's books, but it is not the case.All the character's are great, really. But if i have to chose some of them, it would be Trull Sengar, Tehol and Bugg and Udinaas. Trull being the character you want to learn more about, since you know and like him already from House of Chains, Udinaas since he represents the rebellion against Capitalism gone wrong (Hahahahahahaha).... and obviously Tehol and Bugg because they are the comic relief but without being stupid, on the contrary, their discussions are very witty and incredible well written, and the plot's they plan are a work of art.I enjoyed a lot how they explain more about the Magic of this world, understanding the Holds, and the difference between those and the Warrens. More insight regarding the Azath and the Nameless Ones. Definitively a book that will be enjoyed by everyone who reads it.PD: Having read a little bit about the Crimson Guard and the Avowed, i am going to order the Malazan Empire books, cause something tells me i need to read those."}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7022024-mike", "userReview": "I often joke that every Malazan book starts with a completely new cast of characters. Well, clearly Steven Erikson heard back through the mists of time and decided to up his game to the next level: there is only ONE character from the previous books in this, the FIFTH installment of the series. Let me tell you, it takes some major cajones to try and pull that off. Of course, Erkison pulls this of brilliantly, giving us a whole slew of new cultures and characters to get immersed in.This book primarily concerns itself with a conflict between the Tiste Edur (who we were briefly introduced to in House of Chains) and a human civilization of Letheras. As always Erikson gives us some great cultures, both in terms of their qualities and their beliefs.\nWe are Edur. We were masters of the Hounds, once. We held the throne of Kurald Emurlahn. And would hold it still, if not for betrayal, first by the kin of Scabandari Bloodeye, then by the Tiste Andii who came with us to this world. We are a beset people...\"\nThey are a conservative civilization whose glory is far in their past but would seek to recover it under the leadership of a powerful warlock.Not that the Letherii are much better.\nUdinaas well understood his own kind. To the Letherii, gold was all that mattered. Gold and its possession defined their entire world. Power, status, self-worth and respect - all were commodities that could be purchases by coin. Indeed, debt bound the entire kingdom, defining every relationship, the motivation casting the shadow of every act, every decision.\n The vast majority of Letherii were indebted, effectively owned by a much wealthier citizen. Some were even born as indebted as debts passed through generations. But where the Edur are a conservative society where little changes, the Letherii are driven by a kind of manifest destiny to absorb all its neighbors and continually expand:\nThe Letherii motive was, is and shall ever be but one thing. Wealth, Conquest as opportunity. Opportunity as invitation. Invitation as righteous claim. Righteous claim as preordained, as destiny. Destiny as victory, victory as conquest, conquest as wealth. But nowhere in that perfect scheme will you find the notion of defeat. All failures are temporary, flawed in the particular. Correct the particular and victory will be won the next time round.\nThe clash of the two different cultures was very interesting to watch, especially as the war caused the respective cultures to question their underlying beliefs.Speaking of the war, Erikson once again does a smashing job bringing the sheer waste and destructive nature of war to the forefront. Often you will see battles in the fantasy genre glorify battles and wars where valor and nobility can turn the tide of an unwinnable fight. Erikson rightly recognizes the sheer power of magic on the battle field:\nSorcery was the weapon for the battle to come. Perhaps it was, in truth, the face of future wars the world over. Senseless annihilation, the obliteration of lives in numbers beyond counting. A logical extension of governments, kings and emperors. War as a clash of wills, a contest indifferent to its cost, seeking to discover who will blink first - and not caring either way.\nAll the courage, bravery, and training in the world cannot protect a soldier from a rolling wave of magical death. There is no glory in being ripped apart by forces beyond your control before you can engage the enemy. As William Tecumseh Sherman said: War is hell.On a more micro level there were so many great relationships and characters in this book it is tough to mention all of them. I think my favorite was between Bugg and Tehol. Tehol the seemingly eccentric and lazy former financial genius and his ever suffering manservant Bugg were endless sources of entertainment:\n\"Hold on, Bugg. Now I do have some pertinent questions.\"\"Your questions are always pertinent, master\"\"I know, but these are particularly pertinent.\"\"More so than usual?\"\"Are you suggesting that my normal pertinence is less than particular, Bugg?\"\"Of course not, master.\"~~\"Don't you want to eat first, Master?\"\"You scrounged something?\"\"No.\"\"So we have nothing to eat.\"\"That's right.\"\"Then why did you ask me if I wanted to eat?\"\"I was curious.\"~~\"You poked him in the eyes?\"\"I judged it useful in getting his attention.\"\"I'm pleased, although somewhat alarmed.\"\"The circumstances warranted extreme action on my part.\"\"Does that happen often?\"\"I'm afraid it does.\"\n Every time they showed up it was a joy to read. I put them up with Iskaral Pust and Kruppe in terms of sheer reading joy.Another very fascinating relationship was between Udinaas, a Letheri slave, and the Emperor of the Edur. The Emperor, for various regions that I won't spoil here, suffer immensely, both physically and mentally. Where other see him as Emperor or as their relationship with him before he took the mantle, Udinaas simply seems him as a creature that is suffering and deserves to be helped. They share a very special bond, not one of master and slave, but of care giver and sufferer. With all the climatic events that surround them, this simple relationship stays true and bittersweet. But as with all characters in this series, they are not immune to much greater forces influencing/coercing them into actions they regret. Of all the relationships I have come across in this series, this was the most poignant.\nYou, all the Edur, see the sword. Or the gold. You see... the power. The terrifying, brutal power. I see what it takes from him, what it costs [him]. I am Letherii, after all. I understand the notion of debt... I am his friend. that is all.\n I think what I found most interesting was Erikson's treatment of manifest destiny. Letherii culture was suffused with unbridled assurance that their way was the right way and victory was a forgone conclusion.\nThe Letherii way of life was hard, but it was the true way, the way of civilization. The proof was found in its thriving where other ways stumbled or remained weak and stilted.\nLetherii characters, at least those in leadership positions, we remarkably arrogant. In leading up to the war with the Triste Edur, they brazenly believed all their plans would play out exactly as they intended, that there was no way their enemies could come up with surprises, and if they did the flexible Letherii would adapt and crush them. There was no sense that failure could ever befall them.\nProgress... is the belief from which emerge notions of destiny. The Letherii believe in destiny - their own. They are deserving of all things, born of their avowed virtues... Destiny wounds us all and we Letherii wear the scars with pride... We have a talent for disguising greed under a cloak of freedom. As for past acts of depravity, we prefer to ignore those. Progress, after all, means to look ever forward, and whatever we have trampled in our wake is best forgotten\nOnce again, terrible society, but expertly crafted and realized.I was totally absorbed by the inevitable clash, both with the big strategic picture and the trials and tribulations the war puts its characters through. The stress of challenged beliefs and notions was well presented and really humanized Erikson's characters. Once again I am impressed by Erikson's ability to make me care about the fate of characters I have never been introduced to before. I certainly skipped over a lot of other awesome parts of this book in this review, but I will leave that up to others to expound upon. This was an excellent addition to the series and sets up a lot of really need possibilities.And, as always, some of my favorite quotes:Architecture is serious business: The dome had proved so challenging to the royal architects that four of them had committed suicide in the course of its construction, and one had died tragically - if somewhat mysteriously - trapped inside a drainage pipe.There should be more swords in courting rituals: Hos brother had made a sword, as was custom. He had stood before Mayen with the blade resting on the backs of his hands. And she stepped forward, witnessed by all, to take the weapon from him. Carrying it back to her home. Betrothal. A year from that day she would emerge from the doorway with that sword. then, using it to excavate a tench before the threshold, she would set it down in the earth and bury it. Iron and soil, weapon and home. Man and woman. Marriage.Ominous much?: Today, the empire is reborn. In violence and blood, as with all births. And what, when this day is done, shall we find lying, in our laps? Eyes opening onto this world?Oft forgotten wisdom: I am a caster of nets. Tyrants and emperors rise and fall. Civilizations burgeon then die, but there are always casters of nets. And tillers of the soil, and herders in the pastures. We are where civilization begins, and when it ends, we are there to begin it again.Funny how quickly priorities can change: \"Enough of that. We have what we need. Time for everyone [i.e.: the ghosts she brought with her] to leave.\"A chorus of wavering voices answered her. \"We don't want to.\"\"There'll be priests coming. Probably already on their way. And mages eager to collect wraiths to enslave as their servants for eternity.\"\"We're leaving!\"Worst. Collection. Ever.: \"Curios, most of them. Some antiques. I am fascinated with forging techniques, particularly those used by foreign peoples. Also, there is sorcery invested in these weapons.\"\"All of them?\" \"Yes. No, put that one back, Finadd. It's cursed. In fact, they're all cursed. Well, this could prove a problem.\"Michael Phelps would get away with so much crime: Any criminal who could swim across the canal with a sack of docks [coins] strapped to his back won freedom. The amount of coin was dependent upon the nature of the transgression.Understatement of the book: Good things came of being nice to a Jaghut, something the T'lan Imass never understood.A little too close to reality: Civilization after civilization, it is the same. The world falls to tyranny with a whisper. The frightened are ever keen to bow to a perceived necessity, in the belief that necessity forces conformity, and conformity a certain stability.Well, if you are going to break one law, why not break all of them: \"That's him. Tarthenal half-blood. So they've added two hundred docks to his fine.\"\"What did he do?\"\"What didn't he do? Murder times three, destruction of property, assault, kidnapping times two, cursing, fraud, failure to pay debt and voiding in public. All in one afternoon.\"What's good for the goose...: \"We have brought gifts!\"\"For which you will then charge us, with interest. We are familiar with your pattern of cultural conquest among neighboring tribes, Prince. That the situation is now reversed earns our sympathy, but as you are wont to say, business is business.Go with what you know: \"They've made a mess. I mean to cleanse it.\"\"Ice. The Jaghut answer to everything.\"\"And what would yours be, Mael [Elder God of the Seas]? Flood, or... flood?\""}, {"userName": "Alissa", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24456819-alissa", "userReview": "'... the assumption is the foundation stone of Letherii society, perhaps all societies the world over. The notion of inequity, my friends. For from inequity derives the concept of value, whether measured by money or the countless other means of gauging human worth. Simply put, there resides in all of us the unchallenged belief that the poor and the starving are in some way deserving of their fate. In other words, there will always be poor people. A truism to grant structure to the continual task of comparison, the establishment through observation of not our mutual similarities, but our essential differences.'"}], "description": "After decades of warfare, the five tribes of the Tiste Edur are united under the implacable rule of the Warlock King of the Hiroth.
