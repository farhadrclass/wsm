The story of a yong boy named Thomas who lived in the south of the France during WWII. His grand father was a banker and he protected Jews' money from the nazis. He was killed by the nazis without giving them the codes to unlock the money they desperatly need. His daughter knows the codes as well as her son, Thomas. And now he is tracked down by a very intelligent man, a monster name Laemmle, whose mission is to kidnap Thomas to force his mother to show up and give the nazis the codes. After his mother was killed, Thomas will try to escape Laemmle alone through Europe at war. His only help is his bodyguard, a gifted sniper."}, {"userName": "Lilias Bennie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4973449-lilias-bennie", "userReview": "I have always stated that this is one of my most favourite books of all time.

This book somehow calls out for clich\u00e9d opinions usually splashed across the bottom of a movie poster. That aside it is the perfect summer/airplane/lazy Sunday afternoon read. A suspenseful thriller set in Europe during WWII, it pits a genius 11 year old, Thomas, against the sadistic, brilliant manhunter Laemmle and the Nazis. With hundreds of millions of reichmarks at stake, Thomas, supported by Spanish snipers and someone who may or may not be his father, must elude his pursuers across occupied and unoccupied Europe.

And written by a French author. You can buy it just for $ 0.01 on Amazon. :)From Publishers WeeklyWith superb plotting, mesmerizing characters and brilliant chase scenes, Daddy will enthrall connossieurs of suspense and intrigue from its opening sentences to the emotionally charged denouement. At the heart of this taut, psychological, action-packed thriller set in the early 1940s is Thomas, an exceptional 11-year-old boy whose mind, a well-oiled, precise \"machine,\" contains the complicated codes to 724 secret Swiss bank accounts, a fortune the Nazis have been trying to get at for many years. Their operative is a 46-year-old professor of philosophy, reputed to be the most intelligent man in the Third Reich. Like two chess grand masters, the hunter and his quarry ingeniously outmaneuver each other, each understanding the superior intelligence of his opponent and able to anticipate the other's moves several steps in advance. The drama is heightened by the boy's intense relationships with his beautiful and elusive mother, who trained him for his mission, and with his almost-invisible Spanish bodyguards and a network of supporters from France, Switzerland and Spain set up by her in advance. Particularly poignant is Thomas's relationship with a well-connected American banker who did not know of the boy's existence until asked by the woman he once loved to endanger his own life to save his son's. As sensitive as he is intelligent, Thomas guards against attachment to the man who is his father: too many people he has loved have been savagely murdered by the Nazis. Durand has written several French bestsellers under a pseudonym; Daddy, the first work published in the U.S. under his real name, was a leading bestseller in France. Considering the mastery he displays in this popular genre, readers will anxiously await more."}, {"userName": "Danielle Tremblay", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13712421-danielle-tremblay", "userReview": "Le 18 septembre 1942, Thomas f\u00eate ses onze ans.

There were times that very specific details were given about someone who was so peripheral to the plot that they didn't even physically appear in the story. While I appreciate that the little details help to create the bigger world for the story to flourish, those details should still feel like they have relevance at the time you're reading them.While the characters were well written they all felt a bit too contrived. The American was the perfect male hero you might find in a 1920s or 30s pulp novel, his one flaw was physical, a limp he'd gained from some heroic and manly deed in the past. The Nazi villain was suitably sadistic and cunning but his obsession in the boy became a little too convenient for the progression of the story. I think I actually liked the boy's character because I found the idea of developing his intellect so he thought like a 'machine' in order to survive interesting. The narrator overdid this though by constantly repeating how clever he and yellow eyes were, when it could have been subtler.The way everyone fell in love with the boy and the woman was a little annoying too, I would have thought that some people might find that little boy rather annoying and others might resent the massive responsibilities the woman left on so many different people's shoulders.A character I did like was Miquel, who was so good at hiding that no one could ever see him unless he wanted them too. This idea was played quite comic book in its extremity but I quite enjoyed that. His methods were never divulged, he just appeared when necessary, which added to his mystique.The thing that annoyed me most though was the concept that the entire novel hung on. The boy had to learn all these codes relating to hundreds of millions of dollars but why? At the end he goes to a bank in Switzerland and tells a group of people the information and it's all over. But why couldn't he do that sooner? So in summary, quite an enjoyable and gripping read (in parts) but some of the fundamentals bothered me which slightly inhibited my enjoyment of it."}, {"userName": "Derek Davis", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1950709-derek-davis", "userReview": "Oh feh! Nothing's worse than somebody with an excellent idea who fucks it up six ways to Sunday. Loup Durand, first of all, is a pseudonym and a damned silly one. Second, he simply doesn't like most of his characters, so why does he write about them? Third, he takes the story of a secret code to untold millions of reichmarks laid away in banks around the world--money that could goose Hitler's war effort mightily if the Nazi's could lay hands on them -- and loses his own interest in it. Fourth through tenth, he drags the reader along thinking something wonderful will eventually happen, but it's just the usual pileup of blood, explosions, absurd coincidence and a battle of masterminds who always -- always -- know exactly what the other is thinking and planning. The nice trick is that one of the masterminds is 11 years old, but Loup Garou wears out the changes on this about a quarter of the way through. The gay Nazi counterpart is effete, nasty, but of course tortured. Well, who the hell cares -- torture him some more! The Daddy character is a Rockefeller nephew with suddenly gains smarts and abilities he never knew he had, making him able to outsmart all the stupid Nazis. Then, for a never clearly explained reason, he is given the lowdown on the lowdown dealings between the financial worlds of Germany and the US, and you know what happens? He decides he doesn't like the rest of his relatives!

I could see it in a movie...it is based in France, mostly, but a bit of Spain and Switzerland as well. I'm heading for the port of Sanary in less than a month as well as a shore excursion to Aix en Provence, and this book hits right at the heart of where I'm going, so I'm really pumped to be in the vicinity of all this action! The story of an 11 year old genius boy that has been required to remember the codes and numbers of all funds ($350 million) his grandfather took from the Nazis is the key to why he rarely sees his mother and all the tight security while he was growing up. He knows how to beat anyone at chess and applies the game in his head like a machine while on the run. This is an action-packed story, edge of your seat suspense that I've rarely come across is a sad one as well as everyone he loves is in the kill-zone everywhere he runs.

Ce n'est donc pas r\u00e9ellement un jeune gar\u00e7on que l'on d\u00e9couvre mais une redoutable personne d'un point de vue strat\u00e9gique m\u00eame si souvent, sa jeunesse le rend tr\u00e8s sensible ce qui m'a tr\u00e8s souvent touch\u00e9e. Laemmle, lui, est missionn\u00e9 pour \u00e0 attraper Thomas pour lui faire dire ces codes bancaires que r\u00e9clame Hitler.
