She was lying on the couch in the living room and asked me to boil her a potato. I, being 19, had NO idea how to boil a potato! But I did not want to bother her about it - so I went into the kitchen and started up the pot of water.Not only did I ruin that cute little potato ... but I saw my grandmother lose it!! She came into the kitchen and saw the whole potato (not peeled or cut) hanging out in the pot and lost it. She started crying... How can I leave you if you can't even boil a potato?! My grandfather happened to arrive home at that moment. He did a big sigh when he heard and saw the commotion. My poor frail grandma rolling around on the stool (too weak to stand up even), throwing pans around as she was trying to find another pot to make her potato in. He got her calmed down and fixed her another potato. But before it was even boiled she made him go out to the store \"right this minute\" and buy me the joy of cooking.She knew that she would not always be in the kitchen with me to help me cook -- so she got me a GREAT back up.That is how I knew my grandmother wasn't going to get better and that I had better learn how to boil a potato.I love you grandmother!"}, {"userName": "Carey", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/948957-carey", "userReview": "The 1997 edition is infallible. The pre-1997 editions are good if you want to can or pickle your own veg, cook opossum, and make aspic. The fifth edition, ie the 75th Anniversary edition shown in the picture above, contains too much retro-inspired nonsense and does not continue the practical and innovative approach laid out in the 1997 edition. Basically, the 1997 edition took the heart of the Joy of Cooking, that is, that it is a book that contains all the recipes your average american cook needs, and updated it for the 1997 american palate (added in asian and mexican foods, , removed casseroles made with mushroom soup, etc). The first person narrative of the other editions was mostly removed. The 75th anniversary editions does no further innovation, and instead adds in some of the older recipes and sections (with limited practical use, in my opion), and adds a good bit of personal narrative back in. If you're serious about cooking, find the 1997 edition, it will never let you down. If you're interested in the evolution of american recipes from the perspective of the Becker family, the 75th anniversary edition is your book."}, {"userName": "Rob", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/156533-rob", "userReview": "I would not consider this my \"everyday\" cookbook but the The Joy of Cooking is a definite must for anyone that takes their cooking seriously, enjoys spending a bit of time in the kitchen, and needs a good all-purpose reference that covers everything from emergency substitutions to complete banquet spreads.What do I like most about The Joy of Cooking? It is fairly encyclopedic, covering about as broad a range of cooking topics as it can; while most of the recipes are from the Western tradition, it also dips into some less traditional preparations (e.g., ceviche). The book does not assume that you know anything about cooking -- not sure what a \"dash\" is? You can look up an explanation for that. What's the difference between a filet and a cutlet? It explains that, too. (HINT: they're basically synonymous.) It has a great index, is organized well, and has recipes to cover almost any occasion and varying degrees of culinary sophistication.What don't I like about The Joy of Cooking? It's encyclopedic nature can be a little intimidating sometimes. If you already have a good idea of what you want to make, there's a good chance that you'll find a great recipe; if you're looking for ideas though, the text may overwhelm you. Speaking of text -- the pictures are all illustrations. Granted, they're good illustrations but I tend to prefer photos in my cookbooks (helps me decide what to try next).One last point about The Joy of Cooking: I would recommend it to everyone except vegetarians. The book assumes an omnivore's diet so if you eschew the animals in your diet, I would estimate that greater than half of these recipes would not appeal to you."}, {"userName": "Dianne", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/274923-dianne", "userReview": "In their attempt to modernize the book, the authors omitted many recipes and techniques that are still relevant. Where is Sole Florentine, for heavens sake? And while not many families routinely can or freeze food as a winter survival strategy, there are still times when I would like to know how to do it - when my CSA gives me more corn than we can manage, or when local strawberries are beautiful, fresh, plentiful, and cheap. The lack of ice cream recipes is frustrating, especially given that so many manufacturers are making good quality electric powered ice cream makers.On the other hand, there are lots of new recipes that reflect the increasing influx of immigrant culture (and food!) into America.I'd say, Definitely buy this book, but don't chuck your old editions of Joy just yet.

This is my second copy. The first, a paperback, became so tattered and worn that my son presented this valued edition as a gift. I have been cooking for more than forty years, but continue to return to this book for ideas, information and special recipes. On many occasions I search for new ways to prepare foods and will find the ideal formula for preparation. Frequently I will \"tweak\" the recipe in order to please the palates of my diners, but  JOY  has rarely failed to please me.It is important to note here that this is far more than a recipe book. It is possible to sit down and read this hefty tome for information and sheer enjoyment. Aside from the wealth of sections for appetizers, through to a huge array of desserts, there are sections describing a multitude of food facts. One can learn about different grains, exotic fruits and vegetables and the preparation and significance of many ethnic foods. Historical and geograpical factors are also included.I would recommend this above all other cookbooks for both novice and experienced food preparers!

There are recipes for every conceivable type of consumable. Beverages (nonalcoholic and alcoholic), appetizers, snacks, candies, jellies, desserts, sauces/toppings, stuffings, and what goes in-between: simple entrees to full-blown multi-course dinners. The instructions are detailed and easy to understand. Unlike cookbooks that tell you to \"cut into fillets and braise until done\" or \"serve with a piquant sauce,\" the directions take you through step-by-step, always explaining what is really meant. The ingredients range from items found in any supermarket to the more obscure near-alien things that will require serious searching, although most of the ingredients are quite reasonable. There are numerous illustrations throughout, finally letting mankind in on the secret of why some coffee cakes look like they were made from the inside out.Not just recipes, either. This book includes detailed information on selecting, testing for/maintaining freshness, storing (including an entire chapter on freezing), preparing, and cutting the food. Different types of fruit are explained. Half a dozen pages are devoted to informing the reader about wine. Cuts of beef are explained here; it finally explains why chuck is chuck and tip is tip, and where they come from. Table decor, place settings, and appropriate wine glasses are explained too.The writing style is joyful. Clearly, the authors do not just enjoy cooking, serving, and eating the food... they like talking about it, too. There is a gleeful sense of humor throughout, and anecdotes about where the food originated from and how it got its preposterous name. The contents of this cookbook are a treasure.Now for the bad part: the physical book. Had the pages been printed on better quality paper, I would upgrade this poor excuse for a tome to galley status. The paper is clearly manga paper, almost (but not quite) as good as the quality of the phone book paper of your yellow pages, yet not quite as thick. The pages are transparent enough that you do not need to turn the flimsy page to see what is printed on the other side. The text size is small, the same size as the print of the listings in a phone book. The ink quality is atrocious; it's obvious that the photocopying machine used to crank out these pages was running out of toner, giving the book dark-text pages and fuzzy pale-text pages. Sometimes it's hard to tell whether the text is in bold print or if the toner cartridge went into its final death throe. The spiral spine is cheap plastic and does not allow easy page-turning. The quality of this (physical) book is absolutely ridiculous."}, {"userName": "Erin \u2615 *Proud Book Hoarder*", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3048260-erin-proud-book-hoarder", "userReview": "This big, amazing book covers about everything one needs to know.

I'm not that bad, but neither am I a gourmet---I could use some teaching. I've long coveted this doorstopper book of 1,132 pages containing 4,500 recipes and finally broke down and ordered it when I had a Barnes and Noble coupon. It's like an encyclopedia of cooking.It took some getting used to. The recipes aren't organized in the manner I've come to expect. Take, for instance, the beginning of the recipe for Chili Con Carne on page 513:Pat dry:3 pounds boneless beef chuck, trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch cubesSeason with:1 to 2 teaspoons saltHeat in a large skillet over medium-high heat:2 tablespoons olive oilAnd so on. Do you see what I mean? I'm used to recipes that list all the ingredients at the top, with instructions separate beneath.

For one, the length. I get it\u2019s meant to be the guide to cooking, but goodness! It\u2019s a long book, complete with a nutrition guide, a section for entertaining, a section of different menus, plus a bunch more at the end. Examples of those include keeping and storing food, canning, freezing, and knowing your ingredients. Scattered throughout the book are little sections about stuff, like a section about tea, different kinds of pie, and different kinds of cakes.The format of the recipes was odd, but something I could get used to. Here\u2019s the general idea of the format: ingredients, recipe, ingredients, recipe. That\u2019s how I tend to cook, so that\u2019s why I could get used to it. But at the same time, I\u2019m slightly worried about skipping over something. Another annoying (and very distracting) aspect of the format is the references to other pages. Example: Pie. The pie crusts have their own section, so you refer to that, and then proceed as normal for the rest of the recipe. The cakes are a good example too, because the glazes and icings are in a different chapter. Also, some recipes direct you to read different guides. Example: some of the pie recipes direct you to read about fruit pies and rolling pastry dough.Again, I get it\u2019s supposed to be the ultimate guide to cooking or whatever, but found that going back and forth between two different pages distracting. As for directing people to different things to read before making whatever recipe, it\u2019s probably good for beginners, but for me, I found it distracting. Had I moved away from the dessert section, and gone to make, say, pasta or soup, my opinion might be different.So what did I actually like then? There really are a lot of recipes- according to the front cover, 4500 of them! This accounts for a good chunk of the length, and I do like that they\u2019re thorough, and try to be somewhat definitive. The few recipes I tried were really good, and I really did like how the recipes themselves were formatted. Generally speaking, I liked how it was organized, but I felt like it could\u2019ve been slightly better. With multiple recipes on a page, I felt like they could have found a better way to make each recipe stand out.Rating: 3 out of 5. The recipes were good, but I found certain things to be really distracting, which downgraded the rating."}, {"userName": "Steven Peterson", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1677868-steven-peterson", "userReview": "I have a copy of the 1997 edition of \u201cJoy of Cooking.\u201d It is probably my most used cookbook. The recipes are doable (for the most part), clearly written, and produce nice tasting meals! I am a big fan of that classic. And this volume represents the 75th anniversary version of this classic, originally published in 1931.One thing I wanted to do is to see if some of my favorite recipes had been changed. For example, my old copy of \u201cJoy of Cooking\u201d contains a recipe for fried rice that was better than three versions from three cookbooks that I had earlier tried. I have a high comfort level within the 1997 recipe. And, in the 75th anniversary version, that recipe is pretty much the same. I appreciate that!At the front of the book are useful items\u2014such as nutritional information, how to entertain, how to develop menus for various occasions (such as holiday dinners, special occasions (such as a Super Bowl Party\u2014great to see Buffalo chicken wings listed here), and so on.Some interesting points of interest for me. Speaking of Buffalo chicken wings. . . . The recipe for making your own is page 80 (under appetizers and hors d\u2019oeuvres). Ingredients: chicken wings, flour, salt, pepper, vegetable oil, butter, red wine vinegar (or cider vinegar), and hot pepper sauce. On the side, of course, celery sticks and blue cheese dressing to cut the heat. Step by step, the recipe does a nice job of taking you through the process. Simple to make\u2014great to taste! And you can heat it up if you want something fiery, simply by ramping up the amount of pepper sauce.Buffalo. . . . Free association. There are also game recipes here. And two of these feature buffalo meat\u2014buffalo burgers and buffalo rib roast with orange molasses glaze. Every so often, I will buy buffalo (bison) at a nearby store and make simple dishes. The two recipes here are more imaginative than what I normally do, and I look forward to experimenting. Other beasts in the Game section: Bear, Boar, Mountain goat, Venison, and Rabbit. Not sure I\u2019ll explore making these, but it is fun to go through the recipes.Anyhow, I\u2019m not going to throw out my current edition of \u201cJoy of Cooking,\u201d but I\u2019m interested in becoming more acquainted with new recipes (500) as well as updated classics.

As my eyesight is not what it once was, I wish that the print were larger; on the other hand, this book is now 1000 pages long. I'd rather settle for smaller print and a less heavy book! And the length is one of the pluses of this book. Other cookbooks that I have run a few hundred pages and have larger print and pictures. The end result? Far fewer recipes! I am interested in a rich collection of recipes--not something that is easy to read and short on content. And this work has helped me out in the kitchen. For instance, its recipe for fried rice is so much better than recipes from two other comprehensive cookbooks that I use. Another example: the section on poultry provides a great deal of basic generic information, whether on roasting chicken or broiling chicken. . . . In addition, the recipes are pretty easy to understand and to carry out. Some otherwise interesting cookbooks strain for effect and make it much harder for an amateur chef to succeed. Appendices at the end are also helpful. The section on \"Cooking Methods\" explains clearly how to blacken (Cajun style) food (page 1053), how to cook in ashes (page 1056), and so on. Another Appendix on \"Know Your Ingredients,\" too, is helpful. On page 1066, one learns how to make wasabi from raw ingredients. As noted, I have tried many different cookbooks over time.

Since the 20 & 30-somethings are getting so into self-sufficiency and sustainability, what with the composting and paying extra for locally grown food, why not resurrect a cookbook that encourages making everything from scratch and not wasting things like chicken livers?"}, {"userName": "Diane Solomon", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49262021-diane-solomon", "userReview": "How do you review a bible in the kitchen? My mother had a copy, the cover torn, dog-eared, and smeared with a wide conglomeration of various batters. When we finally laid it to rest, I ceremoniously gave her a new copy for Christmas my junior year of high school.Same story for me. I bought a copy in my early twenties, while living in England and I used it up. That's the only way to describe it. Remember when you used to wear out record albums, for those of you old enough to have had a vinyl LP? You had to go buy a new copy because you'd made it such a part of your life that it just wore out. That is the case with \"The Joy of Cooking.\" So twenty years late I had to replace my copy and now it is already looking worn and ragged.That is the best review I can give! It is the \"go-to\" book for every single thing I need to do, figure out, or try, when it comes to baking, roasting, braising, frying, you name it. I have a couple of dozen other cookbooks. A few have a few good recipes, and I'm glad I have them. But they aren't \"The Joy of Cooking.\""}, {"userName": "Caroline", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10502554-caroline", "userReview": "I remember greatly anticipating the publication of the 1997 edition. When I first set out on my own in 1989, my mom bought me the most current edition at the time (the 1975 edition). By the time the 1997 edition rolled around, I was expecting our first child and was so excited to see what \"my edition\" would have. I was so disappointed. So many of my childhood favorites were gone. The entire section on preserving was gone! Today, my 1975 edition has stained pages, a hard cover that barely hangs on, a missing bookmark ribbon, and is slightly, permanently sticky on the back. Scrawled on the inside front cover is a message from my mom. Next to this classic sits the 1997 edition, almost bright white, dust-jacket still intact, not a stain to be had. I keep it because it has an inscription from my husband to me. One day (too soon) I will give that one to my first born. But not before I also buy her a used copy of 1975!"}], "description": "Since its original publication, Joy of Cooking has been the most authoritative cookbook in America, the one upon which millions of cooks have confidently relied for more than sixty-five years. It's the book your grandmother and mother probably learned to cook from, the book you gave your sister when she got married. This, the first revision in more than twenty years, is better than ever. Here's why: Every chapter has been rethought with an emphasis on freshness, convenience, and health.All the recipes have been reconceived and tested with an eye to modern taste, and the cooking knowledge imparted with each subject enriched to the point where everyone from a beginning to an experienced cook will feel completely supported.The new Joy continues the vision of American cooking that began with the first edition of Joy. It is still the book you can turn to for perfect Beef Wellington and Baked Macaroni and Cheese. It's also the book where you can now find Turkey on the Grill, Spicy Peanut Sesame Noodles, and vegetarian meals.The new Joy provides more thorough descriptions of ingredients, from the familiar to the most exotic. For instance, almost all the varieties of apples grown domestically are described-- the months they become available, how they taste, what they are best used for, and how long they keep. But for the first time Joy features a complete section on fresh and dried chili peppers: how to roast and grill them, how to store them, and how long they keep-- with illustrations of each pepper.An all-new \"RULES\" section in many chapters gives essential cooking basics at a glance: washing and storing salad greens, selecting a pasta and a matching sauce, determining when a piece of fish is cooked through, stuffing a chicken, and making a perfect souffle.New chapters reflect changing American tastes and lifestyles:Separate new chapters on grains, beans, and pasta include recipes for grits, polenta, pilafs, risottos, vegetarian chills, bean casseroles, and make-ahead lasagnes.New baking and dessert chapters promise to enhance Joy of Cooking's reputation as a bible for bakers. Quick and yeast bread recipes range from focaccia, pizza, and sourdoughs to muffins and coffee cakes. Separate chapters cover custards and puddings, pies and tarts, cookies, cakes, cobblers, and other American fruit desserts revived for this edition. Recipes include one-bowl cakes, gingerbread, angel and sponge cakes, meringues, pound cakes, fruitcakes, 6 different kinds of cheesecake-- there's even an illustrated wedding cake recipe, which takes you through all the stages from building a stand, making and decorating the cake, to transporting it to the reception without a hitch.Little Dishes showcases foods from around the world: hummus, baba ghanoush, bruschetta, tacos, empanadas, and fried wontons.AII new drawings of techniques, ingredients, and equipment, integrated throughout an elegant new design, and over 300 more pages round out the new Joy.Among this book's other unique features: microwave instructions for preparing beans, grains, and vegetables; dozens of new recipes for people who are lactose intolerant and allergic to gluten; expanded ingredients chart now features calories, essential vitamins, and levels of fats and cholesterol. There are ideas for substitutions to lower fat in recipes and reduced-fat recipes in the baking sections.From cover to cover, Joy's chapters have been imbued with the knowledge and passion of America's greatest cooks and cooking teachers. An invaluable combination of old and new, this edition of Joy of Cooking promises to keep you cooking for years to come.", "title": "The Joy of Cooking", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/327847.The_Joy_of_Cooking", "average": 4.13, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1379313627l/327847.jpg", "reviews": 1052, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/42697.Irma_S_Rombauer", "name": "Irma S.
