I two-starred a book with heavy subject matter, with practically no reviews of substance to be seen that gave it less than four stars. Which means the masses love it and I'm standing up to say, \"Hold on a minute, though.\" This basically puts me in the position that my Five Days at Memorial review did. First of all, I two-starred the BOOK. Not the Holocaust, not the women themselves or their stories. My unfavorable opinion of Born Survivors doesn't have to do with content, it's about the way that content has been arranged and presented as a BOOK. Because that's what we're supposed to be rating/reviewing here, or at least I think so. Rate Holden's work here, folks, not the titular mothers. While there was an impressive volume of information, it was presented in a haphazard and disorderly way. Even the stories of the three young mothers were shuffled in a way that created confusion. We started with background information on Priska, followed her all the way to being transported, then typewritered back to start with Rachel and follow HER all the way to transport, then typewritered AGAIN for Anka. But these three storylines also aren't happening on concurrent dates. This means that, despite efforts to organize things into three distinct stories, we're describing same historical backdrop three times. Which means that any historical referents made during these first three chapters read like a skipping record. A minor offense, I suppose, except that later, Holden changes her strategy and begins to organize things not into distinct \"Priska, Rachel, Anka\" columns, but instead by dates/events (\"The Camps\", \"The Death Marches\", etc.). Then we experience the opposite problem--trying to sort out who's who, and what each woman's individual circumstances are as Holden runs around trying to keep all three balls in the air, so to speak. Basically, there was a TON of information here, and I think it got away from Holden a little. There were conflicting goals here, both to relate a heroic story of survival with three protagonists who never interacted, and to explain the historical details of the Holocaust to a reader who, after all, doesn't have encyclopedic knowledge of who/where/when everything was. Each of these goals stood in the way of the other. For instance, there were these aggravating little cutaway clauses mid-story that sketched in background information irrelevant to the narrative flow of the story. Example (NOT a direct quote): Rachel looked down in fear as Mengele, who had received the Iron Cross, asked her again if she was pregnant.See, it's interesting that Mengele had an iron cross, but Rachel doesn't know that and it doesn't much matter to her, now, does it? It detracts from Rachel's terror and the pressing question \"Are you pregnant\" to include a biographical side-note on Mengele like that. This is exactly what I'm talking about when I say that the story and the history stood in each others' way. In fact, this results in an even clunkier phrase: \"but of course, [she/they] didn't know that.\"For example (NOT a direct quote): The camp had a reputation as the deadliest ever built, and had been created to house Russian POWs. Of course, Anka didn't know this as she passed beneath the formidable gate. She only cared about surviving. This pattern of sketching in historical details, then reaffirming that the mothers didn't know any of them, was maddening. And it happened a LOT. Why choose to yank the readers out of the narrative flow to provide background, only to plunge us abruptly back in with the assertion that the background wasn't important and indeed wasn't known at all to the women? I'm not suggesting that the history should've been excluded completely, I'm just saying that the transitions between the two were clunky. Again, Holden had a lot of balls to keep in the air and didn't do it terribly smoothly. Then there were a few notable cases where an almost callously colloquial narrator showed its face. In the most startling instance, one of the mothers feared that her relatives were \"sucking on gas\". In a book that tried to hold on to an almost chilly, informative narrative voice, these few moments of poetic license were unpleasant. So listen, future unsatisfied readers of Born Survivors, it's OKAY to two-star a Holocaust book. Because nobody's belittling or two-starring the Holocaust. There are deeply irritating elements of Holden's compilation and writing at work here. That's how you can find these stories so inspiring and unbelievable, but still not enjoy the book all that much. It's not wrong to be critical of the writing, even with socially and emotionally-charged subject matter. It wasn't wrong for Five Days at Memorial and it isn't wrong here. We have a duty to judge these books not simply on the inspirational value of their content, but on the quality of the writing that delivers these stories to us. Or at least I think so. And hey, five-star reviewers, if this book was an emotionally enlightening or transformative experience for you, that's great. I just need a book that's stronger in its bones than this one. Hands down, the writing makes up the bones of a book, and the writing of Born Survivors just isn't up to scratch."}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3454514-maria", "userReview": "Oriundas de pa\u00edses diferentes (Priska \u00e9 natural da Eslov\u00e9nia, onde em 1944 os relatos do que acontecia nos campos ainda tinham pouco cr\u00e9dito, Rachel da Pol\u00f3nia, onde os judeus eram v\u00edtimas de um preconceito generalizado, e Anka da Rep\u00fablica Checa), n\u00e3o deixa de ser uma coincid\u00eancia terem acabado por chegar a Auschwitz nos \u00faltimos meses de 1944.\"Apesar de tudo o que tinham passado, admitir que Hitler estava a falar a s\u00e9rio quando prometera erra dicar todos os seres humanos de origem \u00e9tnica indesej\u00e1vel, por forma a criar uma ra\u00e7a superior, estava para l\u00e1 do que eram capazes de imaginar.

Although the three women didn't know each other at the time, they shared a common ground - they were all newly pregnant when they were sent to the now infamous death camps across Europe. Impeccably researched and sensitively told, each of the three women's stories are both harrowing and uplifting. This book showcases a side of the camps not widely known; when a prisoner is pregnant, what is to become of her child? Some parts of the book make for difficult reading but this should not deter history enthusiasts from reading it. The treatment of babies and children by the nazi officers is particularly challenging to comprehend. At times it's a struggle to believe that everything documented - and thousands more untold stories - happened to real people who's only crime was their heritage and/or religious beliefs. The book follows up what happened to each of the women in post wartime, and of their subsequent marriages and lives. Tellingly, all three women did not go on to have further children; meaning those babies born to the imprisoned women share a special bond to this day. Powerful and unforgettable. It was a privilege to read about these courageous women."}, {"userName": "Camie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7399266-camie", "userReview": "The harrowing true accounts here follow the lives of three amazing women Anka, Priska, and Rachel all of whom, against the odds , survive the horrors of the Holocaust death camps and even more miraculously give birth while imprisoned and manage to keep their babies alive.

I'm not Jewish. As far as I know none of my relatives perished during the Holocaust. In fact, aside from telling the stories contained within these pages, the events affect me not at all. Yet, it does. When I was 16, my parents took me to Germany. Specifically, to Dachau. There I met a man named Martin. He was a Polish officer who refused to support the Third Reich. He walked me through the camp pointing at things and saying, \"They hung my father from that tree just before liberation.\" I was mortified. However, I have never forgotten the inked numbers on his arm or the horror that he lived. I won't either. Martin's story was horrific. It was tragic. It was Hell. However, the story that I just read about Rachel, Anka and Priska is so much more demonic. Holden describes the trains in such detail that you can smell the unwashed bodies and human waste. She enables the reader to look up in the sky and see the flames coming from the chimneys and you can taste the human ash that falls like snow. You feel the birthing pains, the fear, the hopelessness and the determination. \"Born Survivors\" is so much more than an account of three women and the Holocaust that tried to kill them. This is a memorial to every victim and every survivor. This is proof that the human spirit can and does overcome everything. Broken hearts do mend and hope thrives even in the darkest of places. The three babies born into madness saved humanity in that moment. In reality, I am so moved by this piece that I am having a hard time putting the emotions into words. I'll put it this way. This isn't a \"should\" read, it's a \"MUST\" read. I believe that every human being alive at this moment should stand in a concentration camp at least once. Every person alive needs to see the photos and read the stories while standing where these atrocities occurred. However, that isn't possible. I believe that this book does the same thing. Holden does not sugar coat the truth. She stripped it naked and exposed it to the world. It's hard to accept that humans did these these to other adults. To be confronted with the reality of what happened to the children and infirm is almost beyond comprehension. This book forces the reader to face the evil that was the Holocaust. My 13 year old son will be reading this next. When my youngest is a bit older, he will as well.  Ms. Holden, I have no idea how you slogged through this dark matter to write this book but you've done an amazing job. Thank you.

However, this one is different because there is a good outcome for the three women highlighted in this book. Each of these three women, through good luck or miracle or whatever you want to call it, survived Auschwitz and were sent to Mauthausen were they survived until the war ended. All three women - Priska, Rachel, and Anka - were in their early pregnancies when they were first sent to Auschwitz and were wise enough not to share that information. Their stories were horrible and its amazing that they were able to deliver healthy babies. The three women never knew each other at the camps but the three children connected as adults and this is the story that they shared with Wendy Holden. The author did an amazing job of pulling the stories together and getting information on the three women's early history. All three women lost the majority of their families and their husbands in the camps but they each had a child who survived under unbelievable circumstances. Even though its a very heart breaking and sad story, there is a real sense of survival at the end of it.

A story of how three women and their newly born infants survived the Holocaust is so powerful and disturbing that I experienced emotions ranging from rage to gratitude. I am continually stunned by the inhumanity and torture they endured. Priska, Rachel and Anka did not know each other although they were in the same camps - each guarding their secret pregnancy that if known would have guaranteed their immediate death. How they survived and protected their babies is a remarkable story. My gratitude is due to those angels that despite being in grave danger, did the morally right thing to help the prisoners when they could....especially the Czech town of Horni Briza. I highly recommend this book, even though it made me cry...especially the last few chapters.

Plus, reading stories of the Holocaust all in a row makes me feel not as shocked as I should be. I am not sure if I can put it correctly in words, but it makes the story seem banal. Like something that happened a long time ago and will not happen again. I do prefer non-fiction over fiction, regarding Holocaust, as it makes it fair to the survivors.

This book tells the story of three separate women who were all in the very early stages of pregnancy in 1944 when they were separated from their husbands, imprisoned, and sent to Auschwitz. Through sheer luck, all three women escaped being gassed and as the war drew to a close, all three were sent to Mauthausen concentration camp through a hellish train journey that killed hundreds. Remarkably, all three women gave birth to live children and escaped with their lives. The three women never knew they had fellow expectant mothers in the camp with them. As adults, their children discovered they were not the only baby born in the camp and connected and shared their stories. Today they are considered some of the last living survivors of the Nazi concentration camps. Like any book about the Holocaust, this book is incredibly emotionally difficult to read. Throughout, I was continually struck by the sheer luck and chance that meant the survival of Priska, Rachel, and Anka and their three children. Thousands just like them perished. Many, many pregnant women were killed before they could deliver, miscarried before full-term, were subjects of inhumane experiments under Nazi physician Mengele, or their children were taken from them and killed through a variety of atrocious means. It is nothing short of a miracle that these three individuals were spared similar fates. It's also nothing short of a miracle that severely malnourished women were able to give birth to live babies that were capable of survival and healthy growth. \"I will never forget the look on his face when he stared at this pregnant corpse, weighing maybe sixty-five pounds and most of it belly...a scarcely living skeleton without hair and dirty as you can imagine\" (235). All of the babies were only around three pounds at birth. Most of their survival was indeed sheer chance, such as their denial of pregnancy when being questioned by Mengele or the fact that the random clothes the three women were thrown after being stripped of their own clothing were large, baggy items of clothing that concealed their growing stomachs. Although the three women were strangers and never knew one another, their stories were eerily alike. So alike, in fact, that I had hard time as a reader differentiating between the three women. Each of their individual childhood and family stories is shared in the first section of the book and later chapters, once the women were in the camp, blend their stories together as they suffer the same fate, making it more difficult for me to keep their stories separate. Despite the horror of these women's stories, I feel fortunate to be able to read their story. Despite the atrocities they endured, they managed to survive and also save their children, who marked a new beginning for their life after the war. Sadly, each woman lost the majority of her family and all their husbands died in the camps. It was such a bittersweet poignant moment to read how each women desperately hoped their husband would return, but knowing the chances were slim to none. Additionally, I was especially moved that the three children of the women in this story wrote the forward to this book, recognizing that their mothers' stories are now preserved so anyone can witness the ordeal they endured and survived."}, {"userName": "Hannie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16141759-hannie", "userReview": "Een indrukwekkend boek.

Dat is ook zo. Toch denk ik dat juist door die feiten wel te vermelden duidelijk wordt wat die vrouwen allemaal hebben doorstaan. Een bijzonder stuk vond ik ook dat toen de vrouwen onderweg waren naar Mauthausen en ze een tijdje gestrand waren op een station de verantwoordelijke stationschef en veel inwoners van het stadje er alles aan gedaan hebben om de vrouwen te helpen door onder andere massaal eten te brengen. Ik vind dat stuk bijzonder, omdat omstanders vaak niets deden. Bovendien was het voor hen ook risicovol in verband met repressailes van de SS.

It is 400 pages long and it published by HarperCollins. The cover is blue with two pieces of razor-wire and three birds on it. The intended reader is someone who is interested in World War II history, women's history, and survival against all the odds. There is no language, no sex, and some violence in this book. The story is told from third person with first person interviews, letters, and other first hand resources. There Be Spoilers Ahead.From the back of the book- A remarkable inspirational story about three expectant mothers who defied death at the hands of the Nazis to give their children life.Among millions of Holocaust victims sent to Auschwitz II- Birkenau in 1944, Priska, Rachel, and Anka each pass throught its infamous gates with a secret. Strangers to each other, they are newly pregnant and facing an uncertain fate without their husbands. Alone, scared, and with so many loved ones already lost to the Nazis, these young women are privately determined to hold on to all they have left: their lives and those of their unborn babies.That the gas chambers ran out of Zyklon B just after the babies were born, before they and their mothers could be exterminated, is just one of the several miracles that allowed them all to survive and rebuild their lives after World War II. Born Survivors follows the mothers' incredible journey- first to Auschwitz, where they each came under the scrutiny of Dr. Josef Mengele; then to a German slave-labor camp where, half-starved and almost worked to death, they struggled to conceal their condition; and finally, as the Allies closed in, their hellish train journey with thousands of other prisoners to the Mauthausen death camp in Austria.Sixty-five years later, the three 'miracle babies' meet for the first time at Mauthausen for the anniversary of the American liberation. In Born Survivors, Wendy Holden brings all three stories together for the first time, to mark their seventieth birthdays and the seventieth anniversary of the ending of the war.Review- -A heartbreaking but up-lifting story about survival. I think knowing that the women and babies survived helped to make this story bearable. The story is very intense and at times frightening. These women face some of the most terrifying men and environments known and they survive. Not only do they survive during but after they go on to have lives with their children, grand-children, and great-grand-children. The odds were against the women and their babies but they did it. With help from family or friends they survived. The children were born either on the way or in Mauthausen just days before the Allies freed them. The death toll that they survived is always there in the background. Holden will give how many people died each day before the Allies arrived. The little things that went their way or against the Nazis will. Everything that added up to the impossible and one incredible story.I give this book a Five out of Five stars.

Neskutocne prepracovane dielo vzdavam poklonu autorke, ze sa dokazala popasovat tak grandiozne s napadom ktory dostala, ked sa dozvedela o osude troch babatiek. Prve tri kapitoly knihy su venovane trom hlavnym postavam slovenke Priske, polke R\u00e1chel a ceske Anke vykresluju ich zivoty od narodenia pred vojnou a pocas vojny az do momentu ked kazda z nich nestoji naha v tabore Auschwitz II Birkenau pred Mengelem. Dalej sa kniha odvija od tohto momentu a vykazuje zivot troch zien, ktore sa rozhodli zabojovat o zivot, ktory nosili pod srdcom a vydrzat. Opisuje co vsetko pocas vojny zazili, ako sa narodili vsetky babatka. Autorka opisuje ako doslo k oslobodeniu tabora a ako sa zaclenili do zivota po opusteni koncentraku, ako prezili svoj zivot az do smrti a opisuje aj zivot babatiek. Kniha nie je len opisom zien a ich babatiek je dokonale popretkavana vypovedami prezivsich, ktorych dokazala autorka najst a poznali sa s niektorou z troch menovanych. Dokonca je kniha doplnena aj vypovedami americkych vojakov ktori boli pri oslobodeni. Je to neskutocny pribeh troch zien, ktore boli tak blizko seba prezili svoje osudy takmer spolocne ale nikdy o sebe nevedeli. Az neskora zhoda nahod dokazala spojit babatka. Autorka napisala knihu ktora by nemala chybat v ruke kazdeho, kto sa o tuto problematiku zaujima je to jedna z najlepsich knih ake som citala. Kniha je hodna toho aby si ju precitalo co najviac ludi a dalej sa sirilo jej posolstvo. Lebo ako vieme ludia zabudaju. Za normalnych okolnosti by som si knihu nechala doma ale myslim si ze tato kniha musi putovat musi sa proste dostat k co najviac ludom a preto ju ponuknem dalej lebo viem ze vzhladom k cene si ju nie kazdy moze dovolit kupit novu...a vsetkych citatelov vyzyvam hladajte a kupte si tuto knihu, jej kupu neolutujete a dusevne vas nesmierne obohati :)"}, {"userName": "Al\u00edpio Vieira Firmino", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18912144-al-pio-vieira-firmino", "userReview": "Apesar de anteriormente ter tido acesso a in\u00fameros relatos em document\u00e1rios, filmes e livros sobre o holocausto, a autora conseguiu deixar-me surpreendido e chocado com a mesma intensidade que fiquei da primeira vez...

Only 300,000 of Poland's 3.3 million Jews had survived WWII. The United States eventually accepted some 400,000 refugees but denied many more access to a new life here. Unwelcome anywhere else in the world, many Polish Jews had little alternative but to return to what was by then a Soviet puppet state. With survival admittedly just a matter of luck, this entirely densely written work of non-fiction, tackled perfectly by Author Wendy Holden, takes us from the beautiful, healthy, grateful, wealthy lives of three Jewish women and their husbands and into their fearful, imprisoned, tortured, starved, sickened, unfathomable life of horrors endured in various concentration camps, German factories, and slave labor camps over Europe under Nazi rule while pregnant and miraculously postbirth. This is an exhausting story of survival, only possible due to people of compassion, mothers who fought for their lives and the lives of their babies, and thankfully American allied intervention and liberation in May 1945, \"those tanks with the white stars.\" The rebuilding of lives where towns and sometimes entire families were destroyed is unimaginably heartbreaking. The reunions between the grown children and their aged liberators are heartbreaking and inspirational. The visiting of Mauthausen where three babies were secretly born and now are adult orphans walking arm and arm as forever 'siblings of the heart' is so incredibly empowering -- Mark, Eva and Hana. I always feel a duty to read Holocaust books; I'm relieved I have finished this one. It's amazing to hear these stories of courageous freedoms.

Sozinhas, assustadas, e ap\u00f3s terem perdido tantos familiares \u00e0s m\u00e3os dos nazis, sentiam-se determinadas em lutar pelo que lhes restava: as vidas dos seus beb\u00e9s.

This story of three holocaust survivors and their experiences in the concentration camps is harrowing. All three give birth and their \"miracle babies\" meet some 65 years later. (This is NOT a spoiler...the information is on the book flap). Should be a fascinating read, right? Not so. I read for three reasons: 1) To learn something 2) To be entertained/enthralled/compelled/intrigued 3) To enjoy the beauty of the writingThis book failed me entirely on numbers two and three. I will admit that I learned about these three individual women but that's where the substance ended for me. The writing is disjointed and awkward. The author did a lot of research but put it together in a way that was distracting. I imagine she gathered information from the three families and also gathered historical facts about the war and the camps. Instead of melding it seamlessly she put the biographical background in separate chapters titled: Priska, Rachel and Anka and THEN filled in the historical information in a loose chronological order. The result takes away from the flow of the story.Now let me bore you with some horrible, careless writing (or is it careless editing?) Nonsensical fragment: Page 128: \"As more blocks were needed, so they were made of local wood.\"Page 187: \"....Priska, Rachel and Anka still knew nothing each other.\" (Missing OF maybe?)Page 204: \"....Edita, who wept at the news that the baby had been PART named after her.\" (emphasis mine)Page 268: \"-Adolf Hitler and his new bride Eva Braun SAT SIT side by side....\"UGH. There are many more errors and they distract from the story. These three women SHOULD have their stories told. Their survival and the survival of their babies is nothing short of miraculous. The children and grandchildren SHOULD have a record of the horrors of the camps and the triumphant determination of Priska, Rachel and Anka. But they deserve a well-written and thoughtful account and NOT a sloppy, poorly edited book.(P.S. I'm not a perfect writer and I'm sure my reviews contain errors.

But perhaps the title applies equally to their amazing mothers whose strength and determination to protect their unborn children was incredible.It is sobering to read again of the terrible experiences of the Jewish people during the second world war and distressing to say the least to read about the horrendous conditions in the Nazi camps. In Born Survivors, Wendy Holden first introduces us to each of the mothers Priska, Rachel and Anka as we learn of their lives prior to their internment in the camps. This book is clearly meticulously researched and their journeys to the camps, as well the terrible conditions endured while there, are vividly described. The inhumanity of the Nazi soldiers is evident and it is so important that people never forget what happened in these camps in the hope that the world never allows it to happen again. But what also shines through is the strength of the human spirit and the selflessness of some people to help others, even while in the depths of despair themselves.It is truly a miracle that first the mothers and then their babies survived against all the odds. It is also amazing that 65 years on, these three children all met and have found a sense of kinship. Their mothers did not meet in the camps and the children were unaware of each other, believing that no other babies born in the camp had survived. They were brought together through a website for The 11th Armored Division (The Thunderbolts) who had liberated the camp in May 1945. This is a remarkable story and despite the terrible events it recounts, it is completely compelling. Wendy Holden has written a superb account of a shocking time in the world's recent history in a very respectful way. It is a story of bravery, strength and love against a backdrop of fear and despair and I cannot recommend it highly enough."}, {"userName": "Carol Paur", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23743699-carol-paur", "userReview": "This book covers the experiences of three women that were pregnant at the time they were in concentration camps during Hitler's regime.

If found to be pregnant then - with a flick of Mengele\u2019s glove - the women would have been taken away to face certain death in the gas chambers. Born Survivors is the story of Priska, Rachel and Anka, three women who had never met but were transported to the camp late on during the war. The book tells the story of how at the beginning they believed they would be fine and survive, then as the Nazis moved in to their respective countries how they then tried to stay free from capture. All three young women were married by the time they entered Auschwitz that day in 1944. Little did they know what was to lie ahead for each of the three women and this is their story in a new book Born Survivors by Wendy Holden. All three women were pregnant as infamous trains transported them to be met by brutal SS guards with their ferocious guard dogs. During the coming hours they were stripped and their heads shaved before standing naked as Mengele went through the selection process. When each of the women were asked if they were pregnant they instinctively replied \u201cNein\u201d which saved them from the gas chambers. All three women who were separated from their husbands with no knowledge of their whereabouts were deemed fit for slave labour. None of them knew from one day to another whether they would face being selected for the gas chamber or work. This was just the beginning for each of the three women. Their food rations could only be described as dishwater and crumbs of bread. Living conditions deteriorated by the day as did their health. Priska, Rachel and Anka managed to hide their pregnancies from their fellow inmates, knowing if they were found they would face certain death at the hands of Nazi killing machine. The emaciated and lice-ridden women faced afurther ordeal as they were selected to help the German war machine by being transferred to Freiberg working as slave labours in a factory making parts for aircraft. During their time here the allies were advancing and bombing raids were daily, during which the women were locked in a room on the top floor of the factory while their Nazi captors hid in shelters. As their health deteriorated and being so thin the three women still managed to hide their secret. Rachel who shared a bunk with her sisters did not even dare tell them out of fear. Then on April 12 1945 Priska gave birth to Hana on a plank laid on a table. The Nazi captors even joked and had bets as to what the sex of the baby would be. With little food and water, the newborn was vastly underweight at 3 pounds. Then along with the other 1000 or so women they were evacuated from the factory as the Russians and Americans closed in. They were boarded onto trains with little or no food and water. How mother and baby survived on meagre rations living in rags at this time no-one knew. Nor did they know their destination with Allied bombing raids causing great confusion as bombs fell. Rachel weighing under 70lbs and in one of the crammed open coal wagons with little food and water she gave birth to a baby boy she named Mark. They were halfway through their 17 day journey in hellish conditions when she went into labour, with only a rusty blade to sever the umbilical cord. In hope of saving her baby she told her guards the baby was born on Hitler\u2019s birthday (April 20), so the SS guards joked \u2018another Jew for the Fuhrer\u2019. Their final destination was the infamous Mauthausen Camp (known as the Bone-Grinder) situated in Austria close to the Danube. This camp had the reputation of being the final destination - once through the gates you entered hell never to leave alive. Many in Mauthausen died from the appalling conditions including hard labour, lack of food, illness, being gassed or from the sheer brutality of the SS guards. It was on the final part of the journey to the camp that Anka gave birth to baby Eva on the back of a cart filled with the dead or dying women after being pulled off the train. The war was close to its end and the Allies were closing in on the Nazi regime and the hilltop camp. The guards herded many of the latest arrivals into the gas chambers only to realise they had run out of Zyklon B crystals used to gas those they wanted to kill. Within days the Americans arrived, spearheaded by the US Thunderbolts headed by Sgt Albert J. Kosiek a veteran of the Battle of the Bulge. A hardened soldier, he had seen and witnessed much but nothing could prepare him or his men for what they found at Mauthausen. Many of the men broke down when the sheer horror unfolded in front of their eyes. The war was finally over, Priska, Rachel and Anka though nothing more than skeletons had survived with their babies despite the horrors that they were born into. Born Survivors indeed. Many of the American servicemen who liberated the camp refused to speak of what they found at Mauthausen. The sheer horror would never leave them and would haunt them for the rest of their lives. The three mothers who defied death to give life were eventually allowed to leave and head home to try and find their husbands and rebuild their lives. Their journeys would end in heartbreak as their husbands were never to return and their homes and possessions all gone. Some of the women would be ostracised and had to move on to find a new home. Priska, Rachel and Anka are sadly no longer alive but their memory lives on in their children Hana, Mark and Eva, almost certainly the last living survivors of the Holocaust. Just very recently, on 10 May 2015, the Austrian authorities marked the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Mauthausen in the presence of relatives of survivors and those still alive who helped liberate the camp. Also present were Hana, Mark and Eva, celebrating the day the Americans arrived to set them free. The legacy of Priska, Rachel and Anka will live on through their children and their grandchildren and they deserve that. Born Survivors is a book of defiance, courage and hope. The author Wendy Holden deserves the plaudits for the painstaking research for this book and also the accolades that surely will come. For this reviewer I shed tears at the close of this book and the profound effect it has had on me. I for one will remember Priska, Rachel and Anka and their courage to defy death to bring life. I would like to thank both Wendy Holden and the publishers Sphere (Little, Brown Book Group) for giving me the opportunity of reviewing one of the most important and historically significant books of 2015. This is a book that deserves to be read.
