Willa\u2019s mother is famous for her brain and her father is just a regular guy. Of course she grew up with her dad and hasn\u2019t seen her mother in years, but that doesn\u2019t stop her mother from trying to dictate her academically. Willa agrees to attend Pembroke Prep, there she meets a girl who will change her life. Remy is the sort of girl everyone wants to be friends with. Remy chooses to befriend Willa and lets Willa into her world. Remy might be the only thing that keeps Willa from killing herself, but Remy has carved her own path to destruction.Right away I have to tell you that the writing style of this book is not normal. It took me some getting used to. It made me thing of the way some bloggers write. I enjoyed the style that speaks directly to the reader and includes backround info and snark. The writing allows us right into Willa\u2019s head in a very first person way. I think this is something you will love or hate right away, there is no getting around it. I liked being in Willa\u2019s head, so I pretty much enjoyed this story.That\u2019s not to say I didn\u2019t have issues. For example: right off the bat Willa is describing her classmates to us before she leaves for this elite prep school. She calls them horrible names like OCD, Peanut Allergy Boy, and Headhear girl. These people that she claims to miss aren\u2019t even important enough to have real names. There is fun play with names for everyone in this book, but I really disliked this intro. It gave me opinions about Willa that weren\u2019t necessarily true. Also, Willa admits to having suicidal plans, but we never really find out why.Willa and Remy have a magnetic attraction to each other. They are not lovers, but I almost though for a minute that they were going to be. Willa goes out of her way for Remy, and Remy opens up to Willa as much as she possibly can. Remy invited Willa into her world, but it is not all that pretty when you get a good look at it. Remy is very very much alone and recklessly not in check with anyone. This lifestyle means that no one will ever call her on her bullshit or tell her to stop. No one, not even Willa.There is a bit of a love interest, but\u2026 I thought right away, this is going to end badly. I admit that I disliked the ending. I can\u2019t really say where people ended up, but it makes me kinda sad to think about some aspects of this story. I think this book will appeal to a certain reader who like the way Willa sees the world."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7591340-sarah", "userReview": "(Source: I received a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis.

The way she kept going on about her haunted bathtub was quite annoying though.The storyline in this was about Willa going to a new school, freaking out over her haunted bathroom (which she wouldn\u2019t shut up about), and then finding a new friend called Remy, and starting to take illegal drugs. \n\n\u201cShe places one pink pill precisely on each of our tongues.

I haven't DNF'd a book before, and seeing this on my read section but not being completely read will tick me off one day. I'll probably power through this soon just to cease the anxiety, or give it away so I don't have to see it on the shelf at all.This was the most insufferable 15 pages I've ever read. I don't think I've ever hated a main character as much as this, even in such a short timespan with massive-ass text set at like Times New Roman 2, constantly treating the READER as a literal six year old being teased.The representation of mental illnesses is also one of the worst I've ever read. I have both OCD, and a severe peanut allergy. One of MC's friends (who has never been named because she seems to not give a fuck about them at all) called \"OCD\" is not given a description other than getting panic attacks if the condiment jars are out of place. My type of OCD is quite similar\u2014if certain objects don't have enough distance between each other, I won't be able to think clearly unless they're placed correctly apart. I only get severe anxiety when if they seem \"contaminated\" by being next to each other and I can't fix it. OCD boy can fix it. Move your arms to the middle of the table, you lucky bastard. And on another \"friend\", Peanut Allergy as called by our very loving MC, who is given this description on p.1-2:\n[...] is pretty low maintenance. And, honestly, Peanut Allergy Boy is, too. Other than the fact that you have to make sure there are no nuts anywhere near him, even pine nuts, seriously. If he eats nuts he'll blow up like a puffer fish and you'll have to stab him in the thigh with his EpiPen or he'll die.\n*sigh* I'm pretty sure if you have a severe peanut allergy you'd be weary about eating anything unfamiliar. I am. It's not clear if his allergy is triggered by skin-to-peanut as well, since this paragraph makes it seem he only gets it by eating.MC's wouldn't appreciate being called the exact same things they can't help.And then on page 16, MC mentions her father not being able to bring her to a gas station a bit outside town due to her throwing a tantrum and screaming, because there's a family of five with little to nothing in possessions and she just needs to help these poor people.The same girl who gives zero fucks about her friends and defines them only as the things they can't help, the things they are teased for.Yeah, nope.

Giving it three because it doesn't suit me well. Some parts I felt it was dragging and to be honest I was hoping for a better ending. There wasn't much a climax and a resolution, not to mention my ship sailed. I got this feeling that there wasn't any closure at all.What I like about the story is its loyalty to the story line and it's about and finding yourelf. The humor added is absolutely grea. And most specially, Willa's POV. She's funny effortlessly.Here's one that made me go Whoa! at Willa. Episodes like these are those I really enjoyed:This endless weight of being a human-type person on this spinning orb next to the sun in an infinite universe in a sea of the evermore infinite multiverse! ...idiot Neanderthals with the IQ of maybe a concrete block... And who can pull that off but Willa? I think I wanna use this someday, what do you think?Well, she's got it right in this part: ...this is really getting confusing. I sort of wish we could have name tags. Girlfriend or Not Girlfriend. Somebody hand me the right one.

This is my first book by this author.The narrator is 16 year old Willa from Iowa. She is leaving home to go to Pembroke Boarding School on the East Coast.The writing style is very odd. The narrator talks to the reader.I didn't really connect with a lot of the characters in this book. Many of the kids that go to this school are rich and snobby. They basically don't even have to attend classes if they don't feel like it. I was not expecting the book to be like it was. The way the narrator talks to the reader probably appeals to some people. But I found it annoying. Also, the way the narrator keeps mentioning killing herself was so unappealing.Willa meets a best friend, Remy. This girl is very rich and is big trouble. She introduces Willa to a lot of bad things, including drugs.This story really wasn't for me. I really did not connect with the writing style. I was expecting the book to be about a girl going away to school. I guess this is supposed to be realistic fiction if it is realistic to go to boarding school and do drugs with rich kids.I really enjoyed Ms. Ingall, one of Willa's teachers. It was really nice to see a teacher take such interest in a student. I also enjoyed a bunch of the places that Willa visited. Overall this book is a YA contemporary realistic fiction that might appeal to people who like to read about kids at boarding schools and their struggles.Thanks to edelweiss and HarperTeen for allowing me to read this book."}, {"userName": "\u2661Ann  Matalines\u2661", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18964623-ann-matalines", "userReview": "Warning: This book contains omigawd-she-didn\u2019t spectacle, and the other half is pretty familiar not to mention inconsistent."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14166925-melissa", "userReview": "Why is it always harder to write reviews about books you truly love? Nevertheless, I have to try. Because, you guys, The Fall of Butterflies is magnificent. And I encourage everyone in the world to run--yes, run--to the nearest bookstore--and yes, brick and mortar bookstore--and purchase a copy of this masterpiece. It will make you cry, it will make you laugh over and over again, it will make you feel understood. It will make you feel. And isn't that why we all read? Why we all live?Willa is the character that every editor and every reader dreams of. Her voice is strong and unique and unforgettable. She has the ability to laugh at and hide her pain with humor, but she still feels so much. Her glibness is both her protection and her savior; and she has this wonderful ability to critique her surroundings and society, and understand just how different people live in a way I think so many don't. I understand her and her struggles on a very personal level, and saw the same fears I experienced when I was in high school--and sometimes still feel. I was so worried she was going to fall down the rabbit hole of destruction with Remy, and I'm so unbelievably happy that she pulled herself back up. I could spend eighteen years piecing apart the psychology of Remy, but I'm not going to. Because this story isn't about Remy; it's about Willa. But I will say a few things. Like how I hate her, but also want to be her, and then hate her, but also idolize her, and then hate her some more. Which is how I'm supposed to feel. She's a complicated person, who both wants and doesn't want to be complicated. She wants to be seen and be the center of attention and be idolized, but she doesn't want to at the same time. She's a scared, lonely, wealthy girl that has the world at her fingertips, but she can't see beyond the shit. It was a painful car crash to watch. But written so damn well.I had a hard time liking the relationship between Remy and Willa, because you shouldn't. At it's core, this is a story about a toxic friendship. Remy unintentionally saved Willa from herself and her loneliness, which is wonderful, but that's about the only good thing that came from it. Okay, that's not totally true. Remy helped and allowed Willa to be herself (most of the time) and made Willa keep trying. But their relationship was rooted in unhealthy experiences, because Remy is an unhealthy girl. The relationship might feel important and change your life, but in the end, you can't help someone who doesn't want help or save someone who doesn't want to be saved. They drag you down, and after Willa learned how to be happy and accept herself on her own, she had to make the difficult decision of being by herself again. Please give Andrea Portes all of the awards for every category ever. Because she deserves them. The writing of this story is impeccable. Willa has the ability to examine society and crack pop culture jokes and make you feel because Andrea Portes wrote her. And I will be forever grateful."}, {"userName": "Cesar", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34467577-cesar", "userReview": "3.5 starsThere are lots of problems people have in the world. Many of them are different from certain groups or individuals. But the problem here in this book is: Rich People Problems.\nThe Fall of Butterflies\n isn't necessarily about rich people problems. It's still there, but it also focuses on Willa and her journey from being a girl from Iowa to attending an elite school and making friends with Remy. To me, this was a good book. It wasn't a book that took me by surprise. The best way I can describe this book is simply entertaining. Willa herself was a unique character who is someone who is just trying to find her place in the world.Aside from her journey, she also gets to go on these trips with her rich friends who seem to be unhappy with their affluent life. Willa wants to be one of the best and become \"somebody.\" But seeing her rich friends be unhappy with their lives is making her do a double take on what it means to have everything and be happy with it.I'd like to think the overall message of the book is that even if you have everything, even if you are one of the richest people in the world, it cannot make you happy. Sure money can buy happiness, but it cannot ensure lifetime happiness.In the case for Willa, she has to come to terms that life isn't something that can give free handouts to people who are in need. She didn't have everything when she was living in Iowa with her dad and she wanted something. But sometimes you just gotta role with the punches and go through life knowing that it won't be easy for you. And even if she does find that something, who knows if it'll make her feel happy or miserable. To be honest, it did sort of remind me of \nWe Were Liars\n be E. Lockhart with the whole rich people problems. Except \nThe Fall of Butterflies\n is a much better book mainly because Willa wasn't a whiny rich girl. At least in my opinion.In short, \nThe Fall of Butterflies\n was an entertaining book with a good message about happiness and what it means to be happy with your life. While the plot wasn't exactly well grounded and it did have it's moments, it was a good book overall.Thanks for reading my review!-Cesar"}, {"userName": "AH", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3255548-ah", "userReview": "About 3.5 stars (just because I had to put this book down and start over at a later date).Full disclosure - I'm definitely not the target demographic for this book. However, I do have teenage nieces who may or may not be interested in this book.....When I first started reading The Fall of Butterflies, I was a little bored. Same old story, teenage girl with an absentee parental unit plotting her own demise. I'll admit it, I put the book down for a bit and went on with my business. I picked up the book about a week later because I really enjoyed Ms. Portes' Anatomy of a Misfit.I then proceeded to read this book in one sitting. Why? I think that I was curious about Willa and Remi. Willa is a misfit from a town called What Cheer, Iowa and Remi is the queen of the social scene. The two hit it off, much to the chagrin of the other students at the prestigious Pembroke Prep School. Willa is shown an entirely different side of life. Beautiful clothes, huge mansions, private island parties, and designer drugs. She notices that some kids can miss classes for days and still graduate. Willa also learns that she has her own options and she does not need to follow her mother's path. The story is told through Willa's point of view and while she does have a wonderful sense of humor, at times I felt like she should have used some common sense.

I\u2019ve been in a contemporary mood, and this was the perfect book to satisfy my new habit of mood reading.I loved the writing. It\u2019s told in the second person, with Willa narrating to you as the reader. It was a fun and unique was to be pulled into the story, especially given the state of mind that Willa was in at the beginning of the story. It\u2019s like she is preparing us\u2026 for things to come.Willa has an unapologetic voice that I love reading. She comes off\u2026 rude, crass, and harsh at times, and there were even comments that would (and do) upset others, but it\u2019s the way she handles herself that makes me attracted to her personality. She feels alone, isolated, and watching her open up and find herself after befriending Remy was a magical experience, even though their relationship was toxic to the core. She grows a lot throughout the book and finds herself along the way. The themes throughout the novel are dark but well handled. It\u2019s not overdone but not too subtle, either.The Narration I thought Cassandra Campbell did a great job narrating Willa. Willa is far from a reliable narrator, and she was able to portray that in her voice. I also really liked how she handled Remy\u2019s voice, or all the characters, really. She doesn\u2019t have that too mature voice, either, which is great considering the age of the characters. I will be on the look out for more books narrated by her in the future!All in all \u2013 I really liked The Fall of Butterflies. It\u2019s a quick read (listen), with a dark undertone but such a great story of a girl finding her way. The ending is left pretty open, so that leaves us to fill in the rest of their story.

The cover of the book might make the reader think that it's going to be a fluffy contemporary where a girl falls in love and there's some dramatic moments wher they fight and stuff but for the most part, it's a fluff fest. Uhh, The Fall of Butterflies is definitely not a fluff fest; it's a strange little book with some pretty heavy topics in it. To cover a few: drugs, teacher student relations, parents and their affect on their children, etc.The book starts out kind of fluffy. Willa, our narrator, introduces herself as one of the most unpopular girls at her school and how she sits at a lunch table with the special ed. kids. She then tells us that her renowned economist mother got her into Pembroke Prep. She has a really young, quirky voice, riddled with bad jokes, hashtags, and text talk. It isn't overwhelming though, at least it wasn't for me. Her voice felt real for her age group, and the author retained this throughout the entire novel, so it was effective.Willa soon meets Remy, and that's when shit starts to turn darker. I know, I know, there are so many books out there that have a girl meet another girl and them have some sexual tension but them not actually be lesbians, and then one of the girls discovers the other one has a dark side. I KNOW. I don't know, this book just feels a tiny bit more fresh. There were some really weird scenes that literally made me make a cringe face.Of course there are things that could be cleaned up in this book. There are a couple of things that I'm still a little confused about or questioning, but I can't say them without spoiling some major aspects of the book. However, my expectations were pretty low but I'm coming out feeling that this book was enjoyable, and it was shocking.

Still, the author manages to lift the mood considerably by not really talking about Willa's intended suicide for the rest of the book and instead regaling us with the escapades and pranks that Willa and her new boarding school friends get up to. The plot is pretty good, although I could kind of see where it was going in terms of Remy's problems.I found it hard to actually identify with any of the characters, which was a bit of a hurdle for me as a reader. All the rich kids (like 90% of the characters) seem ultra-privileged, super-rich and don't have to go to classes if they don't want to. This was so utterly unlike my own high school experience that it just felt off-kilter. They got very tedious and I wanted Willa to tell them all (Remy especially) to bog off and when she didn't I wanted Willa to bog off for being just a doormat.While I really like Andrea Portes' style of writing (Anatomy of a Misfit remains one of the most emotionally-affecting books I've ever read) this one didn't hit the mark as well as I'd hoped"}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33740598-christine", "userReview": "WAY better than anatomy of a misfit.I guess I could relate to Willa, and that's what made this book so interesting to me.

I picked it up because I wanted to try to read outside of my normal genre and it bothers me that these books are not living up to my low expectations.This is the story of Willa and Remy, two girls who become amazing friends while at an ivy league high school. Willa has a mother that is famous for her brain, while her father is just a regular guy. Willa grew up with her father so he had a rather normal upbringing, except for when it came to what Willa did academically. That is when her mother kicked into gear and did her best to dictate what happen. Remy is the type of girl with an infectious personality, everyone just wants to be friends with her. Remy does Willa a favor when she befriends her and allows her into her crazy world. Each girl has their own demons to fight and this friendship really good for either of them?The first thing of note with this story is the writing style. It certainly will not be for everyone and if you stick with it, it will take some getting used to. The reader will either love it or hate it, no middle ground. Most of the writing can come across as if the author is talking to the reader like they are a three year old. It is almost demeaning at times.Almost right away, I started to immensely disliked Willa. She chooses to describe her classmates before even meeting them. How is that possible? However, when she does, she is HORRIBLE. She is rude, inconsiderate, insensitive, and hateful. She gives them terrible names like \u201cOCD\u201d, \u201cPeanut Allergy Boy\u201d, and \u201cHeadgear Girl\u201d. I could not figure out if the author wanted the reader to immediately hate this character or what her end game was. Actually, Willa\u2019s character is a void of anything solid and reasonable. She admits to being suicidal and having suicide plans, but the reader never finds out why she thinks this way. This is, quite possible, one of the worst written MCs ever.The intense and immediate attraction between Willa and Remy may lead the reader to believe they are lovers, but they are not. No idea why the author chose to include this as part of the story because it truly does not hold a place in the story. It serves nothing to the overall plot. Speaking of plot, I\u2019m not sure there is one. If there is, I wasn\u2019t able to find it.It is not hard to guess that I did not enjoy this book. I couldn\u2019t find anything redeeming about it. Willa\u2019s character is a horrible human being, and Remy is just bad news. These two are like a puddle of gas and an open flame. I would not recommend this to anyone. There are much better books out there and I would suggest you pass over this to get to them. That\u2019s why I gave this story 1.5 stars. The only thing that brought it up from just 1 star was I liked some of the places Willia visited and talked about.

I started reading it because I was in the mood for something contemporary and I remembered really enjoying Portes' previous YA title. I got SUCKED into this book and read almost 200 pages in one sitting. I was expecting a typical small town girl goes to expensive prep school and gets sucked into a new, exciting world, story butttttt this took an unexpected dark turn. And I loved it. I loved the characters and the way that Willa deals with the new life around her. She's curious (too curious at times) and willing to explore new things. But she's also very secure in who she is (despite her own feelings that she isn't) and knows when to put on the brakes.Willa's mother is a world famous economist who basically left her family to run off to France and peaced out of Willa's life. Willa lives in a small town in Iowa and she's not popular. She's very flippant about the small group of people she spends time with but clearly doesn't care about them at all. She's set to kill herself just because she's so sick of feeling her mother's expectations on her shoulders and when she moves to New England to attend an elite boarding school that her mother got her into.The only real problem I had with this book was that Willa talks about wanting to kill herself, but I never really felt like she had an actual reason why. She didn't seem depressed, she didn't seem suicidal, she just seemed done with life. Over it. And after she starts to sink into her new life that vein of story just kinda slowly falls away... it seemed a little odd to me.Other than that thought I loved the way that Willa comes to terms with her mother, with her father, with the life she left, and the new life she's leading. I loved watching those around her react to her and help her grow. I loved seeing her try so hard to save her new friend and coming to terms with the fact that sometimes you just can't help people who don't want it.I really love Portes' writing style too. It's very unique and quirky and fun to read. I liked that this story was being told to you (the reader) and that Willa is aware of you (the reader).

Remy finds Willa refreshing and decides that she can be her best friend.In the beginning I was excited. Willa tells the story directly to you, the reader, and speaks to you with her bizarre humor. When Remy came into the picture, my enthusiasm disappeared. Remy is a typical too-rich-for-her-own-good type who feels invisible to her rich family and pulls all kinds of tricks to get noticed. Milo is Willa\u2019s love interest, but from the beginning there is absolutely no spark. He is just another clich\u00e9 rich type.I did not understand what Willa found so fascinating about Remy and, to be honest, it was disappointing that to get better Willa needed a spoiled brat of a friend. I liked the writing, although there were moments Willa strayed from of the story, and the end was good, but otherwise I found this book really too clich\u00e9."}, {"userName": "Ms. Yingling", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2636606-ms-yingling", "userReview": "Kept reading this one because I wanted to know if Willa survives.

My first impression of this book was bad, but then as I got further and further into it, I slowly warmed up to it and started really liking it, though it still wasn't proving to be a great book. Then the ending blew me away and left me on that sort of happy cloud that I get to visit after reading really good books. A happy reading cloud? Is that what I should call it?I went from almost DNFing this to being wowed and I just have to laugh at the change. In a way, that made me even happier at the end because oh man, do I love a book that surprises me!The first couple chapters opens the book in an interesting way. The plot takes awhile to really start because there's this chunk where you're stuck in Willa's head as she just talks and talks and talks about both random and pertinent stuff. It was tough for me to get through because I just wanted her to GET TO THE POINT ALREADY. Once she befriends Remy, the plot picks up and more dialogue is added in. I do think it was important to show how random Willa could get--tangents, so many tangents--and to show how her thought process worked, but that didn't make me any less annoyed with her narrative in the beginning. I guess the \"stream of consciousness\" type of writing can be a hit or miss for me. It eventually worked for me, but I did get very close to DNFing before that happened.What I did always like about her POV was that she speaks directly to you, the reader. It's like those moments when comic books break the fourth wall or whatever (I don't really know much about it.) For example, there's a moment where she says how you are probably expecting the story to go a certain way, one that would typically happen in a movie; then she goes on to point out that things don't always work out that way or wrap up as cleanly as that.The story is a very dark-underbelly-of-the-young-and-rich type of thing. This girl from Iowa--apparently that just means she's from nowhere??--catches the attention of another girl whose mere presence seems to inspire awe from everyone around her. Girl-from-Iowa clings to this new and exciting friendship and feels oh so lucky and happier, but then the awe-inspiring girl says \"hey, you want to know my dark secret\" and starts showing all her cracks and faults as she introduces girl-from-Iowa to a rich, yet empty way of living. Okay, there's much more to it than that. Think of The Great Gatsby. It's like that. There's even a reference to the author, so I must be right with this comparison. Right?This book examines differences between small-town, middle-of-nowhere life and the big, ritzy, this-city-is-on-the-map sort of life, though more complicated than that. Willa is thrust into this new life and surrounded by people that use her Iowa background as a joke. (Oh, there's Iowa farm girl. That sort of thing.) They're the kind of people that are very privileged, but can't seem to be satisfied or happy with what they have. Part of Willa wants to be just like them, to be worthy of them, which is probably why she was so willing to do some things she normally wouldn't have done. At the same time, it's shown that this \"cultural difference\" (as described by Milo) makes a feeble excuse, like a way to point out bad behavior as something normal and therefore, totallyunderstandable. (It's not.) I really liked how the author dealt with these differences between Willa and the other characters. It's a big reason my mind changed so much about this book!Also, I got this subtle \"be grateful for what you have\" message and I adored that!As I got further into this book, I gained more appreciation for it. I got used to the writing and even started liking the fact that it was written that stream of conscious style (dialogue seriously helped). This isn't a simple book. Early on, I thought I had the book figured out. I thought I knew what type of plot it would continue to have and how the characters would affect one another. But I was surprised! This book takes some turns that I wasn't expecting, turns that felt a bit refreshing. The themes are more complicated than I initially thought. Even though I felt a bit too distanced from the story and didn't find everything executed as strongly as they could have, I really liked how the book snuck up on me and convinced me to like it.I also really liked how this book seemed to have many layers, which is reminding me of Anatomy of a Misfit. Both have this more-than-meets-the-eye (or more-than-initially-expected) quality to them that turns me into a very happy reader. (Again with the happy reading cloud.) Also, both are told in a way that makes them feel different from other books with similar stories and focusing on similar topics.And oh my, the ENDING. I have this urge to frame it because I loved the thoughts Willa closed her narrative with. It also made me realize just how much my mind had changed about the book. I never did feel connected to the characters, but I liked everything else more with time.Overall, The Fall of Butterflies provides a very interesting reading experience. I hesitate to recommend it because the experience can easily turn out more bad than good, but I still think more people should read it. I started out annoyed that the character wouldn't just get to the point, which is funny because now I'm loving that this book wasn't so straightforward. I don't think I would've read it in one day--while practically glued to Kindle--or would've written this lengthy (oh god, I'm like Willa) of a review if it just got to the point. It boggles that my mind that I grew to like the book so much, but I'm so, so happy that it did."}, {"userName": "Tara", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4650107-tara", "userReview": "This was an ok read, I enjoyed it but didn't really connect with the characters or the story.

So we have Willa from What Cheer, Iowa who has an awesome single dad and a strict famous economist mom that judges her life from a distance. She gets sent to Pembroke, an all girls boarding school, where she thinks she won't fit in until she meets the colorful, popular Remy. Remy introduces her to a fast and fun way of life, and Willa thinks everything is going just fine...until she learns that Remy's rich, exciting life comes with a cost. Characters...let's talk about Willa. She reminded me too much of the main protagonist from Me Before You: too quirky. I have nothing against quirkiness and a little weirdness, but she was all over the place and it almost seemed like the author was trying too hard to make her quirky/interesting. I found her annoying at times. Remy and Milo were interesting though destructive, dysfunctional, and deeply troubled. I didn't really like them; even though they had issues, they didn't seem to actually want to work through them? Maybe they were in the early coping stages. I don't know. The only character I genuinely liked was Zeb and I didn't even know that much about him (except that he's really cool and amazing). The writing style is conversational and short. It's just like Willa was recording her voice and decided to transcribe it exactly as she spoke. Lots of indentations, lots of short sentences or phrases. It's not my cup of tea and I was already irritated by Willa's narrative within the first twenty pages. However, Portes does an excellent job with making the story exciting and larger than life. I was instantly caught up in the excitement and whirlwind that is Remy. The characters are bold and wildly different, not to mention very dynamic. There is not a single moment of dullness or boredom, which I really appreciate. I was a little lost for words when I was done because it left me that exhilirated. She also does a good job of gradually easing into the story and no event seems to come out of nowhere for no particular reason. Another thing Portes does well is including serious issues. Drug abuse, substance abuse, suicides...this book isn't as lighthearted as it seems. And I think that's a theme for Portes's books (though I've only read Anatomy of a Misfit and The Fall of Butterflies); there is always darker issues underneath the friendship-is-great-yay-romance stories. I recommend this book for fans of Anatomy of a Misfit. I think Portes fans will enjoy this book more than Anatomy of a Misfit (I know I did) because it's more developed and has a better storyline in my humble opinion. I definitely see Portes's growth as a writer and I look forward to seeing how she progresses in her next novel. \u2740More reviews @ BlossomedBooks\u2740"}, {"userName": "Ryan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12885107-ryan", "userReview": "After I read Portes\u2019s first novel, I wasn\u2019t impressed. Honestly, The Fall of Butterflies wasn\u2019t that much better, but it was still an improvement. A four sentence summary:Willa leaves What Cheer, Iowa to attend the prestigious Pembroke Prep. Willa befriends the mysterious, quirky, school rebel Remy Taft. Willa and Remy get into trouble and do lots of drugs together. The end.Characters: I disliked every character in this book. I actually don\u2019t even think we were supposed to feel sympathetic towards them, but still. They were all annoying, spoiled, and rich. Willa did not sound like a teenager in today\u2019s world. She sounded like an adult trying to sound like a teenager. She went on tangents about the universe and ghosts and her big mouth. Pages and pages of nonsense that only ended giving me a headache. Remy and Willa had a case of instalove, even though they weren\u2019t dating. All of a sudden, they are best friends forever. This book follows the manic pixie dream girl trope. Willa basically worships Remy from the beginning, and towards the end of the story realizes Remy isn\u2019t all that she\u2019s cracked up to be, life lessons and yada, yada, yada. Romance: This book didn\u2019t really have much romance, but there was a main love interest for Willa, and his name was Milo. Milo was problematic from the start (hello, he wore camouflaged Vans). And I couldn\u2019t wait for their relationship to be over. Writing: They writing style was pretty cringe worthy. Again, going back to authors trying to sound like teenagers. The dialogue was awkward and definitely not realistic. Plot: I wasn\u2019t sure the direction this novel was taking. In a lot of ways it reminded me of \u201cLess Than Zero\u201d by Bret Easton Ellis (a book I recommend to absolutely no one). It was just a bunch of privileged, rich kids getting high and doing drugs. I just don\u2019t see the appeal in stories like this.And don\u2019t get me started on the ridiculous names. Willa! Remy! Milo! Zeb! Not every character in the story needs an eccentric name! I also didn\u2019t like how Willa kept talking to the reader for the first half of the book, and then towards the middle of the story she just stops that. This book kept me entertained, but I think it could have been executed better. With more developed characters/relationships and a stronger writing style, the story could have really shined. At the very least, I think this book will be relatable to a vast number of kids because of Remy and Willa\u2019s friendship. ."}, {"userName": "Tanja Voosen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5464546-tanja-voosen", "userReview": "Ich wusste nicht wirklich, was ich von dem Buch zu erwarten hatte.

Dann, dass das Buch eine LGBT Wende nimmt. Am Ende war die Story aber doch ganz anders, als ich mir erhofft hatte - nicht schlecht, aber auch nicht wirklich \u00fcberzeugend. Anatomy Of A Misfit war damals ein mega Gl\u00fccksgriff f\u00fcr mich, weil ich das Buch der Autorin klasse fand! Da stand fest, dass ich The Fall Of Butterflies auch lesen m\u00f6chte. Das habe ich bekommen: eine Story \u00fcber ein junges M\u00e4dchen, das seit dem Tod ihrer Mutter nicht mehr wei\u00df, wo ihr Platz in der Welt ist. Eine Story \u00fcber ein M\u00e4dchen, das neu an eine Schule kommt und eine gef\u00e4hrliche Freundin macht, denn Remy ist gerade dabei in einem Sumpf aus Desinteresse, Depressionen und auch Drogen zu versinken - ihr Image ist mehr Schein als Sein. So ist das Buch an vielen Ecken d\u00fcsterer gewesen, als gedacht und es sind auch einige Szenen involviert, wo die Protagonistin unter dem Druck ihrer neuen Freundschaft \"herum experimentiert\".Was ich sehr stark an dem Roman fand: er vermittelt auf eine sehr realistische Art und Weise, wie eine falsche Freundschaft einen zu Boden zwingen kann. Aber auch, wie abh\u00e4ngig man manchmal von anderen Menschen wird und das man dann die Notbremse ziehen sollte. Man kann das Buch sehr gut in zwei Parts unterteilen. Den Fun-Part, der von Humor nur so erf\u00fcllt ist und Willa von ihrer besten, sarkastischen Seite zeigt. Wie sie sich einlebt, mit ihrem neuen Leben an der Schule klar kommt und Sachen erlebt. Den No-Fun-Part, in dem Willa Remy in dunkle Abgr\u00fcnde folgt, merkw\u00fcrdige Liebesgeschichte inklusive.Nach wie vor wei\u00df ich nicht ganz, was ich vom Buch halten soll. Es hat mir auf verschiedenen Ebenen sehr gut gefallen und auch Willa mochte ich, allerdings schlich die Handlung oft ohne roten Faden vor sich hin und die ganze Sache mit Remy h\u00e4tte etwas besser thematisiert sein m\u00fcssen. Das Buch liest sich wie die Gef\u00fchls-Achterbahn, die Willa erlebt, was mich wohl auch bis zum Ende an die Seiten gefesselt hat.

An all-girls school on the east coast, it\u2019s a long train ride away from her loving and encouraging father in What Cheer, Iowa. She doesn\u2019t plan on staying there very long, and in that end, is encouraged to find that they have a rather tall bell tower.

So of course she\u2019s ecstatic about the switch to Pembroke. She\u2019s a driven perfectionist that hasn\u2019t realized that maybe she should have asked Willa what she wants and maybe shouldn\u2019t have ruined their family.Immediately, Willa draws the attention of Remy Taft (yes, that Taft family), a fellow student who becomes fast friends with Willa. Why, Willa has no idea, but it has caused their classmates to think Willa is not just some hick from Iowa. But being friends with Remy has a price, and Willa didn\u2019t come to Pembroke to complicate her life.Slowly, she gets drawn into a world of privilege and private islands and NYC high-rises where she discovers that maybe having everything you want isn\u2019t always the answer.I previously read Anatomy of a Misfit by the same author and remember it being deep with a layer of snark on top.

The book is written in first person, while occasionally breaking the fourth wall. The narrator is the main character, named Willa Parker, and because Willa is a teenager, the book is written the way a teenager might think or speak. Portes writes in a way that may be somewhat confusing to follow at times, but it adds to the realness of the mind of a teenager. She constantly adds witty, sarcastic remarks and goes off on anecdotes about herself or on whatever subject she is speaking about. The casual word choice makes me want to read more because it makes me feel like I am not just reading text off paper, but my reading my own train of thought. With the unique perspective and the interesting word choice, the writing style is definitely the highlight of The Fall of Butterflies.\tThis story is unique in some ways. The writing style is fairly unique because the story is told by the main character as they talk to the reader. Other than that though, it is a bit of a copycat storyline. Quirky girl moves, leaving her friends and having to make new friends to survive school. A very clich\u00e9 plot. There are also a few clich\u00e9 characters in the story. Remy is a girl that everyone wants to be friends with at her school, who eventually befriends Willa. She is a typical rich kid who doesn\u2019t get enough care and interest from her family, and will do anything to get some attention. Another example of typical characters are Willa\u2019s friends in the beginning of the story. They are the stereotypical misfits and nerds of her old school.

No, 11 million. Alternately sort of stream-of-consciousness and address directly to the reader, the effervescence of the prose ultimately makes the novel great, both in tossed-off lines that poke fun at YA descriptive conventions and establish a savagely smart narrator (\"She shrugs. I shrug. It's like a shrugging contest over here.\") and in the devastating establishment of the central character's mindset at war with itself, her funny takes on the world struggling to restrain her crushing self-hatred. The two combine to form a wholly unique narratorial experience, like Looking for Alaska meets Perks of Being a Wallflower. It's a good thing the voice is excellent, though, because it has to compensate for a very simplistic storyline. Past the compelling stakes of the opening, in which our central character wavers in her resolve to harm herself, the bulk of the plot concerning her prep-school friends goes exactly where you'd expect it to at every turn.
