The Bone Gatherer is an attention-grabbing story that pulls you right into a realm of the unknown, mystifying and most assuredly non-traditional lives of her characters. The charisma of her character is flawless. Yet again a sit on the edge of your seat; enthralling, can\u2019t put it down or wait to turn the page story. The book is filled with numerous situations to keep you enthralled. Thank goodness I have finally found a non-traditional author worth reading. It is rarely that I get involved in stories as I have with hers. I would highly recommend this book to everybody, no matter what your reading genre is."}, {"userName": "Alessandra Abate", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19063179-alessandra-abate", "userReview": "3rd time is a charm!!

She finds hidden rooms full of bones and powders used in Voodoo rituals, Kat communicates with the \"undead\" that have taken up residence in this century old historic house that exists on the edge of town. You will hold your breath and your passions will peak as Kat experiences several sexual encounters with the \"Bone Gatherer\" himself, and the local town Sheriff.Wow! The ending left me wondering...Have I ever met a Zombie? This is the third book I have read by Ms. Adele....looking for more."}, {"userName": "Garry E.", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12994079-garry-e", "userReview": "By Garry E.
