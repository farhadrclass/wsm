When I first received this book after winning a contest, I was so excited to read it as Robin was a Facebook friend, and I really wanted to know what type of writing she did. I started reading \"Love Never Ends\" and was immediately into the story which told me this was going to be a book that was a keeper. After reading farther I realized I had read it before and it had been a favorite then too!! I continued to read because I always re-read my favorite novels and it had been a while since I had read it. I fell in love with the story all over again!! I'm a romantic and the Story of Margo and Larson is such a complicated but romantic one, I found it hard to put the book down! Thank you Robin for telling such a romantic story about these wonderful people! I've read the second in the series No Strings and am eagerly waiting for the third in the series \"Building towards Forever!\""}, {"userName": "Crystal Marie", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14138637-crystal-marie", "userReview": "One thing I really enjoyed about this book was Robin was able to keep the suspense going as to why Margo left her husband and child. She was able to use the suspense enough that there was just the right amount happening. The character development was well done in my opinion; you could actually see the concern that the different family members had towards each other.\tMy one \u201ccomplaint\u201d about this book would be when Larson and Margo meet each other again. It was almost as though they were more about having sex with each other than talking first. Now don\u2019t get me wrong, I do completely understand true love, and how I would react if I saw mine after 16 years. But I would also have questions for them.\tBut besides that fact, I did enjoy this book. It was a very easy read, and I will be sure to check out the next book in the series when it is released. This is what I consider a rainy day read. It is happy romance, with just the right amount of drama and suspense in it."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22367402-susan", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book. It has a good mix of mystery, drama and romance and was well told. I thought Robin did an excellent job of bringing to life the feeling that 'love never ends' between Larson and Margo, as well as their daughter. I think we all dream of being blessed with a love like that.I'm looking forward to reading the second book in the series."}, {"userName": "Marilyn", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27184962-marilyn", "userReview": "GoodGoodthe story of how an intrtvering family member can cause a family to live a part.the mystery that brought them back to together."}], "description": "Larson Evans is a high powered attorney.
