I woke up in my tiny (494 sq ft) 1920s-era house in a walkable urban neighborhood. As I went outside to water my vegetable garden and take out the recycling, I saw my neighbor had returned my pie plate (I'd brought him the leftovers of my contribution to a pre-thanksgiving potluck) and also left me a mason jar of homemade spiked cider. Then I walked up the block to the coffee cart on the corner, where I got some organic pour-over coffee and homemade banana bread. By the time I got home, my taxi had arrived, so I loaded in my vintage 1970s carry-on that I got for a dollar at the Thursday Club rummage sale (a copy of McSweeney's Lucky Peach magazine in the side pocket) and went to the airport. I got on the plane, pulled out my iPad, and opened the eGalley of this book...which is all to say that 1) I am bougie as shit2) if anyone should be the proper audience for this book, it is meand 3) despite all that, by about page 8 all I wanted to say was: Shut up, Michael Pollan. Just. Shut. Up. *Disclaimer: I think Michael Pollan is great. I think slow food is great. I think local artisans and organic farms and healthy eating and sustainable everything and all of that is great. SO GREAT!! But I am tired of being told, okay? I GET IT. I was looking forward to a cool book about his experiences making pickles or whatever, not another rehash of the same old thing. People who don't know about this stuff already can just read The Omnivore's Dilemma. It's still in print."}, {"userName": "Petra X", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x", "userReview": "If you cannot trace your family back to immigrants or peasant stock then you are probably very well off and this book was certainly written for you. Otherwise.... read on!1. Michael Pollan is a clever man, and a cheerful one.2. MP does a lot of research.3. MP is very wordy because he wants you to know the he is a clever man who does a lot of research and is a cheery chappy, not a depressive old so-and-so who edits his work down to the bone,4. MP is very well off and thinks his readers are too and live in areas where there are lots of organic farms and farmers' markets because that's where he shops and you should too.I got so bored reading this very worthy book that I started to note down nuggets of wisdom, or at least interesting stories. From just a day of that I deduced that it was one interesting bit for five pages of MP going on being clever showing his research and just what a convivial, family man he was etc. It would have been really good cut down but then it would have been a bit thin.I do not agree with his premise that it was cooking meat that gave us a supply of more, easy to get calories that enabled our brains to grow and for us to become the brilliant humans we are. There are plenty of societies which are either vegetarian or only have meat rarely and they have the same size brains as the rest of us. Hunter gatherers in all parts of the world are not noted for being particularly thick and having only walnut-sized brains in their heads. The development of civilization is another strand of our humanity all together.______________In the real world most of us do not have access to farms that will butcher whole organically-raised cows and sell us just a pound of mince at a reasonable price. Farmers' markets trade on their names and the glow that goes along with the idea that everything is locally grown and free from pesticides unlike factory farm stuff you get in the supermarket, or at least so they say, but they also buy in from other farms who specialise in supplying farmers' market traders and might not be so fussy. . When you are paying a lot of money for organic food in the supermarket have you ever stopped to think it doesn't matter how it was grown, it was transported in crates in an open truck up and down the highway, lots of fumes for the produce to breathe in? Or that the organic apples and other stored items had been gassed to make them ripen more slowly, that the refrigerated items might also have been gassed and fresh produce is often wrapped in bags that slow deterioration by changing the chemical consitutents in the gas, air, that surrounds them?It's your choice who you support, but bathing in the warm glow of doing the best for your family by eating only locally-produced, non-transported organic food is only for the very well off who have a nice country home. Then they can poison themselves by commuting to the city for work.Rather than concentrating on organic and local, maybe the easier to manage whole foods rather than processed would keep us healthier, after all that's what our poor immigrant or peasant families once ate. Whole foods, not much meat, that being a treat, home-cooked with no preservatives, lots of exercise in the open air, and sleep. It worked for them, it must have or we wouldn't be around. I know we are longer-lived now, but that is due more to the advances of medicine than it is to increase in nutrition from our wonderful preservative, sugar and fat based diet."}, {"userName": "Carmen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen", "userReview": "Air elevates our food, in every sense, raises it from the earthbound subsistence of gruel to something so fundamentally transformed as to hint at human and even divine transcendence. Air lifts food up out of the the mud and so lifts us, dignifying both the food and its eaters. Surely it is no accident that Christ turned to bread to demonstrate his divinity; bread is partially inspired already, an everyday proof of the possibility of transcendence. Mmmmm-hmmmmm, sure, Michael Pollan. Doesn't this seem a little overwrought to you? A little... poetic? Listen, there are approximately a billion jillion food books out there. NOT COOKBOOKS. I'm not talking about cookbooks. I'm talking about \"Processed food is killing us!\" and \"Back to the earth!\" and\"I gave up my lucrative investment banker job to live on a small farm and raise goats!\" and\"My life has more meaning now that I raise chickens!\" and\"Local food is the key to immortality!\" etc. etc. etc. I read about 40 of these pre-GR. Animal, Vegetable, Miracle: A Year of Food Life, Still Life With Chickens: Starting Over in a House by the Sea, Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal, etc. etc. etc. And I was a little burned out.This is a food book. Just like all those other 80 food books you've read. Perhaps you haven't read any food books. If this is your first food book, you will think it is AMAZING! You will be like, \"OMG! How did I not know all this stuff before!!!! I must spread the word and save humanity!\"But if this is your 50th food book (like it is mine), you are going to be like, \"Uh-huh. I know all this already.\"That's mainly Michael Pollan's problem. And it's his own fault. After all, he wrote The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals in 2006. He could be considered one of the leaders of this kind of \"food book\" trend, or at least a \"food book\" bigwig. But the problem is EVERYONE is writing food books now and I am just food-booked-out. Pollan is bringing nothing new to the table with this. LOLIs he a good writer?Yeah, he's a good writer. Funny, a bit wordy, dropping family anecdotes and braving all sorts of things to learn how to roast, cook, bake, and ferment his own food....VIETNAM AND BARBECUE The book is divided into four parts:1.) FIREA quarter of this book is about barbecue. Pollan goes out to learn how to do \"real BBQ\" and hog-roasts. Actually, I found this section to be the most interesting because it's the only section where Pollan kind of touches on gender roles and race relations. I love talking about gender roles and race relations! Every time Pollan was like, \"In ancient Greece, women and slaves did most of the everyday cooking, but when the occasion called for a ritual meal, whether to mark the beginning or conclusion of a military campaign, or the arrival of an honored guest, or a day otherwise made large by history, the men performed the honors. my ears would prick up. \"Tell me more about this!\" I would beg Pollan, only to have him start telling me all about a pit-master named Ed who thinks he's the second coming of BBQ, or something. Food is an area fraught with peril for feminists. My dear friend is a strong feminist, and she loves to cook. She is a wonderful cook. No one at work knows she can cook. She is afraid that if they find out she can cook, they will want her to bring stuff to work potlucks etc. She grew up watching girls in class bring everyone cookies, ya know what I'm saying? And she knows the men stay seated after a meeting while the females get up and clear the dishes. She doesn't clear the fucking dishes. If the men stay seated, she also stays seated.Hmmmmm, I totally admire her and relate to this. On the other hand, I think it's sad that her love of cooking is such a huge secret and something she feels she needs to hide. We still have a bit to go, I think, re: equality.Or when Pollan would start saying, \"It seems to me that authentic whole-hog barbecue is not something you ever want to pay someone to do by the hour. In fact, it's hard to imagine that this method of cooking, which demands so much more time than effort, would ever have taken root in a society where wage labor was the norm. The rhythms of barbecue are much better suited to the premodern economics of sharecropping or slavery. Such an economy, combined with the heat, helped make a certain slowness - as much as pork or wood smoke - a key ingredient in Southern cooking, and Southern culture more generally.\" Wow, really? I want to talk about this more! But no, Pollan leaves that to talk about crackling or something. \"Food,\" Edge told me, \"is one of the ways the South is working through its race quandaries.\" Or what about this, I loved this: \"Only two things in my experience have had the power to transcend race: Vietnam and barbecue.\"What about when he talks about the raw food movement, ...humans don't do well on raw food: They can't maintain their body weight, and half of the women on a raw-food regimen stop menstruating. WOW. So fascinating. I have friends who are/have been raw foodists, and indeed, a lot of females got amenorrhea. Word up. Also, it gets complicated when/if you want to have children. Not only the amenorrhea! But whether to try and put kids on a raw food diet after they are weaned. But there is just ONE PARAGRAPH in the whole book about raw foodists.The other three sections are not even as interesting, and note that I'm saying \"interesting\" as Pollan is throwing me one sentence here, one sentence there, a paragraph over there. Sigh.2.) WATERPollan learns how to cook. Stews, soups, braises,... Pollan is taught by a Iranian woman named Samin.3.) AIRPollan learns how to bake bread from a bunch of different males.4.) EARTHPollan learns how to to make sauerkraut, kimchi, cheese, and beer. I love when he talks about cheese and sex....MAIN MESSAGES OF THE BOOK:1.) Cooking is what makes us human.2.) Bacteria are our friends....ME:Well, both my mother and father cooked. And baked. They both were excellent cooks and bakers. There was no \"women cook and bake, men don't\" thinking in our house. Both my mother and father prided themselves on their excellent meals.I was very lucky. We made almost everything from scratch. We lived in a house where dad or mom would frequently admonish: \"Walk softly - the bread's in the oven.\" When I went over to a friend's house and saw them put a frozen pizza in the oven it was like o.O stepping into a different world for me. Same for my friends. When I invited them over after school for macaroni and cheese, I think they were expecting a neon-colored Kraft concoction, not for me to start mixing up a roux over the stove.As a result, I cook and bake. All my siblings (male and female) cook and bake. We think nothing of making homemade vegetable soup, homemade chili, homemade lasagna, we cook beans and rice, we whip up a roux or a sofrito/mirepoix. We bake bread. We bake cookies and pies. We make pizza from scratch (waiting patiently for the dough to rise). Homemade, from-scratch cinnamon rolls (heaven!!!). Quiche. I am blessed. Cooking/Baking is one of the best gifts my parents ever gave me.However - you CAN pull yourself up by your bootstraps. My friend who was from one of those \"frozen pizza, boxed dinner\" families really wanted to learn to cook. I started to teach her. She was a horrible cook. Horrible. LOL She moved away to get her own place and I was unable to see her as frequently. I thought that she'd give up trying to cook and bake and revert to her family's teaching of eating out and microwaving. I was WRONG. I'm telling you - now, years and years later, - she is an AMAZING cook and baker. She cooks and bakes for and with her boyfriend and friends all the time. She throws wonderful dinner parties. She really taught herself and through trial and error became a wonderful cook.That's what Pollan is doing here - going from someone who ate frozen ravioli to someone who spends the weekends chopping vegetables and making delicious stews, kimchi, and bread....Tl;dr - I liked this book. The best parts were when Pollan was talking about sex, gender, and race. That's probably just my preference, though. I also like when he talks about being Jewish, not keeping kosher, Christ and the Bible, and how bacteria may help with HIV and autism. This is very infrequent, though. Mostly he's talking about cooking, baking, chemistry, heat, etc. etc. The writing is good, if a little wordy at times. Overall, a worthwhile read.P.S. There are recipes in the back.ETA: May 11, 2015BAKING BREAD IS NOT DIFFICULT.Just yesterday I made two loaves of rye with caraway seeds by hand from scratch. Easy. Simple.This book makes it seem like making bread is complicated. Or that you need a \"baker tutor\" to show you how it's done, or something.Yes, it is easier if someone shows you the first time, but it isn't a big deal.If you are thinking about baking bread, or attempting to bake bread for the first time, just go for it! I'm here to tell you that it is not scary or difficult. *nod nod*"}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2418516-jessica", "userReview": "This is less a review of the book and more a response to other people's critiques of 'Cooked'.Anyone who tells you that this book is simply a rehash of 'The Omnivore's Dilemma' never made it past the second page.Having read 'Second Nature', 'Botany of Desire', 'The Omnivore's Dilemma' and 'In Defense of Food' (in that order), 'Cooked' reads much less like he is treading old ground and more like he is building on previous themes. One could argue that 'In Defense of Food' and 'Food Rules' are both a little too close to 'Dilemma' and were perhaps capitalizing on the then trendy subject of food politics. But 'Cooked' certainly is not, instead it does exactly what the dust jacket tells you it is going to do, it invites you into Pollan's kitchen while he experiments with and muses on dinner.And as a woman and a feminist, I didn't find a single thing in the second chapter (which tackles gender stereotypes in the kitchen) remotely sexist or anti-feminist. If a reader finds anything he says about either the feminist movement or the need for someone in the household to return to the kitchen offensive, they are surely looking for a bone to pick and consequently are doing only a cursory reading.Right now if you plug Pollan's name into Google you come up with a lot of splashy headlines: 'Is Michael Pollan a Sexist Pig?' 'Why Does Michael Pollan Romanticize Dinner?' and 'Why Does Michael Pollan Think Cooking Is an Escape From Corporations?'. Most of these articles concede that 'Cooked' is really a good book, a fun read, maybe a little flawed, but essentially on the same side as the authors of the previously named articles. Then why the attention grabbing headlines? Perhaps because it is easier to tear apart something that is both good and popular in order to ride it's coat tails than come up with something new. Or perhaps it is becoming 'uncool' to like Michael Pollan as he and his views are gathering a mainstream following.'Cooked' is a good book, a fun read. It left me with the drive to get back in my garden, return to baking bread, maybe even take up cheese making. I learned a lot about the science of cooking. Pollan has a particular gift to take scientific material and translate it for the layman. The overly critical backlash against it should not keep anyone from picking it up and enjoying it."}, {"userName": "Judy", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3131238-judy", "userReview": "The title, Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation, says it all. Pollan takes the reader on a food trek: a limited historical account, his own account of transformation into a better cook plus documentation of how processing has transformed the foods of the world. I hesitantly picked this book up, afraid that it would be dehydrated, monotonous detailing of the history of food. No bologna! that is not the case. Pollan dishes up a nicely seasoned balance of his own personal story, food industry chatter and history. My fear of the history being ladled on too heavy was unwarranted. Here are a few items that I savored:*The book is sliced into 4 sections: Fire (barbecue); Water (art of braising); Air (breadmaking -think, air bubbles in bread) and lastly, Earth (fermentation). I appreciated the additional focus of cooking coming from basic elements.*Personal stories, well-documented information, variety - The Ed Mitchell and Chad Robertson scoops were personal favorites. For each category (Fire, Water, Air & Earth), Pollan tried to line up a training session with an expert on whatever he was preparing.*Quality of writing - I don't know if just any author could have made this as tasty. Pollan does have the right credentials and skills to bring this account to a pleasant slow-simmer. Although, I enjoyed reading this book, I did find the sections I related to most, sizzled most for me. My tastebuds weren't tantalized as much by the last section involving fermentation because its not something I've tried before or had much interest in attempting. But overall, well-done and I have taken away a few tips to improve my own culinary skills. Not to mention, I now know that there is a 5th taste we can sense in addition to salty, sour, bitter and sweet...Four succulent stars****"}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1921076-katie", "userReview": "I wanted to love this book so badly and there are definite 5-star parts to it, but there are also 1-star parts. Parts that I, admittedly, skimmed through. I suppose that is to be expected in a book covering so many topics. The book is divided into 4 parts - earth, air, fire, and water - and I while I understand and can see the appeal of this, I oftentimes felt that the connections were tenuous, at best. For example, there is an obvious connection between roasting a pig and fire. However, the inclusion of alcohol fermentation in the \"air\" section felt really obtuse. I get that yeast is in the air, but....it felt contrived.Part 1: Fire. OH MY GOD, if you can read these 100 pages and not want to go out and roast a pig in your backyard, or at the very least, drive down to the south for some authentic barbecue, then you should not read this book, because you don't love food. I loved the writing; I could almost taste and feel the barbecued pig while reading. Part 2: Water. Simple braises are my MO in the kitchen, but I never realized how much temperature and cooking times can alter the flavor of a simple miripoix (carrots, onion, celery). I loved the focus on flavors and how to bring those out with different techniques.Part 3: Air. I didn't love this chapter at all. In fact, I almost skipped the last 75 page of it completely, but I skimmed them. I don't eat bread, but I was fascinated by the focus on biology and what is going on when yeast combine with sugar and create those delicate little pockets of yeasty goodness. I worked at a bakery for years in high school, so that scent will always be with me.Part 4: Earth. This was all about fermentation. I own and have read The Art of Fermentation and Wild Fermentation, and I am a regular vegetable pickler. However, I am more inclined to do the quick vinegar pickle which I was reminded isn't \"real\" pickling. I was inspired to get some veggies at the store to begin some real adventures in fermenting. I was not, however inspired to start fermenting beer. I'll leave that to the experts because some things are better as mysteries.Overall, it was a good book, but much too long. I loved the biology and nerdy science parts; I think this is where Pollan's writing and attention to detail really excel. The history parts were interesting, and I read those sections with some interest. However, I found myself rolling my eyes and getting very annoyed during the far-too-long sections about philosophy/religion. Maybe that's just the scientist in me coming out."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david", "userReview": "In Michael Pollan's latest book about food, he takes the reader on a personal journey as he learns first-hand about four different types of cooking. First, he takes a trip to the North Carolina, where he learns how to cook barbecue from a pit master. Pollan volunteers his time, and learns the subtleties of cooking a barbecue, and these subtleties are described in detail. Perhaps, a bit too much detail for my taste.Then Pollan describes the art of making sourdough bread. In great detail. One very interesting factoid is that one can live off of bread, but the nutrition in flour alone is insufficient to sustain life. Pollan describes the chemical reactions involved in the making of bread, and it is these chemical reactions that are necessary to generate sufficient nutrition for living.The book also goes into detail about fermented foods, especially cheese. He visits Mother Noella, the \"Cheese Nun\" who has a PhD in microbiology. She has used her understanding of chemistry, biology, and bacteria to perfect the making of cheese. A lot of evidence is cited, about the healthfulness of fermented foods. I found a new respect for fermented foods, and especially my favorite; pickles.I am a vegan, so the sections on barbecue and making cheese are not exactly enticements to try cooking or eating these foods. Nevertheless, Pollan manages to make it all interesting to me, as he brings the master cooks to life.There are no recipes in this book. While you cannot learn how to cook from this book, you can gain some insight into why cooking helps make us human. The book is an argument for taking the time to cook, instead of heating up pre-cooked dinners. Parts of the book wax poetic about the art of cooking, and about the people who have mastered the art of specialty cooking."}, {"userName": "Shelby *trains flying monkeys*", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1053760-shelby-trains-flying-monkeys", "userReview": "Michael Pollan is one of my very favorited people.

In _Cooked_, he turns his attention to the four elements of cooking -- fire, air, earth, and water- -- and gives the reader a new look into the western food culture. The book is not only food memoir but also a heavy dose of philosophy, literary studies, history, and anthropology as Pollan illustrates the tangled cultural web of the food we eat.

After reading this book, I had an uncontrollable urge to bake bread (hello whole wheat hamburger buns!) and start fermenting my own cucumbers.I picked this up at the library because of the title. I had never read a book by Michael Pollan, I had no idea he was one of Time magazines most influential people of the year back in 2010. Now I can see why. He certainly influenced me.This is a well written book. Even if a person disagreed with him on matters of diet, he is a master of words and I hated having to put the book down. I'm sad it's over. I need more Michael Pollan!He discusses cooking with all the elements - Fire, Water, Air, Earth.Fire - BBQ. Authentic southern barbecue, made from the whole hog. Not much a BBQ fan myself, I was salivating reading through this section. It's not just about the joys of eating real food prepared slowly, it's also a social commentary with questions raised about the ethics of hog farms. It makes you think.Water - Stews, Soups, Braises. This section was interesting, but I didn't become inspired to learn to make soffritto. It did make me want to spend more time in the kitchen, though.Air - This was THE chapter. Bread. Bread made from wild yeast. I learned so much about sourdough starters and bacteria and yeast. I learned about wheat. I learned what we have done to our wheat. I learned how humans have evolved with wheat and the relationship we have to yeast. I just can't buy a processed bread product now. (I'm sure I'll eventually have to, but hopefully, not as much as I have been.)Earth - Fermentation. Alcohol. Pickling naturally, without vinegar. I had no idea how hip and trendy fermenting is right now. It sounds earthy and fun. Yes, I'm a little leery of the microbes, but I think I'll steer clear of corning my own beef or making my own sausages (which wasn't touched in this book, but it was discussed in another book I read). Wine. Beer. Cheese. I had to go eat olives with seeds and good cheese and drink wine after this section. I learned about bacteria in our gut and how different studies are showing some very interesting things about our evolution with alcohol and fermented foods.If I could, I'd change my entire diet right now. But I can't - some of this takes too much time, some of this costs too much money. And for some things, I just don't think I've the patience or the talent. But it started me thinking.

The best I'd been able to come up with was the thought that each individual sentence had too much B\u00e9arnaise sauce, which meant I could not read it in my preferred fashion -- which is basically to lock myself in a room for three days and read it straight through. At a certain point, the complexity of Pollan's sentences started to make my eyes glaze over. Of course, one could argue that Pollan did not intend this book to be read in three days straight, that he wanted it to be -- well -- savored. That perhaps my inability to appreciate this book owed more to my inadequacies as a reader than to Pollan's inadequacies as a writer.Nonetheless, when I finally finished the last intricately fashioned sentence in Cooked, I wanted to book the first flight to Oakland, hop on Bart, get off in Berkeley, hunt down Michael Pollan's house, show up in his kitchen, and bitch slap him.For one thing, the central conceit of the book -- four elements corresponding to four styles of food preparation -- felt contrived. Yes, yes -- definite connection between fire and bbq, but baking bread and air? That's reaching.I do totally agree with most of Pollan's conclusions about the relationship between food preparation and various dysfunctional elements in today's society, particularly the bits about the Insidious Microwave and how it splinters family dinners, which are the only times that most families have the opportunity to bond.I suppose if I were editing Pollan, I'd recommend tuning down the articulation several notches. Making his sentences simpler and more direct: SUBJECT-VERB-OBJECT (period.) SUBJECT-VERB-OBJECT (period.) Framing the long, intricate sentences in simpler verbiage, perhaps with a ratio of 5:1. I think it would make this book considerably more readable."}, {"userName": "Crystal Starr Light", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3990525-crystal-starr-light", "userReview": "Bullet Review:I didn't like it as much as The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals. And that's really what it boils down to in a sentence. Since I rated TOD 4 stars, this gets 3 stars to differentiate (though it ranks better than the other 3 stars it's grouped with - damned rating systems!).Some general problems:+ The tenuous relationship each element has to the supposed cooking method. Fire = barbecue, for sure, but fire is also critical in boiling and, duh, baking. Pollan spends a lot of time and effort on sourdough bread in the baking section, but making the sourdough starter requires fermentation, which is under earth.+ I don't recall TOD being this wordy. The sentences here are SO LONG, and listening on audiobook meant, I would wait forever in the car for Pollan to get to the end of a sentence.+ Michael Pollan made a decent narrator, though LOL at some of his pronunciations. Coolinary for \"culinary\"? LOL.+ I found myself drifting off numerous times as Pollan goes into great depths about fermentation and broiling and such. In fact, pretty much the entire Earth/Fermentation section was a bust for me (much like Hunting/Foraging was in TOD), which is a shame because BEER AND CHEESE PEEPS.As 3 star ratings go, this is a high 3 stars, but still, it wasn't as enjoyable or insightful as TOD. And it just makes me more upset (OKAY JEALOUS) that I don't have the time or skill to bake every other night or spend all of Sunday chopping onions as Pollan does."}, {"userName": "Nathaniel Moger", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16021747-nathaniel-moger", "userReview": "This was an awesome read, and well worth the effort to borrow and devour.Michael Pollan took a lesson from his last book - that if you eat whatever you make with your own two hands, you will be healthy - and applied it. Here, he takes the four elements of fire, water, air, and earth, and cooks four types of food with those elements. For fire, he apprenticed himself with a Carolina barbecue pit master. In the water section, he learned to braise from an Iranian immigrant who worked at Chez Panisse. Then he learned to bake bread from the owner of Tartine as a way to understand how to cook with hot air, and lastly he learned to pickle veggies and brew beer as a way of using the bacterias in earth to transform food.At it's core, this book is an optimistic look at how cooking enriches not just our health, but our relationships with friends, loved ones, and strangers. There are parts of the book where he paints a scary picture of the food world we live in (in a rehashing of the basic principles of \"In Defense of Food\"), like how KFC marketed buckets of chicken as a second-wave feminism solution to the division of labor in American households, or how most Southern barbecue joints are owned by white men that underpay black pit masters to do the heavy lifting. But this book focuses more on how cooking heals than on how the lack of it hurts. It's hard not to smile a little when he describes having his best conversations with his teenage son Isaac while chopping vegetables because teenagers hate having real, face-to-face conversations, or how they spent quality father-son time brewing beer because the illicitness of the activity piqued Isaac's interest.

The first chapters are a bit off-putting- a bit too much philosophy, but starting with the chapter \"Fire\" I had a difficult time putting the book down. Food is such a complex part of our life- we need it, it takes our precious time to prepare it, if we choose the wrong food it can make us fat and unhealthy and yet...Food preparation is a sensuous , zen-like necessary art. I'm not much of a meat eater, but Fire was something i wanted my husband to read. Water, Air and Earth made we want to try everything- except maybe cheese making- which I will leave to the more adventurous. I gained a new appreciation for the historical, biological, psychological, and sociological import of food. I have a new appreciation for sauerkraut and kimchi and pickles. I am reminded that we Americans are making vast waste lands of our bodies by over sanitizing and industrial processing of our food.

I also love and health, growing my own veggies and cooking healthy meals. So I\u2019ve been a huge Pollan fan since 2006, when my sister-in-law brought me The Omnivore's Dilemma for Christmas. Pollan hits on all cylinders.He\u2019s a cultural critic, but unlike most cultural critics, his lense is food, not literature or pop-culture TV. movies or music, which makes him unique. He\u2019s a food writer that doesn\u2019t obsess about creating Michelin 5-star ingredients and esoteric food prep techniques, or present Bitman-esque reams of minimalist recipes. Instead, Pollan uses his bully-pulpit to dissect the negative impact that industrial food companies have had on the health of Westerners. And that impact\u2019s been horrible:increases in obesity, diabetes, the risk of heart disease, stroke, cancer, etc. He\u2019s also scientific in his approach, citing research, but unlike many a science or pop-diet writers, refuses to take the easy, reductionist answer. He doesn\u2019t focus on single-elements of a diet (like the Atkins \u2018kill the carbs, eat meat\u2019 nonsense). Not does he jump on the \u201csuperfoods\u201d bandwagon, saying we should all eat kale (or whatever the superfood of the moment is) every day for breakfast, lunch and dinners. And he scoffs at things like the \u201cpaleo diet,\u201d a marketing ploy that\u2019s a quixotic tilting at wind turbines in the 21st century. In fact, he\u2019s the only new agey type guru I know of who advises AGAINST taking dietary supplements, whether vitamins, minerals or extracted nutrients .To Pollan, the good nutrition is more than a sum of vitamins, minerals and phytochemicals. Instead, whole foods create a holistic system that exploits our evolutionary machinery for turning foodstuffs into health. Due to ancillary phytochemicals, minerals, etc, a real apple contains, your body extracts more useable vitamin C from it than it can from a vitamin C tablet. Which is why he advocates eating diets of real, whole foods for optimal health. Cooked continues Pollan\u2019s top-shelf bibliography. In it, he traces four ways that humans cook food: fire, water, air and earth.  He starts with fire, apprenticing himself to a big-talking North Carolina pitmaster. There, he notes the Homeric and biblical similarities our modern barbeques, especially communal pig roasts, to their ancient cousins. Both are open-air, male-centric, extroverted celebrations of a successful hunt. He then moves onto the element water, where he learns to braise meats and stews in closed, domestic vessels. This practice is introverted, hearth-bound and feminine, but responsible for our most tasty, cherished and economical of dishes. After tackling the big-two, the books rambles into the truly interesting\u2026 at least for me, since I seldom visit these realms. For the element air, Pollan learns the skills of artisan breadmaking. It turns out that there\u2019s more to making bread than dumping yeast into a flour dough. In fact, for master-bakers, it\u2019s an obsession that has them bringing their sourdough \u201cstarters,\u201d a living culture of yeast and bacteria which give sourdough bread its unique taste, with them to the movies so they can \u201cfeed\u201d the starter on schedule. Obsessive, for sure, but the results a tasty, often peerless loaf. And then Pollan takes you into earth, the world of fermented food products. Pollan makes clear that fermentation is controlled rot. Think cabbage. But not the store-bought variety, often desiccated cabbage soured with vinegar, but how they make kraut in the old world. Shred the cabbage, put it in an airtight pot and let the bacteria present on the cabbage itself rot the cabbage to produce sauerkraut. Pollan\u2019s \u201cteachers of rot\u201d include a half-cracked HIV-positive prophet of ingesting live bacteria named Sandor Katz, to a Catholic nun with a PhD in biochemistry who makes a traditional smelly-as-unwashed-feet French cheese for her convent. Pollan finishes playing basement brewmaster, lending an appreciation to the complexities of fermenting alcohol. As always with Pollan, Cooked left me amazed by the breadth and depth of his insights. He\u2019ll quote Nietzche, a contemporary archaeologist, a down-home pitmaster and then a scientific study on the health benefits of a whole food diet within the same page. Odd bedfellows, but Pollan has the knack for making the disparate hang together. Like a good cultural critic, he connects readers to heretofore unrealized deep traditions that hide in plain sight. Like a good food writer, he focuses on the artful preparation of food and understanding it\u2019s histories. And like a top-flight science/ health writer, he highlights evidenced-based strategies we all can use to live healthier lives. A rare, page-turner of a non-fiction book.

It's true that this book goes into the specifics of four elements in cooking, but in each he spends considerable time on background and related topics. I'm not sure I should have listened to the audio because when it started to get repetitive I couldn't skim like I would in the print. I just had to take my time listening, which can be hard with a 3 mile commute, but I definitely learned some things. And man did this book make me hungry. It also made me want to go back to my baking projects like working through The Bread Baker's Apprentice: Mastering the Art of Extraordinary Bread and rejoining the Baking with Julia: Sift, Knead, Flute, Flour, And Savor... bake-along group. I do miss that intentional, multiple versions of a recipe until you get it right, process. I used to learn so much during that time.I was surprised that Michael Pollan wasn't more of a cook to start out with, considering that he tends to write almost entirely about food. At the same time, he was working with absolute experts on barbecue, bread baking, and fermentation (the pot-on-the-stove section was a bit of a stretch). He brings in information about anthropology, ethics, and public health. There is something for everyone.Despite my complaints of not being able to skim, I enjoyed the author's reading of his own work. He has a pleasant and interested voice, and this is clearly a subject that he is still interested in now, even after spending all this time on it. This will be a nice addition to our university library, because we have a wide spectrum of courses that touch on food.

I'm absolutely stuffed. Bugger off.Maitre D: Oh sir, just... just *one*...Mr Creosote: Oh all right.

I'll never forget the discussions with the nun about the erotic implications of disgust and cheese. Pollan obviously has a political agenda, but I never felt that I was being preached to. His personal anecdotes and gentle criticism of the more loony opinions of those he interviewed were warm and sympathetic and got me onside.The structure of this book is a bit contrived- It's more like having the Stephen Fry of food over as a dinner guest - the conversation flies all over the place - History, Culture, Homer, Organic Chemistry, Evolutionary Biology, Politics, Ethics, God, Drugs, Slavery.... you really never know where he's going to take you next and that's part of the joy of it. After a while he even pokes fun at the books conceit of being organised into Fire, Water, Air and Earth (The drunken beer chapter characters point out beer uses all 4).In the introduction he does apologize for perpetuating some stereotypes - and if he hadn't pointed this out I probably would have been a bit more critical of the western bias in this book... but it is what it is, and it certainly rambles over a lot of topics and gets its point across.One on the best non fictions I've read in a while - and a lot to think about."}, {"userName": "Sharmila Mukherjee", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18484136-sharmila-mukherjee", "userReview": "In \u201cCooked,\u201d Pollan returns to the multi-part, nature-meets-culture narrative style of his previous books, \u201cThe Botany of Desire\u201d and \u201cThe Omnivore\u2019s Dilemma.\u201d Each section of the book tells of Pollan\u2019s efforts to master a recipe using one of the four elements: fire, water, air, and earth.

That book casually tossed upon my table the relationship humans have with plants, and reciprocally the relationship they seem to have developed with us. It sounded vaguely alien-esque, so I went off into the void of two of my favorite reading genres: food and sci-fi. It was followed by a succession of other Pollan books through the years, each with the promise of keeping my foodie mind burbling with anticipation.When \u201cCooked: A Natural History of Transformation\u201d first arrived on the shelves, I instantly bought it with intention to consume it over a few long weekends. As it so often happens, life got in the way and the hardcover with its tempting penne immersion image languished on my bed stand.Then a month or so ago my employer, The Michigan Land Use Institute, started a new initiative, \u201cThe Bob Russell Resilience Reading Project.\u201d The project honors the memory of a community luminary and his gift to us of a carefully curated reading list he believed could help change the world. \u201cCooked\u201d is the first book selected for the project.If you\u2019ve read Pollan\u2019s other books, this one arrives a bit off-camber. It\u2019s not the same rip-out-the-heart, traditional food system skewering we\u2019re used to. \u201cCooked\u201d starts with a frank admission from Pollan: \u201cCooking has always been a part of my life, but more like the furniture than an object of scrutiny, much less a passion.\u201d What he\u2019s saying is that he\u2019s made a career out of talking about food without ever understanding its true relationship personally.\u201cCooked\u201d is a nationwide gustatory road-trip mapped out to right that wrong. While it lacks the ferocity of an Anthony Bourdain treatise, it has a similar effect in that it asks us to question the obvious while leaving us hungering for the forbidden fruit of our guilty pleasures.The book is organized around the four classical elements, fire, water, air, and earth. In its simplest form, \u201cCooked\u201d uses each element as a classroom opportunity for Pollan to learn one classic\u2014otherwise mundane\u2014recipe at a time. To examine fire, he seeks out a southern barbecue master. Diving into water, he teams up with a former Chez Panisse chef. For air, he ventures into the ancient art of bread baking. And finally for earth, he seizes upon that mysterious organic process we call fermentation. These all reinforce the subtitle of the book, \u201cA Natural History of Transformation.\u201d \u201cCooked\u201d seems more the work of a cultural anthropologist than that of the food systems activist we\u2019ve known.FIRE:Greeks and Egyptians, Persians, and even medieval alchemists all had some interpretation of the four elements. Michael Pollan leads with fire and approaches it quite literally. We go with him as he gets in his car and drives to a little town in North Carolina known for its barbecue cookery. This unproven Yankee dons his neophyte hat and wades into a backwoods barbecue pit overseen by a 30-something man with barbecue in his blood named Samuel Jones.The section shows in detail the lessons Pollan will need to learn to understand this succulent American right of passage known as barbecue. It starts with a treatise on how our very species invented fire, and then cooking with it as a way to do nothing less than preserve and advance our DNA. Before the section ends, we find some iconic Pollan, regaling us with Freudian references: \u201cCooking with fire remains very much a competitive male preserve, and those of us who do it should probably count ourselves lucky Freud isn\u2019t around to offer his analysis of exactly what it is we\u2019re up to.\u201dPollan doesn\u2019t leave classical Greek interpretations of fire alone either. He devotes pages to tales of Zeus and Prometheus and plots of revenge and retribution for betrayals of gods and mortals. \u201cThe Prometheus story becomes a myth of the origin of cooking, an account of how animal sacrifice evolved into a form of feasting, thanks to Prometheus\u2019 daring reapportionment of the sacrificial animal to favor man.\u201dThe emphatic call to arms of fire is that it was born to cook meat.WATER:This second section starts with a chef\u2019s most basic of tasks, chopping \u201cveg\u201d for a mirepoix. Pollan\u2019s stop at this juncture is illustrative of the book\u2019s mission. He realizes he\u2019s been part of the problem, which thus far he\u2019s been unwilling to admit in his other books. Recognizing that playing an active role in the preparation and \u201ctransformation\u201d of food is the mea culpa that drives the narrative.\u201cToday the typical American spends a mere twenty-seven minutes a day on food preparation, and another four minutes cleaning up. That\u2019s less than half the time spent cooking and cleaning up in 1965, when I was a boy. Somewhat more than half of the evening meals an American eats today are still \u201ccooked at home,\u201d according to the market researchers.\u201d Still, he\u2019s far from taking it all on the chin himself:\u201cThe very same activity that many people regard as a form of drudgery has somehow been elevated to a popular spectator sport. When you consider that twenty-seven minutes is less time than it takes to watch a single episode of Top Chef or The New Food Network Star, you realize that there are now millions of people who spend more time watching food being cooked on television than they spend actually cooking it themselves.\u201dPollan\u2019s work on water examines its important role in the transformation process. Extracting flavors and separating, then reconstituting, chemical compounds in food is critical to our expectations of taste. For this lesson he employs an upwardly reaching chef, Samin Nosrat, formerly of Chez Panisse fame. Pollan spent Sundays with Samin to learn the intricacies of the pot. The subtle combinations of flavors\u2014this vegetable with that\u2014or the order in which we add them to a soup or a braise provide telltale signals to our brain about a food\u2019s cultural origins.The power of the chop (we\u2019re talking veggies here) combines with water (or oil or other liquids) to create a myriad of flavors, all of which require tending. Pollan refers to this \u201cdrudgery\u201d as the \u201cantithesis\u201d of what fire requires. \u201cIndeed,\u201d he continues, \u201cThe only time the grill man or pit master deploys a knife is at the very end of his show.\u201dWater it seems was designed for the pot, and in the pot we find veg.AIR:This chapter focuses on part of a cooking tradition that is akin to religion. In fact some of the greatest books on bread-baking are still published by Jesuit brothers and priests. Pollan joins the ranks of millions of us in search of salvation from that perfect loaf because, he intimates, we\u2019re either meant to be bakers, or we\u2019re not.\u201cI had baked one or two loaves years before with only middling results, and had concluded baking was probably not for me.\u201d This conclusion is one I\u2019ve heard espoused by many of my own friends. Even my wife, an otherwise accomplished cook, claims she\u2019s had far too many catastrophes to make any further attempts at baking. So here\u2019s something of his work that certainly speaks to all of us. One way to think about bread, he suggests, \u201cis simply this: as an ingenious technology for improving the flavor, digestibility, and nutritional value of grass.\u201d Pollan peeks behind the curtain of naturally fermented breads, too. He talks about the mysteries and vagaries of rising dough, of the care and feeding of a sourdough starter, and the downright bizarre rituals discussed by authors and bloggers about how wild yeasts and strains of bacteria find their way into mason jars hidden in the dark recesses of San Francisco apartments. Then Pollan incriminates himself as just another foodie-mortal powerless to the seductions of bread with this mouth-watering description of the finished product.\u201cThe best bread I ever tasted was a big country loaf shot through with holes the size of marbles and golf balls\u2014easily more air than bread. It had a tough hide of a crust very nearly burned, but held inside a crumb so tender, moist, and glossy it made you think of custard. There was something sensual about the strong contrast between these two realms\u2014outside and inside, hard and soft. The bread was so powerfully aromatic that, had I been alone, I would have been tempted to push my face into it.\u201dAir explains to us the importance of the places in between, and the role we have as humans to manipulate that space to our own ends.EARTH:Michael Pollan doesn\u2019t let this sensual loaf seduce him to distraction. He also looks towards other aspects of fermentation in the food system, reminding us that before refrigeration, canning, and chemicals, fermentation was the primary form of preserving food over long periods of time. He talks of Korean kimchi buried in the backyard, Russian kefir, yogurt, and of breadfruit aging in Fiji pits to eventual odiferous perfection as something resembling the scent of road kill after a week in the sun.Finally he covers something dear to many of my friends: the role of fermentation in making alcohol, and specifically beer. This, as it turns out, is another specialty of the religious. If you\u2019ve ever had Belgian ale, you can thank a monk.Speaking of fermenting cultures he says, \u201cIt not only seems alive, it is alive. And most of this living takes place at a scale inaccessible to us without a microscope.\u201d Earth is really about stuff that lives and breathes and changes food from one form into another. As humans we are sometimes the instigators, but mainly bystanders in a process that closely mimics the very way life is thought to have emerged from that primordial ooze.\u201cCooked: A Natural History of Transformation\u201d is an eye-opening read, but it pries your lids up in a very different way than his previous books. Gone are the diatribes and stabs at American corporate agriculture that many of us grew to appreciate from him. That edge is replaced with a new foundation of self-discovery, one akin to the sense of wonder served up by children. It begs you to turn the page, grab some ingredients, and push upon the edges of your own food comfort zone.Michael Pollan is the author of seven books including: The Botany of Desire, In Defense of Food, An Omnivore\u2019s Dilemma, A Place of My Own, Second Nature, Food Rules, and Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation. All these books are available at our local books stores throughout northwest Lower Michigan."}, {"userName": "Kam", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5399361-kam", "userReview": "Late last year I, along with my mother and father, took a blood test to check for any health issues that might have cropped up over the previous year, as well as to check up on pre-existing conditions. The latter was mostly for my parents, but it was also important that I get my blood tested to make sure I hadn't developed any conditions of my own. My tests from the year before last, when my mother started encouraging us to do this, had come back clean, and I was fully expecting these tests to come in clean, too.That was not the case. My sodium levels might have been within normal tolerances, and my sugar was a little high for comfort, but my cholesterol gave me great cause for alarm - my doctor told me that I had the cholesterol level of someone twice my age. I was given two choices: either start medication, or adjust my diet. I took the diet option without even thinking twice.Now, the word \"diet\" tends to imply that one is about to starve oneself in order to lose weight, but to my mind, that's not what \"diet\" means - and I think my doctor is rather proud that I do not define \"diet\" in that manner, either. \"Diet\" has, to me, never meant that I ought to go hungry, but simply that I alter what I consume to silence that hunger. So: less junk food, less soda (very much less soda, now), and far, far less fast food. All of these were easy decisions to make, especially when I started packing lunches instead of buying them - which, of course, meant home cooking.And it is home cooking - or cooking from scratch - that is the central focus of Michael Pollan's latest book, Cooked. Divided into four sections named after the four classical elements - Fire, Water, Air, and Earth - Pollan talks about his journey of learning how to cook, apprenticing himself to a Southern barbeque pit master; a Chez Panisse-trained former-student-turned-personal-cooking-instructor; a baker; and a cheese-maker, and learning from each of them various methods and traditions of cooking, while at the same time contemplating on where these methods fit in our lives, how they affect us, and what losing or continuing them might mean for humanity as a whole. The result is a fascinating sequence of anecdotes, interspersed with a great deal of science, history, and philosophy, all told in Pollan's eminently readable narrative style. Those who have read The Omnivore's Dilemma will, in all likelihood, be comparing it to Cooked, and will find a great many similarities between them - perhaps too many for some. The Introduction, in particular, will read very,very similar to the content of The Omnivore's Dilemma, and some readers have taken a set against Cooked for this similarity. I, for my part, do not take this against Pollan at all, since I've come to view Cooked as a natural extension of The Omnivore's Dilemma: an expansion, so to speak, of the ideas and philosophies Pollan expounded upon. In Omnivore's Dilemma he concludes that cooking one's own food, as well as taking great care to source ingredients from responsible growers and animal raisers, is one of the keys to a better life, and is in many ways the key to a healthier one. Cooked demonstrates, far beyond the four meals Pollan describes in The Omnivore's Dilemma, how to go about doing just that, as well as showing what humanity lost when it handed control of food production to corporations.As expected, it is in his anecdotes that Pollan truly shines. In the course of his various apprenticeships he explains a whole host of other aspects related to the type of cooking he is doing. For example in the section titled \"Fire\" he discusses the concept of barbecue from the perspective of Southern whole-hog barbecue, interweaving various bits of research and musings on the cooking style's politics (class, race and gender being some of the more interesting angles from which one may approach the concept of barbecue as a whole, and not just whole-hog) and history, all the while telling the story of his brief apprenticeship to pit master Ed Mitchell, and then his own subsequent attempt at doing whole-hog barbecue. He repeats this in his discussion of braising, baking, cheese-making, and beer-brewing, always ensuring to tackle the social, political, historical, and gender-related aspects of each method of cooking. What I found especially fun to read, mostly because it's related to my own interests, was the section on baking. I can do stovetop cooking, but I have something of a fear of spattering oil, so I don't do much of it if I can. Baking however - that is an entirely different story. There is something comforting and magical about combining a set of raw ingredients, putting it in an oven, and more or less leaving it there until the nose (and occasionally the eye, but more the nose) judges it the right time to pull out whatever has been cooking - and while waiting, nothing is more pleasurable than to catch up on my reading. Every year around December I bake chocolate-chip cookies as Christmas gifts for family members, and it is easy to read a chapter or two before smelling that delicious, mouthwatering scent of chocolate, butter, and vanilla and pausing a while to pull out the cooked batch to put in a new one, before settling down to read another chapter.Pollan, however, goes much further than simply making cookies - he bakes what I (and many other bakers) consider to be the ultimate baking accomplishment: bread. Though I come from a country and culture whose staple grain is rice, bread is still an important food item in the Philippines, and we do still eat quite a bit of it (mostly for breakfast and merienda - the Filipino equivalent of afternoon tea), so the idea of baking my own bread is incredibly appealing. Therefore, reading about Pollan's attempt to culture his own sourdough starter, and his discourse on bread of the past, present, and perhaps of the future, made for thoroughly enjoyable reading. And here is what I think is the most enjoyable aspect of this book, aside from Pollan's anecdotes and narrative style: the fact that all of this encourages the reader to try their hand at cooking for himself or herself. Pollan even includes the recipes in the book's appendix, though by the time the reader gets to them she or he is aware that a recipe is not a hard-and-fast rule when it comes to cooking - something Pollan learns throughout the course of the book. As I mentioned earlier, The Omnivore's Dilemma makes the case for home-cooking, but Cooked shows the reader how one may make that case - and cause - one's own. Pollan makes it clear that it is not going to be easy, that there will be many mistakes along the way, but they do give the reader hope that perhaps it is not as daunting as one assumes it to be (something Pollan specifically tackles in \"Water,\" the section dealing with the slow-braising of food). To be sure, Pollan has the advantage of access to some of the best people in their field, but he makes it clear that just because he has access to the experts does make him as good as they at their own specialty. That takes time and practice - and it is something Pollan himself recognizes, and encourages the reader to have in any future cooking endeavors.Overall, Cooked is, at its core, no different thematically from The Omnivore's Dilemma, but it should not be viewed as a rehash of that book - rather, one should approach it as an extension of what Pollan was trying to do in The Omnivore's Dilemma: that it is better to cook one's own food. The Omnivore's Dilemma explains the greater cultural and health-related reasons for home-cooking; Cooked emphasizes that but also adds a far more personal dimension. It will not be easy at first - Pollan's stories about his apprenticeships make this clear - but if one keeps at it, one is sure to reap the benefits of that time and patience, not only in better health or a clearer statement about (or against) the world, but also something that will bring great personal satisfaction - something to do, first and foremost, for oneself."}, {"userName": "Cat", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/78792-cat", "userReview": "I enjoyed this book *so much*. Yes, it's grandiose (divided into the four primal elements--fire, water, air, earth) and sometimes simplistic (if you cook your own food, you are opting out of our corporate-consumerist culture? really? more on this later), but it's so much fun! First of all, it's fun to read about the experience of cooking, and Pollan is winningly self-deprecating and evocatively descriptive. Second of all, the fire, water, air, earth division really works in drawing attention to the psychological and cultural resonances of different types of cooking...this is especially powerful when Pollan talks about the perversity and morbidity of fermentation. Thirdly, Pollan is an incredibly articulate nerd, weaving together theories and facts from anthropology, anatomy, biology, psychology, literature, etc., into a compelling tapestry about how we make food and why these processes matter to us (symbolically as well as biologically). The section about fermentation, pickling, and microbiota is totally fascinating. I kept quoting factoids from this book to anyone who would listen, and I am eager to try out making my own sourdough starter from wild yeasts (perhaps a dangerous project in a household with a toddler and four cats in it, but ah, well...). If you'll forgive the inevitable gustatory metaphor, I gobbled this book up. So. Tasty.That being said, Pollan's claim (articulated at various points fairly directly in the text) that any of these leisure-time activities (undertaken here by a wealthy and successful freelance nonfiction writer living in the Bay Area) could be potent forms of rebellion against the industrial complex that creates so much of our food and uses marketing to instill a feeling of helplessness in the consumer...that seems problematic to me at best and willfully delusional at the worst. Yes, I personally consider it important in my household that I cook every day. Yes, we also use plenty of prepared food products, and I have absolutely no illusions that we are living off the grid. Because it's a familial and cultural tradition, because it's fun and tasty, because it will instill in my daughter (we hope!) a love of fruits and vegetables and grains that you can't get from processed cheddar bunnies (also a big hit with her), we embrace these food preparation rituals in our home. And I sometimes become obsessed with the idea of making something from scratch and making it correctly (like the semester when I baked bread almost every day). In other words, \"Michael Pollan--c'est moi!\"But to imagine that to prepare food from \"scratch\" in your own home (with the help of professional chefs in Pollan's case!) is to opt out of a consumer system...is to mystify the consumer system you are participating in. Pollan is just pursuing his own consumer form of distinction. The recipe for authenticity here is investing time and money in training and ingredients, and time and money are in short supply for many segments of the population. Pollan never really addresses the political and economic trouble that other people don't have this much time...he just points out that people should think about cooking instead of watching TV, thus implicitly stigmatizing other social classes and groups for their priorities (and for their exhaustion as well!). Pollan is buying ingredients and preparing them with the rarefied knowledge to which his education, social class, professional status, etc., grant him access. This is not escaping a consumer system; it's claiming that you can tailor that system to fit your idealized view of yourself. It's individualism as rebellion, when in fact the corporate-consumer system relies on our sense of ourselves as individuals above all (who can demonstrate that individualism through which commodities we use.)This problem at the heart of Pollan's book made me think of a fellow scholar's current project, tracing the model of neoliberal citizenship through postwar nonfiction genres including the memoir and the New Journalism (I'm looking at you, Daniel Worden!). The Michael Pollan food book would bear out the hypothesis that certain nonfiction genres that fetishize individualism in a seemingly iconoclastic way actually pave the way for the acceptance of contemporary life as an increasingly market-driven arena for self-definition. Pollan's emphasis that the market's products should be better and more ethical (see his apt critique of commodity pork) is not a particularly radical departure from this agenda. Even as this book embraces a kind of bougie food authenticity that may indeed be just another consumer status symbol, Pollan celebrates the messy immersion in artistic/artisan production and the intimate connections with other people that can come through cooking. So even as neoliberal citizenship prizes the illusion of individualism in the global marketplace, there also is room within this consumerist culture to make meaning. And I don't doubt Pollan's sincerity on that at all.Pollan also makes the good point that enacting these processes of making our own food *does* undo (albeit temporarily) the alienation from the products of our labor endemic to capitalism (as Marx observed so many years ago). It demystifies processes that have become specialized, even arcane. I realized how much I accept the final product without understanding what gets us there (dude, I had *no idea* how cheese was made, and I'm not feeling so good about the definition of \"rennet\"). Pollan does a wonderful job telling the story of those transformations, and it is for this story-telling that I most prize his work."}, {"userName": "Darren", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9039058-darren", "userReview": "Talk about hitting the nail squarely on the head, the publicity material for this thought-provoking book gets it right and sets the tone - more and more are we reading about/watching about food and cookery, it is easier and easier to get ingredients from anywhere in the world yet as a society we eat more and more processed foods and actually cook less. Reheating is not cooking.The author considers the paradox that society seems to be preferring to think about and consume the art of cooking instead of undertaking the exact-same exercise. At the same time \"we\" tend to increasingly worry about the origin of ingredients, welfare of animals in our food chain and obsess about our health and diet, whilst shovelling down more and more processed foods. The author's solution is easier said than done: get cooking. This hardback book with an impenetrable academic-sounding title lets you sit on the author's shoulder, looking on as he rediscovers the art and love of cooking by getting out and about, cooking with and using the basic elements of fire, water, air and the earth. Recipes not included.This is not a book that glorifies the celebrity chef world, it doesn't sit and lecture on the evils of factory-produced meals whilst talking up the world of small-scale artisan production. Instead it is a more back to basic, good and honest appreciation, drawing inspiration from many sources and possibly acting as a voyage of rediscovery along the way. It is not going to be a light read, despite it being written in a biography or diary style. It is text, text and more text. No action images of the author doing his stuff, no mouth-watering images, no scenic shots. For a first person book it is surprisingly ego-free too.If you are prepared to put the time in with this book you will probably come away a more inspired, interested and possibly active cook. The book effectively demands participation without being so uncouth as to actually demand it. Inspires would be an insipid word. It just \"does\" but short of seeing the book for yourself, sharing in the belief and participating in the process you might not fully appreciate the possible enormity of the changes that may follow. Of course, you might still prefer to sit on the couch, watch a \"cooking show\", consume the culinary dream and convince yourself that you are part of the cooking craze or culture, before eating your supermarket-produced ready meal.This book might be one of those lightbulb moments for you that can generate some life-changing moments. Or it might be something you consider is a waste of your money and abandon it in haste.

It\u2019s one of the few forms of rebelliousness to which I wholeheartedly subscribe. Having read Salt Sugar Fat by Michael Moss last year, I been working diligently at eliminating processed foods from my diet\u2014easier said than done! Especially when one is also attempting to go gluten-free. I have many happy memories of cooking on the farm where I grew up. We knew the cows that provided our milk, the chickens that laid our eggs and the cattle and pigs that provided each evening\u2019s main course. Sometimes Mom would even mention them by name as she served up supper. I have been in quest of a real pork chop for some time now and think I have found a butcher shop that provides a product very, very close to my idealized memories. One of the things which struck me when I moved to the city was the lack of taste in the meat and vegetables purchased from the chain grocery stores. Carrots from a chain store are more like wood than like vegetables and tomatoes are hard and tasteless compared to those we grew in our garden (fertilized with well-aged, long composted animal manure). The problem, for me at least, is one of time. I love to cook and bake\u2014but I also work full time and enjoy a busy social life. Having read Cooked, I can see that I will start attempting to schedule more cooking time into my life\u2014in the past, I have whiled away many happy hours stirring soup pots, checking on oven contents and poking at dough.

This book, as several others by this author, does just that.In \"Cooked\" Pollen posits the theory that cooking not only allowed ancient humans to enlarge their diet as they changed from a hunter/gatherer society but to change the very humans themselves. By cooking, one way or the other, those ancestors managed to do part of the work of digestion outside their body so they, like our relatives the apes/monkeys don't have to spend hours every day chewing to get the nutrients they needed from their food.The way he attacks the issue is to divide cooking into fire, water, air and earth. To illustrate each one, he finds an expert to teach him about the way those elements work. He learns to barbecue, braise, bake and brew and relates the usually self-mocking ways he does it wrong before he learns to do it right.Along the way, he gives the reader a grounding in how each method of cooking has changed and what we have both lost and gained by the change.

Michael Pollan is one of my favorite food writers and I always enjoy his books, this one as well. However, this was a little too in depth for me.Michael explores the four realms of cooking in this book, Fire, Water, Air and Earth. For Fire, he uses whole hog barbeque. For Water, he explores braising. For air, his example is baking bread. For Earth he uses fermentation. Basically, he breaks all of these cooking methods down to the smallest elements and builds on it.My final thought on this book is that it was interesting, but if your not really into cooking/food then this book may be too much for you."}, {"userName": "Brandice", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36348070-brandice", "userReview": "\"Cooking puts several kinds of distance between the brutal facts of the matter (dead animals for dinner) and the dining room table set with crisp linens and polished silver.\"Cooked was a book that for the most part, I found interesting. Pollan studies 4 classic elements: Fire, Water, Air, and Earth, and their impact on the creation of food and beverage. For me, the book read in descending order of interest - the fire and water chapters were better and kept my interest much more than air and earth. I took many more breaks in the second half. I am admittedly not an expert in the kitchen. I'm a novice at best and it's not a high priority of mine to achieve expert level. That said, this may have something to do with my up/down interest in the book - I think opinions will vary re: which sections are most engaging, just based on personal preferences. I also loveddd The Omnivore's Dilemma, and Cooked just wasn't on the same level. \"Each of the different methods I learned for turning the stuff of nature into tasty creations of culture implies a different way of engaging with the world, and some are more sympathetic than others.\" If you are already a Pollan fan and/or beyond novice level in the kitchen, I'm more likely to recommend \"you\" check Cooked out.

Here, he discovers the enduring power of the four classical elements\u2014fire, water, air, and earth\u2014to transform the stuff of nature into delicious things to eat and drink. Apprenticing himself to a succession of culinary masters, Pollan learns how to grill with fire, cook with liquid, bake bread, and ferment everything from cheese to beer. Each section of Cooked tracks Pollan\u2019s effort to master a single classic recipe using one of the four elements. A North Carolina barbecue pit master tutors him in the primal magic of fire; a Chez Panisse\u2013trained cook schools him in the art of braising; a celebrated baker teaches him how air transforms grain and water into a fragrant loaf of bread; and finally, several mad-genius \u201cfermentos\u201d (a tribe that includes brewers, cheese makers, and all kinds of picklers) reveal how fungi and bacteria can perform the most amazing alchemies of all. The reader learns alongside Pollan, but the lessons move beyond the practical to become an investigation of how cooking involves us in a web of social and ecological relationships. Cooking, above all, connects us. The effects of not cooking are similarly far reaching.
