What start out as unrelated short stories, gradually overlap and converge into one whole. Like a Rubik's cube, the colours unscramble, but the puzzle isn't solved completely. This book messes with your expectations constantly. Fresh and inventive, this is a terrific debut."}, {"userName": "Jaclyn Crupi", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13323030-jaclyn-crupi", "userReview": "Thrilled to read some experimental Australian fiction about life, loneliness and death in the internet age. This book had to contend with some major personal life events and the fact that it held my attention is a testament to how good it is.

RUBIK is a series of short stories that appear to be separate, but as you go on, the narrative interweaves into one cohesive book...much like a Rubik's Cube. It\u2019s so strange and unusual, but in the most awesome way. It covers everything from technology to capitalism, to loneliness and grief. It appeals to my undying love of pop culture, fandom, and science fiction. Also, the author gives a nod to one of my favorite movies of all time, Inception. You follow a collection of eccentric characters, starting with a young girl, Elena Rubik, who gets killed in an accident and leaves behind a mysterious electronic footprint.I cannot recommend this high-concept, fantastically written, imaginative book enough! If you want to read something that is truly unique, then RUBIK is a must! I cannot wait to see what Tan comes up with next!"}, {"userName": "Rachel Le\u00f3n", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21291796-rachel-le-n", "userReview": "I love interlinked short story collections and this one is quite brilliant."}, {"userName": "Michael Livingston", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1340545-michael-livingston", "userReview": "A wonderfully smart and engaging book, with the links between the component stories only gradually becoming clear as you go.

So, I finished this book sometime after returning to NZ in November, after putting a copy on reserve & waiting for it to come to me. This book is kind of an experimental novel, kind of a set of linked short stories. There were certain sections I loved and wished Elizabeth Tan had returned to, like Pikkoro and the Multipurpose Octopus and Rubik, the title 'story'. I appreciated the inventiveness, but not how scattered it felt to read, and some of its content (like Congratulations You May Have Already Won, with its use of a lonely man writing to a spam email account) has been done before and does not appeal to me. For a debut, though, I was very pleased to have read this and am keen to check out what Elizabeth puts out next.Also, no fault of the author, but the synopsis on the back of the book is incredibly misleading! There is truly no point in reading it -- if you like the sound of the synopsis, you won't find it in the book. And if it turns you off, it has no bearing on the actual book & so has also misled you. Readers, beware!"}, {"userName": "Bram", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8565748-bram", "userReview": "As a child of the 80s, I was well and truly a member of the Rubik's Cube generation. I totally sucked at it. While all my friends twisted and turned the little squares until they lined up into six beautifully solid sides, I was forced to resort to the safe space of the spatially challenged: cheating. Sometimes I'd peel off all the stickers and re-stick them to form a slightly off-kilter face with peeling edges. Other times, I'd pull the entire cube apart into its constituent squares and carefully reassemble it. All of which is a round about way of saying, I read Elizabeth Tan's Rubik with a sense of exhilaration I can only imagine was felt by those friends more savvy with the whole twist and win strategy as they neared completion. Rubik is wonderfully original; a series of stories that seem, at first, to be only tangentially related but which spiral into an intricately woven narrative that is quite clearly a novel. It's playful, weird, thrilling and, at times, rather moving. Put simply, you should read it."}, {"userName": "Sharon", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9411460-sharon", "userReview": "Rubik is so many things at once - a collection of somewhat related, intensifying snippets, a tragedy, a thriller, an anime episode, a commentary on technology and corporations - it's hard to pin down, but is essential reading. Stories take on the facets of the eponymous cube, leaving you with half-answers and wild imaginings. Don't expect a neat storyline or ending - this is the novel's answer to The Matrix and Inception. You have everything necesary to begin, if you dare."}, {"userName": "Alex Owens", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54210978-alex-owens", "userReview": "Utterly weird, but strangely addictive - the plots make no sense, then they do, then they don't again... some of the coolest experimental contemporary fiction I've read in a while!"}, {"userName": "Natasha Tresham", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18699576-natasha-tresham", "userReview": "Started off really well. I thought all the threads would come together in the end but it careered out of control, kind of like listening to somebody recounting a vivid dream, which is only really interesting for the dreamer not the listener.

The stories where not immediately apparent how they were interwoven. Reading this was like peeling an onion with finding not just more onion but something very special. This taped into my love of pop culture especially the movies The Matrix and Inception but many other things as well. There were points I was taken back to the point were I read Vonnegut voraciously, there is that way of looking at the world sideways which both Elizabeth Tan and Kurt Vonnegut both have and are able to share through interesting stories. I also loved that I could feel the stories being about locations in Perth Western Australia which was nice, I can only read so many books about New York after all.I would definitely recommend this book to others."}, {"userName": "James Whitmore", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13849691-james-whitmore", "userReview": "This is a gorgeous book. A careful reader might be able to disentangle the devilishly interwoven threads but it doesn't matter if you can't. I enjoyed the overriding feeling of techno-conspiracy and paranoia. It is full of online forums, Inception fan fic, anime, and numbers that may or may not be important. But I enjoyed most the observations of boring reality, so accurate they hurt.

She persists: as a set of corneas, as a newsletter subscriber, as a member of fanfiction forums. Her best friend Jules Valentine meanwhile is unwittingly inveigled into an indie-film turned corporate branding stunt. When Jules leaks information about the true story behind the video \u2013 by then an overworked viral meme \u2013 wannabe investigative reporter April Kuan is assigned the case. But as April trails Jules all over Perth she too becomes ensnared in the machinations of shady corporate interests as the very laws of physics and time begin to bend.A hit in Tan\u2019s native Australia, and now developing a following Stateside too, Rubik is a brilliantly entwined novel-in-stories that slips outside the borders of realism. Spotted with disappearances, mysteries and told with a sharp-edged wit and cutting social commentary, it is an original and ingenious reflection of technological anxiety, loneliness and connectivity in the internet age.", "title": "Rubik", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36988708-rubik", "average": 3.99, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1528101897l/36988708.jpg", "reviews": 21, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6424731.Elizabeth_Tan", "name": "Elizabeth Tan"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Short Stories", "Literary Fiction", "Contemporary", "Cultural"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36988708-rubik", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33846181-rubik", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36988706-rubik", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34821627-rubik", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30809386-the-best-australian-stories-2016", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14417744-epilogue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35138885-tincture-journal-issue-eighteen-winter-2017", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35863677-review-of-australian-fiction"]}
