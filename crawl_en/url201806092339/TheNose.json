The story then ships to the awakening Major Kolyakov, who soon realizes his nose has absconded, leading behind nothing but a space in the middle of his face \u201cas flat as a pancake.\u201d Soon\u2014muffled, concealing his shame--he goes out onto the St. Petersburg street, and spies what he is sure is his nose (also muffled) leaving a carriage and entering into the house of an important official. But, worse than all this, is the fact that that his former nose is now wearing a uniform, and the nose\u2019s rank is higher than that of the \u201cMajor\u201d himself.Why a nose? Well, Gogol had an odd shaped nose, which we know because he himself ridiculed its appearance in his letters, and I take that as pretty good evidence other people made fun of it too. But of course, although the nose may be self-referential, it is also phallic: what better symbol for a man deprived of the accoutrements of power than a missing, errant nose?This is miraculous piece of fiction, and\u2014like all miracles\u2014it doesn\u2019t open itself readily to convincing explanations. Its owes much of its ineffable power, I believe, to its early, daring and dreamlike shift from a nose-sized nose to a human-sized nose stepping down from a carriage, a shift Gogol accomplishes without any attempt to explain or excuse the transformation. If the reader will accept this absurdity, he will accept anything. And\u2014speaking for one reader at least\u2014I accepted it without thinking, and--from this point on--Gogol had on completely his spell."}, {"userName": "Huda Yahya", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7878381-huda-yahya", "userReview": "\u0645\u0627\u0630\u0627 \u0644\u0648 \u0623\u0646 \u0623\u0646\u0641\u0643 \u0642\u0631\u0631 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062a\u0631\u0643 \u0648\u062c\u0647\u0643 \u0648\u064a\u0635\u064a\u0631 \u0644\u0647 \u0625\u0631\u0627\u062f\u0629 \u062d\u0631\u0629..\u061f\u0645\u0633\u0624\u0648\u0644 \u062d\u0643\u0648\u0645\u064a \u0645\u062b\u0644\u0627..\u061f\u0648\u0645\u0627\u0630\u0627 \u0644\u0648 \u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0635\u0627\u0631 \u0623\u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0646\u0643 \u0631\u062a\u0628\u0629 \u0648\u0645\u0643\u0627\u0646\u0629..\u061f\u0645\u0627\u0630\u0627 \u0633\u062a\u0641\u0639\u0644..\u061f:::::::::::::::::\u0643\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u064a\u0642\u0638 \u062c\u0631\u064a\u062c\u0648\u0631 \u0633\u0627\u0645\u0633\u0627 \u0644\u064a\u062c\u062f \u0646\u0641\u0633\u0647 \u0642\u062f \u062a\u062d\u0648\u0644 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u062d\u0634\u0631\u0629\u064a\u0633\u062a\u064a\u0642\u0638 \u0643\u0648\u0641\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0641 \u0641\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u062c\u062f \u0623\u0646\u0641\u0647 \u0641\u064a \u0645\u0643\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u062a\u0627\u062f \u0641\u0648\u0642 \u0634\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0628\u0647\u0643\u064a\u0641 \u064a\u0639\u064a\u0634 \u062f\u0648\u0646 \u0623\u0646\u0641\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0628\u0647 \u064a\u0631\u0641\u0639\u0647 \u0628\u062a\u0639\u0627\u0644 \u0623\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u062e\u0631\u064a\u0646..\u061f\u0643\u064a\u0641 \u0644\u0647 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u063a\u0627\u0632\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u0646\u0627\u0648\u0627\u062a \u062f\u0648\u0646\u0647..\u061f\u0625\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u0634\u0643\u0644\u0629.. \u0623\u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0643\u0630\u0644\u0643..\u061f:D:::::::::::::::::\u0648\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0635\u0629 \u0645\u0644\u064a\u0626\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u0645\u064a\u0632 \u0648\u0646\u0642\u062f \u0633\u062e\u0627\u0641\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u062a\u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u062f\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0637\u062d\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0641\u0627\u0642\u0648\u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0646\u0648\u0627\u062a \u0643\u062a\u0628\u062a \u0639\u0634\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0641\u0633\u064a\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0644\u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0635\u0629 \u0648\u0645\u063a\u0632\u0627\u0647\u0627\u0643\u0644\u0647\u0627 \u062a\u062d\u0627\u0648\u0644 \u0641\u0647\u0645 \u062f\u0644\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0646\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u064a\u062a\u0631\u0643 \u0635\u0627\u062d\u0628\u0647 \u0648\u064a\u063a\u0627\u062f\u0631:::::::::::::::::\u0644\u0627 \u062a\u062a\u0648\u0642\u0639 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u062c\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0628\u062b \u0647\u0646\u0627 \u0643\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0628\u062b \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0642\u0631\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0645\u0646 \u0642\u0628\u0644\u063a\u0648\u063a\u0648\u0644 \u064a\u0633\u062a\u062e\u062f\u0645 \u0647\u0646\u0627 \u0623\u0633\u0644\u0648\u0628\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u062e\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u062d\u0631 \u0644\u064a\u0646\u0642\u0644 \u0644\u0643 \u0642\u0635\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062d\u0648\u0644 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0628\u0637\u0631\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u0633\u0628\u0648\u0642\u0629\u0641\u064a\u0642\u0631\u0631 \u0628\u0637\u0644\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0628\u062f\u0623 \u0631\u062d\u0644\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0636\u062d\u0643\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u0628\u062d\u062b \u0639\u0646 \u0623\u0646\u0641\u0647\u0641\u0645\u0627\u0630\u0627 \u0633\u064a\u0641\u0639\u0644 \u064a\u0627 \u062a\u0631\u0649 \u062d\u064a\u0646 \u064a\u062c\u062f\u0647..\u061f\u0648\u0643\u064a\u0641 \u0633\u062a\u0646\u062a\u0647\u064a \u0642\u0635\u062a\u0646\u0627\u0633\u0623\u062a\u0631\u0643 \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0644\u0643\u0645 =)"}, {"userName": "Florencia", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21575078-florencia", "userReview": "It is a truth universally acknowledged that the longer and more carefully we look at a funny story, the sadder it becomes.\nAs expected, this is a hilarious story. After an intriguing introduction that I shall refrain from explaining, we are told that a man woke up, looked at his mirror but didn't find any labyrinths of time nor tigers that haunt dreams. He only noticed that his nose had disappeared. Was it during the night? Perhaps a second before he opened his eyes. We will never know. But, in an act that can only be described as a heinous betrayal and a challenge to every manifestation of reason, that part of his body escaped from the surface of his respectable-looking face and became a well-dressed entity, very pleased with himself and, oddly, with a better social rank than his. Ah, and he was so proud of that rank! You know, he is the kind of person to whom you might ask about the weather and after a minute, you would find yourself listening to a fine gentleman boasting about his important occupations and the comforting feeling that his significant social status gave to him. Nothing profound, certainly. That sort of weakness might be suitable for someone of lesser rank, not him. Following this line of thought, remember, you would have the good fortune of listening to his distinguished conversation only if you belong to a similar status as his, otherwise, I'm afraid he will not be able to answer to you. That would be beneath him. Do not get me wrong, I am not trying to hurt your feelings. I am merely imparting what I regard as relevant information, a dash of knowledge, a gram of wisdom, if you will: the rules of civilization, no less!You should know by now that the person I am referring to, the one who inspired these ridiculous lines\u2014such drivel that he would unquestionably enjoy nonetheless because, after all, we are all talking about him\u2014is no other than our friend Collegiate Assessor Kovalyov (now, if you would be so kind as to call him 'Major', that would help him make it through the night; to gently caress the ego of these upstanding members of society always ensures them a good night's sleep). Oh, the man sans nose. He could still breathe so that was not an issue, obviously. Notwithstanding, there was a visible absence on his face that surely made him feel self-conscious about his appearance. Who wouldn't understand?You might think that the source of his distress was also the fact that he could no longer smell the fragrance of fresh-ground coffee (although he would prefer tea, I suppose). Or the perfume of a woman with whom he might have dreamt of the other night but would not speak about, not to one soul, wishing that such memory would return to the bleak corner of his disobedient mind, where it should have stayed; those little nooks under the shadows of the world that hold unavowed dreams and nightmares that ruin normal sleep patterns. Or the aroma that comes from the snuff-box belonging to a thoughtful clerk who might not be aware of our friend's refined taste. No, the superficial side of human nature would not allow such luxury. Not being able to show his face in public struck fear into his heart. We are in no position to judge here because every individual would feel the same way. Yes, sir. Who wouldn't understand?Once the glimmer of satire has vanished completely and a state of reflection has emerged from the depths of the unconscious, you will discover that underneath this funny story lies the countenance of misery; timid, distant, determined. The anxiety caused by the look of another person. The condescending sneer from a superior. The mockery directed at an inferior. The need to have a respectable place in society and the urge to cling to it as if your life depended on it. Which, at some degree, unfortunately, it does. A natural consequence of people's priorities. You do understand.Gogol, whose name is another universe so different from Dostoyevsky's and yet with countless similar facets, mastered the art of blending humor with tragedy, sheer absurdity with varying nuances of misfortune. Like a chameleon and its unusual ability, his language gradually varies from paragraph to paragraph\u2014entertaining lines might take the form of serious statements filled with amusing nonsense that, by the end of the story, might resemble a set of words dripping the sort of lyricism that transports you to another place defying the laws of time, space and apprehensive dispositions.From that moment on, the thoughts that were impatiently dwelling in some obscure corner that no one would wish to see, manage to free themselves, to leave their self-absorbed bubble. Engulfed in flames of wintry colors and whispering voices, threatened by their wild nature, what are we supposed to do?Look at the windows as you walk by. Better yet, do not go outside. Go to the bathroom where that wide mirror awaits for you every morning when you are most vulnerable, after walking aimlessly through the bedroom because of three or four hours of lousy sleep. Or reach into your handbag and pull out the small mirror you carefully hide from the world\u2014a futile attempt to deny the existence of some vestige of vanity that might still reside in you.In an act of moral courage, we could take a look at what that spotless piece of glass may reflect. We could stand in front of it, hold it before our eyes, struck by fear or overcome with joy, in deep, almost mystical contemplation, just to see ourselves through the perception of others, as we try to grab the nearest lifesaver for we might be sinking in a sea of inhibition; rough waters that may reveal a possible craving for social validation with fluctuating degrees of intensity, knowing all the time that any degree could dissolve all trace of reassurance, at the same speed an ice cube melts in hot water. To touch and recognize everything that visually defines us and emotionally affects us. More importantly, to find out, to bring to light. To actually discern what we might have lost yesterday, a while ago; during the minutes that have died and now belong to an uncertain space composed of unreliable memories and remnants of immortality. The things we are about to lose today. Things I would not want to lose tomorrow but that, as with anything in life, in fact, I may have never even had.Mar 06, 16* Also on my blog.** Austen and Gogol have partaken in the creation of the first sentence.

Sometimes things happen which you would hardly think possible.\u201d\nIndeed, like losing your nose. And for the man who has lost his nose, his life is literally now over. How could he possibly be seen in public again? How could anyone ever take him seriously? How could he ever get that all too important promotion or ever please his wife? So ridiculously funny this reaction becomes, the nose is everything to him and losing it means he can no longer function. And so Gogle wields the absurd to demonstrate the absurd. The man thinks he has a different character now; he is someone else, something else. And here is the rub. What has actually changed? Nothing. His nose has gone. That\u2019s it. In this Gogle shows how much importance is placed upon appearance in this vain, vain, world. It is so strange that a man should think himself so altered because of the loss of such a thing. And this is where the comic elements come in. The story is rather inexplicable, but so is human nature. The events don\u2019t make a great deal of sense or follow any logic, but, again, neither does human nature. This is a hilarious story; it\u2019s so weird and wonderful.

The novelette is bizarrely humorous and follows the noseless adventures of Kovalyov running after his nose trying to catch it red-handed(?) and making it sit on his face (heh heh).Poor Kovalyov nearly went out of his mind. He did not know what to make of it. How, in fact, could a nose, which only yesterday was in the middle of his face, and which could not possibly walk around or drive in a carriage, suddenly turn up in a uniform!The Nose in my culture is an allegory for a person's (or their family's) status/honour. So the Hindi phrase 'Naak kaat lena' (to cut one's own nose; and hence, bring shame upon themselves) can be considered this story's phoren dark skinned little cousin.I won't go much into thematic/symbolic analysis. In case you're looking for a serious study, Florencia's review will slay you; unlike yours truly's (the Assclown's). There's some variety of castration complex going on in the story with a dollop of class obsession (that started in Russia during the reign of Peter the Great), a generous sprinkling of neurotic fixation with physical appearance (I am waggling my eyebrows at you, Kardashian Klan), blah blah fish paste.

He wanted to have a look at the likes and comments on the Goodreads review he had posted the previous night, but to his great surprise he found that instead of the 'g' icon there was nothing but an absolutely empty spot! Perplexed, Chabolyov clicked on the All apps icon, but the app could not be found. He began trying his other apps to make sure the phone was not malfunctioning, but to all intents and purposes his phone was in perfect order. Collegiate Assessor Chabolyov sprang out of bed and turned his laptop on.Since the old laptop takes a couple of minutes until it functions smoothly, Chabolyov went to the bathroom, washed his face, and refilled his glass of water in the kitchen. As he returned to the screen, he loaded up Chrome, typed in 'g' in the address bar and pressed Enter, but to his extreme astonishment he was directed not to Goodreads but to gstatic.com/generate_204, the internet login page he used at a Malaysian hotel in September. Confused, he typed in goodreads.com, but only reached the generic homepage. No matter - this happens occasionally, especially after the laptop crashes (I really need to buy a new one soon, Chabolyov thought). Having typed in his email and password, he was shaken at the red letters telling him that there was no account linked to this address. He tried again, this time slowly, but the same haunting words appeared.In a terrible panic Chabolyov called his good friend Mikhail, who was more of a casual reader but had a Goodreads account nevertheless.\"...Hello?\"\"Hey Mikhail, it's J. Yeah, I'm sorry to call you this early in the morning, you must've still been sleeping but umm, here's the thing...Goodreads disappeared from my phone, and I can't seem to log in on my laptop either. Would you mind just logging in and checking my profile?\"\"Uh, sure! Give me a minute. Uhh...Alright...Goodreads...how should I find you? Oh right, Friends list...J...hmm, that's strange. I can't find you in my list.\"\"Did you go through the whole list? My avatar is a picture of my cats now.\"\"Yeah, I did. Did you deactivate your account or something? No, you wouldn't do that actually, considering how much you use Goodreads.\"\"Don't think you can on this site anyway. Can you...try checking out your notifications? I liked your status when you started reading The Count of Monte Cristo last week.\"\"Ah alright. Hmm nope, my last notification is from two weeks ago, it says.\"\"Really? Uhm...never mind, maybe it's a site glitch and my account is floating in limbo for some reason. Thanks for the help, I'll talk to you later.\"\"No worries man! Hope it gets fixed soon. See ya.\"Telling himself that this must be a temporary glitch (but then why was Mikhail unaffected?), and realising his hunger, Chabolyov went to the kitchen to make some breakfast. He got the usual bowl, and put in it three Weet-Bix, some Nutri-Grain and Corn Flakes, honey, pieces of red grapefruit, and milk. Back at the screen and without Goodreads, he had to make do with the news feed on Facebook and playing over last night's games from the London Chess Classic while eating.Chabolyov had an ordinary day at work, but Goodreads was on his mind a fair bit. Even if the website was glitching for some reason (he thought of other readers around the world who might be having the same issues), how had the app disappeared from his phone? How was it possible? He had re-installed the app on his phone and had tried logging in several times throughout the day, but to no avail. After getting home in the evening and trying once more on his laptop, he fared no better. Thinking that he shouldn't lose too much time or sleep over this, he answered some emails and got some work done in the evening, since he might as well be productive when he can't procrastinate on Goodreads.He had decided to give the issue a rest until the following morning and read until going to bed, when Mikhail called him around midnight (his friends all know he is a night owl).\"Hey man! I was curious after your call in the morning so I checked before, I'm glad it's been resolved.\"\"Wait, what? Damn, thanks for letting me know, I'd given up for the night! Let me just log in...uh...what? Incorrect password?...hmm, this is weird. So you can see my profile again?\"\"Yeah, I can. You just posted a review an hour ago, right? Uh, I haven't read it yet, but it looks like a long one on The Book of Disquiet.\"\"Huh? I haven't been on the whole day, and besides, I haven't written my review on that book yet. Are you sure that's me?\"\"Yeah, of course. What do you mean, it isn't you on your account?\"\"Nope. Hmm...damn, says the password is incorrect on my phone, too. Hey, mind if I quickly pop over to check this out?\"\"Yeah feel free! I'm actually at the uni computer lab and I was about to go home so I'll leave my computer on for you. Lab 21, Computer 14.\"On Mikhail's computer in the lab, Chabolyov's worst fears were realised: someone had somehow got into his account, had changed the password, and was impersonating him. The review on The Book of Disquiet was...he must admit, pretty good. Descriptive and with a rich vocabulary (clearly superior to his own), convincing in elucidating just what made the book so good. But it was dry and indifferent, absolutely dry and impersonal, as if the review was typed up with a keyboard of sand. Already, comments from friends were coming in, praising the new writing style. It isn't me! Chabolyov thought, and with a red face he checked the profile page to see if there were any changes there. In the about me section, curiously, he realised 'Russian, with a rank of Major.' had been changed to 'Russian, State Councillor'. Although more agitated with every passing minute, Chabolyov was momentarily amused that his impostor was not only a keen writer, but cared very much for his position in society like himself. However, he quickly banished these thoughts. The matter was serious.He saw that the scoundrel had made a comment on the review just two minutes ago, so it was very likely he was still online. Chabolyov sent his own account a message, and the state councillor replied immediately.\"My dear sir, how did you do this?\"\"What do you want?\"\"I don't know how best to put it, sir, but it strikes me as very malicious...Don't you have decency?\"\"Please forgive me, but would you mind telling me what you're talking about?...Explain yourself.\"\"My dear sir,\" continued Chabolyov with shaking fingers, \"I really don't know how you can say that. It's plain enough for anyone to see...you have taken over my Goodreads account!\"\"My dear fellow, you are mistaken. I am a reviewer in my own right. I don't remember how we became friends, but I do not know any Mikhail in Goodreads.\"\"I am using my friend's account at the moment. I am the real Chabolyov. Now, before I contact the Internet Police, I would suggest you tell me how you infiltrated my account, and leave my virtual life in peace.\"However, the thief's responses ceased. At that moment he saw in the other tab that a friend who had been inactive for months had commented on the aforementioned review, and, smiling all over his face, read the lovely comment slowly. But suddenly he jumped up in his chair as though he were sticking his head out of the pool for a breath: he remembered that the review was not his but written by the scoundrel, and tears welled in his eyes. Should he comment in the thread, message all of his friends, that his account has been taken over? Putting his forefinger across his lips in one of his many contemplative poses, Chabolyov weighed up the situation for a few minutes, and decided against it, after seeing in the 'Friends' page that 'Chabolyov' was still offline and might be for who knows how long. He left Goodreads management an email, and over the next hour he copied all of his own reviews and sent them off to himself, in case the state councillor were to delete all of them, as well as his bookshelves (oh, how powerless he was!). Leaving a brief message of thanks to Mikhail upon arriving home, he planned to set up a new account to keep a tab on his own for the night, but an absolute feeling of exhaustion came over him, and not wanting to face up to this difficult situation in reality (I just want to read books and talk about them, he thought), crept into his bed and let the dark current take him away.He had a vivid dream where he had the name of Yakov Golyadkin (he somehow knew he had become a titular councillor), and he was in a gunfight in a large and deserted library in the town of Babel with a well-built man called Mondego, whom wore a gold-braided uniform with a high stand-up collar, chamois trousers and a plumed hat. Mondego had a Nabokov-47 rifle and a special move called Gravity's Rainbow, while he only had a worn out Meursault rifle and the special move Crime and Punishment. It was clear that Mondego was the better fighter. Golyadkin, however, had aflame an indestructible feeling of determination and justice, and not fearing death, leapt towards Mondego in his last burst of energy his wounded body would allow. Mondego was taken by surprise. The two faces were only a metre apart. The N47 and MR fired at the same moment - Golyadkin saw, in slow motion, the pale bullet was not made of metal but a swirling infinitude of words, but all the ones he didn't like. The words were...Chabolyov woke up, surprisingly calm and feeling cold - the blankets were off the bed. Without any conscious thought, he picked up his phone and clicked on the 'g' icon. He was in. The new notifications were on the review he wrote a couple of nights ago. His profile was back to normal. There was no message from Mikhail. There was no review on The Book of Disquiet.And from that time onward Major Chabolyov was able to use Goodreads in peace....when all is said and done, one can concede this point or the other and perhaps you can even find...well then you won't find much that isn't on the absurd side somewhere, will you?And yet, if you stop to think for a moment, there's a grain of truth in it. Whatever you may say, these things do happen in this world - rarely, I admit, but they do happen."}, {"userName": "Fernando", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7665532-fernando", "userReview": "En La Nariz, G\u00f3gol lleva el absurdo a su l\u00edmite m\u00e1ximo, pero tambi\u00e9n, demuestra con este cuento fant\u00e1stico y c\u00f3mico pero a la vez, como en Rusia se luchaba por escalar posiciones dentro de la ajustada escala burocr\u00e1tica que se impon\u00eda y a la vez, G\u00f3gol reflexiona sobre como chocan a veces y en forma indefectible ciertas clases sociales y expone lo que sent\u00edan muchas personas ante el \u201cdolor de ya no ser\u201d, degradado socialmente y sobre todo a nivel jer\u00e1rquico en una \u00e9poca en donde puesto se rankeaba de acuerdo a la reforma establecida por el zar Pedro I el grande.

This is not my first reading of Gogol. I read Dead Souls at least a decade ago (and fallen in love with that novel I might add). Similarly, I read The Overcoat years ago. So, why did I find writing this review challenging? Perhaps because I feel like I don\u2019t have anything especially profound to add to it. To be honest, I might have been a bit intimidated by the literary prestige of this story. Countless reviews and articles were written about The Nose. It is such a defining work of literature. What could I possibly add to it? Finally, instead of overthinking this review, I decided to simply write down what I loved about it. It is a book after all. I love writing about books. It shouldn\u2019t be so hard, should it? So, here are five main things I love about this short story: 1. I love the humour in this one. Humour exists on many levels. The Nose is a satirical work on a larger scale. It is an intelligent critique of human obsession with rank and climbing the social ladder. However, it is also wonderfully funny. There are so many comic episodes in this one, from the start of this novel to the end, there is no shortage of ridiculous and deliciously absurd episodes. At the very start, the reflections of barber Ivan and his wife made me giggle, even before the obvious absurdity of finding a nose in a bread. When Ivan tries to get rid of the nose, but fails miserably, one can\u2019t help but to sympathize with him and yet the grotesqueness of the situation makes it quite entertaining. I mean it just keeps getting better from then on. My personal favourite episode is probably when major Kovaylor visits newspaper office to place an ad about his missing nose. Gogol is a master of comic situations, no doubt about that. His talent really shines in this short story. 2.\t I love all the characters in this novel. There isn\u2019t that many of them, this is a shorter work, not a novel, but somehow they manage to represent the society of the time perfectly. As is expected from a short story, there is no in-depth analysis of character, but Gogol still does a great job of bringing them into life. From barber Ivan and his nagging wife to the protagonist Kovaylor and his potential hopeful mother-in-law, they are all wonderfully flawed and realistic. Kovaylor\u2019s nose can perhaps also be considered a character in his own right\u2026.and what a character! The scene when the nose appears to be higher in rank that Kovaylor himself is particularly entertaining. Despite the absurdity of the situation, one can\u2019t help but wonder at the motivation behind Kovaylor\u2019s nose actions. What is the nose trying to accomplish? Why is he running away from his owner or better to say himself? I mean the question of identity is brilliantly handled in this one, especially when it comes to our flawed protagonist. Kovaylor and his nose make for a fabulous duo character.3. I love the way the dialogues are written.\tThe dialogues and monologues in this one are simply brilliant. Without so well written dialogues, this short story would lose its realistic feel. Indeed, it is the realistic tone contrasted with the obviously surreal aspect of the story that probably makes it such an accomplished work of literature. The striking contrast adds volumes to the story. The dialogues help it all flow. I would count the letters exchange between major Kovaylor\u2019s and Madame Potchorina as dialogues as well. Those letters are very entertaining, aren\u2019t they? Finally, I really enjoyed Kovaylor\u2019s monologues. The protagonist in his inner monologues reveals himself as man obsessed with his outer appearance. What is a man without his nose? This question turns into a philosophical one.4.\tThe originality of the idea. I mean there is no doubt that the idea is pretty original. Nobody mixes nonsense with sense quite so well as Gogol. The question of identity and the outer perception is masterfully handled but Gogol doesn\u2019t stop at that. Some even consider this story to be the first work of magic realism. I can\u2019t think of another similar work and link it to that time period. It is certainly something quite unique. The writing style is distinctly Gogol\u2019s and that adds to the originality of the story. I mean Gogol\u2019s certainly had an original artistic vision in all of his writing, and his short story is no exception but here he seems to push it to another level. Who else could have come up with those comic and absurd episodes? That all being said, there is still something very unique about the idea itself. 5.\tI love the timelessness of The Nose. Gogol's genius perhaps lies primarily in creating a surreal story that not only feels real, but manages to speak to us on so many levels. It is satire, but it manages to raise very serious questions. It is satire, but it is also wonderfully funny. The Nose is timeless really. You can put it within the historical context and that certainly adds an addition value to it but even on its own, it is an impressive piece of writing.

In it more than anywhere else Gogol displays his extraordinary magic power of making great comic art out of nothing.Critics note that the story's title in Russian (\u041d\u043e\u0441, \"Nos\") is the reverse of the Russian word for \"dream\" (\u0421\u043e\u043d, \"Son\"). As the unreliable narrator himself notes, the story \"contains much that is highly implausible\", while an earlier version of the story ended with Kovalyov waking and realizing that the story was indeed a dream. Without the awakening, however, the story becomes a precursor of magical realism, as an unreal element is woven into a realistic narration. Peace also notes that some critics have interpreted the story as referring to a castration complex: the removal of Kovalyov's nose (and its developing a mind of its own) threaten both his chances of acquiring a position of power and of being a success with women.Some days you wake up and something\u2026 just feels off, you know? Like you're not quite yourself, or like you're not living the life you're supposed to be living, or like there's another kind of you inside your body that wants to burst through your skin.\"The Nose\" takes that out-of-body feeling that everyone's been through and just literalizes the business out of out. You've felt like you could be a higher achiever? Well, this dude's nose pops off his face and makes that ambition happen, baby. Wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am: that nose accomplishes more in a day than its owner has in his whole lifetime\u2014and of course makes that owner feel pretty inconsequential and embarrassed in the process.And even cooler? Gogol's story is pretty much the granddaddy of the many, many stories that play on this idea of a shared identity or a double that comes to take over another character's life, usually in some really creepy way. Think Dostoevsky's \"The Double,\" Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Kafka's Metamorphosis, all the way through Invasion of the Body Snatchers and all the evil-twin subplots that pop up in comic books and sci fi."}, {"userName": "Andr\u00e9", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27068330-andr", "userReview": "Se come\u00e7\u00e1ssemos por Gogol e ent\u00e3o l\u00eassemos Kafka, j\u00e1 n\u00e3o estranhar\u00edamos tanto o segundo. Tanto num como noutro, o absurdo \u00e9-nos entregue como facto, solto, n\u00e3o havendo lugar a explica\u00e7\u00f5es ou esclarecimentos. Ano e meio ap\u00f3s ter lido O Processo fafkiano, continuo a perguntar-me: por que raio foi Josef K. alvo de uma acusa\u00e7\u00e3o cujo fundamento nunca lhe foi revelado? E no momento a seguir logo me lembro que, no fundo, perguntas como essa n\u00e3o t\u00eam a menor relev\u00e2ncia para a hist\u00f3ria. O mesmo se passa aqui: que importa que um nariz ganhe vida e decida deambular por a\u00ed de fato e gravata, liberto daquele a quem pertence?

Diz o autor no fim, e bem, que incongru\u00eancias acontecem por toda a parte, acontecimentos que n\u00e3o se explicam. T\u00e3o absurdas quanto esta? Raramente, sim... mas acontecem!
