Unlike the other books, this one focused only on the main couple. The other couples/characters that we've grown to love over the course of the series didn't take up page time like they normally do and I loved that.These books are the perfect \"getting into the holiday spirit\" type of read. They have a quaint, almost Hallmark-movie type feel to them that leaves me feeling uplifted. That said, I don't think I'd have the patience to read them, as they're not as couple centered as I prefer in my romances. However, I've loved listening to them as I go about my day."}, {"userName": "Auntee", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/886675-auntee", "userReview": "This was a really sweet, tender romance, that had me in tears sometimes, but put a smile on my face at the end.This is the story of Marcie Sullivan, a young widow, and former Marine Ian Buchanan. Marcie recently lost her Marine husband, Bobby, due to injuries he suffered while serving in Iraq. Bobby and Marcie were childhood buddies, then sweethearts, before marrying as teenagers. Bobby enlisted in the military, while Marcie worked in an insurance office. They were in love and had a bright future ahead of them until one day Bobby was severly injured in Iraq from a car bomb explosion. If it wasn't for his Sergeant and best friend, Ian Buchanan, who hauled him to safety amidst enemy fire, he surely would have died on the streets of Fallujah. And even though Bobby never recovered from his injuries, and basically was totally incapacitated, Marcie was grateful for the additional three years she got to spend taking care of Bobby and just being with him. It's been a year since Bobby's death, and Marcie would like to move forward with her life, and get a little closure. But in order to do that, she needs to track down her husband's best friend from the military, Ian Buchanan, and thank him again for saving Bobby and give him a few momentos she thinks Bobby would like him to have. It might be a tall order, because it seems Ian has dropped off the face of the earth.Since that day in Fallujah 4 years ago, Ian's life hasn't been the same. He had planned to serve 20 years in the Marines, but after he saved Bobby and sentenced him to a life as a total invalid, he suffered such enormous guilt that he let it wreck his life and his career. Once a well-liked and respected man with a bright future, he broke up with his fiancee, got in meaningless fights with other soldiers, and was basically forced out of the Marines. He wishes he had let Bobby die in Fallujah, thinking he has sentenced him and his family to more grief than they would have suffered if he had just died on the battlefield. Ian decides to just drop out of life for a while, living a minimal existence selling firewood on a mountaintop near the small California town of Virgin River.With a little luck and some dogged persistence, Marcie tracks Ian to the quaint little town of Virgin River. She hears rumors about a mountain man who likes to whistle and sing and lives hermit-like in a small cabin just outside of town. Could this be Ian?When Marcie meets up with Ian, he is almost unrecognizable from the picture of the handsome man she carries with her. With his dark hair tied back in a long ponytail, a bushy red beard and wearing tattered clothes, and living in a small one room cabin without indoor plumbing, Ian looks and acts like a dropout from life. He tells Marcie he just wants to be left alone, but of course Marcie, being the stubborn girl she is, will not hear of it. She's determined to break through all the walls Ian has placed around himself. She only has a few weeks before she's due home for Christmas--will that be enough time for her to convince Ian to rejoin the world and start living again? And can she help Ian heal his wounded heart? And will Marcie learn something about herself in the process?While this wasn't my favorite of all the Virgin River books, it certainly was enjoyable. It was fun to revisit that small California town again--after Marcie's first encounter with some of the residents, it was like I never left. Some of the past characters have small roles, including Preacher and Paige, Mike and Brie, Doc, and with larger roles, Mel and Jack. ********possible spoiler******************* I like that a romance between Marcie and Ian didn't happen right away, although now that I think of it, 10 days is pretty fast! But it just seemed that Marcie and Ian got to know a lot about each other in that time, and each also knew a lot about the other through Bobby's letters home and Marcie's letters to Bobby. And once Ian came home with a hair-cut and a closely trimmed beard, I knew the fireworks would start to happen between the two! And they did--they provided a lot of 'heat' for that small, one-room cabin! There were some tear-jerking moments too, when Marcie relates the circumstances of Bobby's death, and when Ian lets Marcie go home for Christmas. I wanted him to beg her to stay!*********************************************************** The ending was heart-warming and beautiful, but I could have used a few pages more, to let me in on what would happen in the future. But that is not a problem--I'm sure Robyn Carr will cover that ground in her next Virgin River novel, titled \"Second Chance Pass\" due out in February 2009. That's one I can't wait to read!"}, {"userName": "Penny Watson", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2424608-penny-watson", "userReview": "Nothing brings me more hope, more excitement, more anticipation for a romance novel than........finding out the hero has a beard!!!! Hallelujah!So, imagine my everlasting surprise and happiness when I discovered that the hero for Robyn Carr's A Virgin River Christmas has a beard. And not just any ol' beard, but a full-on, hard-core, lumber jack-style beard. And....it's red!(Please take a moment of silence to process this wonderful ditty).In spite of the fact that I don't love contemporary romance, I am loving this series. The characters are wonderful, the love stories incredibly satisfying, and the setting is rugged, natural, earthy....it's a great combination. This book was freaking fantastic! I didn't think Carr could create a better hero than Preacher, but I absolutely adore Ian! He roars like a wounded wild animal, and then gently, quietly feeds a deer from his hand. Swooning here, people. Swooning!Ian and Marcie's story is perfectly done....their love unfolds slowly and believably as they bond in his tiny cabin. It is wonderful to see how Marcie helps to pull him out of his isolation and introduces him to the world again. Their love is healing, powerful and transforming. The scene at the end of the book when Ian sings in front of the memorial Christmas tree is astounding. One of the best scenes I've ever read. Robyn Carr is a true master of romance.Grade: A+++++++ (can you tell I liked this one? hee hee.....)"}, {"userName": "Beanbag Love", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2598237-beanbag-love", "userReview": "I'm not sure of the circumstances of this book's release, but it was about a hundred pages shorter than the one previous. It definitely had a 'novella' feel to it, and there weren't really any side stories going on, so I'm thinking it might have appeared first in an anthology.No matter, it's very good and might even be my favorite of the first four. A young widow is searching for her late husband's former best friend who has dropped off the map entirely after leaving the Marine Corps.Ian Buchanan has become your basic mountain man. He saved his best friend, Bobby's, life in Falluja only to find that Bobby had ended up a quadriplegic in what amounted to a persistent vegetative state. Just the boot to kick Ian into emotional and mental chaos. Marcie is a little firebrand who needs closure after three years of nursing Bobby until his final, peaceful breath. I was really impressed with this character. She was funny, loving, compassionate, incredibly strong and more stubborn than anything. Definitely my favorite character of the series so far, and probably in the top five female characters I've read this year. It was fascinating to see this person who basically made the world turn for so many being thought of as the one who needed to be handled with fragile care. She, naturally, chafes at it as much as the reader does for her, and it makes for some pretty good moments. I cried more reading this than any of the others. This was a really excellently written story, I thought, and the joy of the romance against the backdrop of grief and isolation was very satisfying.It loses half a star for no epilogue (I rounded up). It ends right before something I feel we either needed to see or hear about after the fact. Perhaps these two show up again in the rest of the series -- I certainly hope so, but don't tell me! -- but I want to know what happened next. It felt like the story was unfinished.But if you make it this far in the series, there's no way you're NOT going to read on, so just enjoy."}, {"userName": "Anna's Herding Cats", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5417092-anna-s-herding-cats", "userReview": "One of the best romance books ever. This was my second time reading A Virgin River Christmas and, yall, this book. You need to read this book. It's everything. The Gist: Marcie's husband died a year ago after being injured while deployed. And she's determined to find his best friend and the man who risked everything to save him years earlier and then disappeared. Seriously. Marcie and Ian. They're incredible. Marcie is a force to be reckoned with. She's lovely and kind. Sweet, fiery, full of faith and hope. Has a will of steel. She was wonderful. And Ian. He's such a good man but lost. His life fell apart years earlier and to cope with it he ran and became more or less a recluse. Living tucked away in the mountains in a rustic cabin with no electricity or comforts. He's hard working but keeps to himself. Cut off from anything gentle or easy, from nearly all forms of relationships. He's resourceful, quiet and underneath his wild mountain man exterior he's gentle and caring and lonely. Their romance was very slow going. They're both dealing with such loss and having trouble moving on. Finding who they are and used to be. Marcie having to get him to even let her in the door and then slowly over the weeks pulling more out of him. Getting him to talk, to leave his mountain, to enjoy things and reconnect with people. It was just incredible and touching. Seeing them form a connection again and finally find a way to heal from the loss of her husband and his best friend. They have a total beauty and the beast vibe going. My only issue was that Carr cannot get Marine right. Half the time it's not capitalized and it should ALWAYS be capitalized no matter if it's the branch or the individual. But other than that A Virgin River Christmas is a moving romance that'll bring you to tears and leave you full of hope and wonder. Really you just need to read this one. You need to meet these two. See their journey and their incredible strength and resilience. It's such an experience and a simple review can't do it justice.

Anyways, this isn\u2019t the type of contemporary romance I usually read (I like a bit of action, suspense or the occasional vampire in my mix) However the Virgin River series is so hugely popular and was recommended to me by a ton of people so I just had to check it out. ...And I\u2019m happy to say that except for the author\u2019s unusual fixation with an outhouse I got sucked right into this heart tugging romance. Enough so that I didn\u2019t want to read anything else when I finished and have gone back to start the series at the beginning.Yes this is book #4 in a series of 13 (and counting) however that doesn't seem to have any bearing on this particular story (I think because it\u2019s a special Christmas edition). Sure there were a few characters I might have enjoyed more if I\u2019d know their \u2018story\u2019 but this stood just fine on its own and centered pretty much solely on Ian and Marcie\u2019s heartbreaking journey of love and healing. The best word I could use to describe Robyn Carr\u2019s writing is comfortable. It\u2019s just relaxed and easy and felt like I was reading about friends or I imagine if you\u2019re well into the series like coming home. Carr never once had me shaking my head thinking that\u2019s wrong or ridiculous or the H/h would never do that. The story flows very well too, is funny in parts and heart wrenching in others and except for letting the outhouse become a character of its own, left me wanting more. I feel like Carr could become the sort of author I\u2019d pick up when nothing else is striking my fancy and know that I\u2019d enjoy it. Marcie Sullivan is looking for closure; she\u2019s come to Virgin River to find her husbands Sergeant and best friend. The man responsible for saving Bobby in Iraq and giving her three years to say goodbye while he slowly died from his battle injuries. As Marcie cared for her husband she forged a friendship (through letters) with his sergeant Ian, pouring out her heart, frustrations and sadness to a man she\u2019d never met. Then suddenly the letters stopped and soon her husband was gone too. Now a year later Marcie still can\u2019t seem to move on with her life, she\u2019s decided she has to find Ian. To talk to him about what happened over there and make sure he\u2018s okay.But locating Ian hasn\u2019t been easy, nobody\u2019s seen him for years and his family has all but written him off. After following several leads Marcie at last finds her hero but he doesn\u2019t want to be found and definitely doesn\u2019t want to be reminded of Iraq. Ian\u2019s living far off the grid of society, a recluse in a rundown cabin in the woods with no amenities. Yes that\u2019s right an\u2026outhouse (dun dun dah) Ian Growls at Marcie to leave him alone, sounding much like the bear he now resembles what with all that hair but Marcie refuses to go until she completes her mission. Of course this leads to her almost freezing to death, catching hypothermia and Ian having to save and care for her until she\u2019s better (It is a romance after all)Marcie\u2019s character is a bit of a goof and I really liked her and her adventures with living in a rustic cabin. I found it odd though that suffering a burn from not knowing how to light propane stove was hilarious while a flu/cold was a matter of life and death? I also didn\u2019t find this quite as romantic as I\u2019m sure others will as I have lived in the bush without power and it loses its appeal mighty fast especially in the winter. So while some might think it quaint that they cook on a woodstove, and read by candlelight, I cringed. Anyways you don\u2019t need to know much else, all the townsfolk turn up in one way or another and Marcie and Ian forge into a new type of friendship, one with benefits. Oh and it all happens right around Christmas.

I read it on my computer using Kindle for Mac. Because I just don't spend enough time with my computer, you know?This book tells the story of Ian Buchanan, an emotionally scarred former Marine, and Marcie Sullivan, widow of Ian's best friend, who died from injuries sustained while at war despite Ian's attempt to save him. Set in the snowy mountains above Virgin River, it brings together so many things that make the Virgin River series so enjoyable \u2014 the remote mountain setting, the sense of community, and the strong men and women who make up that community.Marcie has been searching for Ian, feeling that there is unfinished business between them. As her husband's best friend, Ian should have been there during the three years her husband lingered between life and death. Instead, Ian had vanished. Marcie wants to know why \u2014 and she wants to give him her husband's baseball card collection. Truth is, she's not sure why she's searching for him. She is driven by needs she doesn't completely understand.The man she meets is not the man she remembers. With a heavy beard and a nasty temper, Ian has been hiding in a cabin in the mountains, living an unadorned life as a hermit \u2014 no ties, no toilet, no contact with the outside world. Ian knows who Marcie is \u2014 he met her at one point when he came back from the war while her husband was in a long-term care facility \u2014 but he wants nothing to do with her. He does his best to drive her away and acting a bit nuts in the process.But Marcie becomes ill, and Ian has no choice but to take care of her. The ten days that follow as she regains her health transform both of them. Watching Marcie and Ian face their shared pain together, finding love and healing in each other's arms, was wonderful, even if Marcie at times seemed a little too perfect. The love story is sweet, as are the love scenes. The emotion feels genuine. I found myself forgiving Marcie's PITA older sister, Erin, as I learned why she was a PITA. It was great to see the other characters again \u2014 Mel and Jack; Paige and Preacher; Doc, etc. (I haven't read Brie and Mark Venezuela's story yet...) The sense of community that permeates these stories is so addictive. Who wouldn't want to live in a town where everyone cared about everyone else? Heck, I'd pack my junk tomorrow if I knew of such a place. It's pretty far removed from the world I know, I must say.I love to read Christmas-themed romances, but most often I read historicals. There's something about the Christmas season that makes historicals particularly enjoyable. This is the first contemporary romance I've read with a Christmas theme, and I enjoyed it. I still prefer Christmas historicals, but then historicals are what I love to read most anyway.For those who haven't read the Virgin River series or who've read only a few, this book stands alone. I think a person could read it and then go back and pick up at the beginning.Over all, a very enjoyable and satisfying read. I will admit to sneaking some reading time in while at work. D'oh!"}, {"userName": "jenjn79", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/946249-jenjn79", "userReview": "I have to admit I had an initial smidge of disappointment when I realized this book didn't feature existing Virgin River characters, but introduced two new ones. But I quickly got over it because the new characters were interesting, and the old ones had big enough supporting roles to make you feel the connection to the previous books.Like the other books, this one has a slight military theme in the characters. Marcie Sullivan was widowed a year ago when her Marine husband Bobby died three years after sustaining devastating injuries in Iraq. Since then, she's felt stuck in a rut, unable to go forward, and obviously unable to go back. And she can't stop thinking that if she could find Bobby's best friend and superior, Ian Buchanan, and settle some things with him, that maybe she'd finally find her way. She'd only ever met him a few times, but she'd come to know him through the letters they'd exchanged and from what Bobby had told her about him. But then Ian had disappeared after he left the Marines not long after Bobby's injury, and Marcie knows he must be hiding from the emotional scars he's suffered. She thinks if she can just find him and talk to him, help him move on, then she would be able to as well. But things don't go quite a planned when she finally does manage to locate him near the quaint mountain town of Virgin River.True, this is a romance, but honestly, it doesn't come into play until fairly late in the book. A lot of this story is about the characters and their emotional dramas. There were a couple scenes that brought tears to my eyes - especially the one where Marcie flashes back to Bobby's death. I had to go dig up some tissues. That was so sad.But even though the romance is late in developing, this was an enjoyable book to read (for romance readers). The characters are fantastic. I liked Marcie - though I wished she'd learned to stand up to her sister a little better. And Ian was rather interesting, with his wild, mountain-man look, but gentle and kind heart, and an amazing singing voice. He's such a contradiction. And though they didn't hook up till late, you could feel the connection between Ian and Marcie from the start. They just had to work their way to the right point.I also really enjoyed how the characters from past Virgin River books had more than just passing roles. Jack and Mel had a fairly active part of the story, and Preacher, Paige, Mike and Bree all had varying smaller roles. It was great to catch up with all those characters.I had only one or two quibbles with things. I wished the ending had been a little more settled, maybe an epilogue to give us some idea how things went with Ian's reentry into the normal world. Hopefully Carr with update us on them in the upcoming new set of VC books. The only other thing that bothered me was that once Marcie and Ian did hook up, they were together a lot, but there was never once a mention of birth control. It just annoyed me a little bit to have something that important ignored.Anyway, A Virgin River Christmas is a nice edition to the Virgin River series. It's a great people story with just enough romance to satisfy those of us who like our HEA's. And after read the sneak peak of Second Chance Pass, the upcoming VC novel, I can't wait to read it!"}, {"userName": "\u2661Karlyn P\u2661", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1131400-karlyn-p", "userReview": "Finished it in one sitting.

Her willingness to adapt to the rugged lifestyle of the mountains made for several good laughs. The premise of her being in Virigin River to help her dead husbands best friend (Ian) was a bit of a stretch, but it really worked. When they finally came together I melted. This book is a stand alone so you don't need to read the series in order for this one, but you will get to see a bit of Jack, Mel, Preacher, Mike, Brie...etc. I really wish this book had a huge epilouge as I wanted to know more about how life works out for these two.

His heroism earned him the the highest honors from the US government but when he came home and saw Bobby's broken body, he believed he had selfishly sentenced him to a life trapped in a useless cage. He couldn't stand the guilt and left. Ian knew his friend had died that day in Fallujah, but he wouldn't leave his fallen brother behind. In his mind, he has not only sentenced Bobby to life as an invalid, he also destroyed the life of Bobby's young and vibrant wife. But Marcie Sullivan is incredibly grateful to Ian. Not only did her husband's best friend save his life, he enabled her to spend three more years with him before he finally passed on. Ian allowed her to have closure so often denied military widows and now, almost a year to the date of Bobby's death, she wants closure with Ian. She wants to know why her husband's best friend disappeared and she's determined to find him and let him know how much he meant to her and Bobby. Just thinking about this book is making me teary eyed again. Get out your hanky because if you're anything like me, you're going to end up a sobbing wreck. Marcie was the toughest little girl on the playground and as an adult, she's as tenacious as a bulldog. She fearlessly sets out on her mission to find Ian and she doesn't let things like no food and no gas money stop her. Her meandering search brings her to the town of Virgin River and lo and behold, she finds Ian. Only this mountainman looks nothing like the cleanshaven, handsome marine she remembers. This man is huge and scruffy plus a touch crazy. It appears Ian might have been isolated up in the mountains for too long because when he sees Marcie, he honest to God roars at her. Make no mistake about it, Ian is a bum. Robyn Carr takes us out of the charmingly rustic, country elegance of Jack's Bar and drops us in hillbilly hell. Ian lives in a shack that doesn't have indoor plumbing and he hasn't had an actual shower in years. If he wants to hit the head during the winter he has to shovel his way through the snow to get to it. But not only does Robyn Carr make me forget all that, she makes me like it. She's woven another warm and cozy story and I loved every second of it. Ian is as trapped in his own pain as Bobby was trapped in his body and when Marcie bursts back into his world, I loved reading about how she slowly charmed him back to life. Most of A Virgin River Christmas is about Ian and Marcie, and the town of Virgin River and all of our favorite characters play only a small part. This begins during the middle of Whispering Rock and since all our favorite characters are busy during their own stories at the time, this leaves Ian and Marcie very much on their own. I actually appreciated that and I liked focusing on just one couple again and since Ian and Marcie were fun to be with, it was certainly not a hardship. The humor in A Virgin River Christmas is still as fun as any previous book. This one will make you laugh and I suggest you enjoy it because this one will also make you cry like never before. I honestly wanted to grab onto any soldier I could find and just give them a hug and say, \"thank you.\" This story ends on a beautiful note. The happily ever after between Ian and Marcie still has a few rough roads ahead but I closed this book feeling better and happier than I did before reading it, so I highly recommend this as yet another must have book by Robyn Carr. A Virgin River Christmas will make you cry and and then make you laugh and will leave you with the knowledge and hope that everything will be all right again"}, {"userName": "Christa", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/261662-christa", "userReview": "This was a very sweet, tender love story that seemed entirely appropriate for a Christmas book. I didn't like it quite as well as the three previous books in the series, but it was still a wonderful story. I am anxiously anticipating the next book in the series.It has been a year since the death of her husband, but Marcie Sullivan is just unable to move forward with her life. She feels that she needs closure that will come from locating her husband's best friend and former superior officer, Ian Buchanan. Four years ago, Ian risked his life to save Bobby in Iraq. Bobby suffered paralysis and extreme brain damage, and after one visit to Bobby four years ago, Ian broke off contact and disappeared. Marcie travels through numerous small California mountain towns in search of Ian after hearing that he is living as a hermit in the woods. Spending an entire month searching exhausts Marcie and her finances, but she finally finds Ian, who is extremely unfriendly and unwilling to talk to her. When he realizes that she is ill, Ian reluctantly takes Marcie in and cares for her. Ian feels that he did Bobby an injustice by saving his life only to sentence him to three years of total impairment, and he is unable to get past this. Ian has other issues that have helped to cause his reclusive behavior. As Marcie and Ian spend the enforced time together while she recovers, they get to know and care for one another. After they become intimately involved, Ian will have to decide if he is willing to risk being part of the world again in order to continue a relationship with Marcie.This was an emotional, touching book. The reason I did not like this book quite as much as the others in the series is that it did not have enough closure for me. I felt that Ian still had too much doubt about himself and whether he could have a successful relationship with Marcie. I would also have liked to see the story continue enough to give some idea of what Ian planned to do with his future. I hope that the next books will give a little more information about what is happening to Ian and Marcie. It was wonderful to read a bit more about the Virgin River characters from the previous books of this great series."}, {"userName": "Quinn", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2310262-quinn", "userReview": "My love affair with this series (and its talented author) is still going strong. I really enjoyed A Virgin River Christmas. The author managed to tell a full and meaningful tale in just 285 pages. This is one of the very few times where I can say of a novella that nothing was lacking. The characters were fully developed, the story had depth and emotion, and I finished fully satisfied. If I had to nitpick, I could have done with a bit more at the ending, but I have faith that the author will pick up their story in future books. I doubt this will be the last we see of Marcie and Ian.At 27 years old, Marcie has been a widow for 12 months. But she really lost her husband 3 years prior to that, when he returned from Iraq in a vegetative state. Marcie feels unable to move on until she finds closure with her husband\u2019s Sergeant and best friend Ian, who risked his life to save her husband, then disappeared 3 years ago.Marcie tracks Ian to Virgin River, where she finds a wild-man whose crippling emotional wounds contrast the physical injuries suffered by her husband.While we do see glimpse of past Virgin River citizens in Jack and Mel, Preacher and Paige, Mike and Brie and, of course, Doc, this story is firmly focused on Marcie and Ian, and is by turns funny, sad, touching and uplifting.There are no pregnancies or women\u2019s health issues in this one, but the author always provides bare-faced reality in her stories, and this time it is the difficulties of living in the wilderness without modern conveniences.I\u2019ve said it before, but I\u2019ll say it again. I am so pleased to have discovered this author. It\u2019s so hard to find good, straight contemporary romance. Nora Roberts is no longer waving that flag for me on her lonesome.While A Virgin River Christmas, as the author acknowledges in her letter to readers, can be read as a standalone, this is one great series, so if you haven\u2019t already, I would strongly recommend you go back to the beginning."}, {"userName": "Kathrynn", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/669573-kathrynn", "userReview": "There wasn't a whole lot to this short book (285 pages) and there was some filler left in the story (explaining something, then explaining it again) or possibly the book needed a good edit. The main characters were all right. Ian turned himself into a recluse and chose to live--alone--on the mountain in a cabin without any amenities. He was almost barbaric with the roaring... Marcie's character was very likable and I admired her fortitude in sticking with her goal of finding Ian--despite the lack of sibling support. (Erin needed to get a life). The author says in the beginning that this would be a great story to pick up and begin the series...I disagree. If I had not read (and loved) the Virgin River series I would have hated this book. As it was, what I enjoyed most was reading about the previous series characters. Mel and Jack (my favorites), Mike and Brie, Paige and John (Preacher), Doc, etc., were all in this one. The main plot to this story just did not hold my interest: tortured past from the hero; invalid war hero and subsequent death; war and all its horrors; reclusive mountain people, grouchy old men. And it could have used another chapter or two to finish the blasted story! The story had me boo-hooing through some very sad parts near the ending, so it touched me emotionally; that's the justification for 4 stars from This Reader."}, {"userName": "KarenH", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2609870-karenh", "userReview": "This is the first time I've found a hero most unappealing and still felt the book deserved 5 stars. The hero in a story is usually the draw for me, but being so invested in the Virgin River series, I knew I was getting a rangy, unkempt mountain man and wanted to read the book anyway. Wise decision, KarenH!Ian Buchanan has been living a hermit's life on an isolated mountain since he turned his back on civilization 5 years ago. Discharged from the Marines, Ian was unable to deal with real-life situations that he perceived to be gross injustices...particularly the fact that while serving in Iraq, although he had saved his best friend's life, the friend, Bobby, was severely injured and lived the last three years of his young life totally paralyzed and in a catatonic state. And Ian received a medal of honor for that??? His fiancee couldn't comprehend anything beyond the wedding she was planning and his father was an old, pessimistic bastard that found fault with everything his son did. So Ian had walked away from it all and was living in a rural cabin on a desolate mountain far off the beaten path...when Marcie Sullivan, Bobby's widow, tracked him down.Ian growled and roared and made a lot of noise trying to scare Marcie away but the feisty, five-foot-nothing redhead wasn't buying it. She had been searching for Ian for what felt like an eternity and all the scare tactics he could muster up were not enough to sway her from her mission...she wanted to tell Ian that Bobby had passed away, she wanted to give him Bobby's cherished baseball card collection, she wanted to make sure he was alright, but most of all she wanted to get to know the man that Bobby had loved and respected..the man who had risked his own life to save Bobby's.Ian finally gave in and told Marcie she could stay overnight but he wanted her off the mountain in the morning. No such luck, however, because Marcie woke up with the flu. Ian nursed her back to health over the next few days, and his urgency for her to leave - his need to be alone - was all but forgotten. Ian & Marcie eased into an amiable relationship and got to know each other well as the story progressed. Although I was having trouble picturing Ian as someone other than ZZ Top, Marcie didn't seem to mind. And by the time they have sex, there is no doubt they are very much in love. But now what? Marcie has a life in the city and Ian still wants no part of all that. Will they be able to accept their relationship is nothing more than a fling and go their separate ways? This book is, by far, the most emotional read of the series. When Marcie is describing her life with Bobby as an invalid - only not in depression but with the joy she felt for having him 3 more years - I was a goner.\nI doubt anyone could read that part and not be moved by it, as it brings to mind this senseless fucking war...how many wonderful young lives have been cut short and families left to bear the overwhelming sorrow. Robyn Carr does an excellent job of looking at it through Marcie's bittersweet perspective - sadness for losing her beloved husband, Bobby...her big, strong man so full of life; yet happiness for the extension of his life that had been granted...time that she, as well as Bobby's parents and siblings, needed to say goodbye.The one problem I continue to have with this series is the deluge of bitchy women. Mel Sheridan, queen of the Virgin River bitches, would have had \"bitch as the secondary character\" role all to herself in AVRC but (and this is hard to believe but true) her bitchiness is eclipsed by that of Marcie's sister, Erin. O.M.G. what a shrew! It's a good thing I read Erin's story, Angel's Peak, before I read AVRC because with this lead-in alone, I would've hated Erin and been forced to bypass an installment of my favorite series. Fortunately, Erin leaves her \"bitchy, overbearing shrew is why you can't find a husband\" demeanor behind when she returns to Virgin River on vacation.It is no wonder that the Virgin River series is as successful and much-read at book 14 as it was at book 1 because Ms. Carr continues to keep the story lines fresh. The characters may be repetitive but each story is unique..even if the premise isn't. Book 5 of the series, Second Chance Pass, utilizes the same \"heroine falls in love with best friend of husband who was killed in Iraq\" theme but that is the only similarity between the two stories. IMO that really says something about RC's amazing talent because I can't think of one other multi-published author that has written 2 completely different stories with the same theme...much less 2 completely different stories with different themes!In fewer words, Robyn Carr, you rock!May the love continue to flow down that ol' Virgin River!"}, {"userName": "Shabby Girl ~ aka Lady Victoria", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3453168-shabby-girl-aka-lady-victoria", "userReview": "UPDATED: 16/12/2014 I decided to reread this book for my Christmas read, since it has stuck in my mind as such a lovely book I haven't forgotten since I read it about three years ago. I was right to remember it as on rereading it I found that it really is one of the loveliest books I've ever read and it did confirm what I originally thought. I've read so many lovely books in the last few years, but you tend to forget most of them, but some really do stand out and you remember them for it, and this is one of those books. I'm putting this one in my reread pile to read again in maybe another two or three years.On my original review of saying these books are bloody fabulous, after having read a few, they are a tad hit and miss for me, some work wonderfully, such as this one (which I think had a bit to do with no second, third, fourth romances running along with it and concentrating on the main couple, and some don't work so well for me. I know this author can write wonderful heroines, such as Marcie in this book, but some just seem bitchy to me, not strong, and whenever she throws those ones in, the books just don't work for me. Sometimes too when she has a bitchy heroine it is tough because she runs so many threads through these books I just have to miss some of the good stuff to avoid the heroines I don't like. She never writes a bad hero, but some the heroines .... mmm, no.Mel could use a seat too, she crosses the line for me time and time again with the bossiness, sticking her nose into people's business and preachiness.

I liked Ian, and seeing other members of the VR community was fun, but I didn't warm up to Marcie, probably because I didn't really get her. I don't understand why she felt she had the right to intrude on a virtual stranger's life to demand answers, to understand his life. Yes, she'd met him a couple of times and yes, he was her husband's best friend. But after years of unanswered letters to him she should have just left him alone. Of course it all worked out in the end, but I still feel like she had no right to find him and no right to understand him. There is a small scene in another book I read right afterwards that I feel fits the situation...Step mother talking to step daugther about s-d's new (and somewhat damaged husband) - \"You think if you can bring order to Mr. McBride's life, he will be well. He is in disaray and you must fix him. But people can't be fixed, especially not men like Mr. McBride. Not in the way you mean. You have to undertand and help him, dear. Not repair him.\" Substitute Ian instead of Mr. McBride and it helps explain how I feel. Marcie felt she had this right to dig into his psyche, to understand why he disappeared from life (in the scene above, at least the wife had the right to understand, as she was his wife) - but that's not her business. Even if she did help heal him in the end, help him understand that what he did (saving her husband) was a good thing, it still was not her place to barrel her way, uninvited, into his life and demand answers. It just bugged me. Also, she went snooping in his stuff to find her letters that she'd written him - I don't like that! I know I'm in the minority here, but to me, Marcie was pushy and overbearing - and it just didn't work for me that she'd go w/o money, away from her family, sleeping in her car, to find this guy she really knows nothing about."}, {"userName": "Michelle [Helen Geek]", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5557851-michelle-helen-geek", "userReview": "Another 3.5 Stars for me.I liked so many things about this book, but am giving it 3.5 stars because I was bored in places and found myself skimming [never good for me].What did I like:1 -- the author addressing the real issue of our fighting troops and the people who love and care for them.2 -- the courage Marcie had in searching for Ian against all odds.3 -- the Holiday theme [wish I'd read it at Christmas]. Love, love, loved the Christmas tree and all it represented.4 -- the love of this community.I really liked much about this story, but there was a depth missing. It is almost like the author has so many characters to keep up with and she has to weave each into the story, it loses depth for the main characters. Plus, as poignant as this particular topic was, I felt she could have spent more time on it. The topic being the fragile human condition after returning from a war front. Of course we expect the troop to be impacted, but not much thought given to those supporting and loving the returning individual. So heart wrenching.Overall, a good story, but could have been more [my opinion].

You get to know them extremely well, even though this book is much shorter than the rest. I believe this was a great story, couldn't put it down, not for even a second. Kept reading it until 6 a.m,lol. But I'm on holidays, so I guess that's fine.Well I really do recommend this series. I loved Ian, he was that kind of hero you love to read about. All rough, sexy and in need of someone to just simply care. He had some issues but nothing too overreacted, just the right amount for his heroine to save him,lol.And Marcie was really an amazing heroine.

While still set near Virgin River, this book is not about Mel, Jack, Paige etc. while there were some cameos done by the characters I love this one introduced Marcie and Ian. I absolutely loved these two, they were adorable! Marcie's husband,Bobby, died a year ago after being injured while fighting overseas and spending 3 three years unable to move or speak. Ian was his commanding officer, and the person who saved Bobby after the explosion that nearly killed them both. These two are brought together when Marcie decides that Ian has run away from what happened long enough and his guilt over how Bobby ended up. Let me tell you that this is NOT a love at first sight story, in fact Ian is far from happy that Marice came to find him and remind him of his failure, and the loss of Bobby. Unfortunately for him Marcie gets the flu and stays. And the rest is as they say \"history\"Marcie was great, she didn't let her own fears stop her from doing what she needed to do to move on. She didn't let her family stop her, nor did she let Ian's temper put her off. Nope, she knew what she wanted and went after it, she's another brave woman in the Virgin River series. Ian was a big tough teddy bear, and he really made the story for me. He had so much guilt over not being able to really save Bobby, and reading about him finally trying to deal with that, all while faling in love with his friends widow was endearing. Unlikethe previous books, this one really focuses mostly on the main couple. There are very a few times when other are involved, like Marcie's family, but for the most part it's about forgiving yourself and of course finding love in unexpected places."}, {"userName": "Jonel Boyko", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15432163-jonel-boyko", "userReview": "Carr once again returns to Virgin River with a tale that will melt your heart and have you falling in love. The breathtaking scenery enhances the emotionally turbulent tale, transporting you to the outskirts of Virgin River. This tale tackles some emotionally hard hitting topics, without cutting corners. At the same time, love and friendship shine through creating a whole that I couldn\u2019t look away from. I thoroughly enjoy how Carr portrays her ex-military men. The aura surrounding them as well as their take on life is great and so realistic, showing these alpha males as they truly are.The main characters in this novel at first struck me as an odd pair, but I absolutely love the way that it turned out. Marcie\u2019s strength tempered Ian\u2019s subtle faltering. I loved the way that their emotions played across the page. I will admit that there were more than a few times when I couldn\u2019t tolerate Erin. Although one can understand where she\u2019s coming from, she takes the overprotectiveness to the point of controlling, taking away choices from her siblings. I cheered out loud when Marcie finally stood up to her. And for those of us who enjoy audiobooks as well, I\u2019ve read the print version and listened to the audio book.
