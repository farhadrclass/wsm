In Lysistrata the women of the city-states at war decided they\u2019ve had enough and begin a boycott of sex to compel their husbands and lovers to make peace. In Clouds, a man near financial ruin because of his no-good son\u2019s fondness for luxury decides that a good education by the sophists will help him escape his debts by giving him the power to win any lawsuit. The humor is broad, bawdy to the point of pornographic, explicit where Shakespeare\u2019s bawdiness is suggestive, and filled with fart jokes and the occasional shitting joke. Near the end of Lysistrata, Athenian and Spartan males are walking around with super-sized erections, bent-backed in pain over toting their throbbing phalli about without relief. In other words, what the boys of South Park have come up with is actually several thousand years old. Contemporary folks appear in the plays to be skewered---another commonality with South Park\u2014Cleon, Euripides, and many others whose fame has been made obscure by history. Clouds features an unflattering appearance by Socrates, erroneously included with the sophists as a man arguing for argument\u2019s sake, reminding us that satire is often a blunt instrument. If the father and son in the play weren\u2019t so ridiculous you might view Clouds as an anti-intellectual assault on education and change, but the father and son are squarely in Aristophanes\u2019s sights along with the sophists so it\u2019s not hard to see it as a more embracing social satire. While the father sees the lack of intellectual merit in the sophist approach he delights in its potential benefit, a perpetual get of jail card for any malfeasance. He is greedy, selfish and cynical, not an innocent led astray by new fangled assaults on the old and traditional. Aristophanes is an equal opportunity satirist and like most comedians, if the joke doesn\u2019t fit the crime or the truth of the circumstances but is funny, the joke wins. Purpose takes a back seat to laughs. To that point, much of Aristophanes is very funny; but to be fair, no matter how funny you were at the moment, give or take 2500 years, some jokes lose their freshness and even their meaning\u2014and word to the wise to the translator and editor: explaining jokes, not funny. What works best here is that, tossing aside the topical, Aristophanes\u2019s big themes are as immortal as Zeus, Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite. Themes like war, sex, hypocrisy and human nature are timeless because one indelible characteristic of human nature apparently is we are slow learners. It\u2019s what comedy has in common with tragedy. In the end, we laugh, we cry, but we don\u2019t fully get it until it\u2019s too late. Then comes the pie in the face or the news that our hubris has led to the slaughter of half our family."}, {"userName": "K.C.

No husband can have a happy life if his wife doesn't want him to.\"Men wage war against each other. Women band together in secrecy. A brilliant plot brings about peace.Lysistrata and Other Plays is a collection of Greek comedies in the style of Old Comedy. Old Comedy is the oldest form of Athenian comedy, and it is the ancient ancestor of the comedy enjoyed by audiences today. Old Comedy uses lampooning and satire to call attention to social or political issues, and Aristophanes is the master playwright of this genre.Lysistrata is one of Aristophanes's most well-known plays, and it is an excellent example of Old Comedy, which occasionally uses sexual innuendo as a tactic. The play takes place during the Peloponnesian War. Lysistrata (who is considered the first female hero of Ancient Greek comedy) has grown tired of the fighting. She rallies together women from all over Greece (then divided into small city-states), inviting them to a meeting to discuss how she believes they can end the war: a sex-strike. The wartime celibacy \u2013 which proves very difficult for some of the women involved \u2013 moves the men to consider peace in order to cease their torment. In the end, Lysistrata helps the opposing forces find reconciliation and form a truce. A great, drunken celebration ensues, and the women return to the men. The play, although bawdy and lighthearted, was performed during the very real Peloponnesian War, and Aristophanes used humor to express his feelings about it. By having all the women of Greece band together, Aristophanes places the men on both sides of the war on equal ground. They all experience the same pain and endure the same hardships, revealing that humanity can be found even in the worst of foes in even the most troubling of times. The tension that takes place between the genders also proves helpful to his cause, as he is able to show that, like men and women, Athens and Sparta are inextricably linked by a shared history, and that the well-being of both depends on working out their differences to establish peace.I highly recommend this collection to anyone who enjoys reading comedy, especially satire, or plays in general. I also feel that emerging playwrights or drama students could learn a lot from these classic works."}, {"userName": "Nicole Griffen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48501133-nicole-griffen", "userReview": "Lysistrada and Other Plays was an excellent and hilarious play to read with the withholding sex to encourage ceasefire. This is most defiantly a comedy and there were several moments I found myself laughing out loud because of the language and the way the women would use withholding of sex as a tool to try to get their personal political views noticed. The dynamic between the men and women in the choruses also reveals the dependency between the domestic and political lives of the people in Athens. This comes across as a play that was used as propaganda in order to strengthen the female race of Athenian women.I also found it comical that during the dialogue of the play Lysistrada poked fun at the fact that women are made fun of in poems by stating boldly \u2018What an utterly perverted sex we women are! No wonder poets write tragedies about us.\u2019 (Lines 111&112) my friends and I are often saying the same types of things so it made the play more personable and relatable to me.The men in the play seemed to be in a whirlwind dealing with these women. Kinesias was toyed with in one scene by Myrrhine. She kept getting him all excited and then made excuse after excuse to leave the bed. The only thing she didn\u2019t say is that aunt flow had come to town. Lysistrada and the other ladies in this play were a very witty bunch and the men well let\u2019s just say it in the same way that Kinesias said it they were just trying to get laid after being at war. With all the things that the women did to get the men to end the war the men just viewed them as being playful and playing hard to get, even though the women had a certain agenda in mind when they were withholding sex the men did not see it."}, {"userName": "Alma Segura", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46371626-alma-segura", "userReview": "Lysistrata was defiantly an interesting read, I didn\u2019t love it but I didn\u2019t hate it. From the beginning it gets your attention because of all the sex talk lol. The jokes were something else. However that\u2019s what made the story so captivating, the fact that these ladies used sex to get what they wanted was funny to me because till this day women still use that strategy. It did make me think about Aristophanes, and how or what he was thinking when he wrote this. The story\u2019s plot line was easy to figure out but the dialogue was a bit off to me, well I guess the way that it was wrote out. I would skip over some lines and would get lost, but that\u2019s something on my end not him. Any who, the fact that the story had the gender vs. gender thing going on is what made me like it. Who doesn\u2019t enjoy a battle of the sexes? So I enjoyed when they would go back and forth with each other bickering about everything. Like in the beginning where the chorus of the women head out to acropolis to pour water on the men\u2019s fire. I am still in between about if I would read it again or not, but overall I enjoyed the read and the jokes, it does make you giggle from time to time."}, {"userName": "R.G.

But what stands out about this Penguin Books edition of Lysistrata is the way in which Lysistrata is brought together with two other, perhaps lesser-known plays from Aristophanes\u2019 canon, all of which are united by the way in which the great Athenian comic dramatist uses comedy to confront the society of his time. Two of these plays -- Lysistrata itself and The Acharnians -- provide trenchant commentary on the Peloponnesian War in which Athens was then engaged against Sparta; the third, The Clouds, is equally successful as a comedy of ideas.The title of The Acharnians (425 B.C.) made me ask, \u201cWho were the Acharnians?\u201d A quick bit of research showed me that Acharnae was a deme or district of Athens whose citizens were renowned for military valor; for a U.S. analogy, imagine an American playwright calling a play The Texans and thus capitalizing on Texans\u2019 reputation for particular fighting spirit within U.S. culture. The Acharnians of The Acharnians are the play\u2019s chorus \u2013 a group of old war veterans, the kind of guys who like to sit around and recount their courage of old, while expecting the younger generation to emulate their example. And these old Acharnians are anything but happy with the play\u2019s protagonist, Dikaiopolis. You see, Dikaiopolis (whose name, to me, sounds more fitting for a city than for a person) sees the absurdity of the Peloponnesian War (The Acharnians was first performed in the war\u2019s sixth year), and wishes to make what amounts to a separate peace. Working with the guidance of the immortal Amphitheus (whose presence in the play seems to indicate that the Olympian gods would smile upon an Athenian decision to turn away from war), Dikaiopolis successfully breaks with the militaristic policies of post-Periclean Athens, and enjoys the fruits of peace thereby. Aristophanes\u2019 approval of Dikaiopolis\u2019 brave and lonely stand is clear by play\u2019s end, when the militaristic general Lamachus, the play\u2019s chief antagonist, is reduced to begging Dikaiopolis to sell him three thrushes and an eel. Dikaiopolis scornfully replies, \u201cHim? I wouldn\u2019t sell him anything if he gave me his shield! Let him shake his crests at the salt-fish vendors!\u201d (p. 51); and the play\u2019s chorus heartily approves, addressing the Athenian audience directly: \u201cCitizens, see the reward of his wisdom,/How peace wins him many a fine business deal\u201d (p. 51). Clearly, Aristophanes was wishing that the citizens and the government of Athens would see the wisdom of Dikaiopolis\u2019 stepping away from war.The Clouds (423 B.C.) is probably most interesting to modern readers because of its depiction of Socrates. In the Platonic dialogues, Socrates is a gentle, diffident figure, bringing his interlocutors to the truth through patient questioning. The Socrates of The Clouds, by contrast, lacks both the humility and the heroism of Plato\u2019s Socrates. In contrast with The Acharnians\u2019 Dikaiopolis, whose anti-war convictions mean that his heart is in the right place, the protagonist of The Clouds, the elderly farmer Strepsiades, is a thoroughgoing scoundrel. Debt-ridden because of the extravagant ways of his son Pheidippides, Strepsiades wants to learn the art of rhetoric because he believes that doing so will help him argue his way out of debt; and Socrates assures Strepsiades that \u201cYou\u2019ll become a really smooth, smarmy talker \u2013 the finest flower in the oratorical garden\u201d (84). The Socrates of The Clouds is marked in large part by his impiety toward the Olympian gods \u2013 when Zeus, the king of the gods, is invoked, Socrates scornfully replies, \u201cZeus? Who\u2019s Zeus? What rubbish you talk! There is no Zeus!\u201d (p. 88) \u2013 and perhaps it is no wonder that in one of Plato\u2019s dialogues, Socrates wonders aloud if Aristophanes\u2019 portrayal of him in The Clouds may have led to the Athenian state\u2019s decision to execute him 24 years later. As for the resolution of The Clouds, suffice it to say that neither Strepsiades nor Pheidippides benefits from this unethical attempt to use rhetoric as a way to avoid paying one\u2019s bills.Lysistrata (411 B.C.) is certainly the best-known of these plays; \u201coh, yeah, that Greek play where the women all go on a sex strike.\u201d The very scenario seems replete with comic possibilities; and yet, as with so many of the greatest comedies, Lysistrata has a deadly serious subtext. By the time Lysistrata was first staged, the Peloponnesian War had been going on for nineteen years. Small wonder, then, that the satirical edge of Lysistrata seems harsher than that of The Acharnians, as the play\u2019s protagonist and title character calls upon all the women of Athens to withhold sex from their husbands, and for the women of Sparta to do likewise, until the husbands of both warring city-states see fit to make peace. \u201cWe\u2019re at home, beautifully made up, and we walk around the house wearing sheer lawn shifts and nothing else\u2026and we keep our distance and refuse to come to them \u2013 then they\u2019ll make peace soon enough, you\u2019ll see\u201d (p. 146). As translator and commentator Allan Sommerstein of the University of Nottingham points out, Athenian men in real life would have had other outlets for the release of their sexual energies; but within the fictive world set up by Aristophanes, Lysistrata\u2019s brave scheme works. Seemingly against all odds, the Athenian and Spartan men do make peace, and Lysistrata gets the last word: \u201cAnd let us for the future all endeavor/Not to repeat our errors, never ever!\u201d (p. 191). Make love, not war. Give peace a chance. With 54 wars of varying intensity currently under way around the world, one wishes that Lysistrata\u2019s vision might somehow come true.In accordance with the tradition of excellence established by the Penguin Classics series, Sommerstein\u2019s introduction footnotes do a great deal of good in setting these plays within the context of their times. For any student of classical culture, or of comedy generally, this collection of Aristophanes\u2019 works is essential. Whether you want the high comedy of ideas or the low comedy of sex talk and bodily functions, Aristophanes is the comedian for you."}, {"userName": "David Bickerton", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75170294-david-bickerton", "userReview": "Disclaimer: I know nothing about Greek theatre with the Iliad being my only previous entry into the Greek classics so I didn't know what to expect from this comedy, but I thought it was hilarious.

Aristophanes is my first comedic Greek play write and likely to be my last because he is the only one that survives. This volume contains Lysistrata, The Archanians and the Clouds. There quality varies although all are good. I would give The Archanians 4 stars, The Clouds 4 1/2 starts but Lysistrata 5 stars because it is by any stretch of the imagination a brilliant piece of art.The short format of Greek plays lends itself better to comedy than to Drama and that means that unlike the Greek dramatist who typical must compress epic tragedy into a brief hour, Aristophanes is working without those kind of time constraints. Aristophanes style is remarkably earthy and ribald. There are lots and lots of jokes about farting, shitting and penises here. There are also a lot of puns that the translator understandably struggles with. The best bits are however satires of individual persons, many of whom remain well known to anyone who knows about the period and general satires of the foibles and stupidity of humans.The works are remarkably daring and political. Ancient Greek plays were usually only preformed once in a particular venue with a huge audience watching. It is remarkable then to consider that these plays would have been performed with many of the satirical targets sitting in the audience. Aristophanes politics are mostly propeace, but otherwise reactionary. The Clouds attacks Socrates and the new philosophy. This is often considered an unfair attack, because Aristophanes ascribes views to Socrates that clearly were held by other philosophers, but it is clear that Socrates stands in for all the philosophers, sophists and rhetoricians of his day. I say this as an entire convert to Socrates cause.Lysistrata is a play that almost defies explanation. It is about women withholding sex so that there husbands will make peace. Written towards the end of the Peloponnesian War it is remarkable in its tolerant attitude to Sparta. If someone where to write a play like this today about a modern conflict, it would feel fresh revolutionary and controversial. In a weird way the closest thing to it today is the more intelligent comedy of Matt Parker and Trey Stone. The way in which, in all the plays, the chorus is used is extraordinary and it is amazing to thing that that device can be used in such a subversive manner.I don't know that it is one of the funniest works ever written, but I find you can never tell with comedies until you watch them performed, but my it is daring and thoughtful and mixes the most and least sophisticated ideas seamlessly. Brilliant writing. No wonder it has lasted almost two and a half thousand years."}, {"userName": "Sophia Park", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/616692-sophia-park", "userReview": "I picked this up at a used book store (in impressive condition) simply out of curiosity: I'd read Plato's Symposium, and loved Aristophanes' speech on love, so how were his actual plays?I guess the short answer is that they don't hold up entirely today. It's incredibly local humour, which makes total sense given the context surrounding these plays - and, after all, he's writing for a particular audience. Plus, so little humour is universal, though he's found some of it: I hope you like sex jokes.The trouble is that the timing of comedy is crucial and our translator was so nice as to both a)make hundreds of footnotes per play and b)put these footnotes in the back of the bookand these footnotes are pretty much mandatory if you want to get why half the stuff is funny, relevant, or even really coherent, as he gets in-your-face political every chance he gets. Between that and the puns (think a father and son, with the son sleeptalking about racing horses, and the father saying something like \"Oh, racing are we? You're racing ME into the ground with all your spending!\" and you get just how bad it is) it's a little irritating.But with the footnotes in the back and the book's reliance on them, you're flipping so often that you don't really get the conversation's humour as you're constantly detached from it. I think this problem is common with such archaic works, but it really could've been helped by more convenient placement: say, on the bottom of the page?I think The Clouds makes up for it, though, as it really is enjoyably dark stuff. There are essentially zero likeable characters; everyone is either a dick or morally reprehensible, and the competition between cultural ideas in the father and son is pretty interesting.I think this collection is great for letting us connect to an incredibly foreign culture: even if plays are reconstructions, not mirrors of life, it's still fun to see how these plays were concocted, how these people spoke (well, in an English analogue, anyway), and what certain traditions entailed, and the footnotes and introductions really do help to place you in the proper mindset to read. Still, it's not as enjoyable as I'd have liked."}, {"userName": "JC", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1948146-jc", "userReview": "This was my first foray into Ancient Greek theater, and I have to say it was thoroughly enjoyable. All three of these plays were funny and fascinating looks into the attitudes, speech, and ways of life in Athens at a particularly potent stage of its history. While many of the contemporary jokes and references won't make sense without flipping to the end of the book to read all the notes, I don't feel that this really detracted too much from the experience (it would have been much better if they were footnotes, though!). And much of the humor does translate perfectly, since sex jokes and skewering hypocrites are pretty universal comedy tropes. Not to mention this little thing called human nature, which hasn't really changed much at all in the last 2400 years.I'm torn between choosing The Clouds and Lysistrata as my favorite of the lot. Despite painting a grossly unfair and terribly inaccurate picture of Socrates, The Clouds is a play about generational culture clashes that is as relevant today as it's ever been. Aristophanes takes aim at both sides of the divide here, and the end result is a stinging and very funny piece of satire. Lysistrata on the other hand is an anti-war, female-empowering sex comedy that is laugh-out-loud funny (and very explicit! The jokes about blue balls and awkward boners make our modern mainstream society seem prude in comparison). All this being said, while I recognize the genius of Aristophanes, I think the translator could have done a better job. Sommerstein has this obsession with Gilbert and Sullivan which, to my sensibilities, comes off as really cheesy during the many songs of the Chorus which he set to tunes from their musicals. His translations of some of the jokes also miss the mark. Many of the original jokes are untranslatable puns, and Sommerstein's substitutions leave a lot to be desired. He probably should have consulted with a comedy writer, because the places where he over-reaches or completely changes the meaning of a line just to make sure they still contain a pun felt really inorganic to me. This is just a minor point though, and on the whole I really enjoyed reading these plays."}, {"userName": "Matthew", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/387514-matthew", "userReview": "I read \"Lysistrata\", but the other two works in this Penguin collection, I'm sorry to say, never engaged me. I'm sure there would be more to pull me in in the original language, but alas, I'm not that interested in comedy plays in English that aren't a great deal more complex. I realize that I don't get more than half of the references in any of the plays, but they are broad farces either way, so not particularly my thing. I will say of Alan H. Sommerstein's translation that it is 100% modern. It reads exactly like a late 20th century play in that there is no rhythm and no subtlety, so that most of the attempts at surprise or irony are pretty well foundered. I participated in a reading of the play in which we each read from different translations, & I think I preferred all of the others to the Sommerstein version, even the old rhyming verse translation that one of our players was using. I don't know Ancient Greek, of course, so I can only speculate, but I imagine that most of the sexual puns & bawdiness which made \"Lysistrata\" a classic were based in innuendos and allusion. Even if that isn't so, I enjoyed the approach taken by other translators in chosing roundabout or nudging ways of telling jokes & was not much of a fan of Sommerstein's flat, matter-of-fact deliveries. I suppose that that's the modern way, going for the shock value of having all the character's speaking as explicitly as possible, but I'm confused as to how any modern adult is really capable of being shocked when that sort of thing proliferates everywhere these days. Better to be teased and titillated than to have the whole kit & caboodle set unceremoniously in front of you, I always say.As to the play \"Lysistrata\", it's original and amusing, if not very deep. I liked it, but I don't have a lot more to say. A couple of readings of it was plenty, and I'm sure I'd enjoy seeing it performed (though preferrably with a different translation & staged without all the notorious foam rubber penis & vagina costumes that are apparently requisite in most modern productions).

I first heard of Aristophanes at some point in high school, while studying something cheerful like Antigone or Medea during VCE. And in comparison, Greek comedy sounded like a hell of a lot of fun, which is why I figured I may as well add some to my Classics Club list, especially after hearing Lysistrata referred to as essentially a feminist story.This collection started with The Achanians, which is essentially arguing for peace during a long war with Sparta. Next came The Clouds, which basically takes the piss out of the Greek philosophers. And finally, I came to Lysistrata, which features the women of the various Greek city states deciding that the quickest way to end a war is to withhold sex.Of the three, I think The Achanians may have been my favourite. All three featured a hell of a lot of dick jokes, but The Achanians also involved a lot of poking fun at the other city states, which was still pretty damned funny thousands of years later. That said, Lysistrata is definitely a rare classic in that it's very female dominated and revolves around women having agency over their bodies, so it was definitely a pretty great read as well.I had a few issues with the translation in this one. Obviously, a lot of the humour wouldn't translate well to modern English - thankfully, Penguin always provide plenty of footnotes on that front! - but Alan H. Sommerstein made the decision to make the Spartans have stereotypical Scottish accents and mannerisms, and the Corinthians have stereotypical Irish accents and mannerisms. Which DID work moderately well - it gave a sense of how the Athenians felt about each of their neighbouring city states. But at the same time, it was totally bizarre to have characters with Scottish accents talking about Zeus and Athena and Poseidon.On the whole, this collection was funnier than I was anticipating - I thought it would be more like Shakespeare's comedies, where they're hilarious in person but on the page, they tend to be pretty dry, so I was pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing out loud while reading it, and I'm definitely glad I put it on my Classics Club list!"}, {"userName": "Jordan LeMasonry", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45553779-jordan-lemasonry", "userReview": "Old Comedy is particularly difficult to get into. Unlike Greek tragedy of the same period - which almost invariably takes a popular myth and adds a newfangled spin - comedy is full to the brim with references, in-jokes and witticisms that are impossible to translate into English. Nonetheless, Alan Sommerstein does a fantastic job of modernising three of Aristophanes' most successful plays, at least in modern eyes.The Acharnians is a lighthearted tale focusing on one man's selfish ideals for peace during a war torn era. Dikaiopolis is both hilarious and foolishly naive as he goes about abusing the peace he alone has acquired, and Aristophanes pokes fun at Euripides and Lammachus, though not in equal measure. The Acharnians is definitely the funniest of the three plays listed here, at least to modern readers.The Clouds - Aristophanes' worst play at the time - is darker and more targeted on Socrates, perhaps unfairly so. Its protagonist, Strepsiades, is as foolish as Dikaiopolis, but not amusingly so. Clouds' witticisms are more difficult to find and it feels distinctly unfinished (which it is!). Finally, Lysistrata returns to a funnier topic - women withholding sex to end the same war which has been going on since The Acharnians. Albeit not focused heavily on Lysistrata herself, the play demonstrates the same ideals Aristophanes outlined in The Acharnians, namely that the enemy - Sparta - might not be as bad as they seem. All in all, these three plays readily demonstrate Aristophanes' ability and innate talent, though Frogs, Knights of Wasps might have been a better choice instead of Clouds. Worth a look at if Old Comedy is your thing, though prepare to flick to the endnotes over and over again!"}, {"userName": "Regan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37152492-regan", "userReview": "The first time I studied Lysistrata I was a sophomore in high school and it was part of a Humanities course. I remember watching another Greek play done \"traditionally\" and literally having to remember to close my mouth, I was staring slack-jawed in amazement at the screen and thinking it was one of the most bizarre, intense pieces of theater I'd ever witnessed, the play we were actually reading was kind of lost to that visual experience. Probably the last time I read it was my freshman year in college, another Humanities course, and - both in high school and college - I remember thinking the play was engaging and thought-provoking but not being over-the-moon or otherwise strongly reactive to the piece.So I am teaching a Lit course next semester and I knew I wanted a loose gender theme to the class and I wanted at least one Greek play - Lysistrata was the easy choice. I just re-read it and HOLY SHIT! Have we become such a prudish society in the past 25 years that something that didn't even cause me to bat an eye then is making me blush now?! Have I?! I remembered that the men wear enormous phallus pieces and, of course, I remembered that the entire show is about sex and power but somehow I missed the part where every single line is a very blatant sexual innuendo. I feel like discussion of this piece has the potential to be amazing but I'd better brace myself now for the kick back of the offended. Woah. Apparently I need to re-read some of those Greek plays I haven't looked at for a few decades."}, {"userName": "Derek", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6324084-derek", "userReview": "Oh so many dick jokes. So, so many dick jokes. The first play, \"Acharnians,\" is a fairly forgettable hodgepodge, but this volume shines with \"Clouds\" and \"Lysistrata\" (the latter being my favorite of the whole lot). This is my first stint reading Aristophanes, and I am not at all disappointed. Due to the enormous number of notations, I would highly suggest the reader ignore these for the initial read-through, unless really spurred to understand a joke or reference (of which there are an absurd amount). I attempted to read every note with the first play and it bogged my reading down tremendously, to the point it likely affected my appreciation of the play.I'm not sure if I'm a fan of Sommerstein's translation; I expected much more obscene language, but it's been fairly toned down here (there are still a few 'fucks' to be given, though!). I am also torn as to whether or not I really care for his use of accents to distinguish different regions of the Old World (I guess it's just hard for me to think of the Spartans as sounding Scottish, but, hey, to each his or her own). These trivialities aside, I really enjoyed Aristophanes and look forward to finishing his extant works."}, {"userName": "Holly Lindquist", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2650600-holly-lindquist", "userReview": "This book contains 3 plays: The Acharnians, a play dealing with the conflict between Athens and Sparta and the need for resolution;Clouds, a black comedy that mercilessly skewers Socrates and his school of philosophy; & Lysistrata, the raunchy classic in which the women of Greece refuse to grant any sexual favors until their men end the Peloponnesian War.Anyone trying to translate the plays of Aristophanes has his work cut out for him. Puns are hard to convey from one language to another, and these plays are chock-full of them. Not to mention a host of inside jokes regarding politicians, other playwrights, and notable figures. Not to mention a Greek truckload of phallological and scatological humor (Seriously, the Farrelly brothers have nothing on Aristophanes).Despite these difficulties, Alan Somerstein does an admirable job with his translation and the notes are extremely helpful in clarifying some of the more obscure jokes. The only thing I really had trouble with is when the Spartans & Megarians take on Scottish accents. It just did not work for me."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16319528-rachel", "userReview": "This is the first set of Attic comedy that I've read, though we looked at passages of Lysistrata in high school. I loved this so much more than I thought I would. The Acharnians was funny, and Lysistrata was interesting and amusing from a gender point of view (women all over Greece pledge to deprive their men of sex until the men agree to make peace and end the war), but The Clouds was what won it for me. The writing was just so funny, and the characters so ridiculous, I was laughing out loud every few lines. While I'm sure that much of the original wit and play-on-words style is lost in an English translation, I was amazed at how relevant and hilarious the play still is today, and the way they made fun of the supposed intellectuals of the day seemed all too familiar. I really really enjoyed reading this play and felt very disappointed a) when it ended, and b) knowing I would never get to sit with the original audience and see it performed at the Dionysia!P.S. Sorry Socrates for this play leading to your trial/death. It was funny anyhow, you have to admit."}], "description": "Writing at the time of political and social crisis in Athens Aristophanes was an eloquent yet bawdy challenger to the demagogue and the sophist. The Achanians is a plea for peace set against the background of the long war with Sparta. In Lysistrata a band of women tap into the awesome power of sex in order to end a war. The darker comedy of The Clouds satirizes Athenian philosophers, Socrates in particular, and reflects the uncertainties of a generation in which all traditional religious and ethical beliefs were being challenged.For this edition Alan Sommerstein has completely revised his translation of these three plays, bringing out the full nuances of Aristophanes\u2019 ribald humour and intricate word play, with a new introduction explaining the historical and cultural background to the plays.", "title": "Lysistrata and Other Plays", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1567.Lysistrata_and_Other_Plays", "average": 3.95, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1373153891l/1567.jpg", "reviews": 110, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1011.Aristophanes", "name": "Aristophanes"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/355492.Alan_H_Sommerstein", "name": "Alan H.
