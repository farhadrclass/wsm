The Great Wheel was one of the books on the list that I had apparently been deprived of as a boy, so I decided to correct the situation. This was a great find. Although it is written for younger readers, the story was uplifting and fun to read. The life of a young Irish immigrant is changed in many ways when he is employed by Mr. George Washington Gale Ferris in the construction of the first Ferris Wheel for the 1893 World's Columbian Expostion in Chicago.I was surprised to find insights which would probably only be fully appreciated by more mature readers. One of the characters is a Scottish ship rigging master who was severely injured in a fall. Although still able to perform his work exceptionally well, the fall left his body bent and crooked, which forces him to walk sideways; \"crab-like\". He shares his despair that any woman would ever consider such a man as a husband.As a retired engineer, I was also surprised to find at a very insightful statement of my own feelings. Mr. Ferris says, \"...you see we engineers, supposedly so hard-boiled and practical, are great dealers in dreams and visions. As much so as poets and artists. for everything we build is first only a dream-then we make the dream come true. Instead of brush or pen we do it with steel and concrete, with slide-rule, bolts and rivets-but first was the dream.\" And finally, as the story comes to a conclusion, it is apparent the main theme is one of faith. Faith to accomplish that which is based on true principles, but has not been seen before. It was summed up in a tune the workers sang as they walked home in the twilight after work:Ezekiel saw the wheelWay in the middle of the air.And the little wheel ran by faithAnd the big wheel ran by the grace of God.It's a wheel in a wheelWay in the middle of the air."}, {"userName": "Story Revolution", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2303240-story-revolution", "userReview": "Your fortune lies to the west.

Instead, it tells the story of one of the men who helped build the Great Ferris Wheel!The Story.Cornelius Terence Kilroy has never dreamed of going west \u2013 but the west is calling his name! His Uncle Michael has offered for Conn to cross the Atlantic Sea, leaving his home in Ireland to live and work in New York City.Conn agrees and the next day begins his journey to New York City. He enjoys his life there \u2013 living with a doting aunt and friendly cousins is pleasant and makes him feel at home. But one day, Conn\u2019s Uncle Patrick comes to stay with his brother. A passionate man with flaming red hair, he loudly and proudly describes the work of his friend, George Washington Gale Ferris \u2013 the marvelous Ferris Wheel that is being built for the 1893 Chicago World Fair. Conn is strangely stirred by Uncle Patrick\u2019s description. He decides to accompany him to Illinois.The work is hard, but fulfilling. Each day substantial progress is made with the building. But will the Great Wheel be built in time for the fair? And will it actually work?Cautions.The most troubling aspect of the story has concerns a prophecy which Conn\u2019s Aunt Honora made. Here is the passage.When Conn was twelve years old, Aunt Honora read his fortune from the leaves in his cup. She was very old, even then, and the village considered her a Wise Woman.\u201cNeil, lad,\u201d she said, peering into the cup, \u201cmind well what I\u2019m telling you now. Your fortune lies to the west. Keep your face to the sunset and follow the evening star, and one day you\u2019ll ride the greatest wheel in all the world.\u201d [pgs. 1-2]This prophecy is referenced around a dozen times in the one hundred eighty page book (which isn\u2019t too bad) and was used mainly as a plot device to make the story seem more Irish. Aunt Honora\u2019s methods of fortune telling \u2013 reading a person\u2019s fortune in tea leaves! \u2013 is not detailed. The troubling thing is that the prophecy came true. A broken clock is right twice a day?Conn develops an affection for a young Dutch girl named Trudy while at sea. Because she does not know what her address will be when she gets to America, he is unable to obtain it. During the course of the book he thinks about her and sometimes writes letters to her which he cannot mail. At the end of the story, *SPOILER* she attends the fair where the meet up and agree to marry one another.Far from being a problem, I thought Conn\u2019s relationship with Trudy to be a sweet addition to the story \u2013 none of their interaction or conversations are inappropriate. I thought that (apart from not knowing each other very well) they had a solid foundation for their relationship; they were both level-headed and spoke practically about what their future would be like.When Uncle Patrick sends some money to Conn\u2019s mother, he specifies its use, adding that whatever money is left can be used to buy masses for her dead husband. Other than one reference to the Saints, this is all the religion in this story.Uncle Patrick declares that Mr. Ferris \u201chas as great a knowledge of the ways of iron and steel as the god Vulcan himself.\u201d [pg. 33]Conn\u2019s cousin, Agnes, writes a letter to him, saying,\u201cNow I will tell you a great secret but you must not breathe a word of it to anyone. Mamma and Stella and I are going to begin to work on Papa to take us to the Fair this summer, instead of that tiresome old Brighton Beach. Won\u2019t that be exciting? Lots of our friends are planning to go but Papa says it is a waste of money. He says that there will not be much to see that is worth while and he wouldn\u2019t ride on the Ferris Wheel if you paid him. He says that he can\u2019t see why this great Fair us being made to honor Columbus who was only an Italian sailor anyway. If it was for Robert Emmet or George Washington there\u2019d be some sense to it he says.But we will bring him around, never fear, and by the time our trunks are packed he will think it was all his idea.\u201d [pg. 78-79]Conn later imagines what it will be like for Agnes to be \u201cworking\u201d on her father. He chuckles at the idea but considers her to be a bossy girl.\u2018By gorry\u2019 is used twice; \u2018wish to God\u2019 and \u2018holy saints\u2019 are each used once.Conclusion. Definitely worthwhile, The Great Wheel approaches the story of the Chicago World Fair from a perspective rarely mentioned \u2013 the worker\u2019s.Visit The Blithering Bookster to read more reviews!www.blitheringbookster.com"}, {"userName": "Becky B", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12785148-becky-b", "userReview": "Our story starts with Conn, a young man in Ireland, who is told by his aunt that he will journey west following the evening star and ride a great wheel. Conn soon does find himself going west, called to join his Uncle Michael in a successful sewer and drain business in New York City. Conn quickly learns the trade and is a great help to his uncle who starts talking about making him a partner, but Conn isn\u2019t sure he wants to make drains all his life. He keeps thinking of his aunt\u2019s fortune for him and the German immigrant Trudy headed to Wisconsin he met on the boat over. When his Uncle Patrick shows up looking for workers for Mr. Ferris\u2019 new engineering project for the Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Conn jumps at the chance. He is soon working on what others are calling Ferris\u2019s Folly, a great wheel that people will ride at the fair. Many say it won\u2019t work and will fall to ruin, but Uncle Patrick has great faith in Mr. Ferris\u2019 designs and drives all the workers hard to make sure it is a success. Conn learns new skills as he helps put the giant wheel together. When the wheel is finally finished, it does work and visitors come in droves. Conn wonders if Trudy will show up at the fair because he can\u2019t get her out of his mind.This reads a bit like a mixture between a 1940s romantic comedy musical and a documentary on the technical details of building the first Ferris wheel. The first part comes from the fortune told Conn by his aunt and the following series of coincidences that happily get Conn to the right place and impossibly reunited for a happily ever after with Trudy (though the reader is always pretty sure that will happen\u2026even though he doesn\u2019t know her last name, only that her uncle is a dairy farmer and his first name is Otto). I\u2019m guessing the sticker on the front is largely due to the popularity of such romanitic comedy musicals and the nostalgia of the older generation in the 1950s who could have witnessed this first wheel's unveiling. I like the old musicals, but in book form it came across as a bit too ridiculously serendipitous. Really, we should view Conn as in love with a fantasy and needing to get snapped out of his delusions. He\u2019s planning his whole future on hopes of a chance encounter! The second feel comes from the numerous chapters dedicated to describing Conn and Uncle Patrick\u2019s work on the wheel and exactly what they were doing at each step. This part I found hard to follow, not being up on mid 1800s engineering terms. Either study up on steel working methods prior to reading this or be ready to skim. There are some pictures, but not enough. I\u2019m sure most modern young readers are going to ditch the book after getting lost in this quagmire. Though, I must add after reading Larson\u2019s The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair that Changed AmericaDevil in the White City it seems a fairly accurate historical description of the building process, so Lawson appears to have done his own research. It\u2019s just not riveting fiction material. Another thing likely to turn off many modern readers are the antiquated terms (primarily \"negro\") used of African Americans, which, though it may have been used by those of the time period in which the book is set, come off offensive today. One last challenge for modern readers will be the vocabulary and vernacular used, from 1800s Irish slang to deep Southern drawls. It is a great exercise in puzzling through heavy vernacular, which can be fun, but can also completely lose readers. Overall, I\u2019m not even sure if this would get published today. There are merits to the fictional recounting of the building of the first Ferris wheel, but I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s going to be mostly adults today interested in the time period or trying to read all Newbery Honor books who are willing to slog through the entire book. I don\u2019t see many modern middle graders enjoying this one.Notes on content: No swearing. Some racial language not ok today. No sexual content. The construction requires some dangerous situations, but no one is hurt."}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4063913-beth", "userReview": "The Great Wheel is the story of Conn, who helps build the world's first Ferris Wheel. It's also the story of his family, friends, and fellow immigrants, and each character is distinctive, colorful, and lovingly drawn. Take his Uncle Patrick, who assures Mr. Ferris that for every 1/16 of an inch wrong in the measurements, that amount should be sliced off his nose. Or Martin Brennan, master rigger, who jumps aboard the derrick raising the largest piece of steel ever forged - the size of which was never raised before. Or Mr. Zillheimer, the pork magnate, and his family, and his lawyer Mr. Peabody. Or Mr. Ferris himself:He did not appear especially unusual or impressive: of medium size, well but quietly dressed and rather young - in his thirties, Conn guessed, although a heavy mustache made him look somewhat older. The only striking things about him were his keen, piercing, deepset eyes and his air of quiet but absolute confidence. \"If he was to be telling you the world was square you'd be believing him - and he'd be right, likely,\" Conn thought.It's amazing how this book of steel and rivets and terrifically hard work is really a book of hope and ambition and starry-eyed dreaming. Mr. Ferris puts it best:\"It may surprise you, Conn, but you see we engineers, supposedly so hard-boiled and practical, are great dealers in dreams and visions. As much so as poets and artists. For everything we build is first only a dream - then we make the dream come true. Instead of brush or pen we do it with steel and concrete, with slide-rule and tape and transit, bolts and rivets - but first was the dream.\"Out there right now there is just a messy field of frozen mud and some slabs of concrete. But there is also a vision. Close your eyes and think hard and you can see it - the great wheel turning slowly, majestically, soundlessly. Lifting people up for a little while into the clean upper air, out of the dust and noise of their everyday existence. Giving them a glimpse of wider horizons than they have ever known - perhaps a closer sight of the evening star. I wonder if Ferris's Folly is as foolish as it seems, to some?\"Needless to say, it was a tremendous success - and along with that greater engineering success comes a no-less-satisfying personal success, a lovely resolution to Conn's story. The Great Wheel is a beautiful, funny, moving story of many of the forgotten people who populate our history. (Including the singers. Not many writers incorporate other works well.

There was a lot of engineering stuff, which would probably appeal to a small and specific group of kids, and a little romance, which would appeal to another group of...okay, I'll say it, girls, except that that particular set of girls wouldn't have much interest in the main part of the story, and the romance probably wouldn't interest the kids in it for the engineering.
