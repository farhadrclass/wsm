I eagerly look forward to the new book in the series each year and devour it I eagerly look forward to the new book in this series each year and devour it when it hits my library. Like Tom Sawyer, who felt good from Sunday school almost until Tuesday, I have to live with inhuman urges again soon.In this one, a landowner gets pushed too far by the Environmental Protection Ageny and is believed to be guilty of killing two staff serving him papers. Pickett, who knows him as the father of his daughter\u2019s best friend, wangles it so he is on the team trying to find him in a remote wilderness in the Bighorn Mountains, thus giving him a chance to protect him from getting blown away by the trigger-happy forces marshaled against him. Problems escalate from the mistakes of putting a bounty on the man, sending unprepared people after him, and inappropriate use of drones. Soon there is a hostage situation. Joe doesn\u2019t have the help of his ex-Special Forces friend Nate in this tale. But his business-savvy wife, Marybeth, lends a hand with research to get to the bottom of why a particular EPA administrator was so gung-ho in this case in the first place.I enjoy rooting for Pickett in his Dudley Do-Right roles which have him courageously outfoxing the forces of corruption or greed that lie behind conflicts over the environment or resource management in the mountain West. He is not a total Boy Scout, as he\u2019s not above bending the law on small things to bag big game of the rogue human type. His righteous anger, once engaged, is always getting him in hot water with the powers that be, often at the cost of putting his job on the line or his family at risk. I like how his typical day calls for work on horseback and appreciate his laconic humor, his devotion for his wife and three daughters, and his stubborn persistence for justice. The theme in this one is on abuses of power by the Environmental Protection Agency does not indict the whole organization, but the deficiencies in the system that allow Compliance Orders of cease-and-desist, remediation, and huge fines with no legal recourse of judicial review by the accused offender. Such a right of judicial review was restored by a Supreme Court ruling in 2012 in the case of Sackett v. EPA, a case from Idaho which Box models his tale on to some extent. Likely other interventions by federal agencies will be affected by the precedent of this ruling (article on case).It seems several of my Goodreads friends tried the first or second in the Joe Pickett series, rendered 3 star reviews, and didn\u2019t try any more. As one who has read 11 of 13 volumes, I think Box\u2019s skills improved over time. I encourage everyone to try him at his peak\u2014the order of reading them matters little."}, {"userName": "Dana Stabenow", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1608124-dana-stabenow", "userReview": "No one born and raised west of the Mississippi River hasn't had a justifiable mad on at the federal government a time or two.

Run an armed drone around the rim of the glass and toss it off in a national forest mostly dead of beetle kill and you've got a conflagration even Wyoming Game and Fish warden Joe Pickett can't put out, and may not survive himself.I've got a problem with the ending but, thinking it over, maybe we haven't heard the last of...never mind.[And before you think the plot is over the top, read this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sackett_...

I've often said that a good book for me, is one with a great story line, or one with great writing, Box's books are always the best of both! Each successive Joe Picket, Wyoming Fish and Game Warden, novel just gets better and better. Characterization, descriptions, conflicts between good and evil, and the pull between legal justice and moral justice are enhanced by stories that connect to headlines of the day. Box mixes each mystery, with a continuing family story, and a fictional accounting of non-fiction reality. When one of Joe's friends is accused of murder, Joe becomes involved in ways that he'd never imagined. Lyle, and his wife, have finally gotten a piece of land on which to build their own home. Permits in hand, Lyle begins grading the land when EPA employees come and demand that he return the land to exactly as he's found it previously. The fine for not doing so will be $70,000 a day. And why is this happening? Lyle is told it's because his land has been declared 'protected wetlands'. With no water at all on his land, he questions this declaration. But no one at the EPA has any paperwork , nor are they answering his repeated phone calls. So this story begins, and ends in disaster when two EPA agents are murdered, and an all out man hunt is begun by the EPA to \"kill the murderer.\"This case is based on a real case in North Dakota, that bends credulity. There are other actions , also based on \"truth\" that just may blow your mind. Joe is caught up in the manhunt, as determined by the Governor, but the more and more that things progress, Joe begins to realize that there is something more that just doesn't make sense. An edge of your seat story keeps the suspense until the very last page!! I think I love you C J Box!!!! Never stop telling stories in books!!"}, {"userName": "LJ", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/250195-lj", "userReview": "First Sentence: On an early morning in mid-August, EPA Special Agents Tim Singewald and Lenox Baker left the Region 8 Environmental Protection Agency building at 1595 Wynkoop Street in downtown Denver in a Chevrolet Malibu SA hybrid sedan they\u2019d checked out from the motor pool.When Joe finds a cut fence and his neighbor, Butch, on Wilderness land, he doesn\u2019t think too much about it. However, when the EPA and Feds come in and insist on taking over an investigation of two murdered EPA agents found on the neighbor\u2019s land, Joe seriously questions their motives and methods. In order to keep things as controlled as possible, he agrees to lead the agents into the mountains to track Butch down. Boy, can this man write!! The story is completely engrossing; all the more so as the premise is taken from a true story. If anything, I can\u2019t quite understand why he is not as popular and widely read as other, similar authors. It\u2019s certainly not for lack of storytelling. Perhaps it is because he calls out the wrong-doing of some who work for public agencies and misuse their positions. I appreciate it, as it is one way to keep such agencies in check.Box\u2019s characters rank among the best. Joe is a man of strong morality and integrity, but knows there are times when justice must prevail over the letter of the law. He\u2019s also not perfect, which makes him even better. His marriage has gone through rough patches, but they\u2019re stronger for it. His daughters are growing up and are written very realistically for their ages. I like that Nate, a favorite character of the series\u2019 fans, makes an appearance, albeit a small one. For those who\u2019ve not yet read the series, there is enough information to jump in and not feel lost. However, do yourselves a favor\u2014start at the beginning and catch up. It\u2019s well worth the reading.There is incredible sense of place. The tension and suspense are palpable. His ability to convey emotion is tangible. You feel Joe\u2019s anger, fear, jubilation and sorrow. The sign of a really good book is when you had intended to turn the light out and 10 p.m., but find yourself still reading until 2 a.m. in order to finish, and the ending leaves you a bit stunned. \u201cBreaking Point\u201d is that good.BREAKING POINT (Lic Invest-Joe Pickett-Wyoming-Contemp)-ExBox, C.J. \u2013 13th in seriesPutnam, 2013"}, {"userName": "Byron Lord", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27780323-byron-lord", "userReview": "I won this book on Good Reads and this is my honest review.C.

An author who consistently wrote books that I enjoyed. And I am kind of a picky, pain-in-the-ass type who isn't all that easy to please. Looking through my list of books to read, I came upon Breaking Point by C. J. Box. I have no idea why I read my first C. J. Box book. I'm not a hunter or fisherman or camper or outdoors-man but, nonetheless, perhaps because I was looking for an author with as few letters in his name as possible, I read one of his books about Joe Pickett, Game Warden in the state of Wyoming. I've been to Wyoming and it is truly a beautiful place and the scenes that Box paints with his words call those images to mind. Joe Pickett makes very little money as a game warden but he is a really decent man with strong principles, a great family as well as a good horse and dog. His strong determination to enforce game laws and regulations really pisses off some people but some people need to be pissed off or pissed on, for that matter. Joe is a decent, hard working, tough, stubborn, highly principled kinda guy.The plot, the characters, the pacing and the quality of writing are all first class in Breaking Point. Although it is one of a continuing series, it is not critical that you read it only after the 12 earlier books but, why not start at the beginning. The book is a really good read and perfect if your last book disappointed you."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2222340-chris", "userReview": "Couldn't put it down. Lots of contemporary themes straight from the news are included. Joe Pickett goes up and down in his career and literally as well while on a mountain as he deals with overzealous Feds and yet another new boss. Joe ends up guiding a SWAT team of EPA guys into the mountains pursuing a local man who killed two of their agents and had been hounded by them. It's almost comical as these commandoes have never ridden a horse. We meet some guys from Joe's past too; to include the governor. There's great resolution and a sense of justice as well as some shocking revelations towards the end of the story. You would think this character would be played out after so many stories but Joe's life is about to take yet another detour or chapter.

When good-guy Butch Roberson seemingly commits two murders Joe investigates and finds that Roberson likely reached his--you guessed it--breaking point. But wait, maybe there is more to it. To find the answers Joe needs to find Roberson before federal agents bent on avenging the deaths of the two fallen EPA workers do. His search takes him back to the site of one of his earlier adventures, Savage Run.

I highly rate this entry because it's part of a great series and is engrossing in its own right, but being highly readable and very exciting does not mean it is without fault. A local contractor has his vacation property condemned by the EPA with supposed repairs exceeding the value of the property and with no prior paperwork or notice, penalties accrue on a daily basis until they amount to he millions of dollars. That scenario is based on the true story of Nordman, Idaho's Sackett family. The regional head of the EPA goes after contractor Roberson with armed agents, a SWAT team and Hellfire armed predator drones, brushing aside Wyoming's governor and head of the Game and Fish Agency. Pickett tries to uncover the underlying motive and eventually finds several, essentially being the petty motives of bureaucrats with insufficiently restrained power.There were two twists at the conclusion of the book. One job related for which I won't provide a spoiler; and the other relating to Roberson's additional motivation (that one I find unsatisfactory and think if it was developed, it would fall apart). Still the book, especially if you're a series fan, is a hot read.Joe Pickett series - It was always good to see Butch Roberson, Joe thought--a hardworking, upright local business owner whose daughter was friends with his own. Little did he know that when he talked to Butch that day in the forest, the man was about to disappear. He was heading into the mountains to scout elk, he said, but instead he was running. Two EPA employees had just been murdered, and all signs pointed to him as the killer. As the manhunt organized itself, Joe heard more of the story--about the tract of land Butch and his wife had bought to build their retirement home on, until the EPA declared it a wetland. About the penalties they charged him when he balked, new ones piling up every day, until the family was torn apart and finally, it seems, the man just cracked. It was an awful story. But was it the whole story? The more Joe looks into it, the more he begins to wonder--and the more he finds himself in the middle of a war he never expected and never wanted. Powerful forces want Roberson not just caught but dead--and the same goes for anyone who stands in their way. Every man reaches his breaking point. Joe Pickett may just have reached his."}, {"userName": "Virginia Campbell", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2333268-virginia-campbell", "userReview": "Once I started reading \"Breaking Point\" from author C.J. Box, I kept reading until I turned the final page. The flow of the writing, the vivid descriptions of the setting, and of course, the terrific lead character, Joe Pickett, kept me entangled in the suspenseful story line until the very end. A longtime Wyoming game warden, Pickett is a man who loves his family, loves the land, and has a job which finds him looking at both sides of how the government rules the country. Nearing fifty, with aches and pains and personal issues which include finding the funds to put three teenagers through college, Pickett is a western everyman. Riding the perimeters of his assigned district on his horse, Toby, with his dog, Daisy, tagging along, was the part of the job he loved the most. On one such ride, he comes across Butch Roberson, the father of Pickett's youngest daughter's best friend. Something about Butch and his claim that he is scouting elk doesn't seem right, but there is nothing that Pickett can pinpoint, so he and Butch go their separate ways. Just a short while later, Pickett learns that Butch is wanted for questioning in the disappearance of two EPA agents who had traveled to the area to speak with Butch. When the murdered agents are found buried on Butch's property, the manhunt escalates out of all proportion and involves high-level government officials acting out their own agenda. Pickett and his family are caught in the middle, and the line between right and wrong gets all wavy. C.J. Box has a distinctive storytelling voice, involving and compelling, yet with a welcome touch of wry humor. Joe Pickett's life will never be the same after \"The Breaking Point\". A suspenseful and surprising thriller you won't want to miss. The story is based on the real-life experiences of a family in Idaho who found themselves in a similar harrowing battle with authority.

Joe Pickett becomes involved with a manhunt run by the EPA. It seems that two of their agents were shot while attempting to deliver a compliance order. Joe knows the suspect and thinks that the case is more complicated than meets the eye. Especially when the EPA starts things off by putting a bounty on the head of Butch Roberson, the suspect. Apparently this case is based loosely upon an actual case that went to the Supreme Court. If it weren't for that fact, the case would seem an over-the-top fiction (to me), with self-serving bureaucrats wreaking havoc with regulations and lack of accountability. Usually in Box's books, there's a bit more of a balance and some shades of gray on both sides. In this one, the government is clearly the enemy. The strength of the book, as always, is in the description of the land and the people of rural Wyoming. It's a pretty harsh place, but there's also a lot of beauty there. People can be both good and bad, but there's something romantic about the types of folks who have learned to be self-sufficient responsible stewards of the land. The case was well-done. You feel for Joe's helplessness in the face of political intrigue, and his determination to at least be a witness so that someone knows what's truly happening. There's a lot of action, too. Part of the end stretched believability for me (I'm not sure how possible it is to ride through waterfalls and rapids clutching a log) but who knows? I only really noticed that part because I'd totally fallen for the rest of the story and was immersed in its world. Nate Romanowski does make a brief appearance. I'm not sure he was necessary in this book, but maybe the stage is being set for something in the future. The political statement of this book made me a bit uncomfortable, although I'm not sure I can argue with it.

In my opinion, no one in this book wears an absolutely white hat; but eveyones hat is tinged with black. There is the person who committed the crime initially, there is the Federal Government (EPA) who really, does get punished; and then there is the state (Joe Pickett) who despite saying that the Federal Government is so bad, shows that the state is not that \"good\" or \"clean\" either. Joe Pickett (the state) would punish someone who for the fun of it hangs antlers in their living room, but someone in this book who actually did do the crime gets off, and the wrong person goes punished. If C.J. Box meant to show that the Federal Government is always acting wrong, always acting bad, it would help his argument if he had a character and showed the state and local government as being above reproach, the paradigm of virtue and goodness.

I was enthralled and disgusted by this story at the same time; yet it was very well written."}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1883261-nancy", "userReview": "When everyone is for himself and no one is for the criminal there is Joe Pickett - mainstay of justice even if he doesn't like it much. Someone has killed two EPA agents in Joe's Territory and a reward has been set for the killer. The EPA head honcho for Wyoming is a total ass, which is typical of a government man but he takes it to a whole new level. Why?Between dodging bullets, leading riders into the forest and ducking drones with Hellfire missles (yep, that's what I said Joe has reached his breaking point and everyone needs to be careful."}, {"userName": "Carol ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4922428-carol", "userReview": "Another good story in the Joe Pickett series. I like Joe Pickett the underpaid Game Warden living his dream in Wyoming. This story made me angry. It is about bureaucrat's with too much power and not enough brains to do the job correctly and sadly mirrors real life today. In this story a family has reached the breaking point do to the EPA.....this was a very good story with a twist I did not see coming...."}, {"userName": "Monica", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2871854-monica", "userReview": "I am actually so glad to have only just discovered C.J. Box in the past couple of months! I don't know how I would have been able to patiently await his next book! Aware that I'm not reading them in order - just what/when I can get them at the Library, but that does not interrupt the story I care about these characters, the writing allows me to \"see\" it before me, and the plus? It is the means by which I can revisit a part of this country (and all that it offers)!"}, {"userName": "Maynard", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9372293-maynard", "userReview": "This work is based on a real event. Reading it reminds us how absolute government power corrupts those with the most power absolutely, trapping, hurting and sometimes breaking good, hard-working people. This time the guilt lies with the EPA and one of its directors. Joe Pickett and all those with the courage of his convictions are my heroes and always have been."}], "description": "It was always good to see Butch Roberson, Joe thought\u2014a hard-working, upright local business owner whose daughter was friends with his own. Little did he know that when he talked to Butch that day, the man was about to disappear. He was heading into the mountains to hunt, he said, but instead he was running. Two EPA employees had just been murdered, and all signs pointed to him as the killer. As the manhunt organized itself, Joe heard more of the story\u2014about the tract of land Butch and his wife had bought to build their retirement home on, until the EPA declared it a wetland. About the penalties they charged him when he balked, new ones piling up every day, until the family was torn apart by debt . . . and finally, it seems, the man just cracked. It was an awful story. But was it the whole story? The more Joe looks into it, the more he begins to wonder\u2014and the more he finds himself in the middle of a war he never expected and never wanted. Powerful forces want Butch not just caught, but dead . . . and the same goes for anyone who stands in their way.", "title": "Breaking Point\n      \n          (Joe Pickett #13)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15815348-breaking-point", "average": 4.27, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1346076596l/15815348.jpg", "reviews": 591, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/314195.C_J_Box", "name": "C.J.
