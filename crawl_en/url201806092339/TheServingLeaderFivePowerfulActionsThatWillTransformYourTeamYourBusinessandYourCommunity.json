I appreciate the values associated with being a serving leader in the workplace, community, and team and wanted to learn more about how to apply these within my professional life. I do not appreciate that these values seem to be tied to particular religious beliefs. The book become less about how to be an exceptional leader to workplace teams (what I was looking for) and more about father-son relationships (death bed regrets), personal confessions (apologies for a marriage that failed 10 years prior) and Christian themes. It was ultimately a (not very well done) spiritual allegory more than a workplace leadership book."}, {"userName": "Jane", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7427536-jane", "userReview": "Have you ever read a book that so overwhelmingly captured your heart you didn\u2019t want it to end? That\u2019s how I felt when I came to the end of The Serving Leader. Written in the style of a novel, this book teaches like a textbook that\u2019s so interesting you can\u2019t put it down. Each chapter adds precept upon precept, like building blocks which perfectly define and illustrate the Serving Leader. Condensing the indispensable content of The Serving Leader is a challenge. The Serving Leader is more than theory. It\u2019s action. Each chapter title, in fact, starts with the directive, Action. This is because \u201cServing Leaders are in the trenches with their teams, businesses, and neighborhoods doing what others are just writing about.\u201d Action: Upend the Pyramid You qualify to be first by putting other people first.You\u2019re in charge principally to charge up others. Action: Raise the BarTo serve the many, you first serve the few.The best reach-down is a challenging reach-up. Action: Blaze the Trail To protect your value, you must give it all away. Your biggest obstacle is the one that hinders someone else.Action: Build on Strength To address your weaknesses, focus on your strengths.You can\u2019t become the best unless others do too. Action: Run to Create PurposeWe all need to be assured of our purpose. If we are going to give our life to something, we want to know it has meaning and that our actions will make a difference. It\u2019s how we are wired. Read a full book summary here. http://bizcatalyst360.com/the-serving...

This book doesn't cover new ground, and is badly written. I love the idea of servant leadership, and find the theories sound, but it was difficult reading this book. The author uses exclamation points constantly - at least once per page, if not once or twice per paragraph at times. I also don't think the authors understand what a \"paradox\" actually is - few of the things labelled as paradoxes are actually paradoxes. The characters were too perfect. I also didn't like the vagueness... on page 74, the main character spends an hour getting an explanation of the process, but none of that explanation is shared. I have no idea what was in that workbook.I was hoping for a more serious analysis of servant leadership theory, not something that read like the Celestine Prophecy."}, {"userName": "Ramon", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1929343-ramon", "userReview": "I am not ashamed to say that this book made me cry. I can't really explain why? I can't even say that I am comfortable with that truth. But, I cried. This book is unlike other books in its genre. Sure, the quick read, the simple story, the promise of failure leading to success were all typical elements of the leadership novel. But this book is different. In it, our hero learns some great concepts and principles and applies them. But, what I really liked was that for once, I could associate with the character. He was, for all intents and purposes, real. I liked that and I could relate to his inner turmoil. That our failures are really masks we wear to hide from what truly ails us, our failures at loving the people we care about the most. I also like that love wasn't the main driver behind it all."}, {"userName": "Eric", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1192042-eric", "userReview": "Book received from Goodreads giveaway. This book is a great resource for all those striving to improve leadership skills. The authors outline five principles for becoming a serving leader. The principles are taught through the telling of a simple story. I didn't really care for the story but it helps illustrate the point. I think the most valuable part of the book is the chapter that was added for this new edition. If you only read one part of the book, read the last chapter. It is light on story and gives a nice concise summary of the steps to take to become a serving leader."}, {"userName": "Dennis Higgins", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16618058-dennis-higgins", "userReview": "Inspiring and energetic.
