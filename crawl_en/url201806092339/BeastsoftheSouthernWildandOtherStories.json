Like a turtle, laying eggs\" (14) \"I put Flick's paper in my pocketbook and there, inside, on a round mirror, my face is waiting in ambush for me.\" (31)\"Wanda unpinned her bun and the hair fell below her shoulders and tickled her spine. It was the color, she thought, of harmless brown garden snakes.\" (135)She also delves into dream and the fantastic in this book -- marvelously strange.

These stories show her to be a descendant of Flannery O'Connor (especially in The Ugliest Pilgrim) and a predecessor of George Saunders and Wells Tower: she focuses on Southern working-class people, but with a touch of the grotesque/absurd. Although published in 1973, this collection tackled issues that can still be controversial today: lesbianism, mental illness, abortion, interracial liaisons, and ambivalence about motherhood. Highly recommended for fans of Southern literature. I especially loved the chilling ending of The Spider Gardens of Madagascar."}, {"userName": "Vel Veeter", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69444656-vel-veeter", "userReview": "So you should know right off the bat that this book was not the inspiration or original version of the movie from a few years back. And you should also know that it\u2019s unfortunate they took the title, because this is a really strong collection and the title story is pretty much perfect.This collection has nine stories and Doris Betts is incredibly wry, wicked, funny, and poignant of a writer. The collection opens with \u201cUgly Pilgrim\u201d about a disfigured woman running away. Other of the shorter stories includes the \u201cHitch-Hiker\u201d and \u201cMother in Law\u201d. By the time we get to the title story, it just becomes completely unhinged.The story is about a teacher in a high school whose school and home-life are demanding, awful, hilariously rough, and so dreams about a kind of almost utopian space where she can love another man and send her own husband to some kind of prison. The scenes in the schoolhouse are hilarious and so true to life. It\u2019s a nice reminder how much of stories about school are rightfully told from the perspective of kids who have been abused by the system and not enough about teachers who are also abused by the system. Her description of kids asking to turn in anything, anything to stand in for what is assigned is hilariously accurate and a little reassuring given it\u2019s 45 years later and still happens.The rest of the collection is mostly good with one or two stories being less than that. One more story really shines, and that is \u201cStill Life with Fruit\u201d which tells of a truly nightmarish hospital stay of a woman ten days past her due date."}, {"userName": "Alex", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13032337-alex", "userReview": "The last story is great, the others (that I read) are meh."}, {"userName": "MB Shakespeare", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/78667658-mb-shakespeare", "userReview": "Amazing short stories!"}, {"userName": "Fionna Guillaume", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47177444-fionna-guillaume", "userReview": "An odd, beautiful, and unnerving collection of stories. Unapologetically told from the White, female, Southern perspective, these delve into a variety of topics - childbirth; faith healing; interracial sex; dreamworld journeys - that I found both strange and mesmerizing.

My partner saw the play Violet and brought the book home from the library to read the story it is based on. I picked it up and started reading these surreal stories that come out of Southern Grotesque writing. They are surprising and intense. Violet is the young woman in the story, The Ugliest Pilgrim, she has a wound on her face and is on a journey to get it healed and restore her beauty by a radio minister, who of course is a sham.A review of the play: http://www.dramainthehood.net/2016/03...The last story in the book, \"Benson Watts Is Dead and in Virginia,\" three dead people travel across a landscape. The woman is pregnant and doesn't know she is dead. Then a man shows up who knows 'the rules' to avoid going back. They are: 1-Dwell, then travel, 2-Join forces, 3-Disremember. So off they go, they build a large canoe from a tree to take them down a river. Eventually they wind up in a large body of water and on an island. We are totally drawn in to their wandering lives. One day the woman deflates and is dead, again, the first man is left alone like he started. I love the sentence in this story, \"He stayed gone a long time.\" Also from the Tibet Book of the Dead, it is 49 days for the amount of time it takes to pass between death and further life.In the story, \"The Spider Gardens of Madagascar\" a young man learns his father died in a car crash, his mother survived. We begin to learn about their relationship, he knows she was the cause of his father's death. He starts collecting spiders for a school project knowing she is not interested in spiders, he must do something she will not infringe upon. We feel her overbearing nature and his recoil. He grooms poisonous black widow spiders and the final line of the story is, \"Someday soon, Coker was going to have to decide where he would turn her and her children loose\u2014in Lillian's room, or his.\" I'm glad this book showed up by accident, it holds many strong emotions in each story. And each story creates it's own world. The title of the book has no relationship to the movie of the same name."}, {"userName": "Larry  ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56994903-larry", "userReview": "Like some others, I sought out this book because the excellent musical \u201cViolet\u201d was based on the first of the stories in this collection, but I read all the way through.\t\tSo, first: that story, \u201cThe Ugliest Pilgrim\u201d is a rather slight tale of a young scarred woman who travels to see a healing preacher, and meets a couple of soldiers on the trip. It is the only upbeat story in the collection. I have to say that the authors of the musical expanded the story creatively and intelligently. \tI\u2019d never heard of Doris Betts. The stories mostly describe disturbed or mistreated women and my first reaction along the way was that they would have appeared in women\u2019s magazines - but I see from the copyright page that those published prior to the book were in literary magazines. While for the most part, the stories didn\u2019t seem so outstanding to me, Betts is a good writer with clean prose that I very much admired, and is able to capture shaded and unstable moods. She didn\u2019t shy from describing bodily functions. Only one story seemed to me true southern gothic; only one ended on a false note; the final story is a lovely, dreamlike tale of some kind of purgatory.\t\u201cStill Life with Fruit\u201d is a harrowing tale of an ordinary birth. I liked the ending: \u201cSomething crawled under her skin, like the spider who webbed her eyelids tightening all lines. In both her eyes, the spider spilled her hot, wet eggs - those on the right for bitterness, and those on the left for joy.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Garrett", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7857026-garrett", "userReview": "I don't think I'm sophisticated enough for short story collections. I find myself at the end of most short stories asking, \"Okay, but what was the point of that?\"I learned about a sub-genre whilst reading this - \"Southern Grotesque.\" This would include Flanery O'Connor (high school required reading), Harry Crews (tiresome), Cormac McCarthy (an endurance test in every volume), Carson McCullers (a secret joy), William Faulkner (classic), and among others, Ms. Betts here. I have EXTREMELY mixed reactions to tales which incorporate casual cruelty, cheap lives, predominate religion and throwaway racism as parts of the \"Southern experience\" without really drawing any particular conclusions about them, but I'm mistaken, because Ms. Betts taught at University, and I am a blunt tool which, unless properly oriented, misses the point. What I know is that my experience as a Southerner is never quite captured and much of what I read rings hollow.That said, a couple of these stories are entertaining in the way of old Twilight Zones episodes, while other meander without traveling. The characters are engaging, but the women are often broad sweeps while the most engaging character for me was a child. (Again, this could be all about me.) At least two tales here seem to be indulgences of then taboo mixed race romance fantasies of the late 70s. She's a descriptive craftsperson and wonderful on occastion with words, but I was often left wanting more, or possibly less."}, {"userName": "Synthia ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5445655-synthia", "userReview": "I only actually read the first story in the book. \"The Ugliest Pilgrim\"which I read because it is the story that the Broadway musical \"Violet\" that I recently saw is based on. It was cool to see Sutton Foster play the leading role. She did a fantastic job!\"Violet\" (the play) ends differently than \"The Ugliest Pilgrim\" (the book) which disappointed Kary even though he loved the musical/play despite the wrong ending. We chose to see Violet because Kary teaches the story. I think the ending of \"The Ugliest Pilgrim\" is more realistic for the 1960's story that it is; whereas, the ending of Violet is done to intrigue the more modern thinkers. The new ending didn't quite make sense to me when I saw the play. I was happy to, afterwards, read the story and see that the ending made better sense.The story shows how a difficult life can turn hopeful even though we realize that Violet's (the heroin's) plans to overcome her difficulties are unrealistic and look totally non-hopeful. The musical (of course) was much more fun than the story. However, I did enjoy reading it and can recommend it but once was enough.

It has _nothing_ to do with the movie of the same name, which is based on a different short story altogether. Doris Betts, instead, writes disconcerting stories, usually centered on American white people in the 1950s. Many of the stories include attention to heterosexual flirtation, disability, the aching contradictions of hope, and the racism of the protagonists. Even more disturbingly, Betts includes a speculative story set in some post-revolutionary 1950s America where Blacks have established brutal slavery over southern whites. The story centers on the sexual relationship between a white slave and her black master. Whatever nuance the story may offer, it also advances a version of post-revolutionary society that corresponds closely to the paranoid hysteria of the racist imagination. As post-revolutionary depictions go, it is the most reactionary I have encountered. _Beasts of the Southern Wild_ is, all in all, a book of racist short stories about racist people."}, {"userName": "Elise", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/984798-elise", "userReview": "This collection of short stories contains one of my absolute favorites, \"The Ugliest Pilgrim.\" It is so exquisitely written with more said in 29 pages than most authors say in works 10 times as long. Violet Karl, a disfigured young woman, is traveling by bus from NC to Tulsa to be healed by a televangelist. Cruelty, humor, hypocrisy, and courage are all on display around her. The story contains my favorite ending in all of literature as Violet is being chased by the soldier that she meets & falls for on the journey (\"But he's running as hard as he can and he's faster than me. And, oh! Praise God! He's catching me!\").

It had all the elements. Good prose, at times amazing. The stories are all pretty dark which I also usually like. All these stories are too similar. It's like- I get it already this person is depressed- repressed- doesn't give a shit. Too much illness? Cancer? Too much emotional disconnection that it's unsettling? There are so many things that I usually like in writing that I guess they all start to work against each other- Doris Betts is trying to hard I think as I am reading it- even though she has the chops to make almost no effort. Why?! I stumbled through a lot of these, frustrated that they drug on and on and on, so thick with dark foreshadowing ....
