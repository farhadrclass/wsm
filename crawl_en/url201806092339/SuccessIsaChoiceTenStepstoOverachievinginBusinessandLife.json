I read the book after reading Malcolm Gladwell's \"Outliers\" and thought that the two complimented each other well. The book talks about being positive, hard-work, adapting, and refusing to quit. I know those sound like obvious things for success but you get a perspective on it Rick Pitino style. Haven't you ever wondered why professional athletes are so fit, successful and on top of their game? Wouldn't you like to have a similar aura about you? I'm anything but a sports fan, and that's perhaps why I liked the book as much as I did. It was an interesting look at one person's idea of success."}, {"userName": "Mugizi Rwebangira", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71595-mugizi-rwebangira", "userReview": "So, I am kinda burnt out a bit on the self-help genre, not sure why I picked this one up.The advice is very conventional in many ways: work hard, believe in yourself, have persistence, don't be overwhelmed by failure, nothing really new here.HOWEVER ... I did find the specific way that Pitino applied his techniques to his coaching to be interesting. It's clear that Pitino (at least according to him and the testimonials), particularly excelled at motivating players. He is not the greatest X and Os guy out there, but he really knows his players psychology and can figure out how to get any guy to work really hard.That is something I have to think about really hard in any role I get where I manage people."}, {"userName": "Don", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28509928-don", "userReview": "This was a required book back in college for a psych class, Human Potential. This changed a lot of my views at the time and continues to influence me. I will go back to this from time to time when i need an extra kick. I like the way he breaks things down, explains, and summarizes in \"key points\" at the end of each chapter. This is nothing like his other book \"Lead To Succeed.\" This book has a much more positive feel and spin to it all. He does use basketball but it's not distracting. Real life applications that can be used in a myriad of situations and circumstances despite age and experience. I used points from this later in life as a mental health counselor and for my \"Goals and motivations\" classes I had with clients. From the \"troubled youth\" to the domestic violence victims. It's a wonderful book for goals and motivation. In my opinion, if that's what you are looking for, then get this. I would say it would go in my top 5 in this category."}, {"userName": "Kelle Campbell", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41003361-kelle-campbell", "userReview": "This was my second time reading \"Success is a Choice,\" and I'll probably read it again in another year or two. Rick Pitno breaks down the habits of success in a way that's easy to understand and sparks ideas on how to make improvements in my own life. For example, part of Step #10 is figuring out what strategies and approaches worked, and using that insight for the next endeavor. I had been feeling \"stuck\" recently in terms of being motivated for a non-client project, but that advice led me to examine what I'd done in the past to achieve success, and I now have an idea of what to do.All in all, an extremely useful book to have on one's bookshelf!"}, {"userName": "Mike Bercier", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18075582-mike-bercier", "userReview": "I really enjoyed reading this book. I really like how the book was laid out in the steps. I also liked how at the end of each chapter that there was a summary of the key points from each chapter. I realize now that all too often kids receive praise without even earning or what Rick Pitino says \"deserve it\". It also talks about how we sometimes set the bar on ourselves too low which I can see in myself. I have applied the 3rd step on always being positive and it has changed the way I carry myself day to day. People have taken notice including my wife which is so very important to me. Everything from establishing good habits to learning from role models (people who can teach us good things not from someone just because they are famous. We have to be able to pick ourselves up and dust ourselves off when faced with adversity and learn from it. The point that really hit home is when I do hit my goals and reach my dreams that the hard work to get there is a must if I want to stay on top. I highly recommend this book if you have goals and dreams that you are striving for but aren't sure how to achieve them."}, {"userName": "Suzanne Moore", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2127114-suzanne-moore", "userReview": "You are never too old to change! Rick Pitino motivates the reader with examples from his experiences as a basketball coach. Although sports might not be your career, these examples can be applied to both working and personal goals. This book offers a list of ten strategies for achieving success.I liked the example he gave of Spencer Johnson\u2019s book, \u201cThe Precious Present.\u201d We can\u2019t change the past, so don\u2019t beat yourself up over mistakes. Prepare for the future, but don\u2019t dwell on it constantly. Be happy today and enjoy each precious moment. The present is where you are; a gift you give to yourself.Another idea that I thought was meaningful is to have a PhD attitude, and build relationships (teams) from those who have a PhD. Be Poor/Prepared-Hungry-Driven. If you are hiring staff or applying for a position, this quality is one that will lead to success. Poor, not as in poverty but as lacking knowledge or skills. This leads to being hungry for learning, and driven to succeed.Read this book if you want to reach success!"}, {"userName": "Gary Branger", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5379336-gary-branger", "userReview": "Re-Reading this book. Read it when it first came out in 1997. Remember buying it at a Barnes & Noble in Phoenix while on a business trip. I realize life changing is a pretty bold statement and this book was for me. As I read it again, I'm trying to connect with what this did for me at the time. One thing I remember about this book was it at a time I realized the gifts I were given were different than I thought I wanted them to be. At the time, I wanted to be anything but what I was doing. (was pursuing a career as a firefighter - on the side) Around the time I read this book, I either realized I didn't have the abilities to become a firefighter or I was pretty good at what I was doing (IT and solving problems). From there my whole approach to work changed. Now as an IT Manager, I am seeing this from a much different perspective and it provides different lessons for me. Purchased a copy for my 19yo son with the idea it can have at least half the impact on him at 19 as it did on my at 31."}, {"userName": "Barry Davis", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52751605-barry-davis", "userReview": "Subtitled \u201cten steps to overachieving in business and life,\u201d Pitino draws on his years as a cocky basketball player from NY to his career (ups and downs) as a coach in both the professional and college circuits.

In the 1990s, I watched the Duke/ Kentucky Elite Eight game, but I was cheering for the other side. That being said, Pitino always seemed to have more class that most college basketball coaches of his era. The book is well laid out, easy to follow and with plenty of action steps. I could imagine Pitino coaching his players as I read the book. He's one of those \"Just get off of your butt and do it\" guys who inspires you instead of making your feel like he's lecturing you.It's a good read, and I've often recommended it as a self help book to others."}, {"userName": "Parker", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47068953-parker", "userReview": "I have bought this book, I think about 5 times.
