Patience, the protagonist, lived a life that no one could even imagine-twice abducted by Boko Haram, seeing her husband's decapitaded head laying on the ground, and giving birth alone, in the jungle. She survived all those horrendous events, and much more, ultimately being gifted with a beautiful daughter.The author, Andrea Hoffmann, is a skilled author and journalist who won the trust and friendship of her protagonist. I appreciated reading and hearing Patience's story told her way and in her words, rather than how the author thinks it should be told. Hoffman also writes about her desire to fly to dangerous northern Nigeria, meeting up with a missionary, and accompanying her there. Meeting and interviewing Patience and other women was a brave and selfless act that assisted in getting more of the story of the Boko Haram atrocities out into the world.I commend Ms. Hoffmann on her exceptional book and her career as a writer of human rights stories.Thank you NetGalley."}, {"userName": "Mpho Bernadette", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15161587-mpho-bernadette", "userReview": "One definitely needs therapy to read the horrific contents of this book. At some point I cried while reading and in some areas I almost vomited because I was literally sick to my stomach. This book is not for the faint hearted. That aside, I did not fully understand what the Chibok girls and all the women who were kidnapped by Boko Haram went through and are still going through until I read the book. I am still unable to grasp what type of a person is ok doing such inhumane things to another. How do you become that kind of person? How do you sleep at night when I as a reader can barely sleep after reading this book? This book just validates how strong women are. Patience is one hell of a woman and I don't think I would survive even half the things that they had to endure in those camps."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9175928-barbara", "userReview": "An amazing memoir of a survivor of Boko Haram and the journalist who tells her story. Brave, harrowing and sheds light on women's plight in the most dire of circumstances. The bravery and resilience of this young mother to be is inspiring. What a mother does for her child? Everything and anything."}, {"userName": "Yibbie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40823165-yibbie", "userReview": "Hoffman has written an incredibly engrossing book. She tells the story of her journey to Nigeria and introduces us to Patience as she meets her. Then she lets her tell us her story. I knew when I requested this book that it was going to be hard, violent, and for a mature audience. I realized that horrendous, unspeakable things were done to her. I\u2019ve read enough books about the Holocaust, the killing fields, and the Rwandan genocide to have been prepared ever so slightly for what it might be like.  However, I only made it halfway through the book. Up to that point, she was very delicate about the intimate aspects of her marriages. Then she described her rape in great detail, way too much detail. I was expecting that it would be part of her story but would be handled more delicately.  The Christianity spoke of is very nominal. They go to church regularly, but she enters a polygamous marriage that\u2019s winked at by church and encouraged by her family. I couldn\u2019t really tell what her view of salvation was. There was a lot of talk about losing salvation, but it sounded like they considered themselves Christian just because they were born to certain families. Religion really wasn\u2019t the focus of the book. It was just about Patience and her story.  I received this as a free ARC from NetGalley and Other Press. No favorable review was required. These are my honest opinions."}, {"userName": "Aggie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12773150-aggie", "userReview": "This is a profoundly sad book, triumphant in spirit but an incredible reminder of what we are ignoring across the globe. Patience wears her daughter in a traditional wrap much like the different ones I used on my three little ones. The opening where we meet them and the little girl reaches around for breast milk reminds me so much of mothering my own children, I immediately felt a warmth and connection to the story.While we have aid workers in this area of the world, it seems too horrific and widespread to conquer. The women volunteers are a drip in an ocean of evil, but their spirit is so encouraging.Disturbing and heartwarming in different parts, I highly recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Jeanette Blain", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3476302-jeanette-blain", "userReview": "A Gift From Darkness is a vivid and straightforward nightmare in the land of Boko Haram. Journalist Andrea Hoffman travels to Maiduguri, Nigeria and talks to Patience Ibrahim, who gives a first-hand account of seeing family and neighbors murdered as terrorists attack and occupy the rural farming communities that she calls home. She herself is abducted twice and escapes twice, but cannot escape the fear and horror as the brutal group expands its territory. For a few hours, I felt almost as though I was part of Patience's horrific world. I'm glad I read this story, and that she had a chance to tell it.

A tough story to read but something that definitely must be shared."}, {"userName": "Cynthia", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7581580-cynthia", "userReview": "Patience, a young Christian living in northern Nigeria, has experienced the kind of trauma that many of us could only read about. At times, her story made me so overcome with emotion that I didn't know if I could continue reading. In fact, several times I wanted to abandon the book, but quickly admonished myself as I realized that I had the privilege of distancing myself from these traumatic experiences, but she, and others like her, did not. I felt it was my duty to continue reading because Patience and other Boko Haram victims need people like me to be made aware of what is happening in Nigeria.While there were times when I knew the language didn't quite \"fit\", I understood that this was due to the translating. Nonetheless, I am grateful that Patience found the courage to share her painfully traumatic story. I'm left, once again, feeling as if the global community needs to do better. Everyone needs to read this book to know fully the horrors that northern Nigerians are experiencing."}, {"userName": "Janet", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7306509-janet", "userReview": "I received an Advance Reader Copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. From the publisher - The inspirational story of a pregnant young Nigerian woman and the horrors she endured to save her unborn child when she was kidnapped by Boko Haram. When she was nineteen, Patience Ibrahim's first husband was murdered by Boko Haram. She fled to the safety of her village and remarried several months later. Having prayed for a child for years, Patience is overjoyed when she discovers she is pregnant. But her joy is short-lived: Boko Haram soldiers are at her door. Brutally abducted and forced to convert to Islam, she lives in constant terror of what her kidnappers have in store for her. She finds herself alone in the world and fears her life is over. For two months, Patience hides her pregnancy while facing the brutalities meted out by Boko Haram. By the sheer force of her determination to protect her baby, she and her child are able to survive. Now, she has entrusted journalist Andrea C. Hoffmann with her story, a powerful first-person account of Boko Haram's atrocities in Nigeria and Cameroon. One of the first testimonies on the terrorist group's war crimes in Western Africa, A Gift from Darkness poignantly shows the human toll of a crisis that demands attention.One of the things I like about non-fiction is finding stories that are hard to stomach realities and learning from them. This is NOT an easy book to read and what Ms. Ibrahim went through was brutal and beyond horrible. Losing her first husband and then potentially losing her unborn child made Patience a WARRIOR in my opinion! I cannot even imagine surviving what she went through and the whole world should know her story. In my opinion, terrorism on any level is a sign of one's weakness on behalf of the perpetrator --- they cannot think of something smart or sane to do so they go all out and do evil, ridiculous things. Pity that these men ran into Patience as she was not putting up with their .... ummmm .... stuff. This book should be part of every modern history curriculum as it shows that sometimes the terrorists not only don't win but they fail completely!"}, {"userName": "Jeanna Rodgers", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20305576-jeanna-rodgers", "userReview": "What an awful read. :( Awful because of the subject matter. I find it so hard to comprehend what some people have to deal with - through no fault of their own - and I am amazed that Patience even managed to survive - AND had a baby on her own too.Very thankful that I have never had to deal with any of the experiences that Patience deals with.

(Of the 276 kidnapped, 100 are still missing.) However, this is the story of a young wife, who, at the age of 19, had already lost one husband to Boko Haram's violence. She was remarried and newly pregnant when Boko Haram came to her new village and kidnapped her and other Christian women. She escaped, only to be recaptured days later by another band of marauders. A humane guard helped her escape yet once more. She and two other women traveled on foot to cross the border into Cameroon, where they were reunited with family members. Sadly, Boko Haram's violence reached them even there. While heavily pregnant Patience hid, her husband ran into the bush for his life. (To be fair to him, men were generally killed outright; women might be captured.) When the raid was over, Patience searched for her husband, only to find he had been beheaded. Patience's story of courage, faith, and strength is unbelievable. After giving birth to her daughter alone in the wilderness, Patience found refuge in northern Nigeria at a Catholic enclave. There, she was interviewed by German journalist Andrea Hoffmann. This is a valuable book to read. Although it suffers from a few odd typos, it is compelling reading. How little we know of Boko Haram's depredations! Sadly enough, it may be said that we care very little as well. Just days ago, another school was attacked at Dapchi, Nigeria. Witnesses claim that more than ninety were kidnapped, more than seventy were rescued, and that two girls were killed. The violence, although it has abated, has not ended. Many, many women could add their voices to Patience's story."}, {"userName": "Robyn", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13035131-robyn", "userReview": "I like to enter Goodreads Giveaways for the chance to read books that I might not otherwise consider, for whatever reason: too dark, too heavy, too depressing. And yes, this book is at times difficult to read, with its honest and vivid portrayal of violence, but as a whole, it was worth it.Stories like Patience's need to be told in order to get even a glimmer of understanding what it's like living in fear of Boko Haram. You don't want to believe that this evil exists, that people are capable of committing these atrocities, but there's a witness here willing to share her experience.I also appreciate Andrea Hoffmann's ability to understand what needs to be placed in context, details of Patience's life and explanations of her culture. Ultimately this is a story of survival that I would recommend to anyone as long as they're prepared to read it."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59237060-anne", "userReview": "This is the story of Patience, who in her short life has experienced and witnessed things that no-one should be exposed to.
