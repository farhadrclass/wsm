Jennings was a book I almost gave up on. To be completely frank, I had a very hard time liking Kami at the beginning and with my dislike came this emotional detachment. I even stopped reading the book for some time and picked it up once again to give it one more go. When I began reading once again, things changed for me. I saw Kami in a new light and I have to admit that Blaine\u2019s swoony magnificence played a big role in turning things around for me. With respect to Kami, there came a point in the book where her fears, pain and suffering were so powerful and tangible that I could not help but feel for her. Fear of Falling went from a book that I could barely get through to one that was unputdownable! I am so glad I have this one a second chance.KAMI:\nI was never one to believe in fairytales. I always figured that when things were too good to be true that they were just that \u2013 a beautiful lie.*Sex was my band-aid over the bullet wound that was my scarred psyche.\nFear of Falling is essentially about twenty-three year old Kamilla Duvall. Kami\u2019s tragic past has shaped her. Molded her into someone who believes they are not worthy of being loved and also incapable returning that same emotion. Kami lives her life utterly paralyzed by her fears. She has somehow accepted that this is how she is and somewhere along the way Kami stopped believing in her own happiness. Perhaps she never believed in it from the start. Things change unexpectedly when she meets a sexy tattooed bartender one night at a bar. The attraction was undeniable. However, for once in her life, it was much more than simple chemistry. Never being one to rise to the challenge, Kami does what she always does...she runs. BLAINE:\nHe was frighteningly beautiful; a rare work of art that needed to be admired and thoroughly explored.\nBlaine Jacobs is this sexy and mysterious bartender/ bar owner who is battling his own inner demons. The tragedy in his past has left him mentally scarred but he has somehow pushed past his inner turmoil and opted to simply live his life. I loved how infectious he was, how you could not help but like him (and swoon over him) immediately. When he meets Kami for the first time at his bar, her sadness called to him. Something deep within him shifted and he somehow knew that Kami was worth the pursuit.S.L. Jennings definitely wrote about a tough subject matter in this book. Like I mentioned earlier in this review, at first I was not so sure about Kami. I didn\u2019t like how she was towards the opposite sex and how that made her seem so callous. Once I got more of her back story, I began to understand where she was coming from. The unimaginable hell that she lived in for her entire young life created such deep, deep layers of pain and self-loathing. This is a girl who does not really know love or understand it. Therefore, how can you receive and give something that you are incapable of understanding? She had horrifying things done to her as a child which made her associate love with something that was evil. All this was ingrained in her psyche from a young age. When Blaine comes into the picture and begins to show Kami how life could be different and what love can feel like, I truly did understand her fear. I further understood that with Kami it would be a long journey, one that would have many ups and downs in order for her to finally reach that final place of peace. One thing that I commend this author on is the fact that she took such a damaged girl and brought her to life. I literally felt Kami\u2019s pain. It poured off the pages of my kindle. I will forever remember Kami as one of the most intensely broken girls that I have ever read.What happens when you desperately want to save someone who does not want to be saved???To me, Blaine was utter perfection. Blaine was simply a beacon of light in the darkness that was Kami\u2019s world. He gave Kami hope in her world of heartbreak and torment. I did at times think he was too good to be true but this is a romance and what\u2019s a good romance without a very shiny white knight? Blaine takes it upon himself to be the one that saves Kami and I think that he never really understood that she needed to be the one that saved herself until he was slapped in the face with Kami\u2019s hurtful ways. This need to save Kami, to heal her, is something he immersed himself in and fought so hard for. One thing you are unable to deny is his love for Kami. It was as fierce as it was all consuming. All in all, Fear of Falling is a tale about a very broken girl. It is her story of how she finally managed to get to the place where conquering her demons was no longer so frightening to her. It is a story about how she finds love, but also learns how to accept it and bask in its warmth and tenderness. Not all women who have been abused and scarred find their Blaine. Kami did. And, it is beautiful. To have this author tell a tale with so much heartache and then give us insurmountable joy is worth the journey that it takes to get there."}, {"userName": "Christy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11284813-christy", "userReview": "5 Origami Stars!!!!!\nMy name is Kami and I am constantly afraid. And the thing that scares me the most is the very thing I want.\u2028Kami has spent her whole life afraid. Afraid of what? The answer to that is simple... pretty much everything. It all stemmed from her abusive childhood. There are only two people in the world she trusts, feels safe with. Her best friends, her family, Dom and Angel. She doesn\u2019t let anyone else in. Ever. Then one day, she meets him... Blaine. He changes everything. \nBlaine is instantly enthralled by Kami. He wants to know her. From the moment he first meets her, he can tell something is different about her. Kami gets a job in Blaine\u2019s bar. The more he gets to know her, the more he wants to know. For the first time ever, Kami is slowly letting someone in. Blaine see\u2019s the fears Kami has. All he wants to do is shut them off. \n\u201cYour fears are not you. Do you hear me? They don't define who you are.\u201d \n \nKami\u2019s fears are much more complex than Blaine could have imagined. She has some real reasons for her fears. They might seem a little extreme and excessive, but once you hear her story, it all makes sense. \n\u2018The real monsters aren\u2019t stalking in the shadows with masks and butcher knives. They don\u2019t have fangs or claws. They\u2019re all around us, hiding in plain sight. That\u2019s why they\u2019re so scary.\u201d\n\u2028Kami and Blaine\u2019s relationship is complicated to say the least. Kami is broken. Her fears consume her. No matter how much Blaine trys to help her... \n\n\u201cYou can't expect to save someone that doesn't want to be saved.\u201d \n\n\u2028But he\u2019s always there. No matter what. He is falling in love with her. All he wants is to help heal her. For her to know that he is there. She can trust him. \n\n\u201cDon't worry,\" he smiled, pulling me into the hard warmth of his chest. \"I've got you. I'll always catch you when you fall.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cFear isn\u2019t all you have. You have me. If you want me, you have me.\u201d\nBlaine is breaking down every wall Kami has ever put up. And it scares her. It scares her more than anything. She can\u2019t fall for him. Sometimes, no matter how hard you try... you can only shut off your feelings for so long. This is my absolute favorite part of the book. \n\n\n\u201cHe was't just my exception. He was my reason.\u201d\n\n\nBlaine was the best. Tattooed, pierced. He was so supportive, loving, patient, kind, and understanding with Kami. I can\u2019t express to you how much I adored this man. He gave her so much hope. So much encouragement. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a fighter, babe. You aren\u2019t afraid. You aren\u2019t crazy. You. Are. A. Fighter.\u201d\n\n Blaine made her feel like she could trust someone again. Possibly love someone for the first time. Kami had Blaine from the beginning. No matter what she was going through, he was going to be there for her. He wasn\u2019t letting go. \nThis is truly one of the most beautiful love stories, but it\u2019s not always a happy story. It\u2019s got a lot of dark parts. Kami\u2019s past is ugly. It broke her, shattered her. When Kami finally starts to let her walls down, something happens. Someone from her past comes back. I lost it. It made me a nervous wreck- I was fearful for Kami, heartbroken and devastated. This is such an emotional story. From page one, all the way to the end, you will feel. Feel for Kami and her horrific past. Feel for Blaine and everything he\u2019s going through. And oh my God.... Dom and Angel. Dom\u2019s story broke my heart. I just absolutely loved these characters. In the end, Kami realized there is only one real thing to be afraid of:\nI\u2019m not afraid Of monsters and ghostsBut the thought of losing youIs what scares me the most.\nFear of Falling was a real story, about real people with real issues. Kami\u2019s story is gut-wrenching. Kami might seem weak at first. Once you know her story, you will realize just how strong she really is. She has been through so much tragedy, so much pain, she thought there was no way to ever get away from it. No way she would ever be able to conquer her fears.But sometimes, life surprises you. Sometimes, someone can come along and change everything. \nBlaine was my more.\n\u2028Beautiful. Emotional. Powerful. Inspiring. A tale of a girl with a damaged past, who is fearful, suffering and broken. But more importantly, it\u2019s a story about love, overcoming those fears, and hope. There is always hope, and life is always beautiful!"}, {"userName": "Kristin (KC) - Traveling Sister", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4971692-kristin-kc---traveling-sister", "userReview": "*2.5 Stars*The beginning of this book had me. Its gripping intro proposed an intense storyline filled with a mystery that would surround darker issues. While the dark topics were present, they merely served as a backdrop for an otherwise 'fluffy' story. The inconsistent plot, although somewhat intriguing, unfortunately never seemed to reach its full potential. We're initially introduced to our heroine, Kami, who suffers a crippling anxiety derived from a grotesquely abusive childhood. Her tragic past was revealed through flashbacks, and was painful to witness. She deems herself 'unlovable' and has remained emotionally scarred and unattached for years. Enter Blaine...Blaine was an immediate attraction for me Kami. Sexy, strong, mysterious--and battling demons of his own. I loved their initial flirtatious banter and was excited to see things play out. Blaine was patient, understanding, and just a perfect source of security for Kami. Almost too perfect. This is where the story began to lose me...Kami and Blaine's complex relationship, although extremely sexy, rode an emotional roller coaster for the entirety of this story. While Kami's reluctance to let her guard down was warranted, the scenarios began to play on repeat and completely swallowed up the plot. The ending presented more intensity, but some of it seemed slightly over-the-top. The writing had its moments of brilliance and truly thrived during the reflective narration. The character dialogue was natural and blunt, giving off a slight KA vibe at times. Blaine would randomly and frequently come out with these Confucius-like pep talks\u2014which was both astounding and bewildering.Although this story didn't work for me, I did appreciate and respect its powerful message against domestic abuse and felt that it was handled tactfully, but with vigor.\n\nBook Stats:\n\u25aa\t Genre/Category: Contemporary Romance \u25aa\t Steam Caliber: Extremely steamy\u25aa Romance: Complex and shaky.

We found out just how awful life could really be. We found out that monsters were, indeed, real. They walked among us. They looked just like you and me. They came in the form of people we loved and trusted the most. The people whose only job was to love and protect us.\u201d - Kami\nIt took me a little while to formulate my thoughts after I finished reading Fear of Falling and this review was extremely hard to write. There was something about Kami's story that resonated with me deeply. Her fears. Her thoughts. Just honestly her! She was the reason that I loved this book. Sitting back and thinking about it I'd describe this book as a hurricane. It hits you hard and floods each and everyone of your five sense, causing a raging storm within your mind and body. You want to escape the hurt, the pain, the angst, but you can't! You're trapped, being whipped around in the wind, thunder and torrential rain that is Kami and Blaine's relationship. These two beautifully broken people are destined, like the stars in the sky, to be each others safe house, each others escapes. Through the ebbs and flows of their rocky relationship you see glimmers of light within Kami and Blaine's tortured pasts. The sky clearing one cloud at a time. Hope glistening like raindrops on the tips of a flower petal. These people need each other. They need each other like you and I need our next breath to live and in that need, that desperation, that longing Kami finds healing and I think Blaine does too. Is it a pretty story? No. Is it easy? No. But sometimes in life there's nothing pretty or easy. Kami has suffered through the worst and most unimaginable forms of abuse and Blaine has been through his share of trauma too. Healing when you\u2019ve been broken, battered and abused is not easy. Fear can be gripping and that...THAT is the point of the book. You can choose to be whole, healthy and happy. No matter what\u2019s happened to you, you can make a choice to not allow the evil, horrible life experiences you\u2019ve had have power over you. You can choose life and to live. You are worth that choice. You are worth every moment of happiness and bliss. You can find love, live life and be whole. NO ONE should ever take that away from you. I would absolutely recommend Fear of Falling. Abuse is not pretty but I think S.L. Jennings does a beautiful job of laying it out there for us. She paints that picture and our hearts bleed for these characters. A definite MUST READ! What is Fear of Falling about?I can\u2019t remember the last time I felt completely safe. Security seemed more like a luxury to me, reserved for those who were fortunate enough to have picture perfect childhoods. For those who didn\u2019t bear the ugly scars that keep me bound in constant, debilitating fear. I\u2019ve run from that fear my entire life. But when I met him, for once, I couldn\u2019t run anymore.He scared the hell out of me in a way that excited every fiber of my being. It wasn\u2019t the tattoos or the piercings. It wasn\u2019t the warmth that seemed to radiate from his frame and blanket me whenever he was near. It was just\u2026him. The scary beautiful man that threatened to alter 23 years of routine and rituals, and make me face my crippling fear.My name is Kami and I am constantly afraid. And the thing that scares me the most is the very thing I want.\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he smiled, pulling me into the hard warmth of his chest. \u201cI\u2019ve got you. I\u2019ll always catch you when you fall.\u201dAnd just like that, Blaine had staked his claim on the untouched part of me that no living soul had ever moved. He had captured every fear, every reservation, and crushed them in the palm of his inked hand.I wanted to talk a little about Kami. I never suffer from \u201cwhiny girl complex\u201d when reading! I really don\u2019t! The girl could be needy, broken and completely frustrating but I always try to look deeper and explore what this girls been through and why she\u2019s doing the things she\u2019s doing. With Kami her layers of self loathing go deep. This sweet girl has never know an ounce of love. NOT.ONE.SINGLE.OUNCE. She has lived her life in a cocoon of torture. Can you imagine what that would be like? To see the unimaginable? To have the unthinkable done to YOU? Can you imagine seeing these things from the time you were a little girl and knew NOTHING better? These things are INGRAINED into your psyche. They are what form and mold your mind and thoughts. Kami was molded by nothing but complete fear and hatred. All she knows is torture and pain. So when Blaine comes around she can't just give into him. She can\u2019t just release all of her pain like he.s the answer to her prayers, some kind of God saving her. NO! It\u2019s taken YEARS to get to the messed up place she\u2019s at and it will take YEARS to move past that. This girl is BROKEN, TORTURED, DESTROYED. She is beautiful in spirit but mentally she is an absolute mess. So let me tell you prepare yourself for a girl that doesn\u2019t just give into the guy right away. She puts up a fight. A damn good one. She\u2019s scared and when fears the only thing you\u2019ve ever know it\u2019s not just a quick thing to let go of. You have to work your way through that and Kami had a TON of stuff she had to work through. \n\" The scariest part about love isn't love itself. It's letting go and plunging into the unknown. It's trusting someone with the very most sacred part of your heart. It's allowing yourself to feel something foreign and uncharted, despite how much it terrifies the hell out of you\" - Kami\nBlaine.....I think Blaine was amazing. There were moments in this book were I actually got a little pissed at him but unfortunately I can\u2019t put that in this review because I\u2019d consider it a spoiler. Blaine has his own set of problems. Ones that make him feel like crap and have mentally scarred him as well but the difference between Kami and Blaine, is that Blaine, chooses to live and not let it hold him down. Now, he hasn\u2019t been through what Kami\u2019s been through so it\u2019s easier for him to make that choice, IMO, but to me he represents life and hope for Kami. God...does he love her! He nurtures her and really wants to understand her. Kami is far from easy to deal with and I think that Blaine really gets that. He knows just what she needs and he tries to be everything he can for her. You see him struggle with the need to take her pain away. It's a need that saturates his soul and takes over his body. He wants to make her smile. He wants to heal her. And it's hard for Blaine to consistently be pushed away. Sometimes you can't save someone that doesn't want to be saved. You can't help someone that doesn't want to be helped. Sigh.....Blaine really hangs in there. He truly does. His love for this girl is FIERCE and If I had to describe him in one word it would be AMAZING. \n\"Kami, when you know, you know. And you don't fight it. You don't deny the inevitable. You free fall because you know there's someone there to catch you on the other side.\" .....\"You don't have to be afraid of falling. Just close your eyes, let go, and know that I'll always be here with arms outstretched, ready to catch you.\" - Blaine\nOverall I think you'll love this book. Kami and Blaine are incredible and S.L. Jennings writing is fantastic. Not only are Blaine and Kami fabulous but the supporting characters are pretty awesome as well. I would highly encourage you to take the leap. Try this book. There is a story here that's going to leave you thinking for hours. No matter what life hands you HANG ON, FIGHT and know without a shadow of a doubt that you are worth so much. You can have a good life just DON'T GIVE UP! My rating is 5 stars."}, {"userName": "DKristin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6655835-dkristin", "userReview": "Fear of Falling is essentially a love story, it is also a life story.

This doesn't even need my lame attempt at a review. July 18th is your friend, folks. Buy the book, grab your Kleenex, your favorite box of wine, then put on the 'DO NOT DISTURB ME' Face of Doom and lose yourself in this one! Tears and a wonderfully surprising amount of laughter + THE BEST epilogue = Perfection.\u00a0 I still stand by this statement, and I really don\u2019t believe the book needs my poor attempt at a review\u2026but, I\u2019ll do my best to expand on my initial thoughts just a bit.\u00a0Kamilla (Kami) Duvall was truly the center of this story and for very good reason.\u00a0 The last thing I want to do is give too much away.\u00a0 I actually want to give very little of the story away because I strongly feel the reader needs to experience everything without knowing the entire storyline beforehand.\u00a0 What I will say is that Kami was probably one of the most damaged and fearful young women I\u2019ve read about in a long time.\u00a0 At times, it was almost easy to forget that fact because she hid quite well behind a near-impenetrable wall, a mask, of normalcy, flirtatiousness, precociousness and lively humor.\u00a0 She and her two roommates and best friends, Angel and Dom\u2014Angel, a lesbian rocker, and Dom, a slutty man-ho, both with terrible pasts of their own, as well as huge, caring hearts\u2014were all, essentially, alone in the world, and they became a support system for one another.\u00a0 There were even moments where I wondered if the three weren\u2019t far too co-dependent and allowed some enabling to go on.\u00a0 But, even then, I couldn\u2019t possibly find a way to fault them for surviving in the best way they knew how, given their individual histories.\u00a0 Kami did not\u2014as in, not ever\u2014allow men to get close.\u00a0 Sex was one thing, intimacy was a whole other ballgame\u2026one she adamantly refused to play.\u00a0 Well, never say never.\u00a0 Enter, Blaine\u2026\u00a0Oh.

Jennings had me at that very moment.\u00a0 ROARRR!\u00a0 Blaine was a hot, sexy man-beast, and I wanted to just rub up against him and purrrr.\u00a0 The very best part, though\u2014and I mean the very best\u2014is the fact that he was such a genuinely decent, good\u2026good, good, good\u2026man.\u00a0 Gah!\u00a0 What I wouldn\u2019t do for a man like that!!\u00a0 Patient, understanding, kind, sexy (hey, how did that sneak in there again?!), loving.\u00a0 I feel I can\u2019t adequately express just how unbelievably patient, understanding, kind and loving this man was.\u00a0 God knows Kami was justified based on her horrific past, but wow.\u00a0 He put up with a lot from her, and I never recall him getting frustrated or angry or pushing her in any way.\u00a0 All he wanted, the only thing he wanted, was to love and support her.\u00a0 He was a beautiful, beautiful man, and calling him that in no way detracts from how\u2026manly and sexy this dude was.\u00a0 I want a Blaine.\u00a0 Someone find me a Blaine!!!\u00a0Blaine and Kami, together, had a combustible chemistry from the moment they clapped eyes on one another!\u00a0 Mercy, these two were sexy!!\u00a0 The tension kept ratcheting up between them, and I was waiting and waiting for the explosion.\u00a0 So.\u00a0 Worth.\u00a0 It.\u00a0 Even aside from their sexual relationship, simply watching the two of them grow together, learn about one another, build a tentative relationship\u2026it was so lovely.\u00a0 Their moments together were never wasted, and each built perfectly toward the conclusion.\u00a0 \u00a0One thing I have to mention, which I honestly wasn\u2019t expecting, is the amount of laughing I did while reading Fear of Falling, and I loved it!\u00a0 Kami, Angel and Dom know each other so well, and they have this ridiculously funny, crude sense of humor that unites the three of them.\u00a0 I so love when an author can successfully combine pain and humor in the same story.\u00a0 As I\u2019ve said before, it makes perfect sense as we often use humor to cover pain, and, as human beings, we also aren\u2019t ever feeling only one emotion.\u00a0 S.L. Jennings did this really well, and, in doing so, it helped to balance out the heavy weight this story would have been buried under without it.\u00a0 \u00a0Now.\u00a0 This has to be said, as well.\u00a0 There are heavy, serious subjects in Fear of Falling.\u00a0 Each of the characters has experienced such pain in his or her past, and it helped to shape who they became.\u00a0 However, as with anyone who has suffered a traumatic experience, that experience does not define that individual.\u00a0 Or, it shouldn\u2019t.\u00a0 In my opinion, Kami was allowing her past to define her, and in order to be able to move forward, she had to find a way to let that go.\u00a0 God knows, this was not made easy for her, particularly as there was unfinished business from her past.\u00a0 I\u2019m pretty sure I held my breath for most of the last 15% or so of this book, in between sobs.\u00a0 That last 15% is a doozy.\u00a0 I was terrified, furious, heartbroken and sick to my stomach.\u00a0 Then came the last several pages and the epilogue\u2026\u00a0That epilogue had me so joyous I was grinning from ear to ear, even while I cried and cried and cried.\u00a0 I adore a good epilogue!\u00a0 Well, this wasn\u2019t a good epilogue.\u00a0 This was a fan-freaking-tastic epilogue, and I\u2019ve re-read it multiple times already!!\u00a0 I plan to read it a dozen times more, as well!\u00a0 It was everything I needed to see between Blaine and Kami, and it was crafted flawlessly by S.L. Jennings.\u00a0See?\u00a0 I was right.\u00a0 This was all that really needed to be said: This doesn't even need my lame attempt at a review. July 18th is your friend, folks. Buy the book, grab your Kleenex, your favorite box of wine, then put on the 'DO NOT DISTURB ME' Face of Doom and lose yourself in this one!

It's a story that many of us can call our own. It's one that tells things that we are afraid to voice because if we do it'll become  real . It's a story about pain, suffering, abuse, and trying to break the vicious circle that we find ourselves reliving, retelling through our own lives. It's a story about hope. Kami is my hope. Blaine is my hope. Dom is my hope. Angel is my hope. They are my hope because like them, i am broken and like me, they cope.  \"I feared death when all along I should have feared life\" That sentence is Kami in a nutshell.  \"Life may not be pretty, but it's always beautiful.\" That's just a little tiny sliver of the hope Blaine gives <3.  \"Life happens. This is life, Blaine. And I don't care what you say. That shit isn't always beautiful. It's ugly. And hurtful. And abusive.\"  Thank you, SL Jennings, for giving us a beautifully written and amazing read. Thank you for stepping out of your comfort zone and delivering this beautiful story.

I\u2019m never letting you go, Kami.\u201dFear of Falling is enchanting, seat gripping novel that is unquestionably stunning and heart breaking. Once again I was blown away by SL Jennings and her undeniably fierce style of writing and outstanding story that is like no other I have ever read. I feel like every piece of my heart was torn from my breast and stumped on only to be sewn together afterwards. It\u2019s like the last long gone puzzle who finds it right place. There is nothing better in reading that being enchanted and mesmerized by a story which becomes so close to you and your heart that you feel it pulsating in your veins. Loving equally the idea, characters and writing is a miracle and the best gift reader can ever receive. I can honestly say that I was honored to read and review fabulous, spectacular novel that will captivate hearts of Goodreads users and will rock their world.Fear of Falling is story about broken woman who\u2019s trying to survive. Long ago she gave up on wishing and wanting normal life filled with love and happiness, now she only tries to put one foot in the front of the other and not to crumble. She\u2019s scared of everything. For her hope is gone and love is the greatest enemy.  This. Is. Me. My situation isn\u2019t fucked up. I\u2019m fucked up. Completely, irrevocably, fucked up to my core\u201d. But what Kami doesn\u2019t know is the fact that despite her efforts to avoid commitment love will always find her. Now fighting with her gruesome past and instant attraction to hot as fuck bartender she\u2019s spiraling down the road she did not want to go. Blaine Jacobs is tattooed and pierced man who attempts to get his shit together and live. But when he shares a sensual body shot with Kami he can\u2019t stop thinking about that sexy woman who have alternated him in a strange way. Now he has a new aim \u2013 he wants to make her his.  \u201cI never give up on things I want. This\u2026 you and me\u2026 it\u2019s inevitable. There\u2019s no use in fighting, Kami. It\u2019s going to happen. And when you are madly in love with me, the only thing you\u2019ll regert is not falling for me sooner.\u201dI loved how Kami and Blaine\u2019s relationship progressed. It is raw, painful and full of distrust, but with time is slowly alternating in something beautiful but still very fragile. Sexual tension between the two of them is always present and mind blowing. I adored every steamy scene.This novel opened up me in new ways. I enjoyed it immensely. This romance story spell bounded me like no other ever has. Fear of Falling is pure perfection which blends nicely sensual eroticism, heartbreaking love story with psychological portrait of damaged and abused young woman."}, {"userName": "Kelli C ~ Jack Sawyer's Heart", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14931216-kelli-c-jack-sawyer-s-heart", "userReview": "4.25 Stars! ..just remember, the storm doesn't last forever. It can scare you; it can shake you to your core. But it never lasts. The rain subsides, the thunder dies, and the winds calm to a soft whisper. And that moment after the storm clouds pass, when all is silent and still, you find peace. Quiet, gentle peace.\u201dOh but what a storm Kami has to endure to find that gentle peace. This one of those stories where not much is beautiful. It is broken from the first words read and while the fragments may get put back together, the cracks are permanent.Fear of Falling is such a perfect title for this read, even the love story that develops. Kami is beautiful woman who basically exists in body but lacks true soul. She has endured the most ugly of abuses and her life is dominated by FEAR. Whether irrational or not, she is consumed with the dark and lives in a world where LOVE is not able to be given or received.It was completely unexpected that a tattoo'd/pierced mountain of a man with hooded lust in his eyes would be the catch in Kami's life when she finally fell. Blaine is everything good about a book boyfriend. He is the epitome of goodness for Kami and her world of barren emotion. \u201cYou can't expect to save someone that doesn't want to be saved.\u201dThis read was so emotionally awesome. The feels were everywhere from overwhelming sadness and dread to beautifully open hope found in the arms of a man who is not only a giver, but a taker. That is not a bad taking...it is Blaine holding onto a woman he sees and wants and taking her fears and making them his own.I got you, baby. I got you, and I\u2019m not letting go. You\u2019re safe. I\u2019m never letting you go, Kami.The journey is not smooth. The relationship is not easy. Kami and Blaine are captivating enough but with Dom and Angel, key supporting characters, the story is even more riveting. If you are a lover of angst and not afraid to wade through the darkness to find that beauty can come from pain, then this read will blow you away. Look past the horror and the staggering abuse and see what it is about...the promise of better!"}, {"userName": "Bookhooking (Tanya Childress)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4940504-bookhooking-tanya-childress", "userReview": "Wow, S L Jennings has left me utterly speechless with this one! I don't care if you can only rate a book five stars. I personally give Fear of Falling 10 Big, Bright, Beautiful Blaine Jacobs Firefly Stars!!I fell in love with him, hook, line and sinker. I fell in love with this story in it's entirety, the characters, the emotional parts, the devastating parts, all of it and yes, I cried like a damn baby for the last 20% of it. Should this scare you? Hell Fucking No, unless you don't have a passion to feel and read!! It was worth every single, emotional, tear that slid down my face, every breath I held and every gasp I made for Kami and Blaine!I won't give spoilers in my review, as I never do, but if you have a hard time reading about abuse whether it be physical or otherwise then take caution when buying/reading Fear of Falling. As we all know, this is a very tough subject but at the same time a very, very real one and unfortunately happens more often than we care to think about.Ms. Jennings did a phenomenal job writing this story and per chatting with her, she took a chance writing it. I am sure some may not like it or parts of it but to each their own. I have said it once and I will never tire of saying it. I fucking loved it! It is emotional, heart wrenching, beautiful, exceptional, sad, realistic, gripping, breath taking, overwhelming, okay that is about all the adjectives I can think of right now lol so I will move on to the story.Kami is a beautiful, broken 23 year old woman who suffered immensely, as a child, at the hands of her father, literally speaking, as well as emotionally. Her mother suffered as well but in turn didn't do anything to help her daughter or their situation! Can you imagine? The two most important people in your life, that are supposed to care, love and nurture you, don't!Naturally Kami aka (Kam) believes she is fucked up, broken, unlovable, crazy and has more issues and baggage than any one person can handle. She struggles every single fucking day and I wanted to wrap my arms around her, kill her father and scream at her mother!!I feared death when all along I should have feared lifeWhy couldn't I be normal for on damn dayThese were her thoughts daily.We soon meet Kami's two wonderful roommates, Dom, who is also a victim of abuse and Angel, a woman who was paid by her own family to stay away because they could not accept her choices in life nor her lifestyle. These three are their own family and while it may be weird to others, the way that they treat one another, it is how they cope with every day life and more importantly are there for one another until of course, Kami encounters Blaine.With a look that screams bad boy, but we all know looks can be deceiving, and underneath his gorgeous body and awesome tattoos is a man I think we would all love and want in our lives. Blaine is sexy, funny sweet, romantic and has a heart of pure fucking GOLD!!They first meet in a bar where Blaine is a bartender and their heated encounter sets Kami's world on fire and afterwards, her thoughts of him, never-ending.My body's response to his scared the living daylights out of meHe had the eyes of a man that had seen things. Eyes that were soulful and wise yet vibrant and sultry. Eyes that made me want to run away, yet urged me to stay.A few weeks later, Kami soon finds herself returning to that very same bar in need of a job and from there on more sparks fly and try as they might to keep a working relationship strictly that, the resistance is soon broken and they take things further. They both find themselves enjoying everything about one another. The only problem, the way Kami feels and thinks. While none of what has happened to her in her past, her fault, she believes everything she shouldn't.There were no flowers and hearts in my world. I didn't even know they existedDom and Angel are there for her and she feels closest to them. Dom was awesome, especially considering what he has been through as well. He talks to her, comforts her and basically knows what to say.\"Your fears are not you. Do you hear me? They don't define who you are.\"We can't let them win. If we let them control us now after we've come so far, what else would we have left?\"Kami is scared for different reason, although she feels safe with Blaine and she isn't afraid of him.Blaine soon learns about some of Kami's fears and demons but that doesn't stop this beautiful man, who has been through some things in his life as well, from falling in love with her, wanting to be with her, take care of her, protect her.\"Don't worry,\" he smiled, pulling me into the hard warmth of his chest. I've got you. I'll always catch you when you fall.\" sssssssssswwwwwwwwwwoooooooooonnnnnnnnnnHe was so understanding and quite frankly I have NOTHING bad to say about him, his actions or his character! Kami tried to be honest with him, tell him all of the things she thought about herself, that she didn't do relationships, she wasn't lovable all that heartbreaking stuff that she so sadly believed, in her mind that is! But did she truly believe it in her heart?\"I know you said you don't feel anything,\" he whispered. \"But can you honestly say that you don't feel this? That this heat, this attraction is all in my head? Don't think about it; just answer. tell me what your heart wants to say and not what your head keeps trying to make you believe.\"Do you want me, baby? Tell me you want me. Tell me you feel this too.\"ummm I'll answer HELL FUCKING YEAH!Needless to say you can't deny what's in your heart but with everything that Kami has been through, the constant fear she lives with daily, no happily ever afters, only pain and sorrow and the ugliness she has seen in love. Will all of this continue to haunt her everyday for the rest of her life and push her away from what she needs and wants? Will she be able to hang on to what she feels with and for Blaine? Will he be able to handle all of this and all of her demons? Will she push Blaine away?So many questions but all of those will be answered when you buy this wonderful book on July 18th and devour every single word like I did. If you don't like it for whatever reason I have to be honest with you and say OH MY GOD WHY NOT? because this is in my top reads for this year.Don't even second guess buying this book!! I loved every single emotional, gut wrenching, wonderful, deep, dark, intense and memorable minute of it!!S L Jennings, you rock my dear woman!! Beautiful fucking story!! I am utterly speechless even after this lengthy review ,yet ironically, I could rave and write about it all day long. I could share so many quotes from the story but I WANT YOU TO READ IT FOR YOURSELVES!!I was provided an ARC from the author in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Maja", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13801974-maja", "userReview": "5 Emotional ~ Beautiful ~ Heartbreaking Stars!\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\n\u201cYou don't have to be afraid of falling.

We found out just how awful life could really be. We found out that monsters were, indeed, real. They walked among us. They looked just like you and me. They came in the form of people we loved and trusted the most. The people whose only job was to love and protect us.\u201d\n - Kami Imagine being physically and sexually abused by the one person in your life that is supposed to give you love, happiness, and protection. It's gut-wrenching to know that any little girl would experience this kind of pain. That was Kami Duvall's reality as a child. She lived in fear of her father, who is a monster, until she was seven years old. He's a drug addict, alcoholic, mentally sick man who beat and tortured his wife and child. They eventually escaped and ran away but Kami never truly ran from the demons in her past. What her father did to her scarred her emotionally and broke her mentally. Being inside Kami's heads was heart-wrenching and almost maddening. She fears life. She fears love. She fears everything. She doesn't know what to do with the fear that consumes her. She can't let go of the past that has come to define who she is. The only people she trusts are her two best friends, Dominic and Angel, who are just as broken as she is. They're a dysfunctional family together. They're all she has until the day she meets Blaine.The moment Blaine and Kami meet, something inside her shifts and changes. She feels an electrifying, magnetic pull to Blaine. No man has ever made her feel that much. She fights what she feels towards Blaine but, no matter how hard she fights the attraction, she finds herself spiraling down a path that leads to love and commitment. Is she strong enough to love him? Will she let him love her? Or will she let the fear that consumes her cause her to push him away?This book is emotionally heavy and exhausting. Phew. It took me a while to come out of my own head when I finished it. I instantly fell in love with Kami and Blaine's story from the moment Kami walked into Blaine's bar, Dive, where she eventually gets a job as a bartender. As they work side by side, the attraction between them grows more intense. It's up to Kami to let herself be free from her pain and worries and give in to Blaine, who wants her. Bad. But even with the 'meant-to-be together' chemistry they have, I knew their story would be a bumpy road. And it sure as hell was.\n\"Don't worry,\" he smiled, pulling me into the hard warmth of his chest. \"I've got you. I'll always catch you when you fall.\"\n -BlaineI think you will fall in love with Blaine immediately like I did. He is incredibly patient, sweet, charming, and oh, so very sexy with his tattoos and piercing. Yum. The best part about him is that he is genuinely a really good guy. He treated Kami with the utmost respect. He took his time with her and never rushed her into anything. His sensual whispers and touches made my heart flitter. But even with all his sexy flirting, he knew Kami needed to be treated with care. So he took his time and was extremely understanding of Kami and all of her flaws, especially when they started to rear their ugly head with her mental breakdowns. He never freaked out and ran. He stayed. He wanted her. Scars and all. I give the man credit for putting up with Kami the way he did. She is not an easy person to handle. She would push him away and he would keep coming back. I'm not sure many guys would be that resilient to Kami's wishy-washiness and freak out moments. But, like I said, he's patient and kind.Both Kami and Blaine have broken pasts that cripple them emotionally. Blaine knows all about pain and suffering when he lost his mother at a young age. He knows that in order to gain Kami's trust and to get her to open up to him, he needs to tell her about his past. It's hard for him to open up to her but when she consoles him and listens to him, it's like a salve to his heart. And by him opening up to Kami, she starts to slowly open up to him as well. These two need each other. They need each other to heal. They need each other like they both need air to breathe - which is why I thought this love story was so beautiful. I really love how the relationship builds slowly. The sexual tension between these two kept ratcheting up more and more as the story progresses. I love how they become friends first. Blaine wanted Kami to trust him and he makes sure she does before they take that inevitable step into the bedroom. And when it was time for them to give into that kind of intimacy, it was definitely hot. So worth the wait. This is a heartbreaking doozy of a story about a young woman who has been psychologically damaged and abused. Such a horrid topic that needs to be addressed more often. Miz Jennings does not gloss over the horrific events that happen to Kami. And prepare yourself to lose your breath in the last 15% of the story. I definitely recommend this story to anyone who enjoys reading real-life, unforgettable love stories that will evoke a massive amount of emotions from your heart.P.S. There is angst. Lots of lots of angst is in this story. I just thought the reader should know. P.P.S. Grab the tissues too.

You can't take it down with a hollow-point bullet. You can't pass a sword through its deeply-guarded heart. It lurks in the shape of 253 stars. Kami's 253 fears.How does she fight fear when she's erected her entire life around it? Normally, I'd balk at heroine who is crippled by nothing more than herself, and scream at her to power through it. But Kami's fear is so palpable and vetted, to behave with an iron spine and swinging fists would've belied her character. Jennings is so convincing in the characterization of this poor girl, I was a glutton to experience every detail of her miserable psyche.Blaine is the catharsis in this harrowing tale of persistence and triumph. Victims of abuse lick their wounds in a myriad of ways, but the one honest salve is a sturdy shoulder to brace you through the mending. That person or persons, who accepts without question, who lends support from a distance when distance and patience is what is needed. The Avett Brothers' Perfect Space captures the essence of Kami's relationship with Blaine and her roommates:I wanna have friends that I can trust,that love me for the man I've become not the man I was.I wanna have friends that will let me beall alone when being alone is all that I need.The story is executed delicately, yet with a deep-welled power. The writing is seamless. While it's often emotionally frustrating, the best books always are.

Blew. My. MIND. Loved it. Beginning to end and everything in-between. Loved the characters, the story line, the flow \u2013 the sexual tension, the wit, the humor, the connections between the characters. I could go on and on and on cause guess what? I really can\u2019t tell you what I didn\u2019t like about this book. *breathe* So now\u2026I will continue to babble about what I loved.Kamilla Duvall\u2026Kami Kami Kami\u2026oh my sweet, broken, damaged Kami. So much hurt and fear, hidden so well. Almost. She\u2019s a gorgeous, exotic beauty and she broke me down. I shed so many tears for her. I understood her pain but all I could do was hope she would survive it. She doesn\u2019t have a family. The closest thing she has to a family are her two best friends and roommates, Angel Cassidy and Dominic (Dom) Trevino. Angel is a burst of energy and sunshine to help see Kami thru her darkest days, while Dom understands her pain better than anyone ever will. I truly enjoyed their friendship \u2013 it\u2019s unique and special. \u201cYou can do this,\u201d I whispered to the reflection staring back at me. \u201cIt\u2019s ok. You\u2019re ok. It had to be done. You have to keep going. You can do this, Kami Duvall. You will not break. Not today.\u201d Blaine Daniel Jacobs is a pleasant surprise. Perfection wrapped in an unexpected package. What\u2019s there to love about Blaine? He\u2019s got tattoo\u2019s. Do I need to keep going? He\u2019s tall. He\u2019s got chocolate brown eyes, a boyish grin and according to Kami, a great head of hair. Plus his name alone\u2026once again, Kami his the nail on the head -  \u2018Blaine.God, why couldn\u2019t he have been named something less sexy? Like Mortimer? Or Buford? Because for a name like Blaine to be attached to someone as gorgeous as that scary-beautiful man was downright cruel.\u2019 So effing true\u2026great name. From the outside you would never imagine what he is truly capable of. I fell for Blaine instantly and spent every click of my kindle begging Kami to see what I already knew was there.  \u2018It wasn\u2019t Blaine\u2019s physical adornments that scared me. It wasn\u2019t even his intense chocolate brown gaze that made me forget to breathe. It was him. All of him. My body\u2019s response to his scared the living daylights out of me.\u2019 So first of all, this book gave me one of the best first chapters I\u2019ve ever read. In my life. Ever. Hands down. If I hadn\u2019t already been dying to read this book before I read that chapter, then those pages sold me. Specifically the part involving shots. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. That is all. You will know what I mean when you read it. *shivers* It's that memorable. And thus began my devouring of Kami and Blaine\u2019s story. \u2018For the first time in twenty-three years, I felt something. Something other than trepidation when a man touched me. Something more than the sick feeling in the pit of my stomach when I had to shatter another heart because I couldn\u2019t let anyone in. Something so much more than the emptiness that filled my chest when I thought about the normal, happy life that I would never have.Blaine was my more.\u2019 So when I say I devoured it, I really did. In one day mind you. I couldn\u2019t put it down. I didn\u2019t want to put it down. And obviously given the fact that I finished it in one day, I physically couldn\u2019t put it down. Their story is just one that begs to be read. You feel their desire and longing to be together, but at the same time I understand Kami\u2019s reasons for holding back. Both Kami and Blaine are just very compelling and believable characters. I was completely engrossed in them\u2026their lives, their feelings, all of it. To me, they were very real. \u201cI\u2019m not looking through you, Kami,\u201d I said only for her ears. I didn\u2019t need an audience; I just needed her to hear me. \u201cI\u2019m looking into you. I\u2019m standing here, wondering how the hell a girl so beautiful could hold so much sadness in her gorgeous green eyes. And I\u2019m asking myself why I want \u2013 no \u2013 why I need to know what\u2019s made her so sad. And what I can do to take away every ounce of that sadness. I need to know what it will take for you to let me in, so I can do just that.\u201d The book is told from both Kami and Blaine\u2019s POV\u2019s\u2026which surprised me at first. Not because it was confusing, just unexpected. But trust me, it was a pleasant surprise, because Blaine\u2019s mind is a lovely place to be. I loved getting both their thoughts, both their perspectives on different scenes and encounters. Left no room for questioning \u2013 I like that. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he smiled, pulling me into the hard warmth of his chest. \u201cI\u2019ve got you. I\u2019ll always catch you when you fall.\u201d What else did I like...I liked that I went highlight crazy in this book. Not joking, 20 pages of highlights. Some of them paragraphs because I couldn\u2019t just highlight a few lines, it was all magical, it all had to be highlighted. (Stop looking at me like I\u2019m crazy, I speak the truth!) I liked that this book gave me that feeling in the pit of my stomach. No, I loved that. It\u2019s that feeling that I really only get when I\u2019m reading an angsty book and it\u2019s not giving me what I want. Because I know at the end (hopefully) I will get what I want and that feeling is worth everything. And so much more. Plus that angsty feeling\u2026it builds up adds up for me \u2013 of course I loved Blaine and Kami together but that push and pull just makes me crave that HEA more. Speaking of the HEA\u2026oh\u2026my\u2026GOD. I need to try and come up with a better word, but seriously, I L.O.V.E.D. it. So much. Worth it\u2026and then some. Told you, it's always worth it in the end. \u2018Blaine. All I could see was Blaine. He was the muse for every song, every painting, every dream. He occupied my deepest, most intimate desires, and hindered my past pains from consuming me with his touch.It had always been Blaine. I just wasn\u2019t ready to see it.\u2019 So\u2026as much as I love Kami and Blaine, their story is complete. They will always stay in my heart, but there isn\u2019t much else to tell IMO. But there is Dom and Angel. And oh boy! Do I want their stories??? Yes\u2026yes I do! Very much so. Especially Dom \u2013 I think he\u2019s worse off then Kami was and good Lord that\u2019s sooooo not a good thing. Angel on the other hand would just be a riot. There\u2019s pain there too, but Angel is a blast in a glass and I\u2019m all about her. I cannot recommend Fear of Falling enough, it\u2019s a truly beautiful story about embracing the ability to love."}, {"userName": "Lelyana's Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4110853-lelyana-s-reviews", "userReview": "\u201cI\u2019m telling you that I want you to be mine.

I have plenty for this gem of a book. Let me tell you, I was given the HONOR of beta reading this book and I fell in love with Kami and Blaine from the first page. This story is not a gentle love story. Kami is a very broken person dealing with the horrors of her past. Her story is not one to be taken lightly. But S.L. Jennings, just WOW! She has a way with her words, and those words are woven into a truly beautiful tale of learning to heal and letting go of haunting demons to embark on the adventure of learning in love for the first time. I couldn't be more thrilled and proud of Ms. Jennings for stepping outside of her comfort zone as she brings us Fear of Falling. I don't want to give too much away, but I will say this. Kami is broken (I said this already), Blaine is HOT and AMAZING and WONDERFUL and I LOVE HIM, and together they give you a story that will touch deeply your heart.

It\u2019s letting go and plunging into the unknown. It\u2019s trusting someone with the very most sacred part of your heart. It\u2019s allowing yourself to feel something foreign and uncharted, despite how much it terrifies the hell out of you.\nIt's been a couple days since I finished this book and I still don\u2019t know what to say. I really don\u2019t. One thing for certain is that I loved this book. This wasn\u2019t easy an read; it\u2019s emotional and I have to warn you, there were times where I had to put it down, take deep breaths, and compose myself before continuing. More than just that, I had to constantly remind myself of the heroine\u2019s mindset, otherwise I would've gone crazy. \nThis. Is. Me. My situation isn\u2019t fucked up. I\u2019m fucked up. Completely, irrevocably, fucked up to my core. \nYep. Meet Kami, our heroine. This is her, in a nutshell. I\u2019ve never met any character so set in her ways that it would take a bulldozer, a truck full of dynamite and a loaded cannon just to put a crack her wall. I\u2019m not going to bullshit you, she will try your patience, but then all I had to do was remind myself that she\u2019s extremely damaged and that alone would calm my twitchy palm. I will not go into any specifics, but just know her past is very traumatic. She does not believe in love. To her love brings nothing but pain and misery. The only people she trusts are her roommates, Dominic and Angel, both damaged in their own right. She has a connection to them in which she doesn\u2019t have with anyone else, until she meets Blaine.\nHim. It was all him. Blaine somehow made me forget me. The me that wasn\u2019t allowed to feel all these beautiful, exciting things. The me that didn\u2019t believe in happy endings. The me that was unlovable, and in turn, could never ever love.Blaine was my more.I had finally found my exception.\nOh Blaine -- sweet, wonderfully sexy, tattooed, pierced in all the right places Blaine. Not only does he make me squirm and my heart beat all tachycardic, but there\u2019s so much more to him. So much, that my review will not be able convey how I feel about our Hero. He never gave up on Kami, no matter how hard she tried to push him away. He stood by her, meltdowns and all, and still remained non-judgmental at her side. I just LOVE HIM. \nWhen you know, you know. And you don\u2019t fight it. You don\u2019t deny the inevitable. You free fall because you know there\u2019s someone there to catch you on the other side. \nThere were a lot of little things that stood out for me that made this such a great read. Kami\u2019s roommates are fantastic and I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the first one to say this, but both Angel and Dominic need their own books. In addition, the narcissistic side of me loves the fact that the heroine was Asian (hi, fellow Filipino here **raises hand**). But the main and number one reason why I loved this book was because of all the emotion it evoked in me. It was difficult at times, yes, but Kami and Blaine\u2019s story is so worth the read.

I\u2019ll always catch you when you fall.\u201dAnd just like that, Blaine had staked his claim on the untouched part of me that no living soul had ever moved. He had captured every fear, every reservation, and crushed them in the palm of his inked hand.I can\u2019t remember the last time I felt completely safe. Security seemed more like a luxury to me, reserved for those who were fortunate enough to have picture perfect childhoods. For those who didn\u2019t bear the ugly scars that keep me bound in constant, debilitating fear. I\u2019ve run from that fear my entire life. But when I met him, for once, I couldn\u2019t run anymore.He scared the hell out of me in a way that excited every fiber of my being. It wasn\u2019t the tattoos or the piercings. It wasn\u2019t the warmth that seemed to radiate from his frame and blanket me whenever he was near. It was just\u2026him. The scary beautiful man that threatened to alter 23 years of routine and rituals, and make me face my crippling fear.My name is Kami and I am constantly afraid. And the thing that scares me the most is the very thing I want.I received a copy of this book as an ARC (directly from the author, I believe, though I signed up for it through another blog which I can't remember which it was), so I am writing an honest review about it. S.L. Jennings, I think, has a real gift for writing. And in this book, which is apparently inspired by true events, Jennings doesn't hold back when divulging every emotion that was coursing through Kami and the reasons behind the emotions.\"Shit happens. I never really understood that saying. Yeah, there were certain situations in life that were shitty, but they were just that; they were life. So it really wasn't the shit in life that was, well, so shitty. It was life itself.\"At 23 years old, Kami is living with her two best friends, Dominic and Angel, all three of whom share the commonality of having experienced pain, rejection, and abuse from those who were supposed to love them. It is what has bonded them and brought them so close together. They could rely on each other and understood the complications that could go along with victims of abuse, and they didn't judge each other for it. Given Kami's past, she is extremely guarded. She never lets herself get too close. To anyone. After an incident one night, Kami finds herself at this hole-in-the-wall bar, Dive, where she first meets Blaine Jacobs. Working as a bartender, he is immediately intrigued by Kami. Not only for her exotic beauty, but because of the mysterious and tough exterior mask that she wears for the world. Blaine can see right through Kami, and it only makes him want to know her more. Kami notices Blaine as well, with his sandy brown, just-fucked hair, tattoos, and, wait, was that a tongue ring? To Kami, Blaine is scary-- beautifully scary. He's sexy with just a hint of bad-boy, but with the amount of baggage she carries, she might as well just kiss any thoughts of Blaine goodbye right here and now. However, after some playful banter and lime wedge from a tequila shot being the only thing keeping Kami's lips from touching Blaine's, she can hardly ignore the fire, ache, and need that she felt toward him. \"This... you and me... it's inevitable. There's no use in fighting, Kami. It's going to happen. And when you are madly in love with me, the only thing you'll regret is not falling sooner.\"Kami has sworn off love for years. After the trauma of her past, how could she ever trust a man or love? Sure, she could handle physical interactions, but as soon as emotions become too heavy, she shuts down and shuts others out. But Blaine is different. Blaine makes her feel carefree and almost forget the burdens she carries with her everyday. Almost. Can Blaine possibly be the one to save Kami from herself, even if she doesn't want to be saved? Her heart wants one thing, while her head is telling her another.\"You don't have to be afraid of falling. Just close your eyes, let go, and know that I'll always be here with arms outstretched, ready to catch you.\"Ok, now I do not know what events in this book are inspired from true events, nor do I have any idea who these events are about. They could be about S.L. Jennings herself, or possibly a friend or someone else she knows. I really have no idea. The abuse described in the book are truly horrific and sad, and I am so sorry if those are the true events that inspired her to write this book. The thought of any of that happening to anyone is terrible. I, fortunately, have never experienced abuse and I truly don't know anyone who has (that I know of), so I really can't imagine what it must be like to live with a past that is described for Kami. I know that everyone deals with trauma differently, and it is not my place to judge how anyone chooses to cope with something like that. I also don't know how someone who has suffered abuse such as described in this book would handle reading the book. Perhaps it would help those who have suffered from it to connect with the book and its character, or perhaps abuse sufferers would be critical of the book. I know that after reading The Fault in Our Stars (AMAZING book, btw), some readers were upset with John Green for writing a book dealing with cancer when (they think) he has not experienced what it is like. I don't know, all I know is that this book could possibly give hope to someone who has been a victim of any kind of abuse. Moving on. I was initially very intrigued by Kami. She seemed very mysterious and I wasn't sure what her troubled past was. As the details of her abuse started to unfold, I did feel very sorry for her and understood her reservations about getting into a relationship with Blaine (or anyone for that matter). Not only did she fear getting too close to people, but she had other fears that derived from other childhood memories. She is basically afraid of life. She just kind of wants to get by, unnoticed. When she meets Blaine and spends time with him, you can tell immediately that she feels something for him, even if she won't admit it to herself. Blaine really does bring out the best in her. He is kind, and has the patience of Job (as Kami actually says in the book). He knows she has some kind of issues that she is not divulging, but he doesn't let that deter him from her. Blaine is just an all-around good guy with a good heart who has also suffered loss (though nothing like what Kami has been through). I loved Blaine, and I loved him and Kami when they were together.However, my biggest reservation about this book was that I felt like Kami's insecurities and fears were kind of getting to the point of being slightly annoying. I really hope that doesn't make me sound like an insensitive a-hole because I swear I am NOT playing down what anyone might feel if they were Kami. Just as a reader, it kind of got under my skin. Blaine tries so hard to earn Kami's trust and never does anything to make her doubt him, but she constantly is back and forth with how she wants to handle her situation with Blaine. She wants to be with him, then she doesn't, she wants to tell him how she feels, then she freaks out and pushes him away. Over and over again. I just thought there was way too much back and forth with her and I was getting a little impatient with how long it was taking her to make any progress. Additionally, I didn't feel the level of chemistry between Kami and Blaine that I wish I had. I am not sure why, but it just wasn't all there for me. Maybe because I felt like Blaine barely knew Kami before deciding he became so invested. This might be just me, though. I also felt little chemistry between Eva and Gideon in the Crossfire series, and I know that is a series that plenty of people love.Truly, this is just a personal preference as a reader. I do get easily annoyed by characters who are indecisive (funny seeing as I'm a pretty indecisive person), and I just felt Kami was feeling sorry for herself with this constant no-one-could-ever-love-me-with-all-my-baggage stuff. It just went on for a little too long for me, and it wasn't until maybe the last 25% of the book that I felt something big enough happens to get my interest back and care about the characters again. While I did love Blaine, even he wasn't enough in the middle 50% of the book to keep me in an I-cannot-put-this-book-down stage. Is it a bad book? Not at all. There are a lot of emotional elements and I think Jennings is a good writer, but for some reason it just didn't elicit the kind of emotion that other books have elicited from me. However, it is a good story which I enjoyed (just wasn't totally in love with it), filled with lots of heartbreak, but a happy ending. Overall, I give it a 3.5 out of 5 stars. Fear of Falling will be released on July 18.I want to thank S.L. Jennings for providing the ARC of this book. I am grateful to be able to be among the first to get to read Kami's story."}, {"userName": "Lesley", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12463905-lesley", "userReview": "Imagine a sudden paralyzing feeling, gripping you.

All 252 of them, written on origami stars. Kami was dealt a shit life, which in turn caused her to develop neurosis. Kami learned that the monsters in life aren\u2019t hiding in the dark. We learn about her trauma as we watch her fight to not fall from her tiny sliver of safety. Blaine the crazy, fine piece of the male species has the potential to do just that. Should we add another star? 253\u201cI feared death when all along, I should have feared life.\u201dThe sweet heart, bad-boy with a painful history of his own, Blaine is serious about Kami and tries his best to break through the shell that protects Kami. He doesn\u2019t understand her resistance. He notices her quirks and continues to pursue her. Kami pushes back hard when she feels him getting to close. Blaine is patient and he is kind. He is always there for Kami through her unexplained moments, never once judging her or ridiculing her. But will Blaine\u2019s patience win her over or will her neuroticism? Can he prove to her that you can trust? Can he build Kami\u2019s faith back or will the monster come back and kill it?\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be afraid of falling. Just close your eyes, let go, and know that I\u2019ll always be here with arms outstretched ready to catch you. \u201cFear of Falling is a real book with REAL issues. We watch as Kami starts to heal and move on with her life. I enjoyed following Kami\u2019s journey and meeting her wonderful group of friends. But the biggest thing for me was that it\u2019s a book that I related to. I know what a panic attack feels like. I know what it feels like to be the odd man out because no one understands the panic disorder. I felt as though people thought I was crazy, Hell, I thought I was broken. As I grew older, I learned that I wasn\u2019t and that I could learn to deal and even overcome. THAT is why this story is so absolutely beautiful. HOPE. It gives those of you with no hope and baggage, no matter how small or big that you can overcome. It shows you that you can have faith in life and people. Not everyone is a monster but the scary part is finding out and stepping away from safety. I give this book 5 beautiful stars."}, {"userName": "Terri", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12780752-terri", "userReview": "This was a great book. It was very emotional and brought tears to my eyes. A beautiful love story about healing. I love this crazy group of troubled souls. So very touching! The friendship and the bond they share is so very special, especially with Kami and Dom. Blaine is just..well a gem! And who can not like C.J.? Love how it all came together. What a sweet ending!"}], "description": "I can\u2019t remember the last time I felt completely safe. Security seemed more like a luxury to me, reserved for those who were fortunate enough to have picture perfect childhoods. For those who didn\u2019t bear the ugly scars that keep me bound in constant, debilitating fear. I\u2019ve run from that fear my entire life. But when I met him, for once, I couldn\u2019t run anymore.He scared the hell out of me in a way that excited every fiber of my being. It wasn\u2019t the tattoos or the piercings. It wasn\u2019t the warmth that seemed to radiate from his frame and blanket me whenever he was near. It was just\u2026him. The scary beautiful man that threatened to alter 23 years of routine and rituals, and make me face my crippling fear.My name is Kami and I am constantly afraid. And the thing that scares me the most is the very thing I want.\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he smiled, pulling me into the hard warmth of his chest. \u201cI\u2019ve got you. I\u2019ll always catch you when you fall.\u201dAnd just like that, Blaine had staked his claim on the untouched part of me that no living soul had ever moved. He had captured every fear, every reservation, and crushed them in the palm of his inked hand.Author Disclaimer: Abuse is real- verbal, emotional, physical and sexual.
