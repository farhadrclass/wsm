If you are new to the magical world of David Blixt, start with \"Master of Verona\", work your way to \"The Prince's Doom\", and then wait impatiently for the next installment. Because that is my only concern now that I finished--what is there to read now that would equal the intensity of this ride? If you have read the previous three books in the series, what are you waiting for? Get your copy of \"The Prince's Doom\", stop everything you are doing, and read! In short, if you love historical fiction--or if you just love great adventure novels--David Blixt IS The Master."}, {"userName": "C C Cedras", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8992454-c-c-cedras", "userReview": "This latest in David Blixt's Star-Cross'd series (starting with \"Master of Verona\") answers a lot of questions and still manages to raise more and leave enticing cliff hangers for future books in the series.The Prince's Doom continues the blend of rich historical detail and persons from early 14th century Italy and elements and characters from Shakespeare's plays -- the plausible premise being the origins of the feud between the Capulets and Montagues. So the ultimate tragedies in store for many of the fictional characters is foreseeable. With so many prominent historical figures featured -- Dante Alighieri and Cangrande della Scala among them -- the arcs of their lives is also known. It's the weaving together of these two \"realities\" that's so compelling.My favorite main character, Cangrande's illegitimate son and designated heir to become master of Verona, young Cesco has suffered a horrific personal loss and starts off Prince's Doom both charming and aggravating me in the extreme. Still, he\u2019s such a tragic figure, with an unusual amount of self-awareness under the circumstances -- for me -- his wit, brilliance and pathos just overcome all disappointment and exasperation. Oh, it still rides an undercurrent through most of the book \u2026 just when I started feeling more sorry than vexed, he starts taunting and mocking the Church when anyone could see no good would come from that! Jeez.David Blixt writes dialogue full of wit and humor, his action scenes compare with George R. R. Martin's. The sword fights are so thrillingly crafted, with such immediacy, you hear the clash of steel and feel the straining muscles and scraped knuckles. The way Blixt wound up some loose ends, left others dangling and created doubt about some of the revelations was vastly satisfying. So, I can\u2019t wait for \u201cCaptured Colours\u201d.Note to new readers of the series -- these books are not really stand-alone. Best to start with Master of Verona and read them in order."}, {"userName": "Janet Carroll", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18282807-janet-carroll", "userReview": "I have been waiting oh=so impatiently for this book to come out. If I could, I would have stood behind Mr. Blixt with my arms crossed and my foot tapping even though I had doubts that the last in a series of four books would be worth waiting for. Oh, I've been burned before with a final book which not only disappoints but nearly disgusts the reader from ever buying any series again!!! This book does not disappoint in any major wayFirst, the novel follows the threads of the numerous characters many of whom change from protagonist to antagonist right in front of our eyes. Another reviewer on this site noted that Cesco changed from a darling to a devil and back again so many times readers don't know whether to encourage him or boo him. Villains become friends and friends villains. The ability to portray characters in such a way is daunting'Third, the plot and sub-plots are exhausting to keep up with as are the Itaiian surnames. I visualize the author with a giant white board upon which he tracks the characters and their movements and allies. Many secrets are revealed and many others are implied. Ideas are obliquely referred to andd the stars are referenced many times by the two one-eyed seers (why make both of them lose an eye anyway?)My one small itsy-bitsy criticism is probably not noticeable to most of the general readership, but there seem yo be some word omissions and usage problems. As a 30-year retired English teacher, these are glaring.Truth is truth. In your face."}, {"userName": "Vicki Kondelik", "userReviewDate": "Dec 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16972900-vicki-kondelik", "userReview": "The Prince's Doom is the fourth novel in David Blixt's wonderful Star-Cross'd series set in 14th century Verona. Pietro Alaghieri, son of Dante, tries to protect his foster-son, the brilliant young Cesco, heir to Verona's ruler Cangrande della Scala, against his enemies at court. Full of intrigues and action, the series combines historical events with Shakespeare's characters. It's a great retelling of the events behind the feud in Romeo and Juliet, and it also includes characters from several of Shakespeare's other plays, including The Merchant of Venice, The Taming of the Shrew, Much Ado About Nothing, and The Two Gentlemen of Verona. At over 700 pages, The Prince's Doom is a long book, but don't let that stop you. Once you start reading it, you won't want to put it down. Each volume in the series stands on its own, but I highly recommend starting with the first volume, The Master of Verona."}, {"userName": "Aurora", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5726598-aurora", "userReview": "http://sveta-randomblog.blogspot.com/..."}, {"userName": "Indiebrag", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9273166-indiebrag", "userReview": "We are proud to announce that THE PRINCE'S DOOM by David Blixt is a B.R.A.G.

I thought Cesco's antics were OTT and the ending left me flat. After all the adventures and build up to who was the Greyhound and the excellent development of the main characters, the ending seemed rushed. A big plus point though is a new set of adventures looks in the offing and I look forward to that. If you like historical fiction, this series is definitely worth a read."}, {"userName": "Jenny", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4791512-jenny", "userReview": "Yay for Spring Break! It allowed me to stay up late and zip through this exciting 700+ page book. Now I\u2019m jonesing for a release date on the next one - if you like historical fiction this series is a great read!

What the hell was that really neccessary? And then he runs back to grab not-his-sister-actually but she died in childbirth i just augh. This book was a roller coaster. Now the series is taking us away from Verona? When are we going to start the Romeo and Giulietta tragedy? And honestly i really want more of tybalt he deserves so much better than his shitty life. Anyways ill keep up with this series but i hope it still gives us insight on whats going on besides cesco and dettos whatever theyre gonna do now that theyve run away."}, {"userName": "A Holland Reads", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31438346-a-holland-reads", "userReview": "This was a good action packed adventure book but I now wish I would have started with the first book. I am a fan of historical fiction so this was right up my alley. I like how the character change throughout the story. First they are good then they are bad, it will keep you guessing all the way through the book. The author did a good job with his research as the historical aspect of this book was very good. I liked all the detail he put into the story. I can't imagine all the time it took to write this while keeping all the characters and plot twists in order without getting mixed up. I recommend this book to historical fiction fans as well as suspense fans. But I would start with book one."}, {"userName": "Argum", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5780649-argum", "userReview": "Book 4 in the series or Book 2 Part 3. Many threads close in this entry and new questions emerge. About 2/3 of the way through I was just too depressed about it and what I knew was going to happen I took a long break. I do enjoy Cesco and Detto and am interested to see what happens next. I am also not excited because I think it is nothing good in the end game, which is obvious, and also more pain along the way"}], "description": "The explosive fourth novel in the Star-Cross'd series!
