I'm finished with Anne Rice after following her since the first - there's only so much angst you can take before depression sets in. Early Anne Rice novels, the first Lestat books in particular, carried you along in wonderment at a new view of the world, but that wonder has grown stale and stagnant, and lanquid posing while waiting for the next sexual frisson does not, for me anyway, make for interesting reading.Wondering about your place in the world is all very well, but most of us grow out of it in our teens. Maybe that's why these Vampires do little more than gaze at their own navels - they are emotionally stunted. Too much new-gothic lounging and not enough plot."}, {"userName": "Terry", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8519572-terry", "userReview": "Tiresome so far.

Interview with the Vampire, Rice's debut novel and at the same time the first novel in the now two-digit numbered Chronicles of the vampires series, was published in 1976, but written in 1973, following the tragic passing away of Rice's young daughter Michele of leukemia in 1972. It has since then gone on to become an international bestseller and literary classic even outside of its genre, as well as being an integral part in founding a new understanding of the vampire myth. It's largely regarded as Rice's magnum opus and though it's not my favourite novel of hers (that would be The Vampire Armand due to an excessive case of nostalgia), I agree that it is her best. This is partly due to how tightly Interview is tied to Rice's personal life and how genuine all of what it presents therefore is.Rice suffered from depression after the traumatic death of her daughter and turned to rewriting an old short story of hers. Interview is clearly very much rooted in Rice's own emotional situation, with poor Claudia, the little girl that was never going to live, and the emotional rift and absence of mutual understanding between her parents, Louis and Lestat, with Louis feeling perpetually resentful and wary to the point of incomprehension of his sire. This is of course a direct connection to the reality of Anne and Stan Rice's marital situation and a common occurence in a couple who lost their child. Rice has admitted to her husband being the inspiration behind Lestat and the picture Interview paints of him is not a very fond one. Lestat is in a way the villain of the majority of Interview.Fast-forward several years, to 1985 and the publication in the second book of the Chronicles, The Vampire Lestat. As one might gleam from the title, it is Lestat's turn to tell his tale now and boy do the contradictions pile up. Lestat/Rice excuses most of his behaviour in Interview by either giving background information that undermines Louis' impressions or flat out denying certain events even happened. Lestat developes into the lovable, fun, childish little rascal we all know and love\u2122 and that he would continue to portray in the following books.Audible and overly dramatic sigh here.See, this right here is one of the central problems of the Chronicles and the reason reading half of it \npisses the shit out of me\n. Rice relies here on the principle of the unreliable narrator which, you know? Fine. I'm not opposed to Louis maybe getting some things wrong and of course there is always the fact that different viewpoints will inevitably end up with different conclusions. The problem is just how much she takes advantage of it. The Vampire Lestat absolves the titular character of basically every single thing and it's fucking cheap. Interview loses at least half of its impact knowing the contants of Lestat. Anne and Stan Rice ended up being married for 41 years, right up to Stan's death, so things between them had obviously improved after Interview, especially with the birth of their son Christopher in 1978. Lestat was written by a much happier Anne Rice than Interview was. And that is of course wonderful and I am genuinely happy for them. However, it also means that Lestat, being based on Stan as mentioned, underwent a huge and very much canon-breaking change of character in what kind of reads like Rice retroactively apologizing to her husband for the less than fond portrayal in Interview.The problem with this is a simple fact - Lestat, despite being based on him, is not Stan Rice. He is a fictional creation, bound to an established world and character and the fact that the Rice's marriage was improving does not mean that what Anne Rice wrote in Interview is somehow less valid. Despite it being a key factor to Interview's overall success, reality robbed Lestat and the character in itself in the following books of authenticity. Which is why I kind of really dislike the character now lol.Okay, so what exactly does this have to do with Vittorio, a book centering around a vampire that has never interacted with the main cast? Look up. See those four stars? Yes, I actually really enjoyed Vittorio, despite it being seemingly mostly despised by other people. Why? Well, I actually truly believe Rice has a great talent for portraying the desperation of being and provoking thought and Vittorio is a great example for this. Vittorio is the only vampire in the entirety of the Chronicles that I can think of who actually has time to struggle with the idea of what it means to become immortal, to have knowledge of your impending rebirth and to have that pain be inflicted by someone he loved, protected, trusted (except for David but we never get his perspective on things and he gets over it in like a second) and when he knows he's done for he fucking despises it. I liked Vittorio as a character. He's brash, fervent, entirely believable as a teenager and not actually very smart. I also like that 95 % of this book chronicles the last week of his human life, mostly taking up by him thinking about revenge and exacting said revenge against the vampires who killed his family. It's different, fresh. We don't actually see anything of his 500 years of being a vampire because his humanity is so much more important to him. In a way Vittorio is not actually about vampires at all, rather the radiance of human life (haha, get it? If not read the book).Vittorio ends up with both the girl and immortality and he is miserable. The book ends like this. And Vittorio actually lets Ursula survive, stays with her and is still with her in the present, a fact I found remarkably surprising because the book had me so convinced he was going to kill her. Their companionship is also probably one of if not the most longlasting in the entire series? Again, Vittorio breaks out of by now well known patterns of the Chronicles.All of this would not have worked as well had the character of Ursula not been as compelling as she turned out to be and therefore Vittorio falling for her not been as convincing. The central axis of the tale hinges upon the one scene where he can't bring himself to kill her defenseless self because of his firm belief in the existence of her soul (he turns out to be right) and it is this so altruistic belief which initiates his ultimate fall. Real kudos to Rice here because she managed to get me very invested in Ursula's plight, despite the minimal amount of screentime she has. Especially fascinating to follow was the process of her unravelling, going from the initial fearsome and highly erotic monster to her reveal as a basically clue- and helpless 200-year-old little girl. Even when human Vittorio turns out to be the dominant part of the couple. The power play aspect of their relationship makes it one of the more remarkable of the series.There is of course stuff that I wasn't too fond of as well, such as the cardboard cutout characters of the other vampires and the weird pseudo-rape somehere near the beginning of the book as well as the ever popular 'Hey, you have never heard of me but I totally exist and I'm super powerful too lol!' (you gotta ask yourself just how many vampires Akasha just simply forgot), but these ultimately did not impact my enjoyment of the book very much. The subject of faith and heavenly beings is also handled a lot better than in the \ngod awful\n Memnoch the Devil because it is less of a 'Surprise! The Devil and God are real and Lestat was at the Crucifixion of Christ!' punch in the stomach and more of a quiet introduction of a concept that you also have the choice to write off as Vittorio's hallucinations.Okay to summarize, fuck Lestat's sudden 180\u00b0 change of character and fuck Lestat in general and I like this book because he's not in it."}, {"userName": "Natasha", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2496802-natasha", "userReview": "Vittorio: The Vampire is the second novel in the New Tales of the Vampires series by the legendary Anne Rice. Honestly, I first read this novel a few years ago, but I fell in love with this story so much that I had to read it again. I've read some love and some hate reviews on this novel and honestly, I don't see why their would be any hate. Sure, everyone's opinions are welcome, but I personally think this novel turned me into a vampire lover. Yes, I know many will say, \"Not her Vampire Chronicles novels?? Come on!\" Well, I admit, her Vampire Chronicles are fantastic and they truly are the heart of vampires. Although, I read Interview with the Vampire/Queen of the Damned much to young to appreciate it's greatness. Yes, I loved them, but what made me beg for more vampires and horror was Vittorio. I got this novel on a whim from my friend and boy am I glad he lent me this novel. Who knows how long it would have taken me to get into the amazing novels I so in love with now. Anyway, onto my thoughts on this novel. I truly believe there are many novels you can fall in love with. The characters, storyline and especially, the world that is created. I have so many novels I love for so many reasons, but honestly, I remember everything about this novel. The spot I read it, which was my bed and on the couch. (Take it in mind this was over 5 years ago) I remember being entranced in the world Anne Rice has created. Vittorio's pain was my pain, his joy was my joy and his interest was my own. Anne, as always describes this world in detail. I feel as if I'm right there next to Vittorio. Battling with him, crying with him and feeling the seduction he feels. It's truly a beautifully written novel.This is one of those novels I know I'll read for a third, or many even a fourth time, just to get involved in this world again. I really am disappointed there wasn't more novels in this series, but since I haven't read the first, I think I'll go back to finally read it. Why haven't I read it if I loev this one so much, you might ask? honestly, I loved this one so much, I don't want to be disappointed. I don't believe it will be a bad book, none of her vampire novels I've read are even close to being disappointing. I just love Vittorio so much, he's always going to be \"my first\". Everyone has their first. Who's yours???"}, {"userName": "Alex Reborn", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10931679-alex-reborn", "userReview": "The truth is that I really wanted to finish with all the Chronicles and \"Vittorio\" managed to convince me that I am right by doing just that. I barely managed to get through the entire book and very often I wanted to put it aside, and only my persistence kept me going. I think I got tired of the writing style, with the same descriptions and lack of engaging action. The mixing of the vampires and angels is a bit peculiar, for some it all falls in the supernatural category, but for me is a bad mixture for this kind of book. It shows too much about the author, the questioning about religion, good and evil, angels, and I was left with the feeling that vampires were just stuffed in the tale. However, this time just didn't work for me and I'd rather keep the distance from now on. Moreover, there was some eroticism involved in the story which seemed awkward and wrong. Vittorio was really annoying, he kept talking and was quite slow in understanding the circumstances. Another thing I disliked was the fact that he just couldn't decide if he was fascinated by the vampires or if he considered them demons, if he was attracted or repugnant by them. I comprehend the compulsion, the feeling that you can't stop staring, but this was ridiculous. In my opinion, the story didn't really have a solid frame and by the end it just fell off."}, {"userName": "Mai Gharieb", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14856641-mai-gharieb", "userReview": "If there was a half a star I would have given it to that silly boring book!

It's different from the previous novel, Pandora. This novel has entirely original characters. Whereas Paganism played an important role in Pandora, Christianity is the focus in this novel.And I think that's the part of the novel that shines. By this time in the series, the vampire thing is kind of old. I still enjoy the vampire aspect, but I found the angels in this book to be a refreshing and a complimentary addition to the \"Anne Rice\" take on vampires.Like all of Rice's novels, history and art are important to the story. This novel features the work of Fra Filippo Lippi, an artist during the time of Cosimo de' Medici, as well as the writings of Thomas Aquinas and St. Augustine. All of it flows effortlessly through the story, enriching the experience just as I've come to expect from a Rice novel.The novel is short (My hardcover was 288 pages) and it's a quick read (took me two days), but it's worth it. I think it's best to view this story on it's own. It's completely different from the other vampire books. I didn't find it to be better or worse - only different.

OKAY to me that is just weird, you fell in love with the same person who had slaughtered your family, yeah rather hard to believe, well it is for me anyway. Anne Rice obviously did her research for the book dating it back to Florence in the 1400's. The book itself was lacking in plot, and foreshadowing, probably a few other things as well.

But I think Anne Rice meant for it to be that way; seems she just wanted to get out of her comfort zone.My biggest problem with this story was the repetition of each of her vampires: why do they all have to come from wealthy, if not royal, backgrounds? No beautiful homeless youths for an older vampire to fall in love with? And secondly, why do they all have to reflect her Roman Catholic views (even the pre-Christian vampires, to some extent)? You're telling me none of the vampires can be Lutheran or something?

Even though he's similar, on some points, to Louis (from Interview with a Vampire), he has a much more warrior-like disposition, because, unlike Louis, Vittorio was born during the Italian Renaissance period, being educated as a knight, to protect his land.The story starts telling about Vittorio's life and his family, who owns some land in Italy, in which several families live, protected by Vittorio's father.Some vampires show up and propose that they handle to them the children, old and sick, people no one would miss, to them, but Vittorio's father refuses and that causes the death of all his family except, of course, our main character, whose life is saved by Ursula, a beautiful and seductive vampire.That's when the hunt starts: Vittorio wants revenge for his family, because their deaths made him shocked and unsettled, but, at the same time, starts Ursula's hunt to Vittorio, who, obviously, saved him for a reason.Well, I'm not telling the whole story here. Of course we know that Vittorio becomes a vampire or that wouldn't be the title of the book (at least in Brazil that's the title), but what I liked, specially, was that we didn't know WHEN it was going to happen! Each moment, each part of the story, we are caught wondering \"is it now?\".There are beautiful parts, conversations with angels, beautiful descriptions of the paintings Vittorio loves so much, of the Rubi Graarl Court (hopefully the English name is the same), of Ursula. But also there are parts extremelly irritating, where we think \"STOP, DON'T DO THAT\", because we know exactly what's going to happen - even though he doesn't see it.Do not expect a \"Twilight\" love: Vittorio and Ursula love eachother on a passionate, physical, sad, full of guilt way, after all, she did help to kill his family. After Vittorio is changed, he, unlike Louis menioned above, understands his new situation and accepts it - it's irremediable, and his love for Ursula keeps him alive.It's a wonderful book, exciting and different from most vampire books you've read, that talks about love and hate, of how close they can be and how can someone be, at the same time, full of hate and completelly good, innocent and benevolent.After \"the tale of the Body thief\" I thought Anne Rice had lost it, because Lestat was incredibly boring, sounding more like a dumb Superman and the story was very weak, but with Vittorio, you see clearly it wasn't her, but Lestat that had lost it and me who \"had enough of him\".@http://brazilianbookworm.blogspot.com/"}, {"userName": "Cris", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8094170-cris", "userReview": "Vou confessar, comprei esse livro enganada.

On the one hand, Vittorio is a deep character with enough angst coursing through his body he could put Edward Cullen to shame. Vittorio is angry, lustful, depressed, and confused as he moves throughout the story, and Rice manages to capture that rather well. However, many of the scenes are described rather dreamily. This could be on purpose, as Ursula seduces Vittorio, and we the readers are taken along for the ride. If so, then it is an interesting technique that has a lot to offer. However, given how slow the pace is throughout the story, trying to actually get with the plot is a struggle because of this affect. Furthermore, I think that the novel suffers from the amount of angst Vittorio goes through, especially because of how slow the story can seem at times."}, {"userName": "Sissy Lu {Book Savvy Reviews}", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17779484-sissy-lu-book-savvy-reviews", "userReview": "For me it is always a hit or miss with Anne Rice. This one was a miss. When she was actually writing about the actual story that was relevant I was intrigued, but the way it was written in a rampant fashion that often became sidetracked and the narrator [Vittorio] constantly had to check himself to get back on track, it was distracting and kept me from engaging as well as becoming invested in him and his story. I DNF at 60 mark or so. Too many books on my list to MAKE myself read something!"}, {"userName": "Kathleen ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17830025-kathleen", "userReview": "So I am done with all of Anne Rice\u2019s vampire novels. All twelve. It was kind of hard to keep reading in some spots, like Merrick and Memnoch the Devil, but I managed it. Vittorio\u2026the second of Rice\u2019s New Tales of the Vampires, the spin-off series. Apparently the second and also the last, since she hasn\u2019t touched it since this one in 1999. So this was written right after The Vampire Armand and obviously Rice was going through a Renaissance phase, since Armand took place during the High Renaissance and this is the Early Renaissance. So the artwork the main character happens to love is not as good as in Armand, but whatever. So the entire book is Vittorio\u2019s origin story, like Pandora and most of the Vampire Chronicles. I guess I can see why Rice got bored with this series and stopped writing for a decade. I mean, she was just going through each vampire\u2019s story from the middle to the end of the series, until the last book where she had to tie things up. I didn\u2019t think I would like this book. It was just the last step in my vampiric Rice journey. I was excited for Pandora, which turned out to just be okay and I was dreading this one and didn\u2019t know what to expect. But it was amazing! Vittorio starts off the book by saying there is no connection between him and Lestat\u2019s vampires in the Chronicles. Which was weird for me. I had no idea where it was going.Vittorio is a rich son of a lord and his family is killed when his father pissed off the leader of the local vampire coven. I wish they got more into that, being the first out of my two complaints, though they mentioned it again, but it was too brief for my taste. So Vittorio kind of falls in love with one of his attackers, a girl vampire named Ursula. She lets him go, but the rest of his family is dead. So he swears vengeance and leaves for the town of Santa Maddalana, not really planning it, he just kind of wanders in grief somewhere. So the town is oddly happy and prosperous and Vittorio likes that for a while. But he soon discovers that the town has been offering its \u201cundesirable\u201d occupants to the vampire coven to the north in the mountains. Vittorio hides out in an abandoned castle where he is captured by a vampire who takes him back to their lair. Vittorio actually manages to kill the vampire and Ursula begs for his life and for him to be transformed as well. Vittorio mouths off to the coven leader, Florian, and is sent to live with the captured people about to be drained of blood. Then they drag him to a blood ritual church ceremony when they worship Satan and kill people. Vittorio rejects the offer of the immortal blood and is dumped, poisoned with vampiric blood and kind of crazy, in Florence. He is taken in by an order of monks, but not before he sees three angels, the guardians of the artist he loves, Filippo Lippi. I was completely surprised at this. Rice has never mentioned angels before in her series. This book felt completely different from her other vampire books, though it had a similar message. The angels and Vittorio\u2019s conversations with them were really interesting. It made me want to read Songs of the Seraphim, her newer series about angels. So the angels agree to help Vittorio kill the vampire coven, even though they did not get precise orders from God to do so. Vittorio swears to kill all the vampires, including Ursula. I kind of liked how the vampires wandered the earth forever, wondering if there was a higher power, and that is not really here with Vittorio. Vittorio describes the vampires in Biblical terms, which makes sense because of the time period he comes from. We kind of get \u201cproof\u201d of God, but I didn\u2019t mind it too much because all the angels we met were unique and the dialogue was very well done. So that was my second compliant and neither of those were actually a big deal for me. I loved this book. So Vittorio slays all the vampires during the day with some help from the angels in a gore-fest with lots of detailed imagery. But he cannot slay Ursula and instead waits beside her until she wakes up at nightfall. The angels leave, disgusted that he broke his promise. Ursula then tricks Vittorio into becoming a vampire too, which I think he totally should have seen coming. Together, they kill off all the evil villagers in Santa Maddalana. Vittorio likes living and is too fearful of Hell to destroy himself as he knows he should, so he continues to live in sin with Ursula. They depart for Florence (more food there) and hear the news that Filippo Lippi is in huge trouble because he ran off with a nun the day that his guardian angels went to help Vittorio. They go to Filippo\u2019s house and the angels there are angry at him for not keeping his promise and becoming a murderer. The lead angel curses him with the ability to see the divine spark of Creation in every living being, like an angel, so that when Vittorio kills, he will be haunted by the sight of the spark going out. The angels leave and Vittorio is horrified. This really drives home the theme Rice loves to write about (and I love to read), that the vampires hate killing, but must kill to live, and begin to detest themselves (though some like Marius, justify it by killing the Evil Doer). Vittorio and Ursula return to Vittorio\u2019s castle where he grew up and have been together for five hundred years (finally a vampire couple that actually stays together) and Vittorio is in self-torment. I love this ending! I loved this book! The suspense was great, the action was great, the dialogue (especially the angels). It was all great! This would be an amazing movie too! Though it felt a little disjointed from the tone and feel of the other vampire novels, I really enjoyed this one. It was surprising, heartfelt, poetic, and refreshing. I am so excited to continue reading Rice\u2019s work and am thoroughly impressed. Definitely ended this series on a good note for me and I can\u2019t wait to read The Prince Lestat in October!"}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5892431-sarah", "userReview": "Boring...."}, {"userName": "Hannah Merida", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43625893-hannah-merida", "userReview": "Aagghh no le voy a poner ni una estrellita de lo p\u00e9simo que es, me decepciono, esperaba m\u00e1s de Anne Rice\ud83d\ude12"}, {"userName": "Natasha GJ Nanny Nakia", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13517918-natasha-gj-nanny-nakia", "userReview": "Rese\u00f1ado en mi blog Nanny BooksEsta historia escapar\u00e1 totalmente de la saga de Lestat, para mostrarnos la visi\u00f3n perturbadora de un vampiro doblemente maldecido.He de decir que al comienzo no me enganch\u00f3, principalmente porque no aparec\u00eda Lestat.

I loved the first 2 chapters of this book. It started out pretty nice and strong. It had a great opening paragraph, where Vittorio describes holding his brother and sisters' severed heads in his arms. And I was like, fuck yeah! This is gonna be some good shit. But it wasn't. It really wasn't. Because then it just went nose diving downhill. I hate Anne Rice's tendency to bring in God/the Devil/Angels/Heaven/Hell/Christian mythology into her stories. I never read those kind of stories, I'm not religious and I do. not. give. a. shit. Now, sometimes she touches on those themes in other books but leaves them alone and gets on with a good story. I'm ok with that. But I'm not ok with it when she goes on and on and on about angels. Like, Vittorio, pull yourself together. Drink some blood, live forever. Stop whining. So it hurts me to give this book a 2 star rating when I usually thoroughly enjoy her books.In reality, this is really a 1 star read. I found it incredibly dull and I struggled to make it through. The reason I decided on 2 stars instead of 1 is because Anne Rice is still a beautiful writer, and because I have read and enjoyed so many of her other books. I still have to read the Lives of the Mayfair Witches book so here's hoping she kinda eases up on the religious motifs a bit. And if not....well, it breaks my heart to even consider the implications of 'if not'."}, {"userName": "Joshua", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7810047-joshua", "userReview": "Vittorio the Vampire presents a differing picture of vampires than what Anne has presented with her seminal Vampire Chronicles Series (which I'm slowly working through). The story begins with young Vittorio and his family living in regal elegance in Lordship over the hamlets and farmland of their valley located somewhere in Italy within proximity of Florence. The story quickly escalates taking the reader on a harrowing journey. I don't want to say too much ruining the story, but Vittorio becomes enraptured with a vampire woman, Ursala who he falls madly in love with. Her toothy bite disposing him to unparalleled rapture and ecstasy. It's also a story of faith for young Vittorio grapples with his deep draw and feelings towards a demon and his own Christian faith. The vampires themselves in this novel are of a decidedly Satanic and ritualistic variety. Eventually Vittorio decides he must seek out and destroy these creatures of the night, but has to come to terms with potentially having to destroy Ursala the creature he is so drawn to by \"love.\" Angels come to Vittorio's aide about half way through the novel coming as a complete surprise to me. Basically it's a story of good and evil and the young man coming to terms with the fact that people and life isn't always so black and white.
