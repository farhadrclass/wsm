It's particularly insightful when it comes to the lives of queer women in the collegiate setting, on old school sororities and fraternities, and biases and prejudices both within and without the queer community. The particularly difficult bits were the ones dealing with campus rape culture (which is at least coming to light these days, though, yeah, still a huge thing...) and the twisted perspective that held homosexuality as a disease of the mind. But no one goes into these lesbian pulp novels expecting rainbows and glittery unicorns. Can't have a happy ending--as was the rule back in the day, per the publishers.While it's worth a read for history's sake and the writing does have moments of excellence, the plot is an absolute mess. It doubles back on itself, repeats its own points, and though the conflicts do raise in terms of tension and importance in a vague way, the whole thing falls apart instead of going anywhere in particular. That'd be all right if the character arcs... existed. Mitch and Leda both reach their apex of character development (which isn't saying much) in the middle, but thanks to editorial/publisher directive, Packer was forced to completely undo any progress they'd made.So a difficult read, but an okay one, and interesting for sure."}, {"userName": "Alex", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex", "userReview": "[a girlfriend's mother found a letter she'd written; she was punished.

There she rooms with campus belle Leda Taylor, who one night seduces her -- even though Leda refuses to admit she's a lesbian and stubbornly maintains a guise of bisexuality by continuing to sleep gleelessly with her ghastly frat boyfriend Jake. The two girls succeed in keeping their affair secret for some while, but when they're finally caught in flagrante Leda lies through her pretty little teeth to put all of the blame on Mitch. Luckily the wise old College Dean suspects this may not be the whole truth . . .I became interested in Packer's work because of her pulp crime fiction, so thought I'd give this a try. Despite the horrendous cop-out at the end -- forced (and probably wisely, in that era) on Packer by her editor -- I found the lesbian-novel aspects of the book to be a bit pulpish but nonetheless quite interesting: its elements are, after all, those of many other romance novels, whatever the gender of the participants. On the other hand, I found the descriptions of sorority life in all its infantility, spitefulness and cliquishness so revolting that I almost abandoned the book on occasion; even rape is something to be glossed over if it might embarrass the sorority or harm its relationship with a powerful fraternity. (Toward the end I discovered that Packer's views on sororities were the same as mine, that she'd intended to revolt us!)Packer manages to slip in the occasional subversive line that her editor may not have noticed. For example: \"And Travis King had false teeth, which only made her more beautiful and which she talked about, often, in mixed company.\"Thankfully we've moved on a bit since those days -- or, at least, most of us have -- and at least in developed countries people are generally (though to our shame far from always) able to be open about their sexuality. That said, as an item of historical interest, Spring Fire is certainly well worth reading -- and, as it's fairly short by today's standards, doing so doesn't take too long."}, {"userName": "Lark Benobi", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73768036-lark-benobi", "userReview": "At first I enjoyed the ridiculousness of the prose ( little Leda grew fast and fully and richly. She had long black hair that shone like new coal, round green eyes, a stubborn tilt to her chin, proud pear-shaped breasts that pointed through her size 36 sweater, and long graceful legs.) but soon I just felt abused by the many scenes of women getting date raped with the approval of their sorority sisters. Nothing happens to the rapists, but a woman who confesses to the crime of lesbian feelings gets institutionalized. Ok. I was looking for campy fun, along with a sociologically interesting study of early lesbian fiction, but I discovered that I wasn't up for the grotesque misogyny I found here along with the campy fun and sociologically interesting bits. It's a good measure of the progress our culture has made, though, since the novel was written."}, {"userName": "Nick Guzan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33268531-nick-guzan", "userReview": "More historically significant than it is a satisfying story, though author Marijane Meaker (\"Vin Packer\" herself) unapologetically explains the censorship forces at work in the book's stirring introduction that was added much later: \"We did what we had to do, informed by the times.\"Spring Fire (not her intended title either!) does indeed make for interesting reading as Meaker deftly recreates the world of a typical 1950s co-ed college campus. The censorship-dictated ending is an obvious disappointment, but at least Patricia Highsmith's masterful The Price of Salt exists for a more satisfying story and conclusion."}, {"userName": "Wendy Rouse", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70250177-wendy-rouse", "userReview": "Spring Fire by Vin Packer (Marijane Meaker) is considered the original lesbian pulp novel. Meaker's work reveals the cultural anxiety and curiosity about lesbianism in 1950s-era United States. The story follows Susan \"Mitch\" Mitchell as she begins her freshman year at Cranston University and joins a sorority. She quickly becomes infatuated with the sorority queen, Leda, who likewise falls head-over-heels for Mitch. Reader beware though. Consider the historic context of the era in which it was written - this story has no happily-ever-after, fairy tale ending."}, {"userName": "Hex", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10291201-hex", "userReview": "This was a book I originally read as an assignment for my Queer Lit class in college. This book is a milestone as the first lesbian \"pulp\" novel ever written. It was published in 1952, and the earmarks of the period are all over it, especially in the ending that was forced into it. Spring Fire was published under the name Vin Packer, a pseudonym for Marijane Meaker. The story is somewhat based on an experience that she had in boarding school, where she originally wanted it set, like many of the stories we read or see in movies nowadays. However, here is where the executive meddling started. They demanded the story be moved to college, as boarding school would make the girls seem too young. Thus, it was moved to a sorority. The original title \"Sorority Girl\" was pre-empted in an attempt at confusion marketing, hoping that people that wanted to buy \"The Fires of Spring\" might buy \"Spring Fire\" instead.The story is somewhat familiar to those of us who read a lot of LGBT literature. Mitch is a tomboyish girl who gets into the exclusive Tri Epsilon Sorority at a fictional university through a legacy and promises of alumni gifts. She is drawn to the beautiful, fiercely independent and wild Leda Taylor. They become roommates and Leda draws her into double-dating, which goes horribly, and leads to the sorority being blackballed.Giving into peer pressure, Mitch agrees to go to a fraternity party, where she is raped by the fraternity president. Leda finds her in shock and calms her down by confessing her love for her. The two begin a secret, passionate relationship, despite publicly dating boys. Leda pushes how they must follow men and how they must keep themselves secret, even turning from ignoring to affectionate depending on who if anyone is present (most notably her mother.)And again, we see where the executive meddling changed everything. Here, the writing tenor changes, like the ending was pasted on. In 1952, the ending had to be changed because the post office wouldn't send anything that made homosexuality seem \"normal\" \"healthy\" or \"good.\" So, this happens:Mitch tries to sleep with the boy she's dating, but he can't perform, and Mitch blames herself. She tries to leave the sorority, convinced that Leda is somehow affecting her, or infecting her, but Leda tries to seduce her again. They're caught by the sorority. Leda turns on Mitch and reads a love letter aloud, trying to convince them that Mitch attacked her. Mitch is interrogated by the college, and guilty, Leda falls into a drunken depression. Leda crashed on the way to her interrogation, and is found calling out for Mitch in a drunken, injured, delirious state, and is sent to a hospital. Mitch visits Leda once, leaving her former lover a sobbing mess in a complete breakdown, before heading back to the sorority, where she starts new friendships, realising she never loved Leda at all, and that Leda was mentally ill. It's a good read for the historical view of how things have changed and how much acceptance the LGBT people have today, even if there is much yet to do."}, {"userName": "Amy Rae", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16281793-amy-rae", "userReview": "[breaking Mitch and Leda up, putting Leda into a car crash and then an asylum, and having Mitch convince herself none of it meant anything (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Pamela", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/610712-pamela", "userReview": "Good lord, what a read. I can see how this book would have been disturbing on many levels when it was released in 1952, because it still carries quite an impact. College freshman Susan \"Mitch\" Mitchell falls in love with her sorority roommate, the promiscuous Leda Taylor, who uses sex to distract her from her pain. Mitch is sheltered and naive, but smart enough to know when she's being taken advantage of by a fraternity president, and astute enough to realize she's in love with Leda. For all her worldly ways, Leda can't defog herself long enough to know what she wants from her boyfriend (which is to be rid of him), or from Mitch when Leda realizes she's falling in love with her as well.There are some passionate and frightening scenes that still carry quite a bit of power, even to a modern reader. Vin Packer did an admirable job addressing conformity and the expectations of an impossibly perfectionist society in her novel. This version has an introduction written by Packer in 2004 where she explains that she resisted re-issuing this book because she was embarrassed about the ending. Indeed, the ending is so abrupt and unexpected, and unlike the previous entirety of the book, that I liken it to the reader being almost able to see the staples and Scotch tape over where the real ending was supposed to go. However, it's important to note that Packer's editor instructed her to make the resolution unhappy or the US postal service would send the books back to the publisher. This book will push and hurt you, but don't put it down, and don't dismiss it. It's worth your attention. If you're sharp enough, you can learn from the characters and their trials. One of the most disturbing aspects of the book may be realizing how much of Packer's world in 1952 isn't too different from ours."}, {"userName": "Mel", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5866692-mel", "userReview": "Originaly published in 1951 and captioned as the first lesbian pulp. The introduction of this book by the author comes out as an apology. In it she quotes a conversation she has with her publisher about how she wants to write a story about her experiences at boarding school, he tells her she can write the book as long as it's set in college, not school, and that it's very clear in everyone's minds that Lesbian is a BAD THING, and that there is no happy endings. Despite this the book still sold 1.5 million initially, much better than the estimated 400,000. The book is quite terrifying. I think I much prefer Radclyff Hall. But I think that's because 50s sorority girls might be everything I despise most. The book describes the young (butch) girl joining the sorority, they don't think much of her looks but because her dad's a millionaire they decide to let her in anyway. She quickly falls in love with the house queen, who it turns out is also gay but hides it by sleeping with her boyfriend. There are some really horrible parts to read in here, from the required date rape the pledges go through, to the attitudes towards sex, the veiled references to sexual abuse and the breakdown of the main character. All told though the writing style is not as open or as honest as Ann Brannon. I felt sorry for the characters living in that hell and I found it quite moving. I ended up feeling very sorry for the sorority queen, or anyone stuck in that lifestyle and culture. She should have moved to Greenwich and hung out with the other lesbians and the beats."}, {"userName": "Caitlin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/281756-caitlin", "userReview": "This book gives the reader an interesting glimpse into a life that was strictly forbidden at the time of publication, and the picture painted is very fascinating and controversial.

I'll write here about the former's Spring Fire and the latter's Odd Girl Out together, and post my comments on the pages for both books. The two are strikingly similar; Bannon has of course acknowledged her debt to Packer but even knowing that had not prepared me for the identical match of setting and characterization of the principals: the sorority house; the popular, beautiful, mercurial senior with anger issues; the innocent bumpkin of a pledge who happens to be her roommate, and in whom she sparks feelings the poor girl struggles to understand and yet cannot resist. Both authors were constricted by their times, by popular mores and more practically by federal obscenity laws, and at the same time encouraged by editors to skirt the lines drawn by these constraints as closely as possible.If only they had been encouraged to write better. Some people find these books don't age well because of their terrible endings, in which young lesbians either generally either go completely insane, or are cured by psychiatry or by the love of a good, strong man. I find the weak prose far more objectionable than any of that. To be fair, each of these was a first novel for its respective author. And dime-store pulp novels, which is what these were, were not known for their literary quality; indeed that wasn't what their audiences wanted. And yet I know for a fact that both of these authors are capable of much, much better. These books would have had a very different history had they been written with a more literary approach. But I cannot begrudge them the history they did have, which is remarkable. And I cannot begrudge the millions of readers who were touched by them, and who might never had read them if they had been written with more literary craft. They are what they are, and they are interesting in their own right for that."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/215017-michelle", "userReview": "A vividly written novel, though rather badly afflicted by the curses of 1950s lesbian pulps: one lesbian is revealed to be not a lesbian at all, and the \"real\" lesbian ends up in a mental institution.
