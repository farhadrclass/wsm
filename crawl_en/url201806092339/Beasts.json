Our update below 1) raises concerns with the legitimacy and legality of certain PoP-ISL-VISA findings, and 2) represents a troubling breakdown of legal processes established to protect creative writing professors, their artistic and earthy wives, and their natural interest in seducing Lovelorn Lasses and then sharing photographic records of those seductions with various art magazines.The \u201cdossier\u201d compiled by author Joyce Carol Oates detailing REDACTED is one of many such prepared by this individual. After carefully considering the ongoing recurrence of certain themes within her frequently issued reports (e.g. loss of innocence; the manipulation of younger women by older men; female sexuality as an elemental force; the appalling darkness that lies beneath civilized exteriors such as those veneers displayed by certain creative writing professors and their artistic, earthy wives), this majority audience is compelled to note that the author exhibits undue bias in favor of various Lovelorn Lasses and is clearly opposed to their manipulation and seduction by faculty members.UPDATE: All photographic evidence destroyed by blazing fire; a certain faculty member and his wife burned alive."}, {"userName": "Paul Bryant", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant", "userReview": "Last night I went hereto meet a friend, and after a couple of bevvies we went hereand had a good meal - I had a weird rubbery starter followed by PLA SAM ROD ( Boneless crispy fish cooked in exotic tamarind sauce) - most excellent.

A short, hazy, spellbinding story, it quite breathlessly races through a short period of time in the life of its young protagonist, Gillian, an undergraduate at Catamount College, Massachusetts, in the autumn of 1975. Gillian is in love with her professor, Andre Harrow, and fascinated by his sculptress wife, Dorcas. She is obsessed with becoming part of the Harrows' lives and, jealously following rumours that they choose 'special' students to assist with their art, is drawn into their strange and intimate rituals. This is a very brief and highly taut novella which feels like it is meant to be read quickly and then re-read - something I think I'd need to do in order to effect a more in-depth analysis of the plot. It's all about atmosphere, with the weird, hypnotic effect of the Harrows leaping off the page and making you feel part of the narrative even though Gillian remains a somewhat remote character."}, {"userName": "Robert Beveridge", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/766524-robert-beveridge", "userReview": "Joyce Carol Oates, Beasts (Carroll and Graf, 2002)Joyce Carol Oates cannot be human.It is simply impossible for a single human being to turn out the work she has over the course of her career, consistently stratospheric in both quality and quantity. Her thirty-year bibliography is so vast that the major internet repository of Oates research and criticism doesn't have a full list anywhere, but is now a searchable database. Another admittedly incomplete bibliography on the web lists eighty-nine books split between novels, short story collections, and poetry, fifteen anthologies she has edited or co-edited, ten works of non-fiction, and ninety anthologies in which her work has appeared since 1980 (and those are only the horror-themed anthologies). She is the Merzbow of literature, the Sun Ra of wordcraft, both the dream and the nightmare of the bibliophile with a limited reserve of cash. The truly astounding part of all this is that one can walk into a (very well-stocked) bookshop, pick up a Joyce Carol Oates book at random, and have an odds-on chance of being rewarded with one of his finest reads of the year. Now add to this idea the fact that Oates is, for all intents and purposes, a one-trick pony, and explain how one person can write so much material on a single theme and still have it come out so very, very well.Such is certainly the case with her recent novel Beasts. Anyone who's read Oates before, in whatever form, is liable to know a few things about this book even before cracking the cover: the main theme of the book will be human degradation. One of the characters in the book will be horrified by the degradation, even while experiencing it, and this horror will cause the character to commit some sort of extreme and socially unacceptable act. There will be a great deal of uncomfortable eroticism. Then you open the book, read the first two small chapters, and here's something new: Oates is going to tell you all this in the first four pages. It's almost as if she's throwing down the gauntlet to the reader; \"you know it's coming, I know it's coming, let's see how much I can give you at the beginning and still beguile you with my novel.\"And utterly beguiling it is. Gillian Brauer is a student at a small college in Massachusetts who is enamored of one of her professors. She is not alone in this, but the lengths to which she goes in her obsession with him are rather farther than the others go (in one early scene, she surreptitiously follows his wife through town, and mentions she has done this a number of times before). She knows that sometimes the professor and his wife, a sculptor whose most recent show at the school's gallery has ignited a firestorm of outrage, will sometimes allow students into their inner circle, but that these students are very tight-lipped about what goes on there. Secret society stuff at its best. Gillian, too shy to confess her love for her professor and desire to be one of those students, begins to imagine that all of her housemates in the small house/dormitory where they live, are members of the inner circle, and eventually gets to the point where she must either confront her professor or go crazy.And that's the light, optimistic part of the novel. Things get much more fun after the confrontation.This novel is obsessed with small. It is slim--a hundred thirty pages in the hardback edition. Gillian lives in the smallest dorm on campus and is obsessed with gaining entrance into living quarters with even fewer people. Her obsession grows when, after a semester with the professor in a normal-sized lecture class, she is admitted to one of his workshops, with only eleven students. Her classmates grow thinner over time. Small is everywhere. There is a whole (probably longer than the book itself) thesis to be written on small in here. The themes Oates taken on, on the other hand, are not small in the least, as they never are. And, as always, she does so with such style that the reader cannot help be compelled. I didn't finish this book in one sitting only because I had to go to bed last night if I wanted to have a fresh enough mind in the morning to keep involved with the story.Gillian's professor is fond of muttering Nietzsche under his breath at odd times. Funny that Nietzsche's most famous aphorism is never mentioned in the book: \"...and if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.\" Oates has been gazing into this particular abyss for thirty years now, throwing down that gauntlet, challenging it to gaze back, and reporting on what she finds. Perhaps she will continue to do so for another thirty years, and we will continue to get such brilliant books as this. ****\u00bd"}, {"userName": "Branwen Sedai *of the White Ajah*", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5701086-branwen-sedai-of-the-white-ajah", "userReview": "Second Read: (4/2/2016) Just as dark, twisted, and seductive as I remembered it.

The jacket made this sound a bit more like a gothic horror romance than it was. Totally false advertising. Instead, I got a tedious period piece about spoiled college students in love with their wretched abuser of a professor and his sculptress wife. I found it tedious. And more a vehicle for Ms. Oates to show her own academic prowess than a suitable vehicle for storytelling. The crux of the book only takes about 30 of the book's 138 pages; everything else merely builds up to the plot. The characters are dull and drawn poorly, seen only vaguely through the main character's eyes; although, perhaps that is only because she's so obsessed with her professor. He's actually not terribly impressive. All the girls merely suffer from guru syndrome. The climactic ending is silly and overblown and a bit improbable, frankly, speaking as one who used to be a smoker. And I tired of the constant 'beautiful Dominique' descriptions: Because she's secretly a woman of colour, she is bold and dramatic and exotic. And the main character, I swear, is in love with her. But that only serves to set Dominique apart, make her less rounded as a character. So, no. I wasn't into this one.

The characters were adequately developed: Gillian, Andre, and Dorcas made the [un?] holy trinity of main characters. The peripheral, secondary characters seemed heavy handed: Sybil? Marisa? ...They seemed written in as part of another story line that was never quite developed or integrated.It's incidental to me that while the book takes place at a women's college, ostensibly among close friends, each action and behavior seemed totally encapsulated in the individual character. There is little non-superficial interaction between anyone, excite for Gillian's insipid fawning. Maybe that was the point, that each individual is completely isolated from one another ... but were that the intention, I remain even less impressed with this work.I expected the book to fit more into the tradition of being John Fowles-esque, insofar as the character becomes very much a victim of others behaviors. For me, the main problem was that there wasn't enough struggle, there wasn't' enough conflict internalized by the characters."}, {"userName": "Lee Foust", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13984676-lee-foust", "userReview": "This is a very troubling read in a really, really good way. While staying well within the POV of our now older, but generally once needy and naive young undergraduate narrator through her titillating and abusive relationship with a poetry teacher and his French artist sculptor wife, we get a panorama of beastly--non human, non rational, sensual (although perhaps that's too positive a word, but there's really less morality and more actual character study here so...)--behavior, attitudes, and acts. Nicely, artistically, in the great modernist tradition, there's not so much editorial here as raw imagined human experience and we as an audience are invited to sit back and moralize, or not, and in that I feel like Beasts is a very personal read and that each reader will take something wholly different from it--because there's nothing more interior, avoided, and therefore personal than each of our relationships to erotica and the power structures that complicate our every move in that taboo arena.I guess there's the double taboo effect. Many are uncomfortable with erotica (not the literary genre but rather the topic of sexuality, one's relationship with all things sexy) in general because of moral/societal strictures, prudery (me--guilty), or religious doctrine. And those few who remain relatively pure in their relationship to the erotic--that is void of religious or community standards or gross trauma--will probably have pause based on the power structures that cloud sexuality when partners of different ages, experience, genders, marital relationships etc. etc. begin to couple.Sexuality is perhaps the cloudiest of all human enterprises--despite it being, along with food and shelter one of our three natural primary concern in life--because of the societal religious discourses, the taboo on speaking of it among ourselves, and then the inevitability of how social status and power structures are implicit and create another, second level of taboo around the whole thing.Messy, very messy. Beasts is about just how messy. The novel uses fire, a standard metaphor for passion, and art--both poetry and sculpture--as foils for our protagonist's first major experience with pure eroticism. As always, i think, those experiences, coming as they do in adolescences and young adulthood are creepily intertwined with the love that, as human beings, we've only experienced up to that time with and for our parents. This creates that most twisted of situations, the very young person becoming infatuated with the parent stand-in and the power structure so taboo it's become a cultural obsession, a kind of literary displacement of incest that's haunted Gothic as much as ghosts since Walpole's Castle of Otranto.Oates handles all of this really well. it's a swift, engrossing read. My take on messiness? Although it's outside of what the narrator could have known--and perhaps this is the reading in, the personal reaction I warned you about earlier and mine is bound to be very different than yours--speaking as one of those semi-charismatic (at least enthusiastic) literature and creative writing teachers--their reasons for being such beasts (tee-hee, I made a pun!) are exactly the same as the narrator's reasons for becoming infatuated with one of them: we never felt loved by our mothers so we seek the limelight, attention, through writing, performing, teaching, because we too are vulnerable and needy. Is not Andre seeking some kind of mothering from Dorcas? So, it's there, perhaps, in the novel, but subtly portrayed. The final battle here seems to be fought between the two women and one could say that the focal point--poor Prof. Andre--is a pawn in these female weaknesses and strengths. Poor humankind. We are broken, mostly, and my never be healed. it makes for good books. Who here, in the end, is the protagonist and who the antagonist, who the Svengali and who the victim? The question, as usual, is much more important than the answer."}, {"userName": "Alexandra Le Trionnaire", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5360804-alexandra-le-trionnaire", "userReview": "The fascination that philosophy / poetry / literature professors exert on their students has given birth to countless books, out of which I can clearly recollect two, The Dying Animal by Roth and Disgrace by Coetzee. Both worth re-reading (a compared analysis would be worthwhile)Unlike her male colleagues, Oates takes the narrative point of view of the young woman, and this is no small choice. The young silent Gillian alias Philomela, falls deeply in abnegation-love with her poetry professor - a vivid reader of D.H Lawrence's poems. Unlike in other books mentioned above, there is a love triangle with Dorcas, the professor's wife and sculptress. Students are trapped by the Pr H. and served on a platter to the lurid Dorcas for her totem creations. It made me think of the Minotaurus myth - young virgins sent by the King Egee to a labyrinth to appease the hunger of a monster. Yes, there is in these young students the complete surrender of their body in blossom to the immortality of art - comes before the Dyonisiac ritual elements of French feast (cassoulet), binge drinking (red wine), (maybe drugs), and sex. Why not if it is for the sake of art? (I didnt understand why Oates tricks the story with the discovery of porn magazines and other students' pictures by Gillian). What I really liked is Oates 's dark humor. She introduces very comic characters like an old green parrot who bleeds from its own pecking, and is said to have resurrected many times like a phoenix (poor figure of the flaming phoenix though). It echoes the myth of Philomela, a young virgin deflorated by a cousin who cut her tongue - she later was metamorphosed into a blood-breasted bird. Is the old green parrot the sad version of Gillian or is it a student who got metamorphosed?Of course, it all ends tragically by destruction by fire. But this is a very foreseeable, classic ending. Would have expected something more creative.Great book, with a lot of mirrors - I have just noted a few ones.

I see that by other reviews here, it's one of those love it/hate it books. I'm always puzzled by why a book elicits such diverse reactions.With \"Beasts\", I think a lot has to do with the atmosphere of the novel -- an Eastern liberal arts college for women. I have no idea if it depicts this world accurately, having only attended college in a somewhat backward Montana town. This is key. If you can't imagine yourself as the sensitive, shy, poetic narrator awed by the bohemian professor and his wife's earthy, erotic power, you'll find the whole premise false, even annoying. With Oates, I find I have to relax, give her the time to build a convincing voice and world and trust that I will enjoy the book in the end. She is one of those authors that will reward your patience. By the end of this, I had found the way into the main character, her motives had an internal logic, the \"beastly\" parts of the professor, the pretentiously arty wife and the other overly self-involved students made perfect sense.A very worthwhile, short read.

No matter what I read, Humbert Humbert remains one of the most disturbing characters I've ever read...until Andre and Dorcas Harrow in this piece. I think that Andre and Dorcas are particularly disturbing because, where Humbert Humbert mainly fantasizes about his nymphete, the Harrows enact their disturbing fantasies on multiple trusting girls who are left in shambles after their experiences. This was the first piece I've read by Joyce Carol Oates and I know now that I will certainly read more. Her writing is precise and beautiful, her characters vivid and realistic, her plot twisted and mysterious. This was a rather dark story so the novella format made perfect sense.

It seemed sexy and intriguing, and as I'm on yet another break from The Sound and the Fury, I thought I'd pick it up from the library.The novel--or novella, perhaps, because it's only 138 pages--is about Gillian, a 1970s college student who falls desperately in love with Andre Harrow, one of her professors, as well as with Harrow's wife Dorcas, a sculptor of primitive and scandalous \"totems\"--statues of various and occasionally grotesque human forms.In many ways, Beasts reminded me of watching Black Swan. It goes down easy--I finished it in a day--and seems awfully meaningful while you're experiencing it, but in the end is perhaps little more than titillation and tawdriness masquerading as depth. If that sounds unnecessarily harsh, I certainly don't mean it as an insult. Black Sawn gave itself more credit than it deserved for making some kind of a significant statement (about repressed desires, or the masochism that accompanies the pursuit of perfection, or something), when in fact it's appeal rested in its two principle narrative elements: sex and madness. My favorite review of that movie (courtesy of Dan Kois on Slate) was a single sentence: \"It's a fucking piece of trash, and I totally loved it.\"Now, I don't know that I'd say that Beasts is a piece of trash, necessarily, but there is certainly the distinct whiff of trashiness about it. For all that it alludes to D.H. Lawrence's poems and Ovid's Metamorphosis, it's really about one girl's juvenile infatuation and the lurid sexual tastes which some people indulge behind closed doors. It feels like it wants to make some kind of a grand statement about our animal instincts or the extent to which we're willing to forfeit our human dignity in the name of hedonistic pleasure in the here and now, but really it's just about sex.And you know what? That's okay. There are certainly less interesting things to read about (just wait for my review of The Sound and the Fury). This was my first experience with Oates' work, so I don't know if some of her other books are more literary or whether she's always this...accessible (I don't know what it says about me that I equate \"literary\" with being inaccessible), but my interest is certainly piqued.3.5 stars (rounded up to 4, since GoodReads won't let me do half-stars)."}, {"userName": "Annie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie", "userReview": "This book reminds me of the sublimely disturbing sculptress (quelle coincidence, given the sculptress character in the book) Berlinde de Bruyckere. As with BDB's art, Oates' characters are all exposed as the rank, slowly degrading fleshy carcasses that they are, in spite of that which animates them- and the tension between that animating thing and the beastly suits they wear is emphasized. This book is intended to make you uncomfortable, to assault you with your own nightmarish animality lurking beneath the neatly tended surface. I love the constant return to DH Lawrence. I think he's a good choice for the themes of this book, and he's also, like, one of my all-time favourite authors/poets and I think he goes better with more things than even chocolate does, so I love Oates for showcasing him. Also love the classic choice of cover art. Super fitting.Interestingly, there's a humble, wholly non-literary, yet undervalued YA trilogy with bizarrely similar plot, themes, creepy undercurrent, and obsession with fire. The \"Losing Christina\" trilogy by Caroline B Cooney in the early 90s. It's actually fantastic and intelligently conceived. Read it if you were into Beasts.JCO definitely made a good first impression on me. Will be reading more of her when I get a chance."}, {"userName": "Bark", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2905339-bark", "userReview": "I've enjoyed the few books I've read by Joyce Carol Oates. She always has some nicely dark edges to her stories and never bloats them with useless prose and description. When I first saw this one while nosing around here on someone's goodreads bookshelf the cover intrigued me and I knew I had to check it out. Set in the 1970's this short book is about a young college student named Gillian who has a painful crush on one of her professor's who makes it a habit, it seems, to seduce his young charges with his piercing eyes and fierce poetry critiques and then brings them home where his wife drugs them and they all have sex . This professor seems to enjoy breaking down these young women, first by forcing them to write out their darkest secrets for class and then by the sex and drugs. He seems a bit slimy and horribly unlikable to me but I'm not a naive 20-something coming of age in the 70's. . . This book leaves a lot to the imagination which is almost worse than spelling it out in gory detail. I enjoyed it but in the end am relieved it was only a novella because I don't think I'd want to spend any more time with these people."}, {"userName": "Kimberly Ann", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5027584-kimberly-ann", "userReview": "This felt more like a long short story or novella than anything else, to me, which perhaps it was billed as? I don't know. The writing was good and the ideas that it engaged with (or began to engage with) were interesting. I've never read much Oates except a short story here and there. I do enjoy a good story where much of what happens is personal and really more of things happening within someone than action-wise--so yeah, I did enjoy this, though i do feel like it's probably the tip of the iceberg for Oates, not being widely read within her oeuvre."}, {"userName": "Nate D", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/406701-nate-d", "userReview": "Joyce Carol Oates has written an incredible number of novels and stories, several a year for her entire five decades of productivity, I think, which makes me (perhaps unfairly) somewhat skeptical. However, so far everything I've read from her, a handful of stories and two novels, has proven worthwhile.This one is a creepy, focused depiction of collegiate cult of personality and immolation. Gothic tints, no unneccessary gestures, altogether enjoyable. Perhaps a little thin on characterization, but it's essentially a novella, so its minimalism is deliberate."}, {"userName": "Deodand", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/264971-deodand", "userReview": "This was great - and just as long as it needed to be.
