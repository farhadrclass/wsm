(i am only on page 15 of the cove, so this could change)whenever i try to hand-sell this at work, i will usually just say: \"it is like macbeth in a logging community. with a greek chorus.\" which as a customer, i would hear and think, \"i must read this book.\" but it doesn't always work. heathens.i mean, that's still as good a description as i can come up with, although serena gets her hands way dirtier than lady mcb. more like \"out, damn river of blood.\"this is a historical piece, chronicling the rise of an uber-power couple in a 1929 logging town in north carolina. serena enters the community after her new husband has already established himself there, and has already fathered a child on a local girl. she is displeased. and when serena is displeased, people are going to get hurt.serena is one of the most wonderfully single-mindedly ruthless characters i have ever read. she knows her way around a logging operation better than her husband, she hunts and rides better than any of the men she and her husband oversee, and she has a freaking falcon. (i don't have my book with me right now, but i am pretty sure it is a falcon. it is some kind of bird that hangs out with its master and is completely badass.) when she discovers that she is unable to bear a child herself, she sets out to destroy the one her husband has already fathered. and the girl. and the girl's father. and anyone else who has anything to say about it.ron rash is an amazing man for description. he knows these logging towns, he knows the woods and the men who work there. there is so much life in this story, and most of it; the people and the trees they are felling, is the last gasp of this life. all is destruction.i know i have said this in a another review somewhere, but what heightens the impact of this book is not only the danger of serena (and her husband ain't no pleasant master, either) but the danger of nature itself. like in my beloved descent, where the caves are just as dangerous as any subterranean monsters, cutting down gigantic trees is also extremely dangerous. many men will die, through natural accident or manipulation by the most ambitious couple in literature.this is a glorious book, and needs to be read by all. except elizabeth. it has too much animal-death for her. it is a deadly operation,after all.a quick note about how saddened i am that the movie that was in the works with darren arnofsky and angelina jolie got canceled. the word is now that there will still be a movie by susanne bier starring bradley cooper and jennifer lawrence, which is fine, but this character just screams jolie to me.old stupid review:this book has so damn much in it: the murderous machinations of the macbeths, the steinbeckian/old testament themes of justice and revenge, the casual murders nature can wreak that are cormac mccarthy cowboyish... and a greek chorus of sorts. i have name-dropped!! i have loved appalachia! i have finished my paper!"}, {"userName": "Brina", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2933855-brina", "userReview": "Since joining the southern literary trail group on goodreads, I have discovered many gifted authors who I normally would not have considered. It is in this regard that I was lead to the works of Ron Rash, a literature professor at Western Carolina university. Rash has won multiple awards for his novels, and I decided on Serena as the first of his novels to read. George and Serena Pemberton are timber barons from Boston who have set up a logging camp in western North Carolina. Set in 1929 in the early days of the depression, the Pembertons fell trees at the expense of the fledging National Park Service who desire the land for themselves in order to leave a lasting gift for the American people. The loggers believe, however, that people need jobs more than an enduring present. This battle for the land becomes a plot that lasts for the duration of the novel. Serena is ruthless and will not let the National Park Service or anyone else stand in the way of her dreams. Compared by many to Lady Macbeth, Serena employs a one-handed log camp worker named Galloway to murder anyone who threatens to stand between her and her ultimate goal, which is to set up a logging empire in virgin Brazilian forests. Having read Macbeth, I believe that Serena is more evil than her Shakespearean counterpart. Rash also employs a Greek chorus as loggers discuss Serena's bidding, adding to her lore in the logging camp. Her exploits astride an Arabian mare while training an eagle all the while proving equal than the male camp workers strengthen her myth. As her myth grows, so does her ruthlessness, and Rash follows this through the novel's conclusion. Meanwhile, the one thing Serena wants but cannot have is a male heir. Prior to her arrival at the camp, George fathered a child by teenage camp waitress Rachel Harmon, and the child is his spitting image. Serena makes George choose between her and them, causing her husband to pull on his conscience. Serena becomes obsessed with seeking out Rachel and her son, creating a thrilling page turner that lasts for the last third of the novel. I am sure that Serena will not be my last Rash novel. He has created memorable, fleshed out characters while writing strong prose that appeals to literary aficionados. Yet, Serena's character and quest also favors people who prefer thrillers. I enjoyed the balance between literary fiction and thriller as I read about depression era North Carolina, and I am extremely looking forward to reading more of Rash's books."}, {"userName": "Will Byrnes", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes", "userReview": "In the primeval woods of North Carolina, young timber baron, George Pemberton, brings his bride, Serena, to live with him in his kingdom. He had been busy enough already, fathering a child with a local girl and clear-cutting wide swaths of land. Serena quickly establishes herself as a power in her own right, knowledgeable about the timber business from her family background in Colorado, frightened of nothing and totally, totally ruthless. She is both an almost deitific figure and a satanic one. She will tolerate no criticism and her ambition is beyond measure. Beware, any who would cross her path. Both murderer of people and proud rapist of the landscape, she acquires a henchman to take care of her dirtiest deeds, among which is the removal of George\u2019s bastard child, and the child\u2019s mother, and enlists a non-human assistant as well. Literature with a capital L. Serena is one of the great dark females in literary history, up there with Livia, Lady MacBeth and others of their ilk. Beautiful, beautiful writing. This is the most satisfying read I have had all year (2009). Ron Rash is a major find. It is a wonder that he is not as well known as Ondaatje or others on that high plain. A feast, a powerful tale accompanied by a symphony of classical and literary tones. Hubris, greed, man and god, doing the right thing, magic, vengeance, good and evil, the essence of America, capitalism, and with a Greek chorus to boot. If this is not made into a world-class, best-picture level film it will be a huge, huge loss. This is a very cinematic book, rich in color, scenery, imagery, dramatic settings, shocking events, bigger than life characters, and all with purpose. Major, major work. It makes one yearn for more. June 6, 2017 - I was alerted by GR friend Linda to the following from April 2017 - WCU's Ron Rash wins Guggenheim Fellowship - Rash deserves all the recognition there is, he is a national treasure.================================THE FILM2/10/15 - I wrote the above, somewhat thin, review several years back. If anything, it understates the power of the book. It was only a matter of time before the novel was translated to the big screen. It will be opening in the US later this month. I was honored to attend, yesterday, a screening of the new film, starring Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper. Although hopes had been high initially, once the project got under way it became apparent that all would not end up as hoped. It was not, for example, taken on by one of Hollywood's A-list directors, despite the acting star-power. The result is, while not a bad film, not an exceptional one either, and that is a huge shame. The problems are diverse. The performances are quite good, as one would expect. Liberties were taken with the character of Serena that I thought did not help. In the book, for example, it is clear early on that Serena is a dark and powerful force, with a hearty dollop of madness mixed in. The film plays her softer in the beginning, and offers an event that purports to spark her madness. I was reminded of another film that got this sort of thing wrong. Sweeney Todd. In the original theatrical production, Sweeney returns to London, quite sane, but determined to seek vengeance on the evil-doer who had done him dirt. It is when he fails in his initial attempt at the evil Judge Turpin that Sweeney goes all meat-pie in the head. The disappointing film portrays him as bonkers from the start, making him so much less human, which dilutes the impact of the savagery in which he engages. In Serena, she is a primal force from the git-go, and there is no need for the film to justify her dark-doings with an intermediate event. It is like attempting to justify a tornado. Don't. It just is. Bradley Cooper's character, Pemberton, seemed a bit harsher in the film than in the book, where he was much more driven by events than he is in this treatment. The book was written, at least in part, as a look at the rape of the land in North Carolina,  I thought it was a better way to look at the present, through the past. I wrote Serena because of what was happening a couple of years ago, with environmental issues -particularly it looked like there was going to be some really extensive logging in National Forests. It didn't quite happen as badly as I thought it was going to happen, but certainly the threat was there. - from 18:05 of Stacey Cochran\u2019s interview with Rash on  more2read.com \nstanding in for the rape of the land today, but that cinematographical smorgasbord was left on the table, mostly untouched. There are some scenes that let us in on the damage being done, particularly a brilliant scene in which Pemberton, in a public forum, challenges those who propose a national park that will include his land. But a lot more could have been offered visually to reinforce this theme. Instead of a slow and steady build up of tension and pressure, the film seemed to mosey along, stopping far too often to linger in far too many closeups, making this one hour forty nine minute film feel much longer. The ending of the story, for Serena, is changed from that of the book. I suppose it is understandable, but I was hoping for greater allegiance to the original material. Rash was asked, in a 3/24/15 interview by Judith Rosen in Publishers Weekly about his involvement with the film adaptations of Serena and an earlier novel I made a decision early on not to read either screenplay. I answered a few questions from the screenwriters but was otherwise uninvolved in the filming. For me, that was better. I was deep into a new novel during that period and preferred to concentrate on something that, unlike film, I knew I could do well. Of course I hoped the movies would be as true as possible to my novels, but it is a different medium so differences are inevitable. Someone once asked Harry Crews what a film \u201cmight do\u201d to his book, and he answered that a film didn\u2019t change a single word in the book itself. That seems a good attitude for a writer to take.\n A couple of minor notes, there is an unintentional joke when Cooper's character is referred to by another as a lousy shot. The trailer for the film contains a fabulous shot of Serena launching an eagle from her arm. Somehow that did not make it into the final cut. The film is definitely interesting, but it struck me, overall, as a melody that was slightly out of tune, a drum that was off the beat, and a huge opportunity that was lost to bring one of the best novels of our time to the big screen. I can only hope that the presence of J-Law and Cooper can bring enough attention to Ron Rash's great novel to propel an increase in his readership. As one of our greatest living writers, he deserves that. He certainly deserved better than this only-ok film."}, {"userName": "Jeffrey Keeten", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3427339-jeffrey-keeten", "userReview": "\u201cA kind of annihilation, was what Serena called their coupling, and though Pemberton would never have thought to describe it that way, he knew her words had named the thing exactly.\u201d \nBradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence play the power couple in the 2015 movie.George Pemberton brought back a wife from Boston. More than a wife, more of a force of nature as dangerous as a witch and as pretty as an angel. He feels stronger with her by his side, and though never a man lacking in confidence, that self-assurance is further emboldened by the Machiavellian counsel of his new wife. Before going to Boston to marry Serena, Pemberton fathered a child on a young girl named Rachel, a worker in the timber camp. When he returns after basking in the glow of his new wife, he can\u2019t understand why he ever found Rachel attractive. In a place where women age quickly, her youth was her banner of attraction, but now he has Serena. Rachel had a boy, the spitting image of Pemberton. Rachel pays the price of her dalliances with Pemberton, not just with having an illegitimate child which seems potentially punishment enough, but by the condescending judgment of the other \u201cChristian\u201d women in the camp. What was she to do, tell him no? The women refuse to speak with her or even sit with her at lunch as if the taint of her sin could pass to them. \u201dShe realized that being starved for words was the same as being starved for food, because both left a hollow place inside you, a place you needed filled to make it through another day.\u201dIt is really hard to like people sometimes.On the other hand, it is very easy to like Rachel. If one zig or zag of life had went a different direction, most of those women spurning her could have found themselves in a similar circumstances or worse. Compassion is something we all need from time to time, and though some of our bad fortune may be left at our own doorstep, rarely is anything all our fault. Sometimes fate just shakes out a pair of snake eyes. There is this moment where Rachel is out in the middle of nowhere, slightly astray, but temporarily free from the burden of anxiety. \u201dShe looked at the stars and they brightened and dimmed in accord with her breathing, as if one hard puff might blow the whole lot of them out like candles.\u201d So much of our life is spent just stumbling forward barely noticing what is in front of us, but because she stopped, even ever so briefly, and looked at the stars, Rachel brought the universe to the cusp of her lips. Maybe some of that was in the attraction Pemberton once felt for her. \nThe right pet for the lady that wants to be taken seriously.Serena is almost mythological among the men of the timber camp. She rides around with an eagle perched on her arm. She sends the bird out to kill rattlesnakes to reduce the number of bitten workers. The men admire her, lust after her, and fear her. \u201cHe (George) suspected the workers thought of Serena as beyond gender, the same as they might some phenomenon of nature such as rain or lightning.\u201d Men who cross Pemberton or even men who get in his way start having mishaps. The Pembertons become richer and more powerful. In the backwoods of North Carolina, they can get away with...well...anything. One good man isn\u2019t enough to stand up to them. It takes a community, but this is 1929 and everyone is more afraid of losing their job than they are at stopping wickedness especially when the devil and his handmaiden have the keys to the gold. Pemberton has a loose moral code. Well it\u2019s not really much of a code per say as a philosophy of life. It is more of a what\u2019s best for Pemberton code, and any soft edges he might have once possessed have been turned jagged with the steady influence of Serena. From the beginning, she seduces him with her sexual assurance and her focused intelligence. He has never met anyone like her, and fortunately for most of humanity, there are few like Serena. As they get away with the worst of crimes, it only encourages them to do more. Every villain or villainess needs a henchman. When Galloway loses a hand, he expects to be sent down the road to a life of poverty and despair until Serena offers to keep him on the payroll as long as he is willing to do whatever she needs done. He is understandably grateful, but there is only so much a man should sell of his soul to keep his place on this earth, and certainly Galloway decides to sell more than what any man should. Pemberton is kept more and more in the dark as Serena clears a path for him. The swath she clears is not unlike the surface of the North Carolina hills after they are done harvesting trees. \u201dThe valley and the ridges resembled the skinned hide of some large animal.\u201dWhen Serena loses a child and learns she can\u2019t have more, she is upset for now there is someone who has given Pemberton what she can\u2019t. She turns her thoughts to the child and the mother. Rachel has to run with the specter of the one armed man haunting her at every turn. \u201dBriars grabbed her legs and each time there was an instant she thought Galloway had her.\u201dWill Pemberton finally do something? Or is even this beyond his control? Is he willing to sacrifice his only offspring on the altar of Serena? Is this one time when God deigns to throw a glance at the workings of man or in this case... one woman?\nGeorge, there are things you can live with and there are even things that YOU can\u2019t live with.Uriah Heep is always the first villain of fiction that comes to my mind when I think of a character that gave me the most chills, but Ron Rash\u2019s creation, Serena Pemberton, certainly goes on the list. We are all born with a natural need for self-preservation. We have varying degrees of things we are willing to do to save ourselves. This can even be applied to less immediately dire concerns, like bettering our position in a financial or social way. There is something feral about people like Serena who perceive all threats or nuisances as equally threatening, whether it be a true rival or just a person who has become less useful. We\u2019ve come to accept ruthlessness in a certain kind of man, but we still find it jarring when a woman is the one capable of being so merciless.

You might not like her, but the novel\u2019s title character is capable, resourceful and ruthlessly ambitious. I also enjoyed how Rash used the battle to create the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (early environmentalists versus timber interests in the late 1920s) to frame his fictional story. As was the case with The Cove (a Ron Rash novel I read in the spring), I was continually impressed with Rash\u2019s writing; his descriptions evoke the land and the people who inhabit it. And his use of historical details is always intriguing. In the end, though, Serena is written as a larger than life character in a way that undermines her believability. I also felt that foreshadowing in the book was a little heavy-handed and took suspense away from the unfolding plot.

But the main problem is the paper-thinness of the main characters. Halfway into the book, I was still straining to figure out which name referred to which character, since none of them had been given any distinct personalities. And I think I'm supposed to admire the main characters, but hate them at the same time since they're fairly heinous? But honestly, I felt nothing besides boredom for them. They were flat and uninteresting. I couldn't even love to hate them, or get excited as I saw them setting up their inevitable downfall. Pemberton is a tall, strong, ruthless man who shows a \"common touch\" by doing the work that he asks his employees to do; I think we're supposed to find this modern and admirable. Serena is a tall, strong, ruthless woman whose entire character development comes from her really super cool pissing contests with the men which proves how strong she is. Oh, and she tames an eagle and an Arabian horse, because...she is wild and untamed? I think? And is forever after described as riding her Arabian with the eagle on her arm, even if she's just going to the damn kitchen. It feels like the author's fantasy of himself and his perfect mate were masturbated onto the page.The redeeming parts of the book (to me) were the descriptions of the mountains of Virginia. It seemed like the author put a lot of research into the flora and fauna in the area, and how logging was changing the landscape. I found Rachel's story the most interesting, just because it dealt with how a person in the Appalachian mountains survived in the 1920s.

There are enough of them that Jennifer Lawrence can\u2019t possibly play them all in movie versions. Serena qualifies for the club with her street smarts (or its Appalachian equivalent), her initiative, and her poise in the face of danger. Too bad she\u2019s also a bloodthirsty, bad-to-the-bone sociopath. She and her husband George Pemberton are Depression-era timber barons in North Carolina. We\u2019re introduced to them as newlyweds as they got off the train from Boston only to be greeted by a young teenager carrying George\u2019s child along with the girl\u2019s father who had a knife and no mind to negotiate. Serena told the girl she was lucky to have such a sire, but that she wouldn\u2019t be so lucky again. The father wanted to settle matters, and Serena calmly told Pemberton that he should get his knife and do exactly that. At least it was a somewhat honorable fight. Later encounters would be less so.It didn\u2019t take long once they reached camp for Serena to establish herself as the alpha dog. Her father was a timber man in Colorado before she was orphaned, and he had taught her the business well. The men never doubted her knowledge or fortitude. In the coolest example of her mettle, she imported a large eagle and trained it to kill rattlesnakes with its dagger-like talons. That was one less danger for the men, but plenty of others still existed. It was said that if you took all the body parts that were lost in accidents and stitched them together, you\u2019d get a new man every month. But at that time, you could always get more workers.Soon enough, major impediments stood in their way. Conservationists wanted the timberland for National Parks, the various interests in the company partnership began to diverge, and the local law didn\u2019t always see eye to eye with Serena and her accomplice in almost all matters, Pemberton. Once it was established the extremes to which Serena and Pemberton\u00b9 would go, there wasn\u2019t much nuance left in the characters. Good and evil were clearly established. With a view of logging as land rape, it could be no other way. On the good side of the ledger, there was Rachel, the pregnant girl in the first chapter. She, too, was strong and resourceful, but with a lot less control. Things are more difficult with a baby and no savings. She was the third POV character and a good one for showing the life and times. The local sheriff was a good guy, too. He was one of the few officials who could not be bought by the Pembertons. Assorted loggers were featured as well, serving, as someone said, as a kind of Greek chorus. They reflected the highlander culture and language while offering commentary on the conflicts they witnessed. And with the story\u2019s many conflicts, they had plenty to discuss. But I won\u2019t (in the interest of spoiler forbearance).Despite seeing each successive problem a mile away, and venturing a good guess about what the reactions would be (it\u2019s checkers, not chess), Rash keeps us turning the pages. He\u2019s a good story-teller and has a very fluid style. I liked how he painted the landscape with his words. He also gave a strong sense of how even very simple lives involve specialized survivor skills that you and I probably don\u2019t possess. For instance, Rachel had to know where to look for ginseng, how to keep the bees, and how to patch a chimney. These were as important to her as knowing the mot juste would be to a Valley girl for social survival.The one thing I didn\u2019t care for in an otherwise great book was how little internal conflict there was once Serena\u2019s relentlessness was established. She ceased to be anything more than an Ayn Rand character raised to the 666th power. There are plenty of other things to like, though. If the following quote by Rash in my edition\u2019s P.S. section is an indication, maybe the main character was the region and its shared humanity all along. Serena was just its foil.\nTo me, one of the most interesting aspects of literature is how the most intensely \u201cregional\u201d literature is also often the most universal. There\u2019s no better example of this than Joyce\u2019s Ulysses. The best regional writers are like farmers drilling for water; if they bore deep and true enough into that particular place, beyond the surface of local color, they tap into universal correspondences, what Jung called the collective unconscious. Faulkner\u2019s Mississippi, Munro\u2019s Ontario, and Marquez\u2019s Colombia are exotic, and they are also familiar.\n\u00b9I was tempted to shorten this pair to S&P, but I suspect they need no further insinuation as symbols of big business as it\u2019s purported to be, rapacious and predatory."}, {"userName": "Agnieszka", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2446508-agnieszka", "userReview": "Not much to say about that one from me. Well-paced, set in North Caroline during the great depression story depictures title charackter who, alongside with her husband, is to create a timber empire. I thought the novel was very well written, with great sense of time and place but unfortunately the main protagonist left me unimpressed. Comparisons to Steinbeck\u2019s or McCarthy\u2019s epic novels feel a bit exaggerated to me. Serena lacks that truth and depth and dark essence flowing through novels of mentioned above. I remember Cathy from East of Eden and how I felt about her. Serena left me cold. Manipulative skills and lack of moral scrupules was perhaps to help her to deal with unfriendly and mainly man\u2019s world but unfortunately didn\u2019t lend her complexity and psychological depth. Yes, I found Serena rotten to the core but instead of reading about her riding with her eagle, agreed, very scenic but mostly laughable, I wanted to know what made her, what shaped her the way she was. Her figure remained undeveloped to the very end. Yes, demonic and dangerous yet somehow grotesque. I counted for more multifaceted personality. I counted for some emotion there. Saddly, she felt awfully one-dimensional to me. And the scene where her eagle was fighting with huge lizard, sorry guys, it made me cringe.Ok, I get it, Pemberton thought with his dick rather when he hooked up with her but their relationship lacks of ember, and I\u2019m not thinking about their bedroom activity. They are really worth each other, with one notable exception, and on the way to their goal they leave quite a pile of corpses. But there is a strange coldness I feel about them, they are evil and vicious, and yet I didn\u2019t give a damn about them. It should feel outrageous and repugnant, I should be furious or disgusted or something meanwhile reading about murderous duo I was betting who would be the next prey to them. To have all bad guys established there is a twisted sidekick of Serena yet. And to balance the story there is a local sheriff, the last man standing in this wide-open town and oppressed innocents in persons of Rachel, previous Pemberson\u2019s mistress and her little son, Jacob.I liked historic setting; socio-economic background and life in logging camp felt very reliably to me; predatory exploitation, greed, scorched earth policy and no-holds-barred as a general rule both in life and business shown outright and without sentimentality. I enjoyed scenery, beautiful yet harsh landscape; descriptions of wild, primary nature with its dangers: venomous snakes, bears, cougars even, also depiction of working conditions and exploitation of woodsmen were picturesque and very apt. Secondary characters quite well drawn, also using group of woodcutters as a kind of greek chorus commenting events seemed rather fine device. I only can imagine how the novel could be if only Serena hadn't been so cartoonish, if in her portrait had been less silk and lace and more psychological truth, if she hadn\u2019t felt as provincial lady Makbeth. Regrettably, the weakest point in Serena was just Serena."}, {"userName": "Lara", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1021604-lara", "userReview": "I would give this three & a half stars if I had that option. Sadly, I do not. I feel a bit shmuckish for not enjoying this book more than I did, and after some serious pondering I have come to the conclusion that I would probably have loved this book if I had a Y chromosome.Seriously.It's not that it isn't entertaining. I just couldn't really get myself to give two craps about any of the characters. And I couldn't suspend my disbelief enough to find any of it realistic. (I mean, seriously? They are so in love that they have crazy awesome sex every single night, and not one single night is one of them like, \"Uh, not tonight, honey, I have a headache\"? Yeah, right. But see, if I were male, I would totally dig that.Not to mention the immediate knife-fight scene and all the other manly punches throughout the book.I said earlier that it's not that it isn't entertaining, and I meant it. I also think it's not that the book is poorly written - because, damn, there are some incredible passages. (Don't believe me? Skip to page 71, the very last paragraph, and read down mid-way to page 72. Bears have never EVER seemed so real.) What? You don't want to go find that passage? fine. I'll give you a teaser sentence: \"He smelled the bear, the musk of its fur, its spilling blood, smelled the forest itself in the earthy linger of acorn each time the bear exhaled.\"Ultimately, I really do think it comes down to my general femaleness. We'll test this out when I wrap this book up and give it to my dad for Christmas to see what he thinks of it. And - lest you think I'm a total cheapskate - my dad is impossible to buy for, partly because if he wants anything he buys it for himself, and partly because he doesn't want me or my sister to spend much money on him. Even if he doesn't love the book, he'll love the fact that I got it for free and then re-gifted it to him.But I digress."}, {"userName": "Britany", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5550397-britany", "userReview": "Serena is a slow burn of a novel brimming with darkness and intrigue.It's 1929 in Waynesville, NC and plowing trees for timber is a booming industry.

She is one of the most developed characters, I've ever met in a book and I couldn't get enough of her conniving and brutal ways. She takes over Pemberton's life and quickly starts making decisions to get exactly what she wants-- complete with a one-handed lackey!This book was wonderfully written, the atmosphere of the time period set against the bleakness of the sawed timer was beautifully tragic. In addition to the barren landscape, Serena finds herself in the same predicament as the landscape that she has claimed. The author really made you work for this book, slowly introducing and destroying the environment that he created. I really enjoyed reading this book, more of a slow burn than a page-turner. I couldn't wait to see what Serena would do next, the only downside was that the author didn't give us too much in her background, but ultimately it wasn't necessary.

Also I have a history of not enjoying books where bad things happen to animals. This dates back to Black Beauty, read as a teenager, so it is pretty much a fixed part of my personality now.

Serena takes place during the Great Depression, where anyone would do anything for a little change in their pockets, even the Pembertons. What would this couple do to keep their company, and their love afloat? Do you really want to know? At first this novel seemed great, and had a lot of potential. Serena is a bad ass chick. She is masculine, determined, independent, confident, and smart. I was hypnotized by her like any man, or woman would be in her presence. I never read of a stronger woman who tames hawks, and does the work of men. She was equal to her husband and partner, George, which is quite extraordinary during the time period. I quit mowing the lawn after I got married, because I didn't want to, but here is Serena just whooping ass in the work field. I can see where women could be jealous of her. Then you have this meek, young woman, Rachel, who becomes a little bit more stronger, independent, and confident to survive the hardships of the mountains. There were a lot of strong women in this novel, and I loved that feature.I liked the historical factor of this book, and how Ron Rash writes the cruelty of the depression, and the work environment. After awhile I thought this was it of the narrative. It was anticlimactic, and I expected more ruthlessness. I thought the actions of Serena were out of character, but at the same time in character. Serena just seemed super confident, and didn't care for things beneath her, so it just left me confused. I was kind of disappointed in the novel, and was going to rate it in the two star range. I would have more fun reading The Revenant by Michael Punke again. It would have gave the historical benefits with more action. The younger Alex would of stopped listening to this novel. I did think that this book just wasn't for me. I was going to shrug it off as a fail and move on to the next, but the last few chapters grasped my attention. I was preparing for my daughter's first dental visit while listening to the novel. At one point I was so engrossed that I stopped what I was doing. This is why I gave it a higher star rating.The audible version was pretty good. Phil Gigante has a great narration voice, and he did change his inflection for each character. I thought that was great, even though one character reminded me of the Farmer in South Park. I did chuckle at that, but I appreciate the effort. It is really hard to change voices.

It\u2019s so enormous, spectacular, all-encompassing that the listener can scarcely breathe. The tension and power lead to flights of imagination such that the music inhabits the soul. Maestro Marin Allsop tells us Carmina Burana is \u201call about fate and fortune and how that impacts our lives, and also the hushed quality after this enormous opening. You know, suddenly, let me tell you a secret. Come closer.\u201dOh, but what better description could there be for Ron Rash\u2019s Serena? Rash\u2019s storytelling, though more tempered than the excesses of O Fortuna, is no less powerful. And Serena is certainly all about fate and fortune. Consider his opening paragraph:  \u201cWhen Pemberton returned to the North Carolina mountains after three months in Boston settling his father\u2019s estate, among those waiting on the train platform was a young woman pregnant with Pemberton\u2019s child. She was accompanied by her father, who carried beneath his shabby frock coat a bowie knife sharpened with great attentiveness earlier that morning so it would plunge as deep as possible into Pemberton\u2019s heart.\u201dAnd the chorus rises in a wave of sound as the tide of fate and fortune pulls the reader into this Shakespearean tragedy. The story opens in 1929 and continues into the early \u201830s, a time when America\u2019s greed and excess plunged the nation into economic and social despair. Serena and George Pemberton, newly wed after a blink-of-an-eye courtship, arrive in the backwoods of North Carolina to claim their fortune in timber. Serena, so brilliantly named for the icy cool exterior that hides the smolder within, enters the Great Hall of Female Antiheroes, standing alongside Lady Macbeth, Cathy Earnshaw, Morgan LeFay, and Medea. My strongest criticism of this novel is that Rash never gives us a cause to feel for Serena\u2014he hints only at some disaster that befell Serena as a younger woman in Colorado\u2014so we have no idea how this exceptionally learned woman achieved her schooling or her scales. She becomes more evil as the story continues, treading a very fine line between compelling character and Cruella de Ville caricature. But. Oh. I was so caught up in, delighted and horrified by this novel, by Rash\u2019s sumptuous writing and his wicked good storytelling, I would have followed him anywhere. It was sheer delight to unwrap the layers of his narrative, like a birthday present. Rachel\u2019s Mother Earth gentleness and the gut-churning tension of her plight contrasts brilliantly with Serena\u2019s rape and pillage of the Appalachian forests and her quest for absolute power. The Greek chorus of workers centers the action in time and place, allowing the reader to take a deep breath in between the cymbal-clashing action. George Pemberton embodies man\u2019s weaknesses of the flesh and heart. He tips the scales as his loyalties shift this way and that, his moral compass swinging wildly from True North. Rash is a writer of place, his gorgeous language conveying the lore, loveliness, and dangers of Appalachia like a song. But his characters are so ripe, hot red blood coursing through flesh, bones brittle and white, that they lead you inexorably on, deeper into the forest as it burns and crashes behind you. Serena has an enormous cast, shifting, changing, fighting, dying, but each character is so clearly defined and richly-drawn that there is no mistaking their vitality or purpose to the plot. And the plot: irresistible. Rash creates a primal parable of greed and power, weaving in themes of environmentalism, poverty and political will, that borders on melodrama, but with such precise skill that, like Orff\u2019s O Fortuna, your senses are elevated to the rafters and beyond.

It all happens hard and fast. In 1929 newlyweds George and Serena travel from Boston to the North Carolina Mountains where they plan to harvest timber and create an empire. The terrain is relentless, the characters rough and tumble and the story serves up greed, sex, deceit, death by logging, betrayal and murder.I should have loved it, but truth be told that while I recognized what a great story this was, I somehow felt disconnected.

There was absolutely no character development at all. Before he met Serena, George Pemberton was apparently a bit of a ladies man, however he was apparently completely enamored with Serena from the moment he met her - but the why is never explained.

Phew. Sunday totally counts, right? I finished this book quite a while ago but as always, life intervened and there was much internet-free gallivanting and acres of sand between my toes and billions of hours of driving last week, all of which conspired to prevent me from writing this review. Here\u2019s a picture of where I was:(That's not even a random photo that I found on the internet - my brother in law took that. That's what it looks like. All the time.) Can you really blame me for procrastinating? Can you? Alright, well all excuses aside I really loved this book. This was one of Karen\u2019s picks for me a few weeks ago on She Made Me Do It and I\u2019m so glad she put it in front of my eyes because I might never have found it otherwise. My favorite part of this book, without a doubt, is its titular character Serena. Some people, after suffering years of adversity, will become twisted and damaged and unable to function. Maybe even most people. And then there are people like Serena \u2013 who go up against adversity and seem to become honed by it. They walk through tragedy and all of their softer layers seem to get sloughed off, leaving them hardened and sharp. Serena is a girl who survived a deadly flu epidemic, burned her childhood home to the ground, braved the wildernesses of Colorado, found herself a suitably powerful lumber baron to marry, and set her sights on expansion. Any challenge that nature lays before her feet, she seems ready to take on - whether it be a deadly virus, a rattlesnake population, or the acres of virginal Brazilian rainforest she longs to mow down. And it isn\u2019t as if she triumphs over nature; she\u2019s far too much a part of it herself to be set apart in that way. Rather, she is the smartest, deadliest predator in the natural world she inhabits. In this wild place where several men die each week in the pursuit of lumber, Serena \u2013 a young, petite woman \u2013 seems the most fit to survive. She is willing to do whatever is necessary to ensure her place, including murder anyone who gets in her way, or anyone who may or may not get in her way at some unspecified future date. With her deadly pet eagle on one arm and her dedicated assassin on the other, Serena blazes off the page.Which is interesting, because the narration never hovers over her thoughts. Instead, it moves between Pemberton, Serena\u2019s formidable husband, and Rachel, Pemberton\u2019s teenage plaything from his life before Serena \u2013 neither of whom are even a tiny bit as interesting as Serena herself. Rachel\u2019s story really leads the narrative, and she\u2019s no doubt a very sympathetic character, but every time the narration switched over to her I felt a bit bored. Rachel struggles to survive on her own with an unwanted pregnancy and almost no support from anyone in the town. She scrimps and works her fingers to the bone and gets by on very little and raises her son well. It\u2019s all very inspiring\u2026but honestly, I just wanted to get back to Serena murdering people. That was much more interesting to me.However, as Serena\u2019s sights turn to Rachel, the mother of what it turns out will be Pemberton's only child, Rachel is forced to become craftier, harder, and more violent\u2026and then I started to like her a great deal more. I also just love that, by tormenting Rachel, Serena essentially becomes the instrument that hones her into a worthy adversary. That\u2019s just good old fashioned poetic justice right there.This book is like a brutal fairy tale set in the 1920's wilderness of America and starring the wicked witch.

He is an individual who sees the beauty of a tree only in terms of the price it will bring when felled and sold for timber.

Using tactics that would be envied by any modern-day CEO, Serena stealthily becomes George's financial adviser. A skillful puppeteer, she quickly convinces him that nothing and NO ONE must stand in the way of the quest to line their pocketbooks. It is only her one scheme - the one motivated by jealousy instead of greed, that causes her world to begin to unravel.There are some sympathetic characters. The local sheriff who becomes suspicious of the Pembertons is an admirable chap. And at the heart of the novel, is the young woman who has borne George a child out of wedlock. I became rather fond of several of the lumber camp employees who manage to serve as a Greek chorus, providing running commentary on folklore, religion, and the antics of their evil employers. Ultimately it is these simple, uneducated men who are the first to notice the damage done to the local environment.
