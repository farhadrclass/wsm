Hillary Jordan - image from NPR Two families, one black, one white, tied to the land, to each other, and stuck in the muck of a racist world. Jordan uses multiple narrators to offer varying perspectives on the events of the story. Laura, a Memphis schoolteacher, is on the fast track to old-maid-hood after her 30th birthday, when she is introduced to Henry McAllan. He is smitten, and she likes him well enough. Marriage is fine with her, but when a death in the family throws long-term plans onto the scrapheap, Henry announces that in two weeks they will be moving to a remote part of Mississippi to take over a farm. It comes to be called Mudbound, for obvious reasons. The novel merges struggles with racism with views of the hardships of farming life.

Henry\u2019s brother Jamie is a much (19 years) younger man, charming, a pilot, damaged by his war experience, (turning to alcohol to try to smother his recent visions of war and his still-sharp recollection of a near-death experience he\u2019d had as a child) and of dubious character in any case. (Is there really any there there?) He becomes friends with Ronsel Jackson, the black son of one of Henry\u2019s tenants, a successful, handsome member of a black tank corps. He had been a hero in Germany, was accepted there and in other parts of Europe as a man, a liberator, not as a black, but back home, the deep south remains the deep south and bigotry defines the limits of civilization, that form of madness personified by Henry and Jamie\u2019s vile father, Pappy.Jonathan Banks as Pappy McAllan \u2013 image from Stimme.deThis was a very fast read, a page-turner. Jordan does a nice job of slowly ramping up the tension until the climactic action. Carey Mulligan as Laura McAllan \u2013 image from collider.comShe has given us a portrait of a particular place in a particular time. I do not believe it to have been her purpose to tell a tale of the modern age (the book was published in 2006), yet it is impossible not to think of the blue on black violence that has tormented the nation and relate it to the overt racial violence of the mid 20th century South.Mary J. Blige as Florence Jackson - image from RottenTomatoes.comAlthough one might see Laura as the core of this story, and that is where the story began for Jordan, I believe it is Jamie around whom everything else moves. His relationship with Laura, the up and the down, help her define her relationship with Henry and with the world. His relationship with Ronsel is crucial to the dramatic events that follow. It is in the light of his personality that others see themselves more clearly.\n Laura was the first, and only, voice for some while. Mudbound started as a short writing exercise in grad school. The assignment was to write 3 pages in the voice of a family member, so I decided to write about my grandparents\u2019 farm \u2014 a sort of mythic place I\u2019d grown up hearing about, which actually was called Mudbound \u2014 from my grandmother\u2019s point of view. My teacher liked what I wrote and encouraged me to continue, and I tried to write a short story. Nana became Laura, a fictional character who is much more fiery and rebellious than my grandmother ever was, and the story got longer and longer. At 50 pages I realized I was writing a novel, and that\u2019s when I decided to introduce the other voices. Jamie came next, then Henry, then Florence, then Hap. Ronsel wasn\u2019t even a character until I had about 150 pages! And of course, when he entered the story, he changed its course dramatically. - from Loaded Questions interviewThere is much here about being heard, who can speak, and who, ultimately, is silenced. Garrett Hedlund as Jamie McAllanI have seen criticism about the use of stock characters here, and that is not without merit. Southern bigots are given only one coat of paint, as are strong black characters. Nonetheless, and in particular considering that this is a first novel, it is forgivable. Mudbound is a fine read, offering interesting characters, and a poignant view of race relations in the South, particularly after World War II. It is well worth the ride. It appears that the film that has been made of the novel has not only done it justice but maybe even exceeded the original material.

Eventually, it grew into a larger story with darker themes. But the first character she wrote about, Laura, was based on her own grandmother. \"I started out writing what I thought was going to be a short story in the voice of Laura,\" Jordan says, \"and as the story grew, I just found myself wanting to hear from other people.

It is set in the Mississippi Delta on a cotton farm, where life is hard and the work is backbreaking, and the brown colour dominates the mudbound landscape. With a mother fearful that her daughter would be left on the shelf, Laura marries Henry McAllan, a World War 1 veteran. Soon after, he moves them to the farm. City bred Laura finds her new surroundings a shock, both demanding and challenging. And then there is Henry's father, Pappy, a horrifying individual, full of bigotry and hate, who terrifies Laura and her children. This is a story of two families, the McAllans and the black Jacksons, bound uncomfortably together through their sharecropping agreements. The narrative is delivered from the perspectives of the two family members as events move to the inevitable beats of their conclusions and the part each of them plays in the tragedy. Two decorated soldiers return, the sensitive younger brother of Henry, Jamie, a pilot, and a different man. in comparison to Henry, and Laura is drawn to him. Ronsel Jackson served in the black tank divisions in Europe, and experienced what equality feels like there, only to return to the deeply entrenched racial divisions of home, where he and other black folk are seen as less than human. The two men form a friendship based on their common nightmarish war experiences for which they both turn to alcohol. However, the townsfolk are stirred to anger at the sight of a friendship that crosses their rigid demarcation of racial lines. This is a story of a marriage, women's roles, family dynamics, injustice, race and brutality. In effect, this is a raw and heartbreaking history of the US in a period of social change. Jordan develops her characters beautifully, giving us access to what they think and feel to catch a turbulent and divisive era. A brilliant read that I highly recommend.

From Jamie, seven times, from Ronsel, five times, from Henry, four times. From Hap and Florence, four times each. You might think that makes this primarily Laura\u2019s story, but it is a shared story of all those in both families, how they arrived at the places they did, and how the era and the people, including the townspeople, own a piece of this story, as does the land \u2013 the mud. It is as much a part of this story as any character. \n\u201dBut I must start at the beginning, if I can find it. Beginnings are elusive things.

Eventually Laura meets his brother, Jamie, time passes, and eventually Henry and Laura marry. It isn\u2019t long before she finds herself living on a farm, which is more of a farm-to-be, mostly mud when she first sees it. It goes from bad to worse, and it\u2019s a while before things begin to go from worse to better, and even then, there\u2019s Henry\u2019s father, Pappy, who represents the worst of the Jim Crow South in this small town in the middle of Mississippi. \n\u201dWhen I think of the farm, I think of mud.

Set in the Mississippi Delta, Mudbound will cause you to feel mired in the muck of the land as well as in the hatred and bigotry of this place and time. It is a story about two families, one black \u2013 the Jacksons, and one white \u2013 the McAllans, who become inextricably linked to one another. Laura is a city girl, on the brink of being labeled \u2018old maid.\u2019 When Henry McAllan rescues her from spinsterhood, she didn\u2019t realize that her life would be significantly altered when Henry decides to fulfill a lifelong dream of purchasing a piece of his own land. Laura\u2019s career as a teacher and her relatively easy living under the roof of her parent\u2019s home in Memphis have in no way prepared her for the life of a farmwife in a backwoods part of the country. \"When I think of the farm, I think of mud. Limning my husband\u2019s fingernails and encrusting the children\u2019s knees and hair. Sucking at my feet like a greedy newborn on the breast. Marching in boot-shaped patches across the plank floors of the house. There was no defeating it. The mud coated everything. I dreamed in brown.\"Initially I worried that the structure of the novel might not work for me. The events are told from multiple perspectives in alternating chapters. We hear from three of the McAllans \u2013 Laura, Jamie and Henry as well as three of the Jacksons \u2013 Florence, Ronsel and Hap. To my surprise, author Hillary Jordan managed to pull this off with much finesse, and I appreciated each individual viewpoint. By hearing from each of these characters, we gain a greater understanding of the complexity of the relationships between them. Nothing is simple; life is difficult, unjust and oftentimes downright cruel. Laura strikes up a friendship, albeit a complex one, with Florence Jackson, wife to the McAllan\u2019s tenant, Hap Jackson. The friendship begins out of necessity, loneliness and the bond the two women share \u2013 that of motherhood. When Florence\u2019s son returns from the war a decorated hero, another relationship develops between this young man, Ronsel, and Henry McAllan\u2019s troubled, younger brother, Jamie, also recently returned from the horrors of wartime Europe. These bonds are further complicated by the existence of Pappy, the McAllan\u2019s father, a loathsome and racist old man. He embodies all that is vile in the Jim Crow south, full of bitterness, misunderstanding, hatred and fear. The rain, the mud, and the tension constantly lurk in the reader\u2019s mind throughout the entirety of the novel. Like a storm gathering and threatening on the horizon, one knows that all will eventually come to a head and let loose all the pent up rage and menacing violence. I really couldn\u2019t turn the pages fast enough and resented the numerous interruptions while reading this book! This is a fairly quick read that is yet very meaningful. A myriad of issues are examined here besides the obvious one of racism. Marriage, sharecropping, infidelity, post-traumatic stress disorder, and motherhood are all touched upon with thoughtful care. The subject matter is weighty, but this book is extremely worthwhile and one I would highly recommend."}, {"userName": "Eleanor", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1300695-eleanor", "userReview": "I had sworn off any and all novels dealing with racial themes set in the South. There is only so much self-flagellating I can do in a year in penance for things in which I had no part. Certainly I realize that the theme is worth exploring, and that if you want to write a book set in the South, especially between the years covering Reconstruction through the Civil Rights era, race is going to play a part. This is all well and good, and admirable in that examining the past through the gauze of fiction can get at some of the smaller truths and nuances that non-fiction just can't. I was just weary of it. But a galley came in for this book, and I wish I could tell you what made me bring it home to read, but I honestly don't remember. Maybe it was the first paragraph.\"Henry and I dug the hole seven feet deep. Any shallower and the corpse was liable to come rising up during the next big flood: Howdy boys! Remember me? The thought of it kept us digging even after the blisters on our palms had burst, reformed and burst again. Every shovelful was an agony -- the old man, getting in his last licks. Still, I was glad of the pain. It shoved away thought and memory.\"Well, this was intriguing, so I flipped a few more pages in and stumbled on this:\"When I think of the farm, I think of mud. Limning my husband's fingernails and encrusting the children's knees and hair. Sucking at my feet like a greedy newborn on the breast. Marching in boot-shaped patches across the plank floors of the house. There was no defeating it. The mud coated everything. I dreamed in brown.\"It was at this point I got flashes of Ron Rash's brilliant One Foot in Eden, and my resolve to step away from novels that mention Jim Crow on their jacket blurbs faded away. Sometimes it is a good thing I don't stick to a plan.Hillary Jordan's Bellwether Prize winning novel subtly captures all the nuances of the South -- the uneasy inter-reliance the races have always had on each other; the familial ties that often defy explanation; and the realization that it was the fertile ground for change tilled during World War II in which the seeds of social change were planted.Mudbound is written in the alternating voices of the McAllan and Jackson families. They are bound together by the sharecropping arrangement between the two families, one white (the McAllans), the other black (the Jacksons). Jamie McAllan and Ronsel Jackson have both served their time in service to the country, and they each find themselves returning to a home that is at once familiar as air and foreign as Europe once was for them. Ronsel, especially, must cope with the memory of the sense of equality he enjoyed while in Europe and the abrupt return to the status quo of an unchanged South.Equally as off-balance in this world is Laura McAllan. She was raised in gentility, and the family land to which her husband is pledged is a far cry from anything she had ever known. Married to Jamie's brother, whose solid nature has, with familiarity, become thuddingly dull, Laura is rejuvenated by the handsome returning war veteran, Jamie. In him she sees the possibility of an awakening.The stage is set for disaster when Jamie and Ronsel strike up a friendship forged by the bonds of war, and from the moment that is set in motion until the final paragraph, I was riveted.The real treasure in this novel, however, lies in Jordan's masterful writing which captures every subtle gradation of the nature of the relationships between families of different races who depend on each other with a mixture of respect, fear, loathing, and affection. Nowhere is this dichotomy more eloquent than in a passage in which Laura speaks of Florence Jackson's daughter, Lilly May, who often accompanies her mother to the McAllan's house while Florence cleans the house. Laura speaks of Lilly May's beautiful voice:\"The first time I head her, I was playing the piano and teaching the girls the words to 'Amazing Grace' when Lilly May joined in from the front porch, where she was shelling peas. I've always prided myself on my singing voice but when I heard hers I was so humbled I was struck dumb. Her voice had no earthly clay in it, just a sure sweet grace that was both a yielding and a promise. Anyone who believes that Negroes are not God's children never heard Lilly May Jackson sing to Him.This is not to say that I thought of Florence and her family as equal to me and mine. I called her Florence and she called me Miz McAllan. She and Lilly May didn't use our outhouse, but did their business in the bushes out back. And when we sat down to the noon meal, the two of them ate outside on the porch.\"Mudbound took my breath away, and if Ms. Jordan's novel doesn't wind up with several more honors for it I'll be surprised."}, {"userName": "Emma Deplores Goodreads Censorship", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship", "userReview": "Social justice (and literature) liteThis book and I hit it off at first. It\u2019s a quick, easy read and I enjoyed the first 2/3 or so. But looking back, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to anyone.Mudbound is about two families living in the Mississippi Delta: one black and one white. It\u2019s 1946 and racial tensions are high: the black GIs returning from WW2 are no longer willing to put up with being second-class citizens, but the white population is equally unwilling to allow change. The book is written in the first person from 6 (six!) different viewpoints (and a debut novel at that.... had I not loved Jordan\u2019s When She Woke I would never have attempted this), including Ronsel (a black soldier), Hap and Florence (his parents), Jaime (a white soldier), Henry (his older brother) and Laura (Henry\u2019s wife). To her credit, Jordan does do a passable job with the multiple narrators, who don\u2019t sound too much alike--the streamlined nature of the writing, without much figurative language or description, helps with this, and the dialect works well enough without being impenetrable.As I said, I liked the story at first; it drew me in quickly and entertained me. But there isn\u2019t much more I can say for it. So, then, the problems:THE PLOT: Terribly predictable (and melodramatic). One-third of the way through I predicted all the dramatic events that would happen in the rest of the book. And I\u2019m not usually good at that.THE CHARACTERS: The black family are stock characters of the \u201csympathetic victims\u201d variety: hardworking, family-values folk. Hap is the forgiving, scripture-quoting preacher. Florence is the closer-to-earth midwife. Ronsel is the bright young guy who's beat down by the system. They have potential but are too stuck in their stock roles and personalities to realize it.The white family is more complex (they\u2019re allowed to have flaws), but not much more. Henry is a simple man who loves farming: exactly the same on the inside as he appears from the outside. His father, Pappy, is the stock evil racist with no redeeming qualities. Laura gets a lot of page time (and her voice feels the most authentic), but she\u2019s pathetic; she\u2019s pathetically grateful to Henry for marrying her at the ripe old age of 31 and despite a few attempts to act for herself, she\u2019s still pathetic at the end. (Bizarrely, in an interview in the back of the book Jordan states that Laura is based on her own grandmother, but \"much more fiery and rebellious\"--since neither adjective describes Laura in the slightest, I can only conclude either that Jordan's grandmother was an automaton, or, more likely, that Jordan utterly failed at turning the idea in her head into a character on the page.) Jamie is the most interesting of the bunch: he seems like a basically good guy whose PTSD leads him into destructive behavior, and he\u2019s racist in a subtle, Huckleberry-Finn kind of way (at least, the other white characters make him look subtle; more on that later).THE SETTING: Black and white, in more ways than one. Essentially, the rural South = bad; cities, or anywhere in Europe = good. \u201cViolence is part and parcel of country life,\u201d Laura tells us, and to prove the point, Jordan includes a family of bit-part characters that do nothing but rape, murder, and drunkenly shoot off guns (and these are the only farm people we meet aside from the main characters). The Mississippi Delta is full of violent racists, while the Memphis-bred Laura has apparently never even heard of Jim Crow. Europe, meanwhile, is a colorblind paradise; even German women are happy to sleep with black men and have their babies mere months after their own government finished murdering millions of pale-skinned people for not being white enough. (I\u2019m not disputing that similar liaisons happened, but I do dispute the \u201ccolorblind paradise\u201d portrayal. Read Andrea Levy\u2019s Small Island for a more nuanced portrayal of wartime and post-war England; as for Germany, well, I should think the attempt to massacre all non-Aryans to create a \"master race\" speaks for itself.) Finally, Jordan\u2019s failure to get even easily verifiable facts right makes me doubt her overall portrayal. The two closest towns to the McAllens\u2019 farm are Greenville and Marietta.... and while Greenville really is a Delta town, Marietta is actually over 200 miles away in the northeast part of the state.THE MESSAGE: Several underwhelmed reviewers have mocked the Bellwether Prize, which is meant to recognize a book that advances social justice in some way. I think the prize is a good idea. But the Washington Post nailed this one: \u201cthe book doesn't challenge our prejudices so much as give us the easy satisfaction of feeling superior to these evil Southerners.\u201d The thing is, to advance social justice, you have to be timely. Tackle, say, the drug war\u2019s disproportionate impact on minority communities, the poor quality of education in inner-city schools, the location of environmental hazards in minority neighborhoods. There\u2019s no end to current social justice issues that Jordan might have written about. Instead, her message is one that even most unreformed racists of today wouldn\u2019t dispute: racially motivated hate crimes are bad, folks! It's no wonder most people like this book: its message is so uncontroversial that nobody is uncomfortable with it. But you can't change society by hammering home points everybody already agrees with.(In fairness to Jordan, her second novel does take on timely, controversial issues; predictably, its reception has been more mixed. But it\u2019s also so much better.)In the end, I don\u2019t hate this book. If you want a quick, unchallenging read about the evils of racism, it may be the book for you. If you\u2019re looking for some redeeming social or literary value, though, best look elsewhere."}, {"userName": "Phrynne", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne", "userReview": "It is wonderful that an author can write something like this as their debut novel.

Two of the characters, Jaime McAllen and Ronsel Jackson, are young men who have just returned from the war and who have experienced things that link them more to one another than to their own communities. But, a friendship between a white man and a black man is not just risky, it is forbidden, and there is a sense of impending doom that hangs over the novel as it progresses.The picture we are given is a remarkably complete one, in that there is racism of varying degrees from friendship that conquers the barrier to absolute, Klan-style hatred, blind and unfeeling and dehumanizing. These characters are complex people with complicated feelings toward one another, and the hatred that possesses Pappy is not limited to people of another color. He is an evil man who mistreats his sons and misses no opportunity to make everyone around him unhappy. Laura and Florence attempt to bridge the gap and hold on to what is essentially human in one another, and they manage to do this primarily by recognizing the thing they have in common, motherhood.It is my experience that few modern authors are able to give a fair depiction of the Jim Crow south. Either every character is the devil incarnate, looking for someone they can torture of lynch, or they are drawn like caricatures of real people, without true emotions or feelings. Hillary Jordan managed to treat all of her characters with the respect that they deserved. Life at this time was hard for anyone living in rural Mississippi and, while change was coming, it was coming slowly to this area and with much resistance. If you take away the racial barriers, who is a sick man like Pappy ever going to feel superior to? Mudbound is an unflinching look at the horrors that were virtually inseparable from the society itself and the price that was paid by those who were caught in the hardtack life of the Jim Crow South, and a read worth steeling yourself for."}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3195534-melanie", "userReview": "I always find it odd to say I loved a book when the story told is unpleasant.

It is about complex relations between a white family that owns the land and a black family that helps to farm the land. It is also about war and the Jim Crow conditions that existed in the South during that era.Hillary Jordan, in her debut novel, took on the daunting task of presenting the story through the eyes of six different narrators. That would seem to be difficult enough, but making it even more difficult is the fact that there are both male and female narrators. Furthermore, three are white and three are black.The book (published in 2008) received almost universal critical acclaim. However (there almost always seems to be a however), I read one review which criticized the bouncing back and forth created by alternating narrators, saying that it disrupted the flow of the story. I don\u2019t buy that. I agree that if it had not been done with skill, it would have been a distraction. But it was done with great skill.I was reminded of David Payne\u2019s very fine novel, Ruin Creek (1993), in which he expertly told the story from the respective viewpoints of male and female narrators of different generations. But Jordan, who is white, did something even more daring by speaking with the voice of three black narrators, one female and two males \u2013 and she pulled it off.All of the principal characters are flawed to some degree or the other, but all have some redeeming qualities \u2013 except one. Pappy is a racist bigot of the worst kind. He hates black people, but then he doesn\u2019t have much use for white people either. He is a born hater.The reviewer who wrote the critical review mentioned earlier, found fault with how this character was presented, that he was unrealistic to the point of being \u201ccartoonish.\u201d But he isn\u2019t unrealistic; his type did exist, in fact, still exists. Times have changed, but people with Pappy\u2019s warped vision still exist in our society today.The reviewer summed up her criticism by saying that in the final analysis the novel failed because nobody \u201cchanged,\u201d and therefore what was the point? Well, the point might be, guess what, people don\u2019t always change. Sometimes there is no repentance or redemption. I suppose she expected them all to hold hands and sing Kumbaya at the end. But in this story, that would have been cartoonish.Reading this novel was like watching a slow motion train wreck that was about to occur. I knew something bad was going to happen, but I was powerless to do anything about it. It is not a good book for light summer reading at the beach, but it is a thought provoking book that deserves the wide readership that it has experienced and the favorable reviews that it has received.I ran across an interview with the author in which she is considering a sequel. Sequels are rarely as good as the original, but I would like to see what happens to these characters down the road. Who knows, maybe they will change.P.S. ~ Yes, I did focus on the negative review above, but I would be remiss if I didn't mention that there are a number of excellent, positive reviews of this book here at GR's and I recommend them for your reading enjoyment."}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "I first read this author's second novel, \"When she woke\" and being a Scarlet Letter fan I really enjoyed this modern day take on that novel.

Two strong women, one white, one black, different circumstances but both with a strong love for their families. The Mississippi Delta area, in the Jim Crow south, where fairness for backs just very seldom happened. I never really thought about the blacks that had fought in World War II, the Tuskegee Airmen, tank divisions and after discharge had to return to the south where their families were, and still told to use the back door of a business. I think that is what I loved about this book, it made me think about unfairness, injustice but about real strength as well. Appreciating what you have now yet doing what you can to make a small difference.

Like The Help or The Kitchen House, this is one of those books I guess which will continue to resonate, and linger in the mind. It's told by each character in turn, so we hear lots of different voices as the tale progresses, and we can witness the way they see the events unfolding. It reads a bit like a thriller, where the tension is building up and you know something bad is going to happen. It's set in the Delta (Mississippi) just after World War Two. We experience that in the Deep South of the USA little had changed since the abolition of slavery. It\u2019s powerful and dramatic and so well-written that it was hard to put down. This is an impressive first novel. Hilary Jordan did a fantastic job giving these characters a real voice, letting them speak in their specific languages. I could hear Hap and Florence and it was like they were talking directly to me.To me Ronsel is the real hero and I hope that all the \"could have beens\" at the end turn out to become reality for this exceptional young man.If you are looking for a beautiful, human, intelligent and gripping read, look no further."}, {"userName": "Jeanette  \"Astute Crabbist\"", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/796425-jeanette-astute-crabbist", "userReview": "There's a lot of depth here for such a fast, cleanly-written read.

Second, the haunted struggles of men who came home from WWII and couldn't make a place for themselves back among their own people. Third, the frustration and loneliness of an isolated Mississippi farm wife, building into desperation and rage. The combination of these difficulties causes the buildup of tensions that lead to some gruesome and heart-wrenching consequences.This story is told through the alternating voices of six characters. At first it feels disconnected, like it's just switching around among a bunch of separate stories. Be patient.

Any more shallower and the corpse was liable to come rising up during the next big flood. Howdy boys! Remember me? The thought of it kept us digging even after the blisters on our palms had burst, re-formed and burst again. Every shovelful was an agony--the old man getting in his last licks. Still, I was glad of the pain. It shoved away thoughts and memories.\" \nHenry and Jamie McAllan are brothers digging the grave for their father, Pappy. In the words of Shakespeare, \"Nothing became him in life like the leaving it.\"To cut to the chase, Hillary Jordanwrote a fine debut novel. The setting is the Mississippi Delta in 1946. Big brother Henry, a veteran of World War One, and a hard working member of the Corp of Army Engineers, marries city bred Laura of Memphis, Tennessee. Laura is thirty-one, an English teacher, whose mother had feared she would die an old maid.Following their marriage, Laura is shocked to learn that Henry always wanted to be a farmer. He has bought two hundred acres of rich Delta dirt and packs Laura and their two daughters off to a wonderful home which he had rented for them to live in while he worked the farm. However, Henry, ever trustful, has been duped. When they arrive at the home, Henry and family learn that the previous owner has sold the home. With all the soldiers returning from World War Two, there are no other houses to rent.\nMississippi Delta Cotton FieldNot only does Henry need a home for his wife and daughters, he needs one for his Pappy. Pappy is a curmudgeonly old man who tyrannizes Laura and terrifies his granddaughters.It's off to Henry's farm which he wants to name \"Fair Fields.\" Laura who quickly learns the farm floods every time the river rises dubs it \"Mud Bound.\" Not only does the land flood, but their home is cut off from the nearest town.Jordan deftly weaves the lives of the McAllan and Jackson families into a riveting story. Hap and Florence Jackson are tenant farmers on Henry's land. Florence is the community's mid-wife and purveyor of folk remedies. Florence also comes to work for Laura in the McAllan home. What Jordan does to create such a compelling read is the use of multiple voices. Mudbound is told initially by Jamie, Laura, Henry, Hap, and Florence. To Jordan's credit, each voice is unique, and each member of this chorus adds their own perfect thoughts and observations to propel the novel from start to finish. Jordan really hits her stride when she adds Ronsel Jackson, the eldest son of Hap and Florence. Ronsel has served in the European theater of war as a member of the Black Panthers, famous for their furious assaults against the German Army. This was one of George Patton's favored units.\nThe 761st Black Panthers whose motto was \"Come out Fighting\"Both Jamie and Ronsel carry the emotional scars of their combat. Both are decorated heroes. Jamie won the Distinguished Flying Cross flying B-24 Liberators. Ronsel rose to the rank of Tank Commander and has a chest full of medals. The experiences that haunt them bind them together as friends. But they are also bound by alcoholism to forget the nightmares of war.\nB-24 Liberator Heavy BomberBut we must remember this is Mississippi in the 1940s. Both men must deal with forbidden love. Jamie must handle his feelings for his brother's wife, Laura. Ronsel learns he has fathered a child by a German widow. Both Jamie and Ronsel must deal with the Ku Klux Klan. The final third of Jordan's novel speeds to a tumultuous conclusion. It is impossible to put this novel down until the final page is reached. There is a fine denoument awaiting the reader Jordan was born in Dallas, Texas, living there and in Muscogee, Oklahoma, until she attended Wellesley College. Her route to writing was a circuitous one. Jordan entered the world of advertising, and created a number of commercials featuring the Everready Bunny. Imagine that. Fortunately for readers of this novel, Jordan entered the MFA program in creative writing at Columbia University. Prior to its publication Mudbound won the prestigious Bellwether Prize for socially engaged fiction in 2008. The Prize was established by Barbara Kingsolver.Jordan is currently working on a sequel to Mudbound which picks up the action several years after the action in this work during the heart of the Civil Rights Movement.

Don't get me wrong, this was a great, action-packed book, but some parts were so violent and disturbing that I had to brace myself to read on. In the Delta, whites believed that they were better then their African American counterparts. The premise of the book was to explain the tension between races on the local scale, and how the war changed the way America worked. As a fellow Goodreads reader put it, \"I wish I could tell you what made me bring it home to read, but I honestly don't remember. Maybe it was the first paragraph.\" I fully agree with this statement. The first paragraph of the book sets the scene for the excellent level of writing that is soon to come in the pages ahead. \"Henry and I dug the hole seven feet deep. Any shallower and the corpse was liable to come rising up during the next big flood: Howdy boys! Remember me? The thought of it kept us digging even after the blisters on our palms had burst, reformed and burst again.\" The McAllans and the Jacksons were the sharecroppers who defined the books plot, and showed just how real this situation could be during that time. When Jamie, Henry McAllans brother, and Ronsel, the Jackson's child, came home from the war their relationship became the conflict. Ronsel, an African American soldier was changed by the war, because over there, skin color didn't matter. The only thing you worried about was staying alive. The dynamic of friendship between Jamie and Ronsel, and the unchanged racism of the Delta, made the book a great read.For every bit of fiction there was in Mudbound, there was true stories that connected the book to real life. World War 2 really did leave African Americans with a sense of pride in themselves that hadn't been there before. Europeans didn't have the same racism as America, and they didn't judge people based on skin color. Therefore, when men came home, they realized their full potential, and knew they had to make things different. In addition, lynching was sadly a common thing in this time. Just as Ronsel had gotten his tongue cut out, so many more true stories like his actually happened. I think this harsh reality is what made the book so bitter-sweet. On one hand, I got sucked up in the action of Mudbound, but on the other, I thought about the true elements of the book, and wished America's history could have been different. Overall, Mudbound was an eye-opening book that I would personally recommend. Anyone looking for a quick, yet substantially moving story, should definitely read this. The essence of this wonderful book can be captured in my favorite quote eloquently said by Ronsel.\"Should my story end there, in the back of that mule-drawn wagon? Silenced, delirious with pain and laudanum, defeated? Nobody would like that ending, least of all me. But to make the story come out differently I'd have to overcome so much: birth and education and opression, fear and deformity and shame, any one of which which is enough to defeat a man.\""}], "description": "In Jordan's prize-winning debut, prejudice takes many forms, both subtle and brutal. It is 1946, and city-bred Laura McAllan is trying to raise her children on her husband's Mississippi Delta farm - a place she finds foreign and frightening. In the midst of the family's struggles, two young men return from the war to work the land. Jamie McAllan, Laura's brother-in-law, is everything her husband is not - charming, handsome, and haunted by his memories of combat. Ronsel Jackson, eldest son of the black sharecroppers who live on the McAllan farm, has come home with the shine of a war hero. But no matter his bravery in defense of his country, he is still considered less than a man in the Jim Crow South. It is the unlikely friendship of these brothers-in-arms that drives this powerful novel to its inexorable conclusion. The men and women of each family relate their versions of events and we are drawn into their lives as they become players in a tragedy on the grandest scale. As Kingsolver says of Hillary Jordan, \"Her characters walked straight out of 1940s Mississippi and into the part of my brain where sympathy and anger and love reside, leaving my heart racing.
