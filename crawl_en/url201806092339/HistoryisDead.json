Some are funny, some disturbing and some just plain fun. I cannot even begin to say how much I liked just about every story in this book. The zombies may have been different in each story, and the tone too, but these were almost all solid, entertaining tales.That said, there were three that just kinda didn't work for me: (Warning, this part may contain spoilers)----------------------------------------------------------------------\"This Relunctant Prometheus\" had several problems -- it was a bit unclear in certain parts, the action developed too quickly and the title character did not seem relunctant at all. And why didn't the zombie mammoth attack the cavemen? \"Society and Sickness\" had great promise, written in a certain Victorian style, but was illogical at points. Why would the hero -- a young lady -- decide to take a rifle when her father went to check on the ill man she was courting? There was an explanation, but it was weak. And why would she know to shoot for the brain? Why would she know to prepare defenses for the family home and how, in god's name, did no one notice her digging ditches and dumping oil around the perimeter of the cottage? Seriously, it was all too convenient, which is a shame, because the writing was decent and the story premise had a lot of promise. Oh, and when the hero shoots the first zombie in the story, her father is not in the least worried that she will be arrested or imprisoned, bringing shame to the family, but that she won't get married? WTF?\"Hell Soldiers\" suffered from some unclear writing and from switching from a first-person story in the first few paragraphs to a third-person account. Odd. Probably a lack of editing, but it really hurt the story.But the rest of the collection was excellent."}, {"userName": "Patrick D'Orazio", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4328815-patrick-d-orazio", "userReview": "I typically avoid trying to review Anthologies, simply because I feel that each story deserves to be taken on its own merits. I have read most of the zombie anthologies out there and have enjoyed all of them...some have some stories that really knock my socks off while others are just interesting and creative. With the theme of history here, what we are served up is a dark menu of treats tied in with some of the major events in history. The Black Plague, the real genius behind the creation of Frankenstein, the great Chicago fire, etc. All of these events, along with several more personalized stories unrelated to figures of major historical prominence give us a tome of Alternative Histories that is quite intriguing. It is challenging, to say the least, to be knowledgeable enough of a time period and the details of how people lived to be able to embellish upon the known history effectively with the injection of the living dead. That each of these authors boldly ventured forth to do so here certainly shows both an appreciation for history and a willingness to stand it on its head for the purposes of macabre entertainment. From the start I have to say I really enjoyed the creative flare I saw with these stories-David Dunwoody's flashback to prehistory, Raoul Wainscoting's creative use of Shakespeare, Johnathan Maberry's creative take on a little fire in Chicago and most of the others had me grinning at the enthusiasm everyone had to come up with some really fun ideas. I think that a book like this could easily be expanded with future editions, if these authors and others are up to the task of coming up with even more tales from other areas of history. The source material is endless."}, {"userName": "Olivia R.

And why not, when believing is such bloody good fun?While at least half of the twenty stories found in History Is Dead take place in the past 200 years \u2013 with America and Europe proving popular settings \u2013 the rest stretch as far back as the Pleistocene epoch. (\u201cThis Reluctant Prometheus,\u201d in which members of the homo ergaster species become infected with zombie-ism after consuming an infected wooly mammoth, is one of my favorites.) Zombies are credited for bringing humans the gift of fire, rescuing a Viking kingdom from insurrection, inspiring budding horror author Mary Shelly, and administering vigilante justice to Jack the Ripper. They appear on Civil War battlefields and in East End slums. They infiltrate the United States government in their quest for gooooold. (An \u201cIndian\u201d curse gone weird. Don\u2019t ask.) The Great Fire of Chicago? Started by zombies, the first of which was created when Biela\u2019s Comet rained a mysterious green rock onto (and into) Pat \u201cPaddy\u201d O\u2019Leary\u2019s Aunt Sophie. Zombies, it seems, are all around us.As always, anthologies are difficult to review, since you\u2019re apt to take a shining to some pieces more than others. Overall, History Is Dead is a quick, enjoyable, entertaining read \u2013 perfect for a morbid Saturday afternoon at the beach. I polished it off in under a week, which is near-record speed for me. Though they share a common theme, each story in this collection is unique. In some, zombies make a brief, even ancillary cameo \u2013 while in others they serve as the story\u2019s protagonists. A bloody, gory, over-the-top collection of shoot-\u2018em-up zombie tales this is not. In fact, it could be argued that zombies aren\u2019t even the scariest monsters to be found within the pages of HISTORY IS DEAD. Take, for example, \u201cJunebug\u201d \u2013 which comes with a major trigger warning \u2013 in which a preacher (at the End Times Church, natch) uses the looming zombie apocalypse as a pretense to sexually enslave one of his young parishioners (June or \u201cJunebug\u201d of the story\u2019s title). After several months of living with him \u2013 with her parents\u2019 permission, ostensibly to babysit his children due to his wife\u2019s illness \u2013 she becomes pregnant from the repeated rapes. Cast out by the preacher, she finds no solace from her family, as they blame her for \u201cseducing\u201d her rapist. June and her sole defender, brother Ethan, ultimately meet a gory end \u2013 and yet, even at their \u201cworst,\u201d the reader has more sympathy for the zombie siblings than for their human victims. I found a similar pleasure in \u201cAwake in the Abyss,\u201d which finds Jack the Ripper\u2019s \u201ccanonical five\u201d victims - Mary Ann Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddowes, and Mary Jane Kelly - along with a sixth woman, narrator Nelly, awakening from the grave in order to avenge their deaths\u2026as only zombies can. I bet you never thought you\u2019d find yourself rooting so enthusiastically for the zombies, eh?http://www.easyvegan.info/2012/07/16/..."}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/790543-matt", "userReview": "History Is Dead is a collection of stories about zombies throughout history. Similar to the Recorded Attacks section in The Zombie Survival Guide (or I supposed the subsequent The Zombie Survival Guide: Recorded Attacks - which I haven't read), but not told in the same fact-like technical manner. The stories are unconnected, and the 'rules' story-to-story are unspecific.If you want to be specific, (and I do) you wouldn't classify all the creatures in these stories as zombies. I'm not strictly speaking from a \"is it a Romero zombie, or a Russo zombie\" point of view. But rather, a more specific term for a lot of the creatures in this book would be undead.Regardless, I found the majority of the stories in this collection entertaining. Notably, History wouldn't be one I'd recommend to gore fans. Though it has it's moments, a fair few of the stories feature the undead as secondary characters, or a merely a consequence. I can see how this might not sit well with some people. But it's alright with me."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3361474-jennifer", "userReview": "History is Dead stumbles along, getting by on its awesome concept (Civil War zombies? sign me up! Black Plague as zombie contagion? YES!) but largely failing to deliver any kind of real bite. Most of the stories are middling at best, a few so weak as to be laughable, and all are poorly edited. Some of the authors attempt to distact the reader with shiny historical cameos, to varying degrees of success. (The Rembrandt story actually almost works, from sheer cheek. On the other hand, the Shakespeare rip-off...well, there is a great Shakespearean zombie story to be written. This simply isn't it.)

The dead cannot use tools, because they cannot think. They cannot speak for the same reason. And this is a strictly human condition - animals cannot become members of the undead community.

I do enjoy fresh perspectives on zombies and zombie origin stories, though, so I can't be too harsh. Society and Sickness was almost a direct condensed ripoff of Pride Prejudice and Zombies.

They emerge from foggy cemeteries, frozen barrows, loamy bogs, cursed mines, and gore-spattered operating rooms to prey on the living. But these zombies don't just eat people. They help painters and writers save their faltering careers. They unwittingly push humankind on the quest for fire. They topple evil capitalists and their corporate empires. They fight crime.
