I can see why. This is a professionally written, emotionally satisfying zombie tale carried away with a light touch that emphasizes character over splatter.A twenty-one-year-old white female wakes up in a hospital with zero recollection of how she came to be there. Confronted by a nurse with a serious attitude problem, the girl has the impression she was involved in a car accident, but is notified she suffered a near-fatal drug overdose and was found by cops on the side of a road. Naked. Her interrogation begins with the nurse asking her if she even knows her name.\"Yeah, I know my damn name,\" I snarled. \"It's Angel Crawford.\" I wanted to add, And you can write it down with that pencil that's stuck up your ass, but I managed to hold it back. I knew that nurses had the power to make your life suck worse than it already did, and it was clear that this bitch considered me to be one step away from starring in my own loser reality show. Screw her. I was at least two steps away.Angel discovers a package waiting for her at the nurse's station. A cooler contains six unlabeled bottles of a brown, opaque beverage. A note instructs her to drink one bottle every other day or risk becoming very sick. She's informed that there's a job waiting for her at the Coroner's Office. Angel is warned that if she fails to hold onto the job for a month, her toxicology results will be shared with her probation officer and she'll go straight to jail.Angel lives in Nice, a town pinned in the southeast corner of Louisiana by swamp. She shares a sad excuse for a home with her widowed father, a bitter drunk who crawled into a Jack Daniels bottle five years ago after the suicide of Angel's mother. Angel has an on-again/ off-again boyfriend named Randy who she remembers arguing with the night of her blackout at Pillar's Bar, but after trading the bartender a couple of joints for a Percocet, Angel's memory gets foggy.She discovers that the job waiting for her is van driver, dispatched by the parish to transport dead bodies to the morgue for autopsy. No one at the coroner's office offers clues as to how Angel got this job or who is looking out for her. She's shown the ropes by cocky pre-med student Nick Galatas, who torments Angel by revealing she's to assist the kindly parish forensic pathologist Dr. Leblanc in autopsies. Angel dropped out of high school the day of frog dissection, but to her surprise, not only seems unaffected by the activities of the morgue, but finds herself getting hungry around them.As Angel builds confidence on the job, she meets a variety of characters. There's her partner Derrel Cusimano, a death investigator who used to play linebacker for LSU. There's a sheriff's deputy named Marcus Ivanov who under normal circumstances might be kinda hot, but Angel recognizes as the cop who arrested her for auto theft. Ed Quinn is a paramedic who worked on Angel when she overdosed and is a childhood pal of Marcus'. Monica Gaudreau is a death investigator, who later helps Angel piece together events on the night she overdosed.Her supply of energy drinks running out, Angel receives an anonymous note urging her If you crave it, eat it. Unable to stop craving brains, Angel comes to the conclusion that she's a zombie. This is verified by one of her kind, a funeral parlor driver named John Kang who confronts Angel about the deceased he's picking up from the morgue missing their brains. Kang appears to be Angel's age but in reality, is old enough to be her father. He's aloof and wary that Angel will cut in on his business selling brains to a zombie clientele. In Diana Rowland's ghoulish but off-beat vision, zombies are \"turned\" with a bite from the infected, but rather than turn into mindless flesh eating machines, maintain their regular lives as long as they mix fresh brains into their diet. Failure to do so results in hunger that can turn a zombie \"rogue\", as well as exhibit a putrid odor and ultimately, the loss of body parts. On the plus side, wounds heal quickly and a feast on fresh brains summons what Angel describes as zombie superpowers: increased strength and agility.My Life As a White Trash Zombie completely charmed me. Rather than a bizarro take on zombie activity or something that MAD Magazine might've whipped up for laughs, this is a real novel. Rowland is more interested in the transformation of Angel Crawford, a woman at a dead end who's given a new lease on life. Angel starts a new job, meets interesting people and stumbles onto a mystery which her new powers give her the capacity to solve. In the process, she discovers self-respect.I stood back while Derrel shared my observations with the detective. Abadie scowled and peered at the underside of the tractor, then muttered something vile. I almost felt sorry for him. Handling an accidental death was a walk in the park next to dealing with a possible homicide. The procedures didn't change much, but the attention to detail went several notches up. And if he hadn't been a dickwad I probably would've felt sorry for him. As it was, I allowed myself a perverse sense of satisfaction. Hey, I never claimed to be an angel.Rowland earns points for introducing racial and sexual diversity to her cast of characters and for incorporating a variety of social issues into the story in what feels like an organic way. Rather than spending the novel battling creatures, Angel struggles with drugs and alcohol, domestic violence, sexual assault and unfulfilled relationships. The novel is laden with profanity and chock full of corpses, but the violence is not explicit and the sexual content is handled in a very discriminate, tasteful way. The novel has sturdy construction too. Like a foundation of wet cement, Rowland pours on the intrigue. I was curious to find out what happened to Angel the night of her blackout, who turned her into a zombie and why. That cement gets harder and harder as the story progresses and by the climax, turns into a bridge that ties everything together. Rowland never once bored or confused me. I actually found myself falling in love with Angel, even if she'd probably look at me and wonder why some old guy was staring at her and about to get his ear bitten off.Four and a half stars rounded up to five. I can't think of anything that Rowland might've done differently to make this novel better than it turned out. The superlative cover art is by Dan dos Santos, who in this interview indicated he was working his way through trailer park and lawn flamingo motifs when he hit upon a pink background contrasted with the gray skin of Angel Crawford. For once, the book inside lives up to the cover."}, {"userName": "Sh3lly \u2694 tired of damaged heroines \u2694", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25393430-sh3lly-tired-of-damaged-heroines", "userReview": "It's Zombiefest July with my freaky girls in the MacHalo group!Angel Crawford is a loser and not the sharpest crayon in the box.

I absolutely loved this audiobook. I found this book during one of audible's sales a few months ago and bought it on a whim. I just hoped that it would be a fun quirky story to go along with its attention grabbing title and awesome pick cover. I was instantly hooked with this one. I started this audiobook while I was doing the laundry one Sunday night and I actually found myself spending a lot more time than usual folding clothes just because I didn't want the story to stop. Anything that can make me want to do laundry deserves a medal of some kind. I really haven't had this much fun listening to an audiobook in a long time.I love a good zombie story. I will have to blame The Walking Dead for that I guess. These stories are just so much fun and I like how varied each one can be. Angel is really my kind of zombie. She doesn't throw herself a pity party when she realizes that she is a zombie. She just tries her best to figure out what she needs to do in order to take care of herself. Angel is smart and I really liked the way she thinks about things so spending time in her head was great.The mystery of this book really took a backseat to the wonderful characters for me. There were really two mysteries in the book. The main focus seemed to be about a series of deaths in the area but I found myself really wanting to find out what had happened that made Angel into a zombie. That was the big question in my mind and I was satisfied with the outcome. I really liked the flow of the story. The pace that things were revealed was just right to keep me very interested. It was a very well rounded book for me as well. I wouldn't say that this book was laugh out loud funny but there were some moments of humor that I really enjoyed. Angel's realization about what she is and what she wants was just a lot of fun. She also shows a lot of growth during the book which was well done.I loved the narration of this audiobook. Allison McLemore did an absolutely fabulous job of bringing life to this story. I am so glad that I went with the audio on this one because I can't imagine a better way to experience this story. I loved the voices that she used for all of the characters and her southern accent really was perfect for the story. I would definitely like to listen to more books narrated by this narrator and plan to continue with the series very soon. I would highly recommend this book to others. I had a great time listening to it and would recommend to others to try it on audio if they have a chance. This is the first book by Diana Rowland that I have read and I can't wait to see what else she can come up with. It looks like I will be purchasing the remaining audiobooks in this series very soon because I need to spend more time with Angel as soon as possible.Initial ThoughtsI absolutely loved this one!

What more do you need to know?\"I loved this book, I thought the different take on zombies was really cool.Angel Crawford has the unfortunate opportunity to find out what it's like to be a zombie trying to exist in the real world. She wakes up in the hospital not knowing what happened to her. They say she overdosed on pills, but when I found out what happened at the end I wanted to put the beat down on someone! Lets just say she was in the wrong place with the wrong person at the wrong time. Anyhoo, so she's left a lunchbox with some funky looking stuff blended up in jars saying that she needs to drink one a day. Needless to say she doesn't know what is going on and it's nasty as all get out. Uggg... I don't think you will find a brain smoothie at Dairy Queen. Gag a maggot! Now that that is out of my system, Angel is so confused as you would be. She can't even remember what happened to her until later. She also has to take a job at the morgue for the drug charge. Now Angel has a very weak stomach and can't understand why the site of the autopsies are not making her sick and holy crow what is that delicious aroma. Who knew a brain could smell so good! After awhile she finds out she's a zombie and can luckily get brains from the morgue. She has to deal with other zombies wanting brains, other zombies being brain lords dealing in selling brains. Really? And she's also learning a lot from this hot cop that she keeps running into. She is learning in a sense to become a zombie detective, which helps out when she has to find out who is now killing zombies! I think this was a really cool mystery/zombie book. I look forward to reading the other books!"}, {"userName": "Anelis", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5134195-anelis", "userReview": "This was my first Diana Rowland book, so I had no expectations whatsoever. I'm not going to describe the plot nor write spoilers.Before reading the book I LOVED it's cover. In fact I picked it up solely because of it's cool pink zombie cover. I mean look at it! It's pink, with a beautiful woman, piercings, blood, don't-give-a-damn look...what's not to like? But I must admit it, again because of the cover I didn't expect it to be any good. I was just in the mood for a bad paranormal romance novel as my weekly guilty pleasure that also happened to have a cover I enjoyed looking at. A book that would be fun but badly written. A B-Movie type of book.Now that I finished not only this but also the second book in the series I can say that the cover is definitely they worst part of the book. I wish it was different because it doesn't represent the content and makes it look \"cheaper\" than it actually is.Am I making sense?The novel is written in a first person perspective, which means that we get a lot of \"telling\" instead of \"showing\". The protagonist seems very real and Rowland has not tried to do her any favors in order to score points with the readers. She is a white trash girl with a melodramatic story that manages to balance between being moving and cheesy pretty well. The romance part is barely visible, which is one of the things I loved in this book. I was really afraid that it was going to be like the Parasole Protectorate series (too much fuss about a mystery we don't really care about because we all know it's just a pretense to hide the fact that the main theme is the romantic story). But thankfully it wasn't. The romance was not an end in itself but a natural and logical sequence of the events that took place. It wasn't the main focus of the novel either. The focal storyline was a mystery! Ok it was a weak mystery (the second novel Even White Trash Zombies Get the Blues almost excels in that department) but it was fun!I read that Diana Rowland has worked as a morgue assistant, detective, crime scene investigator etc and IT SHOWS! This was one of the most pleasant things in the book. I just began reading Married With Zombies, where the couple says that they'll use zombie movies as a reference material to fight the undead and it made me chuckle because Rowland does the exact opposite. She describes, through the eyes of Angel -her protagonist- how everything is different from the tv-shows and movies, less glamorous and more real. That constant note of realism throughout the novel makes it even more exciting and even rubs off some of it onto the whole...zombie thing. And now that I finally came to the zombies let me say this: I HATE it when they make zombies smart. I am a huge zombie fan and I want my zombies brainless dammit! I have read stuff that try to have a new take on the zombie thing and utilize smart zombies, like Warm Bodies but I could only see it (the fact that they are capable of coherent thought) as a lazy attempt to make the zombie protagonist be eligible as a romantic interest. Imagine my surprise when I realized that the smart zombies of this book didn't bother me one bit! Of course this wasn't a random occurrence. It happened thanks to the fairly plausible bits of explanation that exist throughout the novel (as Angel slowly realizes what she has become) tied in with the more thorough one of what the zombie \"virus\" really is, which is explained in the 2nd book Even White Trash Zombies Get the Blues. This doesn't mean that there aren't a lot of hints in this one, there are. However, in the 2nd book we also get to have a medical explanation. It doesn't delve too deep in the subject like Mira Grant's Newsflesh Trilogy does, but it's satisfying and looks, at least to me, well though out.In conclusion: I liked this one. It was fun, exciting, had intelligent parts realistic information and even an honest attempt in character development. It was much more than I expected when I first picked it up. I can't wait for the 3rd book to come out.PS.The audiobook has the most redneck sounding narrator EVER and it's FUN!"}, {"userName": "Heidi", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5463965-heidi", "userReview": "Five stars: Immediately purchase and devour this book. It is awesome! A whole new take on zombies. Fresh and hysterically funny. Don't miss this one!What I loved about this book:*Angel, she rocks! There are so many aspects of her character that I found captivating. First is her transformation. Angel starts the story as trailer trash. She is plagued with an alcohol and pill problem, she cannot hold down a job, she has an abusive, alcoholic father with whom she lives in a run down dump of a house with a beer can driveway. When Angel wakes up in the hospital after an apparent overdose, unbeknowst to her she has already started to change. Angel was turned into a zombie but she has no knowledge of the event As a zombie she is a normal functioning human except she needs to eat brains every two to three days to prevent herself from decaying. Her new zombie state helps her shed the chemical dependency. Then she begins to excel at and even enjoy her new job at the morgue. All of these factors convert Angel to a happy, contributing member of society. The beauty of Angel, is that evolving into a zombie improves her status instead of reducing her to the moaning, crazed, non-functioning creature that we attribute to this genre.*The book has three storylines; Angel's evolvement and two distinct mysteries. The first story thread is for her to learn and adapt to her new zombie condition while trying to discover how and why she was converted into a zombie. The second plot involves Angel seeking the indentity of the person who infected her. Whoever transfigured Angel leaves only a couple of cryptic letters with clues to her metamorphisis. This person also secures her position at the morgue where she has access to essential brains. The third storyline follows Angel as she tracks down the individual responsible for killing and beheading people. Is it another zombie? These three themes all converge to make a great story. I particularly enjoyed the mysterious aspect of the book.*This book is truly hysterically funny. I snickered and laughed at Angel's sarcastic banter. There is one specific commentary regarding Angel's views on people saying \"if you ever need anything don't hesitate to ask\", in Angel's mind people should be offering to come and clean your kitchen instead of making these disingenuous statements. This snarky commentary is what makes the book. It is indeed laugh out loud funny!And the not so much:*The morgue setting and all the descriptions of autopsy and embalming procedures while tactfully done might be a little over the top for some readers. As well as all the slurping and ingesting of brains. Don't let this deter you. This book is totally worth it!*I wanted more resolution between Angel and her father. Angel progresses so far in her character development I felt that this was a key aspect that was not realized. Perhaps their relationship will continue on the road to recovery in future installments.*I wish there was a little more background information into the zombie condition. Ms. Rowland's zombies are not your typical zombies. It would be beneficial to be further educated in her ideas of \"zombieism\" .I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was funny, snarky, unique and just a good time. The cover alone is worth the price of admission. I was thrilled to learn that this is the start of a new series. I am excited to see where Angel and her new found Zombie Super Powers will lead her. In my opinion this is a must read! Get it today and put it on the top of your TBR pile and be prepared to laugh your butt off! Then when you are done can you come and clean my kitchen?!"}, {"userName": "Michelle, the Bookshelf Stalker  Queen of the Undead", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3039709-michelle-the-bookshelf-stalker-queen-of-the-undead", "userReview": "I went back and forth from 3 stars to 4 stars.

I think book 2 is going to rock though and I really love Angel and someone else that is revealed at the very end of the book (yeah, I'm so excited for book 2 to see what happens with this character).As for the boredom, I think Rowland was just trying to establish Angel's identity as a zombie. I do think it was necessary as Angel was a pretty fucked up human so switching to a zombie, is not easy. If Rowland didn't go through the trials and tribulations, the book wouldn't be convincing.Oh and the stuff with the dad, very realistic (I should know). I liked that (not the situation that Angel was in but that Rowland made it so real).So even though it is \"just\" 3.5 stars, I'm super happy excited for book 2!"}, {"userName": "Carol.

You won't be disappointed. I liked Angel Crawford a lot. I rooted for her every single moment. She starts as a walking stereotype (that title is a dead giveaway), but she grows into something much more. The author took a stereotype and used it in the best way possible. Angel's life is pretty messed up. But by the end of the book, I even felt sorry for her father (a bit). As for the ending, that was satisfying.And another thing, even though My Life as a White Trash Zombie starts this series, it doesn't end with a cliffhanger. It doesn't need one.

Something about these characters make me excited to read their stories and cheer them on because they deserve a happy ending too! :) Angel Crawford is a perfect example of the obstacles an individual with addictions, and an  Fucked up  abusive alcoholic father, a mother that committed suicide while incarcerated struggle have to overcome while attempting keep her sanity.Angel Crawford is hilariously funny, lovable, self depricating, kind hearted, witty, empatic, and generous  Zombie  woman. She's tough and she's not afraid to stand up for herself. Since becoming a Zombie, Angel is succeeding at becoming a \"better\" person, and taking control of her life in a positive manner.  No she's not running back to high school to get her G.E.D. or rescuing orphaned children from a burning bus, but she  IS working hard at being dependable and valuable to her employer at her  New job at the countymorgue...because....Well let's face it; Her life depends on it For me that's \"good\" enough because I Loved Angel.Randy her  Asshole, Piece of Shit, Dead Beat, Drug Pusher  On again/Off again Loser BF can't stand the thought of Angel actually being relieved of her drug addictions, calling her a \"goody two shoes\" it's obvious that misery  Does love company. Shes way too good for him! She has a new surrounding of friends in her life due to her job at the morgue, and all are rooting for the new and improved self respecting Angel. I actually really liked them all, surprisingly. However there's a hunky detective named Marcus Ivankov that treats Angel with kindness and respect even though he arrested her the previous summer, that Angel is deeply crushing on and I'll admit, I am too.;)To sum up this new refreshingly unique character in a nut shell: Angel the previous year purchased a \"slightly\" used Toyota Prius for $500.00. She thought it sounded like a pretty awesome deal, until she's arrested for possession of stolen goods and now is on felony probation. Yes she  really  is that naive. LOL Just when you think you you have your suspicions confirmed about whom the killer is and/or the identity of Angel's Zombie maker you soon discover you're wrong! I loved the element of mystery and Diana Rowland achieved it up until the end. All of the sudden it seemed as if I could smell the brain, andnot in a  oh-how-gross way, but as if someone had taken the lid off a pot of gumbo to let the aroma fill the room. And I knew it was the brain that smelled so utterly enticing, knew with every single cell of my being. What the  Hell  was wrong with me??!

Really, 10 days is such a long time! I could have saved myself the trouble, though, buying it once was more than enough. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a bad book, I can\u2019t even find anything seriously wrong with it, I just didn\u2019t care about Angel or her story that much. My other problem is that it wasn\u2019t funny at all. Rowland probably spoiled me with her Kara Gillian series which, despite being a police procedural, has its moments of hilarity. Things that were probably meant to be cute and/or funny in My Life as a White Trash Zombie were mostly just over the top and annoying. I\u2019m asking you to take my review with a grain of salt. I haven\u2019t been in the right mood for urban fantasy lately and that might have something to do with my opinion of this book. Diana Rowland is still one of my favorite urban fantasy authors and I fully intend to read everything she writes in the future."}, {"userName": "Bark", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2905339-bark", "userReview": "3 1/2 starsI have wanted to read this book ever since I first saw the fabulous cover on someone\u2019s blog. It\u2019s really eye catching, isn't it? Talk about a lucky author. And best of all, it fits its main character Angel perfectly. Well, I finally made time to read it and, uh, I\u2019m glad I did but I didn't expect it to take nearly a month to get through. The book starts out when Angel wakes up in the hospital with no recollection of how she ended up there. She's told she overdosed and she figures it could have happened, she really is no angel, and though she vaguely remembers a crash she isn't injured. As she's making haste to get home, she's given a bag with a note and a cooler filled with bottles of some sort of chunky goo. The note explains that she is being offered a job at the morgue and that she must accept it, as well as drink the goo, OR ELSE. She sees this as a bit of good luck since she\u2019s a self-professed loser and screw-upper and decides to follow the demands of the anonymous letter. What the hell, her life can't get any worse right? Angel drinks the bottled \u201cshakes\u201d and realizes it's pretty good, if a wee bit chunky and meaty tasting. At the morgue, she realizes she's going to be driving around dead bodies and assisting in autopsies. It skeeves her out at first but like the shakes, she realizes she enjoys it, especially when she sniffs her first human brain and her stomach starts growling. What is going on? Even though the title does kind of give away the game, I\u2019ll let you guess. So basically the rest of the book follows Angel as she struggles with her new and improved self (the shakes make her feel good, enhance her senses a little and make her stronger), meets some interesting guys, deals with her drunken dad, gets embroiled in a decapitation mystery and gets past her white trash upbringing and realizes life may just have something to offer other than booze, drugs and horrible boyfriends. She grows up quite a bit during this book. Yay Angel. Angel's voice is sarcastic and self-deprecating, she\u2019s funny and she\u2019s crabby and sometimes she\u2019s a defensive bitch but she\u2019s also an optimist who takes all of the changes in her life in stride. I liked her a lot. Despite her rough upbringing she still has a soft heart and her relationships are complicated and believable. She doesn't blame her mistakes on the world and isn't a poor me type. She knows she\u2019s a mess and knows that a lot of it is entirely her own fault.But alas, something is off with the pacing and parts of the book are soooo draggy with very little going on that I literally had to force myself to keep going. I\u2019m glad I did because the ending is satisfying and answers many of the questions that came up while reading. But again, it took me nearly 3 weeks to finish a 310 page book so I can\u2019t rate it as highly as I\u2019d like to. I think if you\u2019re looking for a fun (albeit sometimes slow) zombie tale with edgy charm, decently drawn characters, a wee bit of gore and zero sappiness you\u2019ll find a lot to like here."}, {"userName": "Yodamom", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2905141-yodamom", "userReview": "Fun zombie tale with a snarkish troubled main character.

Not only was it entertaining but it was also deeper and had a bigger impact than I was expecting!Angel is such an amazing character! She's flawed, human (or...sort of being a zombie but you know what I mean). She's had a rough life. Her and her dad live in a trailer with her father's beer bottles littering the driveway. The abuse is from him to her. Her mother wasn't much better but is no longer around. I don't know how to adequately describe it all but suffice it to say she hasn't had it easy. She dropped out of high school, got addicted to pills, has issues from the way her father treats her and not really knowing how to be a grown up because no one was there to teach her life skills.She goes through a lot of character development through-out the novel. She nearly dies and would have if she hadn't been turned into a zombie, essentially giving her a second chance. She gets a job at a morgue, which she doesn't understand why at first or how but it eventually becomes clear. She has to learn how to grow up if she is to survive. She's 21.This book shows the effects of abuse and it never condones or normalizes it. She learns that she doesn't deserve that crap and learns how to stand up for herself. She's a caring person, realistically flawed, and she really grows into herself and is a strong character (and i'm not talking the hyped up on brains zombie strength). Angel is my favorite part about this book! I loved the entire thing though.The plot was interesting and had me wanting to read on and know more, the writing sucked me in, the pacing was steady and picked up even more in the second half. I was never bored. I cried multiple times, I hugged the book and I squealed with joy. It made me think and at times hit really close to home for me. This story truly gave me all the feels! There are well written characters, interesting zombies, mystery and feels wrapped up in a bad-ass fast paced package!If it sounds at all interesting to you i'd highly recommend giving this story a read!

I\u2019ve been totally missing out. There\u2019s a major plus side that came out of waiting though. That\u2019s right, I now have several to read at my leisure. High five, bitches!Okay, so technically I didn\u2019t read it. Nope. I listened to My Life as a White Trash Zombie on audio, and it was fantastic! I\u2019m just now really getting into audiobooks on a more regularly, and I\u2019m pretty damn picky when it comes to narrators. So, I was beyond delighted to discover Allison McLemore kicks narration ass! She does great accents, is clear and natural, and truly becomes the characters. I had very happy ears.I love zombies! Always have and always will. This, however, is not your typical zombie book. It\u2019s more in the urban fantasy genre than horror. I know, weird, right? Believe me, it\u2019s actually really freaking cool.Listen, Angel isn\u2019t exactly on a very good path in life. She\u2019s 21, living in a trailer with her alcoholic dad, dropped out of school at 16, drinks, pops pills, and all that other fun stuff. Pretty much just wasting her life away. Then shit hits the fan one night and she awakes as a zombie. Only she isn\u2019t quite privy to that information at first. In fact, she doesn\u2019t even remember the prior night. Thus, a mystery is born.Angel is quite a character! Don\u2019t judge her on all that crap above, because this chick is caring, smarter than she thought, and funny as hell. She shows tremendous growth. I absolutely love the irony of her situation and that she doesn\u2019t waste her second chance at life. Undead life? You know what I mean. And the secondary characters are great, too! It was really nice to see the impact they made on her life and helped her evolve without even knowing it. I'm looking forward to more of all of them.I was so engrossed in the story. There were several times I had to tell people to stop talking to me because I didn\u2019t want to pause it. The mystery was great and handled very well. I\u2019ll be honest, I tend to be a bit critical when it comes to law enforcement and crime scenes in books. It drives me nuts when it\u2019s obvious the author didn\u2019t do very much research on how it all works, if any at all. Even small details make my eye twitch. As I read\n My Life as a White Trash Zombie,\n I found myself increasingly impressed. I figured the author must have background in this area because it\u2019s so well done. So I wasn\u2019t all that surprised to discover that yes, Diana Rowland does have real life experience. And I will tell you, it shows. It brought the whole book up several notches, in my opinion.Seriously, even if you aren\u2019t exactly into the zombie scene, give this a try. It\u2019s definitely a kick ass twist on the whole undead thing, and extremely entertaining. Plus, look at the covers of this series.

Angel\u2019s name doesn\u2019t suit her; she\u2019s a drug addict who pops pills. She had a dead-end on again/off again boyfriend who isn\u2019t any much better. She dropped out of high school years ago & has a criminal record. Can you tell Angel has everything going for her?Angel wakes up in the ER after an overdose, but she swears she was in a horrible car crash..yet there\u2019s not a mark on her. To add to the \u201cwhat the hell\u201d, she receives an anonymous letter saying she has to show up at the parish coroners office, there is a job waiting there for her. If she refuses, she goes to jail. Lovely.Angel gets her arse into gear & turns up at the coroners office, where she finds herself in the middle of a case. All the victims are turning up without heads, which sucks when you\u2019ve just worken up with an intense craving for brains & are pretty sure you didn\u2019t eat them.\u201cThat\u2026is a zombie, I silently shrieked to myself. Holy F-ing s#$t. That\u2019s a motherf-ing zombie, and this s#$t is real.\u201dAs soon as I saw the cover for White Trash Zombie, I knew I had to have it. After reading it I can tell you, Diana Rowland does not disappoint. I alternated between hysterical laughing & trying not to quote lines from the book on Twitter. Angel kicks ass! She transforms from trailer park girl to a girl who knows that it doesn\u2019t matter how much money you have, it\u2019s how you act & how much you respect your surroundings & yourself. I know, weird for a zombie right?I can hear a lot of people wondering, \u201cHow can I relate to a zombie?\u201d Trust me. You will love Angel! She\u2019s not the \u201ctypical\u201d zombie, she isn\u2019t a salivating beast (all the time), parts of her aren\u2019t constantly falling off (okay, only when she\u2019s starving) & she doesn\u2019t eat people (only their brains, when their dead). What do you want from her, she\u2019s a zombie! I loved the growth in Angel, it\u2019s amazing that Mrs. Rowland wrote a zombie with growth.That right there is what makes this such a unique book! But Angel really is a likeable character, so much so, she\u2019s now on my list of all time favorite characters.\u201cDeath wasn\u2019t fair. Death didn\u2019t give warning. Death hit nice people and nasty people. It didn\u2019t give a shit.Speaking of characters, there are all sorts! I loved Kang. He works for the local funeral home & is an Asian goth, chains & all. But I adored the hot detective, Marcus! Marcus has had previous dealings with Angel, but never once does he outwardly judge her. And he has a lot of ammo to judge Angel for. There are so many twists in this book, my head spun ala exorcist. I had NO idea who the bad person was & was totally shocked with the outcome. SHOCKED.Yes, there is brain eating people but it\u2019s funny & it\u2019s not as graphic as it could be. Think CSI meets brain smoothies & you\u2019ll be fine. And for the record, Mrs. Rowland knows her morgues, she\u2019s a former crime scene investigator & morgue attendant! Thus you get the \u201creal\u201d, this isn\u2019t all make believe people. You\u2019ll learn some facts you wish you didn\u2019t know (keep the bottom of the casket closed).I swear to you, there are so many lines in this book I wanted to quote. WTZ is a treasure trove of quote goodness! Diana Rowland has outdone herself, I laughed though about 85% of WTZ! \u201cCause I\u2019m starving \u2018yo\u201d is officially my new favorite line, I will use it in every single sentence I can. Among a ton of other one liners that had me laughing late into the night.Then I couldn\u2019t resist. I took a deep breath and yelled: \u201cZombie Super Powers, Activate!\u201dDiana Rowland has a way with words that used normally, would have people grossed right out but she manages to make you laugh. That\u2019s the bonus of this book, it isn\u2019t all brains! Mrs. Rowland has managed to makes zombies fun & intelligent, who would have thunk it? She made brain eaters cool! Fans of humorus urban fantasy, regardless of their zombie issues, have to give WTZ a try. Please.

But still!!!Ive been putting off reading this for probably four years. \"Diana, I love you more than lasagna, but there is no way I am reading your zombie crap.\" My curiosity finally wore me down, and I am so happy it did! The story is basically a cop-styled jaunt written with a huge wink and a grin. Our hero, the novice crime fighter, really isn't even a cop but a lowly van driver for the coroner's office. And when I say lowly, I mean low. She is a pill-popping, pot head, drop-out who shares a filthy home with her alcoholic dad. Dying was the most positive thing to happen in her life. But she pulls herself together (zombie pun!) and starts to feel self respect for the first time. She no longer needs pills or pot or her worthless boyfriend. The girl just needs some brainpower!Some of the scenes in the book come across as very real, and that is because the author snatched them from actual experiences from her glory days. Except the eating of brains. I think. o_OThis is a romp of a book, a totally fun break from my usual literary preferences.

All that changes one night when Angel wakes up in a hospital after what she believes was a severe bender. She can't recall what happened, but a mysterious note tells her that a job as the driver for the local coroner's office is hers and that she has to drink a series of mysterious shakes every other day for the next few weeks.Angel takes the job at the coroner's office and to her surprise finds that she's not repulsed by the cadavers. Instead, she's suddenly found an iron stomach and a strange fascination with brains. Turns out Angel has been turned into a zombie. But if she eats a brain every day or so, she won't rot--in fact, she can regenerate wounds fairly quickly with the help of a tasty brain or two. What Angel doesn't know is who the mysterious benefactor is who changed her to zombie, the hierarchy of the local zombie community for distributing brains to snack on and whether or not a serial killer is targeting the local zombie population.With a title like My Life As a White Trash Zombie, this novel was hard to pass up in the bookstore. It sounded like a lot of fun--and the story does have its moments. Angel is likeable enough to help keep the plot moving forward, though there is some initial frustration because we know from the title what's happened to Angel while she's still piecing it all together.

It takes a simple concept and slowly evolves over the course of the book in how brains are obtained, what happens when zombies eat them and how it affects them. Angel Crawford is so self deprecating, honest with herself on her short comings and somehow being turned into a zombie has turned her life around. She learns a lot about her limits and what she's capable of as well as how she should be treated in her \"loser\" life. There's also an underlying mystery aspect to the novel, of the seemingly random murders that crop up over town, with Angel appearing at the scene of the crime - partly because of her job at the morgue and her obsession with crime TV shows. Everything gets tied together in the end - with a great resolution of the murder mystery and of Angel's life. Such a fun, fresh entry into the zombie genre!

Really good, even.I say \"surprisingly\" because, let's face it, urban fantasy isn't aging well. At all. Especially when it comes to that segment of the genre written by women for women (or at least marketed as such. You know what I'm talking about: Kick-Ass Chick mercilessly kills her way around a monster-infested world only to turn all mushy and hormonal after meeting Mysteriously Brooding or Broodingly Mysterious Handsome Demon/Angel/Vampire/Were/Whatever). And this book was first published in 2011, which in uf years means it's almost a century old. Also, I saw some pretty awful reviews around for Diana Rowland's other series, Kara Gillian, so. And, finally, artist Daniel dos Santos and his scrumptilicious illustrations have been known to lead me to read some frankly terrible stuff, so now I'm super wary of what his magic might be covering up (hah!).So anyway: psyched to read My Life As a White Trash Zombie I was not. And yet read it I did, because the thought that all the good uf is behind me already is too painful for me to contemplate - and so I persevere. And, what do you know, this time I scored a little gem. Now, My Life As a White Trash Zombie is certainly no game-changer for the genre, Diana Rowland isn't the most wildly imaginative author around and dos Santos' cover did promise an edgy story that simply isn't there. But this turned out to be a thoroughly enjoyable read nonetheless.The book essentially tells the tale of Angel's strenuous efforts to walk away from the corner where a harsh life and her own attitude have backed her into: of redneckish background, with a mentally-ill and abusive mother and an alcoholic and equally violent father, Angel never really had a fair chance. After her mother commits suicide, Angel drops out of high school and gives up on life, aimlessly drifting through it while drinking and taking pills with her boyfriend: she's not suicidal, she's just... defeated. Her redemption comes in the form of death. Specifically, death by zombie. And, man! does Angel rise to the occasion! I loved Rowland's deadpan humor: Angel's comeback to life, literally and figuratively - her Big Chance - is being reborn a zombie, and seeing her trying to make the best out of this... hmm... unusual situation is both hilarious and sweet - she's a character you genuinely root for and the author made the best possible choice focusing all her attention on her heroine (no Alpha Males around, dear friends! This is truly all about Angel).I lamented the lack of edginess the cover hinted at but I'm thinking it might have worked out for the best after all: Rowland quiet story of redemption and brain smoothies wasn't what I was expecting but I liked what I've got even better.

I've heard good things about it, but zombies are not my thing at all. However, since they're not unthinking monsters in this one I guess it made all the difference. I do enjoy a good paranormal read.Angel is loser with no future, she's comes from a poor broken home, with a drunk dad who abuses her and dead mom, she drinks, has a pill addiction, can't hold down a job and already has an arrest record. Then everything changes when she wakes up from an accident with no memory and is forced to take a job a Van driver for a Coroner by parole officer. Happy with a second chance at life, Angel decides to take it seriously, but soon she realizes something else... she also has new craving for brains.I really liked Angel. We didn't get to see her at her worst, but we did see her try to her best to do well at her second chance at life... or undeath... Yeah, it wasn't easy for her and she even admits herself, that if she was still able to feel the effects of drugs and alcohol then she'd never would have had the courage or even the drive to turn her life around. Which I think it kind of brave thing to admit and even acknowledge. There was also never really a feeling that anyone judged her for it and in fact, the supporting characters were all rooting for her. But she does find the courage to finally tell her loser boyfriend to fuck off and to stand up to her abusive father. So I guess, while being a sort of fun light hearted zombie story, this book does touch upon serious issues in a very subtle way. There wasn't a lot whole lot of explanation to why zombies exist or any details about anything else supernatural, but it sort of made sense because we're seeing everything through Angel's eyes and we're learning along side with her. It also didn't go too much into zombie lore... which I really wouldn't know much about anyway.

But she still doesn\u2019t know what and how it happened. We follow her as she learns to be zombie what it means and how much her life changes, including her diet. She also learns what will happen if she does not follow her required brain diet and it is not pretty.

Now on probation for a felony, it seems that Angel will never pull herself out of the downward spiral her life has taken.That is, until the day she wakes up in the ER after overdosing on painkillers. Angel remembers being in an horrible car crash, but she doesn't have a mark on her. To add to the weirdness, she receives an anonymous letter telling her there's a job waiting for her at the parish morgue\u2014and that it's an offer she doesn't dare refuse.Before she knows it she's dealing with a huge crush on a certain hunky deputy and a brand new addiction: an overpowering craving for brains. Plus, her morgue is filling up with the victims of a serial killer who decapitates his prey\u2014just when she's hungriest!Angel's going to have to grow up fast if she wants to keep this job and stay in one piece. Because if she doesn't, she's dead meat.Literally.", "title": "My Life As a White Trash Zombie\n      \n          (White Trash Zombie #1)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11524208-my-life-as-a-white-trash-zombie", "average": 3.93, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328341531l/11524208.jpg", "reviews": 1651, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/852078.Diana_Rowland", "name": "Diana Rowland"}], "type": ["Horror", "Fantasy", "Fantasy", "Horror", "Fantasy"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11524208-my-life-as-a-white-trash-zombie", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9640626-my-life-as-a-white-trash-zombie", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11311975-my-life-as-a-white-trash-zombie", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15923036-my-life-as-a-white-trash-zombie", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25407522-my-life-as-a-white-trash-zombie", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6048518-mark-of-the-demon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6540270-blood-of-the-demon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8107779-secrets-of-the-demon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11019938-sins-of-the-demon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12766833-even-white-trash-zombies-get-the-blues", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19755140-embassytown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32858845-off-to-be-the-wizard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10931746-the-stepford-wives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13604418-the-long-earth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34111309-the-man-of-legends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193375-fellside", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204943-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18806963-prayers-to-broken-stones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18126623-2061", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29425329-alas-babylon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193696-3001", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18162904-dreams-and-shadows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35106805-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25353286-provenance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23249416-an-unwelcome-quest"]}
