It's lurking in your bookshops! *tosses confetti*September 6 2013 edit: The first two chapters of THE FALCONER are now posted to sample! Check out the Gollancz Blog for chapter 2!Hi Goodreads people!The first chapter of THE FALCONER is now available to read over on  SciFiNow!I'm glad so many of you enjoyed my pre-release pictorial presentation on here, but I've made the decision to remove it for these reasons:1. ARCs have gone out into the world! Readers can now review the book. They can tell you all about it, and you can decide from there if it sounds like something that'll suit your fancy without my (author bias!) input.2. It is so close to being published in the UK, so it'll be widely available to read, and I don't want my pictorial presentation coming before reviews (which are meant for you readers!).I'm sorry for removing it (since I know so many of you liked it), but I feel like it's time. As a parting gift, I'm keeping the baby seal."}, {"userName": "Samantha", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10067920-samantha", "userReview": "This has themes and tropes that remind me of Buffy, and I was hooked.

So now I'm off to buy the second one :)"}, {"userName": "Khanh, first of her name, mother of bunnies", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4527753-khanh-first-of-her-name-mother-of-bunnies", "userReview": "Faefever lite.\nThis was not a bad book, but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who has read and loved the Faefever series unless you enjoy constantly being hit on the head with dueling comparisons.It doesn't help that Kiaran's last name is MacKay. I couldn't help but chuckle every time I saw it. Also, Aileana...so similar to Alina.The parallels are too obvious, and I felt that the setting, characters, and conflict are overwhelmingly shadowed by the superiority of the Fever series. There's also a very forced attempt at romance, the inclusion of an eye-rolling love triangle, and a horrendous cliff hanger. One of the worst cliff hangers I've read this year. The plot itself is fine, the writing is good, it was fairly enjoyable if you don't overthink things, but knowing me, I overthink everything, hence my less-than-ideal rating for this book.The setting is 1844, a steampunk version of Scotland; it is but a pale version of steampunk, but I'll go into that later. Lady Aileana Kameron is 18, the daughter of a Scottish Marquess; currently she is embroiled in scandal, the subject of whispers and suspicious glares at every social event she attends. Why? One year ago she was discovered hovering, bloodied and traumatized, over her mother's corpse. Her mother's heart was ripped out from her chest. The official story is that Lady Douglas died from an animal attack; Aileana knows better. Her mother was killed by fairies.From then on, she formed a strategic alliance with Kiaran, a fae, a sithichean daione sith, to get vengeance for her mother's killer. Neither knows the others' true purpose for hunting the fae, and their alliance is strictly business---until now. To complicate things, her father has returned to town, demanding that Aileana must choose a husband, and she's got no shortage of suitors---she's still a peer's daughter, his heiress, and with a plump dowry, after all. Conveniently, Aileana's former crush also returns to town from Oxford, possibly to rekindle the sparks of a romance...but Gavin has some secrets of his own. And further still, there's danger lurking literally beneath Edinburgh. Which is pronounced Ed-in-bruh, for you ignorant Americans out there *shakes fist*.\nParallels to Faefever:\n- Death of a much-beloved relative: Aileana's mother's was killed by a fae- Desire to wreak vengeance: Aileana's made it her mission in life to track down and kill the sith that killed her mother- A newfound ability to see fairies: in this case, brought on by the flower seilgfl\u00f9r- Endangered when she is discovered: Aileana stupidly goes out to hunt fairies on her own, fairies (which are supposed to be invisible to the average human eye) realize that she can see them. You might as well paint a target on Aileana's head- Girly-girl debutante transforms into deadly fae-killer: \"For the briefest moment, I wish I was the girl I used to be. I\u2019d wear frivolous white dresses and attend dances and never worry about anything ever again. But I had to destroy the girl who wore white dresses because she wasn\u2019t capable of murder\"- Asshole: Kiaran, aka Jericho Barrons' more boring half-brother, who trains her, is mean to her, kicks her ass, and keeps secrets from her.\nIt\u2019s just another blasted secret of his. I\u2019m considering keeping a tally of all the questions Kiaran evades, so that when each answer is finally revealed at some incredibly inopportune moment, I can look at the count and remember how much he hides from me.\nKiaran is also seemingly V'lane's cousin's sister's son twice removed, because he has but a shadow of V'lane's sexual glamour. It's called being \"faestruck.\" Instead of making you want to have sex with the fae on the spot...faestruck glamour will just makes your panties slightly damp.\nCatherine grasps the sleeve of Kiaran\u2019s frock coat, twisting the fabric to pull him to her, her eyes dazed. The faestruck will rip and tear clothing for another touch of a faery\u2019s skin. She hasn\u2019t reached that point, not yet, but any further contact with him and she might.\n- Ability to sense an particular object: \u2018You feel power. And you\u2019ve sensed the s\u00ecthichean since the first one you ever saw, haven\u2019t you?\u2019- Secret lineageI don't know if it was intentional, if this book was intended to be a homage or an alternative retelling of Faefever, but the parallels and similarities are definitely there. It was a good book, but it is just lacking in comparison.\nThe Setting\nThe setting was just not well done. I neither got a sense of Edinburgh itself or of the steampunk elements within it. Really, there was absolutely no purpose for the setting, and I really don't know why this book had to be steampunk. The steampunk-ish elements of this alternate-Edinburgh was limited to horseless carriages, cool decorations at balls and society events, ornithopters (a Leonardo Da Vinci's version of a helicopter), machines that dispense hot beverages, and conveniently designed weaponry that will blast away an army of faeries with a push of a button.The steampunk setting seems to be in place more to suit Aileana's hobby of tinkering, building machines, and designing custom tools than anything else. This book's setting, unlike the beautifully wrought dark atmosphere of the Faefever series, is but an afterthought. I did not find myself immersed at all, I did not lose myself in the surroundings. I did not get a feel of what made Edinburgh a place where humans and fairies coexist. It might as well have been the rich/poor areas of Detroit, Michigan, for the little thought paid to the descriptions of the book's environment. There was no sense of place.The fae were very well written. There are many types, and they are very well described, some disgustingly rotten, others terrifyingly beautiful. I just wished that we had a beautiful, dark setting fitting of them, instead of the half-hearted quasi-steampunk scene we were given.\nThe Characters\nAileana: She didn't feel real to me, unlike MacKayla in Faefever and her amazing character development, Aileana just doesn't compare. Aileana was supposed to have turned from a gentle, happy society girl into a rage-filled, vengeance-minded cold-hearted fighter...but I didn't get any sense of her transformation. She was just too perfect, her transformation was told rather than shown. I understood her rage, her helplessness, her anger at witnessing her mother's death, but we were never clearly told how she has changed so much in that little time. We are given Aileana 2.0, we are never shown how she got there. We see from the beginning of the book that she is an ass-kicking heroine, but it feels like that's all she is.Don't get me wrong, I loved the fact that she is unflinching in her quest for vengeance. She never, ever shies from killing an evil fae. Unlike some books featuring so-called \"female assassins\" who are scared to draw blood (which shall remain unnamed), Aileana is a determined killer. And I loved it, I loved seeing her kick, punch, stab, shoot. I loved seeing her as she slashes, disembowels, electrocutes. I just wished we saw more of her vulnerabilities as she became what she currently is. Her grief is also well-portrayed, to the point that at times, I said to myself: enough already. Yes, I am cold-hearted, but her extreme grief seems a little bit of an exaggeration.Also, drinking game! Take a drink every time you read the phrase: \"Crimson suits you best.\" Or not. You might get alcohol poisoning. Maybe take a sip of a beer instead.Kiaran: Generic YA love interest. Really, I made a comparison to Jericho and V'lane, but the truth is, there is no comparison. Kiaran has no personality than that of the standard mysterious, ice-cold, unfeeling bad boy with a secret heart and a soft spot in his soul that only the main character can see. The alliance between Aileana (he calls her Kam) and Kiaran seemed...odd. There was very little about their history together in that very short year, we are not given much at all about their past besides the fact that Kiaran trains Aileana to be a fighter, a killer. Too little detail was given about their past to make their current relationship seem like anything but an alliance, and that is why their developing feelings seem so strange. I think Gavin says it best:\n\u2018Is that right? The fellow teaches you to slaughter his own kind and you don\u2019t believe that\u2019s a wee bit worthy of suspicion?\u2019\nGavin: The perfect love rival, with a twist. A really, really convenient and unbelievable twist. Gavin is perfect. He is a student at Oxford, he is Aileana's beloved best friend's brother. He is an earl. He is wealthy. He is understanding. Aileana has also been nursing aspirations of being the future Mrs. for a long time before she changed into a cold-hearted killer. Aileana needs a husband, Gavin is oh-so-very eligible. What's a girl to do? Why, love triangle, of course!Side characters: Well-written enough to keep me interested. I wish there had been more written about Aileana's relationship with her father; they are so distant from each other, they have such a strained relationship, and it was painful to read at times. I felt very badly for Aileana for her father's continued disinterest in her, he is the very picture of an absentee father. Not uncommon, given the time, and given his status as nobility, who are expected to ignore their children, but I truly felt bad for Aileana for her father's neglect. I wish their relationship had been developed further.I loved her best friend, Catherine. Catherine is beautiful, and unlike the trapfalls of having a beautiful best friend who exists to highlight the heroine's flaws, Catherine is absolutely lovely in character as well as appearance. I wish I had a best friend like her. She is so utterly supportive, such a calming influence on Aileana: a truly enjoyable character that I wish had been more involved in her life.There is a little sidekick pixie named Derrick in this book. He exists to mend Aileana's clothes and to be an annoying little shit, it seems. I know Derrick is there for insertion of humor and lightness into an overall dark book, but personally, I wanted to snatch him out of the air and pluck out his wings. He is a nuisance more often than not, and he truly grates on my nerves. And he has a habit of getting drunk on honey that would put Winnie the Pooh to shame.\n\u2018But your friend offered it,\u2019 Derrick complains. \u2018So she might not have explicitly said, \u201cDerrick, please eat all of the honey in my kitchen,\u201d but it was implied by the mere fact that she has a kitchen.\u2019\nShall I mention the fact that that little phrase was uttered after his neglect almost got Aileana killed that night? Now do you understand why I want to commit pixie-cide?\nThe Romance\n: Not plausible. Why? I needed more background on them. Right off the bat, after a year of fighting together and little else, we see glimpses of Aileana's thoughts that signalled that she might fall for him. Inexplicable. Why now? Why all of a sudden? Aileana is not irrational, she knows that he's a killer, she knows that he's cold-hearted, for fuck's sakes, Kiaran kills his fellow fae without telling her why. They have never confided in one another as to why they're committed to their quest, their relationship has been strictly business-like, strictly student-mentor, so why does she start developing feelings now? Their conversations in the book are largely impersonal, more fraught with conflict than romance, there's not much bonding, so their feelings feel...forced. And really? In the middle of all this mess? Is it really a good time to start a romance?\nHe turns to look at me, and our faces are a mere breath away. Everything around me fades and blurs and my gaze drops to his lips.Gavin\u2019s voice sounds so very far away. \u2018Get back, faery. Now.\u2019Bloody hell. I recoil from Kiaran, suddenly aware of what I almost did. My cheeks flush and my heart speeds up in embarrassment. I swear, I was tempted to kiss Kiaran, and in front of Derrick and Gavin, no less. What is wrong with me?\nYeah, Aileana. I don't know what's wrong with you, either.Recommended to younger readers who want a fast-paced, action-packed fantasy, a brain-candy type of book.

I'm kicking myself for taking so long to read this?! It was a pure delight with fantastic characters and the kind of bloody stabbtastic plot I need. And holy heck so much sociopathic faerie feral wildness going down. Yesssss thanks.Although I have to say what the HECK WAS THAT ENDING.Talk about a frikkin' non-ending omg. I need book 2 like I need air and I don't have it so rip me I guess I will go impersonate a waterfall.I really loved Aileana! The badass faerie killer.I also admit I can't remember her name and literally had to go get it off the blurb. But oh well. We all have our failings. Mine is never having a clue who anyone is. BUT ANYWAY. I loved how Aileana chaffed at her \"proper\" life as a lord's daughter and doing the balls and dresses etc etc...but she didn't diss them. Makes such a difference. And she was elegant and also badass and she was an engineer with all these murderous inventions to kill faeries. I mean, can she get any more awesome?! THIS is the kind of female heroine I love reading about!! She's super blood thirsty and also kind of sweet. Afajdsklad.Also I loved how heavily this book features PTSD.I often find with fantasy we like skip over the \"effects\" and just focus on the battle or whatever. But this goes into the actual mental health side!! Aileana's mother was murdered in front of her (when she was little) and that absolutely messes with her ALL the time. She has backflashes and PTSD metldowns and just...this. Thank you. I like. Please yes.Dark stabby faeries are also my favourite.I loved Kiaran (lmao I looked up his name too) SO much. He's very mysterious and also extremely powerful, but he and Aileana train to kill faeries. Aka Kairan is killing his own kind. But why? WHY WOULD HE TELL US THAT. HE'S A SNEAKY FAERIE. Anyway he was beautiful and deadly and snarky and I freaking love him.And I just really like how dangerous and wild all the faeries are. Everyone gets stabbed and bitten and poisoned. It's beautiful. 10/10 And the pixie who basically lives in Aileana's pocket or on her shoulder is really sassy!!OK so there is a bit of a \"love triangle\"...but I almost wouldn't call it that?But there's Kiaran the dark stabby fey and then there's Aileana's childhood friend, Gavin, who returns and is suddenly dashing and has SUPER RELATIVE SECRETS. I liked that (a) Aileana was focused on important things and not wishy washing about who she wanted to kiss, ZERO of that, and (b) Gavin AND Kiaran were both fleshed out and super interesting. So it's not REALLY a triangle, but sort of??? IDK read the freaking book. Just do it.I also loved the writing!It was really detailed and the added layer of describing all the smells made it really leap off the page. I thought the pacing was also pretty damn fine EXCEPT FOR THE ENDING WHICH WAS NOT AN ENDING AND I AM N O T OK WITH THIS.ALL IN ALL? This was a fantastic surprise! Dark faeries and a steampunk Scottish setting with a badass, engineering, and emotional heroine I absolutely want to read more about. It totally captured my imagination! Plus there's a scene where Kiaran says: \"fite me bet u can't\" and so Aileana just shoots him.She is my hero.****\"We're facing the apocalypse,\" he replies. \"There is not enough tea in the world to calm me.\"\"Your eyes glow,\" I murmur. \"Do you know they glow? Like a bloody street lamp.\"\"Shall I take that as a compliment or a criticism?\"\"I should have mentioned they breathe burning mist, shouldn't I?\"\"Your ability to communicate is atrocious, did you know that?\"Kiaran shrugs. The closest he comes to betraying emotions is when he stabs something."}, {"userName": "Navessa", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18104163-navessa", "userReview": "Wow.

We were riding unicorns along a deserted beach as our hair whipped in the wind, occasionally strands of her red and my brown locks blending together. We gazed lovingly together as we rode, smiling as joy filled our hearts in an almost mutual amount.When we pulled our unicorns to a break, having reached the peak of a cliff overlooking the sea, I took an opportunity to ask her a question.\u201cElizabeth,\u201d I said whimsically as I gazed out at the setting sun glinting off the ocean, \u201cWhy did you break my heart with the ending of The Falconer?\u201dShe smiled sadly and beckoned me forward, cricking her finger in my direction to encourage me closer. I leaned in expectantly. In a flash she was on me, stabbing me several times in the abdomen before whipping behind me, yanking my hair back and slitting my throat. As the blood spewed out my throat, drenching my chest, she whispered in my ear, \u201cThe House of May sends its regards.\u201dThen she dumped my body over the cliff, but I wasn\u2019t paying attention to that. Because I was dead. My soul wasn\u2019t, though. That is until she shot it, and it died too.I really enjoyed The Falconer. It wasn\u2019t a perfect read. For example, I loved Aileana\u2019s tinkering, and the various Steampunk aspects of this book. However, I feel like some of the aspects (Like a hovering hand that retrieves library books) were a little far-fetched. The world interacted a little with the Steampunk aspects, but most of the innovations seemed limited to Aileana\u2019s Fae killing usage.There is a love interest. He is hot. Like, splooge hot.

May didn\u2019t get all flowery about the romance. No. She got all flowery about the violence and massacre. I swear to god, for anyone who likes kicking ass, and protagonists who can do so \u2013 this is the perfect book for it. There is just a surplus of things that need to be shot, stabbed or blown up and Aileana is so very ready to oblige! With delicious, delicious abandon.The plot is the really healthy dose of angst, murdering the living hell out of things, and romantic tension. They cycle around you, one after the other, like you\u2019re a little kid on a Merry-G0-Round.

I find it excruciatingly boring. Here's some taffeta and high tea and let's have masked balls and let me carry my parasol and oh, fie! What do you make of these new inventions?I hate the Victorian era because it's so overdone. You know what else is overdone? You know what else I'm sick of? London. Before any of you get into a flap - particularly any of you who know me - let me preface that by saying that London is the shiz. London absolutely rocks. Have you been to London? Oh my god, go. London is such a cool ass city, but that doesn't mean I want every single piece of British media to be set there. I mean, my god, stop trying to make Victorian London happen. It's not going to happen.This book tore me two ways. Victorian era? Stop it, I beg of you. Edinburgh? Nyeh. Just let me have a quick look.I think my absolute favourite thing about this book is that it's devoid of stereotypes. People say aye and they eat shortbread, but...people say aye and eat shortbread in Scotland. That shit gets done. But this book does not fall back on woad and barbarism. This book says that high society existed and still exists in Scotland, because look at Rose Leslie, who lived in a fucking castle when she was a kid. Like, what the actual? I lived in a townhouse and then a caravan. Look, whatever. And never mind that I secretly love books and movies about people being filthy and wearing armpit daggers in the Middle Ages (I'm sorry, but I love the wars of independence. They were such a perfect example of how money and fancy costumes can't buy nationalism). I liked Elizabeth May's Victorian era. I actually felt something in the face of the age old \"I have to marry for duty, not love\" tirade despite it usually treating my patience like mortar to pestle. \"I have to marry for duty not love\" is - wait for it - overdone as hell, but because Aileana has so much agency and passion for her cause, that is, killing evil faeries, it really strikes a chord. All of this bravery and skill that Aileana has built up, and all the time she has spent hardening herself, will be thrown to the wind. It'll all be for nothing. She'll go from battle-axe to subjugated Victorian wife. Isn't that sad? I think that's really fucking sad, and true of women, now and in antiquity, who've built lives for themselves only to have them pried from their hands for the sake of marriage. Look at Jill Duggar. That girl was training to be a midwife, and spent hours upon hours studying and taking house calls and even going abroad to help women who needed her, only to toss it all away because Duggar wives don't go to college or have careers. They literally aren't allowed to. I mean, jesus christ, the girl was pregnant seven minutes after she left the altar. Calm the fuck down.Aileana surprised me in that her struggle felt real, and so did her grief. Man, her grief was epic. Don't knock Crimson suits you best because the girl is obviously suffering through some serious survivor's guilt and that does ugly things to a person. You might think that her constantly banging on about revenge and the hunt and her burning desire to taste the guts of her enemies is tiresome, but for me it rings true. This protagonist is fucked up and she knows it. She's going through some serious shit and she's a very unstable person at her core. What I'm getting at is that it hit me in the feels, and that matters. It matters that I felt something. I was supposed to feel something.The author's love for the city of Edinburgh is obvious, and it shone through in such careful, adoring descriptions, which isn't to say that I feel that the setting was rendered to its full potential - it wasn't - but I got a sense of it and it was present. That said, I have strong expectations for setting. Setting should feel like a character in and of itself. The setting ought to have a pulse, and we ought to care about it, and it doesn't count if you care about it because you've already been there and seen how awesome Edinburgh is (it's awesome. Behind my hand, with eyes averted, I'll say that it's not as good as Glasgow. Glasgow rocks my world, daily. Glasgow is my fucking lover, with its rock-hard abs and ass that won't quit. But Edinburgh is goddamn beautiful). You need to feel it in your soul. And in your special place.Speaking of special places, I want to mash my face up against Kiaran's, because this dude is glorious, so tough and dark and scary, but that's not what'll make your panties damp. (This review is all kinds of NSFW.) What'll make your panties damp or your jeans a little tight is that he's such a fucking feminist. Oh, Kiaran, I love it when you talk social justice to me.This dude treats Aileana with so much respect, and he's such a great example of a male character who's dark and broody and mysterious but isn't a sexist prick about it. He sees her sexuality and he prays to it; he listens to her when she explains how hard it is to be a woman in her world, and he humbles himself before the social struggle that she is facing. He spars with her, and beats her, and that's awesome because he's not coddling her or treating her like she's incapable. He trusts her and believes in her. I think that is beautiful, and it's refreshing, and this is me enjoying a Victorian era novel. Enjoy it while it lasts. That piquant tang of my agreement will be gone as quickly as it came.The writing's smooth, and while it could've had a little more flair, it's nothing to sniff at. Solid, strong, consistent. It's what was needed. Even if I nearly broke my neck with all of that Gaelic. (Sorry I'm not from Oban, okay?) Some good advice I can give you is that sgian-dubh is pronounced \"skeen-duu\", and that sith is \"shee\" which means that baobhan sith is \"bah-van shee\". Now say that three times fast. Bah-van shee. Banshee. Cool, right? Told you that a shit-ton of faerie lore comes courtesy of your good friend Alba.(On a side note, why are villains always called Sorcha? Why? Wow, this just got super personal.)My beef with this book both is and isn't the author's fault. What isn't the author's fault is the steampunk, which I absolutely hate. Steampunk can eat my toenails. I'm not even that sure what it is about it that pisses me off; it just does. But it's annoying because I love, love, that Aileana is an engineer and please, girls, be engineers. Live your dreams! Change the world! Tell your daughters that they can fix cars and built rocket ships! Tell them about the women who built warplanes in the thirties and forties! Tell them that it was a woman who created the coding that allowed modern computers to exist! Tell them these things!Just keep your steampunk away from me!Like I said, it's not the author's fault that I hate steampunk, thus all of those gears and the ornithoptor and this bag of vomit did not affect my rating. What did knock the star off is that this book isn't fucking finished. I kept looking for more pages at the end, because what the actual fuck? That's not an ending. That is not how you finish a novel. Part of me doesn't even believe that the author wanted to finish this book this way, because the rest of this novel was solid and logical and consistent. How was it all supposed to end? No author anywhere, ever, at any point in time, has ever written an ending like that in a word document, then hit save and shut their laptop down, with a smiling sigh of, \"There. Done.\" Nobody would ever be satisfied with that, so who made this happen? Editors? An agent? How incredibly bleak.I'm definitely picking up the next book, but only because of that cliffhanger. And my anger about the cliffhanger is not a cute Tumblr anger like \"stop torturing us because we love these characters so much and miss them and how dare you end this book!\" It's genuine irritation that a good book was spoiled by a crappy ending. Now I'm all hot and bothered and it's bedtime. I'm taking my leave of all of you. Blast you all, ninnies and scallywags! (That physically hurt. Let's never do this again.)"}, {"userName": "Pouting Always", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-pouting-always", "userReview": "Aileana is a upper class Scottish girl living in 1844, recently back out on the social scene a year after her mother's death. Though before she fit into it all seamlessly, after watching a faery murder her mother she has become changed. She has spent the past year training with another one of the fae, Kiaran, to kill the fae. I think with books a lot of times there's this trade off between the writing and the story telling and honestly I would much rather have good story telling than good writing. When I started reading the book I was a little annoyed at how immature the writing seemed, but it's ya so it's not really meant for someone as old as I am so I kept reading and I'm really glad I did. After about five pages I started to really get into the story. It was so good, the way it all flows and builds up to that final scene at the end was excellent. I also really liked all the characters, I can't think of one person who got on my nerves through out the book. Aileana is a sweetheart and I love Derrick. The steampunk thing was pretty cool too, I haven't read a lot of things incorporating that but I enjoyed it here and wouldn't mind reading more of it in the future. I can understand people may not have enjoyed it because it parallels others series they've read or because it seems like a typical YA book but I think when reading YA people should really be more realistic about their expectations. Things like this story have been done but I think this is a terrific execution of the story and that is worthwhile to read."}, {"userName": "Brittney ~ Reverie and Ink", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50044222-brittney-reverie-and-ink", "userReview": "*Full review update*This was quite the pleasant surprise. Scotland? Steampunk? A dark heroine that slays? Why yes, thank you. Magic? Fae? Seelie/Unseelie Courts? Heck yes, I'll take them all.We start off with a broken heroine- which is how I like them best. I find that I connect with MC's when I catch them in their moments of weakness- and Aileana drew me in quickly. She's cold and barely hanging onto her humanity when we first meet her. It's been a year since her mother was murdered; since she re-purposed her life for revenge. \n\n\u201cTime won\u2019t fix me. Time allows me to become more skillful at hiding how much I hurt inside. Time makes me a great liar. Because when it comes to grief, we all like to pretend.\u201d\n\nShe keeps up a normal \"pretense,\" but behind everyone's back, she is someone else entirely. Not only is she driven by revenge, she's also brilliant. She legit builds her own gadgets to take down any fae she comes across. At night, she trains /hunts with Kiaran. We know next to nothing about this dude. All we know is he is fae and he hunts his own kind. (AAAND not to mention the fact that he's Rhysand's doppleganger basically... seriously, they look identical.) He's devious, mysterious, and wowza super powerful. Then we have Derrick, the pixie that lives in her closet (who, I might add, is my favorite character.) He's sassy and hysterical and obsessed with getting drunk on honey (yes, that's a thing).Honestly, I knew nothing about the actual plot and I'd recommend reading it without any expectations. The development/world building was a bit lacking, if I'm honest. I liked the amount of mystery surrounding everything - I love being kept in the dark and left guessing. However, the whole \"war\" element was extremely vague and didn't make much sense. (Like okay- if this upcoming war is such a big deal... why is she and Kiaran the only ones doing anything about it? And why aren't they more worried that its going to be 2 people against thousands??) So, on that note- I felt like there were big chunks missing out of the plot and general world building. I'm hoping for better development in the next book. If it weren't for this, it would have been an easy 5 stars. Whatever, I still enjoyed it... mostly because I loved the characters so much. Plus, several elements of the magic system paired along with the whole steampunk gadgetry really made this super fun and unique. The Fae have all different classes and abilities - and Aileana can actually sense their power - she gets a certain taste in her mouth when one is near. It is actually super cool how it is described. One thing I've seen in several reviews is the complaint on the similarities of this book vs. the \"Fever\" series by Moning. I've read the first book in the Fever series and was quite let down. The idea was really cool (and very similar to this- true) but that one just went over the edge with the cringe worthy sexual content (death by sex... really guys?) and a heroine that was annoying. Sorry if you like the series- I'm not judging... but this was everything I wanted from the \"Fever\" series and didn't get. I've been searching for similar books since I read that one - looking for the whole Seelie/Unseelie court jazz.. and FINALLY found this one. NOW FOR A BIG FAT GIANT WARNING...Holy crap... Cliffhanger alert. Seriously, have the next book ready. Aaaand I'd just like to add that I've already started the first few pages of the next and I'm pretty estatic at the direction soooo YAY.All in all, I'd definitely recommend checking out this book. I think it deserves much more recognition and hype.My Blog ~ Instagram ~ Twitter ~ Etsy"}, {"userName": "Emily May", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may", "userReview": "2.5Goodreads members have differing opinions on what kind of rating is the hardest to write a review for. Some say it's the ones they didn't like - perhaps trying to keep a balance between their own subjective dislikes and the overall general standard of the book; some say it's the all time favourites - how can you put that kind of book love into words? For others, myself included, it's those annoying books that sit right in the middle. Those books that are okay. Fine. Overwhelmingly average. When they're neither bad nor good, what do I say? For me, The Falconer is one of those books. I feel like I've read this book about fifty times before (okay, five or six but shh...) and I feel like I've written this very same review that many times as well.If you're new to fantasy, if you're new to faeries in fantasy, there's no real reason for you not to like this novel set in an alternative Edinburgh in the year 1844. It's a little tame for my liking, occasionally almost edging towards the middle grade end of the age range, but I'm sure newcomers to the genre will find it more entertaining. But all I can see are the same recycled features: a female warrior protagonist who's out for vengeance, an awkwardly forced romance, another love triangle, and a cliffhanger worthy of Moning's Fever series. In fact, this book feels like an amalgamation of several I've read before. It's like Shadow and Bone without the Darkling, Throne of Glass without the entertainment (or a fabulous sequel to make the first worth sitting through), and Darkfever without, like, everything I love about that series.The writing is fairly good, though. With some more original material, I think I could find myself returning to see what the author writes in the future. I've just exhausted myself on this story line. But anyway. Here's what's happening in The Falconer: Lady Aileana Kameron is the daughter of the Marquess of Douglas in Scotland. She was blissfully enjoying upper class life and social events until a faery murdered her mother and she became a hunter. In secret, she slays faery after faery, hoping to one day come face to face with the faery who murdered her mother and quench the need for revenge that is burning inside her. On top of that, drama ensues when her father returns and demands she choose a husband. Other possible suitors aside, Aileana is torn between her fae ally - Kiaran - and her old crush - Gavin - who has recently returned to Edinburgh.I will say that I'm glad the author included nasty, evil faeries. While there is obviously some faery romanticization with Kiaran, the faeries in this novel tend to be the vicious, blood-thirsty kind (perfect, in my opinion). But I think there is a lot of untapped potential in this story and a bit of tweaking could have made it a more original and engaging tale. For one thing, it actually took me a while to realise that this is supposed to be a steampunk novel, those elements of it were so subtle that I didn't even notice them at first. I'm really enthusiastic about the new steampunk genre because it combines so many different things that I love, but I find myself being frequently disappointed by the lack of it in books that promise so much. Don't be afraid to go all out, I say! I want machines! I want old times! I want that magical blend of science fiction and historical! ...please?Afterthought: I compared this book to many others and I remember noting to myself several times that it seemed loosely similar to the Fever series. But Khanh did a fantastic (and shocking) breakdown of the similarities between this and Faefever in her review. Wow.

This books was a lot of fun. I doubt it's anything new, but it was fun and I enjoyed reading this so much. When I saw the words \"murder\" and \"covered in blood\" from the first page, I knew I was going to love this. I binge read this even though it was frigging 12 p.m and I had to sleep. But forget sleep when you have this book. This book isn't the best thing in the world and I had a lot of problems with it, but it's still a good read. Aileana Kameron aka Kam was covered in her mother's blood the night her mother was murdered. Rumors are spread saying that Kam was the one who murdered her mother and because of that she has a tough relationship with her father and pretty much everyone else. What everyone doesn't know is that it was a faery that murdered Kam's mother and now Kam, also a gifted Falconer (peeps who have the gift to kill faeries) hunts and kills faeries who murder innocent humans. She's also out for revenge to hunt down and kill the faerie who killed her mom.\u2192My biggest problem with this book is the lack of world building. There is not much information about the faeries and pixies. Terms like sithichean, seilgflur, daoinesith, and many more words are just thrown in the story and not explained. I think these were some of the faerie breeds, but they aren't described and explained and I was left clueless most of the time about the story and world building. There's also no explaining where the faerie's came from, how the breed of Falconer's was born and much more spoiler-y information. \u2192The romance: This is a spoiler about the romance. At first, I though the romance was going to be a love triangle between Gavin and Kiaran. Gavin is a Seer (another term that isn't really explained well) and Kiaran is some breed of faerie or something that trains Kam to fight the evil faeries. Gavin was Kam's childhood lover and was away for 2 years, but then returns and is forced to marry Kam when her reputation is put in danger. I actually liked Gavin, but loved Kiaran more and imagine my screaming when Kam and Kiaran end up together AND KISS AT THE END AHHH. \u2192Also, that ending was very abrupt and left loose. I feel like the author just quickly crammed that in. It wasn't a well done ending and it happened so out of nowhere and quickly that I was left confused and had to reread like 3 times to understand what was going on. \u25c7Kam is a likeable MC and I enjoyed her character, though she wasn't really developed and I would have liked a little more character development. The characters are sort of boring and bland except for Kiaran. I love him so :))*Just something I have to say about the steampunk part of this book. Please correct me if I'm wrong though!\u2796I know this is steampunk/historical and it's a time period where they are discovering technology and blah blah blah, but did anyone notice the part about the earplugs towards the end? When SPOILER, Kam gave Kiaran earplugs, but there is no mentioning of how they were invented and I don't remeber reading about cellphones or any other electronic device that uses earplugs. It was so thrown out of nowhere and I forgot to mention it in my review before. Where did those earplugs come from\u2753\u2753\u2753\u2753 Did I miss something???Overall, it was a fast paced, fun, and interesting read and I cannot wait to get my hands on the next book.

DNF at 32%. I *really* wanted to like this. I tried. I did. Why didn't I like this? I don't quite know. There was just something... generic about it. I felt nothing for the main character. I could not connect to the plot or the heroine whatsoever. (By the way, I didn't think this was much like the Fever series at all except for the barrier in the fae world collapsing that only one special human could fix. I read where some saw a lot of similarities that didn't occur to me until reading their reviews. I didn't see it while I was reading, anyways...) I think one of the issues is I felt like I was dropped in the middle of a story right when it began. Aileana was already battling evil fae, she had already met the romantic interest. (I'm assuming he becomes the romantic lead. The sexy aloof fae who trained her, Kiaran.) I felt like I had missed something. Was there a prequel?The premise really sounded interesting, plus it has a Regency/steampunk vibe, which I love. But something was missing for me. I didn't click with the writing style, although there was nothing wrong with the writing.

Like, to the point where I'm honestly surprised there is no legal issues with Karen Marie Moning.Please, if you have already read The Fever Series and enjoyed it, steer clear of this book because it will only infuriate you. If you have not read The Fever Series and want to read about evil Seelie and Unseelie fae trying to take over the world, while a huge unnecessary love triangle unfolds, please just skip this series and just read The Fever Series because it's a million times better than this sad attempt. I mean, it is trying to be a steampunk/historical version of The Fever Series, and that's sort of different, right? I mean, the book is still being published, so I guess nothing was violated. Also, again, very reminiscent of Jericho Barrons, one of the love interests does some questionable, problematic shit that is never okay to do. I get it, really I do, he's the angsty bad boy that doesn't want to fall in love, because he's been hurt so many times before, but none of that shit gives him a reason to treat the girl horribly. I've read this shit a million times, and it is never okay. I'm just sick of carbon, problematic, copies. I know I sound harsh, and I'm sorry, but the only reason I even requested this ARC was because it was being marketed as a feminist read. With the results of this election, a lot of people were recommending it as a good feminist escapism book, and honestly I think they had to be reading something completely different than what I just forced myself to finish. Yeah, Aileana, the main protagonist, is an eighteen year old girl that is not happy having her life dictated by her father, and she voices her feelings to a couple of her friends, but that hardly deems this book feministic in my eyes. I mean, she looks more like a brooding teenager, who always knows best, more than anything else. But of course, she is the only special snowflake that can save the world. I mean, it's not like she would completely fuck it up for a boy, right? I sure do love reading almost 400 pages of an attempted plot, to just have it end on a cliff-hanger. Literally, nothing is solved at the end of this book. Nothing. This book is the epitome of tropes done badly, and I honestly don't want to waste anymore time even writing this review.

ME THROWING A FIT UNTIL BOOK TWO RELEASES!  ~~~~~~EDIT REVIEW~~~~~~  5 Stars THE FALCONER was PHENOMENAL!!! From it's Scotland lure, to it's vengeance and murder, to it's THRILLING, action-packed adventure, and heart-pounding, slow burning romance, that sent heat rising, and toes curling, THE FALCONER was exceptional, and did NOT disappoint!!!THE FALCONER is indescribably AWESOME!!! I can pretty much say that I loved just about everything about this book. I listened to most of it on audio, but also read some from the physical book. But honestly, I think I preferred listening to it rather then reading it. The narration was flawless, and one of the best I've come across in a long time.The characters were developed and had all the character traits I love. Aileana was broken and determined, fierce and deadly, but still capable of love and compassion. She was able to play her part to the T: Lady by day, elegant and noble, hunter my night, killer and deadly. And she was soooo good at it. Even though they both started to bleed into each other by the end of the book, she still played her part regardless of opinions. She was the perfect character for this book. I loved Aileana and can't wait to see how much more deadly and dangerous she becomes to her enemies in book two.And Aileana's mentor, and close but distant friend, Kiaran McKay was the perfect example of AWESOME!!! Ruthless and cunning, dark and dangerous, deadly, but loyal to his cause, and determined to right his many wrongs. He was the perfect mentor for Aileana\u2014smart, skilled, strong, powerful, deadly, and pushed her to the breaking to teach her her weaknesses. And he was so dam sexy at doing it!!!The world-building was unique and VERY well done. I loved the historical and Scotland background, intertwined with dark and dangerous faery's tearing the city apart. I thought the elegant lady by day and huntress killer by night was brilliant, and tied into the rest of the plot with ease and grace. It was just phenomenal!!! I loved the way it was done, written and narrated!! Yup, it's safe to say I pretty much loved everything about this novel and characters!!! THE PLOT  Heiress... Debutant... Murderer... Aileana Kameron is a Lady by day, and a killer by night... She's been that way since last year, when her mother was murdered, torn to shreds and had her heart ripped from her chest right in front of her. But the person, or should I say thing, that killed her mother wasn't even human at all. She ordinarily wouldn't be able to see them, the predators preying on the weak, but she was wearing the thistle\u2014A plant that gives humans the abilities to see their predators coming. And the predator that she seen that unforgettable night, was more terrifying and deadly, then anything she's ever laid her eyes on. But that was just the beginning for Aileana, aka Kam...They hunt weak humans, they devour their energy and kill them after their sucked dry. They are in all forms and shape, they are strong and mighty, they are imprisoned under the city, and they are breaking free little by little.They will either end the human race, or imprison them all. They are dangerous and deadly, and have many different strengths, and they are preparing to rise up and rule again, and if not stopped, they will defeat and conquer, and all will be lost to the human race. They are called Faerys, and they are coming....Only one can save the human race from death and imprisonment, and she is the last of her kind, the last remaining Falconer with the power to stop them. But she is only one against many, she is just learning and acquainting herself with her capabilities, she has yet to come into the ultimate power of a Falconer, but she will give her life to save them all. She is a hunter, the hunted, a predator, the prey, a killer, the rescuer, unstoppable, the defeat-able, she is lady Aileana, last Falconer and Scotland's only hope, and she will rise up and fight for them all...Dark, dangerous and deadly\u2014all my favorite qualities in a book, and THE FALCONER had them all and MORE!!!! The dark essence and deadly demeanor that THE FALCONER portrays is precise and flawless. I can not even come close in expressing the full depth of my love for this book. And that ending was strait TORTURE!!! It should really be freaking illegal to end a book like that, SERIOUSLY!!!! ;)Overall, THE FALCONER is one of the best fantasies I've read this year, and it will definitely be going on my favorites shelf where it will stay. I loved everything about this world; from the elegant, yet rough writing, to the superb acting of the narration, it was all just flawless and addicting, and totally time worthy.

Did I like it? Definitely. Though the plot was a bit average: special girl saves the world, she\u2019s training to kill evil creatures while being torturing by the memory of her mother\u2019s murder and falling for her enemy. BUT! The execution is good. Also, it was a very fast read.Seeing as I\u2019m new in steampunk genre, let me admire the mix of old times, beautiful gowns, distinguished manners and modern technologies. Metal spiders stitch your wounds, machines make your tea, a young lady creates an air vehicle\u2026 Too much? Not at all. All this stuff really suits the plot. I will continue my relationship with steampunk for sure.People say our MC Aileana is a murderer. Whom did she kill? Her mother. She was found next to her body two years ago, covered with blood. Back then Aileana said nothing and held her tears. That night in her hair was seilgfl\u00f9r (a plant which helps mortals to see fairies). That\u2019s why Aileana knows who\u2019s a real killer and she\u2019s going to get her revenge. For two years theMC has been crushing her enemy\u2019s kin: to the left, to the right, through the length and breadth. How does she manage to do such a thing? Kiaran. He\u2019s one of the highest Fae and he'd saved Aileana\u2019s life a couple of years ago. After that he became her hunter-partner (she doesn\u2019t know his reasons) an now he's helping her to kill his own kind. I\u2019m sure you have already guessed that this Fae-man is freaking awesome? Amethyst eyes, pitch-black hair, Apollo-like body, superpower within\u2026 Of course, I like Kiaran. With passing of time Aileana is getting used to her destiny and the danger she and the world are in. At days she leads her previous life with balls and tea-parties and other lady-like things, at nights she becomes a killer. It's hard to balance between two lives, but what choice does MC have? Aileana has a pixie Derrick, who lives in her wardrobe. This tiny elf-like creature adores eating (or drinking?) honey and do some sewing. He's adorable, funny and cute and actually saved The Falconer to me. At the start of reading I always gave a story 10 stars and then, page after page, they goes out (if there are reasons for them to do so). When The Falconer was left with 6 stars only, I\u2019ve read this:\n\n\u201cWhen Dante described the circles of Hell, he clearly forgot the one where a hungry pixie sits on one's shoulder for eternity.\u201d\n\nThis:\n\n\n\n\n\n        \u2018Daaaaaancing,\u2019 Derrick cries. \u2018I love daaaancing! Tell him to toss you over his head!\u2019\n      \n\n\nAnd this:\n\n\n      \"'Derrick giggles. \u2018Whirling! I love to whirl. Ask him to whirl faster! I see lights. Do you see the lights? Aileana? Do you see the lights\u2019\"\n    \n\nAnd decided this book will end up with 7 starts and no less.Oh, I almost forgot about Gavin, Aileana\u2019s bestfriend\u2019s brother. She had a crush on him when she was younger but now she\u2019s all about Kiaran. So believe me, there is no love-triangle (so faaar). Well, Gavin is a Seer; he's aware of fairies without any plants, that\u2019s why his human energy is really tasty for these magical creatures. That's why we can't let him be, he's in need of protection and can be useful. Also, that's not so bad to have him around. He's handsome, smart has manners and likes whisky (British men and tea? Nah, old-news).What to expect? A few chases, fights and kinds of Fae; a couple of balls and awesome machines, a bunch of funny banters, one really hot kiss, a couple of swoon moments and one epic-battle next to the end.The final\u2026 This part of the book assured me that I really have to give The Falconer 7 stars. The ending was promising and intriguing. I can smell the prequel would be better and can\u2019t wait to have it for myself.

And by that I mean nothing with the story and everything to do with who 18 year old Lady Aileana Kameron, the only daughter of the Marquess of Douglas truly is: A Falconer.Falconer: a female warrior born with gifts to hunt/kill fae...or really a Vampire Slayer minus the vampire and plus the fae.So we have steampunk,based in Scotland.So just add a red-headed warrior-heroine,sprinkle in a pixie,and a lot of faes.And you have this book.I think the narrator, Susan Duerden (\u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605) made me love this book even more because she has a Scottish Accent and it just drew the whole setting into a complete circle. She was easy to understand and it was just a glorious listen.So Aileana leads a double life. She is the proper daughter and lady she is suppose to be during the day, and a fae hunter by night. She goes against everything that she is suppose to be purely because she wants revenge. A fae murdered her mother right in front of her. She wants to kill her in the least, probably torture to the greatest. \"Crimson suits you best.\"She is being trained by the exactly thing she hunts, a fae named Kiaran, in how to survive, and she has a little pixie named Derrick who helps mend her clothes for a cost (side note: Derrick was my favorite part of this whole book. He's hilarious and I need a pixie in my closet).There is romance in this book, though it isn't the main focus. I will say that there is another Buffy the Vampire Slayer reference towards the romance side, you know the whole \"forbidden\" and \"I hunt your kind, you kill my kind\" type of deal.I loved the fact that we didn't start out with her being oblivious to the world and not knowing what she is doing and all of sudden she is so great and wonderful and spectacular at this random thing that dropped in her lap and blah blah blah blah. Insta-stars are so annoying.She has been doing this for a while and she knows what she is doing and she trained her butt off to be as good as she is.It's a great read for anyone who loves things about Seelie Court and the Unseelie Court things. I can tell we are going to expand on that in the next books. Basically if you love fantasy, steampunk and just kind of BA things, this book is up your alley and you should read it so we can discuss it!WrensReads | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram"}, {"userName": "Elise \u2718 a.k.a Ryder's Pet \u2718", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13567836-elise-a-k-a-ryder-s-pet", "userReview": "What the hell was that kind of a ending?

The first time I read The Falconer I couldn't move past 15% of the story, because steam-punk part kept driving me nuts. I think it's clinical. Me and this genre exist in different universes and we can't find a way to tolerate each other. This time, I decided to clench my teeth and fight through my dislike. I read negative and positive reviews on this book and after finally reading the named book, I can say that the positive side wins, for me. I really am not in the mood to write a big review (reviewer's slump?), so if you want a more thorough opinion, I advice you to read my friend Katerina's review.The Falconer is not an original story, moreover, I know that it resembles Darkfever a lot. I haven't read that popular series yet, but supposedly Elizabeth May did and is a fan of the series, then she decided to write some kind of a fan fiction. I must add that it was a good idea in this case, because The Falconer is a rich entertaining story. I don't know how I will feel after reading the original, but so far I am mostly satisfied with everything. My only major problem was a relationship between our MCs: Aileana Kameron & Kiaran MacKay. I think their romance was rushed and appeared out of nowhere after the 60% of the book. First they just trained together and had strictly business relationship. Kiaran was cold and asshole-ish and he NEVER showed any interest in Aikeana except for her fighting skills. Aileana saw his unearthly beauty and found him alluring, but she understood it all had to do with his Fae powers. No romantic thoughts there. But then the switch clicked and Aileana started to swoon over Kiaran, thinking how she could save him and all. And Kiaran out of thin air became goody two shoes. Seriously, guys, THAT was strange. I didn't have time to comprehend their romance or to be invested in it. Maybe it's just me and my perception.One of the best things about this book is, strangely, not the MCs but the secondary ones. We have a very funny pixie called Derrik. He likes to talk a lot and is easily drunk on honey, so you better hide it if you have any:At that precise moment, Derrick barrels through the ballroom doors, bright as ever. He hovers above my shoulder and lands gracefully on my bare skin.His wings graze my neck and he hiccups once. \u2018Glorious lady.\u2019 He stretches across my collarbone. \u2018I have consumed \u2013\u2019 hiccup \u2018\u2013 wondrous, splendid, beautiful honey. And it was \u2013\u2019 hiccup \u2018\u2013 magnificent.\u2019And then there's Gavin. He is supposedly a second love interest, but worry not - no real triangle there. But Gavin was a very interesting character and I wish he had a bigger place in the story. This book has a really likable male characters whether they fae or human. One particular scene made me laugh for a few minutes non-stop:\u2018For once, I agree with the Seer,\u2019 Derrick says. \u2018Keep your distance, or I will bite you.\u2019Kiaran picks up my drawing. \u2018Try it and I\u2019ll pluck your wings off and feed them to you.\u2019Derrick hisses. Gavin just looks interested, as if wondering whether such a thing might be possible.Ahaha, I see these three will became great friends in the future.Anyway, in the case of this book, I don't really have an opinion to read or not to read. You can give this book a try and see how it goes. At least, some moments for sure will brighten your day."}, {"userName": "Gabry", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33245151-gabry", "userReview": "Scozia, fate, protagonista femminile badass fin dalla prima pagina ed una fata maschio dagli occhi viola, misterioso e bellissimo.

THE FALCONER is a highly intriguing tale filled with spirit and delightful twists!While her father plans her betrothal, Aileana has plans of her own, plans of revenge against the faery that killed her mother right before her eyes and she is the only one that knows of their existence. A square peg being forced into the round hole of obedience and subservience, Aileana has a secret or two she keeps close to the vest. She has also discovered she is the last of her line, a Falconer, a female warrior born with the gift for hunting and killing the fae. Without her, humanity faces total inhalation as the hands of the fae.Her mentor of sorts is one of fae, the exiled Kiaran, a moody and terse young man who knows no boundaries, is merciless on Aileana and has her heart in a complete uproar. Since when did Aileana get all soft over a male? Add to the mix, the adorable little pixie, Derrick and a best friend who covers for her eccentric behavior while being clueless as to why, some brilliant steampunk creations made by Aileana, herself and one can hardly avoid being drawn into this fascinating tale. Has Aileana\u2019s heart gone cold? Her quest for revenge is brittle and icy, her mission is clear, but life is never easy and this young woman\u2019s life is split in two, the one she needs to live and the one the world expects her to love. Rather like David and Goliath, Aileana will have to stand tall against evil and not get caught by humanity.A perfect read for young adults, there is attitude, the quest for independence and being trapped in a world filled with \u201crules\u201d she can only try to abide by. From the steampunk to the fae, this feisty heroine is a fresh change from angst-filled young adult fantasies in every way!I received this copy from Chronicle Books in exchange for my honest review.Series: The Falconer - Book 1Publisher: Chronicle Books LLC (May 6, 2014)Publication Date: May 6, 2014Genre: YA Fantasy | SteampunkPrint Length: 323 pagesAvailable from: Amazon |\u00a0 Barnes & NobleFor Reviews & More: http://tometender.blogspot.com"}, {"userName": "Cait \u2022 A Page with a View", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47412532-cait-a-page-with-a-view", "userReview": "Steampunk Scotland + faeries is what drew me in and I really, really wanted to love this book.

Set in 1844 Edinburgh, this story does contain Victorian-era elements such as balls and stringent social expectations, but it is definitely not your typical historical fiction. It\u2019s a world filled with evil faeries and exciting steampunk inventions. And Aileana, the protagonist, isn\u2019t you average debutante either. She has recently witnessed the death of her mother and this has left her filled with a desire for retribution against the fae responsible.Aileana is the type of strong female lead I love. She\u2019s intelligent, witty, and kicks ass. However, she is not made out to be invincible, altruistic, or heroic. She\u2019s not perfect and at times even fails. There\u2019s a depth to her that feels real, not contrived or clich\u00e9. She relishes in vengeance- in killing. And although she may question whether she is a monster, she is ultimately un- apologetic about it. She\u2019s determined in her goal, and creates steampunk-esque inventions of death to aid her endeavors. But it takes more than a lust for killing and innovative weapons to defeat the fae (also called s\u00ecthichean) in this world. They are a formidable race that ranges from seemingly harmless pixies to the bloodsucking Baobhan Sith. Luckily, Aileana is not alone- introduce Kieran. The only thing I like more than tall, dark, and brooding is tall, dark, brooding AND fae. Kieran is dedicated to wiping out his kind and acts as Aileana\u2019s mentor. He\u2019s aloof and hard to read, but we do get rare glimpses of emotion. Glimpses that intrigue the reader as we are left pondering his motivations for most of the book. Likewise, Aileana questions Kieren\u2019s behaviors and past as she struggles with her growing feelings- feelings that come to conflict with her need for vengeance. And while romance may not be the main focus of the book, there is a sweet undercurrent. It\u2019s a drawn out tension that makes your heart ache wondering what will happen next between the main characters. However, as mentioned, this is not the main focus of the story. This book is action-packed with excellent character and relationship development, world-building, and witty repartee. All the characters are varied with distinct personalities, although some are more likeable than others. And while I\u2019m singing my praises- it\u2019s worth mentioning the writing. It\u2019s amazing. I was shocked to find out this is Elizabeth May\u2019s first novel. It doesn\u2019t read like a new writer, rather someone who has already mastered their field. And it extends beyond just a keen grasp of the written word. The storyline intertwines perfectly with attention to detail and world-building that incorporates what seems like extensively researched fae folklore. My one complaint is the ending. It isn\u2019t just a cliffhanger- it\u2019s abrupt. It literally ends mid-scene. I was confused and wondered if I had a faulty download at first. While this is an amazing book- I wouldn\u2019t recommend reading this until you have the sequel, A Vanishing Throne, close at hand.
