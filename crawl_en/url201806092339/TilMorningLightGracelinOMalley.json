This Trilogy pulls together all the human aspects of living in a time period of such tragedy and suffering while staying on a course of courage, conviction and love. Both to ones family, country and culture.Ireland, the Irish suffered tremendously under the rath of England in the centuries preciding the 19th, treated as second class citizens of the world. Unfortunately many died, however those that didn't forged ahead to make of life whereever was possible. And America is better for it as is Canada and Australia. The Irish are a strong breed, unbroken by the English yoke and determined in their belief of family and God. Gracelin O'Mally is a perfect caricature of such an Irish woman. Her story is a compilation of many men and women of Ireland. How they fought, struggled, persisted, lost family and friends, worked hard and always remained steadfast in their belief in advancement. Ann Moore has done a great justice to the Irish men and women of this world in telling this story. It is a story not to be missed."}, {"userName": "Lee Roversi", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3027830-lee-roversi", "userReview": "a satisfying a sweet end to a lovely trilogy."}, {"userName": "Sandra", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15086291-sandra", "userReview": "Educational, entertaining, although I hated to see it come to an end, held its drama right to the conclusion and beyond.

I'm not sorry I read it (especially since I bought it used) but it wasn't all that great. Her main character is too perfect, too beloved by all she meets. Much eye-rolling ensued. Also, while I don't mind a little anachronistic thinking in historical fiction, this author took it way too far, made it unbelievable.

I had no patience for Sean's life choices after awhile. I felt it was one big excuse after another and it tired me. I did however enjoy the settling of Grace and her children in their new home/work situation. I loved the descriptions of her cooking and her relationships with Dr. Wakefield and his sister (even though that was really rough at first). I thought it highly unlikely that Dr. Wakefield would have hired her but perhaps I just don't get the big picture with people in that time period. I felt Dr. Wakefield was trusting of someone that he didn't know, who was dirty from her travels, unrooted . . . . just highly unlikely. Things seemed a little too perfect in that department while in other portions of the story there were items that were so outlandish it was hard to believe. I do wish that we had gotten more information on Jack's arrival. I know that the author caught us upon these details but it was pretty much skipped over and told in past tense. I didn't like it that Julia kept Jack for two years. That's a horrible thing to do to a family! Life must have been very difficult then, more than I can ever imagine. I was grateful that the author didn't end the book on the page that Morgan and Grace are reunited! I was really worried about that. I am thankful that we got to see them react to one another and then see down the year's about how they loved each other. This is a relationship that started in the first book ahead of her first marriage. This was a long time in coming and we didn't want to get shortchanged! Overall a good book and worth the time to read it."}, {"userName": "Jessa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6017021-jessa", "userReview": "This was my least favorite book of the three, BUT still a great read. I love that you get such a diverse view of so many different pieces of American life at that point, but it does mean you don't get to spend nearly as long with anyone.Some of my criticisms are also because I read the trilogy over such a long period of time that I forgot many characters, and their relationships dwindled in emotional impact to me...However, one thing I will say is that you really, really do feel that you've grown up with Gracelin. She is certainly one of the most beloved characters, and even if she does borderline on TOO perfect sometimes (that's right, I said it), she's definitely the sort of person you'd like to be.Well, I'll just go spoilery. I had REALLY liked Peter, and so I wasn't super thrilled that he kind of took a turn for the worse personality-wise in this book. I get that the author wanted to soften the blow that Grace would eventually end up back with Morgan but showing that Grace never really belonged to Peter, but I dislike that. I would have liked for it to be a bumpier and more realistic reuniting with Morgan and for the closure of the relationship with Peter to be a little less easy, even if he did gentlemanly concede. I don't know. On the flipside, I would have liked Grace's reuniting with Morgan to be MORE dramatic than it was. But, at the end of the day, I love these books. I love the whole trilogy and will most likely end up reading them all again in a few years, which says a lot because I rarely reread books."}, {"userName": "Merryellen Towey Schulz", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35052590-merryellen-towey-schulz", "userReview": "Enjoyed It, but...I liked the happy ending, though the ten year jump to the epilogue was startling. It seems like there was at least another book possible with the sensation that much was left out early in the book and then the quick wrap up at the end. There were some incongruences that interrupted the flow of the story. For example in one part of the book, Grace\"s feet are described as having walked the 2000 miles from Kansas to Oregon. However, in another place, it tells of her driving the wagon over those same miles. Hmm. It also seems like there was a lot of story left out regarding the family's stay in Kansas. Grace seemed to have extraordinarily good luck in the people she met and the opportunities they provided for her. But that is fiction. I was left wondering how it was that Grace and Morgan had no more children after they were reunited. What did Morgan do for a living in San Francisco? Where did they live? With its gaps and all, I still enjoyed the third book in the trilogy as I was vested in the characters from the previous two novels."}, {"userName": "Kathy Maggiacomo", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3860192-kathy-maggiacomo", "userReview": "I read this book without having read the first two and I really enjoyed it. I liked the characters and I liked how the people all connected. Mostly everything that the reader will wish to happen does. I also enjoyed this book as a historical fiction. In school, I learned about the Irish Potato Famine and also our own country's Civil War but I like how novels personalize these events. It makes me very grateful to live in a time and place that I do but I also enjoying wondering if I could have lived a life like the characters in different times. Grace is a very strong independant female character and later her daughter is as well. I liked how the story unfolded and how you can almost understand why certain characters carry the opinions that they do. I guess I'll have to read the first two books now. :)"}, {"userName": "Sherry H", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4323836-sherry-h", "userReview": "Well, hmm.I couldn't put down this trilogy - read them one after the other. They were un-put-down-able. However.There are several problems with this, from my perspective, none of which I can cover in a review without spoilers, so I won't. While I always wish, when a book or series I've really enjoyed comes to an end, is that I could know the ultimate outcome... know what happens ten years or more down the road... know that hardships are overcome, marriages are happy, families are reunited, children are brought forth, etc. Imagining those outcomes is fun, but sometimes I just really want to KNOW.Lesson learned here: No, I don't. Because this one provided all of those long-range answers. And it lost stars in the process.

I liked this book, though not as much as the first book. There were a lot of realistic elements in it which I thought portrayed the lives of the imigrants and what they had to go through, even after they reached America, really well. That being said, there were a lot of real life elements in there, violence, prostitution, language, etc. That some might be opposed to reading about. There were a few sexual things in there too, that I didn't think fit under the \"just the way life was\" catergory. I didn't think those needed to be in there. Which makes the book probably a PG 16-18. But over all a good story. I'll read the third one."}, {"userName": "Meagan", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/761630-meagan", "userReview": "This was the final book in the Gracelin O'Malley Trilogy and it was just as amazing as the first two. (Gracelin O'Malley and Leaving Ireland.) The last book left off with Gracelin and Mary Kate in New York and \"Til Morning Light\" picked up with them arriving in San Francisco for Gracelin to pursue marriage with Captain Reinders. I learned so much about the early settlers in California and the ever constant struggle for the new immigrants to make new lives for themselves despite the predjudices against them.

Gracelin's journey is captivating. I even have a quote I love, though it is in the first one: \"God does not cause the misery in our lives, He is our path through it\" The ending was definetly happy/feel good, but what is wrong with that. It was very fluffy, an easy read. It is nice to read something that is uplifting. I liked Gracelin's character very much. She is plucky and determined. Her character acts as a background for the other characters to play off of. She is steadfast and this allows some of the other characters to have more grit. All around a very fine read."}, {"userName": "Charlotte", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/251293-charlotte", "userReview": "Though I picked up Grace O'Malley thinking it was a book about Ireland, it was so much more. Moore was able to weave in so many facets of life from the 1840s- 1860s; the Famine and the relationship between the Irish and the British, the immigrant experience aboard ship and on both coasts, slavery, religions, photography, shipping, opium use, etc etc. It seems as if no rock was left unturned by this talented author, yet nothing seemed forced or out of place.

I wanted to read far more about Grace's reunions with her loved ones, and didn't like the stories of the Wakefields all that much.
