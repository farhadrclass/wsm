Based on the title and subtitle, I expected it to be a series of interviews with famous athletes. Instead it seemed to ramble all over the place. Indeed there is a plan to this book, but it would be better described by the title, \"What It's Like to Be John Feinstein: Behind the Scenes With Me As I Wrote All My Other Books.\" Feinstein reminisces about writing \"A Season on the Brink,\" \"Hard Courts,\" \"A Good Walk Spoiled,\" \"A Civil War,\" and many others. The last few chapters revisit some of the people he interviewed in those books to find out what they are doing now. While I originally wondered why someone would think we wanted to read this kind of blow by blow view of authorship (\"I got an idea. I pitched it to my agent. I got an advance. I started calling people...\"), once I relaxed and just went with the flow, I found the book extremely entertaining. Feinstein is at heart a storyteller, and this book is like you are sitting around with him after dinner, and he says, \"That reminds me of the run-in I had with the stuck-up officials at Wimbledon,\" or \"Did I ever tell you how I got harrassed by the Czech KGB for researching a story, and got detained and interrogated, and threatened?\" or, \"You heard Bob Knight had a temper? Well, let me tell you about Bob Knight and his temper.\" Along the way there are, as advertised, some up-close portraits of great athletes, but the main character remains John Feinstein. But so what? If he were at my dinner table, I would ask him to keep telling another one, and I would invite him back. Boys and girls all over the country dream of growing up to be sports stars. This is a book to make you want to grow up and be a sports reporter, at least if you can be as lucky and privileged as John Feinstein."}, {"userName": "Mike Kennedy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7352820-mike-kennedy", "userReview": "John Feinstein is the greatest author/columnist in sports, just ask him. His ego aside, he does know how to write an interesting book. The first four hundred pages revolve around the first ten books he wrote and the stories behind them. He spends a lot of time on the book that made him, \"A Season on the Brink.\". Having never read this book, it was really interesting to see how Knight (thank god he isn't here to choke me) ran his program and how self centered and arrogant he was. I found myself on the outside looking in a few times having not read all of John's books, although for the most part the stories stand on there own with a little background from John. The last hundred pages are follow up on the people in his book. I found this section hit or miss. It was frustrating when he teases interviews with Ivan Lendl and John McEnroe, but only goes on to give you the story of the Lendl interview. This epilogue was moving as he spoke about the great bond at the service academies, and how their teams are truly like a family. Overall I like this book, although I could have done with a little less of John's ego."}, {"userName": "Peg", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3619122-peg", "userReview": "One on One: Behind the Scenes with the Greats in the Game by John Feinstein. This book was provided to me free-of-charge by GoodReads, FirstReads. I never got around to marking it as \"currently reading\" because I read it a little at a time since it was easy to put down and then pick up again. This book has over 500 pages, so doing it that way I was able to read other material during the time span I spent on 'One on One.'I am a sports fan but not a fanatic one. I feel that anybody who is even remotely interested in sports will enjoy this book. It covers lots of sports, i.e., tennis, baseball, golf, football, college basketball, etc. It's obvious that Mr. Feinstein has written about sports for a long time, does lots of research, therefore knows what he is writing about. His access to coaches, players, etc., is amazing! The behind-the-scenes are incredible reading, very interesting and most enjoyable. This book is highly recommended. Since I grew up in southern Indiana, I am a huge fan of Indiana University in Bloomington. The segment about the basketball season spent with Bobby Knight and the IU team was very entertaining for me."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2266806-erin", "userReview": "I received a free copy as part of the Goodreads First Read Giveaway.This is really a book for sports fans. Everyone else will be rather bored. I first heard of John Feinstein when my brother asked for \"Hard Courts\" for his birthday. My family is obsessed with tennis and everyone plays tennis (except for me). \"Hard Courts\" is all about tennis and includes extensive interviews with players. It is one of my brothers all time favorite books. So, this book will be re-gifted to that person in my life and I will be the favorite sister. Feinstein includes a section on tennis, including some amusing stories about Ivan Lendl, baseball, golf, football, and baseketball. He really includes details and conversations that the typical fan would never been able to have. I thought this was well done and included information about a wide variety of sports. I liked the tennis section the best and really don't care about the other sports too much although I found the information interesting."}, {"userName": "Katelyn", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7107027-katelyn", "userReview": "When I signed up to win this book, I had planned on giving it as a gift. That didn't work out however, so I ended up winning it and having it to myself! I was hesitant to read it, because although I watch college sports, I don't believe I'm an avid enough fan to read a 500 page book about it. But I decided to try it anyway, and I am glad I did.This book was not filled with endless statistics, or play by plays that could have been hard for me to get through. Instead, it was a well written memoir of John Feinstein's best encounters in the past few decades. Overall, this book was a good overview of the adventures he most surely goes into more detail with in his other books.

Feinstein recounts his early career as a sportswriter, how he came to write Season on the Brink, and how its success led to his other books on various sports. The book needed better editing though. There were a couple of rather big errors early on and Dan Dakich's name was mispronounced throughout the audio.

The author, John Feinstein, is arguably one of the greatest, most hard-nosed, in depth and nicest reporters of all time. The man is trusted by all in sports, and it shows in this book. He has been able to go where no other but few have gone. Most of the people who are present on the list are Presidents. To say that this man loves what he does is quite possibly the understatement of the century. But back to the book, on the cover of the book as a subtitle it says \u201cBehind the scenes with the greatest in sports.\u201d This is not a misleading title. But the fact that he has been able to connect with the athletes on a writers level, and also an emotional level, is just astounding to me. He seems to be able to find and speak to the greatest men at what they do. But this is no newspaper article; this is no 500 page interview. This is information behind the scenes of such sports as Golf, Basketball, Tennis, Football, Baseball, and Hockey. With the exception of Soccer he has covered all of the biggest sports in the world. This is going where no man or woman has ever been able to go. This is spending a year with the great and terrible Bob Knight. This is 5 hour long drives with Dean Smith. This is spending weeks in France with John McEnroe. This is spending time with the late and great Jimmy Valvano. Feinstein has drawn the picture that so many of us have been waiting for. The things we don\u2019t see on the television, the newspaper or on the internet. With one book cover to cover, he has changed the way I will view sports forever. But more impressive than the book, are the lengths he went through to be able to write this story. Dodging angry players, angry coaches, endless PR people, and a few punches he has produced sports literature gold. This is quite widely considered by many experts, to be one of the greatest books to ever be written and categorized in the sports section. But keep in mind; this is not Feinstein\u2019s first rodeo. All of his books are held to an almost unparalleled standard and he could be, as he is a reporter, one of the greatest sports writers of all time. This book is a must read for anyone who considers themselves a well-rounded sports fan."}, {"userName": "Dave", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6790690-dave", "userReview": "For any true sports fan, especially any multi-sports fan, this is a must read. It is great insight into the people that make various sports what they are.I hear the criticism from some of the others who have read the book about Feinstein's ego showing through. It has some autobiographical aspects, so I would be surprised if it didn't have some of that showing through. But his insight into some of the leading personalities is great.I liked his 10-25 years later follow-ups, except for his follow-up on Tiger Woods. All of the other follow-ups were based on actual meetings, or at least encounters (Bobby Knight) in an attempt to follow-up. (I especially loved the academy, Patriot league, and Dean Smith segments.) But c'mon John - Earl Woods is dead and buried, and your diatribe about Tiger was based on public information, not any special insight or access that you had.I really liked the ending for two reasons. One, the decision to not end the book on a sour note about Bob Knight - Two, the stories were great!Even if you have issues with the ego aspects that come through, this book is well worth the read because of the insights that come into it.Also - I listened to this book in the audio version. David Devries does one of the best jobs I have heard on an audio book, almost in a league with Jim Dale of Harry Potter fame."}, {"userName": "Motez Bishara", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24310323-motez-bishara", "userReview": "I'd say this one is a solid 4.5 stars. I've read a half-dozen Feinstein books over the years, starting with the classic 'A Season on the Brink' while I was still in high school. Feinstein is a terrific writer, but is, first and foremost, an outstanding reporter. There are not many reporters left who focus almost exclusively on books (Bob Woodward is another that comes to mind), and in this era of the 140 character blasts and barking heads on sports talk shows, Feinstein is true throwback. One on One details how the writer started his career and formed relationships with most of the top names in sports. He's sat down with everyone from Tiger Woods to Serena Williams to Coach K and of course, Bobby Knight. Reading about his methodology is worthwhile for anyone interested in sports writing, but especially those starting their careers or education in the field of journalism. Ever wondered how to get into the tough to crack player's lounge at Wimbledon for an interview? It's all in here and more, with a lot of laughs along the way. My one slight criticism is the author's fascination on the armed forces sports teams drags on a bit, but hey, it's his passion and we're along for the ride. Just about every Feinstein book is worth reading, and this one is close to the top."}, {"userName": "Scott", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12020580-scott", "userReview": "Feinstein is a massive name in sports writing, but I hadn't read a single one of the many books that he's written in the past 25 years. Still, as a general sports fan, this was a really interesting read. He focuses on a handful of the games that he's most passionate about - college basketball and football, and professional golf and tennis. He throws in some baseball, too. Some of the people he's interacted with are lovable, some despicable; nearly all are engaging. Even more interesting than the seemingly endless array of amusing anecdotes are the insights that the book offers into journalism in the sports world. Reading about Feinstein, a rather aggressive New York reporter, and his run-ins with various hot-heads within and around sports is an intriguing look at how a reporter goes about his job. Any serious fan of sports should read at least a few chapters of the book, as skipping the sports you don't care about takes nothing away from the individual chapters."}, {"userName": "Sherman", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2997928-sherman", "userReview": "I have read several of John Feinstein's books, the recent being \"A Season on the Brink\" but this one is definitely his best so far. A nice big hardback of 500 pages I just took my time reading and enjoyed each and every interview. It's not always easy as people think to get back in locker rooms and to get that special interview no one else can manage to get. His year with Bobby Knight was a long one but you have to appreciate the coach and what he stood for. Feinstein told it just like it was, leaving in all the profanity which Knight wanted to take out. There wasn't too many celebrities he didn't like but Feinstein didn't care for Tiger Woods that much and a couple of others. He covers all the sports, not just football and he must have felt sometimes he has the most hectic life imaginable always rushing to catch a plane or being somewhere on time. Again, a great book and a keeper for my library shelf!"}, {"userName": "Sandra Strange", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2073676-sandra-strange", "userReview": "Wierdly, I really liked this book--not to say I can recommend it to my students, unfortunately, because it contains a LOT of bad language (we're talking Bobby Knight here, after all). Feinstein is a good writer, which really captivates the reader. The book is merely his story of why/how he wrote most of his blockbuster sports books, beginning with his book on Knight (he followed him and his team around for a season), continuing with his books on golf, baseball, and tennis. The characteristics that make this book interesting include all of the stories of his contacts, pleasant and not, with the greats of these sports, especially college basketball coaches, and the relationships among them all. The book ends with a really touching incident that shows the best of sports, after showing some of the worst, as well. You don't have to be overly interested in sports to really enjoy reading about these fascinating characters and their absolute commitment to games."}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2378707-jill", "userReview": "I have read Season On the Brink and The Punch so I knew I was probably going to like this book.

Athletes, coaches and sports agents??? Half the time I was googling people because I knew I had heard the name before but I couldn't remember their face. My brother told me I was an idiot for asking who was Dean Smith. Oops. I enjoyed the journalism and behind the scene stories so much that that didn't matter.

It is Feinstein story behind the story of his first 10 books. Since Feinstein has written about so many sports, this book gives you a 40,000 foot overview of Tennis, College Football, College Basketball and Golf. I have read most of these books so it was interesting to here how the books came about and some of the problems that he ran into when researching and writing the books. It is really a collection of many short stories and interviews he did over the years. He talks some about his interactions with Bill Foster (the coach of Duke before coach K). I know Bill Foster through his daughter (who I work with) so it was very cool to read about Feinstein interactions with Foster.

At 544 pages, it was a big time investment, which shouldn't have been a problem since we both love sports so much, but I had a hard time staying interested.

Feinstein goes into great detail on what it was like to write Season on the Brink with Bobby Knight and his other books.

There were a few things that could have been altered- a few too many stories about trying to get through various sports' securities, and a comment about David Justice not being a solid guy that was never fully explained.

Since his days as a young Washington Post journalist, Feinstein has written twenty-eight books and countless magazine articles and newspaper columns, covering college basketball, golf, tennis, baseball, and very nearly every sport in between. He has told us of victory and defeat, of athletes and coaches we love--and love to hate. But some of his best stories have been left untold, until now.
