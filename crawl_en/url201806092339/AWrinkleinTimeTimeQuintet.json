I knew that \"Wrinkle\" was considered to be a classic, but I was unaware that it was considered a Beloved Classic Beyond Criticism. I read this in grade school and just REread it aloud, to my daughter. I didn't have a clear memory of it, though I remember that I loved the way it started. Now I realize why I forgot so much of it. I STILL love the first 3 chapters, and dislike the rest. But since some of you found (and WILL find, I'm sure) my review to be judgmental, harsh and undiplomatic (a review IS a critique, right?) to the point of insulting, I thought I'd do a little research, look over the book again, think about it some more. So I've edited this review. But I find I just can't retract my statements. They are my opinion, that's all, and I haven't changed my mind. I can only try to be open minded, be honest, and try to explain my thoughts & feelings more clearly. Otherwise, I'd be a simpering fake.Like C.S. Lewis books (especially the last of his Chronicles of Narnia, The Last Battle), A Wrinkle In Time has strong, (heavy-handed, I think), overtones of Christian doctrine. I'm not anti-spiritual, but I have a personal discomfort with this kind of religious doctrine. (You many not, and that's fine.) But more than that issue, the book is an odd combination of intelligent hard science, interesting quantum science that is brushed over, and quotes from the bible. At least there are a few respectful mentions of other spiritual leaders from other cultures, and moral messages from classic literature and philosophers. I understand this combination garnered criticism from both religious fundamentalists as well as atheists and secular society. L'Engle has earned my respect for taking on the difficult and controversial marriage of science and religion. She has also earned my criticism for raising this issue and then failing to really grapple with it. It's treated lightly, as though it's a natural thing that should be easy to accept, in spite of the many holes and inconsistencies in her story. I wouldn't even mind, except that this book takes itself SO seriously! It's easy to imagine that a school teacher might use this book to demonstrate that Evolutionist Theory and Creationism can be combined, but I find science and religion to have a disjointed and uneasy coexistence in this book. One is always dropped abruptly for the other. Or at least, it seems so to me. Ok. Now that I have tackled that big one, let's move on. I found the characters rather flat, (the genius child, the misfit girl, the beautiful, genius, scientist mother who nonetheless stays home and cooks stew in bunsen burners while her husband has adventures). The story itself is made up of vague scenarios of conflict of the psyche and spirit, with the entire Universe at stake. L'Engle's metaphors are obvious and their manifestations flat. [SPOILER ALERT] There is a quest to fight a \"Darkness\" (oooh!) that wants to rid us all of individuality & free will. There are 3 beings who used to be stars before they died in the fight with the \"Darkness\" and became something beyond our comprehension. They can appear in any form to us, so that we have some way of processing their existence. They are, in fact, so beyond anything knowable that I can't feel much for them or say much about them, except that they make a convenient plot device for transporting the characters throughout the Universe and the story. Anyway, the \"Darkness\" takes over a planet which turns into a kind of sci-fi beehive, with brainwashed automatons. I found the planet to be delightfully creepy and would have liked to know more about it, (even if it seems suspiciously like a thinly veiled anti-communist warning message.) So guess what's doing the brainwashing? - a giant, evil, disembodied brain, called IT, who is personally responsible for spreading the Darkness across the Universe. Really? A brain? Doesn't anyone else find this simplistic and cliche? The main character defeats this brain by gushing love. I am quite sure that many, many readers were moved to tears by Meg's gushing, but I do not happen to be that kind of person. Before Meg realizes that she has the power to gush love, the crusaders tesser through time and space (no explanation of how the father can do this) to a fascinating planet with very interesting aliens who can't see, but have other senses. I'd have loved to know more about their society and these mysterious other senses, but again, these ideas aren't very developed.These are the things in this book, and in L'Engle's writing that I love: As I mentioned, I love her courage in at least attempting a controversial issue like mixing science and spirituality. I love that this book has the heart to recognize love as the greatest power, and that it has the wisdom to recognize fear as one of the biggest weapons. I love that individuality prevails, and the romantic in me approves of the loving, whole family. I love that she has enough respect for children that she included difficult vocabulary and a few difficult concepts. Many children are far more capable of handling complex ideas than we give them credit for, especially if we expose them to these things early on. I love that L'Engle doesn't underestimate them in this way, at least initially, on the surface. Since my biggest problems with this book all involve my finding it simplistic, naive, and certain parts of it cliche & obvious, I wonder if I need to remind myself that it's meant for children. Perhaps children should be idealistic, or even naive, in the way that this book is. But then I wonder if that is another way of underestimating them. ESPECIALLY since I felt exactly the same way when I read this book as a child!Wind In The Willows makes me feel closer to God, or a creative power (though there's some gushing in there too, at the end.) The Jungle Book explores social constructs and morals, more deeply and naturally, for me. A Sound Of Thunder blew my mind, in grade school, with its \"butterfly effect\" theory of the power and responsibility of each individual. All of these are childrens' books, though they span generations, and time and space, more gracefully than tessering did for me. I could name so many more. But, if A Wrinkle In Time opened your mind to new ideas, (instead of making you feel frustrated by light treatment of them), made you question some latent prejudice, (instead of feeling bored by obvious metaphors), lifted your spirits & made you cheer for bookish outcasts, (instead of feeling that no one is that one-dimensional) or cry for the love of a big sister & little brother, (instead of cringing when a version of \"I love you Charles Wallace\" appears 19 times in 2 pages), then it is a wonderful book. For you."}, {"userName": "RandomAnthony", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/721021-randomanthony", "userReview": "So 41 of my goodreads friends have read A Wrinkle in Time, but I never picked up the book until these past few weeks. I\u2019m not sure how this novel and I slipped past each other in my youth. I\u2019m guessing that since the main character was a girl I wasn\u2019t that interested in middle school and when I grew older the science fiction elements didn\u2019t appear strong enough to snag my interest. Oh well. Last weekend I bought A Wrinkle in Time at a Borders near the Seattle airport. I wanted the novel to get me through the grueling twelve hour journey (whoo, flight delays and pre-dawn connecting flights!) home, and I thank Ms. L\u2019Engle for the perfect story for early hour near-hallucinatory reading in the middle of the Minneapolis International promenade.What makes this book so good? First off, A Wrinkle in Time works under the assumption that kids are smart enough either to grasp the nuances of some fairly deep physics or, if they don\u2019t get every detail, they\u2019ll flow with the storyline anyway. One woman I know said, \u201cI didn\u2019t understand all the science when I was a kid but I still loved it.\u201d That makes sense to me. Hell, I didn\u2019t understand all the science now, and I\u2019m (supposedly) a grown-up. L\u2019Engle doesn\u2019t just say, \u201cAnd then they traveled time.\u201d She tries to explain how time travel might work.  I wonder if so many kids, especially girls, liked this novel because they felt L\u2019Engle respected them as intelligent readers.Second, A Wrinkle in Time frames Meg\u2019s personality as multi-faceted and more complex than just about any I\u2019ve encountered in YA literature. In fact, reading this novel I couldn\u2019t help but consider her a template on which some more modern coming-of-age characters (think Harry Potter) were modeled. She\u2019s brave but doubts her own strength in an tangible, authentic manner. And her relationship with Calvin is sweet without getting all High School Musical. Third, the evil in this novel is damn scary and the darkness pure and substantial. We\u2019re talking elemental, unadulterated evil that manifests itself in the fear and conformity of those who break down in its presence. And the characters\u2019 encounters with this evil feel real. The climatic scenes are perhaps slightly too swift but the nuances of the battle fit well with a remarkably philosophical (and Christian, but in a positive way) resolution of good and evil\u2019s conflict. If my friends\u2019 reviews are any indication a lot of smart girls who turned into strong, intelligent women grew up under the spell of A Wrinkle in Time. I feel like I know them a little better after reading this novel, and I can see them all, around age ten, turning the book\u2019s pages in their rooms, feeling their own strength and potential. And that\u2019s damn cool, really, don\u2019t you think, a whole generation of girls reading A Wrinkle in Time? Maybe little girls across America are googling \u201ctesseract\u201d as we speak\u2026"}, {"userName": "Hailey (HaileyinBookland)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21937982-hailey-haileyinbookland", "userReview": "3.5*What a fun weird little story!"}, {"userName": "Zo\u00eb", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9303625-zo", "userReview": "3.5/5"}, {"userName": "Elyse", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse", "userReview": "Am I the first living 64 year old who had never read this book- until now - March, 2017. that is? Random Thoughts .........I was surprised to discover this story was about a little GIRL --not a WIZARD. .....I was more surprised that Meg, 13 years old, had three other siblings... two twin brothers, Sandy and Dennys, and a younger brother, Charles Wallace Murray, who is a child prodigy.....with parents who were scientist. THERE IS A REAL FAMILY -WITH REAL PEOPLE in this book! NOT SURE WHY THIS SURPRISED ME! .....I'm thinking \"HOT DAMN, I might like this story\".... and my daughters might have.... but as far as I know .... they missed reading this one too. Heck, the first page was 'great' - the first sentence was 'classic-great': \"It was a dark and stormy night\". What child doesn't perk up to hear a story with those first words? So....I continue reading 'remembering' that not long ago 'ELLIE' praised this book SO HIGHLY ....as her FAVORITE children's book ( she and I both have passion for the Velveteen Rabbit)....that I KNEW I HAD TO FINALLY READ IT. I bought a used copy at my recycle bookstore for a dollar. THANK YOU ELLIE!!!!! :) whew...I'm glad I didn't miss this gem!!! I loved the characteristics of the kids and adults....each unique in their own ways. .....What creative names for characters: Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Witch.... 'charming supernatural neighbors'. .....as well as the lovely Aunt Beast. The three *W* women escort Meg, Charles, and another boy, Calvin O'Keefe. from Meg's school --through the universe by means of SCI FI UNIVERSE TRANSPORTATION-- \"tesseract\" - A fifth dimensional phenomenon-- ET hasn't phoned home yet.....on a mission to rescue Meg and Charles father. Meg, and the Mrs. W's all agree that the mysterious disappearance of the father is very strange and has something to do with the term \"tesseract\". After all he is a scientist and was working on a project before his disappearance. The Trio W-women and children travel through the universe and visit different planets - a utopian world- with creatures disguised as humans. First they bump into evil... then they are taken to a woman to look through a crystal ball. The children are learning that there is both evil and good in the world. They see much darkness through that crystal ball down here on planet earth. They also see that artist's, and philosophers, and religious folks are fighting against the evil. AT THIS POINT IF I WERE A CHILD - I WOULD HAVE QUESTIONS -- THE CHILD ME WOULD ASK: \"well, my daddy died--[I was 4]. I'd want to know if he left me because he got tired of all the fighting on earth--and since I've always wondered since the day he died -- not knowing what the hell that meant -- if he was coming back soon --- and could I go on the mission with Meg and bring my daddy back home too?\" This book might have scared me as a child -- I would have needed a tender adult reading it with me. ON WITH THIS STORY: They soon travel to a planet called Camazotz.... where they find Meg's father: trapped! The planet is being controlled by an evil brain and with powerful telepathic abilities- called \"IT\". This story begins to gets MORE SCARY..... I would have been on the edge of my seat. Note: I don't read much science fiction - but the children are threatened by the possibility of their minds being controlled through a telepathic takeover. Whew..... laughing ....I was exhausted by the end.....OF COURSE IT HAS A HAPPY ENDING.... I HATE that felt like crying in this children's book! I hate all you people who told me it's a must read .....because for this girl it WAS!!!!!! I LOVED IT!!! - you mean people!!! I love believing there is GOOD in the world .. so why am I sad? A special appreciation to the Goodreads community-- I might never have read this book without all the the LOVE & EXPRESSION for this children's classic! Thank you!"}, {"userName": "PurplyCookie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2214498-purplycookie", "userReview": "The story takes about 100 pages of tedious, banal dialogue, to get to the point where you are told that this is a battle against Evil, and all you need is love. But everything is so oversimplified, so sketchy--everything is reduced to big words, like IT, and evil. This IT, also called the Dark Thing, is striving to create a communist-type society where everyone conforms, down to the little children who bounce their balls in uniform rhythms and who live in cutter-box houses. I liked Meg in the beginning, she was a believable character, filled with her own problems, and I really wanted for things to work out for her. But when she went on her journey, and especially since she got to that dreadful communist planet, she got hysterical. She did not \u201csay\u201d anything for half of the book--she yelled, gasped, screamed, cried, etc. She got ticked off at everyone for everything.Then there might have been an indication that Charles Wallace was going to be a player, but he fizzled. There are constant references to him being special, but we never find out what was so special about him, besides putting a 30 year old into a 4 year old body and calling it \u201cgenius\u201d. There was all this build-up for the confrontation between him and IT, but nothing happened. He looked at the guy, let him in, and became filled with ideas from Lenin himself.Then there are worlds. These characters traveled to a planet that was described in three lines with beautiful flowers and a tall mountain. Then another planet is not described at all except to say that it was a winter wonderland type of a place. The residence of the Happy Medium was another planet where they were conveniently in a cave, and final stop was in a planet that was probably like Earth, except all we know about it is that it had rows of houses and tall buildings. There you have it--traveled all through the known Universe and have nothing to show for it. No imagination to describe and develop a world.Then there are bizarre references to god/s that come out of nowhere, or in the oddest places, and disappear into nowhere. Characters are underdeveloped; scenes are not finished; worlds are left to themselves; theme is the fear of religious right of the communist left.It's a caricature of evil, done perhaps in the belief that kids won't get it otherwise. There's not much in terms of a plot, the worlds described are paper-thin, and it shows no historical understanding, no outside knowledge.More of Purplycookie\u2019s Reviews @:  http://www.goodreads.com/purplycookie Book Details: Title A Wrinkle in Time (Time #1)Author Madeleine L'EngleReviewed By Purplycookie"}, {"userName": "Hannah Greendale", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43377498-hannah-greendale", "userReview": "Thirteen-year-old Meg Murry\u2019s house is visited, on a \u201cdark and stormy night\u201d by a mysterious stranger named Mrs. Whatsit who says, \u201cSpeaking of ways, by the way, there is such a thing as a tesseract.\u201d Tesseract refers to confidential scientific work Meg\u2019s father conducted for the government before he went missing several years prior. On the following day, Meg accompanies her little brother to Mrs. Whatsit\u2019s house and finds herself unexpectedly swept away on an intergalactic adventure with hope of being reunited with her father. Reaching for A Wrinkle in Time lends itself to high expectations. L\u2019Engle\u2019s book won the Newbery Medal in 1963, has been adapted to film more than once, and is heralded by many \u2013 young and old alike \u2013 as a longstanding favorite. But, as a first-time reader diving in with expectations fanned by the flames of so much praise, disappointment, it seems, was inevitable. To be fair, several aspects of L\u2019Engle\u2019s distinguished novel are pleasing. It opens with atmospheric writing that later gives way to fanciful descriptions. In a commendably daring act, L\u2019Engle puts forth a female protagonist at a time \u2013 and in a genre \u2013 where female protagonists were not readily accepted. Better still, young Meg is awkward and unattractive. Her looks having been traded for smarts \u2013 particularly in mathematics (an intelligence that likely trickles down from her scientist father and mother). It\u2019s easy to discern the value in L\u2019Engle\u2019s efforts to introduce young readers to complex scientific theories. Yes, she makes them easy to understand, but she also avoids the mistake of thinking too little of her young audience, holding firm in her belief that the fluidity of a child\u2019s imagination allows them to grasp concepts that would baffle most adults. Above all else, the fundamental messages of A Wrinkle in Time are lovely: light must battle dark to keep it at bay; moments of sorrow are what sweeten happiness; individuality and free will are priceless; and love is power. But . . . Meg is an irritating protagonist. She\u2019s prone to fits and over-reacting. When she\u2019s not shrieking or screaming, she\u2019s confused or complaining. The decision to go on an adventure isn\u2019t Meg\u2019s. It\u2019s her younger brother, Charles Wallace, that declares they will depart, and Meg is merely whisked along, screaming and clutching to Calvin O\u2019Keefe (one of the most popular boys in school) along the way. As empowered female protagonists go, Meg doesn\u2019t show her true colors until the end of the book. With all due respect to Ms. L\u2019Engle, her religious convictions saturate the story. Despite exploring scientific theories and naming several artists and scientists, L\u2019Engle\u2019s religion remains front and center throughout the book. The result is a title that seems better suited for a categorization in Christian fiction. Any doubt of this is dashed away by L\u2019Engle\u2019s proclamation during her Newbery Medal acceptance speech that, \u201cIn the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth . . . The extraordinary, the marvelous thing about [the book of] Genesis is not how unscientific it is, but how amazingly accurate it is.\u201d Is it a mark against A Wrinkle in Time that Christian themes pervade the book? Certainly not! But is there any indication going in that a religious doctrine dictates this children\u2019s book? None whatsoever. Finally, as plot pacing goes, A Wrinkle in Time leaves much to be desired. Halfway through the book, little has happened. The second half is slightly less uneventful, but the final chapters feel rushed and the neat-and-tidy conclusion is far too convenient. Though it\u2019s easy to appreciate the bold strides L\u2019Engle took as an author and the merit of her contribution to children\u2019s literature, A Wrinkle in Time\u2019s appeal seems to have gotten lost in the folds of time."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/88295-michael", "userReview": "[Later note: Had discussion with author about this book and why it means so much to so many people\u2014specifically women.

Clunky, heavy-handed, and as obvious in its way as The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. I was only ever able to force myself through this as an adult (having been turned off of it by a filmstrip I saw in school), and no doubt this is the sort of novel--like the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs--that must be first loved as a younger reader. Ugh."}, {"userName": "Madeleine", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1198255-madeleine", "userReview": "I have one general, self-imposed rule about reviewing on this site: I write about the books I've read in the order I've finished them. By that logic, I should be cobbling together my reaction to Hunger right now but I am so taken by this childhood staple that there's no room in my brain for anything other than uncontrollable glee over this book that another Madeleine has given to the world. I never read this book as a kid. I didn't read it as a teenager or a college student. I read it for the first time with 30 coming at me like a crazed stalker who won't let a pesky thing like a restraining order stand in the way. And that did concern me, especially after half-heartedly slogging through the first four books comprising the Narnia Chronicles a few years ago before taking an indefinite break from tackling what should have been another enthusiastically remembered staple of a young reader's diet. I was afraid that I'd completely missed out on enjoying A Wrinkle in Time, a novel that I have heard praised up and down by so many people as the prime example of how good children's literature can be. So I read it like I read as a wee lass who didn't realize that she was poised at the very beginning of what would become a lifelong pursuit of books fueled by an insatiable need to keep reading. I read well past my bedtime with one tiny light illuminating the path to somewhere magically transportive, knowing full well that the bookworm gratification far outweighed the inevitability of being a zombie all morning. I read it when I should have been doing something else as dictated by responsibility. I read to be told a story and to consider ideas I'd never come across in the world beyond two covers, sure, but mostly I read to give myself up to a writer's lush landscape, to lose myself in someone else's words. I read it to let my imagination run free through a universe I fervently and fruitlessly wished to be a part of. And my adult self was just as enchanted as my inner child was. Sure, A Wrinkle in Time has its faults but I honestly couldn't tell you what they are because I was so thoroughly entertained, so taken with these characters I couldn't believe I could relate to in a way that was far less remote and removed than I expected (which is to say, at all) that all the things my nitpicky, pretentious post-English-major self would usually hone in on paled in comparison to the sheer enjoyment of the rush of letting a book completely suck me into its world to the point where the real world could have collapsed around me and I wouldn't've either cared or noticed because I was so wrapped up in this story.On one hand, yeah, I do feel a little cheated that so much of what I needed to hear as a kid has lived within these pages all this time and I could have had such imperatives by my side to ease the pains of childhood's harsh but necessary learning experiences had I just shown even a fraction of some interest in this book. Among them: One's parents are not infallible. Weaknesses can become strengths -- nay, tools integral to besting some truly harrowing obstacles -- in the right circumstances. That sometimes you have to face down scary or unpleasant truths, and you're not excused from looking away or backing down just because the task ahead is either scary or unpleasant. It's better to embrace your individuality and not compromise yourself, no matter how uncomfortable you are in your own skin, than to mindlessly submit to the herd mentality and easy conformity. Just because something appears strange doesn't make it bad -- or all that strange at its core, after all. What things are is infinitely more important than what they look like. But conversely? This book drenched my ordinary existence with fantasy's magic for a few days, and I'm sure it'll stick with me in the days to come. My first encounter with this book wasn't a foggily but fondly recalled childhood memory that's destined to be tarnished by the darkening cynicism of the years upon revisits from my older self. I got to experience the breathless wonder of a kid discovering an instant favorite for that very first time as an oasis of sheer escapist rapture in the face of a few intense work days and the humdrum nature of routine adulthood. And it proved to me that I don't always have to be such a goddamn snob about kid lit because when it's good, it is extraordinary. (And, really, let's be honest: Younger Me wasn't exactly the sharpest crayon in the tool shed, so who's to say I would have picked up on the more subtle elements that made this such a delightful read, anyway?)Despite my natural inclination toward hyperbole, I am not exaggerating when I say I'm a little better for having read this book, one that I initially arrived at out of dubious curiosity and left in a state of giddy, childlike awe.

I mean, this reads a little \u201cold\u201d and \u201csimple\u201d but it was still such a delight to read. I will say that I didn\u2019t remember any of the religious/spiritual aspects that were woven in, so apparently fifth grade Melanie, who went to a Catholic school and everything, just pushed those out of her mind throughout the years. The basic premise of A Wrinkle in Time, that I\u2019m sure you all know, stars a young girl named Meg is one of four siblings in her family, and both of her parents are scientists. Meg and Charles are very intelligent, therefore outcasts, but where their twin siblings, who are of normal IQ, fit in just fine. One day, her father goes missing and Meg, Charles, and their new friend, Calvin, meet a very peculiar trio, who take them on an intergalactic adventure that they will never forget. They essentially travel by folding or \u201cwrinkling\u201d time. Overall, this was a super enjoyable read, that totally did give me a swift kick in the nostalgia feels. Yet, I\u2019m not sure how well it would hold up if this was your first time experiencing the story. I do feel like there is a little something here for everyone, and even though this is considered a middle grade book, I do think it holds up pretty well for most ages. And honestly?

One of the things that helps it age so decently is that L'Engle didn't have much in it that could age it. No brand names, no popular trends, no references to any politics of the day. The only stuff that really let you know you were reading a book written in the 60's were Calvin saying things like Golly! unironically or Charles Wallace being disrespectful by calling his father Pops.*snickers*It's a very simple story that I read in just under 2 hours, but I remember it being complex enough when I was younger. I think it hits all the right points for a kid who feels out of place and weird, and didn't we all feel out of place an weird at that age?Yes. Yes, we did.The only thing I was less excited about this time around were all the religious references, but the book is what it is, and you just kind of have to accept that God is a big theme in this and move on if you want to enjoy it. It's not too preachy, so there's that.Will kids today like it? I'm trying to get mine to read it now, so ask me again in 6 months.But I'd been putting off re-reading this thing for 20 plus years and was pleasantly surprised that it was still such a charming story.Highly Recommended...for nostalgia."}, {"userName": "Crumb", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53025065-crumb", "userReview": "What can I say about a book that is hailed as one of the greatest pieces of fiction of all time? Nothing. I really can't. I will not disrespect this book by saying anything negative about it. I think my opinions about this book may have changed over the years, but that by no means makes this a poor read. Instead of being critical about the book, I am going to celebrate it with some of my favorite quotes from this book:\u201cLike and equal are not the same thing at all.\u201d (No wonder this book is considered to be allegorical! Definitely some political innuendo there..)\u201cHave you ever tried to get to your feet with a sprained dignity?\u201d\u201cA book, too, can be a star, \u201cexplosive material, capable of stirring up fresh life endlessly,\u201d a living fire to lighten the darkness, leading out into the expanding universe.\u201cIf we knew ahead of time what was going to happen we\u2019d be\u2014we\u2019d be like the people on Camazotz, with no lives of our own, with everything all planned and done for us.\u201d And for my absolute favorite quote:\u201cLife, with its rules, its obligations, and its freedoms, is like a sonnet: You're given the form, but you have to write the sonnet yourself. - Mrs. Whatsit\u201d This book is a masterpiece. However, it simply didn't resonate with my older self as it had with my younger self. With that said, I can still recognize this for what it was: A book ahead of its time that was extremely controversial. It has seen much success and has been exulted by fans everywhere."}, {"userName": "Susanne Strong", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4514828-susanne-strong", "userReview": "5+++++ Stars!!!! \u201cA Wrinkle in Time\u201d. How can I never have read this before??! Have I been living under a rock my entire life? This was utterly DELIGHTFUL, Amazing, Funny, Scary, Brilliant & Crazy Bold. In short, I loved it. Ok, and I admit, I didn\u2019t read it. I listened to the audiobook, narrated by Hope Davis - and she was amazing. That being said, thank you Madeiline L\u2019Engle, - \u201cA Wrinkle in TIme\u201d was mystical, magical and nothing short of fantastical. Thirteen year-old Meg Murry and her little brother, Charles Wallace end up going on a little trip.. (without their Mum or their siblings), to the 5th dimension. Mind you, they don\u2019t go alone. They go with Mrs. What-Its, Mrs. Who and Mrs. Witch and a young man named Calvin. Yes, the 5th dimension exists my friends and the trip takes a mere second or two (see, I knew it!). It\u2019s a terrifying trip, yet they go nonetheless. Why do they go you ask? To find and save Meg\u2019s father, a scientist, who has been trapped on Camazotz for years. With help of Calvin, Mrs. What\u2019s Its, Mrs. Who and Mrs. Witch and a friend she encounters named Aunt Beast, Meg is sent off to do the impossible.Camazotz is an evil planet however, and Camazotz is being controlled by \u201cIT\u201d (not Stephen King\u2019s \u201cIT\u201d mind you), and IT controls everyone and everything and if IT gets control of you, there is no getting free. Finding the strength to fight IT takes something special. It takes something that is inside of everyone who is human. Meg just has to find it. \u201cA Wrinkle in Time\u201d surprised me. I didn\u2019t have any idea how much I would love it. It was amusing, frightening, intense, intelligent, oh so magical. I simply adored it. I wanted to get to it before the movie came out in a few months and I am so glad I did. If for some reason, you are like me and have never read it, I highly recommend you either read or listen to the audiobook. You will not be sorry. A Wrinkle in Time will leave you breathless. One minute a huge smile will break out on your face, and you will be grinning from ear to ear and then next you will be clenching your teeth, scared for Meg, Charles Wallace and Calvin, hoping against hope that all will turn out ok.

Twelve year old Meg Murry, her precocious five year old brother Charles Wallace, and their new friend Calvin meet some highly odd beings who call themselves Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which. This strange, quirky trio sweeps the children away on an interstellar quest to find and rescue Meg and Charles Wallace's missing father. They fold space and time through tesseracts (the \"wrinkle\" in time and space) and battle the darkness that has taken over other planets and shadows ours.This 1962 book is noticeably old-fashioned and a little simplistic in several ways. The symbolism and the links to religion and scriptures aren't subtle, and Meg's anger and stubbornness gets old, though it's interesting to see how those character traits can in some situations stand her in good stead. Also, in fairness it is a middle grade book, though a lot of older readers love it. There's something really lovely about the book's ultimate message and themes. I enjoyed revisiting it again after all these years.I'm going to stick with my original 4 star rating, though I'm pretty sure that the nostalgia factor is playing into this rating.

S. Lewis in my opinion. However, while the influence of Christian Theology (and in later books, biblical history) is woven throughly through out all the books in this series, it is not offensive to non-Christian readers. I am one of those. To be completely honest, when my mother first read me this when I was about 7 years old, I was totally oblivious to the influence L'Engle's faith has on her writing. It wasn't until I was twelve or thirteen, when I read the entire series several times over, that it became obvious to me. But I digress. What really makes this book (and others in the series) has nothing directly to do with the writer's faith. It has to do with the different types of non-sexual love found between family, friends, society, and the individual. I know, big thing for a Children's novel, but it generally is shown rather then told thereby allowing young children to learn by example.Going back to the faith thing for half a second, it's like a large parable for how the New Testament (Protestant Christian, any how) advises people to form relationships and maintain them. We are to love and respect our parents, even when the world doesn't. Meg believes in and loves her father, even though he has some odd theories and has been missing for years. We are to care after our siblings regardless of personal quibbles, again like Meg and her brothers. WE are to show compassion for our neighbors despite what other members of our society think (See Calvin's friendship with Meg and Charles) and To care for them even though it might mean personal risk, as in some of the later scenes. Over all, it demonstrates a non-sexual love as one of the most powerful forces in the Universe. And this is a moral lesson that every faith can embrace."}, {"userName": "Jasmine from How Useful It Is", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4467515-jasmine-from-how-useful-it-is", "userReview": "About: A Wrinkle in Time is a children\u2019s science fiction written by Madeleine L\u2019Engle. It was published on 3/15/1973 by Yearling Books, paperback, 211 pages. The genres are children\u2019s, science fiction, and fantasy. This book is intended for readers ages 10 to 14. This book belongs to a series of 5 books.My Experience: I started reading A Wrinkle in Time on 3/13/18 and finished it on 3/16/18. This book is fantastic! I love the characters! They all have unique personalities. I like the twin\u2019s good sense of humor. I like their easy going intelligent parents and the oddities of Meg and Charles Wallace. I like that despite the characters being super smart, that they seem to have a disability in others. Charles Wallace is a genius but he didn\u2019t speak until he was 4 years old. Meg is excellent at math but she is a trouble student at school. It\u2019s a good reminder that even geniuses are still not perfect. I read this book to watch the remake of A Wrinkle in Time. I have seen the old version of the movie years ago and some events came back to me as I read this book.This book is told in the third person point of view following Margaret (Meg) Murry as she experiences one of the lowest days of her life. Her grades are suffering, the mean girls at school are saying she\u2019s acting like a baby, and she has gotten herself into a fight to protect her youngest brother, Charles Wallace though her middle twin brothers, Sandy and Dennys weren\u2019t appreciative of her efforts. Now the storm is scaring her. The storm brought in one of their new strange neighbors, Mrs. Whatsit. To Meg and her mom\u2019s surprise, Charles Wallace already gotten acquainted with the new neighbor. Mrs. Whatsit said a tesseract is real and it brought on a whole new adventure for Meg and Charles Wallace. This adventure involves rescuing their father, a renowned physicist. With the help of Mrs. Whatsit and her two friends Mrs.Which and Mrs. Who and Meg\u2019s classmate, Calvin, they were able to travel by tesser to far away planets.A well written story, this book is full of adventures and wholesome characters for readers. I love the illustrations in this book that explains how traveling through tesser works. I like the mathematical references and the mentioning of Einstein. I like how Meg\u2019s dad spent time to teach Meg math shortcuts and the periodic table of elements. I like Charles Wallace and his interest in higher learning at such a young age. I like the glimpse of Camazotz\u2019s citizens, how everyone doing the same thing in a rhythmic motion. This book has a good family dynamic and the curiosity of the mind and I highly recommend everyone to read this book!Pro: fast paced, page turner, easy to read, family oriented, other planets,Con: noneI rate it 5 stars!***Disclaimer: I borrowed this book from my local public library and my opinions are honest.xoxo,Jasmine at www.howusefulitis.wordpress.com for more details"}, {"userName": "Evgeny", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9340136-evgeny", "userReview": "[A fallen star doubling as flying horse pretending to be an old eccentric lady as one example (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Bryon", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1004220-bryon", "userReview": "I started reading \"A Wrinkle In Time\" when I was 8 or 10. I say started because I never finished it. I can't remember exactly why, but I think it kind of scared the crap out of me. Now, 15 or 17 years later, I've read it again (this time the whole thing) and there's really nothing scary at all about it. It's possible that, as a kid, I was somehow relating this book to the terribly scary Disney movie \"Something Wicked This Way Comes\". Again, I don't know why.Whatever the reason for my fears, the book is not spectacular. Maybe I can't see it now being older and not reading through the eyes of a child, but I can't understand how it won the John Newberry Medal. The witches were plastic and seemed to serve little purpose; the bad guy, a concept embodied in a shadow, had no motivation (if you want to read about true darkness for the sake of darkness/nothing for the sake of nothing, pick up Michael Ende's \"The Neverending Story\"); and the father, who seems to have no backbone and no sense of decency when it comes to saving his son. It has been said that the father character is an excellent tool in showing children that parents do not always have the answers, that they are, in fact, fallible and (God forbid) imperfect. But it's so much more than that. He comes across as weak, helpless, foolish, and even heartless at times. If you want to write a story where a child finds out that his/her parents aren't perfect, you don't have to make the parental figure a cold, bumbling idiot. Unless that's what you're going for. And I certainly don't think that L'Engle was. But all that aside, why would you even want to tell that story? Part of the beauty of being a child is you get to hold onto the illusion that mom and dad are Superman. Why ruin that? Granted, some kids live in terrible families, but there are better ways to write about those scenarios. This is not it.I wanted to give this book 2 stars but decided that, because of my jaded, critical age I cannot judge too harshly. Plus, I did like the savant character of Charles Wallace. He was cute. As was the love that Meg and him shared. Calvin, on the other hand, was a complete throwaway character.If I had kids, would I push this book on them? No. If they picked it off my bookshelf and started reading it, I wouldn't stop them. But I'm not about to recommend it to anyone young or old.

A Wrinkle in Time is a very nice tale, but I just wish L'Engle spent more time developing the settings. The decently rounded characters seemed to be floating in spartan landscapes like portraits hung in limbo. Lackluster description is one thing, but perhaps more than anything, I think my tepid-3 star, ho-hum reaction to A Wrinkle in Time is due to my reading it as a middle-aged curmudgeon. It's made for kids and I haven't been one of them in a while. My wife loved this book as a child and kept hinting I should read it, hinting so much that the hints became ultimatums. Could've sworn I heard her in my head shouting, \"Read this or you do not love me!\" So I read it and well...meh. I missed the age-appropriate boat on that one, I guess.

Let me be on my way. Speaking of way, by the way, there is such a thing as a tesseract.\"Meg's father had been experimenting with this fifth dimension of time travel when he mysteriously disappeared. Now the time has come for Meg, her friend Calvin, and Charles Wallace to rescue him. But can they outwit the forces of evil they will encounter on their heart-stopping journey through space?My Review: Meg Murry's daddy left home unexpectedly and without saying goodbye. The adored parent left behind an adolescent daughter, three sons, and a beautiful and smart wife. Meg cannot make herself get used to his absence and can't even pretend that she's not hurt by the town's opinion that he ran off leaving her mother. This, plus braces, wildly curly hair, an intelligence far greater than her contemporaries', and glasses, isolate the girl with her even weirder little brother Charles Wallace against their normal brothers and the rest of the world.In time-honored tradition, these misfits are actually being prepared to fight the ultimate battle of Good Versus Evil, no pressure on the children no no no, and save their Daddy, not like it's gettin' piled even higher oh no! One fine day, Meg and Charles Wallace are called to their destiny by Mrs Which, Mrs Who, and Mrs Whatsit, the eccentric old ladies who prove to be avatars of interdimensional good beings with the agenda of making the Universe safe for goodness and happiness again.The children are joined by fellow misfit Calvin, a popular boy athlete in their town whose hidden depths have tormented him all his life, in the quest to make the evil entity, a disembodied brain called \"IT,\" that slowly takes over planets and compels all life thereon to submit to being in a group mind, erasing individuality and leaching away happiness.This is a YA novel, so all turns out well, with Mr. Murry coming home and the children being brought home all safe and sound. But how they get home is very interesting: They travel via tesseract, a geometric figure that extends into a fifth dimension beyond spacetime. Mr. and Mrs. Murry have been researching this in their roles as scientists, and Mr. Murry has used the tesseract to get to the planet from which he's rescued. The Mrs Who/Which/Whatsit interdimensional beings use the tesseract to \"tesser\" or wrinkle the fabric of spacetime to get the children there as well.Fascinating stuff for a Christian housewife to be writing about in 1960-1961! And make no mistake, the book is a very Christianity-infested Message about the perils of brains without hearts leading to Communistic group-think. Mrs. Murry, a capable scientist, stays home with the kiddos and makes dinner over Bunsen burners so she can keep working while she stays home to be a wife and mom. Ew.And Meg, poor lamb, worries that she's not pretty enough because she needs braces and glasses and she's not all gorgeous like her mom is. Then Calvin, a popular boy and an athlete, shows hidden depths and falls for little Meg. So bells ring, doves coo, and hands are held, so all is well. Ew.But it ain't Twilight, so I'm good with it. In fact, because I first read it before I was ten, I'm good with all of it. The stiff, unrealistic dialogue, the socially regressive and reprehensible messages, the religiosity...all get a benign half-smile and an indulgent wink.Because sometimes you just need to know that \nsomeone\n out there believes that good CAN triumph over evil."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32799998-erin", "userReview": "I was scared to reread this book, I hadn't read it since I was in seventh grade and that was a loooong time ago. A Wrinkle in Time was the book I would read as a kid when I was in a bad mood or bored or just because I wanted to get wrapped up in the magic of another world. I read A Wrinkle in Time for the first time in second grade and it made me fall in love with reading. Of course I liked to read before then but this book turned me into the voracious reader I am today. So as I said before I was scared to reread this book after all these years given how much it meant to my childhood. I worried I wouldn't like it and I didn't want to destroy the memory of this book. So how do I feel after rereading it? I didn't love it as much as I did when I was a child but that was an impossible bar to reach. I have to admit I was very confused for the majority of the book. I don't know how I understood this book as a 8 year old when I could barely keep up as a 32 year old. I'm glad I reread it and I'm glad I didn't hate it. My childhood memories remain intact.

We also want to be ourselves and thus stand out a little bit, but basically we don't want to deviate too much because it's usually considered bad by others (funny, considering that we're pretty much all feeling the same way so we should just let the others be) and especially children often have a hard time when not fitting in with their peers. Thus, being different can be risky.Meg is a girl that doesn't fit in. Her parents are multiple PhDs and have taught her and her siblings a thing or two (about maths mostly) with the result that Meg can often not understand why she is supposed to solve a (mathematical) problem in school this way instead of that. The problem is that neither her teachers nor the other kids in school are thrilled and she is therefore subject to verbal bullying from both groups.Meg has three brothers: twins (Sandy and Dennys) and Charles Wallace. The former two know how to play the game and usually don't let anything get to them. The latter is 5 years old and usually doesn't speak at all because he knows full well that his correct and adult way of speaking - to say nothing of knowing peoples' minds - would freak others out. He prefers letting them think he cannot speak and is \"dumb\". He's also Meg's confidant and (thanks to his ability) always knows what she and their mother need.The children live in a house with their mother who conducts experiments in a room off the kitchen. Sadly, the childrens' father has been missing for over a year, leaving the family emotionally desperate. He worked with the government and there isn't any information the family is given by way of explanation. The cruel people of town speak about him having left for another woman, which doesn't make Meg feel any better, of course. In fact, Meg hates people for being so unfair and ignorant and she frequently grows impatient with the way things are (leading to her getting into trouble).Thanks to her gifted brother Charles Wallace, the family encounters a peculiar old woman called Mrs. Whatsit. The following day, Meg and Charles Wallace not only meet Mrs. Whatsit's sister (Mrs. Who) but also a boy from school - a popular boy, Calvin, who nevertheless seems to have enough troubles of his own and reveals to only be popular because he is what everyone expects of him without it really being him.To go into such detail about the children is important to me because they are the central characters. Sure, Mrs. Which, Mrs. Whatsit and Mrs. Who are important as well and the kids meet other creatures besides them, but the author managed to truly write a story for and about children.Anyway, at one point, the three ladies reveal to Meg, Charles Wallace and Calvin that they want to help getting back Meg's and Charles Wallace's father because he is in great peril. Thus, they take them on a fantastic journey through several galaxies.It's a tale of all your faults being necessary at the right time if you can apply them properly, of perseverance, love, and self-sacrifice. It's about the darkness in the world and that we can't simply do nothing, even if that might seem seductively easier. It's also about celebrating who you are instead of homogenizing the entire world.Camazotz, a world the children travel to while trying to find their father, is the perfect example of what happens when everyone has to be like everybody else. Not only does it make the world grey and dull, it also does not make the people in it happy.This is definitely a tale I'd read to my children if I had any, because it teaches so much about people, the world, perception, and looking beyond the surface. It's also about compassion and intelligence and hard lessons that all people need to learn at one point in their lives or another and the author had a wonderful way of not only delighting me when I travelled to distant planets with the children, but of also breaking my heart once or twice.I loved the prose, I loved the author's imagination, I loved the children and everyone they encountered for the colourful worlds they inhabited and their strangeness. I loved how the interaction of light and dark was portrayed, how our way of seeing the world was challenged, and the fact that the book was filled with scientific topics, explained so children could understand them. In the introduction to my edition, the author said that the book had been rejected many times, usually because nobody could tell what it was (it was as different as its main characters) and the publishers said that children would never \"get it\" - to which the author commented that children usually perceive much more than adults, and her own children (demanding more writing from her) were proof enough for her to persevere. I therefore love her self-imposed high standard to make this a tale for children, about children, that nevertheless equally thrills thanks to the adventure and educates through the imbedded facts. It is rather fascinating even though there are plenty of religious themes embedded as well (though much more subtly than C.S. Lewis did in most of his books).I have the audiobook that was read by Hope Davis and was delighted about her narration. I've listened to a number of audiobooks lately but she must be one of the top 3 narrators I've heard so far and I hope she's narrated the rest of the series as well. Because this is a quintet and while you could technically regard this as a standalone, it literally ends in the middle of a sentence from Mrs. Whatsit which caught me by complete surprise and left me wanting more (nice touch). *lol*"}, {"userName": "Whitney Atkinson", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14457130-whitney-atkinson", "userReview": "3.5 StarsAnthem by Ayn Rand is one of my favorite books, and I feel like this is the perfect kid-friendly version of that. I've been going back and reading a lot of children's classics I neglected to read as a kid, and I think they're fascinating. I see how they appeal to young readers, and I can predict how much I would have loved it as a kid, but I also catch really deep themes and allusions that I know I never would have understood as a child. This book makes so many Shakespeare references and includes such a mature discussion about conformity and knowledge, and I think it's a priceless success if a book can be compelling for readers of all ages. That being said, the only enjoyable part of this book I found was only the middle bulk. I didn't attain a particular attachment to any of the characters, and the writing style felt cozy but average. Until we arrived at the discussion about that dystopian planet around page 100, the book felt a bit aimless. I don't anticipate I'll read the rest of this series--sci-fi isn't my thing--but I did really enjoy the plot of this when we finally got to the good stuff."}, {"userName": "Jenny (Reading Envy)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy", "userReview": "I reread a childhood favorite in one night. Who can forget the cozy Murry kitchen, the way science and religion are valued equally, tesseracts and planet adventures. If a book can be a warm blanket, this is mine.When I as young, I loved Meg because I felt as awkward as her, and also as unable to grasp a boy ever liking me the way Calvin just does. But I also had those weird insights in ways not quite as dramatic as Charles Wallace, so I was all of those kids. And my Dad worked all the time, maybe not on another planet, but far enough away for my Mom to run the household, minus the science experiments and liverwurst-and-cream cheese sandwiches."}, {"userName": "Catie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1886642-catie", "userReview": "Madeleine L\u2019Engle famously said, \u201cYou have to write the book that wants to be written. And if the book will be too difficult for grown-ups, then you write it for children.\u201d I fell in love with this book when I was eight, and since then I\u2019ve read it countless times. This is a book about physics, faith, God, and the constant fight for good. And it\u2019s written for children with no apologies. The manuscript for this book was notoriously rejected by many major publishers, who believed its content would be too advanced for young readers. And now, fifty years later, this book frequently finds its way onto \u201cbanned\u201d and \u201cchallenged\u201d books lists. It contains descriptions of multi-dimensional travel right alongside biblical passages. L\u2019Engle dares to mention Jesus, Bhudda, and Einstein together in a list of humans who have fought for good. In a time when it seems like the vast majority of right-wing religious leaders are convinced that science is the antithesis of faith, this book is revolutionary. L\u2019Engle writes about faith \u2013 \u201ca willing suspension of disbelief\u201d in a Christian setting, but in a way that\u2019s applicable to anyone. The Murry\u2019s have faith in Charles Wallace, even though they don\u2019t always understand him. \u201cJust because we don\u2019t understand doesn\u2019t mean that an explanation doesn\u2019t exist.\u201dCalvin has faith in his gut feelings, his \u201ccompulsions.\u201d He has faith that he and the Murrys were meant to meet.\u201dWhen I get this feeling, this compulsion, I always do what it tells me. I can\u2019t explain where it comes from or how I get it, and it doesn\u2019t happen very often. But I obey it.\u201dMrs. Murry has faith that her husband will come home. And the three children are able to suspend disbelief and place their trust in Mrs. Whatsit.\u201cI don\u2019t understand it any more than you do, but one thing I\u2019ve learned is that you don\u2019t have to understand things for them to be.\u201dSpending time with these characters is like coming home. Meg Murry has been my literary soul mate \u2013 stubborn, straightforward, and difficult \u2013 for over twenty years. Calvin was undoubtedly one of my first ever fictional crushes, and Charles Wallace will always be my little brother.This line: \u201cCharles. Charles, I love you. My baby brother who always takes care of me.\u201d will always make me cry.Stop by The Readventurer today for a highly scientific comparison (complete with sophisticated artist renderings!) of the book and the movie.

Awesome!I love everything about this book \u2500 I love that the dialogue is old-fashioned, having been written in 1960 by a woman who was born in 1918; I love that biblical scripture was woven seamlessly throughout a story that relied upon quantum mechanics as it relates to time travel; I love that it deals with good versus evil and explains it as light versus dark in a simplistic fashion that makes it clear to children; I love the quirky characters; and, finally, I love the Murry's struggle against conformity. In an unrelated comment, it made me want to name a child after Charles Wallace, Meg's five-year-old child prodigy genius little brother \u2500 his comments on everything were precious. ;)I also appreciated the pearls of wisdom that were dropped here and there...\n\"Though we travel together, we travel alone.\"\n\n\"But, of course, we can't take any credit for our talents, it's how we use them that counts.\"\n\n\"There will no longer be so many pleasant things to look at if responsible people do not do \tsomething about the unpleasant ones.\"\n\n\"Sometimes we can't know what spiritual damage it [evil] leaves even when physical recovery \tis complete.\"\nThere is a reason this book received a Newbery Medal, Sequoyah Book Award and Lewis Carroll Shelf Award.
