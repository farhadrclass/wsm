I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name.\u201dSo begins the very first story in the very first collection of stories about Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's fictional detective with a phenomenal brain, Sherlock Holmes. A Scandal in Bohemia was originally published in \"The Strand Magazine\" in 1891, and altogether Arthur Conan Doyle ended up writing 56 short stories about his most popular invented character. It was not the world's introduction to the great detective however, as it had been preceded by two of the four Sherlock Holmes novels \u2013 \"A Study in Scarlet\" and \"The Sign of Four\". So although we tend to think of this as our first introduction to Sherlock Holmes, it is not. That honour lies with \"A Study in Scarlet\". We now usually read A Scandal in Bohemia as the first in the collection entitled, \"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\".The story begins whilst Dr. Watson is visiting Holmes, and the two are exchanging banter. A mysterious visitor arrives, introducing himself as Count Von Kramm, \"a Bohemian nobleman\" who claims to be acting for a wealthy client. However, the reader soon learns the measure of Holmes, as he quickly deduces that the visitor is not all that he seems. He is none other than Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and is the hereditary King of Bohemia. Realising the impossiblility of denying his true identity, the King reveals his face and tells the pair his problem.He is to become engaged to Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meiningen, a young Scandinavian princess. However, five years previously he had been involved with an American opera singer, Irene Adler, who now lives in London. He was now trying to recover certain letters and an incriminating photograph of the pair of them, which he had sent to her during their relationship. He had tried everything in his power, but Irene Adler refused to return them.The King says that he \"would give one of [his] provinces\" to have the photograph back\", and Sherlock Holmes is intrigued enough to take on the case with the assistance of his friends, Dr. Watson. The tongue-in-cheek dialogue between the two sparring partners is very enjoyable,\u201cBy the way, Doctor, I shall want your cooperation.''I shall be delighted.''You don't mind breaking the law?''Not in the least.''Nor running a chance of arrest?''Not in a good cause.''Oh, the cause is excellent!''Then I am your man.''I was sure that I might rely on you.\u201d Conan Doyle of course invented the names of these royal personages, which seem so much of a mouthful. Interestingly though, he placed his fictional dynasty in a real country, Bohemia, whose Austrian Emperor bore the title the \"King of Bohemia\". There was however no such place as the \"Kingdom of Scandinavia\".How Sherlock Holmes sets about solving the problem is ingenious, and sets the standard for the stories which follow, some of which are even better in my view. The plot is fast-paced, involving trickery, more than one marriage, secrets and subterfuge, a smokescreen, a street brawl, an exciting chase scene, and the use of the modern railway system. We learn much about Sherlock Holmes's unique combination of arrogance, sensitivity, and sense of humour (even though sometimes it may seem misplaced). There is a double impersonation, by which we learn that he is a master of disguise and acting, and we learn that he has much respect both for his friend and colleague Doctor John Watson, and also for a strong proud woman, who has no malice but much intelligence.Arthur Conan Doyle himself ranked A Scandal in Bohemia fifth in his list of his twelve favourite Sherlock Holmes stories. It is memorable for introducing the character of Irene Adler, the only woman who ever managed to outwit the detective. Since it is one of the first occasions we meet Sherlock Holmes, it is remarkable how quickly it conveys his character in one short story. We observe his brilliance in deducing the problem and identifying the king in the first place. We also note his arrogance and witty waspish comments. For instance when the King enthusiastically expostulates, \"Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity she was not on my level?\"Holmes replies scathingly that Miss Adler is indeed on a very different level from the King. And we see ... or perhaps a better word would be \"observe\" ... (for in Sherlock Holmes's own words, sometimes, \u201cYou see, but you do not observe\u201d) that he has a soft centre after all, by his sentiment in wanting to keep the photograph of Irene Adler in preference to a far greater monetary reward.\u201cAnd that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman\u2019s wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable title of the woman.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Tadiana \u2729Night Owl\u263d", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8734459-tadiana-night-owl", "userReview": "\u201cYou see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear.\"I'm gradually making my way through the Sherlock Holmes stories collected in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, which you can download free here at Gutenberg.org. This one is the story of The Woman.To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. ... And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.A Bohemian nobleman, half-heartedly in disguise (note the highly effective half-mask) until Sherlock, bored, informs him that he knows who he is, hires Sherlock to help him with a scorned woman who has vengeance on her mind, now that he's dumped her (because she's not of the nobility) and plans to marry a nice, straitlaced blueblooded girl. Unfortunately for the guy, she has a picture of them together, along with letters and other evidence of their illicit relationship that will surely ruin his marriage plans. So Sherlock is hired to steal the incriminating photograph.I don't want to say a lot more, because it's short and easily spoiled. It's a pretty straightforward Sherlock Holmes case, made memorable by the woman Sherlock goes up against. Despite his disdain for women generally, he's impressed ... and, to his credit, not at all impressed with the nobleman who left her. There's some great dialogue between the characters, like the nobleman and Sherlock's discussion of why this woman's evidence can't be dismissed as fake, and this interchange between Sherlock and Dr. Watson:\"By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation.\u201d \u201cI shall be delighted.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t mind breaking the law?\u201d \u201cNot in the least.\u201d \u201cNor running a chance of arrest?\u201d \u201cNot in a good cause.\u201d \u201cOh, the cause is excellent!\u201d \u201cThen I am your man.\u201d Bonus material: When I Googled to find out what a \"cabinet\" photograph is, I found this tremendously helpful page on a Stanford Univ. website, explaining not only that term but many others in the story that may not be familiar to modern readers.Next up: The Red Headed League."}, {"userName": "Buggy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3099666-buggy", "userReview": "Opening line: \u201cTo Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex.\u201dWell this was a surprise; the classics and especially mysteries are not my usual fare but due to my recent obsession with the BBC series Sherlock (How yummy is Benedict Cumberbatch) and then watching Downey and Jude Law in the movie Game Of Shadows I realized that I had never actually read any of Conan Doyle\u2019s stories. After some research trying to figure out where to begin, I eventually bought The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes and settled on this story. And wow, I didn\u2019t expect to enjoy this half as much as I did (or at all for that matter) but I guess this is why Sherlock Holmes is still relatable today.I\u2019d initially expected to have to put in considerable effort just to get through this, I mean it was written in 1892 so it was bound to be very, well literary. You know all formal and tedious. In fact I\u2019d anticipated needing a dictionary just to be able to understand what the characters were talking about, but to my surprise A Scandal In Bohemia turned out to be an absolute delight to read. The actual story is quite basic yet also filled with complexities and hidden meanings and I would also have to call this a romance -of sorts. It\u2019s also funny, relevant, cunning, witty, romantic and ultimately sad. What a great introduction to the world of Sherlock Holmes.Told from Dr. Watsons POV (now that I didn\u2019t know -I\u2019d just assumed these were Sherlock\u2019s stories.) We begin with Watson \u201cdropping by\u201d Baker Street to visit Holmes. He hasn\u2019t been by his old residence or seen Holmes of late due to his recent marriage and the two have drifted apart. I guess you could say he feels nervous about visiting because he never really knows what state Holmes will be in; elated, depressed, manic, high on opium or cocaine or in some clever disguise? It\u2019s always a bit of a crap shoot. In any case he appears happy today and also excited due to the prospect of a new and exciting case. Sherlock then asks if Watson will assist him; \u201cI shall be delighted\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t mind breaking the law?\u201d\u201cNot in the least.\u201d\u201cNor running a chance of arrest?\u201d\u201cNot in good cause.\u201d\u201cOh the cause is excellent.\u201d\u201cThen I am your man.\u201d\u201cI was sure that I could rely on you.\u201dThe client turns out to be the King of Bohemia; he requires Holmes\u2019 assistance in obtaining an incriminating photograph of himself and one Irene Adler before he marries. It seems this past affair would ruin him because of her \u201cstation.\u201d So far the King has tried unsuccessfully to buy it (she won\u2019t sell) to bribe her servants and finally even to steal it but Ms. Adler is always one step ahead. Holmes dons several disguises throughout his case, first as a groomsman to gain access to Adler\u2019s property and spy on her and then later as an (injured) clergyman. Irene Adler is a fantastic character, gaining the upper hand and in the end even outsmarting Holmes. I suppose it\u2019s her cleverness that causes Holmes to fall for her and why in the end she becomes known only as the woman.

And more than that. He's a character I'll be most delighted to make an acquaintance with. It's clear that the skills he displays in this book are only basic to his character, it feels like there's more. For this investigative episode, Mr. Holmes is contacted by a sketchy character in a mask who turns out to be a king, and is presented with a case which requires the utmost discretion and confidentiality. One which threatens to cause what will be a great Scandal in Bohemia.\u25b6 \n\nAND WHAT DO I THINK?\n\nThis was a good introduction to the world of Holmes. A light one. One thing's for sure. Mr. Holmes does deserve a place in the list of greatest mentions. The thing is, I don't know, I guess I was expecting more. More complexity? more mystery? I don't know. Just more. But I take into account that this is the first book in the series - at least I think it is. Please correct me if I'm wrong - and it can only get better. So I do believe it's going to build into a series I'll come to love. Because yes, I will be reading the rest of the Sherlock Holmes books. Slowly but surely. I might even finish them before half of the year runs out. Is that possible? I mean, I actually don't know how many books there are, exactly, so I might just be putting my foot in my mouth(haha. Foot. In. Mouth. Get it? You don't? **looks frustratingly puzzled** Well it's supposed to be funny, really.) I really like Watson, Holmes' dear, dear friend. And from what I foresee - and this is all conjecture now - he's going to be a steadfast and loyal sidekick. What's really great is they seem to have a great and adhering friendship between them. That's more reason to read more of Holmes' investigative adventures. It promises to be fun, entertaining, humorous and dare I say it, mysterious and investing. I just love great displays of friendship in books! Adding adventure to that, only leaves something that I could very well say will be the death of me and my academic life. I want to start watching Holmes' on Tv now, but there are school books with my name on them by my bedside table. Forgive me education.\u2714 \nTo Mr..

His encyclopedic knowledge and diamond-sharp observation skills make him a larger-than-life figure that continues to fascinate audiences on both the small and big screens.Originally penned by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, a physician, the character of Holmes has undergone various tweaks and changes over the years as new writers and actors have put their own spin on the famous detective. However, his ability to gather, manage and analyze many snippets of information to draw conclusions about the motives, methods and outcomes of major crimes remains constant.It is alleged that Conan Doyle found the inspiration for his most famous character in Dr. Joseph Bell, one of his medical school professors. Dr. Bell was considered an excellent diagnostician who impressed Conan Doyle with his ability to correctly \u201cguess\u201d professions, daily routines and medical diagnoses of patients, students and colleagues using bits of information that others might ignore or find irrelevant. --(Dr. Richard Hu, writing on Wired magazine.As for this specific adventure, it gets 5 stars because Irene Adler!I love the implications; with her, Conan Doyle surely manages to sidestep the blanket accusation of sexism that radical feminists love to sling against white Victorian males as a group. Hmm, but that said, I suppose Doyle might still not be off the hook, since some might still aver that Ms Adler is not represented as enough of a 'rounded' character? Oh well, Doyle still passes in my book. It's enough for me that she is brilliant. ;)In addition to that, I like that she makes Sherlock more human to the reader; that her character demonstrates that Sherlock can have human emotions after all."}, {"userName": "emma", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32879029-emma", "userReview": "irene adler is. a. baller.i'd rather read a series of books about her, personally."}, {"userName": "Foad", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25683251-foad", "userReview": "\u0627\u064a\u0646 \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u064a\u0643\u0649 \u0627\u0632 \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0649 \u062c\u0627\u0644\u0628 \u0634\u0631\u0644\u0648\u0643 \u0647\u0644\u0645\u0632\u0647\u060c \u0627\u0632 \u0627\u064a\u0646 \u062c\u0647\u062a \u0643\u0647 \u062a\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u067e\u0631\u0648\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u064a\u0647 \u0643\u0647 \u0634\u0631\u0644\u0648\u0643 \u0647\u0644\u0645\u0632 \u0628\u0627 \u062a\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0632\u064a\u0631\u0643\u0649 \u0648 \u062f\u0631\u0627\u064a\u062a\u0649 \u0643\u0647 \u0628\u0647 \u062e\u0631\u062c \u0645\u064a\u062f\u0647\u060c \u062a\u0648\u0634 \u0634\u0643\u0633\u062a \u0645\u064a\u062e\u0648\u0631\u0647. \u0648 \u062e\u0628\u060c \u0634\u0643\u0633\u062a \u062e\u0648\u0631\u062f\u0646 \u0643\u0627\u0631\u0622\u06af\u0627\u0647 \u062a\u0648\u0649 \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u062c\u0646\u0627\u064a\u0649\u060c \u062a\u0648\u0649 \u0627\u0648\u0646 \u062f\u0648\u0631\u0647 \u062e\u064a\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0639\u0645\u0648\u0644 \u0646\u0628\u0648\u062f\u0647\u061b \u0645\u062e\u0635\u0648\u0635\u0627\u064b \u0634\u0643\u0633\u062a \u062e\u0648\u0631\u062f\u0646 \u0634\u0631\u0644\u0648\u0643 \u0647\u0644\u0645\u0632 \u0646\u0627\u0628\u063a\u0647 \u0643\u0647 \u0643\u0645\u062a\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0646\u0642\u0637\u0647 \u0636\u0639\u0641\u0649 \u0646\u062f\u0627\u0631\u0647. \u0648 \u0645\u0627\u062c\u0631\u0627 \u0648\u0642\u062a\u0649 \u062c\u0627\u0644\u0628 \u062a\u0631 \u0645\u064a\u0634\u0647\u060c \u0643\u0647 \u0628\u062f\u0648\u0646\u064a\u0645 \u0643\u0633\u0649 \u0643\u0647 \u0634\u0643\u0633\u062a\u0634 \u0645\u064a\u062f\u0647\u060c \u064a\u0643 \u0632\u0646\u0647 \u0628\u0647 \u0646\u0627\u0645 \"\u0622\u064a\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u062f\u0644\u0631\". \u0647\u0631 \u0686\u0646\u062f \u0627\u0646\u062a\u062e\u0627\u0628 \u0632\u0646 \u0632\u064a\u0628\u0627\u0649 \u0627\u063a\u0648\u0627\u06af\u0631 \u0628\u0647 \u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0636\u062f \u0642\u0647\u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0631 \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627\u0649 \u0645\u0631\u062f\u0633\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0631\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0649 \u0627\u0648\u0646 \u062f\u0648\u0631\u0647 \u063a\u064a\u0631\u0645\u0639\u0645\u0648\u0644 \u0646\u0628\u0648\u062f\u0647\u060c \u0627\u0645\u0627 \u0646\u0643\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u064a\u0646\u0647 \u0643\u0647 \u0643\u0627\u0646\u0646 \u062f\u0648\u064a\u0644 \u0622\u064a\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u062f\u0644\u0631 \u0631\u0648 \u062e\u064a\u0644\u0649 \u062e\u0628\u064a\u062b \u062a\u0635\u0648\u064a\u0631 \u0646\u0645\u064a\u0643\u0646\u0647\u061b \u062a\u0627 \u062c\u0627\u064a\u0649 \u0643\u0647 \u0647\u0644\u0645\u0632 \u0647\u0645\u064a\u0634\u0647 \u0628\u0627 \u0646\u0648\u0639\u0649 \u0627\u062d\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0645 \u0622\u0645\u064a\u062e\u062a\u0647 \u0628\u0627 \u0646\u0641\u0631\u062a\u060c \u0628\u0627 \u0644\u0642\u0628 \"\u0622\u0646 \u0632\u0646\" \u0627\u0632 \u0627\u062f\u0644\u0631 \u064a\u0627\u062f \u0645\u064a\u0643\u0646\u0647 \u0648 \u0639\u0643\u0633\u0634 \u0631\u0648 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u0649 \u062e\u0648\u062f\u0634 \u0646\u06af\u0647 \u0645\u064a\u062f\u0627\u0631\u0647.\u062a\u0642\u0631\u064a\u0628\u0627\u064b \u062a\u0648\u0649 \u0647\u0645\u0647 \u0649 \u0627\u0642\u062a\u0628\u0627\u0633 \u0647\u0627\u0649 \u0633\u064a\u0646\u0645\u0627\u064a\u0649 \u0648 \u062a\u0644\u0648\u064a\u0632\u064a\u0648\u0646\u0649 \u0634\u0631\u0644\u0648\u0643 \u0647\u0644\u0645\u0632\u060c \u0622\u064a\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u062f\u0644\u0631 \u0628\u0647 \u0634\u0643\u0644 \u0647\u0627\u0649 \u0645\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0641\u0649 \u062d\u0636\u0648\u0631 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0647."}, {"userName": "Jason Koivu", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1742824-jason-koivu", "userReview": "Holmes done over by a bird?!

But this time, Dr. Watson is already married to Mary Morstan allowing changes to their \"flatmate\" relationship in Baker street. They were approached by an anonymous masked client who turns out to be Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, the great Duke of Cassel-Felstein and hereditary King of Bohemia himself. He asks for the help of the two in solving and in redemption of a specific object from the hands of Irene Adler, his former liaison, on which they had failed in many attempts. At this time, the great duke is already engaged to the young scandinavian princess and he's afraid that this Adler woman might threaten him and his marriage through the certain object, a photograph of the duke and adler. Sherlock then had a plan and used his ability of disguise to enter the home of adler and find out as to where the photograph was hidden. Using Holmes' plan and Watson's helping hand, they were successful and were clever enough to locate the object yet disabling them to get it because many eyes are on them as of the moment. They are then bound in contacting the duke and telling him that they already know the location of the photo and that they're planning to have possession of it on the following day. Unfortunately, they were unable to anticipate that miss adler was already knowledgeable of their future acts as to the previous events of deception by the tandem. As the duke, holmes and watson are at the peripheral of Miss Adler, they were shocked to have been informed that Irene has set to fly to England with the photo and never to return again. Sherlock redirected to the location of the photo for assurance and found a photo of Irene Adler in a gown and a letter addressed to Holmes saying that she's already aware of their plans and that the duke has nothing to worry about for she is in love with another man and will not interfere with his marriage unless he takes any threatening action towards her. The story ends when Sherlock asked the duke to have Irene's picture in his possession as a reminder of the woman who outwitted him. To Sherlock Holmes, Irene Adler is not just a woman, she is The Woman."}, {"userName": "Sarah ~", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9446828-sarah", "userReview": "\u062a\u0628\u0642\u0649 \u062f\u0627\u0626\u0645\u0627 \u0645\u063a\u0627\u0645\u0631\u0629 \u0634\u064a\u0631\u0644\u0648\u0643 \u0647\u0648\u0644\u0645\u0632 \u0648\u062c\u0648\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u062a\u0633\u0648\u0646 \u0645\u0639 \u0627\u064a\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0622\u062f\u0644\u0631 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u062b\u0646\u0627\u0626\u064a\u0629 ..\u0645\u0645\u062a\u0639\u0629 \u0648\u062c\u0645\u064a\u0644\u0629 \u062c\u062f\u0627\u064b ..\u0648\u062a\u062a\u062c\u0644\u0649 \u0641\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0639\u0628\u0642\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u064a\u0631 \u0622\u0631\u062b\u0631 \u0643\u0648\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0648\u064a\u0644 ..\u0648\u0647\u064a \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0641\u0636\u0644\u0629 \u0644\u062f\u064a \u0645\u0646 \u0633\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0629 \u0634\u064a\u0631\u0644\u0648\u0643 ..\u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0623\u0639\u064a\u062f \u0642\u0631\u0627\u0621\u0629 \u0628\u0639\u0636 \u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0627\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u062d\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0627\u064f \u0648\u0623\u062e\u0631\u0649 \u0623\u0642\u0631\u0624\u0647\u0627 \u0644\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0644\u0649 .."}, {"userName": "Dani Jade", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41664104-dani-jade", "userReview": "\"A Scandal in Bohemia\" is the first story in the  The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes  story collection, the third publication in the Sherlock Holmes series (after the first two novels, so the first story collection).

I\u2019ve only read one of them so far before deciding to download the \u201eAdventures of Sherlock Holmes\u201c, a collection of twelve different short stories, which can be found free of charge and legally on the website of Project Gutenberg. And I have to admit, the one I read was probably not the best one to start with when reading the Sherlock novels \u2013 it was \u201eThe Valley of Fear\u201c, Doyle\u2019s seventh Sherlock novel, and probably the weakest one, judging from several reviews and my own feeling about it. After reading that one, I quitted reading the Sherlock novels for some months, finding it difficult to bestir myself to read \u201eA Study in Scarlet\u201c, the first novel about Sherlock if I got it right. But now it has finally found its place on my \u201eto-read-next\u201c list.\u201eA Scandal in Bohemia\u201c has been the inspiration for the first episode of the second season of BBC\u2019s successful Sherlock Holmes TV adaption. By creating the interesting character of Irene Adler, Doyle managed to show another new side of the perfectly portrayed character of Sherlock (not to mention that the modernized version of Irene Adler, played by Lara Pulver, has been even more interesting and versatile with all those different sides the authors decided to allow her character to show). It is no particularly long story (approximately 8,5k words) and, thus, cannot be compared to any of Doyle\u2019s novels (only one of which has been read by me so far, a fact I\u2019m willing to change during the next time). But Doyle was capable of creating an interesting atmosphere, especially by including a lot of humorous conversations, and his writing style is pretty captivating (sort of the contrary to what I remember about reading \u201eThe Valley of Fear\u201c, but I\u2019m prepared to eliminate my poor impression of this one in order to gain a new opinion on the Sherlock novels).I\u2019d give this short story 4.0 stars, recommending it to everyone who likes reading a well-plotted crime story with interesting characters.

RTC!--------\u2013---------------------------------------------------------------------Review can also be found on my blog, Lacey Paris Books(link in my bio!) I've become obsessed with Sherlock Holmes. I watched the first episode of Sherlock on a whim. I love Benedict Cumberbatch because he played Alan Turing in The Imitation Game, so I thought I'd give the show a go. I've either made the best decision of my life...or the worst one.A Scandal In Bohemia was an automatic 5/5 stars. Immediately after I watched episode one of the show, I knew I'd found a story I adored. I checked out the first three Sherlock Holmes short stories from the library and devoured A Scandal In Bohemia in one night. I'm now determined to read all fifty six Sherlock Holmes related stories of Arthur Conan Doyle's.I love Sherlock's unique and charismatic personality! He's much different in the books than he is in the TV show, but I love him nonetheless. While I relate to TV Sherlock, I admire and aspire to be novel Sherlock! Also, I'm almost positive TV Sherlock is asexual. It's great to see some main stream representation for underrepresented minorities.I also love John! He's such a sweetheart and his friendship with Sherlock warms my heart. It seems more problematic in the TV show than it is in the books, but both are equally enjoyable to watch/read.Irene Adler is brilliant and that's all I've got to say about that. I hope I'll be seeing more of her.I obviously won't reveiw all fifty six stories but I thought it was important to document my initial arrival to 221 B Baker Street! I'm sure Sherlock Holmes will be appearing more and more throughout my reading.

He's smart, and we all know what he can know with only looking at something/someone. But I love the fact that he was bested when he least expected it, and by the least likely person. A woman. \"The\" woman. It puts an end with the idea that the detective is perfect, that there's nothing that can be hidden from his mind. Sherlock never distinguished a woman from the next, they were all the same, and saw them more like an object of pathological study than people. But Irene Adler proved to be different, and defeated him in his own game. It's a short, quick, and entertaining read.When it comes to Sherlock Holmes, there's no time wasted!"}, {"userName": "Ashrakat Deyab", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14397172-ashrakat-deyab", "userReview": "YES!! And my new favorite character is... Irene Adler! Which is a surprise since I hated her in the series. But yes, FINALLY, someone's able to beat Sherlock Holmes and it's a woman! Go go feminists! xD And can I just say that it is such a great thing that a story like this was written in a time when women still didn't have their full rights? So, Mr. Arthur Conan Doyle, you have my respect. Plus, this specific story was mostly comic relief so it was a very light and enjoyable read.Favorite quote(s):1.\u201cBy the way, Doctor, I shall want your cooperation.''I shall be delighted.''You don't mind breaking the law?''Not in the least.''Nor running a chance of arrest?''Not in a good cause.''Oh, the cause is excellent!''Then I am your man.''I was sure that I might rely on you.\u201d2.\u201cYou see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear.\u201d 3. \"He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late.

It was one that I assigned for my summer reading book group on Sherlock Holmes. I chose it because it was one of those stories what gets remade into TV and movie versions of Sherlock Holmes. So I thought I\u2019d read up on the original version. I was half surprised and half completely not at the lack of romantic tension in it. I always thought it would be weird if Sherlock had a romantic attachment to someone, but it is built into all the shows and movies so I thought there must be something there. I think what makes it so vulnerable to misconception is the first lines: \u201cTo Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex.\u201d But then Watson continues, \u201cIt was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind.\u201d I took that at face value, but apparently a lot of people still wonder.The other thing I like about Holmes, which is in this particular adventure, is that he does not always win. Sherlock has become such invincible super detective, the prototype to all modern mysteries, it makes me pleased to see that he actually wasn\u2019t written that way. He may be a cold, calculating genius, but he can still be outwitted."}, {"userName": "Saw", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69007263-saw", "userReview": "This is the book in which Sir Arthur introduces Irene Adler to us.
