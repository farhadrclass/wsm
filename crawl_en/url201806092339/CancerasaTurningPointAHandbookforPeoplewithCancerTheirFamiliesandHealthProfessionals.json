I find LeShan's \"You can fight for your life\" book more helpful and better read. I haven't taken the exercises at the end of the book but think that they might be good ones."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Barraclough", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20729640-jennifer-barraclough", "userReview": "Many years have passed since this highly readable book by one of the pioneers of psycho-oncology was published, but its message is not out of date. It challenges the narrow \"medical model\" in cancer care, advocating a more holistic approach in which patients themselves play an active role. Anticipating the large body of research in this field which has been carried out more recently, it relies on individual case histories to illustrate how \"singing your own song\" can enhance quality of life and perhaps promote physical healing too."}, {"userName": "Fran", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83835-fran", "userReview": "This book makes a convincing argument of how important a role the mind and our mental state plays in our overall well-being. It provides practical exercises to get to the core of how many of us get stuck, unable to experience the joy and vitality of life. It's not just for those who are fighting illness. In fact, if you're not struggling with disease, and practice some of the ideas in this book, you might even be ahead of the game."}, {"userName": "Sherry (sethurner)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1663390-sherry-sethurner", "userReview": "I read this book when a dear friend was dying of a brain tumor in 1997. I don't know anything much about if the mind can actually cure cancer, but I found the ideas about living the most one can and trying to maintain a positive attitude to be helpful."}], "description": "Psychotherapist Lawrence LeShan has worked with cancer patients for more than thirty-five years and his research has led people with cancer to find new, effective ways to fight for their lives. He has put his findings--full of meaning and purpose--into this revised edition that shows how psychological change, along with medical treatment, mobilizes a compromised immune system for healing. Included is a life-transforming workbook of hands-on exercises designed to help readers evaluate their inner selves and teach them how to get the most out of their immune systems by leading fuller, richer lives.", "title": "Cancer as a Turning Point: A Handbook for People with Cancer, Their Families, and Health Professionals", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/321893.Cancer_as_a_Turning_Point", "average": 4.33, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347523939l/321893.jpg", "reviews": 4, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/158153.Lawrence_LeShan", "name": "Lawrence LeShan"}], "type": ["Health", "Psychology", "Nonfiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/321893.Cancer_as_a_Turning_Point", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/271249.How_to_Meditate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1247903.The_Psychology_of_War", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/441576.Einstein_s_Space_and_Van_Gogh_s_Sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/321334.The_Medium_the_Mystic_and_the_Physicist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/293323.ALTERNATE_REALITIES"]}
