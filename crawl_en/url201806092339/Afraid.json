The Dasher/The Duke/The guy whose name appears only once in the entire book is a self-important asshole who thinks he is God's gift to the world. He is bored with women and insists he will never marry because women do not keep his interest. And no, he isn't gay. Felica (though in my mind I called her Felicia cause Felica is such an unfortunate name) had survived a traumatic childhood experienced and was saved by the Duke. Because of this, she has idolized him to a degree that made me uncomfortable most of the time but she is phobic of men. A few attempted kidnappings later along with some shocking realization that women can be intelligent, The Duke underwent some shocking realizations and had a tiny ego check. The concept that a woman has to be pure and inexperienced to be worth something did get on my nerves.Overall, a sweet yet slightly ridiculous romance. HEA is assured."}, {"userName": "Anne Neville", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4183372-anne-neville", "userReview": "Years ago, the Duke of Darlington (aka \u201cThe Dasher\u201d) found his cousin brutally beating his thirteen-year-old, half-starved daughter. Outraged, the Duke disowned her father and carried the injured girl to safety. Now, the Duke has learned that the tearful, bleeding child he left in the charge of a French convent five years earlier has turned eighteen. She\u2019s also inherited an immense fortune that\u2019s made her the target of fortune hunters. Immediately, the Duke sets off to Paris to retrieve her and do his duty, launching her in Society and securing a suitable husband. However, the young woman he finds is nothing like he expected: first, Fiona is stunning; second, she worships him as her savior; third, she is absolutely terrified of men.http://www.numbersonthespines.com/201..."}, {"userName": "Ir\u00e8ne Wadowski uliasz", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24870333-ir-ne-wadowski-uliasz", "userReview": "Une histoire int\u00e9ressante mais d'une \"gnan-gnantise\" supr\u00eame. le personnage principal masculin est d'une extr\u00eame arrogance; il se croit sorti de la cuisse de Jupiter, et que dire du personnage principal f\u00e9minin ; tellement na\u00efve et timide.
