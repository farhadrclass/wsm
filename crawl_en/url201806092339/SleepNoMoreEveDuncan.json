Haven't picked one up since then.And maybe this wasn't the right one--but...very unimpressed.There are problems all through what should be a taut thriller: a massive overdose of goes-nowhere, inane dialogue; a plotting timeline that doesn't make any sense; lead characters who do things no sane person would do; a kitchen-sink approach to cramming random stuff into the story--like a villain who appears to come from another series, perhaps just because there wasn't any voodoo in the book already. Plus--Johansen's characters never hang up a phone. They \"press disconnect\" (four times, in three chapters).I immediately remembered Eve Duncan, and her little girl, and her passion for recreating the faces of victims. Maybe Johnansen's tired of Eve and can't find anything more for her to do, but this book was a mess."}, {"userName": "Patricia L.", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6854478-patricia-l", "userReview": "The book was hard to stay with after the first 200 pages when conversations became stilted and repetitive. Some of the murders may have happened with the movement of a wand, as they were dismissed with a sentence or two, and not credible. I think I'm finished with these characters. Perhaps Ms. Johansen will invent a more believab;e plot with a new group of people, but I won't be rushing to read this author any time soon."}, {"userName": "\u2646 BookAddict  \u2712 La Crimson Femme", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3089655-bookaddict-la-crimson-femme", "userReview": "Is there life after Bonnie for Eve? Apparently so. In this latest installment in the romantic suspense series, Ms. Johansen introduces us to a new character - Beth Avery. Beth's tie into Eve is a surprise to all. It's a nice addition and Bonnie's visit to Eve is lovely.There has to be a suspense of disbelief for many of the \"woo woo\" stuff in these stories. Once that happens, these stories are quite lovely. I enjoyed this well edited if predictable plot. Joe and Eve are like a pair of comfortable slippers for me. See them together again while trying to solve a mystery is great. I'm a bit surprised how often Joe can just take off from work though. I didn't realize cops, even detectives could do it so easily w/o losing their job. What I really enjoyed about this story is the fact that there are several strong women in this book and they aren't bitches to each other. Sure, they rub each other a bit, but they aren't fighting for male attention. New character Kendra is one I really like and I wish it were true. Kendra's ability to process information from all her 5 senses is impressive and I liked how Ms. Johansen wrote her. Kendra's interaction with Eve is realistic and fun to sit back and watch. Eve's relationship with Beth is also one of realistic ups and downs. This is probably what I like best about Ms. Johansen's characters. While they may have some \"woo woo\" stuff, their actions and responses ring true to how she created them. They don't behave in illogical manners.This story is recommended to romantic suspense readers."}, {"userName": "Jodi", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/667420-jodi", "userReview": "This book will be far more interesting if you first read Close Your Eyes which she wrote with her son Roy Johansen, but you won't really lose anything if you don't. Eve receives the extraordinary news that she has an older half sister who has recently escaped the sanitorium that she has spent the last 17 years. Eve is stunned but can't help but be drawn into her unknown sister's plight, particularly when it becomes clear her sister has been medicated and hypnotized into submission for years. Her father is a man on the verge of political greatness, perhaps the presidency. Except for nagging habit of liking pre-teen girls. When a hitman goes after Eve's sister and bungles the job, a lot of other people start dying. The plot is preposterous (except for the secret sister angle) but it was fun and action-packed and Kendra Michaels, from Close Your Eyes, is a great character and I was happy to see her again. The plot may not have been so crazy if the political angle had been a central facet of the story but since we didn't see any of that, it didn't hold together for me. But since I couldn't put it down, that deserves credit too."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1781097-sarah", "userReview": "This is only getting 3 stars b/c of the suspense...it kept me sucked in. But I'm really not sure why: Johansen is getting a bit repetitive with her plots. Family member in trouble? Check. Eve putting herself in danger against Joe's advice? Check. Presidential candidate involved? Check. Crazy dangerous killer? Check. Seriously, didn't Catherine Ling just save a good presidential candidate? Guess that doesn't count since it wasn't technically an \"Eve Duncan\" book. The timeline really bugs me too. It's been totally thrown off. Eve had Bonnie when she was 16, and Bonnie died at age 7. That puts Eve at 22. I'm pretty sure it had been 7 years since Bonnie's death when the FIRST Eve Duncan book came out. That puts Eve at 29. She was with Logan for a year. 30. She finally gets with Joe and adopts Jane (little cloudy on the timeline here since it's been awhile since I read the early books)...we'll be generous and say she's still 30. Jane was 10. Pretty sure at last count, Jane was in her mid-twenties. Again, I'll be generous and say early 20s. That puts Eve at least at 42. And if I was being more accurate, probably older than that. So let's look at \"Sleep No More.\" Beth had her accident at 17. At one point, it says she's been in the hospital for two decades, which would make her 37 (although they lose a decade halfway through the story and say she's been in the hospital for ten years). She's at least a year older than Eve, so that makes Eve 36. See why this drives me crazy???And really...I could go on. Don't get me started about Catherine Ling and John Gallo and THEIR ages!!!So as you can see, I spent most of the book stewing about Eve's age discrepancy. If Johansen had put a little caveat at the beginning and said she messed with the timeline a bit (SEP did it and I was fine with it), I would have accepted it and moved on.

It really snags the reader into being fearful for the life of the young girl they've kept sedated and mentally out of it for more than a decade. One questions whether/not her father truly loves and cares for her, and particularly since he hasn't been to see her for many years because of the pressure from his mother to avoid having any ties to the girl, for fear it will damage his political career. Sort of makes one wonder how any father could be that heavily influenced by anyone to detach himself from his daughter in a mental institution to that degree. It is shocking to learn the girl is also Eve's sister, and Eve and Joe take her under their wing while trying to investigate and get to the bottom of what truly happened. I enjoyed the actual story but was not impressed with the writing style....very simplistic in my personal view, and this is the reason for only giving it 4 stars rather than a 5 star rating."}, {"userName": "Sidnie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1328906-sidnie", "userReview": "Characters are stilted and formulaic.

For years after her daughter Bonnie was stolen from her, she fought for closure. But now as she\u2019s striving to begin anew, she can\u2019t shake the feeling that something terrible is about to happen\u2014or maybe already has. When her mother, Sandra, asks for help in finding a missing friend named Beth Avery, Eve is sure that she\u2019s hiding something. It\u2019s odd that Sandra would get involved at all, and the fact that she adamantly refuses to go to the police for help reinforces Eve\u2019s suspicions that something is very wrong.Eve learns that Beth has been locked away in a mental hospital for years, which makes it even harder to understand how she could have disappeared. As Sandra reluctantly reveals small pieces of the truth about Beth\u2019s identity, Eve is shocked to discover that their lives are strangely entwined, and Beth\u2019s disappearance now puts them all in grave danger.Desperate, Eve enlists a secret weapon to pick up Beth\u2019s trail: rogue profiler, Kendra Michaels. With an uncanny ability to detect clues and solve puzzles, Kendra begins to uncover the bizarre circumstances of Beth\u2019s escape from what should have been the safety of her hospital room. Beth is on the run, and as her mind clears\u2014detoxing from the drugs that have held her prisoner\u2014she begins to see the threads of a twisted plot within the powerful Avery family, threatening to destroy Beth and anyone else who might jeopardize the high-stakes game that is already in play.My thoughts: Welcome to the 12th installment of Iris Johansen\u2019s Eve Duncan series which chronicles the life and work of Eve, a forensic sculptor. Overall, I really enjoy this series and really enjoyed this book. My only huge complaint with this book is the author\u2019s clear lack of research about what a music therapist is which I will go more into below.This book was definitely a fast read for me. As someone who has read this entire series including the Bonnie, Eve, Joe trilogy in between, I am very happy that we have finally solved the Bonnie issue and that the author is moving on. I felt the series was just getting bogged down by the the \u201cwho killed Bonnie?\u201d storyline and was losing its excitement. Bonnie was certainly still mentioned and a part of this book, but certainly not to the level as past books. I was glad that the author started introducing some new charachters in this book as well including Beth Avery, Eve\u2019s half-sister who was unknown until this book. I see this storyline developing in future books. This book also introduces us to Kendra Michaels, a music therapist, who has special sensory abilities since being cured of her 20 year blindness. I did not know that Kendra was actually introduced in another book, Close to You, I believe. Had I known this I definitely would have read this first to get to know her better. I see the author breaking off to another series starring Kendra in the future as well as she did with the character of Catherine Ling. These new characters are exciting to me and am looking forward to how they are incorporated into future books in the series.Now that we have taken care of the Bonnie situation, I am wishing that the Eve Duncan books would go a bit more back to focusing on her forensic sculpting cases. I know this is why I fell in love with this series reading about how she did a reconstruction and the case that developed from this missing person. The series seems to have drifted away from this which is disappointing.Now, all that being said, I have to comment on my huge frustration with the author\u2019s clear lack of research on music therapy and music therapists. Yes, I myself actually am a board certified music therapist (MT-BC) who works with patients in a hospital setting, so I know what I am talking about. Yes, this makes me a bit more in tune with this issue, but I think authors have a responsiblity to research and characterize people correctly. Music therapists and music therapy as a field is already highly misunderstood in the world, so mischaracterizations in popular media is not helpful. So here goes my education and advocacy for all who care. The author fell right into some common misconceptions about music therapy throughout the book. It seems that this charachter Kendra, a music therapist, has all sorts of education in psychology, etc. (PhDs), but no formal education in music therapy specifically. Yes indeed to be a music therapist you must actuallly study and get a degree in Music Therapy, not simply related fields. A very small point, I know, but it bugs me. Also the author committed a carnal sin in the music therapy world by having one of her characters refer to Kendra as a \u201cmusical therapist\u201d. This phrase drives us MUSIC therapists crazy, it is music therapy, not musical therapy. This book doesn\u2019t really talk much about Kendra\u2019s clinical work, which is fine, but also which brings up the question for me, why did she even make this character a music therapist? It seems out of place since her work in this area is not at all important to the book. Was it because music therapy has been more in the media lately with Gabby Giffords, etc? Does she know a music therapist in real life? Did she want to jump on the band wagon on other popular authors having characters in their books who were music therapists, i.e., Jodi Picoult in \u201dSing You Home\u201d, who by the way did a FANTASTIC job of realistically portraying a music therapist? I don\u2019t know the answer, but if you aren\u2019t going to do the research, don\u2019t put it into your book. Ok, I\u2019m off of my Music Therapy education and advocacy soap box . . . for now Overall, a strong offering in the Eve Duncan series. Can\u2019t wait for the next ones to come out in 2013!Happy reading,And remember,Books are Life,Heather"}, {"userName": "Madeline Dahlman", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7159634-madeline-dahlman", "userReview": "I'm even surprising myself with that 1 star rating..but I can't in good conscience say it was \"ok\"...This is labeled as an Eve Duncan novel and I think it would have worked SIGNIFICANTLY better if it had been a stand alone...the premise is that Eve Duncan finds out that she has a long lost sister, Beth Avery, who has spent 20 years in a sedated state in a mental hospital. The news makes its way to Eve after Beth has managed to escape the hospital. Without spending an hour explaining all the details that made this possible and necessary, I'll just say that the book revolves around Eve finding Beth and trying to stop the violent cycle while understanding the reasons that Beth was shut away. What ruined this story for me is the lack of believable reason for Beth AND her boyfriend Joe to go on this wild bloody goose chase. They risk their lives and careers on more than one occasion (shocker) and almost every time justify it with the reason \"I can't allow someone to have been treated like this\". Ok, that makes sense as a statement once. But over and over and over? Not to mention the 10 other characters that were thrown in the story for a small role that links one shoddy set up to another. It was like characters used as band aids for a lousy story. This story would have been ten times better if 1 of 2 things had happened: 1) Eve had always known she had a sister, loved her, but just didn't know the evil reason she was institutionalized. or 2) The story had been a standalone where the sisters knew of each others existence. Obviously, you can't rewrite the entire Eve Duncan series to include this sister storyline, so it would have to be a standalone....Iris Johansen, you had a great story idea. But you bungled it by trying to capitalize on a popular series character. You sell enough books that you didn't have to do Eve the disservice of attaching her to this mess.

In Sleep No More, she introduces a new character into Eve's life, a character who adds more mystery to the story of Eve, Joe and Eve's mother.The story is fast-paced as Eve tries to understand and relate to the new member of her family, and the high stakes game of murder intended to protect the political aspirations of a powerful family bent on burying old secrets forever. The story brings the regular \"good guys\" and several obvious bad guys together in a battle to protect Eve's new family member...though there seem to be some other bad guys behind the scenes. In the end, good seems to win, but evil is not totally erased. So, is the victory final or is there more to come?Well worth the read.

It sounded good on the back cover, kind of like a Kathy Reichs style of characters but that is where the similarities ended. I hated this book. The characters were moody and immature. At first her police officer/lover wants to be kept out of anything that would bypass the law, then he gets peeved (a whines about it for the rest of the book) that he wasn't included in the illegal break-in they conducted. Also, if a killer is after you and you know you just shot him badly enough to send him for medical help wouldn't you have gotten the hell out of dodge? He knew where you were holed up but NO, don't go back and say, \"Quick! We gotta get out of here!\" Instead take a shower and let everyone sleep through the night. Really? There were also too many characters in and out. And a Sherlock Holmes type character that was blind but got her sight back and now can use all her super senses to easily lead the main characters along is a bit silly.

This is not a book I would ever pick up on my own at the store or anywhere except in a period of bored desperation and I wouldn't recommend it. The whole thing is just one huge cat and mouse game with characters that at times were so unbelievable I feel like this should be considered fantasy. I read the whole thing going back and forth between \"good guys\" and \"bad guys\" and when I got within the final thirty or so pages the ending was still nowhere in sight. Then, out of nowhere, the finale is just thrown together and forced on the reader. 340 pages of chasing each other and a bunch drek later, BOOM it was over.

I enjoyed learning about Sandra's past and it'll be interesting to see what she does with the two sisters. What I really don't like is the jilted dialogue and personality each new female character takes on. They are always stand-offish, bossy and generally someone you don't want to be around, although Eve ALWAYS wins them over, and their dialogue sounds as if it belongs on a day-time soap opera.

Bed plumped, body supposedly beneath the covers, imagine his surprise when she was not there. Hiding in a corner and quite agile she springs at him.

Enter Eve Duncan and her mother Sandra who has an unusual request for both Joe. But, first Eve has a nightmare that takes her deep into the forest where Beth is running for her life and the nightmare mirrors the events that are taking place.

Beth is not returned to the hospital but somehow those in charge have to make it look like she was. Rationalizing that she is not capable of fending for herself and trying to understand why Nelda Avery wanted her dead, his job is to find her, take her out and inflict pain and revenge on her for escaping. No one to trust at this hospital and no one on the outside to help her. Wherever you turn all they want is to put them to sleep: some soundly and others permanently: Sleep No More: Iris Johansen.As Sandra, Eve\u2019s mother enters the picture and arrives at the Lake Cottage the events that happen will change Eve\u2019s life forever.

What makes both Eve and Joe suspicious of the conditions surrounding Beth\u2019s accident? Sleep No More: Not if the pills wear off and Beth never gets caught. Iris Johansen at her best in this first rate novel but there is much more to come.Nelda Avery is vicious, devious and smart. Anyone standing in her way will be blown away in a puff of smoke. Nelda is concerned about only one thing, her son Ricky\u2019s run for President. As long as her husband George funds the campaign he is useful. Foolish to think he matters to her and na\u00efve to think she would keep him if he denied her what she wants. Thinking about Beth and planning to meet Joe to enlist the help of Kendra Michaels Bonnie appears. As Eve talks with Bonnie she learns more about Beth, why she is being drawn to her and her need to connect with her. Knowing where Bonnie is and that she was finally brought home does not make it any easier for her nor does she miss her less.

Checking the person in the room he realizes that it is a decoy and not Beth.Kendra Michaels is devoted to her students and her mission is to help kids that are autistic and do music therapy.

Confrontations are interesting when Eve and Kendra come up against each other and Eve presents her own doubts as to whether she can help or not. As Kendra gets her back up against the wall and let\u2019s Eve know that her tactics are old and used before. Then, Kendra relates to Eve more about her own life in the few minutes since meeting her that changes her perspective. Asking Kendra how she not only knew about Bonnie, her job and where they were staying and gives her an assessment of Joe that literally floors her.

Just how far will Drogan to complete the job he was being paid to do? What is Nelda\u2019s real mission?As we hear the transcript from the doctor working with Beth and making sure that her memory is fogged and the facts remain twisted in her mind, what happens will definitely let you know that she is smart, not weak and will not allow him to overtake her again. What happens to Stella the nurse working with Pierce and what is Pierce\u2019s final fate? Just how many are killed in order to do Nelda\u2019s bidding? Will she pay the price?Betrayals, deceits, lies and cover ups all make up this outstanding novel as one woman\u2019s life hangs in the balance and one woman tries to manipulate to end result.

Then, the accident is revealed in the transcript, the truth about Rick and his follies in black and white and the end result about Beth\u2019s accident is finally revealed.

Eves Mom is the queen of secrets...qween! As expected with an IJ Eve Duncan novel Rhee is intrigue, shockers, love and friendship and some really cool friends that have neat abilities. I loved this story in general, as it has bits of action, suspense. Romance and more that should make it fun for all who read it, but I also appreciate the fact that this series has multiple strong women who work together to solve issues. Great series and enjoyable read."}, {"userName": "Evelyn", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20233174-evelyn", "userReview": "Sleep No More (Eve Duncan #15) by Iris Johansen.

Beth is on the run, and as her mind clears--detoxing from the drugs that have held her prisoner--she begins to see the threads of a twisted plot within the powerful Avery family, threatening to destroy Beth and anyone else who might jeopardize the high-stakes game that is already in play.", "title": "Sleep No More\n      \n          (Eve Duncan #15)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13538710-sleep-no-more", "average": 4.07, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1339076545l/13538710.jpg", "reviews": 367, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/32498.Iris_Johansen", "name": "Iris Johansen"}], "type": ["Mystery", "Suspense", "Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13538710-sleep-no-more", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15794861-sleep-no-more", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/78131.The_Killing_Game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/272264.The_Face_of_Deception", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/94299.The_Search", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/272279.Body_of_Lies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8702806-eve"]}
