That's because this is actually a group of 19 short stories, and they are similar in themes and subject matter, and they are sequential or chronological which gives it the feeling of a novel.It's about WWII in the Pacific. An ugly, horrific disaster taking place in paradise; talk about a contradiction. But it's historical fiction at a high level; you don't come away from a Michener book saying I didn't learn anything. And where most historical fiction writers lean heavily on the fiction and less on the history, Michener leans on the history.This book spawned a successful Broadway musical, South Pacific, and a feature film. It was also the basis for Michener's television series, Adventures in Paradise. If you are a Michener newbie I wouldn't start with this one. I always recommend Hawaii. I think it is his best novel, and if you are only going to read one, that should be the one.4 stars."}, {"userName": "Ensiform", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform", "userReview": "Easily more than the sum of its parts, this collection of stories is an eye-opening account of life in wartime: not the horrors of war (though there\u2019s a bit of that), but the waiting, the selfless heroism, the bottled-up passion, the thankless endless toil, the vast logistics of a campaign, the suddenness of death and loss and love. The omission of this work from the academic canon is utterly incomprehensible to me; it\u2019s everything that All Quiet on the Western Front is said to be, and more. Michener is far more than a captivating storyteller, collector of colorful characters, painter of vivid natural imagery, and chronicler of the orchestrations of world warfare. Each of the \"tales\" comprising his carefully-constructed epic narrative is at once thematically and stylistically related to the other smaller narratives and at the same time artistically whole in itself. While he does have poetic phrases at his command, what he can say without saying it \u2013 a subtly omitted word or a hint - is breathtaking.Michener impresses with his vast understanding of the scope of a military operation, as in the chapter \u201cAlligator\u201d (the codename for a fictitious invasion) \u2013 the planning, the estimated casualties, the men needed to build, the men needed simply to replace pencils and paper for plans, and on and on \u2013 and then he finishes with a few brief, poignant lines of a man who wrote to a plain woman \u2013 \u201cwho would never be married in a hundred years anyway\u201d \u2013 a proposal: \u201cYou was very sweet to me and I want to tell you if I\u2026\u201d \u201cBut he didn\u2019t. Some don\u2019t.\u201d But, Michener says, that letter plus the one from the chaplain was almost as good as being married. That talent of Michener\u2019s, the ability to juggle the big picture with the little human details, the forgotten grunts, the KIA and the faceless laborers, just blows me away. With every paragraph he weaves a new story of heroism, or efficiency, or defiance, or laziness, or lust, or bravery, or shame, and every character is all too human and believable. It makes the climax of the book, the landing at the island of Kuralei, all the more moving, as his narrator surveys the littered beaches and mourns the dead. This book is quite simply a brilliant masterpiece that should be read by every student of American history; it may be fiction, but it shows more plainly how this was the \u201cGreatest Generation\u201d without hagiography or needless embellishment. The did what they were asked to do, and worked and died and complained and loved, and they weren\u2019t saints or perfect soldiers. They were Americans, is all."}, {"userName": "Matthew Klobucher", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14494-matthew-klobucher", "userReview": "I think this book is a must-read for any American in the post-WWII era. Framed as a collection of loosely-connected short stories, narrated from a single perspectivce, Mitchner weaves together themes of love, loss, and struggle with a lucid and sometimes technical commentary on the American war effort in the Pacific theater. His characters are both intensely human and larger than life, and the developing theme throughout the book is that titanic and often tragic effors contribute to the betterment of individual people (and to our society as a whole). This is the oldest story in our collective history: anecdotes and tales of adventure, set against an exotic background, grounded in our own perspective. The \"Tales\" are above all inspiring--and stand apart from any American literature written since the inception of our nation."}, {"userName": "Taija", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45297035-taija", "userReview": "1948 Pulitzer Prize Winner.I read this book for my Pulitzer Prize Reading Challenge. I'm probably already prejudiced when reading any PP winner, but I really tried to remain neutral while reading this book. With the amount of WWII literature I have been reading, I'm finding myself wondering if I am in fact a Pacifist - or at least against war. Because I'm NOT against someone physically defending themselves. This book was heart wrenching. So many men died. So many men committed adultery on their wives. I HATE adultery. I don't know if anyone can remain integral in war. The more I read of people in the trenches, and the effects of war (PTSD, dead fathers, mothers, brothers, lovers, family) the more I believe war is awful. I respect those who fought and died for their country, but then I'm torn when I read accounts of those men willing to lay down their lives for those they left behind, but are having multiple affairs with woman while abroad. This book tugged on so many of my heart strings. Men fell in love with island woman but refused to marry them because they were coloured (yellow, black, mixed). I wasn't used to reading a book where most of the racism was thrown against other races (like the \"yellows\" or the \"Japs\") and I wasn't as affected by the racial terms. however, as soon as I read about a coloured person being called a \"nigger,\" I would flare up. Interesting how racism affects us more when it's thrown at your race. I was going to give this book a 4 star because of the amount of affairs, but the last chapters did me in for a 5 star. Michener wrote so so so so well. I'm really glad I knew that this book was a collection of short stories- literally \"tales of the South Pacific,\" various accounts of men who fought in different locations. I may have gotten confused and quit reading because the story line didn't flow smoothly. My favourite chapters were 'Mutiny,' 'Our Heroine,' and 'Fo Dolla.'Highly recommend this book!"}, {"userName": "Deanne", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/370475-deanne", "userReview": "Not at all like South Pacific, no body talking happy talk, no women warbling about washing men out of their hair.

He was a favorite of my grandfather's. I get the sense that his narrative voice may have been similar to the voice in my grandfather's head- the same matter-of-fact, US white male dominated world-view that pre-dated the 70's. Yet, still sensitive to all people and empathetic to the human condition. It was interesting to read this just after Guard of Honor- same war, same time period- 2 very different waiting games but with similar relationship tensions among genders, classes, ranks and ethnic groups.

I took awhile to get through it (but that could be just me - I don't particularly feel the need to rush through books like this... only taking it in a bit at a time) but I found it quite engaging on the whole. I found out that it inspired a Rodgers & Hammerstein film of the same name - and after that I could not but read the book in that narrator voice that usually comes from films of that era so that the whole reading experience became somewhat documentary-like in parts. \"Before me lay the dead, the heroic dead who took the island. Upon a strange plateau, on a strange island, in a strange sea, far from their farms and villages, they slept forever beside the lagoon which bore them to their day of battle. Over them the sea birds dipped in endless homage. Above them the deep blue sky erected a cathedral. I cannot put into words the emotions that capture me as I looked on the graves of my friends. Never once during the five weeks I helped to plan the operations... did I believe that I would die. No more did any man who now lay still in death. The Marine in the prow of the ship, he might die. The SeaBee who made noises when he ate, he might topple from the crane. But not I!... If you sit at home and read that two hundred and eighty-one men die in taking an island, the number is only a symbol for the mind to classify. But when you stand at the white crosses, the two hundred and eighty one dead became men: the sons, the husbands, and the lovers.\""}, {"userName": "Kenny", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1260706-kenny", "userReview": "Howard Winant points to the questioning of unchallenged American values\u2014\u201cwas the United States really \u2018the land of the free, and the home of the brave\u2019? (148)\u2014as the \u201cend of innocence,\u201d led by the black civil rights movement and sympathizers. In his use of the facetious, dramatized, bigoted caricature of a young Midwestern nurse, Nellie Forbush, Michener addresses the end of innocence by calling attention to Nurse Forbush\u2019s ignorant racism through her own absurd, erratic behavior. Specifically, the momentary suspension of her infatuation towards De Becque upon seeing his dark-skinned daughters casts her in an irrational, brutish light. Michener\u2019s description of Nellie\u2019s violent emotional and physical aversion to children suggests that he himself disapproves of such behavior, and was generally reproving such ignorance as could be found at that time in the United States, particularly in the more rural areas, seen in Nellie\u2019s own background: \u201cHer entire Arkansas upbringing made it impossible for her to deny the teachings of her youth\u201d (138). We can understand the negative connotations attributed to Nellie\u2019s character especially in the juxtaposition of her rant\u2014\u201cEmile De Becque had lived with the nigger. He had nigger children. If she married him, they would be her step-daughters\u201d (138)\u2014and the repeated use (or variation on) the word \u201cchildren.\u201d Such hatred, as read in Nellie\u2019s \u201crevulsion,\u201d seems incongruent and simply wrong when directed towards children, a point which Michener emphasizes by lumping such loathing with more innocent vocabulary (too, \u201cstep-daughters\u201d). Furthermore, after her tantrum, Nellie becomes even more of a ridiculous character in Michener\u2019s own description, behaving like a child (\u201c\u2018No!\u2019 Nellie cried in real anguish, stamping her foot. \u2018It isn\u2019t that! It\u2019s something you don\u2019t know.\u2019\u201d (139)) and taking actions that, out of context of the rest of the narrative, might otherwise illustrate a truly insane person. Her extreme swings of emotion\u2014between recoiling from De Becque and the children for his involvement with their dark-skinned mothers, and sudden, feverish desire for the adventure that living on an island and entering into such an exotic family suggest\u2014discredit her character, and advocate for a reading that holds at least some intentional degree of irony on Michener\u2019s part. In this way, by creating a truly ridiculous, non-commendable character who\u2019s defining trait at the end of the narrative is her deplorable racism (towards children), the author himself challenges the same as-yet-unquestioned values of American life that the \u201cend of innocence\u201d confronts, and suggests that racial discrimination not be left unopposed, but, rooted in ignorance, should be corrected by education and the entry into a new post-war era of equality."}, {"userName": "Andrew Kraemer", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5671196-andrew-kraemer", "userReview": "I must say that I really did not enjoy reading this book. It is incredibly slow, is shows a very distorted fairy-taleesque picture of the Pacific theater, and many of the problems in the story, in my opinion, are incredibly mundane. However, despite disliking the book I respect the role of Tales of the South Pacific in American literary history. Here's why: When this book was released in 1947, it was the book America needed, not the book that best showed life in the Pacific. The American public had been through so much during WWII that they would not be interested in a Saving Private Ryan novel equivalent, like Helmet for My Pillow. As a result, we get Tales of the South Pacific. A mundane book about mundane events, except for the second to last story.

Written in 1946 and published a year later, it must have been one of the first epics on the Second World War, and one that focused entirely on the Pacific theatre would catch the eye of the jury even easier. Although widely fictional - as always with Michener - the excellent short stories and tales take the reader along some of the U.S. Navy operations between 1942 and '44, focusing on the Solomon and Russell islands, as well as a major fictional operation against the Japanese empire on Kuralei island. The author served in the Pacific himself, making this 360-page novel extremely vivid, accountable and worth reading to this day.

It lay there, a huge shadow,a daily reminder, and suddenly past and present clashed together.It was only in later years that I realised that WE hadn't finished discussing that war either. Obsessed is not the word ...perhaps it is Grief and Loss and Horror.THAT was the obsession.A few days later two of the young children, out fishing from a canoe,had hooked a shark which began dragging them down that channel and out to the open sea, beyond the reef.Laughingly they retold how they had found a knife and cut the line.Their white teeth flashed as they giggled.No drama. This was their backyard. But I had been told how the landing marines,terrified of sharks - it wasn't their backyard -had been given a shark-repellant to throw in the water when they were wading in. It didn't work , of course,but it got them out of their landing craft, with faith intact. People who see the musical \"South Pacific\" as a soft alternative may have forgotten that summoning up deep racism in plot and songhad only received similar exposure in \"Showboat\".To place this in the musical was to be true to Michener's bookand to sing about it , sheer defiance.And racism is still far from dead in America,It is only in the 18th chapter (there are 19 altogether ),that we actually have a Big Battlewith \"The Landing on Kuralei\".It explodes in useless and unavoidable slaughter,mainly of young men we have just gotten to know in some detail - they are blown apart before the fighting has even gotten underway.And one of the best and most humane of leaders is killed by a suicide Japanese soldier.He is replaced by a thorough racist, a man not worthy of any command and in the final chapter we meet two niggers, as he calls them,who are being punished by him by having to guard the cemetery.\"A Cemetery At Hoga Point\" reunites us with the men just wiped outin the previous chapterFor 'the niggers' it is an honour and a place of reverence and fellowship because here lie their mates,both black and white.They tend their graves and flower themThis last time I read Michener's book , I was still being surprised by the Process of Rereading.I'd first read this book at 12 years of age...now I was in my early 60's.But this was the first timewhen reading this last chapterI wept uncontrollably.But I knew the book was exactly the same,the book I'd read at twelve,and a few times after.So what had changed ???"}, {"userName": "GymGuy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5850785-gymguy", "userReview": "I will agree with other reviewers that this is a must read for anyone interested in WWII history. I've read reviews where they thought this was a white-wash. First, remember that this won the Pulitzer Prize for literature in 1948. While a great part of Michener's novel is light-hearted, one should take into account that it was published in 1947, just 2 years after the end of the War. Like our military is reluctant to discuss the horrors of the Middle East wars, I'm sure Michener, being a veteran who had served as a Lt. Commander in the Pacific Theater, wanted to write something that was not just a rehash of the horrors he had just witnessed.That being said, \"Tales\" is a loosely written chain of stories connected by common characters, time and place. If you are thinking this is going to be just the book version of the Broadway musical, it is not. The musical covers only about 3 of the stores: those concerning Nelly Forbush, Lt. Cable, Blood Mary and Luther Billis. The rest of the 15 or so stories deal with other richly developed characters that are just as compelling as these. Rogers and Hammerstein simply picked four out of many.\"Tales\" is a rich feast of well-developed characters, stunning descriptions of beautiful coral lagoons and heart-felt stories of life, love, humor, death, heroism and the injustices of mortality. Much of the story is told through characters who are in land-based operations. Only at the end do we actually see an extended battle. The final chapter is a heart-wrenching realization of death and loss. With some characters we learn their fate. Others, as in life, are simply forgotten."}, {"userName": "Owen", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19377087-owen", "userReview": "James A. Michener, like so many aspiring novelists, did not find success until he was nearly forty. But when he did find it with Tales of South Pacific, his first published novel, he seemed to have started at the zenith of his career, winning the Pulitzer in 1948, and having Roger and Hammerstein adapt his work for a Broadway musical in 1949. The motion picture South Pacific topped the box office in 1958 and its soundtrack, with such well known favorites as \u201cBali-Ha\u2019i,\u201d \u201cSome Enchanted Evening,\u201d and \u201cThere\u2019s Nothing Like a Dame,\u201d spent 115 weeks at number one on the UK album chart, longer than any other album. Michener would go on to crank out forty more titles after his Pulitzer-Prize performance, and while subsequent works seemed to rely on the same strengths that made South Pacific so remarkable, none of them quite succeeded in recreating the original magic. As with all great successes, Michener\u2019s came when opportunity converged with preparation. He graduated summa cum laude with a degree in English and history from Swathmore College, taught at various schools, including Harvard, and edited textbooks for a New York publishing firm until he was called to active duty in the United States Naval Reserves. During World War II, he was stationed in the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific, where he served as a naval historian. The notes that he gathered at this unique time in American history would later serve as the fodder for Tales of the South Pacific. The book is really a collection of loosely connected short stories that are told in chronological order. In all there are nineteen tales, most of them narrated in the first person by various military personnel who seem, on the first reading, indistinct variations of the same navel officer, or of Michener himself. Indeed, to focus on the narrator in any one story requires us to divert our attention from the action, which readily pulls us in with rich personalities, exotic locations, and conflicts endemic to U.S. military life during World War II. The introduction opens by attempting to \u201ctell [us] about the South Pacific. The way it actually was.\u201d And with this sentence we have Michener\u2019s greatest strength in this work, his ability to tell Joe Public how it really was to be deployed to a tropical island on the other end of the world, and to fight an enemy as faceless and powerful as God himself. When attempting to describe the South Pacific, the opening narrator claims he is unable to do so because to because \u201cthe people intervene\u201d\u2014or rather, digressions about the people he met such as \u201can old Tonkinese woman who used to sell human heads;\u201d the \u201cRemittance Man,\u201d who lived among the \u201cJaps\u201d and broadcasted \u201cradio news of their movement\u201d until the day he died; the \u201cmad commander\u201d who, at two o\u2019clock in the morning, summoned a carpenter to sand out a spot in his floor; and an \u201cugly old\u201d admiral who, while flying above the islands, raised a tentative finger and pointed, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019ll build our base.\u201d There were also the men of \u201clesser ranks,\u201d like Tony Fry, who painted twelve beer bottles on his plane, one for each mission in which he ferried alcohol, or Luther Billis, who, despite being enlisted, went as shirtless as a native, with bracelets and tattoos to boot. By the end of the chapter, the reader sees all too clearly what Tales of the South Pacific is about: one digression after the next, one memorable person after the other. The longest digression of the book, and perhaps the most well known, is the chapter entitled \u201cFo\u2019 Dolla\u2019,\u201d which recounts the love affair between First Lieutenant Joe Cable and the seventeen-year-old Tonkinese girl, Liat, on the island of Bali-Ha\u2019i. Here, the matchmaker is Liat\u2019s mother, who is known to the Marines and sailors alike as \u201cBloody Mary.\u201d Michener describes Mary as a small, sprite, sloppily dressed, fifty-five \u2013year old woman with very few teeth, all of which are \u201cfunereally black.\u201d She also has \u201cravines running out of the corners of her mouth, about four on each side\u201d, and they are \u201cusually filled with betal juice,\u201d making her look like her mouth has been \u201cgashed by a rusty razor.\u201d She\u2019s acquired a very limited, yet effective vocabulary that the Marines taught her. Michener describes: The words Mary learned were hardly ones she could have used, say as a salesgirl in Macy\u2019s or Jordan Marsh. For example, if a sailor just off a boat asked her the price of a grass skirt, she would smile sweetly and say, \u201cFo\u2019 dolla\u2019.\u201d\t \u201c\u2019At\u2019s too much for a grass skirt, baby.\u201d\tThen Mary would scream at him, thrusting her nose into his face, \u201cBullshit, brother!\u201d She wasn\u2019t quite sure what the words meant, but from the way new men would jump back in astonishment as if they had been hit with a board, she knew it was effective.Other phrases in Mary\u2019s arsenal are: \u201cSoandso you, major!,\u201d \u201cLieutenant one bullshit goddamn fool!,\u201d \u201cGoddam snovabeech no!!,\u201d \u201cYou big stuff!!\u201d \u201cGoddamn stinker!,\u201d and my favorite, \u201cSoandso bastard!\u201d Due to Bloody Mary\u2019s authenticity, we instantly suspect that Michener himself met a woman in the likeness of her. His portrayal of Joe Cable, however, is full of a lackluster familiarity, as if Michener is waking up only to see himself in the bathroom, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s only you.\u201d Even though \u201cFo\u2019 Dolla\u2019\u201d is conveyed in the third person, Cable seems to be little more than the lens through which we experience the South Pacific, not one of the amazing people who \u201cintervenes\u201d through digression. Lieutenant Tony Fry, however, is as colorful as they come and perhaps one of the most ubiquitous characters throughout the collection, appearing in five of the tales: \u201cMutiny,\u201d \u201cThe Cave,\u201d \u201cA Boar\u2019s Tooth,\u201d \u201cWine for the Mess in Segi,\u201d and \u201cThose who Fraternize.\u201d Fry, first described as a \u201ctall, thin, somewhat stooped\u201d Naval officer with a \u201ctwinkle in his eye and a merry manner,\u201d sort of explodes on the scene by sabotaging a bull dozer with a stick of dynamite. The dozer would have been used to knock down a \u201ccathedral\u201d of pine trees to build an air strip on the island of Norfolk. The island locals, who are descendents of a penal colony and of the infamous mutineers who rebelled against Captain Bligh on the HMS Bounty in 1789, are opposed to the airstrip.  \u201cFry,\u201d I said. \u201cYou could be court-martialed for this.\u201d Tony turned to face me. \u201cWho would believe you?\u201d he asked. \u201cBy God, man,\u201d I said grimly. \u201cIf I had the facts I\u2019d press this case.\u201d \u201cWith whom?\u201d he asked. \u201cWith Ghormley? With Admiral Kester? \u201cYou tell your story. I\u2019ll tell mine.\u201dFry\u2019s witty and rebellious nature is showcased in other stories, too, most notably in \u201cThe Cave,\u201d where it\u2019s contrasted with his superior, Lieutenant Commander Charlesworth, a graduate of the Naval Academy at Annapolis, and perhaps the very embodiment of the navy itself. This Fry was beyond description, a completely new type of naval officer. He didn\u2019t give a damn for anything or anybody. He was about thirty, unmarried. He had some money and although he loved the Navy and its fuddy ways, he ridiculed everything and everybody. He was completely oblivious to rank. Even admirals loved him for it.

I\u2019ve been told the Army wouldn\u2019t tolerate Fry a week.Tony Fry becomes obsessed with the \u201cRemittance Man,\u201d a British intelligence figure hidden somewhere in enemy territory, broadcasting news of Japanese naval movements.

The flying weather, he claims, is excellent:In fact, flying looks so well that you should probably have visitors. Very heavy concentrations of bombers overhead at 1100 this morning. I can judge aircraft, not less than ninety bombers and fighters are getting ready for a strike this morning. Some are in the air ready to leave. They appear to be at 12,000 feet. Don\u2019t bet on that, though. I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve learned to use the estimating devices too well yet. Let\u2019s say not less than 10,000. Some fighters have moved in from Bougainville. Look at them! Rolling about, doing loops and all sorts of crazy things. There they go! It\u2019s quite a circus. This will be a fine day. Cheerio, Americans! Good hunting!Then the radio clicks and there is silence.If Michener is innovative at all, it is in his ability to capture the essence of people with dialog and a few, well-placed, esoteric details. He wins the Pultizer not because he is a literary stylist, or even a good writer, but because he a good story-teller, one who is uniquely positioned to accurately portray the zeigeist of World War II in the South Pacific, and the experiences, if not sacrifices, in Tom Browkaw\u2019s words, of America\u2019s \u201cgreatest generation.\u201d In a few stories of the collection such as \u201cDry Rot\u201d and \u201cA Boar\u2019s Tooth,\u201d Michener digresses even more, elaborating on skin diseases and local religious customs. In still others, which are my personal favorites, he broadens his camera, and takes us along for suspenseful military sequences: \u201cCoral Sea,\u201d \u201cThe Airstrip at Konora,\u201d \u201cThe Strike,\u201d and \u201cThe Landing on Kuralie.\u201d These military sequences have the effect of framing the more intimate, character-driven anecdotes, giving them the context and perspective that we would otherwise lack. In all, though, we are compelled to read simply because of the subject matter, because of Michener\u2019s command of detail, his ability to distil the essence of people, places, and events, and tell us, digression or no digression, what the South Pacific was really like."}, {"userName": "Tom", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22225973-tom", "userReview": "Michener has written a deeply moving series of stories set in the South Pacific during the height of world war 2.

Also, gone from the musical are much of the sexism and the racial bigotry that is presented in Michener's stories (okay, clearly the Lt Cable-Liat love story presents the love&marriage-limiting aspect of US racial attitudes, but the book covers a wider range of WWII era US racial discrimination than just the sexual). I guess one should expect the musical to be a somewhat expurgated version of the original work. But it's the difference between a chorus of guys in seaman's duds singing \"we ain't got dames\" and stories in which military men try to rape female nurses. Also less explicit in the musical, perhaps by the nature of the format - they are singing and dancing through their days, aren't they? - but well portrayed in these stories, is the daily struggle our soldiers had just dealing with the shear boredom of their mainly humdrum, sometimes make-work, daily lives while waiting and contemplating the unknown of coming battles, juxtaposed with the antithetical deadly and arbitrary mayhem of actual combat. Front line assault soldiers knew the probabilities of dying, and they very often did, but when a small group of brave soldiers charge attacking Japanese and they paradoxically become common victims with their enemies of Allied artillery fire, the reader is struck by the arbitrary nature of death in war. Even support staff that might assume some measure of safety could be seemingly arbitrary victims - Seabees killed by Japanese snipers while preparing an airplane runway. And why is a good and generous Commander killed by a Japanese soldier's suicide grenade attack at the opening of an airstrip, then succeeded in command by a bigoted jerk, while a bloviated Commander who talks large about his desire for combat is able to get sent back to Texas and safety before the big assault? Which is all to say that while the musical South Pacific is a fun production - who doesn't know the lines to several of the songs? - the book has a lot more meat to it.The juxtapostion of the daily tedium and boredom in a seeming paradise with warfare and the paradox and arbitrariness of death is nicely pulled together in the final story, A Cemetery at Hoga Point."}, {"userName": "Carl", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5632471-carl", "userReview": "This book, which was the first winner of the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1948, is a collection of little stories about World War II in the South Pacific. James Michener was in the U.S. Navy, and traveled widely through the area, giving him a unique view of various places, people, and events, and these must have been quite fresh in his mind when he wrote the book.The musical South Pacific was based upon the book. While I read the book some of the music began going through my head, particularly the song about Bloody Mary. But the musical only used a sliver of the tales, that were quite varied.One story was set in the black days of 1942 \u2013 New Zealanders preparing for a likely invasion by the Japanese, who would certainly treat them like they treated the Chinese. Some tales are about battles, one tale is about skin rashes, another story is about a supply depot, another about the natural beauty of the islands. A few tales are about romances. Reading these would make you wonder how the Americans ever had time to fight the Japanese. The musical was based on two of these romantic tales, but the musical does not follow the book exactly. Lt. Joe Cable has a darker fate in the book.Altogether, the disparate tales bring these almost forgotten days to life. The book begins with the sentence \u201cI wish I could tell you about the South Pacific.\u201d Well, I think that Michener did a good job of telling about the South Pacific."}, {"userName": "Gale", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17664194-gale", "userReview": "PASSION AND PENANCE IN PARADISE  Mitchener\u2019s World War 2 collection of short stories remains as vibrant and compelling in terms of human interest today as when it was written. Alternating between the logistics of war with personal suffering and joy, these stories present the reader with a composite of life and death in tropical paradise. Characters popularized in the Broadway musical, South Pacific, appear in several stories in this fascinating patchwork of passion and pathos. As all emotions prove more poignant in a backdrop of war, the inner conflicts of personal desire and frustration touched responsive chords in both post war and contemporary readers.  Mitchener\u2019s themes include frequent references to racial prejudice which were rampant in the United States. As well as the devastating effect of prolonged heat and limited space in Westerners. Throughout the book runs the thread of the Allies\u2019 gradual reclamation of the Japanese-held islands, culminating in the strike on Kuralei, with its the shocking toll of life. As the ubiquitous narrator pays a respectful visit to the new cemetery, this collection draws to a gentle close, yet Mitchener\u2019s unforgettable characters live on in our imagination.

A little too much romance in it for me, but maybe that's what his editor thought would be needed to sell the book. Otherwise it would only have been a bunch of stories about Sailors and Marines going nuts from boredom while waiting for another invasion to kick off. All in all, probably the most honest piece of fiction I've read from the 1940's.EDIT (2014): I wrote the above review before reading \"From Here to Eternity\".

He hadn\u2019t written before, but the intense exposure to the pressures of war and Michener\u2019s curiosity about human character under such pressure inspired him to stay up nights on end telling stories. Michener tells the stories of Americans of all military ranks from varied backgrounds and their interactions with each other, island natives, and island colonials. These tales are told in first person, and are loosely based upon his wartime experiences.The book is written as a series of short stories with various characters reappearing throughout the book. Written in 1946, the book starts out with the building of a runway on a fictional island and ends with the aftermath of storming of a beach on another fictional island. In between, there are the (not cleaned up) stories from South Pacific, the famous musical adaptation, stories that were too risqu\u00e9 for screen adaptation in 1949, and other that reveal that the character of a man has nothing to do with his military rank. The stories are told with humor and humanity.It\u2019s easy to see why this book won critical acclaim and the hearts of readers in the post WWII era. I recommend it for anyone who is new to Michener\u2019s books because it\u2019s a simpler saga than many.

Somewhere in the second half of the book I realized that this should NOT be taken as a collection of stories, but rather as a wholesome novel with weirdly ordered chapters. This helped as I didn't feel compelled to abandon characters only to meet them later in other stories. If you start reading the book with the idea that all of its bits and pieces will align and push you forward, it becomes less of a waste of time.

The tales are told by a young naval officer whose duties on an admiral's staff take him up and down the islands. He meets many people, both service men and the original inhabitants, and hears their stories - the remittance man who lived among the Japanese and, radioed their movements until one fatal and dramatic morning; Bloody Mary, the Tonkinese woman who introduced her daughter to a young Marine lieutenant; Emile de Becque, the French planter who fell in love with an American nurse; Tony Fry, the individualist who fought a very personal war in his own very effective way; Lieutenant Bill Harbison, who lived like a hero but turned out to be a louse; and the young enlisted man from Ohio who was going to pieces on one of the islands until a Sea Bee gave him a reason for living. Because Mr. Michener was there, he is able to reproduce exactly the mood and atmosphere of the early critical days of the Pacific War. Because, in addition, he has a lively imagination and inventive power, he has turned this raw material into stories that will be eagerly read for their dramatization of the greatest adventure of our generation.", "title": "Tales of the South Pacific", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12483777-tales-of-the-south-pacific", "average": 4.04, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348952684l/12483777.jpg", "reviews": 342, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7995.James_A_Michener", "name": "James A.
