In public, he treated Hollis as though he were a servant; at home he made certain the boy knew he was an outcast. Often, Alan would sneak into Hollis\u2019 room, where he\u2019d do as much damage as possible. He poured calves\u2019 blood into Hollis\u2019s bureau drawers, ruining Hollis\u2019s limited wardrobe, knowing full well Hollis would rather wear the same clothes every day than admit defeat. He left a pile of cow manure in the closet, and by the time Hollis figured out where the stench was coming from, everything Henry Murray had given him, the books and the lamps and the blankets, had been contaminated by the smell. and then, later, alan and his similarly-aged pals beat hollis up, and tie him to a tree in the snowy middle of winter, leaving him there for hours until march finds him and frees him. a gaggle of adult men beating up a 13-year-old boy because one of 'em's jelly that his daddy kidnapped a runaway and loves him more. usual wh bits follow - march and hollis hit it off, go wilding together, spy on the wealthy neighbors, have more explicit intercourse than is mentioned in wuthering heights, daddy kiddiestealer dies, alan kicks hollis up to the attic, starts charging him backrent and such, hollis leaves for three years, but before he returns, fortune made, ready to take his revenge on everyone, march marries fancy next-door-neighbor richard and moves to california, where she has a daughter named gwen, and they all stay put there for nineteen years. which is different from how wh plays out.why is this important? because march does not return home during all that time, even though many of the other events of wh do repeat here; events that would cause a normal person to buy a plane ticket: hollis marries richard's sister, they have a kid, wife and kid both die. alan has a wife and a kid, wife dies, hollis takes kid and raises him as ward (in a much less evil way than heathcliff raised hareton). and none of those deaths or \"nephew being raised by former lover/adopted brother\" cause march to come home. but when this book's nelly dean dies, off goes march, leaving richard at home, but taking their teenage daughter in tow, to settle her affairs and oopsie-whoopsie - resume her affair with hollis. who has naturally been waiting for her all this time, but has also bedded all the local ladies because he's dreamy and rich and a man has needs. march is in no way a catherine. she's got no spark, no cruelty, not enough to withstand hollis' douchiness. after some pretty unconvincing resistance, march goes full-bore back into hollis\u2019 arms, with no sense of discretion - in full view of the gossipy townsfolk, her rivals for hollis\u2019 backseat affections, and her fifteen-year-old daughter, who's trying to deflect he father's frequent calls and even when he finds out, he's way more chill about it than he ought to be.the hollis/march thang very quickly turns from \u201call-consuming greedy passion\u201d to \u201csuper controlling and abusive,\u201d and march becomes this sleepwalker, drifting through town in clothes from the goodwill, pale and scrawny and neglecting her self-care and her daughter, who finds her own distraction with hollis' adopted son hank, which you will recall is alan's son, so her own first cousin. which relationship march is fully aware but recklessly uncaring of taboo as she loses more and more of herself to increasingly violent intercourse and jealous rages from hollis, who's still sleeping with other women. none of this is anything like the dynamic in withering heights, and it's all very tedious. so much is glossed over - march and gwen were supposed to be there for two weeks and then suddenly months have passed and gwen is enrolled in school there and how much did they even pack for this? and gwen and hank are totally overwhelmed by the situation. less so the \"we're cousins\" part, more just the march-and-hollis boning part. sure, hollis is a jerk and march is letting herself go to seed and everything's a mess, but they seem to be taking on all the melodrama that really should be more evenly distributed throughout the rest of the story. They sit in silence, at two in the morning, as if they were an old married couple, drinking coffee and holding hands. They\u2019re trapped by circumstance. They can feel their situation chipping away at what they might have had.that seems more tragic than it needs to be.On this night...they don't talk about how their future is unraveling; they don't think about all they have to lose. They go into that small bedroom off the kitchen and curl up together on the single bed, on top of the woolen blanket, arms entwined. If she could, Gwen would whisper that she loved him. If he could, he would vow that everything would turn out right. But that's not the way things are now, and they both know it. That's not the way things are at all.i mean, really. be normal teenagers and don't let your parents' affair get in the way of your own intercourse. i dunno - i had a lot of problems with this one. the hollis/march connection didn't seem strongly developed enough in their youth to set in motion this whole cannonball, it changed the whole point of wuthering heights to have it be some lifetime movie version about a woman too consumed by her love of a man who smells like sulphur (i mean, really...) to acknowledge her own abuse - this is not my wuthering heights. i knew i should have read Ruby"}, {"userName": "Janice", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32653-janice", "userReview": "I'm technically not even done reading this book yet and I'm seething with hate for it.

The Entertainment Weekly summarized the story as: \"Her books unfold artfully without feeling fussed over or writing-workshopped to death ... [In] Here on Earth, she plumbs the interior lives of, among others, a drunken recluse, a heartsick teenage boy, an angry daughter, a near madman, a cuckolded husband, and three wounded women, with such modesty and skill that she seems to witness rather than invent their lives.\u201dSadly, the book did not explore the characters of the men in pain enough. But there was a gentle approach to these men who just could not let go of their hurt and had to deal with sorrow in their own lonely ways.The story was riveting, gripping, and beautifully written. The prose was outstanding.Jenkintown, near Olive Tree Lake in Massachusetts, had its collection of characters. Some lovable and others not; some were devils and others angels, or so the inhabitants believed. There were the illusive foxes roaming the woods, after most of them were eliminated since the hunting prohibition was lifted, only to leave an uncontrollable population of rabbits behind. But the foxes were there, lurking and waiting. Even the firefighters were relieved when there were no fires on the hill. Some localities were accompanied by just too much bad luck. When March Murray, and her teenage daughter Gwen, after nineteen years, returned from California to Fox Hill Farm, to attend the funeral of an old family friend, Judith Dale, more than just a grave were dug in the cold October weather. The past was also demanding a few determined diggers to expose the skeletons of long ago and how it influenced the hearts and minds of the current population in town. Love sometimes had to be renamed. Love could be set aside too. It did not always carry the sweet smell of the roses from Annabeth Cooper's garden. Nor did it reflect in memories of the siblings, Richard and Belinda's future. The foxes were lurking...waiting. And sometimes there simply was no time for crying. Life was always interfering.The day when Hollis saw the Unity, Peace and Double Delight roses bunched together in March's hand, he blamed a stupid dog, a stonewall and a rose garden for everything he lost. That was years ago. Many years later the townsfolk believed that the black snow was a sign of the devil coming to collect his due. But Forgiveness and Understanding forever brought the foxes back into the woods where they belonged. The was new hope that the rabbits will finally be brought under control.This is my first encounter with this author's work and it really convinced me to explore more of her beautiful writing."}, {"userName": "Zoe B", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/398596-zoe-b", "userReview": "Loved, loved, loved, LOVED it!!!! Ok so if this book was food, it would be a hot fudge brownie with caramel sauce - really, really good, at first comforting, but then it makes you kind of sick. Now this isn't a book for everyone, not everyone can stomach so much passion and long lost love. I, on the other hand, could ingest this stuff until the cows come home - and no sweet has ever been too much for me (cotton candy - bring it on! Candy apples - bring em on!).I was immediately whisked away and transported by this book - devouring the pages in three days - which is quite a feat with a 15 month old, let me tell you. It is about long lost love and passion, but it's also about parent-child relationships, the role of parent as exemplar for our children and the expectations we have of our parents. It also wrestles with the classic theme of shades of gray, no one being only evil or only good. I hope you are as enraptured by this book as I was. If not, put it on your pancakes and call it a day."}, {"userName": "Joe Mossa", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/193186-joe-mossa", "userReview": "i may have become a snob after reading so many important books in the past three years,but this writing is terrible. if i were to count the cliches hoffman uses ,i wouldn t be able to follow the narrative. after i read that she was imitating WURTHERING HEIGHTS, i decided i had a duty to finish the book which i had thrown down in disgust after reading page 213. read my other posts to see what happened there. charles dickens got away with melodrama so i guess we can excuse a contemporary writer for doing the same. i have a copy of her LOCAL GIRLS which i may read cause i feel i should read books i own. i confess that when i bought both of her books,i thought i was buying an alice walker book. i have trouble with concentration..lol. i read her TURTLE MOON years before i became a reading snob and remember little about it except i think it moved me abit. what to read next ? i am away from my library and may have to read my son s college lit book to pass our remaining time here i come..w.b. yeats,t.s. eliot, ..happy reading,joe."}, {"userName": "Bodosika Bodosika", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5553160-bodosika-bodosika", "userReview": "Alice Hoffman weaves an interesting tale,though my first book by the author and though I rated it 3stars,I will like to read another of her novel."}, {"userName": "Oana", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16981538-oana", "userReview": "Imagine \"Wuthering Hights\" written by someone waaaaay less talented than Ms. Bronte.

Hoffman spent so much time trying to align the plot to \"Wuthering Heights\" that she forgot to be original and make the story her own. The result is a perversion of Emily Bronte's tale that completely misses the point. [return][return]March travels back to her hometown with her teen daughter Gwen for the funeral of her Nelly Dean-esque housekeeper. There, she meets up with Hollis, her childhood love that got away. The renew their love, but Hollis is bent on revenge and abuses her physically, emotionally, and sexually. Meanwhile Gwen finds romance with her Hareton, and all find themselves caught in Hollis' sick trap. There is no redemption for any of the characters; the survivors are only lucky to have escaped -- a denouement with the character development worthy of a Vincent Price film.[return][return]Hoffman just doesn't get it- what makes the reader fall for Heathcliff despite his tyrannical ways is his undying passion for Catherine. He can abuse Isabella and trap young Catherine Linton into a loveless marriage, but the sheer force of his passion for his Catherine blows it all away. Hollis has no such passion for March. He is only fueled on revenge. Besides the physical abuse, Hollis cheats on March once he has her, completely disregarding any notion that he may actually love or feel passion for her. Hoffman seems to have confused passion with rape. Their romantic scenes read like the worse bodice ripper. To complete the characterization of Hollis, Hoffman should have given him a long Snidely Whiplash mustache to twirl.[return] [return]Instead of spending so much time trying to get the characters to fit their \"Wuthering Heights\" mold so closely, Hoffman should have instead used the novel as a guide for exploring the relationships in her story. A more talented author could have made the distinction between healthy love and obsessive love without playing a game of \"How perverted can I make this guy?\" In fact, a more talented author did, and Hoffman was way over her head meddling with Bronte. As is, her treatment of March, and March's acceptance of it, is downright misogynistic and Hoffman should have known better, as should have Oprah."}, {"userName": "Judy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1328950-judy", "userReview": "This is a dark romance.

Never in my life have I loathed a book so much. We are reading this book for my book club this month, and from the start I was skeptical. You know I love Oprah, but one thing I know for sure is that we do not have the same taste in books. Oprah picked this book as her book club pick back in 1998 and I honestly don't know what she was thinking. The book itself is written beautifully - I mean thank goodness - because the characters and the story is just so damn depressing I don't know if I could have made it through. Its about a woman and her daughter who return to the mother's hometown to attend a funeral. The mother rekindles her love with a old flame, Hollis, who is hands down the worst character I have ever read in a book ever. I know the book has beautiful metaphors- and surely it will provide a great deal of discussion during book club- but I finished the book this morning and I still can't shake the feeling it left me in: totally and utterly depressed.

Now that might just be a generality, but after a few hits and misses, I've really enjoyed her last three books and this one, much like \"The Ice Queen,\" was really fantastic. March returns to her hometown to mourn the death of a woman she and many others held dear. But she also returns to a world in which, as a young girl, she was immersed into a love so deep that she's never been able to get over it. When the boy she'd loved so deeply never returned for her, she'd married another and moved on, her baby girl the one thing holding her back from going back to him for so many years. Now, the boy is now a man and he's been waiting for her. Finding the pieces of the affair they'd left behind, they begin again, a relationship so deep and intense that March finds herself detached from the real world, so much so that she doesn't see how others, including her daughter, fear for her safety and of their belief that he was indeed the reason for his ex wife's death. As March becomes pulled further away from herself, her daughter Gwen, a troubled child, finds solace in a horse and a love in the boy she never knew as her first cousin. There are several storylines going on in this book and they entwine easily and beautifully. Hoffman very talentedly makes you both hate and empathize with most of the characters, and she never truly distinguishes a \"hero\" or a \"villain.\" A great read overall!"}, {"userName": "Alayna", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7760-alayna", "userReview": "Parts of this book were very good - it sort of wraps you into this small town, nostalgic way of life, that I really appreciated. It was good to read now, at the end of October/November as things get cold, since the FALL and WINTER weather actually really comes alive for her. I just am not convinced, can I say that...I didn't really like the turns the characters took, and I didn't really feel the characterization very much. They were more stereotyped and superficial than I could fully get behind. Not all of the characters were developed in such a way that I really believed it...Also, some of the descriptions (esp. of small, rural, agricultural ways of life) were too romanticized. I liked it, but if it were candy it would be too sugary sweet, it left that sort of taste...someone that liked to glamorize the life and not really base it in a cruder sense of reality."}, {"userName": "Virginia", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/778936-virginia", "userReview": "This quite possibly rates the worst book I have ever read. The characters range from stupid to hedonistic The only reason I finished was that I hated the main character so much, I was hoping to read of his undoing. I did briefly believe that either the friend Susie or the daughter Gwen would make this a much more enjoyable book by putting Hollis in his place, but alas that happens quite anti-climatically with him destroying himself, and they end the book not as near as strong characters as could have been made of them. I guess I'm supposed to believe I am reading into the mind of a battered woman and her abuser, but I had a tough time believing that a successful woman with a very loving husband would give all that up for such a relationship. Also everyone around turns a blind eye to this woman's suffering, which I found totally irritating.I honestly have never been so mad at myself for reading a book.

Pisanje Alice Hoffman podsje\u0107a me na duboko more koje \u017eeli\u0161 istra\u017eiti i nisi zadovoljan s pu\u010dinom i onim \u0161to se vidi, pa ide\u0161 sve dalje i dalje od obale da bi \u0161to prije istra\u017eio nepoznat teren. E tako se uvijek ja osje\u0107am, kad uzmem neku njenu knjigu u ruke. \u017durim sa \u010ditanjem, jer ne mogu do\u010dekati njen kraj.Radnja knjige po\u010dinje kada 40-godi\u0161nja March Murray dolazi sa svojom k\u0107erkom tinej\u0111ericom u mjesto gdje je nekada \u017eivjela. Za to mjesto ve\u017eu ju uspomene: Lijepe i one manje lijepe. Sje\u0107a se svog djetinjstva i svoje prve velike ljubavi. Tada, oboje djeca, voljeli su se kako to zapravo djeca znaju:iskreno i nevino. Naravno, sve prave i velike ljubavi ne traju dugo, pa tako je i ova imala rok trajanja.I evo...nakon dvadesetak godina, March ponovo proganjaju duhovi pro\u0161losti, te ponovo nalazi tog istog dje\u010daka, a sada odraslog mu\u0161karca kojeg i nakon toliko puno vremena nije prestala voljeti.Me\u0111utim, taj dje\u010dak, a sada odrasto mu\u0161karac vi\u0161e nije isti.

Wow. Wow.\"Alice Hoffman really makes me happy. She's full of fanciful quirk -- not the harsh, dry quirk of carefully selected oddness, but a more delightful whimsy that seems to spring straight from the emotional side of nature.This book really won my heart, even though the ending was contrived and lacking in climax, which honestly, I'd half-expected since this book falls somewhere under the mainstream/literary spectrum. Okay, okay -- I saw her setting the climax up a mile away... but this kind of slap-bang happy ending really needs more set up than other, more logically likely endings. And besides the less-than-immaculate setup, she SKIPPED THE ACTUAL CLIMAX. For shame!So we all know that endings are the hardest part, and for a book this wonderful, okay, I can't help loving the book anyway, but GOSH DARN IT, you just don't skip such a critical juncture in the book, especially when you've been hopping in and out of that character's POV for the entirety of the novel. There's just no excuse for that. And even if she wanted to do it from another POV, at least show us the other character there *as it happens* instead of summarizing the event later! Arg.Oh, speaking of POV, I really loved the way that the narrative effortlessly hops in and out of the entire town's POVs, without losing the reader's comprehension or interest.

But very quickly, I realized I really didn't like March. She seemed whiny, indecisive, and just very lost in general. And then, as soon as we started getting the picture on Hollis, the bad taste in my mouth got worse. An dark, suave, but highly abusive, insecure, and often downright nasty man? And March is still passionately in love with this guy?Their relationship grew more and more painful to read, culminating in it being downright revolting. I was horrified at the terrible damage that March's stupidity had inflicted on her daughter and others in the town by the end, and her revelation at the end had no meaning because of how sudden and utterly obvious it was. As is usual with these books, there are one or two redeeming characters that keep the book from becoming truly awful. March's savvy teenage daughter Gwen, who sees everything her mother blindly ignores, is one of them. The bond she forms with the horse and her relationship with the gentle Hank, another redeeming character, are sweet. Otherwise, this book felt like one skewed moral after another."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5449722-barbara", "userReview": "Recognize this story? Wealthy father brings home street urchin, sister likes him, brother not so much. Already damaged by life on the streets and experience in juvie, he is pushed over the edge by the brother's rough treatment. Obsessed with acquisitiveness, he takes off for parts unknown, makes his fortune, and returns to buy up everything that belongs to those who've annoyed him.If you guessed Wuthering Heights, you'd be correct - one reviewer drew that comparison, and rather gushingly. This book asks the question, \"What might have happened if Heathcliff had gotten the girl back?\" - and answers \"Nothing good\".The writing is so focused on advancing the action and getting everyone through their required scenes that the author fails to develop strong characters. It was difficult to understand what made them tick; themes of consuming love, betrayal, second chances, and family dysfunction were all there, but left me unmoved. I got the theory, but couldn't buy into the result. Perhaps it's no surprise - you just can't squeeze Bronte into 293 big-print pages and achieve the same depth.Readable, but disappointing."}, {"userName": "Charity", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/129343-charity", "userReview": "Alice Hoffman has written a new version of Wuthering Heights, this time set in a remote, modern day New England village. Hollis is the dark-eyed orphan heartthrob brought into the Murray household. March is the spitfire who falls insanely in love with Hollis (and he returns the favor). Alan is March's slimy brother who persecutes Hollis. By and large, Hoffman follows the original plot faithfully, but it is her own lyrical prose which puts a pleasant spin on Bront\u00eb's dark tale of obsessive love. Many readers have observed that Wuthering Heights's story of mad love is a bit over the top. Yet in Hoffman's version, Hollis and March's intense, life-long romance is perfectly credible."}, {"userName": "Anita", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/809323-anita", "userReview": "Although this is a good read, it is a somewhat odd book. It deals the underside of \"love\" - in this case, obsession, control and abuse. This is the mother's story. The daughter's story deals with redemptive of qualities of love. And other supporting characters demonstrate other sides of love: selfless love, forbidden love and disappointed love. As I write this, I realize I should have liked this book much more than I did, given the themes.

Both the setting and the characters were stereotyped and cliched and I had a difficult time taking the novel very seriously. It was set in a stereotypical small town with very predicable characters such as the outcast, the gossip,and the recluse. As far as fiction goes, this novel brought nothing new to the genre and only succeeded in boring me with shallow characters who had no qualities that made me feel strongly about them. The author did not delve much into character history which made her characters even less appealing then they would have been had she focused more of her attention on their pasts. Here on Earth could have been a powerful novel about domestic issues and small town affairs but because it lacked good characterization and contained far too many cliches and stereotypes, it won't be on my list of recommended reads."}, {"userName": "Nikita T.

Let me just say that I read it in highschool and strongly disliked it - its not nice to say hated, you know. I must admit it seems like Hoffman stole some of her basic plot from Bront\u00eb but that doesn't mean that the two books are truly similar.

But even when her characters aren't blatantly magical, her stories have a mythic, and even allegorical quality, that I love. This is true of Here On Earth, which is the Bluebeardian story of a woman who comes back home and revisits the desperate love affair of her childhood.This book gives the first impression of being a romance, but it doesn't take long before the dark, haunted aspects of the characters and the story warn the reader that something isn't quite right. What started out as a tale of two lovers against the world begins to look more like a consuming and violent power struggle, or perhaps a dark fairy tale where the heroine falls asleep in the den of a monster and we're desperately hoping she'll wake up in time.Hoffman adds further drama and interest by dragging the main character's teenage daughter along for the ride. Her daughter's transformation from sulky teen to awakened young woman, and her ability to save herself from the destruction her mother seems to be heading toward, is one of the blessings of this book."}, {"userName": "Kara Hansen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10572178-kara-hansen", "userReview": "3 stars.

I had a strong emotional reaction to the book even before I found out it was based on Wuthering Heights, one of my obsessions. When March Murray returns to her hometown after some 15 years, she alternately dreads and craves a reunion with her childhood sweetheart. Hollis, now a wealthy and darkly handsome man, knows it's only a matter of time before she comes to him. When the two reunite, despite March's husband and daughter, they descend into a twisted and passionate relationship that might destroy them both. Complicating things are Hank, the son of Hollis's enemy whom he's raised since infancy, and Gwen, March's 15 year old daughter. The two teens fall in love, though their relationship is far healthier and sweeter than the older generation. Hollis was \"adopted\" by March's father, a respected attorney, and terrorized by Alan, her wastrel brother. When Mr. Murray dies, Alan relegates Hollis to the attic and treats him like an untouchable. It's this horrible youth that hardens an already stoic nature, and Hollis grows into a bitter, angry man who sleeps with half the townswomen and smothers March with his sick love. Will she give him a well-deserved kick in the ass? Will Hollis actually change for the better? Will Gwen and Hank run away together?No to every question. That's why this book, and Wuthering Heights, are so emotionally devastating. Characters never achieve happiness or transformation. What March believes is love with Hollis is simply nostalgia for the boy she loved as a girl, and his brand of love is nothing but desperation to dominate the woman who got away. Why does March believe she loves Hollis? He was there when she was an eleven year old kid and was mistreated by her brother. She saw a hurt and terrorized \"bad boy,\" mysterious and aloof. He was her first lover and they left each other as teens before she could ever realize just how unhealthy and villainous he really is, which is why she still retains an attachment to him.Hollis is incapable of love, but he is very much capable of possessiveness and lust. March was the one that got away, the girl who loved and petted him through his horrific childhood, and ultimately chose another man. He wants to own her and disdains not only her friends, but her daughter. His warped selfishness is evident when he tells March, after they meet again for the first time, that \"that baby\" was more important to her than he was. Correct, sir. The only kindness we see on Hollis's part is his adoption of Hank, Alan's son, after Alan falls into alcoholism after his wife dies in a fire. Hollis feeds and provides for Hank, though he certainly never cuddles or praises him, and Hank is the only one to mourn when the book reaches an inevitably pitiful conclusion. Hoffman is an adept storyteller, weaving beautiful descriptions, ripe emotions, and superstition together masterfully. Character development has never been her strong point, I don't believe, especially when she writes a novel of modest length (Second Nature, another novel, is a good example of this), but this is not a glaring problem with Here on Earth. You do get snippets and pieces of the characters that make them seem alive, but never a deep sense of who they really are and therefore, it can make you especially disdainful of their bad decisions and faults. The setting here is charming, as her settings usually are, and I so enjoy her descriptions of nature and the locales of the town. Hoffman loves magic and superstition, she seems to relish throwing in tidbits about midwives or what townspeople think cures this and that, and tying knots to secure a man's love, and how to make a child stop crying, et cetera, et cetera. It all makes for a magical experience and you wonder if there really could be places like the ones in her books. I love this book, I really do. I don't understand why I love it so much, along with Wuthering Heights, but this story speaks to something in me, as well as to many others. I give it 5 stars!"}, {"userName": "Judith", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8338351-judith", "userReview": "Beautiful treatment of some familiar themes: \"coming home\" and \"abusive relationships\". March Murray returns to her childhood home when the woman who was her caretaker - nanny, housekeeper, cook - dies. Judith Dale took over when March's mother died when March was very young, and stayed in the family house after the Murray family had all left it, by permission. March is here in Jenkintown, on the east coast, with her teenage daughter Gwen, to attend the funeral and to attend to Judith's remaining possessions.March's husband Richard did not come along. He has many classes and field trips to manage. He did, however, grow up here too, and has reason to be concerned about Marsh's trip.When March was small, her father arrived one day with a boy a few years older than she, Hollis, who had apparently been scraping out a living on his own. He was in pretty bad shape and had little experience with a normal life. March's father simply announced that Hollis was one of the family now. Unfortunately, not everyone in the family was happy to include him. March's older brother Alan feels a great deal of resentment at this intruder and never fails to find ways to remind Hollis that he is not really a member of the family. March, on the other hand, becomes quite fond of Hollis.As she grows older, she becomes more than fond. There is a quality about Hollis that draws her irresistibly, and he is similarly drawn to her. Their relationship becomes so intense that March manages to miss a lot of the rest of her life. She spends her time either with Hollis or thinking about him. But it isn't all happy sailing. There comes a time when Hollis demands March's attention in a way that irritates her and she tells him to go away. He does. And he does not come back. Eventually March goes on with her life but she secretly carries around her love for Hollis and knows she can never love anyone else the same way.Now it is nineteen years since she has set foot in this town and she knows Hollis is here, living here, still. She tells herself she will not see him but others know better. Hollis himself waits, knowing she will come to him.By this time Hollis has become a rich man and owns half the town. He has been married once, but that wife died. He lives with Alan's son, whom he has \"adopted\" after Alan took to drink and failed to care for the boy. Hollis may be able to buy out anyone else in the town but he's not well liked, except by the women he lets in from time to time.What happens when March and Hollis finally meet? Where does it lead?

I hate how this woman treats her life so carelessly; I would elaborate but I don\u2019t want to ruin it for those who have not read the book. Those of us who have, know what I mean! There are times you just want to smack her for being so selfish! And Hollis, he is so revengeful and mean. Yes, there are times we feel sad for the little boy that he was and we want to make it go away, but the grown man he becomes is shameful. Hank and Alan you just want to mother. Gwen you want to give a big hug and tell her how proud you are of her. Belinda and Richard are such good souls you wish they were part of your family.
