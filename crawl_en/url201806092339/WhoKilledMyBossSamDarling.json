Who doesn\u2019t imagine him or herself a cunning sleuth, able to solve whatever mystery life throws his or her way? But what if that mystery is murder?Author Jeri Dufresne delivers a fast-paced, entertaining mystery in Who Killed My Boss? in which social worker Samantha (Sam) Darling returns to her hometown to start a new job and finds her murdered boss on his office floor on her first day of work. Office employees, including the receptionist and other social workers, crowd into the boss\u2019s office, but Sam orders them out. Her brother\u2019s a cop, so she knows a little something about police work and gathering clues, and she decides she is going to solve the boss\u2019s murder. What better way to ensure that she keep her job at the clinic than to prove herself indispensable to them by finding the boss\u2019s killer? What ensues is danger and excitement, all wrapped in some lighthearted fun.Dufresne creates a fun, vivacious sleuth whom readers will identify with. Though Sam wants to solve the murder mystery in order to secure her brand new job, she slows down enough to care for her trusty dog, Clancy, with whom she has an almost psychic connection, as well as the people she interacts with. Readers will also laugh out loud at Sam\u2019s internal thoughts about her surroundings and her cohorts, which include a handsome private eye and an old friend who stood her up for the prom many years ago.This reader enjoyed Sam\u2019s first venture into sleuthing and looks forward to reading many more.Tracy Broemmer, author of the Lorelei Bluffs series"}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13173942-stephanie", "userReview": "Up front you need to know that I found about this book because a family member knows the author and it was a free Kindle download over the holidays so I picked it up and just got around to reading it.This is the first book in a series and I suspect the first book published (at least epublished) by the author. Unfortunately it shows. The writing is full of dull description and cliches and the characters are somewhat wooden. The plot is simple and for a mystery there is no tension. As with most mysteries it is told in first person which comes across almost as though the character was talking over lunch with a friend. Even the humor is flat more often than not. To be fair very few authors first published work is very polished and it is possible the second book in the series is better. There are some interesting themes and constructs in this book that if properly developed could be interesting, such as the telepathic link with the dog and her \"vibe\" sense, but in this story they were just there.Unfortunately for MS. Dufresne I have read almost the entire Grafton and Ian Rankin mystery/detective novels and am very spoiled by how good those books are. This author will need to write a lot more books and improve her craft tremendously to get anywhere near that level.I do encourage her to continue this series because if she can write with more feeling and depth, the basis for the series could become dynamic."}, {"userName": "Vicky", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4020222-vicky", "userReview": "I enjoyed the character, Samantha Darling and her fur ball Clancey. I also enjoyed her siblings, her neighbors Georgeanne and Gus, and her police officer friend BH (George). I liked that the book started out with the murder from the get go. I guessed who the murderer was but not the accomplice. The book was very enjoyable and quite easy reading yet there was a bit of suspense. I stumbled upon this book accidentally. I'm guessing there is a book preceding this one and more after. I'll have to check it out. Looking forward to reading more about Samantha's sleuthing adventures!!!!"}, {"userName": "Patricia Nielsen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29187776-patricia-nielsen", "userReview": "Really well done!

Sam Darling is in her early forties with two college kids and brothers and sisters, her best friend Clancy who's a dog(canine). Owners of her cottage and neighbors Gus and Georgianne Granville. A few characters who hated the dead man and could've killed him. Some people hated this book because the woman didn't act her age. It's just a fun book to read. Lots of people have heighten instincts like Sam does. I guess people who read this book needs to have a sense of human and a imagination."}, {"userName": "maryanne", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67810912-maryanne", "userReview": "So many cliches, so many hooks and threads taken from other writers. I felt as if the author was trying others styles out to see which fit best. The premise is good, I enjoyed some of the characters, but it didn't flow, the dialogue was stilted, and at times felt as if I were reading a story about a teenager, not a 40 something woman. Downloaded as a free book on my Kindle, Thankfully. Will probably try book 2 to see if any improvement, but only if it too, is free.

Sam was kind of pushy though and I hate pushy women. Anyway, she was fun, although she carried this grudge with B.H. a bit too far.

Stunned by his sudden death and desperate to keep the job she just got, Sam vows to find the killer.One of Sam\u2019s siblings is a cop, so she thinks the crime-solving skill must be genetic. Also, she\u2019s slightly psychic. She thinks solving the crime should be a snap, but it turns out to be more complicated than she thinks. Those vibes she gets can be hard to interpret, causing her more complications than she needs. She\u2019s assisted in her crime solving by her many siblings, her dog Clancy (who\u2019s also sort of psychic), and her elderly landlord, George. OK, so her vibes take her down the garden path a time or two, she eventually figures things out.This is the first book in the Darling Mysteries. Sam\u2019s parents died when she was young, but the family stayed close and in each other\u2019s business, but in a good way. Her family is one I\u2019d like to be a part of. There\u2019s a light touch of romance, a decent mystery, and some humor. A thoroughly enjoyable read. Book 2 is equally entertaining as well."}, {"userName": "Nadine", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9322537-nadine", "userReview": "What a fun book. I love the family dynamics...including Clancy ...human dog. At times the reading was a little stiff, and I thought that Sam, like most of us could use a little growing up. I would like to think that a therapist would have a little more common sense. But what the heck, we all have our downfall. I look forward to reading the nest book in the series and have faith that such talent will only continue to improve with each book in the series. I especially liked reading the author biography at the end to see that her family and career background is similar. What a fun way to write,using your life background to expand into a fictional , amusing read."}, {"userName": "Kay (Brigidsmomma) Compton", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37593918-kay-brigidsmomma-compton", "userReview": "I. really enjoyed this book.
