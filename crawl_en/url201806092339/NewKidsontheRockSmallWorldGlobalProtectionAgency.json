(He's also a brother Trestle Press author, which is why I refrain from rating the work.)It should be stated at the outset that this is probably not the sort of kid's fiction that would also interest most adults. I liked Madison and Josh well enough; and I'd say that Miller does a good job of presenting some details of local color in his Australian setting (I've been to Australia and have family there, so I know something about this) and reproducing idiomatic Aussie speech, especially in Mick's dialogue. (Good on ya, mate!) And he handles his prose well. But by adult standards, the plot is shallow, and the premise and the villain fairly cartoonish. (That the SF elements --the Star Trek-style matter transporters and James Bondish gadgetry-- are \"soft\" science-fiction is no criticism in itself, but their role in the story is sometimes not the most plausible.) And despite the claim that in some instances kids can do jobs that adult agents can't, I don't see that as being true here.All of that said, though, adults aren't the target audience here; kids are. And I could definitely see pre-teen kids eating this up with a spoon! The inherent wild implausibility of the premise won't bother them; kids often like to identify with child protagonists in heroic roles, and they tend to feel that they're more capable of handling difficult challenges than adults give them credit for. (Sometimes they actually are.) There are no objectionable language or sexual elements, or excessive violence, here that would disturb kids (or their parents). The physical and mental challenges the hero/heroine face are actually within the capability of smart kids with athletic and martial arts training to meet (of course, it helps that they're dealing with particularly cretinous and careless bad guys; otherwise, they'd be in more trouble :-) ). It's a nice touch that we have both a male and a female co-protagonist, to appeal to kid readers of both genders. And the discussion questions at the end are a plus, IMO. In short, I'd say this promises to be a series that could be quite popular with kids in this age bracket! The one operative question is whether the Kindle format is the optimum one for reaching this age group. Hopefully, the publisher will eventually bring these stories out in a paperback edition; school and children's librarians would definitely want to consider it in that event."}, {"userName": "Giovanni Gelati", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3474899-giovanni-gelati", "userReview": "I enjoy sharing stuff to read with my younger kids.

This selection only cost $0.99, but it is only one chapter's worth of story. The second thing to say is that, in general, I am not a fan of short stories I just get into them - and they are over. Now, for the story (I can't quite refer to it as a book, since it really isn't). The premise is interesting, but there isn't nearly enough development for me. So far, everyone seems like a stereotype, from the kid-jock and the other kid-computer geek to the threatening-secret agent, the out-back-kid, the nondescript out-back girl place-holder, the aboriginal jeep driver, and quite a few other minor characters. For such a short excerpt, there just isn't enough of a hook there. I can't really care about any of the characters yet - and the problem has just barely started. It is an interesting idea and it may appeal to its target audience - middle grade kids who like action and adventure, but I will need to debate with myself long and hard, before I commit too much to it. There are so many good books out there. But I am a sucker for things that have to do with geography and, in this instance, Australia, so who knows, maybe I will try at least the rest of this story."}, {"userName": "LauraW", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2400015-lauraw", "userReview": "So, yeah, I did read the second part of this adventure - just for completeness' sake and I stand by my earlier review. The characters are stereotypes, the adventure is predictable, the writing is straightforward and not especially compelling. This might be redeemed, if some of the other promised elements were worthwhile, but the geography is even faulty. If you land at Uluru, it is around 1,778 MILES to Sydney. You can't expect to cover this much territory in one nap (the drive to Sydney) or one brief conversation (the drive back from Sydney). And, there is very little water along the way, so the chances of meeting that crocodile are pretty slim. Sigh. I will try something else."}], "description": "Star athlete Josh and computer prodigy Madison are recruited by the mysterious Mr. Crux to attend a special summer camp.
