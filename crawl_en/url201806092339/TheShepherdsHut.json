I would frequently spend part of a Sunday afternoon at my favorite bookstore which sadly is no longer in existence. I would browse the shelves not looking for anything in particular and I picked up Cloudstreet because I was attracted to the title. I bought it, read it and loved it . After that I read Dirt Music and Breath. I was drawn to read this because of my enjoyment of those novels. If you haven\u2019t read Winton, I would recommend starting with one of his earlier works. If you are a Winton fan, I definitely recommend it. This is the raw and rough to read story of Jaxie Clackton, a teenage boy on the run through the brutal and wild outback, not for anything he\u2019s done but for what\u2019s been done to him. He\u2019s on the run from his miserable young life of physical abuse and feeling like the outcast. The first part of the book, a profile in loneliness is rather sad as Jaxie recounts his past. He\u2019s a pitiful soul, in spite of the rough talk and vulgarity . He has no family or friends , only the fear of being caught for something he didn\u2019t do and the hope that he could get to the girl he loves, his cousin. He\u2019s tough but vulnerable when he crosses paths with Fintan MacGillis, an ex priest, living a secluded life in the wild. It\u2019s this unlikely friendship that impacts Jaxie on his way forward.I have to admit that I didn\u2019t quite get all of the slang and had to google a few words if I couldn\u2019t guess the meaning. Some of the more profane were easy to guess. If you are sensitive to this, it may not be for you. Another warning - there is killing of animals for food but there is one scene of animal cruelty that was hard to read. In spite of these reservations, I thought it was a moving story of a boy\u2019s journey to manhood. I received an advanced copy of this book from Farrah, Straus and Giroux through NetGalley."}, {"userName": "Fran", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12653120-fran", "userReview": "Jackson \"Jaxie\" Clackton, 16 years old, was continually abused by his dad, Sid Clackton. Clackton, master butcher in the town of Monkton, used Jaxie as a punching bag. Jaxie was a bad tempered school delinquent nicknamed \"Jaxie Horsemeat\" by his peers. In turn, he enjoyed punching students for ill-treating him. Jaxie was currently nursing a black eye given to him during one of Clackton's drunken rages. Wishing and hoping his dad would die, imagine his shock finding his father crushed under a car, Apparently, the vehicle slipped off a high-lift jack in the shed. Fear of being blamed for his father's death caused Jaxie to quickly leave home. He headed north for Magnet, approximately 300 kilometers from Monkton. His meager supplies included an Igloo jug, a rifle with ammo, four oranges and a pair of binoculars.Jaxie knew how to hunt and butcher, however, all he had with him for butchering was a butter knife. His trip plan was as follows: keep his \"sh**\" together, rest, find water, and get to Magnet to see girlfriend Lee, the one person he felt connected to. Soon, his Igloo jug was pretty near empty, his bad eye throbbed and his rifle was getting mighty heavy. His trek across the vast Australian Outback was brutal and unforgiving. He must replenish his water supply, and soon. Finally, he happened upon the hut of Fintan MacGinnis, a singing, loquacious Irishman who claimed that his abode, in the middle of nowhere, was his refuge as well as exile. Fintan, a mysterious solitary man encouraged Jaxie to stay for a while.Two souls, one starting life's journey while the other's journey winding down, are both damaged individuals. Was any human connection possible? The harshness and brutalities of life were ever present in this novel, be they the unforgiving land or the cruelty of one's fellow man. The colorful, vernacular language definitely gave \"The Shepherd's Hut\" a gritty, hardscrabble feel. As a reader unfamiliar with the writing of Tim Winton, I was unaware that he is one of Australia's most acclaimed authors. \"The Shepherd's Hut\" was an awesome and excellent introduction to Winton's literary gems! I highly recommend this book!Thank you Farrar, Straus and Giroux and Net Galley for the opportunity to read and review \"The Shepherd's Hut\"."}, {"userName": "Bianca", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29843800-bianca", "userReview": "It is a big event in the Australian publishing world whenever Tim Winton comes up with a new book. This highly anticipated novel didn\u2019t disappoint. The more I think about it, the more I\u2019m impressed. I mean, I shouldn\u2019t be, because it\u2019s Tim Freakin\u2019 Winton. Every author has the right to come up with duds now and then. You probably heard people-in-the-know bemoaning the dying literary novel etc. It may be so, but don\u2019t tell that to the many people who buy Tim Winton\u2019s novels. Case in point, a few weeks after its release, this is still in the top 10 bestseller list.On the surface, The Sheperd\u2019s Hut is a simple novel about an abused fifteen-year-old, Jaxie Clackton, fleeing his hometown. He thinks the police is after him, so he hides in the outback, although he\u2019s unprepared. This is the solitary walkabout of a white teenager, on the path to adulthood.Jaxie\u2019s is a story of survival, both spiritual and physical. He's such an interesting bloke. To be honest, when I heard this was a first person POV novel, I feared I won\u2019t like it, especially given my previous experience with much loved Australian novels which also featured kids/teenagers (Jasper Jones, The Choke). So, I didn\u2019t expect to be so taken with Jaxie, to care so much.I must applaud Winton for having the audacity to use the language he did, although if anyone can get away with it, it\u2019s him. The language is rough, Australian slang and expletives heavy \u2013 but it felt authentic. In spite of the lower class language in use, Winton succeded to write a very atmospheric novel. And all this about the outback, which is mostly dry and flat.The novel has only two protagonists, Jaxie and the old, Irish recluse he meets in the outback. Their relationship was interesting and unexpected. Winton steered clear from sentimentality, I admire that a great deal.The Sheperd\u2019s Hut is a masterfully crafted novel, unique, with unforgettable characters and it's quintessentially Australian. In my view, this novel has the makings of an Australian classic novel, just like Cloudstreet.This novel goes towards my Australian Author Challenge on www.bookloverbooksreviews.com."}, {"userName": "John Purcell", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3881494-john-purcell", "userReview": "Brutal.

But I\u2019m sure glad I did. This felt different to Cloudstreet as the writing here feels raw, intense and brutal it\u2019s a story that wasn\u2019t easy to read but I was compelled nevertheless. The Australian remote bush setting and the language was used effectively to draw me into Jaxies\u2019 story. The language is as rough as Jaxie himself, but it\u2019s also it\u2019s charm if you can get past the Aussie vernacular, it is not at all diluted, non Australian readers might struggle! I wasn\u2019t sure where the story was headed but I was invested until the last section where it sort of fell off and ended quite abruptly. It\u2019s clear that Tim Winton is a writer with immense talent so I\u2019m pleased that this book cemented my faith in him again. I might even polish off Cloudstreet finally...It was a solid 4 stars until the rushed ending."}, {"userName": "Ace", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23405868-ace", "userReview": "Ok, I basically stopped breathing for the last section of this book.

The story is told from the perspective of protagonist and antihero Jaxie Clackton (who speaks in strong Australian slang), a teenage boy who grew up with a violent, alcoholic father and a mother who stood by and failed to protect him, until she finally died from cancer. When his father dies by accident, Jaxie fears that he will be blamed because everybody knew that he hated his dad (thus inferring that the whole community must have known about his situation, but nobody stepped in). As a consequence, Jaxie decides to run away and goes on a journey through the Australian wilderness in order to pick up his cousin Lee, whom he loves, and ultimately build a better life with her. When he comes across an old shepherd's hut which is inhabited by a mysterious former priest, this encounter will change Jaxie's life forever.This novel is not for the faint of heart: There is a lot of blood and slaughtering (literal and metaphorical) going on, and Jaxie, who has never been protected and cared for by his parents, is shockingly brutal and caught up in his idea that he needs to show disaffection and what he perceives as strength at all times. His disconnection and alienation becomes almost unbearable to read when he talks about his cruelty against animals. Pain, killing and death are major themes in the book, and the questions what differentiates dead meat from a living creature and whether there is something like a \"good death\" lead directly to the existential challenge to find something to live for. As you might expect in a novel that stars an Irish-Catholic ex-priest and a teenager from Monkton (Monk-ton, got it?) hanging out in a shepherd's (!) hut near a salt (!) lake, the author contemplates questions of spirituality, using biblical themes and letting his characters meditate on pantheism in the Australian wilderness. But the question whether there is a God or not is not the main concern here; rather, it's the question how to overcome alienation and loneliness, how to learn empathy and to feel connected to nature and other people. Ultimately, it's also the question of how we can feel ourselves. I really enjoyed how Winton managed to convey the inner workings of Jaxie, and how is whole persona is challenged and questioned by someone who simply sees him and listens to him. This is a terribly disturbing and brutal story of redemption, and it is equally cruel and beautiful."}, {"userName": "Trudie", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4617856-trudie", "userReview": "I am beginning to know early on now when I am about to 5-star a book, and in this case the opening chapter pretty much confirmed it. For me there was just something magical in the writing even before the story takes shape. It's a good sign when time outside the book ceases to exist, your right there camping in the Salmon gums with Jaxie Clackton. Getting the \"yips\" as he would say, but being too staunch to admit it. If the great Australian western was a genre then Tim Winton would be the master.The landscape of Western Australia is nearly always the canvas in Wintons work but also a character and I felt that particularly in this book. From the claustrophobic hopelessness of small town Monkton, to the vast tracks of wild inhospitable land, dotted with derelict miners shacks. It's beautiful and menacing. Winton plays so cleverly with foreshadowing in this book. Seemingly insignificant details such as wind shifts, and sudden odd silences create a mood where both the reader and the characters are jumping at shadows. It's a magnificent writer who can use landscape like this and keep me interested when for pages it is just one character moving through it with only his thoughts for company. Oh but what a character he is. Jaxie Clackton's voice is hard to shake - foul-mouthed in a most gloriously Australian way, violent, yes, shockingly so, damaged, impulsive, resilient. He absolutely will make or break this novel for you. While he is certainly very much a singular youth in some ways - he makes short work of field-dressing a Kangaroo and knows how to survive alone on a perilous trek. The kind of emotional and physical abuse he deals with is a universal theme.I guess you could call this a very \"muscular\" coming-of-age novel but that is to lessen it somehow as it's so much more than that. The finer details of this book are impossible to discuss in a review without ruining the reading experience for others, but trust me I think the journey is worth it.Basically, if you already know you love Tim Winton you won't be disappointed in this and if this is your first book from him then it's a great introduction. However, fair warning, many animals were harmed in the making of this story. While it is probably not Cormac McCarthy violent, it is unflinching. You may also need a guide to Australian slang...."}, {"userName": "Gumble's Yard", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35482263-gumble-s-yard", "userReview": "Anything with blood in it can probably go bad. Like meat. And it\u2019s the blood that makes me worry. It carries things you don\u2019t even know you got. Sometimes I wonder if that nasty meanness is in me too, like he\u2019s passed it on. Does that mean I\u2019m gunna be that way? To Lee? And our own kids ... thinking like that puts the wind up me. To live you gotta be hard, I know that.\nI was drawn to this book, my first by this (twice Booker shortlisted) author, by an intriguing excerpt in The Guardian from a speech he gave while promoting the book, one in which he sets out clearly his interest in exploring the topic of toxic masculinity and it's poisonous influence on boys in turn marginalised by society. https://www.theguardian.com/books/201...The book is about one such boy Jaxie, who lives in a small Western Australian twin with his mother and physically abusive father - whose own actions and character it is hinted come from wartime traumas witnessed in Vietnam or Korea. All the mechanisms which should protect Jaxie against the abuse fail him: institutional - his school are focused on dealing with the symptoms of the abuse as they emerge in Jamie's violent and delinquent behaviour (the passing on of the toxicity) and have no interest in the causes; societal - his father's friendship with the police chief of the small town causes his neighbours to turn a blind eye and deaf ear; familial - Jaxie long assumed his mother's actions, even her unwillingness to leave his father, are focused on protecting him, but after a pivotal row one Christmas (when his father discovers his clandestine physical relationship with his cousin Lee) he realises even his mother will not protect him; his cousin is forbidden contact and his mother soon succumbs to cancer cementing his sense of abandonment. All of this is recounted in flashback, the actual narrative of the novel beginning when Jaxie stumbles across his father's dead body, crushed under the car he was working on, and convinced he will be accused of engineering the death, decides to flee to the deserted outback, with an eventual I'll thought through plan to get to and elope with his cousin, hundreds of miles North. His father was a butcher and the tracking, survival and butchering skills Jaxie has picked up as part of his poisonous inheritance just about serve to keep him alive. At a pivotal point he decides to venture to a salt plain as he needs a preservation mechanism for the meat he is hunting and there stumbles across another person living in the wilds - Fintan, an Irish priest, seemingly placed in a rough shepherds hut by his church as some form of part punishment/part isolation for some only ever hInted at actions he committed and atrocities (perhaps anti-communist massacres) he witnessed. Jaxie, perhaps for the first time, being given the benefit of the doubt by an adult, teaches an uneasy truce with Fintan and the two live in close proximity.\nThing is, this old dude couldna known that. He just rolled the dice, didn\u2019t he? He wondered if I was a civilized man, like he said. Then he bet his life on it. But that didn\u2019t mean I could trust him. A bloke that doesn\u2019t shoot you on sight, a man who offers you a feed, he could still be the one puts you in to the cops.\nBoth elements of the Fintan character as an Irish priest are important. The Irish / Australian link features in the Wild Colonial Boy, an Irish-Aussie ballad that Fintan songs when Jaxie first meets him and in their terrible closing encounter and one which could have been an alternate title for this book. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_W...Religion, faith, redemption, death, justice, sacrifice, good and evil all feature heavily in the book - as Fintan shares something of his life and worldview and gradually allows Daxie to re examine his own. Flawed families are also important - both Daxie and Fintan simultaneously abandoned by and hugely resentful of their family (the Catholic church for the latter) but also finding in it their only sustenance (physical for Fintan, emotional for Daxie) that ultimately allows them to continue. A sense of place is vital to this novel. Unlike the typical Western Australian coastal settings of Winton\u2019s novels, this is set in the desolate salt planes and old gold mines of the state. A location Winton has said he had always wanted to use as a setting for a novel but one rich with symbolism for his thesis on the crisis of masculinity. Referring back to the speech above, the desolation of abandoned gold mines and prospector huts stands in for the way traditional masculinity has been justifiably hollowed out, but not replenished with any new sustainable form of male identity:\nWe\u2019ve scraped our culture bare of ritual pathways to adulthood. There are lots of reasons for having clear-felled and burnt our own traditions since the 1960s, and some of them are very good reasons. But I\u2019m not sure what we\u2019ve replaced them with. We\u2019ve left our young people to fend for themselves. \nAnd the harsh poisoned salt mines for the toxicity of what currently stands as modern masculinity \nWhat are we left with? The sly first beer your uncle slips you. The 18th birthday party where the keg is the icon. Maybe the B&S ball, if you live in the bush. First drink, first root, first bog-lap in your mum\u2019s Corolla. Call me a snob, but that strikes me as pretty thin stuff. This, surely, is cultural impoverishment. And in such a prosperous country. To my mind, that\u2019s salt rising to the surface, poisoning the future.\nThe book is recounted in the first person by Jaxie, whose speech is reproduced by Winton raw, salted (just as Jaxie salts his meat) with Aussie expletives and slang (although nothing an English reader would not understand immediately - Ute, VB, Abo) - I had originally used the word unfiltered, but actually it becomes clear that the book is in fact told as remembered by Jaxie later and explicitly filtered through and altered by the shift in his worldview from his encounter with Fintan. Fintan's speech (as remembered by Jaxie) is littered with Irish (i particularly enjoyed \"look at you with your orangemans stare\") and biblical allusions (I noted phrases from Proverbs, Daniel, Ecclesiastes, 1 Samuel, John).The book reminded me of Cormac McCarthy's the road and follows I think in the tradition of Hucklebery Finn - a book Winton lead with in a recent interview when asked to list his favourite books of all time. In the following question, asked to identify the last good book he read, Winton plumped for Jon McGregor, not Reservoir 13 though (despite describing it as great) but Even The Dogs - and ultimately the two books have much in common: powerful but uncomfortable reads, confronting difficult elements in their society, alluding to the aftermath of active military service in creating those elements, but acting as an urgent plea for readers not to judge the actions and dates of those elements, but simply to start to try and understand and engage with them.

So I had to see what I was missing! The plot sounded like it would be interesting since it was set in Australia's outback and I've always found Australia to be such an interesting country. The first few chapters were raw and brutal. Jaxie Clackton's mother is dead and his father, who has abused Jaxie all his life, dies a violent death. Jaxie runs from home thinking he will be blamed for his father's death. All he takes with him are a water jug and a rifle as he sets out walking through the Australian wilderness to the only person who has ever understood him, his cousin Lee. During his lonely journey he discovers a priest in exile, Finton McGinnis. Jaxie doesn't know what the priest did or whether he can trust him, but they strike up an uneasy friendship and Jaxie stays with him awhile. The story of this strange friendship and what is occurring in the salt lands is central to this story.There were many Australian slang words and phrases I didn't recognize and had to look them up, but I found the local language and scenery fascinating.

His latest novel, The Shepherd\u2019s Hut, is an urgent tale about a young man who has been let down by every person he has ever encountered; he\u2019s slipped through all the cracks in every system and now, on the cusp of adulthood, he\u2019s shaping up to be exactly what everyone expected him to be: his father \u2013 a specimen of male toxicity made to order. Can you escape your legacy? Is there any point even trying? Winton examines this as he plunges us into Jaxie and the immersion is so entire that you truly feel as though you are there, in the moment, observing everything without barrier.Jaxie is not a character you\u2019re meant to like, but he is someone I had a well of empathy for. Jaxie is what you get when people shrug and turn the other way in the face of domestic violence and unchecked bullying. Jaxie is who evolves when complacency kicks in. What you turn away from is what you accept and Winton draws this conclusion very clearly, very early on in the novel. But Jaxie is also a human being, craving connection, harbouring hope; it\u2019s not too late for Jaxie, although he\u2019s cutting it very fine, yet he\u2019s aware of this, of what he doesn\u2019t want to be, of who he doesn\u2019t want to turn out like. I can\u2019t commend Tim Winton enough for his insight into this characteristic of an abused child: in the absence of not knowing who you are, knowing who you don\u2019t want to be can sometimes be enough to get you there in the end.Human connection runs like a vein through all of Winton\u2019s work. It humbles me, how he brings everything back to this basic need with such precision. Fintan is a mystery, the who and why of him never really clarified, and it doesn\u2019t matter in the end because of the gift he gives Jaxie at such a pivotal time in this young man\u2019s existence.\u201cI think he knew I was there. He felt me. He always knew what I was. He saw me coming before I knew I was even there. And now I saw him too.\u201dDid I think by the end that Jaxie was going to be okay? Not really, but he did, and that\u2019s all that matters. Hope is a powerful motivator.This is a brutal novel, make no mistake, the depravity of humans unmasked and hung out to dry. The vastness of the Australian outback is depicted with a harsh reality and a sense of knowing that this is a place that people can easily disappear into. Jaxie\u2019s voice is so completely authentic; he is one of Winton\u2019s finest characters to date.\u201cIt was like I started wanting him to speak as much as those arseholes did. Maybe more. To make it stop. But also so I could know what Fintan really thought. About who I was. Maybe even what I was. All of a sudden this was deadly important. My heart was bursting to know. And I wouldn\u2019t care if he did give me up. Christ, I wished he would. If only he\u2019d say something true about me.

Recently I was in my local library and saw The Shepherd\u2019s Hut amongst the new releases and I thought what the hell, it\u2019s reasonably short so I grabbed it and gave him another go.Be warned, the story is told in the first-person narrative of teenager Jaxie Clackton, a kid full of anger and frustration, and there are profanities littered throughout the book with the c word getting plenty of airing. The peculiar Aussie vernacular can be tricky to get your head around, especially so for readers from other countries I would imagine. I found the first third of the book tough going but it picked up when Jaxie reached the shepherd\u2019s hut but then it ended pretty abruptly without us knowing much about the priest Fintan who was living in the hut nor do we really get to know much about Jaxie. I felt we simply spent a few days inside the mind of this angry young man and I just don\u2019t think the book had much to say, either about toxic masculinity or anything else, and it ended all too soon for my liking. You\u2019ve got to admire Tim Winton for what he tries to accomplish and I would urge you to read other people\u2019s reviews as there is a high overall rating for this book.

Lets be brutally honest, Jaxie is a violent, aggresive bully who has had a difficult childhood to say the least. His mother, who he never really knew at all, has died from cancer and his father beats him to a pulp with the slightest provocation.The story starts when Jaxie returns home to find his father killed in an accident, fearing that he will undoubtably get blamed, he grabs what he can and takes to the road.In a nutshell this is where the heart of the story lies. During his travels he has time to look back and reflect upon his childhood and upbringing. Winton does this in his brilliant \"Aussie style\". In fact I would not be surprised if some non-aussie readers may find it a bit of a slog, the slang is that strong.This may sound as if it's a bit dull, but it's anything but, Winton manages to keep the suspense going from start to finish and the book builds to an amazing climax.I really feel to say anymore would start to bring spoilers into play. With this book the reader needs to follow Jaxie both physically and mentally without knowing where he is going.

His earthy, sometimes supernatural novels arise out of his native Western Australia, which is the setting for The Shepherd's Hut, his latest. Here is the story of Jaxie Clackton, a 15 year old troublemaker who on the basis of an extraordinarily brutal childhood, takes off across the salt lakes in the belief that the law is hard on his heels. Jaxie narrates using the vernacular of his rough life, owning up to his bad choices, taking blame whether justified or not. When he comes across a fellow exile, there is mistrust on his side despite no obvious threat, and he finds his inner world expanded as his external life continues to meet challenges. Recently there seem to have been a rash of novels about feral children usually victims of abuse or neglect who take to the wilds, but this novel is in a class by itself."}, {"userName": "Louise", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14557077-louise", "userReview": "The dust cover reviews of The Shepherd\u2019s Hut (including one from the celebrated Australian author Geraldine Brooks which predicts that Jaxie Clackton is destined to become one of the greatest characters in Australian literature), pre and post publication publicity and my admiration for Tim Winton\u2019s works (especially Cloud Street and The Turning) had me \u00a0scurrying to my library to collect my reserved copy of The Shepherd\u2019s Hut. Unfortunately my enthusiasm was short-lived; the novel was not to my liking. The first half of the novel recounts Jaxie\u2019s tragic backstory as well as revealing his justifiably chaotic thoughts and actions on his solo journey through the inhospitable Australian Outback; in the hands of a writer of Winton\u2019s calibre this should have been riveting stuff but I found it exceptionally tedious.The novel\u2019s second half gathers pace and interest courtesy of the dissection of the complex, demanding relationship between the young firebrand Jaxie and the mysterious recluse Fintan MacGillis.This, added to a welcome heightening of tension in the novel's latter stages was not enough however to dispel the \u2018 boys own\u2019 vibe of the story and my overall disappointment with the novel.

His voice will likely remain with me, just as Sammy\u2019s Glaswegian voice in James Kelman\u2019s 1994 Booker Prize winning How Late It Was, How Late remains with me years after I read it.

With his latest print offering a case could be mounted for this accolade. His Australianness makes him unique, particularly when he comes up with such use of the vernacular, in such crude poetic glory, as in 'The Shepherd's Hut'. It's up there with 'The Riders' and 'Dirt Music'; its Jackson (Jaxie) Clackton with Scully, Luther Fox and the denizens of 'Cloudstreet'. This outback centred stunner will linger long in the synapses. After the relative disappointment of 'Eyrie' and his memoirs, for this fan, our GLA is back on song.Just as we can celebrate this, we can also re-celebrate 'Breath' anew. His 2008 publication sang of the sea, the coastal littoral and some of the mystique of surfing culture. Simon Baker's directorial debut for the big screen has bought this Winton work back to life \u2013 and it's a beautiful thing to behold.The movie takes us to a surfers' paradise, but as far removed from sun blasted beaches as it is possible to be. Set around Denmark, on the south coast of WA, I do not think the sun settled once, for the duration of the film, on the bleached hair and kombis of this part of the surfing landscape. There, like my own island, could be considered as part of the Australian sport's new frontier. Pikelet (Samson Coulter) and Loonie (Ben Spence) are in their early teens, just putting their toe in the water as far as this recreational outlet is concerned. Along comes former surfing god Sando, Baker himself, as their mentor \u2013 and he's full of it. He's a bit of a dick, actually, as he challenges the lads' manhood, virtually forcing them to take on monster breaks that would make any parent shake in their boots at \u2013 if they knew. Loonie, as his name suggests, is up for anything and knows no fear, but the far more reticent Pikelet isn't so swayed by Sando's reputation (just who did leave those old surfing mags lying around?) and bullshit.Sando has a missus. Eva, a former skiing champ, is recovering from a possible career ending accident on the piste. She is a distant and dissatisfied figure, clearly not all that enamoured of Sando's big-noting to the boys. When he pisses off to Indonesia, the susceptible Loonie in tow, Eva seduces the at-a-loss Pikelet. He starts to see the world, as a result, from a different perspective and begins to become the man, we suspect, neither Loonie or Sando could ever be. Although the sex aspect caused some minor gnashing of teeth, it was tastefully handled by Baker.The brooding coastline, capable of producing maelstroms with little notice; the surfing under grey and always foreboding skies, were a masterful, evocative aspect of both the book and film. At times, though, the lack of acting chops by the two young thesps \u2013 they were chosen for their looks and prowess in the swell \u2013 is on show. As well, the movie almost outlasted my bladder \u2013 there could have been a bit more judicious editing. But it is a worthy match to the great man's own words \u2013 and as a bonus the writer himself is the adult narrating voice of Pikelet.And his words don't get much better than in 'The Shepherds Hut'. With young Clackton he has gifted us a character for the ages. With verbal brilliance the author takes us on a journey with Jaxie to the great beyond of nothingness that outwardly are the West Australian deserts. Inwardly, Winton's wordsmithery makes them come alive, giving up their primal burnished beauty, becoming the exact opposite.Winton's hard done by, but bush savvy, hero flees out into the scrub when he discovers his violent excuse for a piece of shit father squashed and lifeless under the Hilux. He calls his obnoxious old man Captain Wankbag and has had a lifetime of being belted mercilessly by him. It's a fact well known around the blowfly blown community that's the pair's home. His mother, similarly pummelled by the vicious Sid, has, perhaps thankfully, succumbed to cancer a while back. The old bastard is the town's provider of meat \u2013 to call him a butcher would denigrate that profession - and is therefore tolerated despite his unpalatable ways. Jaxie knows a suspicious eye will be placed on his culpability for what occurred to the scumbag beneath the ute, so off he goes. Besides, there is a solitary shining light in his life and she lives in another blighted collection of buildings on up the road a fair distance. He knows he must avoid civilisation at all costs, but he's woefully under-prepared for a bush bash, although he is at peace with the lie of the land and that must count for something.Even so, he's on his last legs when he encounters the wonderfully monikered Fintan MacGillis. He's a mystery, seemingly biblically banished to the arid wastelands to largely live off the land, as barren as it is. He is slowly addling-up through loneliness. But such is their collective predicament, when Jaxie comes across him, they very soon discover they are in dire need of what the other can give. The worn, fat ex-priest has a hut \u2013 and that's salvation for the boy. But can the unlikely duo cope with such a harsh, unforgiving environment and survive, given its about to give up a few secrets?Like the best of Winton 'The Shepherd's Hut' compels; it mesmerises in a way akin to the mirages on the salt lake that is close company to the shanty the two protagonists share in wary proximity. It's a truly beautiful work, even in its brutality and brutal language. It tells us there has to be hope \u2013 there just has to be."}, {"userName": "Anita Tymkiw", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63449373-anita-tymkiw", "userReview": "Tim Winton is a master story teller. At first I was worried that the central character, Jaxie, a loner and victim of domestic violence, was going to be a cliche. Yes he is a troubled, teenage delinquent, but as he flees his home in order to escape blame for the accidental death of his violent, alcoholic father, we see he has a strong sense of doing the right thing and just striving for self-protection, love and acceptance like every other human. This love and acceptance is depicted by his girlfriend (and cousin) who is also denied to him by the adults in his life. There are many similarities in 'The Shepherd's Hut' with his earlier book 'Breath'. Tim Winton really has an affinity with the Australian landscape and I love how he can show the goodness in flawed characters. Both books are about a young teenage boy that are confronted with life changing scenarios and in the course of their troubles, reveal a wisdom well beyond their years. Jaxie is presented with lots of colourful, Aussie flavoured dialogue which can be funny at times. 'The Shepherd's Hut' also features a defrocked priest and musings on God which are central to the story but echo their appearance in 'Breath'. In any case, both books represent excellent reading."}, {"userName": "Brona's Books", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30281718-brona-s-books", "userReview": "The Shepherd's Hut is Tim Winton's much anticipated latest novel. I am a fan, but with reservations. I loved Cloudstreet and Dirt Music but hated The Riders (it has the dubious honour of being one of my very first DNF books). Breath was good but a bit blokey and Eyrie was okay, but a bit blokey. I adore his children's picture book illustrated by Karen Louise called The Deep. And his essays in The Boy Behind the Curtain were truly luminous.So I entered The Shepherd's Hut cautiously.The first 20 or so pages were a struggle for me. I know that there are awful dad's out there, I know what they can do. I used to be a teacher, I've helped families negotiate some of these difficult times over the years. But I don't feel the need to read about such sad, brutal things.So I struggled with the first part of the story where we experience Jaxie's dysfunctional relationship with his father. I thought, I can't do this.Later that night, I tried again.Suddenly, without spoiling anything for anyone, Jaxie is on the run and we have a full-on road trip survival story underway.

The Shepherd's Hut is his twelfth full length novel since 1982's The Swimmer, alongside a number of short stories and other writings.It may be a big call, considering the high bar he has set with Cloudstreet, Dirt Music and his other novels but I predict The Shepherd's Hut will come to be recognised as his finest. Jaxie is a simple sole child, whose mother has not long died after a profoundly distressing battle with cancer. Jax's father is an evil man who has bashed him regularly and without mercy for years. His reaction to a watershed moment Jaxie takes off, equipped with only what he can carry, and with the intention of putting as much distance between himself and the home he hates.The most notable aspect, among many, in the Shepherd's Hut, is that Tim Winton delivers his character Jaxie in a verbatim style, unvarnished, and in the often offensive language of the teenager that he is. To my mind this technique is the approach that makes this highly emotional story work. He literally takes us inside Jax's head, sometimes with mind blowing consequences.Jaxie meets and eventually teams up with another disparate and anti social character Fintan, an elderly man who is living in an old cottage, about as far off the grid as you can get. Jax and Fintan circle around each other for days, but eventually a friendship is developed.With his loosely developed plan of hooking up with Lee, a girl he has come to see as his future, Jaxie is torn between moving on across the scrubby and remote lands, or staying in the safety of Fintan's cottage.The Shepherd's Hut is Tim Winton at his very best.

You can breathe the dust, feel its rough edges, hear every sound, be desperate for shade and scared out of your wits just observing the land through the eyes of Jaxie Clackton. Fortunately made an orphan by his vicious stepfather, whom he aptly names Captain Wankbag, Jaxie makes a hasty departure for the bush. West is the highway, east is the desert and there's no way he's going to be seen by anybody. He just needs time to sort his shit out and hitch up with his cousin, Lee, the only person he can affectionately say really knows him.Out in the bush he has plenty of time to reflect on life. Reminiscing helps him cope with his dire circumstances. Not one for school he nonetheless excels in bush craft and he knows pretty quickly that finding a water supply and secondly feeding himself are crucial to his survival. If only he had packed a better tool than a butter knife. At least he has his gun and some rounds but how long can he last? A rough hut presents itself and he goes about making it habitable but killing a massive roo presents its own challenges. How can he preserve the meat for later consumption before it rots before his eyes? Perhaps an expedition to the salt lake north of here is the answer. And so Jaxie sets off in search of a solution and gets more than he bargained for. Stones look like people and his canister of water is dry and he's more fearful for his life than ever before when he comes upon another hut, better constructed than his own and inhabited. He spots a water tank to refill from but there's an old man going about his business, talking a dime a dozen, singing to himself and busying himself with all manner of activities. The roasting of a goat smells very appetising and Jaxie is famished but he's not going to reveal his position until the man reveals it for him offering to share his platter with the young man hiding nearby.Jaxie is ropeable. He hasn't moved a stitch yet the old man has spotted him. He could knock him off quick smart with his rifle. He had youth - speed and agility - over this old codger but somehow he doesn't. Their relationship starts with mutual mistrust, relies on it, but settles into mutual respect. Neither reveal the truth of their circumstances but both regularly share the companionship that takes the bite from the extreme loneliness any single man would feel in this vast continent. A perceptive coming-of-age for both Jaxie and an abandoned Irish priest as they survive Australia's harshest terrain.
