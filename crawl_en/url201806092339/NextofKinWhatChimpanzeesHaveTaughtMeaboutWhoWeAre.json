If you are wondering why I only gave it four stars: that is because some would say there is more truth in fiction. As a linguist, I loved reading the way the chimps learn language. Before the project fell apart, chimps were already teaching there young without any outside assistance. I wish that there project would not have fallen apart for two reasons - first, the language development in the animals as future generations learned sign language would have gotten even cooler and second, because reading about tortured chimps is depressing."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/759949-lisa", "userReview": "When I was a little girl and signing as a means of communicating with chimps was covered in documentaries and in the pages of Life and Look and National Geographic as a sort of miracle, I thought that Jane Goodall and her colleagues lived unimaginably charmed lives. At the start of this memoir, one has that same sense: what could be more magical and marvelous than learning how to communicate with animals? Fouts gives you a front and center peek into our closest animal cousins' perspectives and experiences of the world. It dazzles. You begin the memoir thinking that he is the luckiest guy in the world, having, through several twists of fate (described with appealing self-effacement), landed in a particular academic program, which, in turn, leads to life-long work with chimpanzees. After an extended (and very enjoyably described) honeymoon period, he methodically breaks your heart. You learn, alongside the author, about the tortures endured by chimpanzees (both in the wild and within animal research facilities). Ultimately, though, the book is inspiring: the author acts with uncommon decency and is able to use his stature to ensure the safety of a number of chimpanzees in an enduring way, and encourages the reader to become active in efforts to remove chimpanzees from animal testing facilities."}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/724453-matt", "userReview": "This is a powerful, life-changing book. It is a fluid mixture of entertaining narrative, heart-breaking details about the treatment of chimpanzees in laboratories, and engaging discourse about evolutionary theory, the development of language in chimps and humans, etc.Through the entirety of the book & the microcosm of Washoe (the central chimp in the story) the message comes across that these animals are individuals, complete with personalities, moving emotions, and complex thoughts. They show a sense of humor, personal characteristics, and even compassion (such as when Washoe rescues another chimp from drowning). The narrations of the conversations had with the chimps are some of the most powerful aspects of the book: you have a sense of meeting a mind not much different than your own.Fouts humbly highlights his journey from almost-accidental chimp language researcher, to despondent alcoholic, to activist working on behalf of these amazing animals. He highlights a central contradiction in medical research involving chimpanzees: they are studied because they are so similar to humans, yet shouldn't this similarity also cause us to see and respect their personhood? His tours of medical research facilities and the tiny, isolated cages in which chimps are essentially poisoned and tortured, will break your heart. Aptly he uses Shakespeare's quote to warn us against having \"All pity choked by custom of fell deed\" (p. 318).This book will make you laugh, cry, and--above all--think!"}, {"userName": "Lauri", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/437019-lauri", "userReview": "This is one of the most powerful books I've ever read. At once, it is eye-opening, heartwarming, and heartbreaking. I cried and smiled and laughed and cried some more. You'll learn about everything from childhood autism, to the evolution of language, to the fight for the humane treatment of lab animals. This book is flawlessly constructed and flows effortlessly from start to finish, making it a book that I couldn't put down for two days straight. What started out an experiment to teach one chimp how to communicate using sign language, exploded into a phenomonon. The auther dedicated his whole life to humanely working with and protecting these chimps (often times, at the expense of his own personal gain). As a side note, the author and Central Washington State cooperated some years ago to create a permanent home for a handful of the signing chimps.

I never realized just how intelligent chimpanzees really are. I always thought that chimps using ASL were only using 1 or 2 word combinations, and only with nouns. It is amazing the complex sentences, thoughts, and emotions that these \"animals\" are sharing. I'll never look at a chimp the same again.There is an ethical dilemma with using primates for scientific study, or for using any animals for that matter. The author has the extremist view of removing all forms of non-observational animal research. However, he never pushes this view onto the reader, and his reasons for his stance are clear and logical. I may not share the same view for all animals, but I also didn't spend 30 years of my life working with a chimpanzee family that I love."}, {"userName": "Charity", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/424546-charity", "userReview": "Holy moly. This book is awesome.I can't remember how we found this book. I think some website (maybe Goodreads) recommended it because my nine-year-old was reading every single thing Jane Goodall wrote. My daughter read it first, and then as she was getting ready to return it to the library said, \"Mom, I really think you should read this book. It's really good.\"Once I started the book, it didn't take me long to agree with her.I was probably already primed to find this book amazing. Whenever I go to a zoo or an animal sanctuary, I always have mixed feelings, especially when I see the captive primates, whether they're gorillas, chimpanzees, golden lion tamarins, capuchin monkeys, or marmosets. I was reminded of this when my family visited the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., last month and observed the gorillas. I recognize the realities of habitat loss and other aspects of modern life that make it impossible to return many of these beings to the wild, but they're just a little too close for comfort. I empathize with them a little too much to make watching them in captivity completely comfortable.Reading Fouts' book emphasized all of these feelings I was already having. It was a very emotional read.In this book, Fouts (with Stephen Tukel Mills) addresses issues of language acquisition, how learning happens (especially the use of rewards and punishments in learning), the close evolutionary relationship between chimpanzees and humans, the bias of the speaking/hearing population for spoken language, the morality of using non-human animals for biomedical testing, and the arbitrary boundaries we use to define \"human\" and \"non-human.\" While imparting all of this information, the book reads like a memoir---a very compelling memoir.Near the end, I started asking \"where are they now?\" about the chimpanzees in the book, which Fouts wrote in 1997. After an internet search, I learned that Dar, Moja, and Washoe have since died, and that Tatu and Loulis are now living at Fauna Foundation in Quebec, only a few hours' drive from where we live now. My daughter and I are now looking at the adopt-a-chimp and membership options at the foundation, and wondering if we can swing a visit. I also began reviewing all of my household purchases. I lean towards products not tested on animals anyway, but sometimes---I admit---I am swayed by a good price. There are a surprising number of products in my house that wouldn't make the cut if I were really serious about avoiding products tested on animals.So basically, this was a compelling and poignant read that has compelled me to make some changes in my everyday life. I'm now thinking of buying this for a half-dozen people for Christmas. Although since they're all primates, maybe they'd appreciate dress-up clothes and a bouquet of bananas more.Here are some of my favorite quotes from the book:\"Once triggered, learning will not stop---unless it is hijacked by conditioning.\" (83)\"Creativity and learning are examples of innate behavior that can only be hindered, not helped, by rewards.\" (84)Of a baby chimpanzee: \"Until she grasps her groups' specific gestures and social cues---its dialect---she won't be able to learn important skills from her mother, form alliances with her peers, attract a mate, and raise her own children.\" (87)\"If our ape ancestors communicated gesturally, were early man's first languages signed? If so, how and when did these signed languages become spoken?\" (90)\"In fact, during the first half of this [the twentieth] century, educators tried mightily to eradicate American Sign Language because they thought its gestures were too monkeylike\"; speech was seen as the 'higher and finer part' of language.\" (96)\"Science that dissociates itself from the pain of others soon becomes monstrous.\" (372)\"Some scientists love to measure an animal's mind by comparing it to the human I.Q. In these tests chimpanzees come off like mentally disabled children or adults. But when we are dropped in the jungle, we suddenly test like mentally disabled chimpanzees, and the chimpanzees look like certified geniuses.\" (376)"}, {"userName": "Megan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4226508-megan", "userReview": "It was Washoe who taught me that \"human\" is only an adjective that describes \"being\", and that the essence of who I am is not my humanness but my beingness.

At times charming, funny, eye-opening, and devastatingly heartbreaking, Roger Fouts describes his research on communicating with chimpanzees using sign language.

This is an amazing book, the engrossing story of primatologist Roger Fouts and the several chimps, including the famous Washoe, to whom he taught American Sign Language. I'm sure I'd have enjoyed reading it, but oh man, the audio is so, so good. Fouts narrates. As is often the case when a book is narrated by its author, it doesn't sound as though he's reading a book to you, but rather as though he's talking to you. Besides, there are sound effects. Fouts was a dedicated teacher and friend to several chimps. His story is tender, insightful, and passionate. Both heartwarming and heartbreaking. Fouts reveals the dark side of some of the animal research carried out in the latter decades of the last century, the inhumane treatment of the animals, and his path from researcher to animal rights advocate.

A must read for anyone interested in human and animal welfare. I haven't been so emotionally affected by a book since \"the only kayak.\" p. 88 \"I often found myself in heated exchanges with Washoe that reminded me of my own childhood. For ex., in early 1969, I had the thankless job of keeping her in the garage on laundry day while Susan Nichols used the washer in the Gardner's home to clean Washoe's clothes. Before, whenever Washoe had seen us gathering up her clothes, she'd know that the Gardner's backdoor would soon be open and she could sneak inside, where she would launch a chimp style raid: emptying the fridge, romping through the beds, and ransacking the closets. I always wound up frantically chasing her around the house. One time I turned on the vacuum cleaner to scare her out. This worked a little too well. in her panic to escape, she began defecating all across the Gardner's Persian rug. The new laundry day strategy had me luring Washoe away from the trailer by suggesting that we GO GARAGE PLAY before Susan gathered up the dirty clothes. Washoe was usually enthusiastic about this b/c we had fixed up th garage as a rainy day playroom. We painted jungle scenes on the walls and put in a mattress for Washoe to bounce on, a parachute to swing on, and rugs to roll in. It was big enough for her to ride her tricycle around or to have wagon rides in. Once we were inside I would surreptitiously paddock the door.This worked fine until Washoe looked out the window and saw Susan on her way to the Gardner's with the laundry. Then the garage became a prison and I was the big, bad brother. First she asked GO OUT. When I refused she signed, OPEN KEY, just in case I had forgotten how to get out. She even resorted to her most polite PLEASE OPEN. When I signed my refusal, she first began tickling me, then pinching and scratching, and finally tearing my shirt off. I was bigger than Washoe, but nowhere near as strong. I had to do something fast of these games would turn into major brother sister brawls. It was during one of these brawls that I remembered a trick my older brother played on me when they wanted to keep me from going into a forbidden room. They would tell me that the \"bogeyman\" was in that room and he would \"get me if I went inside.\" There was no question that Washoe's bogeyman was big black dogs so I pointed to the locked garage door and signed BIG BLACK DOG OUT THERE. EAT LITTLE CHIMPANZEE. Right away Washoe's eyes got big and her hair stood on end. She stood up on two legs and began swaggering like one angry ape. She hammered on the wall with the back of her hand. Then, suddenly, she charged across the garage, leaping into the air at the last moment and slammed into the locked door with both feet. Then she came back over to me. This was working better than I had ever imagined. Washoe had ripped so many of my shirts on laundry day that I decided it was time to even the score a little. I asked her, YOU WANT GO OUT AND PLAY WITH BLACK DOG? She retreated to the farthest corner of the garage.These exchanges went considerably beyond the kind of non-verbal communication one can have with a chimpanzee using facial expression and body language, or with a dog through barks and single word commands. Washoe and I were communicating. Symbolically she gave me symbolic information - telling me to open the door and suggesting that I unlock it using the key. I responded with symbolic information, false though it way, about the big black dog. If I hadn't been able to conjure up a non-existent dog, and if Washoe hadn't been able to comprehend it, I might not have been able to defuse our conflict. My soon might have been acquiring English faster and more comprehensively than Washoe was acquiring American Sign Language, but they were both using language to communicate abstractly and effectively. For me, this was the most powerful evidence supporting Darwin's theory that human language emerged from our ape-like ancestor.\""}, {"userName": "Ariel", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4940999-ariel", "userReview": "[ The book documents horrifying experiments conducted on chimpanzees, many kept in solitary confinement for years on end, in small metal boxes, with no stimulation. Chimpanzees are our closest evolutionary relatives, and like us, are social animals. In the wild they range wildly through the forests, leaping from tree to tree. The result of their confinement was mental illness, stereotypies, and conditions like catatonia. What Roger and Jane Goodall witnessed together in these labs tempered their resolve to speak out about ending cruel and isolating biomedical research on chimpanzees, and eventually research all together. The heartwarming part of the book includes wonderful tales about Washoe's adopted family, and her journey from stolen child to matriarch. My personal favorite chimpanzee from the five Roger, his wife, and many students were able to bring to live with Washoe was Tatu. Tatu loves the color black, including black lipstick, and was a great timekeeper, remembering each holiday in order. She also cleaned up after her chimpanzee family by choice, carrying their bowls to humans waiting to retrieve them.

How and when did our hominid ancestors acquire language? Do chimpanzees - who are genetically closer to humans than they are to other apes - have language abilities? Is sign language useful where other communication channels fail, for example in children with autism? Next of Kin addresses these and other questions through the story of a young female chimpanzee who was taught American Sign Language in the 1960s. Roger Fouts was assigned to Project Washoe, an initiative of Dr. Allen Gardner to raise a chimpanzee as a human child and communicate only through sign language (everyone who worked with Washoe had to take a vow of silence) and his observations are recorded in this book.Fouts argues that it is a mistake to equate language with speech, that speech and the communication through gestures require the same cognitive basis for language in the brain, and that primates have had language capabilities for millions of years.His experiences with Washoe - carefully recorded and scientifically tested - proved Chomsky and Descartes wrong and Darwin right: the use of language is not unique to humankind.

I think Dr. Fouts' greatest comments are those about scientists and how they conduct their science. It made me reflect on the kind of scientist I want to be and about the fights worth fighting.

That sounds terrible, but we lived on a farm and we were overrun with unwanted litters of kittens. But much worse is the situation in Fouts' book where hundreds, if not thousands, of chimpanzees were caged and subjected to all kinds of medical experiments, many of them cruel, literally a fate worse than death. Until relatively recently, chimpanzees were regarded as wild animals who had little in common with humans, and could be used for research, much as rats and mice are used. .What Fouts has done in this book is to demonstrate that chimpanzees are anything but animals Their dna is closer to humans than to any other animal. They're intelligent creatures who use language to communicate. And not just any mechanistic response to behaviorist rewards and punishment approach, but language as a broadly social activity. True, it's not a spoken language, but Fouts worked with chimpanzees and was able to teach them American sign language used by deaf people to go with their instinctive use of signs. It is as complex in its way as spoken language. They're sensitive, capable of humor found, for example, in jokes and teasing and lead lives of social interaction, just as humans do. Chimpanzees received a lot of publicity in the early space program and were initially launched into space, trained to take the place of humans. But as the space program developed, they were discarded and mostly become the objects of clinical research. They were viewed as \"objects\" and could be subjected to any kind of testing, no matter how brutal or cruel. But there were a few researchers who were raising young chimps in human family settings to see what their capabilities were, and it was one of these studies that initially Fouts, with a background in child psychology, that led to his lifelong commitment to chimpanzees and their well-being.The book is really made up of two parts, one describing his work with a number of chimpanzees, all named as they have distinct personalities, and the other describing his conflicts with researchers who refused to see them as any more than just dumb creatures to experiment on, usually tests for disease control. That meant being locked in small cages and dealt with by technicians. The rationale for this treatment was that if chimp research benefited even one human being then it was worthwhile. By those standards, Nazi scientists could justify laboratory research on feeble-minded individuals. People judged only by their utility to society means a lot of us, including the elderly, the infirm, and the mentally handicapped, would be lacking any worth and lost would be any intrinsic value we have as individuals and human beings. As for animals, Fouts doesn't have answers but does raise questions about how we treat all animals, not just chimps, but the ones that we have either killed or put into captivity, for either research or our own amusement, as in zoos. He is impressed with Jane Goodall and her work with chimpanzees in the African wilderness, but his primary concern is with the many chimpanzees who are already in this country, interacting with human beings in one form or another. He'd argue that the animals he knows best, chimpanzees, have basic rights, just as human beings do. Research using animals may be necessary, but it has to be done humanely and with compassion.

It was a superb introduction to what I was about to witness, and I ended up using a lengthy quote from the book as an epigram to my article about the sanctuary. Fouts has given an incredible and heart wrenching insight into a world we too often choose to ignore - the world side by side to our own \"civilized\" one, the world of the animal kingdom. It is, perhaps, our view of it as a separate world from our own that first gets us into trouble. The human being is an arrogant being. We like to think that we are the superior beast - the thinking, feeling, building, progressive being that rules the earth - but so often the human being is not so superior at all, but only... a beast. Fouts takes that arrogance down several notches. He reveals the remarkable intelligence of the chimpanzee mind. He reveals the astounding emotional depth of the chimpanzee heart. He unveils the tragic suffering of the chimpanzee life when we forget these emotional and intellectual capacities. In a time when scientific strides in all fields - space exploration, medical, or other - can easily be made without the torment of our animal brethren, this book bears witness to our human cruelty and argues effectively for an abandonment of such treatment forever. We are not, after all, a superior creature on this planet.

On multiple occasions, he references that once upon a time, people of color and women were not considered people, but that such views are now considered unthinkable--hence, he imagines a future where to relegate chimpanzees to the status of object and not subject would be considered similarly unthinkable. It is... an experience to read this part of the argument in 2014, when anti-Black racism is institutionalized to the point where legal institutions are causing more deaths in the African-American community than lynchings in the early 1900s and women who create public feminist work and research receive death threats for having done so. Fouts' ignorance of the fact that lots of people still aren't allowed to be people undermined the text to some degree.Scientists are human, too, a revelation which says much about my assumptions/expectations. The rest of Fouts' argument is beautifully drafted, making clear and complex scientific research accessible to a non-industry reader. The more conventionally memoir sections were an absolute joy to read; I all but forced friends and family to listen to me retell stories of Lucy's and Washoe's personalities and lives on several occasions. The book is also in part a memoir of the conversion of an academic into an activist, the telling of which is done very frankly with regards to how that changes the meaning of a \"career.\" I recommend this book to anyone who has ever cared about the biosphere, the biomedical industry, or made a connection with a non-human animal."}, {"userName": "Jethro Tai", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50383426-jethro-tai", "userReview": "'Next of Kin: My Conversations with Chimpanzees' isn't just a book for anyone who wants to learn about chimpanzees, language, and evolution. It's perfect for anyone who simply wants to read a good story. And, for that, I'm not ashamed to admit I've lost count of how many times I cried. This book is a very rare combination of good science and excellent storytelling. It goes beyond informing its readers, which is what we usually expect from science non-fiction. There isn't a moment that feels dry or cold. On the contrary, it moved me more often than many novels did. In this life-changing story about Roger, a compassionate primatologist trying to protect Washoe's family of chimpanzees who had acquired language, you will find yourself alternately laughing and heartbroken. Ultimately, it's a timeless lesson about the importance of love and compassion for all living things, an important message made even more relevant in our current political climate. It raises the question - if we readily objectify or demonize fellow humans who don't look or think like we do, how will we ever be able to extend our compassion to other species? If you have any feelings at all, this book will touch your heart."}, {"userName": "Don", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4722031-don", "userReview": "If you've ever stood by the chimpanzee pen at your favorite zoo trying to communicate with those on the other side of the glass, you'll love the tales by Roger Fouts of care-taking young chimp Washoe, teaching her American Sign Language, and drawing the linguistic, psychological, and ethical implications drawn from a lifetime of providing for her and the family of other chimps that came to surround her. There is lots of love and humor spread throughout the book watching the chimps and humans learn how to live together. Who can trick whom into doing what, in the interests of science, access to food, or just plain play? A quite different aspect of the tale emerges all too quickly - the reality of human treatment of chimpanzees in America while using them to explore space, study diseases, and test medicines. In contrast to the conditions in which Washoe spent most of her life, Fouts provides explicit descriptions of the all-too-cruel conditions under which hundreds of others spent theirs at the hands of American government, university, and business teams. Next of Kin builds a strong argument for examining and re-shaping the conditions within which we allow the kinds of uses of animals, in general, and chimpanzees, in particular, in our search to better our own lives."}, {"userName": "Samrat Sen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25878107-samrat-sen", "userReview": "Ok let me start by saying iam NOT a book worm. I read Non-fiction only that also very selectively.I always wanted to know more about the great apes . Thankfully i came across a recommendation in Goodreads for the 'Next of Kin' by Dr. Fouts.Dr. Roger Fouts has written a phenomenal book! This book is quite the life changer and it will satisfy you if you are want to know more or increase your knowledge on this particular subject. This 400+ book is a long slow read. You cant rush through it like a racy thriller but take it slow and LIVE it like its an experience!Being a slow reader to took me a long time to finish this. But i enjoyed every bit. The warmth, the heartbreaks, the humour, the sadness the journey..everything was superb right till the end. You feel you are apart of the Fouts family as Dr. Fouts takes you along right from the days he started to the very end. Its a beautiful book. I highly recommend the same."}], "description": "Roger Fouts fulfilled humankind's age-old dream of talking to animals by pioneering communication with chimpanzees through sign language. His decades of groundbreaking work with these amazing animals - who share more than 98 percent of our DNA - made scientific history as their unprecedented dialogues opened a window into chimpanzee consciousness and the origins of human language and intelligence. Now, in Next of Kin, Fouts tells the dramatic story of his personal and professional odyssey from novice researcher to celebrity scientist to impassioned crusader for the rights of animals. At the heart of this captivating book is Fouts's magical thirty-year friendship with Washoe, whom we watch grow from a mischievous baby chimp fresh out of the NASA space program into the matriarch of a clan of chimpanzees who fill these pages with tales of humor and heartbreak, pathos and love. Living and conversing with these sensitive creatures has given Fouts a profound appreciation of how much we share with our closest biological relatives, and what they can teach us about ourselves. Fouts also describes the crisis of conscience he faced when he discovered that hundreds of chimpanzees were being subjected to perilous biomedical experimentation in laboratories across America. At significant risk to his own career, he became an outspoken advocate for improved conditions for animals in research labs, and devoted himself to rescuing this lost generation of chimpanzees.", "title": "Next of Kin: What Chimpanzees Have Taught Me about Who We Are", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1139830.Next_of_Kin", "average": 4.44, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1181338134l/1139830.jpg", "reviews": 167, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/104554.Roger_Fouts", "name": "Roger Fouts"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/104553.Stephen_Tukel_Mills", "name": "Stephen Tukel Mills"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Science", "Animals", "Anthropology", "Psychology"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1139830.Next_of_Kin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/325779.Next_of_Kin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6983836-next-of-kin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1139928.Next_of_Kin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/673625.The_Great_Ape_Project_Census", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
