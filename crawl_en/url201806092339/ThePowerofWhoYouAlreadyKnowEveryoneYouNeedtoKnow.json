Despite being several years old and targeted to the business crowd, there are still lots of takeaways for everyone else. The writing style is approachable and conversational and the author draws on lots of personal stories from his experience to illustrate ideas. At its core it's a book about figuring out what you really want to do, how to achieve it and how to build a core group of people who can help you do it. Includes lots of tips on making a good impression in interviews as well. Not too long and very readable. Recommend for graduates, anyone looking to build their network and anyone wanting to do what they love."}, {"userName": "Scott Wozniak", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5185619-scott-wozniak", "userReview": "This is a solid book about how to identify who is your inner circle and how to work with them to help each other succeed. It challenges us to stop networking and build real friendships, that you can't do that with lots of people but you don't need to--your \"few\" are enough.It's a good book. But it's not very specific on how to get into a new field that you don't already have connections into, so if your inner circle isn't connected where you want to go, this book isn't helpful. That's a huge enough gap that I dinged it a couple of stars.

As I read, I found that I already live my life much in the way he describes, without the specific labels that he designates.

You can discover and define the circles in your 18Who 19 world: Fans, Acquaintances, Advocates, Allies, your 18Who 19 Friends and your Inner Circle. Then discover how these connections can be instrumental in helping you reach your goals.3. You can learn how to cultivate, multiply and invest in your 18Who 19 world in order to market yourself better than ever.This book was great for answering the question of whether or not your local, traditional networking is paying off. The author states, 1CTake everything you have ever heard or learned about networking and just throw it out 26 Networking as we know it is crap. It doesn 19t work! 1D That 19s an interesting and bold statement to make, so if you think you might agree or you 19ve frequently thought about marketing yourself differently, then pick up this book and take a look.

You already know all the people who are going to help you accomplish your personal dream whether that includes a new job or not. People help people that they know. Mr. Beaudine is a man who places executives for a career, therefore, most of his examples are in the job obtaining category but his knowledge overlaps into any area where you have a dream. I must admit that for the first couple of chapters I felt like I was in Whoville with Dr. Seuss, Mr. Beaudine does use the \"Who\" factor a lot but once I was used to it, the annoyance disappeared. He uses many illustrations that make perfect sense like the character of Jimmy Stewart in \"Its a Wonderful LIfe\" who ended up asking his enemy for advice rather than his friends. Or the person who used a reference in a resume who mis-pronounced his name when called. Not exactly a \"good\" reference. His statement that \"Everyone has a \"WHO\" network, a community of friends\" really sums up the theme and he expands on this theme throughout the whole book. I found that this book had some really good information for someone who was wanting to find a new position or look for ways in which to accomplish their dreams. Information on a source that is often overlooked by everyone. 4 stars"}, {"userName": "Shaun", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1031189-shaun", "userReview": "This is a motivational book and it motivated and inspired me. The author is a recruiter in the sprots and entertainment industry and is highly successful. This is a book about self-improvement and networking. The author shares a key point about networking, and that is that you already know who you need to know to help you network to reach your career goals and dreams. He tells you to throw away all you've heard up to now about networking. You need to network with your \"Who\" group or those people who truly know and love you. They will want to help you reach your goals and dreams unlike a stranger who you networked with on a bus or at a career fair. He's big on creating \"The 40 List\", which is a list of goals, dreams and aspirations, kind of like a bucket list. He says this list should be changed and updated frequently as you accomplish things and as you develop new goals, dreams and aspirations. I gained some excellent wisdom and insights through reading this book and I plan to read this book again for further motivation and inspiration."}, {"userName": "Khalid", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2848781-khalid", "userReview": "Bob Beaudine believes \u201cNetworking\u201d is an importuned factor neglegted in the American workplace.

The premise of the book is a simple one...you already know everyone that you need to know in order to achieve your dreams. Whether it is finding a new job, linking up with someone who can help you start your own business or someone that can provide you with expert advice in how to run your life...you already know someone that knows someone that can help you. A fairly quick read, but contains very valuable advice. The chapter about your Personal Board of Directors was pretty eye opening and probably worth the price of the book. Beaudine also does a good job of reminding us how powerful lists can be in our life. Overall, highly recommended for anyone that is looking to make a change in their life and is going to need the help of others to accomplish it."}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2542657-stephanie", "userReview": "If you are job hunting, know exactly what you want to do, thinking about making a change in your career, or are not specific about what you want to do- read this.

Beaudine's experience in executive search has revealed most people under utilize personal connections- we tend to network with total strangers rather than ask a friend for help.

This book is a motivator. It helps you begin to think of th people you already know in a different way. I have to agree with most everything Bob wrote - people are willing to help you if they know what you are trying to do and they already know and like you. I agree, spend more time focusing on people with whom you already have connections with than trying to meet more people for the sake of knowing more people. Much of what is written is Biblically based as well. The ancedotes used were nice to read too.

More importantly Beaudine explains how the Who you know is a key part of getting to the goal.

A good deal of touchy feely type stuff that reminds me of that SNL spoof....\"you're good, you're smart and dog-gone-it people like you\" However, with that sugary encouragement aside it is a helpful book."}, {"userName": "Rick", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7213786-rick", "userReview": "There's a better way than going to events and \"networking\" with people who only care about what they can get. You already have people in your corner. I thought Bob's message was a little trite at first, but he's right. Even if you don't have a vested relationship with one who can directly open a door, they might know a person who can and will because your friend will be a genuine advocate. Bob gives great advice about interviewing and even finding a spouse. One of the best career (and life) books I've ever read.

I liked it because it is more my style of networking which feels more genuine and is more about building relationships and friendships rather than schmoozing or using the other, to borrow from another book, \"personality ethic\". I'm all about the character ethic and the sincerity that comes from having a relationship that can lead to an opportunity because of people caring about each other.

People intrinsically want to help other people and if you don't tell your friends and acquaintances (Who) the things that you want to do (What), then you are depriving them of an opportunity to assist you in reaching your goals and living your dreams. Just mentioning what you hope and dream of, without specifically asking for anything, can open doors for you by connecting you with either like minded folks or people who can actually further your progress.
