Audrey's dad got killed in the Korean War and her mother is an alcoholic; Caroline is an ugly girl born to beautiful parents and oh, one day her dad (who was Audrey's dad's best friend) kills her mother because her mother laughs with a friend who's leaving her husband and he's upset she sympathizes. Caroline and Audrey get older and Audrey goes to play piano at the aforementioned Apollo Theater, leaving Caroline who also dreams of being a star but never makes it out of rural Kentucky. Audrey falls in love with and marries one of her bandmates, but all their compatibility is in music and after they lose their job at the theater and move back down South, eventually they aren't really compatible in anything. She ends up finding out he never loved her. So Audrey moves back home, completely broken, and ends up talking to Caroline's father who's out of jail about how he loved the wife he killed, and then AUDREY FALLS IN LOVE WITH HIM. The last chapter is very vague, but it implies that they live together and are married with a child.First of all, your best friend's father. Second of all, your best friend's father who straight up murdered his first wife. I get that Audrey is damaged and has a perverted view of love and that her choice makes sense in that way, but Audrey is also smart, and I am not buying that a smart person would push both \"he is my best friend's father\" and \"he killed my best friend's mother and chopped her into pieces and hid her around the house, including putting her head in the chimney so she could look down on her girls wtf wtf wtf\" out of the brain pan that filters possible relationship choices and into the funnel to the heart. I mean, I can see her learning lessons from his life and feeling close to him for being her father's friend and her friend's father, but it's hard to get over murder.

Her best friend, Caroline Wallace, daydreams about Hollywood stardom, but both girls feel destined to languish in a slow-moving stopover town in Montgomery County.My reactions:I\u2019m about a generation behind these girls, but I was interested in a story set in the late 1950s \u2013 an era when I was first becoming acutely aware of popular music and could hardly wait to grow up and join my cousins dancing to Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry and Fats Domino records. Audrey and Caroline are in a similar hurry to grow up, to be done with school, and to go out into the world. They desperately want something MORE out of their lives than small town Mt Sterling, KY can give them. When the book opens Audrey is reeling from the death of her father, in the Korean War. She and her mother live with her Grandpap, who adored his son, and who encourages Audrey to play the piano like her Daddy used to do. Her mother, lost in grief, tries to find solace in a bottle of bourbon. Caroline\u2019s family is still intact; her father, Sonnyboy, has a steady job \u201cdown to the ice plant,\u201d while her mother, Mauris, does alterations in the back room of the local department store. But both girls are loners. Neither one deemed pretty or popular, they stick together until \u2026.Townsend has the two girls take turns narrating, so that several chapters are told from Audrey\u2019s point of view, followed by several chapters from Caroline\u2019s point of view, then back to Audrey, etc. In this way, the reader gets more of the story than either of the girls, who go long stretches without talking to one another, despite their very close friendship as children. I remember the pain when my best childhood friend seemed suddenly to have \u201coutgrown\u201d me; when our interests diverged and we were no longer exclusively one another\u2019s confidante. My heart broke for both Audrey and Caroline as I witnessed their growing pains. Despite being able to connect with these characters, at least in theory, I found this a very slow read. It took me 12 days to read the book. I did NOT dislike it, but it just never really captured my attention. Still, Townsend is a talented writer, and some of the scenes she paints are very vivid.

But as I started reading more about Caroline and Audrey I couldn't put it down. Caroline and Audrey are two young Black girls growing up poor in Kentucky. They call themselves friends. But, their friendship is really based on loss. Audrey's father dies in the war. Caroline's mother is killed by her father. They are very different. Caroline is reckless. She has the responsibility of taking care of her young sister and her grandmother after her father murders her mother. Audrey is quiet, reads a lot. She learns to play the piano by ear. The book goes from Audrey to Caroline's voices. It takes us from Kentucky to Harlem. We hear names like Count Basie and Thelonius Monk. Audrey's talent takes her away from Kentucky right when she needs it to. The book was very colorfully written. I could imagine the Jim Crow era as it was. The characters came to life. My only complaint is when \"bookish\" characters like Audrey are painted like they have no backbone and no common sense. Other than that, Saint Monkey surprised me.

It's a wonderful thing to experience. Ms. Townsend has burst onto this scene with a crafty literary novel for her maiden voyage. Essentially a coming of age story focused on the lives of Audrey and Caroline aka Pookie. The novel takes turns alternating between these two voices. Despite starting the girls' narrative at an early age the skillful writing helps to avoid that young adult feel. Her writing is engaging and she has some memorable phrases sprinkled throughout the novel. \"The whole world might not be broken, but the right way in it was.\"The girls are reared in a small Kentucky town and are united by proximity and tragedy. One incident that impacted Caroline was of such a heinous nature that her ability to soldier on was only because of the superior writing abilities of Ms. Townsend. I can't remember a crime of that nature in any recent past reads. The author however handles this evil doing so deftly, that although you are reading it and understand its' gruesomeness, it is not written in a gory, graphic manner, so she manages to keep the story moving right through this event. That's fantabulous! Audrey has also suffered a misfortune and attempts to create a closer bond with Pookie with tragedy as the bridge. Pookie however rejects this notion and a lifetime of resentment is built. As the girls grow, their lives take divergent paths, with Audrey moving to the big apple NYC while Caroline is left behind in small town Kentucky, with Hollywood dreams never realized. Audrey writes frequently to Caroline keeping her updated on experiences from NYC but most of these letters go unanswered. She is just wanting for Caroline to share in her success, but Caroline doesn't receive it that way. When Audrey returns to Kentucky everything is brought full circle and the energy between Audrey and Caroline is clumsy, but was it ever anything else? You will have to read this one to make that determination. It will be a fun and zesty literary ride."}, {"userName": "stacia", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56750-stacia", "userReview": "It took me longer than it should've to get through this novel and I skimmed full sections of it after awhile, but I also admire the relationship at the core of it. Caroline and Audrey's friendship feels fairly toxic but the venom that seems to course between them after a time wouldn't be potent if they'd never known a deep love for one another. The book resembles Sula in that way, except Caroline and Audrey's abandonments and betrayals if one another seem far more drastic and are never forgiven. Though it's interesting watching their lives unfurl in different directions, and I liked the shifting narrative voices when they emerged, it was hard to know which character should have my allegiance. They're both endearing and insufferable -- and I guess that's the point. But it got tedious for me, as did long passages of description and time spent in characters I couldn't possible care less about (particularly in the third act). It's a difficult book for a few reasons, but it's beautifully written overall. (Those long passages descriptive passages and internal monologue are quite lovely at turns.)"}, {"userName": "Pamela", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20048096-pamela", "userReview": "At a different time, distant from Thanksgiving and Christmas, I might have enjoyed reading this colorful story, of two young girls/women thrashing their way through grief, hormones, poverty, and racism. The writing is often beautifully poetic; in a abstract, gritty sort of way. Atmosphere, characterization, and volatility of time and place are boldly and honestly portrayed. The turnoff for me, like bitter dregs of coffee, was the relationship between Audrey and Caroline. I hesitate to use the word 'friends' because my definition of friendship doesn't include: animosity, conniving spitefulness, vengeful jealously, and/or vicious backstabbing. Dysfunction is one thing - but these girls are CAUSTIC! Then again, perhaps turbulent caustic-dysfunction is a character in and of itself, and more the point to the story than the story. If that makes any sense???? Somewhat like, the river of rage in the land of bitter. Perhaps at another time I'll revisit this book and have a different perspective.

I never quite understood the bond between Caroline and Audrey. Wasn't clear to me how their childhood created a bond, as I was lead to believe by reading the dust cover.

The beginning of the story dragged on too long and the end was too abrupt. I was left feeling - nothing for either Caroline or Audrey and that was a disappointment.

Shifting points of view has become an often tired literary technique, but Townsend plays Audrey's and Caroline's voices against one another to surprising effect.

Caroline tries visiting Audrey and still hopes to break out of her small town life but ends up selling cosmetics to the other women in her community and continuing the same back road existence she's always lived.

I have no idea how it was published. It has lots of scene but no plot. It reads like a nostalgic reunion of events years after they occurred. \"You remember the time...\" The snippets of memories never come into a story and the book doesn't have a real beginning, middle, and end. It all stays superficial without diving into emotion and meaning. It could be worked into 2-3 novels if any one thought were developed. I was drawn to read about friendships but the two characters were living parallel to one another more like acquaintances and I wouldn't have called the relationship a friendship. The author seemed to have jammed all the notes she was collecting of phrases to use for a later book and I doubt she has anything left. The most distracting thing is that she kept going into and out of dialect - within the same sentence!!!! Either the character does or does not speak in dialect.

Never have I ever been so excited to finish a book and not in a good way. This book took entirely too long to get going and to read. By the end I hated both of the characters. I think this book spent way too much time in exposition and I kept waiting for something to happen for the story to actually get moving and it didn't really take off. I think this could've been told just from the view of Audrey because once she (finally) gets to NYC it mostly becomes about her and this was the most interesting part in my opinion. I feel that there were things that were focused on too heavily, like the expo which was a slog, but then not enough attention paid to other things, like where did August go? Clearly August's mother played a big role, even from a far, but we get no insight into that - why even introduce her at all? It has never taken me so long to read a novel but I know that part of the reason it took so long was because it was slow and uninteresting. I only finished this book because I had already started and was initially trying to give it a good faith effort, but it was work.

The opening paragraphs are enough to make you realize that she can tell several interlocking stories with just a few words. Her style is so lyrical and evocative that it doesn\u2019t matter that she occasionally leaves a few plot details to your imagination. This novel is set in the late fifties, and it\u2019s the story of two young Black women in a small Kentucky town. Audrey is skinny and bookish with thick glasses, and she has an unrestrained love for her taller and more beautiful friend Caroline, who dreams of leaving town and becoming a film star. Both have family tragedies that split their households, and both see themselves as uniquely bereft. But it\u2019s Audrey who is a talented pianist, and who leaves for Harlem, where she ends up playing in the house band at the Apollo. Caroline flirts with love among the town men available to her, while Audrey falls hard for another jazz musician. Audrey is the one who has faith, mostly a faith in the beauty and purity of others, but she is also the one who has the furthest to fall. In a city full of people demanding a certain look and style, she sees Caroline as her private saint, her touchstone of authenticity, but Caroline doesn\u2019t respond to this vision. The novel moves back and forth between the voices of Audrey and Caroline, and each takes up the story where the other leaves off. Audrey\u2019s voice is much clearer in this novel, perhaps because the music of her world fits in so well with the music of the author\u2019s prose. And this structure doesn\u2019t always work seamlessly. It can mean that some of the story gets lost occasionally, because the two women are often far separated from each other, emotionally as well as geographically. When we return to the story of Audrey, for example, we feel very distanced from her, having seen her through Caroline\u2019s eyes, and we\u2019re not always entirely sure how she got to her current situation. In spite of these small flaws, I would recommend this book to anyone who loves good writing."}, {"userName": "Weston High School Library", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11597853-weston-high-school-library", "userReview": "I'm going to take a risk here and predict that Saint Monkey will become a classic.

Pookie will go to Hollywood. Audrey is afraid she doesn't have the guts to do it herself. The story is told in their voices, in alternating chapters. They are both unreliable narrators, so readers have to fill in the blanks and wonder why the girls tell their stories the way they do. I often thought about who was more alone, who was more loved, who loved best, who knew themselves the most.Audrey \"escapes\" and gets a job at the Apollo Theatre in Harlem playing piano, while Pookie is left back home to wonder why Audrey \"made it\" and not her. I won't tell you any more than that because I don't want to spoil a plot with lots of satisfying twists and turns. These twists and turns are more than entertainment--they are are symbolic and emotional manifestations of Saint Monkey's themes of love and self knowledge.Saint Monkey is set in the Civil Rights Era, and lots of important events are worked into the plot. Readers will gain a deeper knowledge and a painful understanding of African Americans and whites who lived through those times as well as those who came before them. The book is slow to start and Townsend throws a lot of characters at you, fast. Don't worry if you can't keep them straight! Just keep going. By the third chapter you'll know everyone.
