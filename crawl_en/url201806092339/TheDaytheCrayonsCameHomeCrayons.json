My name is MAROON CRAYON. You only colored with me once, to draw a scab, but whatever. Anyway, you LOST me TWO years ago in the couch, then your dad SAT on me and BROKE ME IN HALF! I never would have survived had PAPERclip not NURSED me back to health. I'm finally better, so come get me! And can Paper Clip come too? He's really holding me together.Sincerely, Your marooned crayon,Maroon CrayonWe see a bearded Robinson Crusoe-lookin' crayon with a happy waving paper clip wrapped around his waist.Dear Duncan, No one likes peas.No one even likes the color PEA green. So I'm changing my name and running away to see the WORLD.Sincerely, Esteban... the Magnificent!(the crayon formerly known as PEA GREEN)LOL LOL We see Pea Green, oh, excuse me, I mean Esteban the Magnificent putting on his cape and running heroically.http://www.ew.com/sites/default/files...Neon Red is writing from the Ritz Motel where he was left by the pool after Duncan used him to color in his dad's sunburn. After eight months of waiting for Duncan to come get him, he's decided to walk back.Yellow and Orange (as you remember they were fighting about who was the \u201ctrue color of the sun\u201d in Book One) are now fused together in an unholy mutation after being left out in the aforementioned sun.You know the real color of the sun?? HOT. That's what. We're sorry for arguing. You can make Green the sun for all we care, just bring us HOME!Then there's the grosser ones like \u201cTan or Possibly Burnt Sienna\u201d who was eaten by a dog and puked up on the living room rug. It's gross, but kids will probably get a kick out of it.Then we get an update from Estaban the Magnificent:Dearest Duncan,Um... could you please OPEN the FRONT DOOR? I still need to see the world....Sincerely, Esteban the MagnificentOne of the children's favorites might be the glow-in-the-dark page (tantalizingly mentioned on the cover) in which Glow In The Dark Crayon reminisces about when he and Duncan drew scary stuff on the wall to convince Duncan's little brother that there was a ghost under the basement stairs. But now Glow In The Dark Crayon is trapped in the basement and he is scared.We get periodic updates from Neon Crayon who is intensely confused about where he is in the world. For instance, he sends a postcard from Egypt, but claims he's in New Jersey.Gold Crayon's upset because he was blunted coloring in gold coins.Some other crayons write in from various places with various complaints. Just like the ending of the first book, Duncan finds a way to make everyone happy.EL FIN.\u2026PLUSES: - Even funnier than the first book. - Glow-in-the-dark page. - Illustrations that look as if they have been drawn by an actual child. - Good concepts and vocabulary, doesn't talk down to children.MINUSES: - Occasionally gross. One crayon is puked up by a dog, a brown crayon is upset because Duncan used him to color shit. I mean, your personal gross-out level will vary. This won't even faze some people.Tl;dr \u2013 Even funnier than the first book."}, {"userName": "Carol.

Lots of words and a story line that it a little too sophisticated for the pre-eight-year-old set that centers on the calamities that happen to crayons owned by careless young children. The pictures are a great play off kid's crayon drawings, but may not be appreciated by eyes looking for crisp edges and bright colors. The florescent pink crayon reminded me of how I disliked that crayon when I was younger. My four-year-old cousin was bored when I tried reading it to her, but I wasn't!For excerpts and details on the story, see Carmen's excellent review.https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...I too have a fondness for Esteban the Magnificent (formerly known as Pea Green)!"}, {"userName": "David Schaafsma", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/269235-david-schaafsma", "userReview": "I am reading, as I did the last two years, all the November nominees for the Goodreads Children's illustrated book award. Last year I read Daywalt and Jeffers' The Day the Crayons Quit and I really liked it. This is a sequel, and now the crayons are on their way home, preceded by mostly vintage postcards to a kid from various places far and near (the couch, the basement, various foreign countries.. .). As I saw it, it's like one joke extended over a whole book, like the last book, but still, it made me laugh in places, each postcard and each crayon's story is unique and funny in its own way, and the art is good for both parents and children. Kind of ends a little lamely on my opinion, as all the multi-colored crayons are finally back home and get housed together again, we are family, etc. But the kids are liking that ending better than me.But when I read this to ten year old Henry, he thinks I am too harsh: \"Dad! It's funny! It's good. He thinks four stars.\"The whole family will read all these and I will hereafter not make the review until I get all the ratings (and will add final vote for FAVORITE!) from each family member.Fun??! Yep. I have posted on the fridge already the family rating sheet...Dave 3.5 starsTara 4 starsHarry (10) 3.5 starsHenry (9) 5 starsLyra (8) 5 starsSo I decided to bump up my original 3 star rating to a 4 to reflect the family ratings.I should say I rated The Day the Crayons Quit 4 stars last year--it was one of my top five new illustrated books, though I didn't LOVE it, I liked it a lot--and my kids liked it 5 stars."}, {"userName": "Archit Ojha", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54103953-archit-ojha", "userReview": "Winner of the Goodreads Choice Award for Picture Book.

Each colour describes their predicament. Aimed at young children but my 12 yr old instantly picked it up and said it was great and thought I'd taken it out of the library for her to read. Funny and beautifully presented. One minor downside, I hate it when books reinforce negative stereotypes, the green crayon says all children hate peas. The children I know love vegetables and I don't like children being told this.

I thought THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT was fun, but this takes it to a whole new level.

Some were forgotten on vacation, or under couches. Some have melted in the sun, or suffered terrible fates at the hands of household pets.

Like the prequel The Day the Crayons Quit, this was a cute and clever book. My daughter really enjoyed it but stated that she liked the first one better.In this book the less often used crayons are the primary characters, and they send postcards to Duncan to explain where they have been since they went missing. The illustrations are nice. My favorite part of the book was all of the hilarious postcards from Neon Red. The textured page for Glow in the Dark Crayon was also fun.

While it is a completely different book I still love and enjoyed the story and believe it is worth the read!After we reached a happily ever after with the crayons and Duncan, you might think what now? Did Duncan screw up and abuse the crayons again? The answer is yes and no. The crayons we met in the first book is fine but apparently Duncan has ignored the lesser known or used crayons.One day he receives a bunch of letters again and discover that some of the crayons he's barely used in years have come to the surface and either A.) Want to leave him or B.) Wants him to take better care of these crayons.I believe since we've already been introduced to this classic story, it doesn't feel as special and captivating since this book is following the same formula as the first one. But I will admit that the ending is completely different from what you might expect and it goes to show you that the author doesn't want this book to be predictable and while it may be similar to the first one it is still original and will still captivate Children's and Adults.The illustrations are marvelous as always and I hope they make a third book because I cannot get enough of the crayons and the humor of this series. Originally I was going to pick the new Dr. Seuss book for Best Picture Book for Goodreads Awards and because this was such a cute and funny story I voted for this book instead.Would I recommend this book to you? My answer would be yes if you want more stories about these crayons. I applaud the author and illustrator for this fantastic book and I cannot wait to see more Crayon action!"}, {"userName": "Sofia", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8703838-sofia", "userReview": "N\u00e3o pensei que fosse poss\u00edvel repetir o sucesso do \" O dia em que os l\u00e1pis desistiram\", mas estava enganada.Adorei!"}, {"userName": "Elena", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3701038-elena", "userReview": "Dear Duncan,No one likes peas.
