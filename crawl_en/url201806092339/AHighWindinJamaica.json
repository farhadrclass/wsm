I've been dreamily gazing out my window all these long hot summers, yearning for just the novel to fulfill my every need\u2014to take me in its sweet-lovin' arms and say without ever quite saying, 'I'm the one. And I've brought the hot oils and penicillin.' It seems a little cruel, or at least irresponsible, for A High Wind in Jamaica to have hidden in the shadows of literary obscurity for so long, forcing me to waste precious hours of my life reading dreck like V.S. Naipaul and Auster's Brooklyn Follies, but why bemoan the past when in fact we're the lucky ones? Some poor saps read all their lives without meeting their literary soulmates and then die with that nagging dissatisfaction pursuing them to the grave. Not me. I've found Salinger, Proust, Bernhard, Krasznahorkai, Richard Hughes, and the rest. (Okay\u2014so I have a lot of soulmates.) This is my orgy of destiny, and the Do Not Disturb sign is on the doorknob.Just now I said that A High Wind in Jamaica has been hiding 'in the shadows of literary obscurity.' That's not exactly true. It came in at number seventy-one (I believe) on the Modern Library's ridiculous best novels of 20th century list. But still\u2014it doesn't exactly have widespread name recognition like Hemingway, Orwell, or Joyce. It should be just as well-known, of course, but this isn't a fair world. Remember that the Kardashians are celebrities. (That's my current back-to-reality incantation. It quickly counteracts any tendency to expect justice in this world.)A High Wind in Jamaica is a wickedly unsentimental portrait of childhood and the innocence thereof. It is a needful antidote to the prevailing sense that childhood innocence is the equivalent of moral goodness\u2014because it clearly is not. Young children are largely amoral and, as such, are capable of nearly anything. From the vantage of our adult morality, children can seem callous, cruel, and perhaps even evil. This is a misinterpretation, of course, because they as yet lack the signal posts to act in defiance of a proscribed morality. What they are (to a certain extent) is unmoderated expression. This is a little terrifying to us once we've been fully domesticated by society. And Richard Hughes understands this.The story is simple enough. In the 1800s, several children are shipped by their parents from their Jamaican plantations back home to London to avoid the environmental and climatic perils of island life. On the way, their ship is hijacked by pirates and they are unintentionally taken prisoner. Thereafter, they become accomplices of the pirates in their continuing adventures. Hughes embellishes the story with an astonishing gift for imagery and turn of phrase and a knack for the blackest kind of humor. I'm well aware that the vague synopsis above is likely to turn away as many readers as it will woo. Just let me assure you that it isn't what you think, and it's probably like nothing you've ever read. It may not be your literary soulmate, but its uniqueness of tone, vision, and temperament deserves to be read."}, {"userName": "Paul Bryant", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant", "userReview": "It\u2019s like Richard Hughes had never read a novel before writing this one. He has no idea! Let\u2019s break into stage dialogue here. In the middle of some action sequence let\u2019s have a page about children\u2019s games. The shocks here are actually shocking because the prose is so cosy and jolly, all about these kids who grow up in the wilds of Jamaica and then are send by their parents to England to be educated, but their ship is taken by friendly pirates who deliberately don\u2019t have any guns, and who end up being kept like a gaggle of ship\u2019s cats by the friendly pirates who don\u2019t know what the hell to do with them. They say this novel is Peter Pan divided by Lord of the Flies, and that sounds about right. The slapdash extemporised off the cuff fumbling and wambling way Richard Hughes leads us through this very morally dodgy story is delicious. You never know when another bit of casual violence will sandbag you or if he\u2019ll just tell you about three-year-old Laura\u2019s dolls made of bits of rope.I would like to discuss all the queasy moral stuff in detail but that would be Spoiler City so I cannot, my lips are sealed. All the other reviews of this little novel will tell you how very odd it is, and they are so right, and they mark it down and they are so wrong. I loved its oddness. So, in the closing days of 2017, a five star read from 1929. That's the world of books for you.

He is concerned with probabilities. It is the novelist who is concerned with facts, whose job it is to say what a particular man did do on a particular occasion: the lawyer does not, cannot be expected to go further than show what the ordinary man would be most likely to do under presumed circumstances.\"A shortcut I use when thinking about a novel, and it IS a shortcut, is to imagine fitting the book I've just read within a series of other books, or as a color made from mixing several books together. It is childish, rough, and only gets me part of the way there, but it is a start (even if it is an adolescent start). I also, with a book I am unfamiliar with, try to avoid poisoning the well by reading reviews or opinions about it. I want to come to it clean, fresh, to see it for a moment with my own eyes.So? What books did I mix for this one? For me it was a combination of Peter Pan, Heart of Darkness, and Lord of the Flies. Yeah. Wrap your head around that. It was, however, more poetic than any of these. The prose was like a fever dream. Some of the scenes in Jamaica were lush and magical. It was told with colors seen from a child's eyes, events were described through the experience of a child. It wasn't just a trick. Hughes mastered this. He didn't condescend to children. He didn't put them on some victorian pedestal. He measured them by age, by experience, and oriented his story accordingly.The story really is about the loss of innocence (oh, and an earthquake), but as much it is a story about how resilient children are to that loss of innocence (oh, and an alligator). How much children live in the now and wrap that now in myths. Hughes gave the children in this novel the right to be human, to deal with complexity in their own way. I'm still buzzing a bit from how much I really dug this novel. I'm glad I read it and am still surprised I was never exposed to it before."}, {"userName": "Jimmy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1325473-jimmy", "userReview": "This is one of the best books I have ever fucking read. Don't even read this review... Just go read the book already! Then you can come back and read the rest of this review.First of all the subject matter cannot be better: pirates, kids, pigs, monkeys, goats, earthquakes, hurricanes, clue-less adults.Secondly, it's the language, stupid! The language is so fucking great. Hughes sometimes forms the most un-intelligeable sentences with the weirdest fucking words, but string them up in a way that gets across something you wouldn't get with a sensible one.Next, the narrator: he is so funny. He's always coming in at odd times to tell us his opinion, but rarely outright. He's subtle about it.Also, the book is full of surprises. Every other chapter presents a weird twist. But it's not a plot-heavy book, by that I mean it doesn't rely on the plot or the twists to make it good. Considering the 500-pages worth of shit that happens in this 200-page book, it is surprisingly leisurely and pleasantly aimless in its plot, until closer to the end.This book is brilliantly crafted to lull you into one state while shocking you constantly out of it. This book resists to the very end in giving you the sentimentalism you want, in giving in to your pre-conceived ideas of how things should be. And for that it is pure genius.This book is entertaining in that page-turning way, to the highest degree.This book is often laugh out loud funny.This book does not moralize. It is light reading, but also very heavy if you want to read into it. But most of all, it is light. There is no lull in this book.

I use the nautical reference because most of this story is set on or close to the sea. But the story is about children, and how they think, and how they react to events and circumstances beyond their control.

On that the children held their breath, waiting for it to happen. A school of fish, terrified by some purely submarine event, thrust their heads right out of the water, squattering across the bay in an arrowy rush, dashing up sparkling ripples with the tiny heave of their shoulders: yet after each disturbance all was soon like hardest, dark, thick, glass.\u201dIn this novel Richard Hughes undertook a very special journey into the world of children\u2019s consciousness therefore the book is unique.\u201cThey gazed at him in astonishment and disillusion. There is a period in the relations of children with any new grown-up in charge of them, the period between first acquaintance and the first reproof, which can only be compared to the primordial innocence of Eden. Once a reproof has been administered, this can never be recovered again.\u201dAn adult might think that he\u2019s perfectly understood a child but he\u2019s just formed in his mind his own conception that may have nothing to do with child\u2019s thoughts."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65909643-michael", "userReview": "So deliciously strange, I couldn't put it down.

The close call causes the Bas-Thorntons to send their children back to Britain by merchant vessel.

To make a simple thing of my reading of this book, the folks awaiting in Britain, including the Bas-Thorntons and the criminal justice system, misjudge the pirates. One character, the ten year-old Emily, is skillfully drawn.

It was Hughes\u2019 first novel -- he was 29. As it turned out, Hughes was not a prolific writer and is often used as an example when discussing writer\u2019s block. He would go on to write, prior to World War II, a good Conradian sea novel (In Hazard) and then, in 1960, the much later - and admired - Fox in the Attic. Hughes died in 1975. Fox was part of an intended Tolystoyan-like trilogy dealing with events leading up to World War II but, in the end, health problems and Hughes\u2019 own glacier like writing speed (sometimes a few sentences a day) would sink the effort with the final -- and below par -- second entry (The Wooden Shepherd). Thus, Hughes\u2019 reputation seemed headed to the minor writer ash heap. But, in 1999, Modern Library issued its list of the 100 best works of fiction for the past century and lodged in at number 71 was Hughes\u2019 High Wind in Jamaica. As a result, a fine novel has now, to some extent, been resurrected. The book opens on the island of Jamaica, in the early to mid-1800s, introducing readers to the Bas-Thornton children - in particular John and Emily. The setting is Edenic, with the children often going about naked -- being quite comfortable in having gone \u201cnative.\u201d They spend their days swimming, climbing trees, and capturing animals. At one point -- morally telling -- the children muse over the fact that \u201cjiggers\u201d (maggots) are \u201cnot absolutely unpleasant\u201d and there is now a \u201csort of thrill\u201d rubbing the skin (like the natives) where their eggs are laid. Early in the novel, the Bas-Thornton children go to spend a few days with the Fernandez children -- Margaret and Harry. It is during this stay the children witness the first of the two natural disasters that open the novel: an earthquake. Hughes\u2019 particular genius is his ability to see --without sentiment - through the eyes of a child. His description of their reaction to the earthquake, in all its disorienting effects, rings true: But as for Emily, it was too much. The earth quake went completely to her head. She began to dance, hopping laboriously from one foot onto another. John caught the infection. He turned head over heels on the damp sand, over and over in an elliptical course till before he knew it he was in the water, and so giddy as hardly to be able to tell up from down.And so on - with Emily barking like a dog, and John swimming as if going to Cuba. The point here - and throughout the novel - is that from an adult point of view, children are mad. To maintain this psychological high-wire act must be very demanding for a writer. To succeed for the length of a novel is simply a tour-de-force - and Hughes does succeed.The second and more serious disaster is a hurricane. As the hurricane gathers force, the children\u2019s mother (in a surreal scene calling into question adult sanity) attempts to read Walter Scott poems aloud (one senses Hughes\u2019 parodying the stiff upper lip image from days of Victorian literary yore) while all hell is breaking loose outside: natives struggling and drowning in the wind and rain, while the house is literally coming apart. Significantly, it\u2019s during dinner that wild cats enter the house, chasing, and then killing the children\u2019s cat Tabby. This event deeply impacts Emily and she grieves more for Tabby than she does for the various human deaths she encounters along the way. Death will, for her, always wear the face of her beloved cat.For the parents this is the last straw - the house is in ruins and the countryside a wreck. They decide it\u2019s time to ship the children back to England. Coming along with them -- for vague reasons -- are the Fernandez children: young Harry and Margaret, a 13-year old midget. They are taken on board the Clorinda and set to sea. Not long afterward, the ship is taken by pirates - in what has to be one of the more humorous waylayings in literature. The pirates are a sad-sack lot, led by Captain Jonson, a buccaneer in the last days of piracy, who was possibly a former clergyman. He takes the children on board and, for a while, they are accepted as novelties and mascots by the pirates. It is while ashore and disposing of their loot that the adventurous John is lost due to an accident. Violence and tragedy occur without warning in the novel. What\u2019s interesting is how Hughes portrays the children\u2019s reactions when violence occurs. In John\u2019s case - his death is never spoken of. The children continue to play their games on board, but his presence (silently anguished over a bit by Emily) is quickly forgotten.However, the ship is no Peter Pan adventure. There are real-life dangers on board. At one point, after drinking a great deal, the pirates come down into the children\u2019s cabin. The captain is being encouraged by the pirates to apparently rape Emily. But, before anything happens, Emily ends the matter by taking a savage bite out of the captain\u2019s thumb. Later, the captain seems troubled by his behavior - but there will be a complex back and forth between Emily and the captain for the remainder of the novel. It\u2019s as if Emily dangles her awakening sexuality before the captain. More concretely, Margaret starts spending time with the pirates - implicitly suggesting her own sexual involvement with them. The pirates also start treating her with contempt. Emily\u2019s awakening to self involves several remarkable passages in the book. Hughes, as psychologist, takes center-stage: And then an event did occur, to Emily, of considerable importance. She suddenly realized who she was. There is little reason that one can see why it should not have happened to her five years earlier, or even five later; and none, why it should have come that particular afternoon. She had been playing houses in a nook right in the bows, behind the windlass (on which she had hung a devil\u2019s-claw as a door-knocker); and tiring of it was walking rather aimlessly aft, thinking vaguely about some bees and a fairy queen, when it suddenly flashed into her mind, she was she. She stopped dead, and began looking over all of her person which came within the range of her eyes. She could not see much, except a fore-shortened view of the front of her frock, and her eyes when she lifted them for inspection; but it was enough for her to form a rough idea of the little body she suddenly realised to be hers.She began to laugh, rather mockingly. \u201cWell!\u201d she thought, in effect: \u201cFancy you, of all people, going and getting caught like this! You can\u2019t get out of it now, not for a very long time: you\u2019ll have to go through with being a child, and growing up, and getting old, before you\u2019ll be quit of this mad prank!\u201dBut such examinations of character are not just limited to Emily, as Hughes explores Jonson, along with some of the smaller children, and the increasingly catatonic Margaret - who by novel\u2019s end is being treated cruelly by the children. Jonson has his own dark side and so escapes being a lovable cutout, but succeeds in being very human. At one point we are told he can only draw things related to the ship -- and naked women from every angle. Thus, the reader is rightly troubled by Jonson\u2019s attentions toward Emily. As departure for the children looms, Jonson asks Emily if she loves him. It isn\u2019t an innocent question - though Jonson himself seems uncertain of his impulses toward prepubescent girls. The voyage is a rambling one but, at one point, it is punctuated by the taking of another ship, and tragedy occurs when a captured man is killed - by Emily! At this point the children - in the eyes of the crew - are stripped of their charm. The superstitious sailors now start avoiding the children, and it isn\u2019t long before they realize they\u2019re being pursued. In order to get rid of some damaging evidence (the children), the captain eventually transfers them to a passing ship - though Jonson seems to be seriously considering doing away with them altogether but pulls back when his first mate, Otto, balks at the suggestion. Pirates they may be - but they are not killers, which sadly does them little good by novel\u2019s end. On the way back to England, Emily is visited by a young boy in her cabin. Wanting to be friends with the heroic little girl, he offers her the loan of his baby alligator for the evening. Delighted, Emily looks into the eyes of the creature. Here the reader senses that the heart of Hughes\u2019 novel is not only about good and evil but the grey areas in between:So this was an alligator! She was actually going to sleep with an alligator! She had thought that to anyone who had once been in an earthquake nothing really exciting could happen again: but then, she had not thought of this.There was once a girl called Emily, who slept with an alligator...In search of greater warmth, the creature high-stepped warily up the bed towards her face. About six inches away it paused, and they looked each other in the eye, those two children.The eye of an alligator is large, protruding, and of a brilliant yellow, with a slit pupil like a cat\u2019s. A cat\u2019s eye, to the casual observer, is expressionless: though with attention one can distinguish in it many changes of emotion. But the eye of an alligator is infinitely more stony, and brilliant - reptilian.What possible meaning could Emily find in such an eye? Yet she lay there, and stared and stared: and the alligator stared too. If there had been an observer it might have given him a shiver to see them so - well, eye to eye like that.Most of us have encountered similar children in a somewhat more limited setting in Golding\u2019s Lord of the Flies. The difference between the two novels lies in Hughes\u2019 correct notion that when children are involved, fairy tales (or in this case, fairty tale like telling) can often be better at communicating their emotions of horror, wonder, danger, death, and awakening sexuality."}, {"userName": "Rosana", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/748860-rosana", "userReview": "We had a snow storm that lasted 36 hours or so. While the wind howled outside, I sat by the fireplace with this book all day yesterday. I grabbed it again this morning and, funny thing, the storm let down about the time I finished it this afternoon. Now I don\u2019t know if the storm was so bad as I recall it, or it was this disturbing story that made everything look so dark and disquieting for the past 2 days.First things first, this is not a children\u2019s story. It is not a young-adult story either. It is a very adult and distressing tale, where children happen to be the main protagonists. Hughes genius shows in how well he captures these children\u2019s voices, in special the voice of Emily. The most delightful passage in this story is when suddenly Emily realizes her own existence. She ponders further that maybe she was herself God. My son, now entering teenage years, also tells about the moment he became aware of his own existence. He was more precocious than Emily, but he does not verbalize the experience as she does either. The point is, we all must at one time come to the same conscious realization, and later forget it. Hughes brings it back in a way that is tender, but also rings with truth. Most passages though carry a darkness that cannot be erased very easily by Emily\u2019s existential questionings. There is death, murder, rape, lies, jealousy in every page. The setting also deserves a comment: although I don\u2019t deny that this story may be historically accurate \u2013 I would not doubt that newly freed slaves would not kill their previous masters, be it by starvation or more deliberately feeding them ground glass. Piracy was also probably still very common in the middle of the 19th century. Hangings certainly were, and the inefficiency of the judicial system still is. Hughes\u2019 Jamaica and later London are not the Jamaica and London of this realm, but one from a parallel world, barely more colourful than reality, yet different, more comic or caricature.  It just occurred to me that Hughes might have wanted to tell a more real vision of childhood as opposed to Peter Pan \u2013 another English story about pirates. I should search this before writing about it, but I won\u2019t. I am ready to let go of this tale, as much as I am ready for the Sun to start shining outside. I am giving it 5 stars because I think it defies genre and time, but I don\u2019t think I will re-read it any time soon. I can only take bleakness on small doses."}, {"userName": "Nate D", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/406701-nate-d", "userReview": "Being nearly four years old, she was certainly a child: and children are human (if one allows the term \"human\" in a wide sense): but she had not altogether ceased to be a baby: and babies are of course not human--they are animals, and have a very ancient and ramified culture, as cats have, and fishes, and even snakes: the same in kind as these, but much more complicated and vivid, since babies are, after all, one of the most developed species of the lower vertebrates.It is true they look human--but not so human, to be quiet fair, as many monkeys. Subconsciously, too, everyone recognizes that they are animals--why else do people always laugh when a baby does some action resembling a human, as they would at a praying mantis? If the baby was only a less-developed man, there would be nothing funny in it, surely.Possibly a case might be made that children are not human either: but I should not accept it. Agreed that their minds are not just more ignorant and stupider than ours, but differ in a kind of thinking (are mad, in fact): but one can, by an effort of will and imagination, think like a child, at least in a partial degree--and even if one's success is infinitesimal it invalidates the case: while one can no more think like a baby, in the smallest respect, than one can think like a bee.Beginning this tale of adventure rising out of a tropical fever-dream, I somewhat baffled by Hughes' take on his child-cast, and by why exactly he wanted to write about them so oddly. But really, his portrayal is only odd by comparison to more usual treatments. Hughes actually understands exactly what children are like, and exactly how difficult they are to understand by normal adult interpretations. His entirely unsentimental portrayal is as brisk and funny as it is disconcerting, and both of these sides feel nothing but excruciatingly accurate. It's really quite remarkable that people can live with them around (children, that is). But then, perhaps the irrational and occult world of childhood has its benefits over a rationalized adult world that does such as this:Trials are over quickly, once they begin. It was no time before the judge had condemned these prisoners to death and was trying someone else with the same concentrated, benevolent, individual attention."}, {"userName": "Luxor", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1549721-luxor", "userReview": "Como ferviente admirador de ese gran cineasta casi olvidado que fue Alexander Mackendrick siempre he tenido la curiosidad por leer \"Hurac\u00e1n en Jamaica\", el libro en el que se basa una de sus mejores pel\u00edculas \"Viento en las velas\" (como se titul\u00f3 en Espa\u00f1a).

Frightening, pointless, accidental violence is quickly forgotten and covered over. Nothing important just happened.What, for me, is most memorable in this story is that very many of the tragic events are simply accidental\u2014or understandable overreactions to misunderstood fear or immediate terror\u2014like a pet\u2019s instantaneous savagery when startled.

Richard Hughes's novel follows the story of the Bas-Thorton children as they are sent away from their childhood home of Jamaica by their parents, and captured en route to England by a band of pirates. The set up sounds like your standard adventure novel, and in some ways it is. But it's also a really interesting look at memory, how certain events are amplified into great importance while others - ones that should objectively be more important - are muted. Early in the story Emily, the most complex of the children (or at least the most explored), experiences both an earthquake and a violent hurricane. The former is very minor - no one around her is hurt and it doesn't have a lasting impact on her life. The latter is much more 'important' - it results in several deaths, destroys the family's home, and results in the kids being shipped off to England. But Emily sees the earthquake as far more important - it's an Earthquake with a Capital E, an event that makes her interesting and gives color and texture to her life. Hurricanes, though this one was worse than most, happen all the time. My friend mentioned to me that this book looks at children as if they were a different species, and I think that's a very apt way to look at it. It's a very lonely book: characters live entirely in their own worlds, bumping into each other, taking past each other, creating confusion, sadness, or anger.It's beautifully written, as well.

At the same time, A High Wind also questions any judgments we make about situations we did not experience - false interpretations of events abound due to hasty assumptions, and this repeatedly leads to tragedy and injustice (this is a surprisingly brutal and violent book.)

The book, exploring the imaginative world of childhood, also explores the worlds we can take for granted despite their horror and danger, and what it means to have or develop empathy and conscience.

The mentioned reason is concerned with its black-and-white film version (1965) I enjoyed watching on television some 44 years ago, wondering who wrote this novel with a seemingly romantic title; it was the first time I knew Richard Hughes so I delightfully bought its Penguin paperback paying THB 18 at the D.K. Book House in Bangkok (now a copy of brownish and brittle paper, it needs to be handled with care due to its age) one day in January 1973. I found reading it much tougher than expected and took years to finish it. Ultimately, I couldn't help wondering why it was so tough that I gave up reading after a few pages and left it at that till I had the heart to go on, that is, a chapter for one sitting was out of the question. Coming to think of it after my revisit, there are obviously at least two factors: the first being his obvious masterly-style English, and the second being the unfamiliar nautical technical terms related to the Clorinda (the first vessel, a barque, with the children on board) and the schooner (the one with the pirates). Why? I would say something and cite some examples soon.An English extract from the second paragraph of Chapter 1 would briefly reveal my point:One scene is very clear in my mind, in Jamaica. There was a vast stone-built house called Derby Hill (where the Parkers lived). It had been the centre of a very prosperous plantation. With Emancipation, like many others, that went bung. The sugar buildings fell down. Bush smothered the cane and guinea-grass. . . . (p. 5)Some difficulties: A query has since kept irritating me on the narrator (in my mind, I in other pages); surprisingly, he/she is anonymous till the end. The other points are concerned with 'Emancipation' and 'that went bung' of which their meanings we hopefully find out on the Wiktionary. So from this example it seems to me the difficulties are in terms of semantics rather than grammar. As for the meanings of schooner-related technical terms, I would cite only 7 words: jib-boom (p. 134), port-side (p. 135), fo'c'sle hatch (p. 135), bowsprit (p. 135), hanks of the jib (p. 135), fore-hold (p. 137), main-hatch (p. 137).Modern readers, I think, may have limited interest in this novel due to probably its less or unknown fame due to its first publication in 1929, 89 years ago so this Wikipedia site is for you: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_High_... Furthermore, it has been acclaimed as the one that 'influenced twentieth-century feeling about children as decisively as Freud'. (p. i) In other words, it is a classic one that has since helped adults better understand children from their words and deeds, from their viewpoints and behaviors, rather than from one-sided dogmas and discipline asserted by adults since centuries in most countries in the world.One of the reasons concerning its classic category is that its plot is remarkably simple but touching, that is, it is about a group of English children kidnapped by the pirates along their way to England and they are fond of those youngsters, it is divinely miraculous to read on how they live, talk, adjust themselves, etc. instead of cruelty, horror, language abuse, etc. normally expected since the pirates are commonly merciless and heartless to the extent that they can be inhumanly brutal to their hearts' content. A fact on Emily, the protagonist, is that she is only ten years old but she is wise, poised and elegant, in other words, she has her own character which Captain Jonsen, Otto and other pirates have since learnt to know her, gradually respect her and thus treat the captives as reasonably and kindly as can be till they find the ship, bade goodbye and allow them on board safely for England.As for its availability, we may try to borrow one from any good public/university library. Then, we'd be quite lucky if some copies can be found and bought from our favorite second-hand bookshops in major cities in the world. I'm not sure if new copies are on the shelves in those large bookstores in, say, Bangkok, London, Tokyo, Brisbane, Singapore, etc. However, don't give up trying since we can still contact Penguin or Amazon.com via their websites.

Its tone is oscillating, meandering between poetic and psychological contemplations, subtle irony and sturdy humor and takes the reader along on an adventurously sea journey exploring the borderland between innocence and atrocity. Similar to Henry James\u00b4 \u201cThe Turn of a Screw\u201d the reader is confronted with the question whether or not children really are the little innocent angels often imagined in the Victorian society. And what is it that adults know for sure about children and what do children understand from the grown-up world? The expedition Hughes invites us to take part in offers a diversity of possibilities to trace this question.In the center of the novel we find 10 year old Emily Bas-Thornton who is going to undertake a sea journey from Jamaica to England. The year is about 1860 and Emily will travel with her four siblings and two neighborhood children after the plantation of her parents has been devastated by a heavy thunderstorm (by the way: never have I read such a compelling description of a storm). Does Emily love her parents, will she miss them? That\u00b4s hard to say, her mother thinks she does, but maybe Emily rather got used to them instead of feeling love. In Emily\u00b4s world this is not a question of big importance, which is quite strange to read if you have children of your own.The journey has just begun when the ship is boarded by surprisingly civilized pirates. The kids will stay on the pirate\u2019s ship from now on without recognizing the situation, but maybe they just don\u00b4t want to see what\u00b4s going on? Then Emilys older brother John dies in a self-inflicted accident. How should the poor pirates explain this to the authorities in case they get pinched? All they wanted was to get rid of the children without trouble as soon as possible. But the situation gets worse. Emily stabs a man who is taken prisoner by the pirates. You have to feel sympathy for the pirates now. No wonder the pirates are relieved when an opportunity comes up to deliver the children to a passenger liner. But that\u00b4s not the end of the story for them\u2026Tone and mood of the novel are shifting, maybe because Hughes was working on this novel for three years, interrupted by private crises. So sometimes the book seems somewhat erratic, and yet I found it rewarding and liked it very much. The story is entertaining and exhilarating and modern in its question what the individual can know for sure about the world and about itself. Time and again Hughes describes misapprehensions and misjudgments based on perspective contortions and misunderstandings. Soon after it was published in England this book was celebrated as a modern classic while in Germany it was almost forgotten and it took 55 Years before Verlag Neue Kritik published it anew. Now it\u00b4s up to the reader to take care that this treasure will not vanish again.Dieser schmale Roman, den Richard Hughes (1900-1976) 1929 ver\u00f6ffentlichte, pr\u00e4sentiert sich als Wundert\u00fcte, die f\u00fcr den Leser immer wieder \u00dcberraschungen bereit h\u00e4lt. In stark oszillierendem Tonfall, der abwechselt zwischen poetischen und psychologischen Betrachtungen, zwischen feiner Ironie und handfestem Humor, nimmt er den Leser auf eine abenteuerliche Seereise mit und erkundet das Grenzland zwischen Unschuld und Grausamkeit. Wie bereits Henry James in \u201eThe Turn of a Screw\u201c wird der Leser auch hier mit der Frage konfrontiert, ob Kinder wirklich die Unschuldsengel sind, f\u00fcr die sie \u2013 vor allem in der viktorianischen Gesellschaft \u2013 immer gehalten werden. Und was k\u00f6nnen Erwachsene \u00fcberhaupt von Kindern wissen, was verstehen diese von der Erwachsenenwelt? Die Expedition, zu der Hughes uns einl\u00e4dt, bietet vielf\u00e4ltige M\u00f6glichkeiten, diesen Fragen nachzugehen.Im Zentrum des Romans steht die 10-j\u00e4hrige Emily Bas-Thornton, die gemeinsam mit ihren vier Geschwistern sowie zwei Nachbarskindern um 1860 Jamaica von den Eltern auf eine Seereise nach England geschickt wird, nachdem ein Unwetter (Bemerkung am Rande: selten habe ich eine bessere Schilderung gelesen) die Familien ihrer Behausung auf Jamaica beraubt hat. Doch schon nach kurzer Seefahrt wird das Schiff von erstaunlich freundlichen Piraten gekapert und die Kinder setzen ihre Reise auf deren Schiff fort, ohne die Situation zu erkennen bzw. erkennen zu wollen. Durch eigenes Verschulden kommt Emilys \u00e4lterer Bruder John ums Leben und Emily ersticht einen Gefangenen. So nimmt es nicht wunder, dass die Piraten froh sind, die Kinder schlie\u00dflich an ein Passagierschiff abgeben zu d\u00fcrfen. Doch damit ist die Geschichte f\u00fcr sie noch lange nicht zu Ende\u2026Der Tonfall wechselt, wie eingangs schon erw\u00e4hnt, h\u00e4ufiger, was damit zusammenh\u00e4ngen k\u00f6nnte, dass Hughes an diesem Buch drei Jahre geschrieben hat, unterbrochen von pers\u00f6nlichen Krisen. So wirken einige Passagen und \u00dcberg\u00e4nge etwas sprunghaft, die Handlung ist nicht gleichm\u00e4\u00dfig ausgeleuchtet. Trotzdem habe ich die Lekt\u00fcre als sehr belohnend empfunden, da sie kurzweilig und anregend ist. Der Roman wirkt auch sehr modern in der Fragestellung, was das Individuum verl\u00e4sslich \u00fcber sich und seine Welt wissen kann. So schildert Hughes immer wieder auch Missverst\u00e4ndnisse und Fehleinsch\u00e4tzungen, die auf unzureichendem Urteilsverm\u00f6gen und perspektivischen Verzerrungen beruhen, ohne den Roman deshalb in dramatische Ernsthaftigkeit abdriften zu lassen. \u201eSturmwind auf Jamaica\u201c wurde in England schon kurz nach Erscheinen als moderner Klassiker gefeiert, ist dann aber weitestgehend in Vergessenheit geraten. Der Verlag Neue Kritik hat ihn 2005 erstmals nach 55 Jahren in Deutschland wieder zug\u00e4nglich gemacht und nun liegt es am Leser, dieses Kleinod nicht wieder in der Versenkung verschwinden zu lassen."}, {"userName": "emily", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/104806-emily", "userReview": "A confession: every now and then, when telling a story that took place some time ago, I find myself thinking \"did that actually happen that way, or have I maybe changed it a little bit over time?\" I'm not saying I'm a pathological liar, or even that I have an unusually shaky relationship with the truth.

The reading group members' opinions ranged from \"hated it\" to ho hum, except for me. I found it a great read, totally entertaining and full of interesting questions about child rearing and the uses of children in the legal system. An English family lives in a decayed plantation house in late 19th century Jamaica, post emancipation. Their five children are fed, put to bed at night after being read to, but otherwise are left to roam about having adventures in the great outdoors. \"It was a kind of paradise for English children to come to, whatever it might be for their parents: especially at that time, when no one lived in at all a wild way at home. Here one had to be a little ahead of the times or decadent, whichever you like to call it. The difference between boys and girls, for instance, had to be left to look after itself. Long hair would have made the evening search for grass-ticks and nits interminable. Emily and Rachel had their hair cut short and were allowed to do everything the boys did--to climb trees, swim and trap animals and birds; they even had two pockets in their frocks.\" Feral children then, who also read books. Cool; reminded me of my hippie days when the kids ran wild. But then, after a ferocious hurricane nearly levels their house, the parents suddenly decide that their children need a proper education. They put them all on a ship bound for England, entrusting these children to the care of the ship's captain. Now we are really far removed from the present day where children (at least the ones above the poverty line) are guarded from kidnappers and worse. Well, the ship is boarded by pirates before it has even left the Caribbean Sea, the children taken on to the pirate ship and then their adventures truly begin. From horrific to heartwarming, from dangerous to delightful and everything in between, they learn to climb the rigging, sleep in a hold, tame the ship's monkey and relate to the pirates. The journey to England on the pirate ship takes up most of the book. That is enough of a spoiler right there because, while reading, you wonder if they will make it. Not one child escapes being marked by the experience, some more deeply than others. My dad used to tell me that a person could get used to anything, which I did not believe as a child, but truly children can adapt to their circumstances, make do and figure out how to survive in about the same proportion as adults.

Unfinished books cause one minute of anxiety for: (every year they're not finished) X (the number of hundreds of pages in the book) X (1 + the percentage of the book finished). A High Wind in Jamaica sat unfinished for 10 years. There are 200 pages. I had finished 10 percent of it.So, 10 X 2 X 1.10 = 22.

Nine times a year, for 15 seconds each--and so a life passes--I remembered my small failure. Not much, but worth allaying.Meanwhile, Joseph Conrad's Lord Jim is the pinnacle of what I'm calling the Anxiety of the Unfinished. Festering for 12 years. 400 pages.

Low expectations aside, I was pleasantly surprised.It features children and pirates, but not silly caricatures.

It\u2019s far less a ripping yarn than an extraordinary reckoning with the secret reasons and otherworldly realities of childhood.

Servants put glass in the food of two old ladies and kill them within the first two pages. There's lots of animals, which are used to highlight the thoughtless barbarism as well as the fleeting empathy of the kids. I kept highlighting pieces on my Nook like, \"One cannot wish for a more comfortable seat than an acquiescent pig.\""}, {"userName": "Cphe", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14907696-cphe", "userReview": "An unusual novel with some quite malevolent undertones. Enjoyed the setting, a lush and sultry Jamaica and life aboard a pirate vessel. It was the characters themselves that I found difficult to like, both child and adult. It's certainly a well written novel just not one that I felt an affinity to."}], "description": "New edition of a classic adventure novel and one of the most startling, highly praised stories in English literature - a brilliant chronicle of two sensitive children's violent voyage from innocence to experience.After a terrible hurricane levels their Jamaican estate, the Bas-Thorntons decide to send their children back to the safety and comfort of England. On the way their ship is set upon by pirates, and the children are accidentally transferred to the pirate vessel. Jonsen, the well-meaning pirate captain, doesn't know how to dispose of his new cargo, while the children adjust with surprising ease to their new life. As this strange company drifts around the Caribbean, events turn more frightening and the pirates find themselves increasingly incriminated by the children's fates. The most shocking betrayal, however, will take place only after the return to civilization.The swift, almost hallucinatory action of Hughes's novel, together with its provocative insight into the psychology of children, made it a best seller when it was first published in 1929 and has since established it as a classic of twentieth-century literature - an unequaled exploration of the nature, and limits, of innocence.", "title": "A High Wind in Jamaica", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/188458.A_High_Wind_in_Jamaica", "average": 3.79, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388190660l/188458.jpg", "reviews": 675, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/295289.Richard_Hughes", "name": "Richard Hughes"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/12180.Francine_Prose", "name": "Francine Prose"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Classics", "Adventure", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/188458.A_High_Wind_in_Jamaica", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9995030-a-high-wind-in-jamaica", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32199792-hurac-n-en-jamaica", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/69710.A_High_Wind_In_Jamaica", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2161435.A_High_Wind_In_Jamaica", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16083435-sturmwind-auf-jamaica", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10969187-a-high-wind-in-jamaica", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/311421.The_Fox_in_the_Attic", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2376114.In_Hazard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/726384.The_Wooden_Shepherdess", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2211075.Gertrude_s_Child", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2266372.The_Spider_s_Palace_and_Other_Stories", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31160055-the-last-cherry-blossom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26583370-life-and-other-near-death-experiences", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20552595-how-i-became-a-famous-novelist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
