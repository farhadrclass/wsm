WE BELIEVE IN THE STUFFED ANIMAL! WE LOVE THE STUFFED ANIMAL!I have seriously donated garbage bag upon garbage bags of stuffed animals to the children's home though. But, my stuffed animals will always be huge. These are not even the half of them =) PS ~ I'm getting one more garbage bag ready to go to the children's home when I go to the doctor in February. But never fear, at some point they will be replaced!!!! lol Oh, and the big ones are kinda hiding the big pile that is on the bed you can't see and there are big ones under that pile too. I love them alllllllllllllllllllll ! My dog Lucy's pile down below =) Down below \u2193I don't say my body is a temple but I do repeat over and over, you shouldn't be eating this, STOP!!!! \u2191 This always happened just like the picture shows! Okay so I don't have kids and I'm not a grandma, but I do have about a million notebooks and journals that I collect and have written in like two. And only in half of the two. I can't help myself! The above picture is totally true. I never wanted kids and I don't have them and it's too late for all of that and I'm fine with it =) Okay the wifi thing is self explanatory! and the book thing, we all get that one! I thought this book was soooooo cute! There are a good bit of cute funny stuff in the book and it's worth a pick up and read =)MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List"}, {"userName": "Alienor \u2718 French Frowner \u2718", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31461418-alienor-french-frowner", "userReview": "\u2728 AVAILABLE NOW! \u2728 THANK YOU, Sarah Andersen. I mean it.See, it seems to me lately that everyone around me has some variation of \"You are an adult, you must-\" sentence ready to throw it on me. Real adults don\u2019t read that much because when are you going to take time for making babies? (really)Real women know how to cook/clean up everything without complaining (you don\u2019t say)Real women want kids, too (back off)Real adults always wake up early (as if)Real \u2013 *internal screaming**INTERLUDE**/INTERLUDE*The truth is, I respect all the checklists of my definition of adulthood and it\u2019s enough for me : I take care of my loved ones, pay my bills, work my best for my pupils, respect the law, assume myself, as in, I am independent. Being an adult isn\u2019t about fulfilling some aged fantasies in which women are sort of superheroes who raise kids, are sexy, work like hell and fucking smile all the time because HEY! LIFE\u2019S AWESOME! Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that nobody can be happy like this - It's not me is all.I don\u2019t feel less adult because no, I don\u2019t spend my Sundays cleaning the house like crazy (and somehow it's still clean, mind you)I don\u2019t feel less adult because yes sometimes I play videogames *GASP*I sure don't feel less adult because I don't have kids. I am an adult, but perhaps my definition isn\u2019t the same as yours. Who cares? I'm sure not here to judge. Everybody needs to find his own happy place in my opinion, and I found mine, as you found yours.This book explores what adulthood is about and how frightening and confusing it can be, with all the expectations and other stereotypes which can be motivating but also so very stressful. Although I didn\u2019t relate to every anecdote (I\u2019ve been in a loving relationship for 7 years and am lucky enough to have a stable job), Sarah Andersen managed to capture perfectly what it means to be an \u201cadult\u201d nowadays while making me laugh \u2013 not to mention all these OMG I AM NOT ALONE! moments I lived along the way (I won\u2019t say which ones. Because of reasons).As for the art, I\u2019m not sure I like it but it definitely helps staying focused on the story related and never diminished my enjoyment during my read.\u25ba Recommended for every lover of pajamas out there. *winks* *arc kindly provided by Andrews McMeel Publishing through Netgalley in exchange for an honest review*For more of my reviews, please visit:"}, {"userName": "Natalie Monroe", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6688207-natalie-monroe", "userReview": "This whole book is my spirit animal.

And I read this book while enjoying a Milka & Oreo chocolate.Sarah Andersen does a great job at showing the hardships of girls and women while keeping it light and funny. It's amazing how easy I could relate to her drawings. I kept showing some of the drawings to my husband and he was impressed and could not believe someone would write about me. Especially the part about not growing up. He says that, according to Sarah Andersen, I am in my mid 20'. Anyway, I really need to get my hands on a paperback copy. If you liked Allie Brosh's Hyperbole and a Half: Unfortunate Situations, Flawed Coping Mechanisms, Mayhem, and Other Things That Happened, you'll love Adulthood is a Myth: A \"Sarah's Scribbles\" Collection.*I thank Sarah Andersen, Andrews McMeel Publishing, and Netgalley for this copy in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Mar\u00eda", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17754092-mar-a", "userReview": "Cu\u00e1nto me alegra que Sarah Andersen est\u00e9 en nuestro planeta."}, {"userName": "Florencia", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21575078-florencia", "userReview": "Is adulthood an exciting new challenge for which you feel fully prepared? Ugh. Please go away.\nI was writing down some thoughts for two reviews, one of a Mishima book and the other of The Bell Jar, but at the moment, I don\u2019t feel like dedicating so much time to that kind of introspection, since in my case, reviewing a book is almost never writing a simple summary. So I will deal with all those books next year, while focusing on other works which are also existentially complex but from a different perspective. A very different perspective.In the spirit of the preceding paragraph, I have a shocking revelation to share. I can never participate in the GR Awards. Scandalous, right? I mean, after the Best Poetry debacle, it\u2019s still nice to be able to cast some votes considering that, in general, the most recently published book I have read might have been in the bookshop for twenty years. Another delightful fact I can find in this little adventure regarding the Best Books of 2016 that I almost never pay special attention to: the only book to which I could give my precious and humble vote was Adulthood is a Myth. The irony makes me chuckle. In any case, and in my opinion since not everyone shares my peculiar sense of humor, it was a fun read. The most hilarious, ridiculous, absurd and to some extent, pathetic aspects of life are depicted through comedy and simple, adorable drawings. Andersen's keen ability to perceive different feelings and situations pertaining to the issue of being human and to portray them with such humorous simplicity\u2026 it is certainly remarkable. I\u2019m completely enamored with her work and Allie Brosh and her Hyperbole and a Half: Unfortunate Situations, Flawed Coping Mechanisms, Mayhem, and Other Things That Happened now share the podium with lovely Andersen. Classics, poetry, extremely dark and heart-rending books that may or may not have a happy ending are not enough. Books brimful of humor, wit, ludicrous yet common situations and reactions and with silly covers that I don't dare to show in public are also a part of me. They mend what other things have broken. They make reality taste like fiction for a while. This year I spent time on situations that, in the end, didn\u2019t deserve my attention and a million chances. I can search for my lost time but will never get it back. Still, despite giving too much and receiving \u00fcber-nothing at times, I would like to end this year with a smile. Perhaps, what I consider a flaw is precisely why I should be smiling.This charming book won Best Graphic Novels & Comics. I thought of giving a little speech but, you know.Besides, giving speeches usually precedes a simple meal or large quantities of food and......let\u2019s just not tempt fate. So I wrote this nonsense instead, as I also tell you this: Sarah and I will be back in a few days. For now, I\u2019ll keep reading my books and enjoying one of my valid hobbies.

I read it in one sitting and laughed out loud several times, and I definitely took a picture of a few of these comics to send to friends or post on snapchat. As an anxious bookworm, I really connected with parts of it.The only thing I'm not fond of is there's a few times that this book falls into the mentality of \"I hate people!! I want to be alone all the time because I hate every single person I know!!\" and I feel like that's such a Tumblr 2012 mentality that I don't find funny or edgy anymore.

I've seen her comics floating around on social media for years, laughed at them, wondered how such simplistic drawings could be so relatable, and then moved on without giving it so much as a second thought. Then I stumbled upon Adulthood Is A Myth, and now I'm a big fan. Adulthood Is A Myth isn't so much a comic book in that it doesn't tell a continuous story, but it is a book of comics - they are unrelated but well worth reading at once. I found myself sitting by myself in a room giggling like a crazy person because the comics within this book were so cute and charming. For every little drawing, I felt like Sarah had tapped into my inner thoughts and admitted to the truth of growing up that many of us aim to hide. If you're looking for something easy to read that will surely bring you joy and more than a few laughs, I cannot recommend this more. I checked this out on Hoopla via my local public library, but would gladly purchase in the future in order to support the author and encourage her to continue creating such adorable art. What did I think?: I'm a big comic book fan, and while this isn't necessarily telling a story it is cute and fun which is exactly what I was looking for.

I am again completely unable to understand all the hype, all the fuss, all the praise, and most definitely cringe when savoring the thought of Adulthood Is a Myth being the winner of Graphic Novels & Comics category here at Goodreads. In fact, when I look at the runner ups, I just want to facepalm my face off to the idea of all the wonderful talent, not just with writing but with beautiful art, that have been overshadowed by the simple cartoon strips that has been done countless of times before. That ain't right, and it ain't an attack toward this work, but an attack toward Goodreads categories.Adulthood Is a Myth is not something that really resonates with me. Adulthood has never been a problem to me, I have never felt the pressure of it, I have never felt the need to justify my actions or my way of living. There is a lot of elements in my life that speaks volumes of the fact that I am an adult, as in having responsibilities, but there is a lot of aspects that are dealt within this work that should, apparently, cause distress. I sleep too little as I love to be up late, and with having kids, have very little possibilities to sleep late. But when the kids get older, I am able to nod off as I please, which is pretty much the case now. I take naps almost daily, I spend most of my days in pajamas. I play with my kids toys, I play video games, I keep movie marathons where I spend 24 hours in front of my TV screen or in front of my projector's wall screen. When the family goes out, I lay on my ass all day long, reading or watching telly. I eat what I want, I exercise whenever I want to. I do not have a good relationship with authority of any kind, but rebel at every chance I get. I very rarely participate to things that would be \"necessary\" as an adult, as an parent. I only like my own kids, other kids are just annoyance in middle of my peace. In reality, I am as selfish than I was at the age of fifteen despite of living \"like an adult in an adult life\". I like being by myself as much as I ever have, which is pretty much all the time. I just never knew I should actually stress over it, and maybe write poorly witty comics of it. I always learn more, everyday. But, there is something I wish more women would stop doing. Honestly, this is so uncool, so useless, so insecure that it turns to ugly faster than I can write it down. And it is pretty much this:Yeah, I just don't get Adulthood Is a Myth, but being an adult means I do not even have to. How fucking cool is that."}, {"userName": "Farith", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31454912-farith", "userReview": "Have you ever been in that kind of situation where you felt too awkward or embarrassed and all you wanted is to be buried alive?

Well then let me tell you that this book is for you if you answered yes!

I felt identified in every single page. Every. Single. One.When I was a kid the thing I most wanted was to grow up, now I regret a little having wished that, you know? Now that I have to face adulting, college and all that crap I am FREAKING OUT. I can't stand the idea of living alone and having to do everything by my own. ALONE. I know, adulting is scary and everything but we have to step forward the future, don't we? *Me \"trying\" to accept adulting*First stop, my life communication.As a boy with many trust issues when I was growing up, I was the worst at communicating and this happened me a lot.

There were entries about books, being an introvert, clothes, and all kind of little things that come up in life. Some of the comics made me glad that I am not the only one that has noticed some of these things. These were comics that I found myself constantly sharing with my husband. He likes it when I try to make reading a group sport.The artwork in this book wasn't complex but it worked well. I think that art really was perfect to illustrate this imperfect little character.
