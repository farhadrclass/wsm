Decisive Date: When sexy Zoe Laforge\u2019s lover, Rick, is murdered before her eyes, Zoe is on the run from the assassin and crooked cops. But if they thought Zoe would be an easy target they were very much mistaken, for Zoe has followed the disciplines of the martial arts for many years and is also an expert markswoman. Zoe follows the clue Rick left her to retrieve evidence to bring the bad guys down, and she\u2019ll let nothing stop her. Lioness\u2019 Heart: Zoe is recruited into a secret ops team and given a new identity: Zoe Lionheart. As an IT maven, her job is to infiltrate organizations that threaten the security of the United States and gather evidence. But when Zoe\u2019s cover is broken, she is captured and finds herself on her own with no backup. Zoe fights her way free, leaving carnage in her wake and returns to her team to tell them she has discovered a devious plot involving biological warfare that threatens twenty-five million people worldwide. Lioness\u2019 Claws: Zoe knew she was fast but not that she was exceptionally so, until Doc Holiday tells her she has outpaced and outfought the top people in their field. He confides to Matt, the team\u2019s leader, that Zoe\u2019s feels emotionally rewarded when she kills and warns him that everything that can be done to keep Zoe stable should be pursued. Matt senses there is more to Zoe than the ice-cold killer, and learns that Zoe\u2019s past holds a secret that even she is unaware of. More incredible action takes place when Zoe\u2019s team sets out to save the world and and when they land in trouble, Zoe must save them. Valerie Long knows how to create exciting plots, complex characters and attention to technical detail. I was alternately shocked by Zoe\u2019s actions and sympathetic to her dilemmas. Long pulls no punches when it comes to graphic, realistic action. Zoe is a no-nonsense, no compromise seductress abruptly hurled into an exciting and dangerous world that is her natural element. But Zoe also has to fight her own instability. Read her story and you, too, will fall under her siren spell."}, {"userName": "Valerie Long", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2648140-valerie-long", "userReview": "Zoes erstes Abenteuer in drei Teilen / I.
