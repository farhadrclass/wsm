When Frank is offered a chance to manage a factory in Girbaud, India, the couple leap at the opportunity to get away from the constant reminders of their loss. But Frank transfers his love for his son onto Ramesh, the engaging, bright child of the people who take care of their house. His inability to truly get past the death of his own child and his desperate attachment to this Indian boy lead to a series of increasingly bad decisions. Umrigar shows us the intersection where East and West meet, on a painfully personal level. There is no idealization of India here. Cultural warts are on full display. As are the more attractive elements of the Indian culture that make Ellie Benton feel that she is becoming truly local. Larger issues are brought to the fore as well, conflicts between tradition and modernity, between globalization and local values, between haves and have-nots at several levels. And while the insensitivity of the corporate West is portrayed neither is the West pilloried as having nothing to offer the Indian people.It is a fast and intensely engaging read. I was moved to tears by this story. I had to stop myself from publicly dripping on the subways where I do most of my book reading, saving that for more private places. That this tale is so emotionally charged does not make it a melodramatic weepy. Do read it armed with some tissues, but the joy here is how well Umrigar portrays the details of grief, of a marriage under enormous stress. It is also more than merely a personal tale. The title refers to morality, and the choices characters make here are to be seen through the lens of right and wrong. Her ability to effectively portray personal trauma while painting a larger picture of disparate worlds intersecting, and do so in an accessible, personal way makes this is a wonderful novel.Review posted \u2013 April 2009Review re-posted \u2013 May 22, 2015Publication date \u2013 April 14, 2009=============================EXTRA STUFFLinks to the author\u2019s personal, Twitter and FB pagesAn audio interview in which Umrigar discusses, among other things, her sources of inspiration for writing this novel.An interesting interview with Umrigar in AsiaSource.orgUmrigar is interviewed on The Writers Voice .The Weight of Heaven piece is part of the podcast at the bottom of the page, the interview running from 28:20 to 49:00.

It was one of those novels that made the author an instant favorite of mine. I knew I had to read every book she wrote. I haven't quite managed that, but it's still something I'm working on. I followed The Space Between Us up with Bombay Time and now The Weight of Heaven.What I love most about Thrity Umrigar is her gift for drawing out the emotions of her characters. The reader gets to know them through and through, feel what they are going through, know what they are thinking, and feel like we know them just as well as we do ourselves. At least that's how it is for me.The Weight of Heaven is more than what it might first appear. An American man and woman grieving for their lost son move to India in hopes of reconnecting with each other and starting a new life. Their 7-year-old son had been their world. His death has torn them apart. Frank Benton blames his wife, Ellie, for their son's death, despite her doing everything she could to save him. His anger has put a wall between them that, at times, seems insurmountable.Ellie is determined to save her marriage, while Frank, haunted by the memories of his son, turns his affections toward an Indian boy, Ramesh, the son of the household cook and maid. In his own way, Frank wants to piece his family back together. However, the path he chooses to do that will have drastic consequences.Ellie comes to love India, both the culture and the people. She is a psychologist and volunteers her time helping the people of Girbaug, the community in which they reside. She is well liked not only by the other characters in the book, but by me as well. She was not perfect by any means, but she has good sense and a thoughtful manner about her.Frank's experience in India is much different. He runs the Indian division of an American company and faces constant conflict with his low paid workers and the locals whose land the company bought from the government. He has a more cynical view of the country. The death of an employee rattles him, especially the circumstances surrounding that death. And on top of that is his own overwhelming grief for his son.I will be honest. I never grew to like Frank. I wanted to, at least on some level. I tried to understand him, knowing that people deal with their grief differently. His pain was palatable as was Ellie's. I wanted so much to reach into the book and comfort them both. I wanted to save Frank from himself. Because, even if I didn't care much for Frank or the decisions he made, I still felt for him, could see how the life he is trying to put together for himself is unraveling. He truly is a lost soul, who, in his desperation, made the wrong choices.I was most drawn to the story of Prakash and Edna, Ramesh's parents. Prakash, in particular. He is a complicated character with many layers. He was not the most likeable, I suppose, but, like Frank, there is a desperation about him, a longing. His only son is being showered with affection by an American man, offered things Prakash could not offer Ramesh. His once happy marriage is not so good anymore. His life was not what he wanted it to be. Edna only wants what is best for her son. She is torn between her loyalty to her family and letting her son experience the finer things in life. Where her husband drinks himself into a stupor and hardly spends time with their son, here is a wealthy American family who encourages his education and welcomes Ramesh into their home.Just as the personal aspects of the novel are emotionally charged, so are the social issues brought to the forefront: the impact of globalization on a small community and the cultural clashes between the Indians and the foreigners. The author offers a look into varying perspectives, providing a well rounded picture of the world and the characters she has created in the novel. And, although I am not going into depth about this aspect of the book, it was perhaps the piece I found most intriguing of all.I barely have touched on the surface of the novel. It is multi-faceted to be sure. It is rich in culture and character. The Weight of Heaven was in some ways just as I expected, but it also held much surprise. It was not quite the novel I expected it to be. Thrity Umrigar proved yet again why she is one of my favorite authors.Book Source: Bought for myself."}, {"userName": "Lara", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1021604-lara", "userReview": "I am in awe of Thrity Umrigar. I enjoyed her previous book, The Space Between Us, but The Weight of Heaven positively blew me away. Even though this book drips with sadness and grief and made me want to throw it against the wall toward the end, I still give this one five stars because...well, WOW. When I read, I like to flip up the bottom corner of pages where there are passages, phrases, ideas that I like or that impress me in some way or that make me want to talk about them. If you look at my copy of this book, practically every other page is dogged like this. From Ellie's realization of the inanity in saying \"Have a nice day\" (p. 21) to perfectly illustrative phrases like, \"Her hands shook like birds in a rainstorm\" (p. 234) , The Weight of Heaven makes me wish my book club were talking about this book RIGHT NOW.So, what's it about? It is the story of an American couple (Ellie and Frank) whose 7-year-old son has died, leaving them crippled with grief. (And the grief, oh my god, the GRIEF. If you read this book, do not attempt to read it on your commuter train, or you will find yourself fighting tears at 8:00 a.m., surrounded by strangers.) Actually, I'm not sure I could read this if I had kids. I don't know if my heart could take it. Anyway, Frank's company offers him a position managing the company's India office, and he and Ellie decide to go. Frank's business is more complicated than he thought when he took the job, with clashing cultural and economic ideas between himself (and his counterparts back in America) and the impoverished workforce and local residents - a situation that makes him hate India and everything about it; whereas Ellie finds friendship and fulfillment in volunteering in the community and feels precisely the opposite. As all of this is playing out, they (and, particularly, Frank) take an interest in their housekeepers' young son, which adds a new layer of cultural and economic tension to their lives and to their marriage.The Weight of Heaven is well-written and fascinating and impossible to put down. Downright excellent, actually. **PS - I forgot two things. (1) I think a lot of you will hate the ending; and (2) This book reminded me of this one class that I took in college that was supposed to be a contemporary literature class but instead was taught by a dude who should have named it \"dystopian literature\" - except instead of it being a true dystopia, it would be like a marital version of dystopia. I'm not sure I'm making any sense, but I thought it might be relevant enough to repeat here."}, {"userName": "Judy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3333943-judy", "userReview": "This novel, about a couple who loses a child and goes to India to try to reassemble their marriage, is well loved here on GR. I could barely stand to read it. Cliches (\"for all the world\" was used numerous times)and overwritten passages about how people were feeling cancelled out the interesting things she had to say about American multinational business and ripping off the natural resource of an Indian village. I could tell things were going to go very wrong by the end but was not expecting how melodramatic and over the top it would be.

I hope never to answer that question, but the main characters in this book, Frank and Ellie, are forced to address their grief when their only son, Benny, dies unexpectedly. Frank has an opportunity to move to India, and he and Ellie see this as a chance to try to heal their wounds and keep their marriage from falling apart. Their decision seems logical - a move to a completely new country where people and places will not remind them of their lost son. As they adjust to their new life in India, Frank befriends a young boy, Ramesh, the son of their housekeepers. Whether due to his grief or his true selfish personality, Frank is incapable of recognizing the conflicted feelings that his friendship causes for his wife and the parents of the young boy. These conflicting emotions, compounded with the differences in culture between the United States and India would make this a wonderful book club selection because of the number of discussion topics. While this is not a \"happy\" book, due to the primary subject matter, it was still a very good book, with well developed characters and an unexpected ending."}, {"userName": "Serena", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1349220-serena", "userReview": "Thrity Umrigar's The Weight of Heaven is a heavy with grief, emptiness, and struggle. The Bentons (Ellie and Frank) lose their son, Benny, at age seven from meningococcus. Ellie has liberal leanings politically and is a therapist to clients in Ann Arbor, Mich., while Frank is a proud, American business executive with residual issues of abandonment. The loss of a child can be daunting for any family, and it is clear how grief of this magnitude can slowly rip a family apart.\"And now they were two. Benny was gone. What was left behind was mockery -- objects and memories that mocked their earlier, smug happiness. Benny was gone, an airplane lost behind the clouds, but he left behind a trail of smoke a mile long:\" (Page 2)As this American couple struggles with the loss of their son, Ellie and Frank embark on a new life in India when Frank is transferred to a new HerbalSolutions factory. The distance between them had gaped wide by this point, and both hope that the experience will help them repair their relationship and bring them closer to one another. However, in rural India with its impoverished population, Frank and Ellie find that their values change and their current circumstances and grief dictate their reactions to one another, their servants, the local community, and other expatriates.\"Now she was trying to control the sway of her hips, trying hard to resist the tug of the pounding drums that were making her lose her inhibitions, making her want to dance manically, the way she used to in nightclubs when she was in her teens. But that was the beauty of the dandiya dance -- it celebrated the paradoxical joy of movement and restraint, of delirium within a structure. This was not about individual expression but about community.\" (Page 220)Readers will be absorbed by the local community and its traditions, the struggles of the Benton's servants, and the stark beauty of India. But what really makes this novel shine is the characters and their evolution from idealistic college students and young parents to a grief-stricken and dejected married couple in a foreign nation. The tension between Frank and Ellie is personified in the dichotomous views each character reveals to the reader about the Indian community from the lax work environment and labor disputes at Frank's factory to the deep-rooted sense of community and communion with nature shown through Ellie's interactions with individuals at a local clinic.The Weight of Heaven is more than a novel about grief; it is about how grief can distort perception and push people to make life-changing decisions that can broaden their horizons and transform them forever. Umrigar's prose is poetic and full of imagery that paints a vivid picture of India and its rural community and its city life in Mumbai/Bombay. Class differences, the struggles of American expatriates, grief, death, and marital woes are explored deftly in this novel, and it is clearly one of the best novels of 2010."}, {"userName": "Staci", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/177641-staci", "userReview": "I remember being blown away when I read Thrity's book The Space Between Us in 2010. I thought she made India come alive in my mind and as I became further engrossed in the story I could swear that I heard the sounds and the smells of the country too. That's how vivid and wonderful this author's writing is...with her sharply honed pen she draws the reader into the pages of her imagination and you find yourself not wanting to leave.The Weight of Heaven is another masterpiece by Umrigar and even though I was left with many conflicting emotions at the end of the book, I can honestly say that I loved it. I believed I experienced the entire gambit of emotions; extreme sadness, thrill of first love, anger, grief, hostility, bewilderment, indignation, happiness, joy, and too many more to list. I loved how the author told the story in segments because that gave the reader a chance to go back in time when life was really starting to get good for Frank and Ellie. The reader gets a glimpse into how very happy they truly were and then to see how they both plummeted into the tunnel of despair and grief after losing their only child. I started out feeling extreme sympathy and empathizing with both Frank and Ellie, but by the final page all of those connections and feelings were out the door. I was shocked to say the least and when I finally was able to close the book I just sat there in a stunned silence and really let everything soak in. Honestly, I'm still thinking about it a day later. Umrigar's story will haunt me for a while.Recommend?

It does not go well. Or, it goes pretty well for the wife, who makes friends, gets a useful job, and finds herself a place. The husband quickly gets involved in corruption (paying bribes to the government for various benefits), scandal (when labor demands at the factory he manages lead to a strike), more extreme corruption and scandal (when a leader of the strike is killed in police custody, which the husband may or may not be responsible for), a weird obsession with a local little boy whom he wants to replace his dead son, and eventually murder.I suppose he's meant to be a symbol of America (there's a lot of references to the contemporary Iraq war), which is fine, but I don't want to spend hundreds of pages focused on a dude who is so appallingly self-absorbed. He's not even bad particularly (at least not until the very end), just the very definition of privilege. It never occurs to him to see the differences between his own perspective and that of the others around him, or the consequences of his actions; all he does is whine about how hard things are for him. I'm not sure if Umrigar meant for him to be a Humbert Humbert sort of narrator, or if he was actually supposed to be sympathetic, but either way I hated him. The book was perfectly well-written and engaging, but it's hard to enjoy it when you can't stand the main character."}, {"userName": "Alice Meloy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2600421-alice-meloy", "userReview": "A novel of India that mixes in a bit of America in the form of a neurotic couple who can't get over their psychological problems.

Frank forms an attachment to the nine-year old son of their servants, and his obsession with helping the boy achieve a good life (American style) leads to some life-changing decisions.Umrigar is a good story teller, and she does a good job describing issues of cultures in conflict, but I found a few too many clichees and stereotypes to believe her story wholeheartedly, especially the rather dramatic ending."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/561943-karen", "userReview": "This book is heart wenching on many levels- first there are Frank and Ellie, who are recovering from the loss of a child; then there is the case of the American company Frank works for in India, wreaking havoc on the lives of native Indians in its typically naive American way; and lastly the Indian house servants Frank and Ellie have inherited, along with their young son...you see where this is going?

The Weight of Heaven demands your attention, shakes you up, then leaves you heavy with the weight of it.The Rest of It:This is a wonderful, meaty book. As you can imagine, the death of a child is a delicate subject. There\u2019s something incredibly tragic about losing a child. Even when the child is gone, his memory lives on in everyday things\u2026 a stray toy found under the couch, the shoe that lost its mate some time ago, etc. As Ellie and Frank cope with their devastating loss, it\u2019s obvious to Ellie that Frank is having a particularly hard time of it. When an opportunity comes up for Frank to transfer to Girbaug, India, he doesn\u2019t think much of it. The thought of leaving seems almost more painful but Ellie encourages him to accept the offer. Perhaps change is what they need.Frank\u2019s company puts them up in corporate housing which includes the use of a servant couple, named Edna and Prakash. Edna and Prakash live in a smaller house on the same property, with their son Ramesh, a very precocious nine-year-old. During their time in India, Frank befriends Ramesh and tutors him in math. Frank cherishes his moments with Ramesh, but Ellie worries that Frank is trying to replace the son he lost.Unfortunately, Ramesh\u2019s father, Prakash also thinks the same thing. Prakash resents Frank\u2019s attention towards his son. The extravagant gifts, the promises of a better education, basically, his help in general. Prakash, although a hard worker, resents having to work for a white man. This is obvious. However, Edna, Prakash\u2019s wife thinks the exact opposite. She gushes over Frank\u2019s generous offers. She sees Prakash as a failure and treats him as such. Cursing him and openly wishing that she\u2019d married someone else. As much as these two fight, there is love but frustration gets the best of them.In addition to Frank\u2019s relationship with Ramesh, there is also Ellie\u2019s desperate attempt to hold onto Frank. As the days pass, she feels that she is losing him. The only time that he seems happy is in the presence of Ramesh and this saddens Ellie. Instead of turning to her, he turns to Ramesh to ease his pain. However, Ellie loves Frank with all her heart and wants to see him happy, so she gives into his requests to be with Ramesh and often joins them in an attempt to see what Frank sees in this child. They decide to take Ramesh to Bombay, or Mumbai as it is now called for a weekend trip:\"Bombay. Such a deceptive word, so soft-sounding, like sponge cake in the mouth. Even the new name for the city, Mumbai, carries that round softness, so that a visitor is unprepared for the reality of this giant, bewildering city, which is an assault, a punch in the face.\"During this visit, even Ramesh is affected by the level of poverty. As they arrive at their 4-star hotel, Ramesh is overwhelmed by its opulence. Stunned. Speechless. Ellie regrets for a moment that they didn\u2019t consider his reaction to such an extravagant hotel. However, this is how it is throughout the story, Frank wants to give Ramesh what he cannot afford on his own, but in doing so, inadvertently asserts his money and power over the poorer people around him.Even at work, Frank is constantly at battle with the laborers. Trying to do what\u2019s right, but not fully understanding the impact of his company\u2019s actions. The constant class struggle, his overwhelming love of Ramesh, and the fragile love that he has for Ellie and hers for him. This story triggers a whirlwind of feelings, smells and sounds. At first I was devastated by their loss. Umrigar\u2019s writing is so rich and beautiful that I shed a tear once or twice while reading about Benny and how he died and the pain that Ellie and Frank felt afterward.Other times I was very angry. I was angry that Frank could not see what he was doing to Prakash. Turning a man\u2019s son away from his father is a wretched thing to do, regardless of how abrasive Prakash was at times. I was also angry at how oblivious he was to the working conditions of his laborers. This also filtered down to Ellie a bit, although my reaction to her was not nearly as severe. Ellie loves India and its people, but she too, chooses to bully them at times when she sees the need to do so. One moment that comes to mind is when she is trying to convince Prakash to allow Ramesh to take a trip with them. She threatens him, and he is forced to agree although it tears him apart to do so.As you can see, this novel evokes all sorts of emotion. I cried, I laughed I got angry. Through it all, I didn\u2019t want it to end. I lingered on each page to bask in its beauty. Although these characters are far from perfect, they are easy to relate to. Every time I picked the book up I was completely absorbed by the story.The Weight of Heaven is the perfect book club book. There\u2019s just so much to discuss. This is my first experience with Umrigar\u2019s work. Now I must go read her other books as this one was just wonderful. If you like a book to sweep you up and take you to another place, a book that really forces you to think about the world around you, then you will love this book.Source: A big \u2018thank you\u2019 to TLC Book Tours for asking me to be a part of this tour and for providing me with a review copy of the book."}, {"userName": "Shawna", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1451913-shawna", "userReview": "This book was better than \"If Today Be Sweet\" but still not as good as \"The Space Between Us.\" What made Umrigar's first book so good was that there was so much at stake, literally life and death, survival by inches. This book a mixture of the two prevous titles, you have an American couple living in India. They are escaping the death of their son and find solace in the country and the husband, Frank begins to fixate on their housekeepers' son. I had a hard time suspending my disbelief in places--where Frank seems so clueless as to what would be motivating the boy's father (Hello! Clearly he's is jealous that the rich white man who is lavishing his son with gifts is going to usurp his place in his son's heart. Knowing the father was an orphan, might you imagine that loss of family might be sore spot for him?!) I won't give away the final reversal of this book, but it is pretty stunning. Frank's reaction to it though, sort of falls flat. I think he is revealed to be the ogre, thoughtless, American imperialist pig, that all the locals suspected him of being all along.

And that's only considering the implications at the level of the individual characters. Add in the macro-level stuff about interactions between cultures and nations, and you've got an incredibly piercing commentary on people in contexts large and small."}, {"userName": "Aishah Ail", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17064460-aishah-ail", "userReview": "\u0643\u064a\u0641 \u0644\u0634\u062e\u0635 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u062e\u0645\u0633\u0645\u0626\u0629 \u0635\u0641\u062d\u0629 \u062f\u0648\u0646 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u064f\u0634\u0639\u0631\u0643 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0644 \u0648\u0644\u0648 \u0644\u0644\u062d\u0638\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f\u0629 .. \u0628\u0644 \u0623\u0628\u0639\u062f \u0645\u0646 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u064a\u0623\u062e\u0630\u0643 \u0645\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0642\u0639\u0643 \u0644\u064a\u0642\u062d\u0645\u0643 \u062a\u0641\u0627\u0635\u064a\u0644 \u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u064a\u062c\u0639\u0644\u0643 \u0636\u0645\u0646 \u062d\u0628\u0643\u062a\u0647 \u061f!!\u0648\u0637\u0623\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u062c\u0627\u0621 \u0644\u064a\u062e\u0628\u0631\u0646\u0627 \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u0644\u064a\u0633\u062a \u062e\u0641\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0648\u062c\u0645\u064a\u0644\u0629 \u0643\u0645\u0627 \u062a\u0648\u0642\u0639\u0646\u0627\u0647\u0627 \u0628\u0644 \u0623\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0643\u0645\u0627 \u0642\u0627\u0644 \u0641\u0631\u0627\u0646\u0643 \u0634\u0648 : \u0644\u064a\u0633\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u0633\u0648\u0649 \u0645\u062d\u064a\u0637\u064d \u0623\u0646\u0642\u0644\u0628 \u0631\u0623\u0633\u064b\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0639\u0642\u0628 . \u062a\u0633\u064a\u0631 \u0623\u063a\u0648\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0644\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0634\u0631\u064a \u0645\u0646 \u0642\u0645\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u0627\u062f\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0648\u0627\u0637\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0627\u0645\u062d\u0629 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0623\u0633 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0646\u0648\u0637..\u062b\u0631\u062a\u064a \u0627\u0648\u0645\u0631\u064a\u063a\u0627\u0631 \u062a\u0635\u0627\u062f\u0645 \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0642\u0627\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0647\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u062a\u0635\u0627\u062f\u0645 \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u0644\u0627\u0642\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0646\u062a\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0647\u0627 \u0648\u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062d\u062f\u0627\u062b \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u062a\u062c\u0628\u0631\u0646\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0643\u0633\u0631\u0647\u0627 .. \u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u062c\u0645\u064a\u0644\u0629"}, {"userName": "Abrar", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4251027-abrar", "userReview": "\u0644\u0627 \u0634\u064a \u064a\u0636\u0627\u0647\u064a \u0645\u0631\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u0645\u0627 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0641\u0642\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0632\u064a\u0632 \u060c\u060c \u062d\u062a\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0642\u062f \u0646\u0641\u0633\u0647 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0648\u063a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0631\u062d \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0641\u0633 \u0623\u0643\u062b\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u062d\u0634\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0648\u062d\u062f\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0637 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0643\u0631\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0641\u0631\u062d\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0628\u0643\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u0639\u0627 \u060c\u060c \u0648\u0625\u0646 \u0643\u0627\u0646\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062d\u062f\u0627\u062b \u0645\u0646 \u0646\u0633\u062c \u062e\u064a\u0627\u0644 \u0641\u0644\u0639\u0644 \u0641\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0628\u0639\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0634\u0627\u0631\u0643\u0629 \u0644\u0645\u062d\u0632\u0648\u0646\u064a \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0648\u0643\u0628 \u0639\u0632\u0627\u0626\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u062b\u0644 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0623\u0646 \u0646\u0646\u0638\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u0628\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0644\u0628 \u0648\u0646\u0634\u0643\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0646\u0639\u0645\u0629 \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f\u0646\u0627 \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0628\u0627\u0626\u0646\u0627"}, {"userName": "Marina", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17834354-marina", "userReview": "** Books 26 - 2018 **This books to accomplish Tsundoku Books Challenge 20183,8 of 5 stars!

I felt honored to have received an advance copy of her new book: The Weight of Heaven, which is scheduled for release on April 14th, 2009, by Harper Collins.In her new novel we meet Frank and Ellie Benton, a grief stricken couple from Ann Arbor, Michigan, who have just lost their seven year old son Benny, after a short illness. Unable to cope with this horrific loss, Frank accepts a new assignment running a factory, Herbal Solutions, in Girbaug, India, a coastal village near Bombay.Unfortunately, the factory and its Third World workers are in the midst of a labor dispute over low wages. Frank calls the workers \u201clazy\u201d, and his wife sees the workers as justified. Ellie sides with the workers, suggesting that Frank give them a few \u201crupees\u201d to make them feel like they \u201cwon\u201d. Even in India, Frank and Ellie are conflicted. Frank has difficulties understanding why his workers don\u2019t act like his workers did in America. This additional conflict only adds to the pain he is still experiencing in India over the loss of his son. Ellie on the other hand sees her new surroundings as an opportunity to help the less fortunate women in the village (she is a psychologist/therapist), and believes there is so much to teach these poor women that she sees at a local health clinic. She is determined to not let grief define her life, because she believes her son would not have wanted that.Frank before long begins to find some comfort tutoring Ramesh, the young son of the couple\u2019s housekeeper. The boy is very bright and eager to learn. Before long, his interest in helping the boy becomes an obsession and new conflicts arise between Frank and Prakash, the boy\u2019s resentful, bitter, father. Frank will do anything to keep that bright and personable boy close by, no matter what it takes.The Weight of Heaven is a hauntingly beautiful story about cultural divides and misunderstandings. It is a story about loss and working through grief, and one of those rare books that forces you as the reader to take stock of your life, and to think about the things that really matter most. The ending is shocking, but in some strange way--- wonderful. I am happy to say that this is one of those rare books, that left an imprint with me long after the final page was turned. There are so many beautiful passages that I found myself reading over and over again; a true gem.

It was always at the bottom of my to-read pile but it relentlessly stared at me every time I'd turn on my kindle.So I finally picked it up last month because I was so darn bored at I needed to read something. Much to my surprise, I devoured major chunks of it every time I'd get a moment to myself. I found myself really connecting with the characters who by the way are so rich.The main characters, Frank and Ellie Benton have recently lost their only son and are desperate to get away from the everyday grunt of their lives in Anne Arbour, where everyone and everything reminds them of him.Most of the novel takes place in Girbaug, a tiny village outside Bombay where Frank Benton is posted by Herbal Solutions, a pharmaceutical company that has won the bid to procure the the Girbal trees with it's diabetes healing properties, that originally belonged to the villagers. They are met with vehement opposition from the villagers who believe that these trees belong to them and their ancestors, and a series of events taken place in which the company suffers a blow. Frank is still hurting from the death of his son and takes great interest in the servant's boy Ramesh much to his wife's disagreement. His wife on the other hand, a practicing therapist, spends her days running a clinic counselling the village women. Franks love for the boy intensifies through the course of the story and he decides to take the boy back to America, where he believes he will be able to give him a better life away from the dysfunctional life he has always known. His zeal grows to the extent that nothing can come in between him and his need to have the boy all to himself, and he decides to take matters into his own hand and that just throws everything out the window.The above is just a very brief explanation of what takes place in the book, and I will leave it to that for fear of revealing too much."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3356446-carol", "userReview": "As a special treat for myself, I pulled this book off my shelf, I love Thrity Umrigar's books and The Weight of Heaven turned out to be an emotional experience. I did shed some tears and also got very angry.Frank and Ellie Benton, living in Ann Arbor, Michigan lost their only child, Benny, to meningococcal infection. Frank is a business man for a company that sells medical products and Ellie is a therapist. When their boy dies, it brings havoc to their marriage. Frank blames Ellie for taking a short break from her sixteen hour stint of caring for their very sick son. His temperature was better before she collapsed from exhaustion and he was half way around the world on business. Ellie wants an escape from the constant grief and a new start that might help them to repair their marriage. She pushes hard for the move when Frank gets an offer from his company to manage a factory in Girbang, India. He didn\u2019t like the idea at first but later on, he relents.They meet Ramesh who was a bit older than Benny and lives in a small shack that came with the property that they were staying. Ramesh\u2019s father, Prakash does the cooking and his mother, Edna does the cleaning for the Benton\u2019s. Ramesh is a delightful, intelligent but limited in education and social experience. Frank quickly becomes attached to him. Ellie finds comfort with her new friends.This book took a big turn about half way through. I was shocked and surprised at what happened. India\u2019s class system is very present and Ellie is shocked at how poor the really poor are in India. There is spirituality, a rich appreciation of the cultural divide between the Western and India and a great deal of emotional torment in this story. The author, Thirty Umrigar is a master at creating emotionally powerful scenes and characters that are real and unforgettable.I highly recommend this book to all who want understand the grieving process and want to learn more about India."}, {"userName": "Julia", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1532455-julia", "userReview": "Just a week ago, I read my first Thrity Umrigar novel and loved it. (The World we Found) So, I deliberately sought out another of her books. I was not disappointed with this novel. I am kind of in awe of this author, how she can draw me into the lives of her characters and tugged on my emotions to the point that I had tears running down my face numerous times. Once when I was at the gym on a stationary bike I was reading and crying. Another time I brushed away tears at my favourite Second Cup coffee shop as I sipped and read in a corner. The book tells the story of Frank & Ellie a young couple who have recently lost their only child suddenly to menengitis. They are devastated. When Frank's company asks him if he would want to re-locate to their plant in India, Frank accepts the offer thinking he & Ellie could make a fresh start and heal from their terrible loss.Ellie quickly learns to love India, its people and culture. Frank has a harder time and has an attitude of impatience and superiority among the local people. Frank soon becomes very attached to the young boy, Ramesh who is the son of their house servants. He becomes obsessed with this boy, spending alot of time with him, and wanting to give him things and opportunities that he might not otherwise have. This sounds good, but it creates alot of tension between him and Ramesh's father who see's his son being lured away by this wealthy, powerful and arrogant American. Both men become desperate for the love and attention of this boy and will not listen to any reasoning. In this desperation, things spiral out of control. The book is very intense throughout. It is heavy with grief and struggle. I found it hard to put down.

Frank and Ellie\u2019s only son, seven-year old Benny, has died from meningitis. Frank was away for work during the sudden illness and he blames Ellie for Benny\u2019s death. After Frank is offered a job in India, the two decided to take the job in Girbaug and start life anew. While in Girbaug, Frank befriends a young boy, Ramesh that is the son of the servants at their home. Ramesh is very smart and at first Frank is helping Ramesh with his homework, and then he is calling him his son. Ellie is not keen on their relationship and also doesn\u2019t like how Frank\u2019s work treats the local people of Girbaug. Ramesh\u2019s father does not appreciate Frank trying to usurp his place. It causes much tension for all concerned and the book leads to a shocking conclusion.I enjoyed the story (although it made me cry at times), but even more, I enjoyed Umrigar\u2019s fabulous use of language. One example of this is \u201cEllie felt she had a glimpse of what it meant to be a man who was married to a cloud \u2013 ever-shifting, hard to pin down, filtering light but also holding rain.\u201d I liked the bonus features that were at the end of the novel as well and think it would be a fabulous for a book club read. I also really enjoyed that part of the novel was set in Ann Arbor, in my home state of Michigan. The many Michigan references always gave me a smile.Overall The Weight of Heaven was an engrossing drama filled with wonderful writing that has me wanting to check out Umrigar\u2019s other novels.I read The Weight of Heaven as part of the TLC Book Tour.My review of this novel was orignally posted on my blog at: http://lauragerold.blogspot.com/2012/..."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1425835-michael", "userReview": "Thrity Umrigar's latest novel The Weight of Heaven is a dramatic work exploring the effects of grief on a couple who has it all. From the opening pages when we meet Frank and Ellie, we are plunged into the grief over the loss of their son Benny. The couple are in such despair, with their marriage fraying, that they decide to move to India when Frank is offered a position running a multinational corporation there. They hope that without the constant reminders of Benny, they will be able to find each other again, and for Ellie, the healing process does seem to catch on. Frank too finds a new focus, in the form of Ramesh, the son of their housekeepers who live in a shack on the grounds of their home. As the book progresses we see Frank and Ellie's life in India, their courtship years earlier, and the devastating moment of Benny's death before slowly morphing into a moral thriller where we know things are not going to end well but are compelled to keep reading.Umrigar writing capturing moments heart-rending grief and exquisite beauty with equal power. She tempers both Frank and Ellie's extreme moments with rational thought, even as they might be unraveling. She touches on class issues in India and the influence of the global multinationals, exploring the complexity of the situation without making issues black and white. It's a dense book that reads like a thriller with a slow build and an explosive payoff.

Once again, it gripped my emotions and didn't let go. I was surprised at the beginning to find that it revolves around a Caucasian couple, Frank and Ellie Benton, but once the couple moved to India I could see why she chose to tell the novel from their points of view. Their move to India was precipitated by the death of their only child, 7-year-old Benny. When Frank's company offered him a transfer to India, he and Ellie thought it might help to heal the pain they were suffering from the loss of their son. Once in India, we see the clash of cultures. Frank's company, HerbalSolutions, does not treat its Indian workers well and is intensely disliked by many members of the community. There is a clash between Frank and the couple who cook and clean for the Bentons. Their 9-year-old son, Ramesh, has charmed Frank and Ellie, and Frank is going a bit too far in showering the boy with attention and with gifts his parents could only afford in their dreams. The grief these two people felt over the loss of their son was palpable. I wonder if Ms. Umrigar could write some of those passages and not be moved to tears herself. They were so real that I am wondering if she might have lost a child, but I hope she has not.

India occupies only 2.4% of the world's land area and supports over 15% of the world's population. Umrigar delivers a strong political message involving the \"ugly American\" image when Frank opens an out-sourced business that collides with Indian values.

Ms Umrigar tells a fascinating story about how one family deals with one of the most difficult life experiences - the death of a child. The story is well written and seems possible even when it was was most bizarre.One of the topics that Umrigar touches on in this book is lost possibilities. The death of someone means they miss all the future parts of their lives. This seems a bit obvious as I write this down, but when I read her passages on possibilities, I was touched. I don't think I had seen a child's death in that way. This was important to the arc that the book follows, but also to my view of the world. I have not had to deal with the death of a child, thank goodness. I felt like Umrigar gave me a window into that grief-filled world.I recommend this book to readers of contemporary fiction, to people interested in cultural conflict and to those who are interested in how people might deal with love and death."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3644103-linda", "userReview": "I've not read books by Thrity Umrigar before. This was recommended by a friend who is a librarian. The book was very deep and well-written, holding my interest even late at night. An American couple, Frank and Ellie, move to India, where Frank works in a company called \"Herbal Solutions\". After having lost their only son to illness, Frank befriends a young Indian boy whose parents work in their household. The attachment of Frank to the boy, Ramesh, becomes too strong, leading to antagonisms all around - between Frank and his wife, between Frank the the parents of Ramesh. In addition, the parents are caught in their own struggles of an arranged marriage, the inability to rise economically, and the lack of fulfillment of their own dreams. The story becomes darker as it progresses, with Frank increasingly obsessed with bringing Ramesh to America. There are a number of psychological and political themes in the book. The author provides a great deal of insight into the politics and economic themes in Indian life today, with economic domination of poor people by large multi-national corporations, the elites versus the underclasses in India. Some books can easily be forgotten, but I will always remember the story and messages of this book."}, {"userName": "Louise", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2143983-louise", "userReview": "I've read all of Thrity Umrigar's previous novels and found them to be extremely enjoyable and hard to put down...this one was no different.

It must have been around 10 years ago. But that book left such an impact and a warm longingness for more of her words and writings. I remembered how I had felt while reading her book, therefore I greedily picked this one up wanting to once again feel the humanness in her stories and the raw emotions she manages to etch in every one of her characters. She is a master in her craft. Of storytelling and life relating. There was so much sorrow packed into this one book. So much loss which filled the 300 odd pages of it. And not just one person\u2019s loss. There was loss for everyone here. Of course there was Frank\u2019s loss , right from the start to the end. One cannot deny his share of grief was comparatively more. More than Ellie\u2019s, his loving lovely wife , more than Prakash\u2019s , the reluctant poor father caught up between duty and devotion. Frank\u2019s sorrow was deeper and greater. But that was also because he loved more. He lost more. Early on in life. He felt more. He wanted more. He accepted less. He expected more. He resolved less. In his mind and his heart, he could not come to terms of his life\u2019s worse tragedy. Whereas Ellie dealt with the same tragedy with grace and quiet acceptance. The 5 part book delves on the life of husband and wife Frank and Ellie who move from , Ann Arbor, America to a small village in India , called Girbaug. They take the move to run away from the demons and memories of the recent tragic loss in their lives. Also to try to reignite their once loving and emotionally close relationship. At first, it seemed like the right move. But another relationship entered their lives and attachments were quickly formed with Ramesh, the son of their poor househelpers and cook. Constantly sozzled Prakesh and his sharp tongued wife, Edna. Ramesh became the joy in Frank\u2019s life. His purpose, his reason of existence. His ersatz for all the lack and loss of his otherwise tragic life. He began to weave dreams and aspirations for Ramesh. Frank saw in that boy, all the possibilities of greatness and accomplishments which any father figure would look and find in his son. Frank cultivated this particular and odd relationship with Ramesh , teaching him , tutoring him , coaching him soccer and generally offering him an experience of a different world and world view than the one he had as a boy from the less privileged background presently. Ellie on the other hand dealt with her loss not by building new relationship to off set the pain of loss of the previous one, but instead to use her knowledge of psychology and her experience of pain and loss to help and aid other people to cope with theirs. She never tried running away from her grief. Instead she choose to heal from it slowly and gradually just as she was healing others around her. The twist and turns of their story takes many a rugged path. Silent reproach in a gaze of grudge enters Frank\u2019s and Ellie\u2019s Life. Omission of truths and half lies makes their presence in their lives until everything , I mean everything is lost beyond redemption. That is where sorrow cut deep into my heart. I felt its weight. By the time I finished the book I felt emotionally weak by the weight and knowledge of heaven and how much life can take away more than it gives. Without mercy. Without witnesses. If you have ever experienced loss in life, the kind of intense , heartbreaking, earth shattering, irrecoverable, unbearable loss in life, read this book,. It will mirror that loss and perhaps makes sense that loss happens even to the best of us. Even to the most privileged ones. Even to the most entitled ones on earth. Perhaps their loss is even greater and deeper. There is a paragraph in the last part of the book which so beautifully encapsulates Frank\u2019s eventual impression of life and loss: \"The sun was God. Life giving but mercurial , sometimes soft and mellow , sometimes fiery and distant. Wasn't everything controlled by the sun- the seasons ,the weather, the vegetation, the animal Kingdom? And yet what a mystery. The beautiful star that affected every single life form on earth chose to remain hidden from us. And why wouldn't it? Why would it bother with an army of gnats? No wonder Icarus got his wings burned by flying too close to it. Flying in the face of God. Shadow and light. All the things that human beings took personally -the ups and downs of personal fortunes ,the roller coaster rife through life's vagaries ,was just a damn light show. When the sun went down, the world went dark. Every toddler knew this. But surely this cycle of dawn and dusk, the strictest law governing the universe, also govern individual lives? What we humans called fate was simple physics, a matter of degrees and positioning: Sometimes the sun turned a benevolent eye onto a lucky mortal and showered him in its light, so that he was blessed, golden, untouchable. And then , it moved a few inches gracing another with its attention, giving that person hid moment in the sun, leaving the first person to feel the coldness of its shadow. How easily we accepted the rotation of the earth around the sun, the dissolving of day into night , the partitioning of the globe between darkness and light. And yet how we resisted the fact that this interplay between darkness and dawn also ruled each person's life.Perhaps, Frank thought, we mistook the sun's consistency ,it's reliability , it's unfailing rise in the east, for a kind of love. But really the hallmark of the sun was its indifference to us. Our prayers, our piety, did not disturb it in the least. It didn't care if it ruined our picnics or weddings or even our lives. Tossing in his bed, Frank felt liberated by this thought. It was foolishness , conceit, this belief in a personal god, an indication of our puniness and weakness\".- The Weight of Heaven by Thrity Umrighar .(04-10-17@6.25pm)"}, {"userName": "Darci", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1308232-darci", "userReview": "OH MY GOODNESS. This book was so good I almost gave it 5 stars. I really, really like this author, and after I read one book by her I took a break so it wasn't ruined by the next one, in case I didn't like it as well. This was so good.The story is really great... with a few details that kind of bugged me. Ellie and Frank are living in India while Frank works for an American company. They live in a company house, complete with a servant-family living in the shack behind them. The detail that bugged me a bit was that they are both pretty lovestruck with the young son of their servants, which wouldn't be so bothersome except that they did odd things. They invite the young boy to their house for Christmas dinner, but not the parents... they take the boy to the big city, knowing that although his parents object, they can't really do anything about it because of their position as house servants. It's a little weird, and feels somewhat un-American. But the story itself is really complicated and good... and the end! Rips your heart out!
