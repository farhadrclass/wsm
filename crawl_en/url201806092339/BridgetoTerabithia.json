When I read it again later in life, aloud to my younger brother and sister ages 10 and 12, I was choking back tears to keep reading aloud, and they were crying. If you've never read it (or, I suppose now, seen the movie) beware, this review is a spoiler! What I have learned from this book is that our assumptions about children and what is \"appropriate\" for them are seriously flawed. We assume they need color, fantasy, and bling, and that they can't deal with \"hard\" topics like death and, oh, speaking of that, life. Kids are people too. And they do understand and can deal with hard topics in many ways better than us adults, who have learned to choke back the tears instead of actually crying. When I was a kid going to my secret hideouts, I wasn't just playing, I was escaping. If kids don't understand real life, then why do they run from it, then, as in this book (and in real life) gain life-altering skills while \"away\" and come back stronger? I may choke back tears now, but when I was 10, I went to my secret hideouts to cry and deal with things in my own way, in my own world, just like Leslie and Jesse do in Terabithia."}, {"userName": "Whitney Atkinson", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14457130-whitney-atkinson", "userReview": "You would think that even after seeing the movie and knowing how this ends I wouldn't cry, but here I am. This book was very enjoyable! I can't remember if I read it as a kid, but it was definitely worth reading now that I'm older.The writing is pretty and gives you a very country-vibe with vibrant imagery and cozy settings, but I felt like the characters lacked a lot of description. Maybe it\u2019s a children\u2019s book and i\u2019m not used to the shorter pace, but it felt like a lot more needed to be fleshed out. The relationships between the characters. Day-to-day activities. Dialogue scenes. It all just happened very quickly and it was hard to gauge how much time was actually passing, and it felt like the characters and plot were progressing faster than they probably actually were.I really need to pick up more children\u2019s classics because reading a book written and presumably set in the 70s was so captivating! References to the Vietnam war and the fearlessness about talking about religion and God was just something I rarely see today, and adding in details so particular to the time period almost 50 years ago now was just very cool! I couldn\u2019t get the movie out of my head when I read this, even though I haven\u2019t seen the movie in years. Baby josh hutcherson is so precious that I think it added a spark to the book just seeing his face in my mind. However, comparing the book to the movie was a little bit detrimental because I think I liked the movie a little more? Just because it took more time to flesh out the characters and add detail to the world of Terabithia, whereas in the book Terabithia was, ironically, rather underexplained.I loved how it described Jess as having a nervous gut. There were references to Jess having anxiety in this and i\u2019m glad it wasn\u2019t portrayed as something like HE NEEDS TO MAN UP! HE\u2019S AFRAID OF SWIMMING AND HIS DAD PUTS A LOT OF PRESSURE ON HIM TO BE PERFECT, HE SHOULD BE THE MAN OF THE FAMILY! Instead it\u2019s approached as if fear and shyness is natural and you need to work through it organically, and I thought that was really beautiful and encouraging."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2006", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5-elizabeth", "userReview": "Oh I loved this book too!

It was part of what I now consider to be my fourth grade teacher's reign of terror - she read Where the Red Fern Grows and Bridge to Terabithia out loud to us (and those are just the books I was in her class for), and I seriously think she did it for the days when, inevitably, the entire class would spend the afternoon weeping at our desks.That said, though - and it needed to be said - this is a good book; it was so engaging to me at that age that I got it from the library after the first day she read it to us and finished it by myself later that night. (Admittedly, this was not uncommon behavior for me. I did not like reading at other people's paces.) Of course, this meant I got to cry twice, and also spend the intervening time trying not to cry because I knew what was coming. The characters are engaging. The story is memorable even 25 years later.

I loved to read it!I don't know if you ever watch the film from 2007, if you do, but you haven't read the book, I can tell you that the movie is a good adaptation BUT it can mislead you in the \"fantasy\" factor, even I used that label in my review but only because, at this moment, I don't have a better label to describe the book in a fair way.I tell you all that since in the film, they gave a lot of emphasis and screen time to all \"those magic creatures\", however, they don't exist, in the book, the kids are really clear on that, they are playing sure, but they don't start to watch magic creatures from the thin air, they just using something called \"imagination\".I tell you that too, just to make you understand that if you want to read this book expecting something in the style of Harry Potter or Narnia, you will get a real disappointment, BUT if you are looking to read an amazing, coming-to-age story, you will read one of the best books in that area, genre and/or topic.Due to clumsy reasons, this great book has been banned in many libraries. What I can tell you is that the kids here talk and think in a very real and honest way, so I don't think that can be a good reason to ban this book.This is a truly great novel about growing, about maturing, about the impossibility of controlling life and that you have to treasure each moment that you are living since you never know when something will change forever.Also, you won't understand the reason for the title of this book until you read it, but please, don't do any research or investigation, since the impact of the story depends of that you don't know anything ahead.This is a short book, just read it and it will live in your heart forever."}, {"userName": "Khanh, first of her name, mother of bunnies", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4527753-khanh-first-of-her-name-mother-of-bunnies", "userReview": "Even when I was 12, I thought this was a crap book.What's with all the hype?

Okay, so I read this YEARS ago. Maybe when I was 14? I saw the movie first and that absolutely ruined me. I think this is about my 3rd reread, which proves this book is timeless. As well as, you know, heart ripping. I thought I'd be okay reading this. BUT I WASN'T. I JUST WAS NOT. I JUST ABOUT CHOKED UP WHEN THE DAD SAID:\"Lord, boy, don't be a fool. God ain't gonna send any little girls to hell.I don't know why. But I really just started crying there. This book is amazing for it's little lines that just hit home so powerfully. It's a few sentences and -- BOOM -- it's gotten under your skin and into your soul.Also, I never really cared about \"good writing\" before now, but...THIS IS SERIOUSLY GOOD WRITING. Sure there are chapters were it's mostly \"told\" what's happened without actual scenes. But the dialogue?! It's perfection and natural, but not weighted down with unnecessaries or dialogue tags. Omg, it's just beautiful. And the story flows so perfectly. There are TWO foreshadows to the ending, which I only noticed now of course. And, towards the end, I just started feeling outright SICK because I knew what was coming. I noticed other things, being an adult reading this, that I wouldn't have picked up on originally. Like: + There's quite a bit of \"fat shaming\" here. Both Janice Avery (the school bully) and one of Jess' sisters get teased about being fat. It was sad and I felt uncomfortable, particularly when no one felt bad for doing this. + When the teacher reads out Leslie's essay she says \"this is an unusual hobby for a girl\"...which sort of tainted the chapter for me. + The whole Ms. Edmunds taking Jess to the city for the day was...weird. I mean, logically? She was just being nice. But you'd never get away iwth that in a million years these days. Especially since Ms. Edmunds didn't even talk to his parents (I know, I know, she told him to get permission and it was fine...but you know what I MEAN).I'm not saying these are heinous faults. I think they more just colour the book from the era it was written in. And if a book can still be timeless through all this? Then just GIVE IT A MILLION STICKERS AND HUG IT. Or slap it. Because it made me cry, dangit.I love the themes of uncanny friendship, of Jess feeling under-appreciated and overlooked and like a fish out of water in his family, and of being bullied and turning into the bullies. There is literally so much packed into this book. And of course, the gut-wrenching happenings of Leslie Burke.Also the ending made me freaking sob again. Darn this book. When Jess took May Belle into Terabithia? ERMAGERD. I CANNOT RIGHT NOW. (Aren't I supposed to be the mature reasonable adult here? Hand me the tissue box.)This book is a warm, soulful classic that broke me and I hate it but I love it. And that's all I'm gonna say."}, {"userName": "Kirk", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4558389-kirk", "userReview": "There are only two books that have made me cry. Granted, I was in sixth grade when I read this for the first time. But like most books I review on Goodreads, I sat down to read this again before posting my review. My sentiments about Bridge to Terabithia haven't changed much.I don't remember a lot from my pre-teen years. Little fragments crop up from time to time when I see an old commercial on Youtube or I play an 8-bit classic on my Wii. This book I remember. And as I re-read it I started recalling the circumstances that surrounded my initial reading of this book. I remember the girl I had a crush on who sat behind me in class. I remember growing my hair out and listening to Iron Maiden, experimenting with image, stripping away those last external indicators of child-like innocence and trying to be more \"grown up.\" Then I remember crying in my closet near the end of this book. Years later I have a career, a daughter, a wife. I still listen to Iron Maiden, but I don't wear the oversized metal shirts like I used to, and my hair is cut short most of the time. I don't have to try to be an adult anymore. What I was pushing back then I reflect on as an inevitable development now. Now I find myself retracing my steps, trying to go back to that time in my life, but like Rita Dove observes in her poem \"Driving Through,\" it isn't always as easy or clear cut as we hope it to be. I'm a different person now, at least that's what I told myself when I started reading this book again a few years ago. How strange that sometimes drawing a connection between the person we were and the person we become happens inadvertently, at the most unexpected moments, when we spend half of our lives trying so hard to move forward and half of lives trying so hard to go back. So there I sat, more than a decade later, with the same emotional reaction I had as a child telling me to stop reading, and nostalgia and the comforting memory of childhood ebbing me back towards youth."}, {"userName": "Jon", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1037037-jon", "userReview": "Bridge to Terabithia is a staple of many middle school literary curriculums; however, it is one of the most challenged books in school systems across the country. Opponents of this book preposterously assert that it has references to witchcraft and Satanism. I read this book in 5th grade and gathered no references to the use of magic at all. The book involves two children having imaginary adventures in the imaginary land of Terabithia. Such imaginary games are common for children. Yet some assert that Katherine Patterson\u2019s writing about such common activities is a reference to witchcraft. The book is an amazing piece of children\u2019s literature and one of the only pieces from fifth and sixth grade a number of my peers remember reading. It stood out to us. We remembered it and used it to become better writers and thinkers. It helped us transition to more complex books. Educators and teachers should advocate strongly for this book to be read in class. \tPatterson instills into this book many important thematic elements of a great story in a manner that younger students will be able to identify with some thought on the book. Foreshadowing, character development, symbolism, and a clear connected thread and purpose are present throughout the whole story as Jess makes friends with the new girl Leslie, learns important lessons from her that help him to become more confident, and then is forced to say goodbye when she dies entering their imaginary land of Terabithia. \tTo an older reader, the foreshadowing of Leslie\u2019s death is a little heavy-handed, but in no way poorly presented to a younger audience. \u201cSometimes it seemed to him that his life was as delicate as a dandelion. One little puff from any direction and it was blown to bits\u201d (Paterson, 99). When May Belle becomes horrified of Leslie\u2019s independent thoughts on the authenticity of the Bible, she exclaims, \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen if you die?\u201d (Paterson 109). Paterson makes the readers contemplate Leslie\u2019s death briefly and insincerely several times before forcing them to do it for real. When she dies, they must revisit those thoughts they\u2019d only touched on. \u201cThe Perkins place was one of those ratty old country houses you moved into because you had no decent place to go and moved out as quickly as you could\u201d (Paterson 10). If the reader takes this passage seriously, they must know that the Burkes will leave Jess, in one way or another. After Leslie\u2019s death the Burkes do leave. \u201cNo one ever stayed in the old Perkins place\u201d (Paterson 161). As a result of this heavy foreshadowing, the books overall tone adopts one of reflection, as opposed to simple telling, a story that had to be told, that demanded to be told. Patterson\u2019s accomplishment here is powerful to a child\u2019s appreciation of literature and their ability to deceiver more complex literature later. \tAnother interesting literary event that young readers can benefit from analyzing is Jess\u2019s evolution as a person, especially with regard to Terabithia\u2019s changes. It was Leslie who had taken him from the cow pasture into Terabithia and turned him into a king. He had thought that was it. Wasn\u2019t king the best you could be? Now it occurred to him that perhaps Terabithia was like a castle where you came to be knighted. After you stayed for a while and grew strong you had to move on. For hadn\u2019t Leslie, even in Terabithia, tried to push back the walls of his mind and make him see beyond to the shining world-huge and terrible and beautiful and very fragile?...Now it was time for him to move out (Paterson 160). Jess is simply not the same person he was at the beginning of the book and what logically follows is that Terabithia is not the same place to him that it was. Concurrently, he must move out. A heavy handed indication of Jess\u2019s transition occurs with his father near the entrance to Terabithia. His father begins, \u201c\u2018Hell ain\u2019t it?\u2019 It was the kind of thing Jess could hear his father saying to another man. He found it strangely comforting, and it made him bold.\u201d (Paterson 148). In the beginning, Jess\u2019 father would barely speak a word to him. Jess relationship with his father has changed as well. On the same note, children can benefit from seeing the method for entering Terabithia changing with Jess and with Terabithia\u2019s significance to Jess. In the beginning, entering Terabithia involves a scary trip swinging across a river on a rope. In the end, Jess builds a bridge to Terabithia, changing one of its key characteristics and symbolizing the increased ease Jess has with accessing what he learned from Terabithia. In the end, Jess seeks to open Terabithia\u2019s lessons to his younger sister, Joyce Ann. \u201cAnd when he finished, he put flowers in [Joyce Ann\u2019s] hair and led her across the bridge-the great bridge into Terabithia-which might look to someone with no magic in them like a few planks across a nearly dry gully\u2026\u201d Jess leads Joyce Ann into this kingdom of learning and evolution, a confident adolescent, just as the confident Leslie had done for him once. He has learned from Leslie, about himself and his insecurities, and about life, and can share these lessons with Joyce Ann. \tAlso valuable as classroom discussion is what parallels, if any, Leslie has with Jesus. Certainly a Christ archetype is present in many works and discussion of such can benefit students. As with so many literary elements, it is hard to say whether the author intended this parallel, but that idea is unimportant except to express it to the students. Leslie makes ambiguous comments at the beginning of the book about how she likes and dislikes the country. Jess is talking to her about her old home. \u201cI really miss it.\u201d She replies. \u201cYou must hate it here\u201d (Patterson 41) he says. She says she does. \u201cI wanted to come too\u201d (Paterson 42) she says, talking of her parents\u2019 decision to move. Her contradicting sentiments parallel Jesus\u2019 experience in the garden of Gethsemane, where he asks god to save him from his impending crucifixion, but exclaims truly that he is glad to do it if it is God\u2019s will. One could argue that her playing with the boys and running faster than them is analogous to Jesus\u2019 miracles. Her challenging people\u2019s interpretations of the Bible is another possible parallel. Also, Jess describes her arrival as \u201cprobably the biggest thing in his life\u201d (Paterson 10). She dies as a result of coming, as a result of ultimately helping Jess transition from an insecure introspective adolescent into a more confident man. This is a weaker thematic element, and perhaps Paterson did not intend it, but its presence is something that may be discussed briefly in the classroom. \tSomeone unfamiliar with this book may think that these elements are too complex for younger readers; however, Paterson presents them expertly to a younger audience while engaging the students with a character they can relate to, Jess. He is constantly introspective, thinking not only about an issue, but on his thoughts on the issue too. He frequently wonders why he is thinking that way, leading him deeper and deeper into his mind. He has feelings for Ms. Edmund that he does not yet understand as well. The beginning of the book is hard focused on portraying Jess as having external suffering as well \u201cEver since he\u2019d been in first grade he\u2019d been that \u201c \u2018crazy little kid that draws all the time\u2019\u201d (Paterson 4). The number of sentences used to portray this manner of suffering almost rivals his introspective lamentations, and establishes a character that many confused early adolescents can not help but identify with and cheer on. If this element commands girls\u2019 attentions less, then Leslie\u2019s charisma is more than enough to bridge the gap. The use of swear words helps to prevent children from resenting the book and closing their minds to it simply because children at that age are told not to swear. This book swears? Wow, that must be cool. I want to read on. And they do. And more importantly, they listen to what they are reading. \tBridge to Terabithia is not a book of separate literary elements, but rather elements that play beautifully and deftly together to create a complete literary work, one to help children transition to more complex literature and to make them think of new ideas. It should be staple of every early middle school English education regardless of objections that may be voiced against it. If this book is not on your child\u2019s curriculum, it is worth your time to ask why and challenge such a decision. Afterwards, you and your child should read it together. You\u2019ll both enjoy it."}, {"userName": "Carmine", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43396096-carmine", "userReview": "Ti ricordi di quando eravamo re e regina del regno oltre il fiume?

I gave this book five stars, here's why:It is absolutely incredible that a writer can invent a character, and bring him to life so convincingly that we find some of our deepest emotions aroused when we read black words on a white page. I was amazed at how deeply I felt towards some the characters in this book...fictional characters!Character development is absolutely masterful in Bridge to Terabithia. It is easy to identify with both Jess Aarons and Leslie Burke. They not only forge a friendship with each other that is profound, uplifting, and edifying - but they also forge that same friendship with you. I particularly enjoyed Jess's character - full of childlike reason, error, and love. I sometimes felt like he was my own child. It feels good to read him - especially within the last fifty pages. The majority of the plot is gentle and accents the beauty of childhood, often embellishing it with innocent humor. While nothing is unimportant or uninteresting, the author very skillfully tells the story in such a way that it feels like \"everyday life\". Any suspense is usually trivial and very scarce, but the story remains very compelling and thoroughly enjoyable to read. (I have to say that a good writer should be able to tell a gripping story without the sometimes garish and seemingly mandatory thrill of suspense found so much in fiction.)It seems heartless and depraved to say that I'm glad Kathrine Paterson and her son David were able to experience what they did (I can't think of a better way to say that without giving anything away.) - but I think Paterson gained some beautiful insight through that experience that she has used to help others, especially children - rather artfully I might add.I need to mention one thing I wasn't particularly fond of. Janice Avery (a minor character) reveals to her friends that her father beats her - \"the kind of beating they send you to jail for\" says Leslie. And at the advice of Leslie, Janice decides to pretend that her father is innocent, and that her friends are just spreading \"rumors\" all over school. The author says something like \"kids shouldn't ever betray their parents, and that's just what Janice Avery had done.\" See the contradiction? \"Honour thy father and thy mother\" - \"Domestic abuse is wrong, no matter what\". I don't think this kind of conflict belongs in a children's novel, even as a very minor vehicle for plot development. I wish the author had omitted that, or at least found an acceptable solution.Notwithstanding its faults, I love this book.

It seems not to have made much impression on me however, and considering I often read books above my age group, it might have been for that reason. I say this because I am not rating it low for traumatizing me as a kid, but because rereading it as an adult makes me annoyed at how a book with so many negative messages could win a Newberry.Lets run down a few of them.1. The sheer shallowness of Jesse's sisters as characters. It borders on misogyny, and I don't accuse books of that lightly. The two older sisters are thoughtless and often detestable, including after the big twist. May Belle is portrayed more sympathetically as just being kind of a puppy dog, but is still annoying and is the character used to talk about hell. 2. The weird attitudes on violence. One cringe-worthy passage is when Jesse, grieving over Leslie, slugs May Belle hard in the face because she asked if he saw her laid out. He feels bad about it, but good lord, could you imagine that today? Another is how the school girl bully is weeping not so much over being abused, and hardcore, but the other kids knowing it and cruelly teasing her about it. And how kids need to defend parents who abuse.\"There was a rule at Lark creek, more important than anything Mr. Turner made up or fussed about. That was the rule that you never nuxed up troubles at home with life at school...It didn't matter if their own fathers were in the state hospital or the federal prison, they hadn't betrayed theirs, and Janice had.\"And there's no real reflection on this. It just happens, and is taken for granted, even by the enlightened Leslie who seems more proud that she gave good advice than horrified by how many parents beat their kids.3. As other reviewers said, this horrible chestnut in so many words:If you cheat on your girl friend by going on a trip to an art museum with your teacher who you had a crush on, she will be dead and cremated when you come back. The whole death plot twist has many odd messages. What is she trying to say? That if you try to escape, it's bad? Jesse uses art to escape his life, and it can't be a coincidence she died during his trip to an art museum. She died on the way to her own source of escape, the quiet place where she could believe all the good things about the rural life, and none of the bad. If she died neutrally, say from a disease, it still would be a tragedy. But the manner of death is too linked to Jesse in a way that blames him for comfort, and that might be part of the trauma many kids feel when they read the book. 4. The death in general.Reading it now, it's odd that for a book that might help kids deal with loss, how little of it actually is designed to do so. She dies when Jesse is away. She is cremated so he can't see the body. There was no service. Jesse has to make his own closure. It's done very briefly too.It's odd. There's also the whole \"punished for escapism,\" \"she died to give him imagination,\" \"too good to live,\" and other subtexts. What was striking about rereading it is how brief the death and aftermath is. It fades right into the \"building a bridge\" chapter, then it ends.It's weird that a book with so many conflicting messages should be winning the most prestigious award in kids lit. I don't think hard themes should be avoided, but the book really doesn't handle them well. Heck, death is a hard subject for adults to deal with, let alone kids. Extra care should be taken, but if anything Bridge feels more like a realistic, literary take aimed as much for parents as kids."}, {"userName": "K.D.

S. Lewis' The Voyage of the Dawn Treader where Lewis has an island called Terebinthia. However she added that Lewis probably based his island's name from Terebinth tree in the Holy Bible so they both pinched from somewhere else, probably unconsciously.Anyways, enough about the name. It's just that I was asked twice already about the meaning of the title of the book that I reviewed so it is becoming part of my psyche to always ask myself the meaning of the title after reading the book especially if the reason is not clear or obvious.The story, set in a small town in the US, is about two lonely 10 year olds, Jesse Aarons and Leslie Burke who find each other's company enjoyable because they are different from the rest of the grade schoolers. Jesse is fond of drawing and he feels unappreciated. Leslie comes from the city, reads a lot of children's fantasy books (her parents are writers) and does not have TV set at home. Before Leslie transfers to Jesse's school, he (Jesse) is the fastest runner. So, their friendship starts with jealousy (because Leslie runs faster than Jesse) and hate but they end up as king and queen of Leslie's make believe world of Terabithia.Sweet story. I am not surprised that even young adults in their teens, 20's and even 30's find this book amazing and rate it with 5 stars. It brings back memories of make-believe worlds when we were young. Especially for those who are in their early 20's and starting their careers, welcome to the real world, dudes!. No more allowances from parents and you have to scrimp yourselves with what you earn. Since you are starting, your salary is ,eager but you are ashamed to ask mom or dad anymore. You want to prove your independence. For those who are starting their families, more budgeting skills are needed. These hardships in real world are sometimes reasons enough for you to think of retreating back to your former secured happy worlds of make-believes. So now, even for few hours, you want to go back there: when you were young and not worrying about money or relationships. Like being in Terabithia and you can do whatever you want because you are the King like Aaron or the Queen like Leslie. Sometimes, you even want to cry oh, I hated the book for making me cry especially when Leslie died because of the pain of realization. You are no longer a child. You are now too old for make-believes. But hey, that's life. You will grow old too. We will all die.Am I not right?"}, {"userName": "Denise", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/665904-denise", "userReview": "Lines I loved:Lark Creek was the backwash of fashion.

Okay, let me get that right. I can be a bubbly energetic or excited individual from time to time. Of course, that isn't what I meant. I'm quite a content, optimistic kind of person so I am emotionally driven - very much so. What I mean to say is that I thrive in my life as a laconic, down to earth kind of person. I'm laid back and when it comes to outward expressions of emotion I tend to internalise. I would still consider myself an extroverted introvert it's just that it is very hard to visibly stun me, shock me or make me cry. I'm not insensitive. I just don't show my reactions most of the time.So, why did I just spend countless sentences on my emotional personality? Mainly to try and convey the fact that this novel right here is one of the few to have rocked me emotionally. It made me raw at the end and it made me tear up. The film has a similar impact. In fact the film is a fairly strong adaptation of this sad, beautiful teardrop of a book.Let me head off on another tangent. I love conclusions. Conclusions are almost my favourite part of any story, save for the fact that it means the book is over and you're left back in reality. However, for this book the conclusion was terrible, shocking, unacceptable. It was too emotionally moving. The happy ending I was expecting wasn't there. And that is why it is a brilliant book: trust me, read it and see if it doesn't touch you in some way. My one warning is that it is a children's novel of course."}, {"userName": "Madeline", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/111921-madeline", "userReview": "When I read this in 5th grade, I really liked it for the first 75% of the story.

And then Katherine Paterson decided to smack me upside the head with the cold, dead fish of Reality.

Also, I often find now that when I read children's books, things seem unrealistically harsh to me -- but they didn't seem that way to me when I was the target age. Apparently I've forgotten a lot about being a kid.One thing I haven't forgotten is how much strategy is required to be a kid, and this book captures that wonderfully. Jess is forever managing people -- to avoid getting beaten up by other kids, to avoid being punished by parents and teachers, to carve out a little time and privacy. My chief problem with this book is that Jess actually is indirectly responsible for Leslie's death, and that's too heavy a responsibility to put on a kid.

Not by employing any manipulative sentimentality, but by being honest. It is a rare thing to be so affected by fictional characters like this. This book saw the birth of a friendship; friendship in truest sense of the word. A perfect example of give and take; a balanced mutuality based on respect. And we almost witnessed the evolution of that friendship into something more potent, profound, altering and everlasting. But just then we helplessly watch the abrupt unfair end of that beautiful blooming, a real nip in the bud (Sorry spoilers!). This book is about those wonderful nascent days of childhood, where everything is impossible and beautiful. It\u2019s about two young children who didn\u2019t fit in their respective worlds. They stowed away to build a bridge to their own private land, where they reigned as king and queen; it was a just kingdom where simply put, negativity wasn\u2019t allowed. When we had first met Jesse, he was an awkward boy unsure of himself, a budding artist, but he rather felt embarrassed about his art. He was at odds with his almost all female family, hungry for his father\u2019s waning attention, acceptance, and approval. Leslie changed him. She helped him grow, not only as an artist, but also as a person. Ultimately, she'd help him deal with his loss, almost unendurable pain, she'd help him heal and recover from it, to be a better more mature and generous person. That he managed to pass on what he learned was his victory. Not for a second will this book would feel like it\u2019s geared toward children. In fact, this should be essential reading for adults. It makes you question certain things. Maybe we\u2019d understand something in the process. It\u2019s obligatory visual cousin is different, but equally good albeit a little more detailed . One of those occurrences where both mediums are equally rich and enriching. The book\u2019s counterpart is just a visceral display of the same beautiful emotional bond. This book will make you cry, end of. Not at the inevitable loss, but at what could have been.Additional; some books are pure magic where every word is made up of joy, and this is one of them. Even better on rereads. What a surfeit of imaginations, the display of childhood and power of friendship. Watch these kids forge a kinship. Leslie brimming with intelligence. When Jess was thinking how he could draw a whale, you could see the vibrancy of colors in his mind. Pure magic this book is. I cannot love this book enough. I cannot reread it enough.

There are a few mild swear words in the book, and they are merely used for emphasis. If having a crush on a girl means the book contains sexual content, and if creating a magic kingdom (Terabithia) in which to play at being king and queen means dabbling in the occult or Satanism, well\u2026 need I say more?Death and what happens to a person after dying are also discussed in the book. Perhaps some adults think children shouldn\u2019t read about death. Personally, I commend Patterson for writing a moving story for children that addresses adult themes, and yet is never condescending.

Having first read the book at age 10, I didn't pay much attention to the dedication page. Apparently, though, Katherine Paterson wrote this book based upon the experiences of her own son, who at 8 years old, lost his childhood best friend to a tragic accident (she was struck by lightning -- how awful). Learning that Paterson wrote this story in part to help her son grieve and make sense of such a painful loss made the story all the more touching to me somehow.

Their lives seem rather sad and mundane, except for the few instances where they actually get to escape to their secret hideaway, Terabithia.

Sin embargo, en la novela, Terabithia me ha dado lo impresi\u00f3n de ser algo m\u00e1s conceptual y filos\u00f3fico, es el nombre que ellos le dan al \u00fanico lugar en el mundo donde pueden sentirse libres y jugar a su aire, y dejar volar su imaginaci\u00f3n, pero en ning\u00fan momento he sentido nada parecido al objetivo que tiene la adaptaci\u00f3n, no s\u00e9 si se me entiende. No digo que la pel\u00edcula no me gustara, pero en este sentido el libro es mucho m\u00e1s bonito y realista.Ahora voy a entrar a valorar los aspectos de la novela, voy a empezar con el estilo de Katherine Paterson, la verdad es que es muy bonito, es una prosa muy \u00e1gil y ligera, sin pr\u00e1cticamente descripciones y sin figuras ret\u00f3ricas, este es el aspecto en el que m\u00e1s se nota que es un libro infantil, pero nos demuestra que nada de esto es necesario para engancharte a su narrativa y que no quieras parar de leer, esta mujer nos deja frases preciosas. Ojal\u00e1 y hubiese le\u00eddo este libro en mi infancia o adolescencia, creo que en esos momentos necesitaba algo as\u00ed.Respecto a los personajes, me han encantado todos, pero sobre todo Jess, el protagonista, la creaci\u00f3n de este personaje me ha parecido enormemente realista, todos sus miedos, inseguridades, su manera de actuar y evolucionar a lo largo de toda la novela, creo que es muy propia de un ni\u00f1o de 10 a\u00f1os, no hay nada que no cuadre en ning\u00fan momento. Leslie tambi\u00e9n me ha gustado mucho, es una ni\u00f1a muy fuerte y valiente, que posee un gran poder imaginativo, la relaci\u00f3n de amistad entre estos dos personajes es bell\u00edsima, lo mejor es que vamos viendo c\u00f3mo se construye poco a poco a lo largo de toda la historia hasta que se convierten en dos almas inseparables. Es un libro corto y est\u00e1 claro que los secundario no son tan profundos, pero para nada se notan de relleno o que no intervengan en la historia, al contrario, cada personaje es estrictamente necesario, menci\u00f3n especial a la profesora de m\u00fasica del colegio, la relaci\u00f3n que Jess tiene con este personaje tambi\u00e9n es maravillosa.En cuanto al desarrollo de la trama, no tiene grandes giros, excepto al final, claro est\u00e1, pero esto se suple con lo realmente bonitas y elegantes que son todas y cada una de las escenas de este libro, que hablan de la infancia, de la inocencia, de la amistad, cumplir tus sue\u00f1os sin importar lo que piensen los dem\u00e1s, y si lees un poco m\u00e1s entre l\u00edneas, tambi\u00e9n de la hipocres\u00eda social, de la falta de sensibilidad que tiene la mayor\u00eda de las personas para ciertos temas como el bullying, o el maltrato infantil. Incluso del significado de la religi\u00f3n en nuestras vidas. Tambi\u00e9n me encantan todas lar referencias que se hacen a otras obras literarias y que se de a entender lo importante que puede ser el arte en nuestras vidas.Vamos que para m\u00ed, toda una obra maestra, est\u00e1 a la altura del arte, y que el final me ha hecho llorar mucho, a pesar de que ya hab\u00eda visto la pel\u00edcula y ya sab\u00eda c\u00f3mo iba a terminar todo, pero a\u00fan as\u00ed no he podido evitarlo, es que la novela te da una perspectiva de la historia diferente."}], "description": "A secret world of their own.
