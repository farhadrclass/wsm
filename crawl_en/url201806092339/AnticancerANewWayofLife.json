It's a shame because the book's recommendations for lifestyle changes apply to everyone, whether you're battling cancer or not. Besides, everyone has cancer cells and everyone is bombarded with carcinogenes, so it behooves us to do all we can to protect our health in the face of these internal and external threats. Servan-Schreiber covers an enormous amount of ground in 220 pages, dispensing advice in the areas of diet, meditation, spirituality, exercise, and even cell phone use (thank you, Devra Davis). But only on the topic of diet and nutrition does he really go into depth, and here even people well-read on the topic might learn a thing or two. For instance, did you know that cooked tomatoes offer more lycopene, especially when they're cooked in olive oil? \"Anticancer,\" though, is mainly a repackaging and compiling of some of the most common-sense ideas out there. Unfortunately, most people never stop to consider these ideas, which explains why we have epidemics of cancer, diabetes and obesity in our country, not to mention of personal and family dysfunction."}, {"userName": "John Harris", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17273047-john-harris", "userReview": "I can't begin to tell all that this book meant to me during my cancer fight. I stumbled across it a few days after my diagnosis. I wasn't looking for a cancer book. Yet, it changed my life.This book showed me that I can do things to stay healthy, despite doctors saying there's nothing I could do. I still had to do six rounds of chemotherapy and surgery but this book still gave me valuable information and I think helped me stay alive.The book follows Dr. Servan-Schreiber's story of his own \"accidental\" discovery of cancer and going in then out of remission. With that said, he backs up all his points with research. What are his major points?That we create/nurture the \"terrain\" of our bodies or immune systems by what we eat, how much we exercise and how we manage stress. I am over-simplifying but you'll have to read the book to get the details.It's been three years since my stage 4 diagnosis and I still follow everything that's in this book. One part that I think is weak: Dr. Servan-Schreiber was not a religious person so his focus on the spiritual aspect is really centered on yoga and more of a new age philosophy. As a Christian, I believe Christianity has a whole lot more to give.Don't think you have to be a cancer patient to buy this. If you want to live healthy and keep disease away, buy this book. I am pretty much a skeptic when it comes to self-help, cure-all philosophies but this is not one of those. Just buy the book."}, {"userName": "Lisa (Harmonybites)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2596042-lisa-harmonybites", "userReview": "Color me dubious. The further I read into this book, the more skeptical I became--which is a shame, because Dr Servan-Schreiber with his unique perch as physician, research scientist and cancer patient would, I thought, be the perfect person to sift the solid science from wishful thinking and outright quackery but...This book is rated as high as it is because nothing in his proposed program could do harm (the mindset being a different story) and I couldn't help being fascinated by parts and moved by others. Servan-Schreiber with his background as a research scientist was lucid and engaging in describing cancer's mechanisms and cancer research. I loved reading about \"mighty mouse\"--the mouse seemingly immune to cancer. I had to agree after reading those early chapters that \"cancer is a fascinating and perverse phenomenon.\" And I couldn't help but be moved and inspired by many of the stories--not just his own but that of naturalist Stephen Jay Gould who against the odds beat his own cancer, and Jacqueline, a cancer patient who found reserves of strength in practicing karate with fellow cancer patients.How could I not be moved? I was diagnosed with Stage Three Breast cancer in September of last year. In the preceding months I've undergone months of chemotherapy, a mastectomy, radiation treatments and will continue getting infusions of Herceptin until this October. And I've met far too many cancer patients who are on their second or third round with cancer. I don't want to go through all this again--thus the appeal of the promise of the title. I could certainly identify with and understand so much the people in these pages went through--and I get the fierce hope that you could take your destiny in your own hands--that you can beat back your body's betrayal. Feeling in control is so very important to you. I get that.But there's a flip side to that which isn't so positive. I've encountered people certainly who believe the patient should be blamed for their cancer. In a review of mine critical of one health guru I was told straight out that I should listen to this author--that it was my lifestyle that had made me sick. I believe Servan-Schreiber plays into this with his insistence on the \"mind/body connection\"--this idea, or at least implication--that if you succumb you had not just the wrong lifestyle but the wrong attitude. Ironically Servan-Schreiber's own careful tending of his \"terrain\" did not stop him from dying of cancer some years ago. Humans are mortal--that's not under our control and sometimes when it comes to cancer we lose--and it's not our fault.And there's another problem with this kind of view--that cancer is under our control and would be prevented if only the medical and pharmaceutical establishment would acknowledge the truth. To Servan-Schreiber's credit he emphasizes the importance of conventional therapy, and emphasizes his prescriptions are meant to be complimentary, not alternatives. In the book Herceptin, one of the drugs I'm taking, is described as \"a revolutionary drug qualified in 2005 as a 'major turning point in the eradication of suffering and death from cancer.'\" I'm expected to survive this--and for that I credit the achievements of those lambasted pillars of the medical and pharmaceutical establishment. But in these past months I've met more than one cancer patient who have refused not just (admittedly scary and debilitating) chemotherapy but the relatively low-risk/high benefit radiation and hormone treatments. Who have told me that people like my oncologist are shills for the pharmaceutical companies and \"don't you know what they give you in chemo is poison?\" I do know--that's the point--it poisons the cancer. Yes, it poisons the patient as well--but we have the better chance of bouncing back.So I worry books like these contribute to the paranoia, the distrust of life-saving medicines. All the more because in the end Servan-Schreiber struck me as ultimately far too credulous--there seemed to be no cause of cancer ever put out there from cell phones to deodorants to Teflon pans he wouldn't credit--ditto any purported alternate therapies down to that of shamans and Tibetan monks. Servan-Schreiber takes seriously T. Colin Campbell, a doctrinaire vegetarian and author of The China Study--a controversial figure but Servan-Schrieber skips the controversy. I just never got the sense in this book that evidence on the other side was considered beyond the quick dismissing of straw men. Some of what he cautions against might cause cancer, some of what he advises might be protective--my point is in the end I felt no confidence he could help me sort out which.However, as I wrote above, at least the prescriptions themselves would do little harm--except maybe to your wallet--organic food and cosmetics, water filters... Much of the advice is what any doctor would tell you--avoid processed foods, consume plenty of veggies, fruit, tea, fish rich in Omega-3, get plenty of sunshine and exercise. No, the seductive dangers of the book are more subtle than that."}, {"userName": "Kelsey", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68736-kelsey", "userReview": "READ THIS BOOK EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE CANCER!

Four years is approximately the amount of time it took for me to find about half of the scientific literature in this book. Later, if anyone says \"But there's no scientific evidence that you can fight cancer naturally!\" you'll be armed with a tome of evidence to the contrary.The author is a straddler, and I admit I'm partial to straddlers. His expertise and experience have made him someone who comfortably straddles the worlds of academic research, the medical community, pharmacological research, and natural agents that fight disease. He knows enough about each culture to tell readers why there are certain gaps in the knowledge of each.Anti Cancer is all around excellent scientific writing, some of the best I've read this year. The author has a tremendous talent for distilling complex ideas into clear, concise sentences and reinforcing them with diagrams and images that make scientific points clear to people with no prior information on how cells work, for example, or how our immune systems work. The author would be a great teacher (if he's not already).Most importantly (to me), Anti Cancer is not chock full of pat statements akin to \"This natural thing works. Really!\" Wholly unsubstantiated claims from naturopaths disappoint me no less than deceptive statements from big pharma. I need the why and the how of something in order to believe in it, and this book is full of why and how. In Anti Cancer, there is never a claim that something works without an immediately ensuing explanation of why and how it works: One of many excellent examples is \"How green tea, and specific kinds of green tea in particular, stop angiogenesis in tumors and the conditions under which it works best.\" In addition, I am pleased with the author's comfort with gray areas, which is what most of life's more complicated aspects have. Our culture (and U.S. culture is the only one I can speak to) seems uncomfortable with these, and whole segments of the populace seem to want the comfort of \"In all cases, THIS is the right thing to do.\" Instead of reinforcing this, the author explains that he has experienced and still advocates traditional cancer treatments, and he is also comfortable with stating the benefits of natural treatments of cancer without claiming that they can cure cancer completely. The author is comfortable stating the problems with processed food and meat while also acknowledging studies that show that the type of meat (grass fed vs. not, for instance) makes a difference. Claims like this may disappoint more hardcore vegan readers.Which brings me to my last accolade: The author is comfortable and honest about the limitations of knowledge, while also stating what is known and not shying away from that gap. He does not tend toward extremism or what I'm starting to call the militant religiosity of certain beliefs, which we see in regard to organic vs. GMO food; natural childbirth vs. hospital birth; immunization benefits vs. drawbacks; and all sorts of other aspects of daily life. This is a welcome relief from the usual level of discourse that posits things in either-or relationships vs. \"both\" and \"maybe\" and \"sometimes.\"Everyone can benefit from reading this book.

This book is so well written, and it has a great amount of research data included in an easy to read narrative style. I applaud Dr Servan for this very helpful book contribution in understanding the immune system and how it effects our health and well-being. I was particularly interested in his conclusion from medical studies that the ability to keep one's emotional state in balance and stress-free is also important to aid the immune system to fight off alien cancer cells and tumors. I felt his book so important that I cited it in my own book and discussion on using somatic practices on gut feelings to strengthen the immune system and combat dis-ease.

I can't recommend it as a good reading experience. So here's a summary tailored for people interested in breast cancer.The main message is that cancer is a chronic disease influenced heavily by the environment and lifestyle. Although mainstream western medicine is excellent at treating acute problems, it terrible at preventing and treating chronic problems. Dr. S-S thinks that nutrition, exercise, and \"peace of mind\" are also needed to treat (and prevent) cancer and goes over the limited research, and a gazillion anecdotes, showing how these things may influence cancer. He quotes a World Health Organization report that up to \"80% of cancers may be influenced by lifestyle and the environment.\" The most convincing research to support that was a study that showed Chinese women who moved to San Francisco had 3-5 times the rate of breast cancer than women in the same age groups who stayed in China.Dr. S-S believes that nutrition, exercise, and whatever (woo-woo, religious, or other) ways we can stay calm influence immune system function. We all have \"microtumors\" which could turn into cancer. These can be kept in check by the immune system but tumors that successfully take hold actually hijack the immune system in order to grow. The nutrition information is extensive. There are lists of vegetables that inhibit the growth of specific types of cancer, according to the one doctor in Montreal who decided to research this despite the fact that nobody can patent food as a treatment and make millions like pharmaceutical companies do. (Taxol was one profitable example which took something like 500 million dollars for the research to validate it as effective.) Garlic, leeks, scallions, are at the top of the list for all types of cancer and brussel sprouts, cauliflower, cabbage, kale, broccoli, radishes, and onions round out the top of the list for breast cancer. One section recommends against eating sugar or anything with a high glycemic index. Also, this book finally cleared up the mystery for me about whether eating meat is healthy or not. We get much better nutrition from the meat and eggs of animals that have eaten good diets themselves. If you feed animals nothing but cheap processed corn products, then their meat isn't good for us. There's some pro-Omega-3 info (vs. Omega-6) discussion which points to the benefits of eating fish and taking fish oil supplements. Green tea obstructs cancer formation and growth in 3 different ways and just 2 cups a day provides those benefits.There was a more about the benefits of support groups, exercise, and finding peace of mind. One interesting thing is that it doesn't take much exercise to provide a protective effect for breast cancer. \"Walking 2-5 hours per week at a normal speed has a powerful effect on preventing relapse.\"The book covers the important point that none of this means that anyone is responsible for having cancer. The environment/lifestyle issues are cultural and a lot of our food is produced in unhealthy ways.

(connected to a.) he seems to have missed pretty much all research into plant-based (vegan) diets that is already out there. I find the last point particularly puzzling, because even though S-S arrives at the conclusion that only plant-based nutrition helps in the fight against cancer, and even though he writes (end of ch. 8) that 'In its \u201cDietary Goals for the United States,\u201d [the McGovern committee] naively recommended \u201clowering the consumption of meat and dairy products\u201d [because of its role in causing heart disease/stroke]', he never states (dares to state?) the conclusion that seems to logically follow, namely that a fully plant-based diet is the only way to go. And if we look at his dietary recommendations, we see that while he emphasizes eating legumes/fruits/vegs, he writes to discourage animal product consumption than that \"Meat and eggs are optional. They don\u2019t represent the main ingredient of the plate. They are there primarily for added taste\", without emphasizing that these foods are specifically unhealthy. This even though it should have been clear even based on his own research that precisely such strategic vacillation has led to millions of unnecessary cancer, diabetes and heart disease deaths.Now, to provide interested readers with a few links, I would point out that since the book was released in 2009, a lot of additional evidence has been found that meat, dairy and egg consumption are strong or even primary contributors to 13 out of the 16 causes of death. For instance, it was recently discovered that cholesterol serves as food for tumors (leading to the lowered LDL values that were earlier seen as 'proof' that blood cholesterol does not contribute to cancer risk); further evidence was found that IGF1 (a growth hormone found in all dairy products, which is produced by cows to help their calves grow) promotes cancer growth, so that any dietary intake is undesirable; and that the eating of meat leads to a low-level inflammatory response associated with, among other things, diabetes and atherosclerosis, because the meat contains bacterial toxins that enter the meat-eater's bloodstream. In sum, especially for cancer patients, but really for people generally, the eating of animal products should be avoided across the board."}, {"userName": "Isaure", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49446688-isaure", "userReview": "Pour l'instant ce livre me laisse \u00e9bahie et je me demande comment j'ai pu passer \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 pendant tant d'ann\u00e9es...

He became a doctor and scientist at the University of Pittsburgh. One day, his research subject failed to show up, so he volunteered to have a brain scan as part of the research study he was conducting with his colleagues. To his surprise,he himself, discovered that he had brain cancer. And so begins a unique story - Schreiber's own journey through cancer as a young, budding doctor and researcher who discovers that doctors don't have all the answers. I loved this book!Servan-Schreiber is a rare specimen indeed!His views on complimentary therapies to chemo and radiation are not what I would expect from most MDs. He recommends therapies that probably EVERY cancer patient has tried, but would never dara speak to their oncologist about. BUT that's not all.He provides ample research, data and case studies to back up his arguments!NOW that's beautiful!Facing a near-terminal diagnosis, he had no choice but to refuse to believe that there were no other options than chemo and radiation. He refuses to believe that the patient can do nothing and doctors can do it all.He takes on some big topics: * what foods can enhance chemotherapy * why proper nutrition is paramount but overlooked by oncologists * why sugar is cancer's best friend * toxic environments we frequent everyday * invoking deep healing with meditation * the anti-cancer mind * finding beauty in deathAnti-Cancer is a *must-read* for anyone who is going through cancer right now. But it's also a *must-read* for those of us who are survivors.

If nothing else, you\u2019ll end up drinking more green tea. Better yet, you\u2019ll also focus on relieving stress, exercising more, reducing environmental pollutants, reducing body fat, and eating more cruciferous veggies, mushrooms, garlic, whole plant foods, and omega 3s and less sugar, refined carbs, pesticides, and animal fats. While that sounds really dry and not so motivational, this book is incredibly moving. It\u2019s vastly compassionate towards the physical, emotional, and spiritual pain suffered by cancer patients and those close to them. Yet I hope that you read this book before cancer ever strikes. Obviously, perfect health is guaranteed to no one; nevertheless, the practices and habits recommended by the author, who lived for almost 20 years past his initial brain cancer diagnosis, are beneficial on so many levels without harmful side effects. Kind of limiting that the book is called Anti-Cancer when it\u2019s also Pro-Health and Healing. So lovely that the author was able to transform his personal experiences and research of cancer therapy into such a poignant, beneficial, and practical book."}, {"userName": "Edie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/934380-edie", "userReview": "Another cancer book that I would recommend to anyone who wants to live a healthier lifestyle. The author is a physician who found out he himself had brain cancer by accident while working on clinical trials. This chronicles his journey and how his own diagnosis changed the way he conducted his research, and eventually his life. It advocates a holistic approach but the nutrition stuff is actually backed up by hard science. It's not a self-help book, but he does touch on the subject of how such a diagnosis can affect personal relationships and self worth. My favorite part is near the end when he discusses how he cames to terms with his own mortality. I have changed my diet as a result of reading this; he uses a scientific appproach but does so in layman's terms and I understood a lot of stuff after reading it that I had heard about before but didn't quite \"get,\" like the relationship between the glycemic load of a food and subsequent spike in insulin is related to cancer-cell growth."}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/922106-christine", "userReview": "This is a great book. The cover says all of us have cancer cells in our bodies (something my husband who does genetic sequencing informatics had also told me), but not all of us will develop cancer. The Action Pages near the end of the book offer concrete, practical advice for the lifestyle that can prevent 60% of cancers. Yes, eat more fruits and vegetables, but no they don't all have to be raw to keep their inflammation-fighting, immunity-boosting properties (eating foods raw preserves enzymes which may have other benefits not discussed here). Other parts of the book are very moving like stories of people who beat cancer, or even if dying from cancer felt that Dr. Servan-Schreiber had saved his life because of encouraging him to do something meaningful for others before he died, etc. A chapter on how to talk with people who may not recover is also included. He is a psychiatrist, too, after all, not just a neurological researcher who survived two brain tumors.

My mother had passed away from pancreatic cancer the previous month and I didn't even want to think about cancer, much less read about what she might have done to prevent it or lengthened her life. But I eventually began reading it and was inspired by it to make some changes in our lifestyle. This is not the first book I have read on this topic of changing diet, exercise and the existence of a mind-body connection but it may have been what I did need to read right now. My husband and I started changing the way we have been eating because of stress. For the first time in my life, I began to drink green tea 3 times a day. We had already started walking often and I resumed yoga. This does give a person hope that there is something active we can do to help our bodies avoid cancer or heal themselves and I am grateful for that.
