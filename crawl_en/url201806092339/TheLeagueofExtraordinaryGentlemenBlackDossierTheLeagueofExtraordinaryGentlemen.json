That's okay, I suspect that it's true. I adored the first two volumes of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. They were my first introduction to Alan Moore during the very early days of my comic fandom, and I was delighted with how they were darkly funny and smart and full of literary references.The Black Dossier, however, tries too hard too be all of those things and while I often don't agree when people accuse someone of being \"self-indulgent,\" I think it applies here. The barest, barest bones of a story exist in order to display every literary reference Moore can throw at it, and there were dense pages of prose (the Black Dossier of the title) that seemed like a wasted telling-instead-of-showing overview of the League's history. The final portion of the book was what pushed me from 3 stars to 2, when I was distracted by the 3D gimmick and the bizarrely racist character and the near-manic sing-songy conversation about the Blazing World in which they found themselves. It felt like one of those old Looney Tunes cartoons where everyone is screaming and flying around.After turning the final page, all I could wonder was, \"Just what the hell was the point of all that?\""}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/640667-sarah", "userReview": "There's two major strikes against The Black Dossier, and neither of them has anything to do with the contents of the book. The first, of course, is that we've been waiting years for this - five years, for many, just to see any new LoEG work; two years since the Dossier itself was announced. Expectations therefore peaked at a high, and that never bodes well for something as unusual and experimental as this.The second is that this really should have been the final volume of LoEG. But more on that in a minute.Basically, the book has a very thin plot, something any decent reader will notice after just a cursory flip through the pages. It's the almanac section from Volume II writ large - documents, postcards, letters, \"extracts\" and other errata chronicling the centuries-spanning LoEG's history, built to engage you more as a puzzle than a narrative, with the occasional bone thrown out in the comics framing story. Fortunately, the Almanac was probably my favorite part of Volume II, so I enjoyed the game - although I was aware that, in simply telling us so much about his creation, Moore is basically robbing us of the potential for those stories in the future. We will never see the battle of Mina Murray's League against their French counterparts, nor the failed replacement League of the post-WWII years, nor the formation of Prospero's Men. It's all here - in prose form. Moore is both flexing the comics medium to its full potential and withholding its more traditional use. Fascinating, but ever so slightly disappointing.That's why this really should have been the last story of the LoEG to be published (as I expect it still will be, 'chronologically'). With the foreknowledge that Volume III arrives from Top Shelf in a year, this is less a goodbye to the League and more just a goodbye to the League...at DC Comics. Fair enough, but there are some real meditations here on the changing nature of literary heroes - and, later, on fiction itself - which are going to be completely overlooked because a lot of readers, having been surprised and intimidated by the Black Dossier, will simply put it aside and wait for Volume III without ever giving it a second glance.I definitely enjoyed The Black Dossier. It wasn't quite what I expected when it was first announced two years ago, but by the time descriptions started to leak online, I suspected something less about one narrative story and more about the act of storytelling. That's pretty much what I got. It's not a total home run - I'll have trouble recommending it to friends, and Moore's casual sexualizing of characters still (and always has) makes me vaguely uncomfortable - but it's overall good stuff, and I'll be holding on to my copy for sure."}, {"userName": "Darren", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/823062-darren", "userReview": "\"The Black Dossier\" is not nearly as fun as the earlier editions of \"The League.\" As it begins to dawn on you that a considerable stretch of the book is dominated by text-only pages, you may begin to worry that Moore has become yet another Dave Sim - who, as the years passed on his 6000 page \"Cerebus\" saga, began to sprinkle in ever-more turgid parodies of great authors, longwinded self-serving rants against feminism and Marxism, and over a hundred pages of theory on the Torah, written in small type, in the voice of a stammering drunken Aardvark, narrated to a fictionalized Woody Allen. With the exception of a beautiful homage to Oscar Wilde, Sim's prose is as uniformly awful as his graphic storytelling is transcendent.But Moore's \"Black Dossier\" has several things going for it that Sim didn't. Moore is not a paranoid ideologue who believes women's existence contributes to a breakdown of humanity on every social, political, economic, and cultural level. Moore is less interested in religion than in fiction. Moore has a profound sense of humor.Although there is a plot to \"The Black Dossier,\" the better part of the book is essentially an appendix to the first two volumes, exploring the world which used to appear steampunk and now stands revealed as the predominant work of metafiction of the early 21st century. How much you enjoy \"Black Dossier\" may depend on which you liked more - \"The Lord of the Rings\" or \"The Silmarillion.\" A chapter imitates the style of PG Wodehouse's \"Jeeves and Wooster\" stories with the substance of HP Lovecraft - importantly, the chapter is funny even if you have no idea who either of those men are. The same holds true for the imitation of primitive erotica, in which sex goddess Fanny Hill fuckscrews her way through several fantasy worlds, and \"Faerie's Fortune Founded,\" a lost fragment of a fictional Shakespeare play, which is as readable as any of Shakespeare's plays - that is, for some people it will be amazing, and for some people it will be unreadable. (The same may be true for \"The Crazy Wide Forever\" by Sal Paradyse, imitation-Kerouac with no punctuation and random strings of words. It is possible that, if you like Kerouac, you will like this - to me, it is Moore's one real failure in the book, a waxwork homage that sacrifices entertainment for verisimilitude, like Gus Van Sant's \"Psycho.\")I don't quite think \"Black Dossier\" is as complete a work as \"Watchmen\" or \"From Hell\" - both of those series took elaborate flights of fancy and tangent, but both also never lost track of the say-it-again-STORY. The narrative in \"Black Dossier\" is a chase with the bare minimum of tension, with plenty of time for sightseeing along the way (it is telling that the people who are being chased have plenty of time to read the titular Dossier, taking time out from their own book to read another one). It ends with an elaborate scene set in the Blazing World - one of the first imaginary worlds created for literature, making it Moore's alpha and omega, a paradise for fictional creations of all sorts (in the background, you will see copyright-baiting variations on Charlie Brown and Captain Marvel, and you will also see fairies fucking in midair). This scene is essentially an elaborate party to rival Trimalchio; it requires 3-D glasses; it lacks any real sense of climax. Prospero, from Shakespeare's \"The Tempest,\" leads us away with a soliloquy about nothing less than the existence of fiction. Just as Raging Bull ends with de Niro doing la Motta doing Brando doing Terry Malloy, so \"Black Dossier\" ends with Moore doing Prospero doing Shakespeare doing Prospero. Round and round.The speech reads like a conclusion - to the series, to Moore's career, to the comic book medium, to human imagination. Intriguingly, this is not the end of the series - Moore has promised a genuine third volume next year, so expect it for Christmas 2012. Still, this is certainly the end of Moore's thesis for the \"League\" project. What started out as a funny riff on the team comic book has become the ur-story of all fiction. In this, Moore's book stands next to Don Rosa's \"The life and Times of Scrooge McDuck,\" which absorbed hundreds of stories written by Carl Barks about Scrooge McDuck and linked them into a common history, resulting in a work that was both grander (in sweep) and more detailed (in artistic style and comic substance) than Barks was ever allowed. Oddly, this is not the first time a comic book creator has used Prospero as a metaphorical stand-in for all fictional creations - Neil Gaiman's \"The Sandman\" ended with an issue devoted to Shakespeare's \"The Tempest.\""}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/587247-matt", "userReview": "Way too dense for a \"fun\" read but still great.

Alan Moore's a very clever fellow, you certainly can't deny that. Not that this book will let you. Virtually every page can be pored over for references to some literary or pseudo-literary or pulp work: newspaper headlines, street names, background details, nameless characters--they all (presumably, since I can't figure out all of them) reference or come from somewhere. It is of course a massive and complex task to weave every fiction and fictional world you can think of into a single narrative, and Moore does manage generally to paper over the obvious gaps and inconsistencies and problems with doing so, making it all feel more or less coherent. However, maybe this is just me, but I find myself engaged more with figuring out all the references than with the story, which is basically a simple chase tale, as Mina and Quatermain acquire the eponymous Black Dossier and then get chased by James Bond (who tries to rape Mina and is presented as a sociopath, Moore's propensity for the desecration of previous literary models continuing unabated here, with generally unappealing results), Emma Peel, and Bulldog Drummond to get it back, meeting every other late nineteenth through mid twentieth century literary figure Moore can jam in along the way. So, as a story, not that engaging. Furthermore, in addition to being a clever metatext weaving in all kind sof literary references, this book also wants to present itself as being a dossier consisting of an array of different kinds of documents: official reports, Tijuana Bible, pulp novel, lost Shakespearean folio, postcards, etc.--so you get to be impressed by another level of cleverness. The dossier contents offer a multitude of sources that relate the origin not only of the League but also of all spectacular and unusually-powered folk in human history, in a kind of League-universe cosmology and theogeny. This idea's interesting enough in its own way, but it doesn't work well because of Moore's insistence on doing it all via parody and pastiche. Moore does a pretty good Shakespeare, a passable John Cleland, an okay P. G., Woodhouse, but a weak Orwell and an unreadable Kerouac. Even when the pastiches/parodies are solid, though, they simply bog down the book; Moore lacks the genius for gelling prose and comics Dave Sim displayed at his best. I mean, I give him points for ambition, and for nerve (trying to reclaim the gollywog from the Noddy books is almost as risky as the pornographic treatment he gave Alice and company in Lost Girls), but ultimately the result falls flat and sterile. It comes across as an exercise in cleverness and show-off pyrotechnics, rather than as an actual story. And this is a pity, as Moore can tell a hell of a story when he decides to do so, rather than going on (and on) yet again about the importance of story in a metafictional jigsaw puzzle."}, {"userName": "David Schaafsma", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/269235-david-schaafsma", "userReview": "I'd read this before, and now have read it again, and liked it better. Someone said the League series is like a superheroes tale for English majors ( or fantastical tale or comics/myth Super Group yarn), and that seems right, it's all inter-textual and in order to fully appreciate it, you have to have read quite a bit, of both comics and thrillers and mysteries and Shakespeare and this is especially true for The Black Dossier, which brings Mina and Alan Quartermain up to the eighties and Thatcher's England. It's thin on plot but I don't mind that, I like the story a lot, and then it has all these fun and complicating experimental elements. The 3 D story is beautifully done by Kevin O'Neill (and the team), there's a two page pic of the League ship, there's a Tijuana Bible insert, and ads, and lots of stuff they just whip up for kicks, and to reclaim in some sense the fun of comics with all those ads and fun stuff throughout to break things up, texture the telling, it's all part of the experience. There's some erotica (update Fanny Hill from the 19th century) for the repressive anti-porn eighties, a new prologue to a play by Shakespeare\u2026. it all adds up to an endorsement of the imagination that crosses the line politically and aesthetically and morally (re: sex, maybe especially, but sex and fantasy are always enjoyably entertained in Moore). I can see why lots of people found it confounding or pretentious or just too complicated, but I think the creators were just mainly trying to have fun in multiple forms and genres, and it is successful in that respect. It's hard to read in places, too, small print, some long prose passages where Moore (as happens for him from time to time) cannot be limited to comics, there's longish parodies, sometimes amazing and sometimes uneven\u2026 a kind of pastiche of storytelling techniques and forms and styles\u2026 mainly Moore showing you what's out there, what's possible at that time\u2026 Maybe it stretches the League story beyond its original intentions, beyond just the fun storytelling, the deft and clever reference here and there, it amps up that referencing, but I think that intertextuality is part of the original intent of the series, a mishmash of characters and styles and periods, so this makes sense to me even if it is a tad difficult at times to take in..."}, {"userName": "Corey", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/628587-corey", "userReview": "I have never been made to feel stupid by a book, except maybe a few math textbooks, but this book came very, very close. I got the very real impression that I should read it again in a few years when I've accrued more knowledge and experience, and maybe even read more books. It's still a spectacular book, but it can get a little self-indulgent at times (you can tell Moore wasn't writing this for anyone but himself) but it almost always errs on the side of entertainment. From a \"lost\" Shakespeare manuscript for a prequel to The Tempest, to a fully 3D section, complete with glasses that will leave you looking incredibly foolish reading the last 10 minutes of the book if you do so in public as you'll also be winking to get the full effect of certain images.Overall the book has many more hits than misses, but there are a couple of points that I had to skim over, in particular a part that is pure babble for several pages, and it truly is a \"graphic novel\" as half of it is prose, which works just fine for me. The amount you'll enjoy this will be directly proportionate to how much you've enjoyed some of Alan Moore's more obscure work. This is more Courtyard than Watchmen, more From Hell than V for Vendetta, but if you like your comic books with a healthy chunk of prose, and with a healthier chunk of classical literary references (many of which went right over my head), this book will not disappoint on any level."}, {"userName": "Martin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6364929-martin", "userReview": "See Brooke's review, which pretty much says what I have to say about this book.I thought that integrating all these disparate threads of English fiction was a good - if overly ambitious - idea, but leave it to Alan Moore to attempt just that. Some of it works. The prose sections were tedious and self-indulgent, and they totally killed any momentum the book was trying to build up to that point. I eventually skipped those; I feared that I wouldn't be able to finish the book otherwise! The last 17 pages are in 3D, to be read with the 3D glasses that come with the book. This whole gimmick was unnecessary, and the pages themselves were a bit of a mess and full of exposition, sort of trying to explain the whole book's purpose to any readers who had not - by that point - realised 'what it was all about'.For all the creativity put into this book (and it is positively bursting with it), there was just as much indulgence on the writer's part, and that's what ultimately hurt the book, in my opinion.Also: The part about The Crazy Wide Forever was gobbledegook.

The book is a strange mix of comic strips, short stories and in a few cases even novelty postcards and advertisements. I am sure I have miss a lot of what is going on and will no doubt need to read this several times over to truly discover all the messages, jokes and hints hidden within the pages. It is very difficult to talk about the book without giving things away about the storyline - not because its too easy but more because the storyline is so involved that to mention any part of it would no doubt give too much away, for example (no dont worry) - the Black Dossier at points event makes reference to Mina and her League and not only does it reference to artwork but even appears to match what I was reading in my hands. I was almost looking at the same dossier they were.I will admit that the change in story and presentation can see a little distracting and confusing but the various parts are a perfect balance and how they are linked together is pure genius.

He somehow manages to make me simultaneously feel smart for all of the references I catch and stupid for all the ones I know I've missed. This mad notion of knitting together all of the fabled literary worlds and characters into one (mostly) coherent history shouldn't work, but it does. This newest bit of League history has a whisper-thin plot, but that's really just an excuse to further flesh out this amazing world and to have terrific fun experimenting with different forms and styles. Some of these experiments work better than others: I find both the Beat novels and Lovecraft's work almost unreadable; combining the two (however cleverly) didn't help; on the other hand, if Jeeves and Bertie appeared in all of Lovecraft's stories, I'd read them a lot more frequently.The package itself is amazing. Different art styles, different paper textures, a Tijuana Bible, an unbelievably gorgeous 3-D section (glasses are included); as an art object, it's beautiful. The fact that there actually is a story to hang it all on, however thin, is really just the icing on the cake.NOTE: Those of you familiar with the previous volumes are no doubt also familiar with the redoutable Jess Nevins and his panel-by-panel annotations of those works.

A friend of mine, a very talented painter, graphic designer and a fan of graphic novels, told me that this book is also a compendium of all the techniques used comic books today. And I would dare say that it possibly adds some tricks of its own and a wink to past techniques. Kevin O'Neill's work is amazing, particularly in the final 3D section (which is not a mere whim of the authors, but a perfectly timed option to drive the last nail in, so to speak).

Admittedly, the frame story involving Mina and Allan recovering the Dossier and escaping to the Blazing World was a little weak, especially when they finally arrive in Prospero's realm, but the real meat of the book is the actual Dossier. Moore is pitch-perfect in mimicking the styles of various periods from the history of the League. Especially good are his Jeeves vs. Cthulu story and the beatnik story, but the whole thing is masterful.My only real disappointment is that this should actually have been divided up into many more books.

But, it\u2019s an example of the kind of genius Moore has built his reputation on, and more than worth the effort of reading."}, {"userName": "Tedbrogan19", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4729255-tedbrogan19", "userReview": "\u201cNot thou alone, but all humanity doth in its progress fable emulate.

I enjoyed it and I didn't have the problems that many reviewers had with it. I like the League moving into the modern era, and I like finding out about the interim Leagues. What does it all mean, in the end? I can't say.

I have a theory that Moore wrote this just to mess with overeager fanboys who insist on pretending they love everything he does; it honestly feels like he's putting a lot of effort into making it totally unreadable. In which case, consider it a smashing success."}, {"userName": "Travis", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1086026-travis", "userReview": "Brilliant and exhausting.

First and foremost, let me tell you that the... assembled documents (so to speak) of the Black Dossier hold very little interest for anyone not exposed to at least the first two installments of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, also known as the Murray Group, after Mina Murray.What Alan Moore has done here, is use a number of different printed visual mediums, to outline the history of secretive extraordinary groups in Britain (and elsewhere), framed by an Inception-type story (although it came out 3 years before Inception), wherein Mina and Quatermain visit their old headquarters to reclaim the dossier you are reading and which they in turn are reading, which also talks of their exploits etc.Let me tell you, the aforementioned story is not very good, BUT 90% of the rest of the material is simply amazing, as it outlines not just Moore's LOEG universe, but also combines it with Greek Mythology, Lovecraft, Moorcock and more besides, to create a new mythic / historic timeline for Britain. There are things like a (fictional) government sanctioned Tijuana Bible (one of many jabs against the Thatcher era in the UK), a supposedly lost Shakespeare manuscript, Orlando's story mimicking the old Look & Learn Magazine comic strips, a Penny Dreadful on watercolor paper and more, all filled out with supposed MI-5 reports and commentary.There are also a couple of short stories, the best of which is a sort of satirical Lovecraftian tale and the worst of which is a misguided assortment of pages without any punctuation marks!All in all, if you are a fan of LOEG, this tome is very fulfilling and would be even more so if not for the completely pointless, trippy ending in the Blazing World, where Moore casts himself in the role of an other-dimensional Prospero (from Shakespeare's Tempest) and the whole thing is drawn in an epilepsy inducing style that may or may not be a form of 3D, if you have the dreaded red and green glasses of yore.It must be noted that, if nothing else, the Black Dossier showcases the vast and varied talent of Kevin O'Neil, who seems to effortlessly shift his style in order to mimic different eras and types of documents and artwork.At the very least, the Black Dossier is a must for the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen completionist."}], "description": "England in the mid 1950s is not the same as it was. The powers that be have instituted...some changes. The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen have been disbanded and disavowed, and the country is under the control of an iron-fisted regime. Now, after many years, the still youthful Mina Murray and a rejuvenated Allan Quatermain return and are in search of some answers. Answers that can only be found in a book buried deep in the vaults of their old headquarters, a book that holds the key to the hidden history of the League throughout the ages: The Black Dossier. As Allan and Mina delve into the details of their precursors, some dating back centuries, they must elude their dangerous pursuers who are Hell-bent on retrieving the lost manuscript... and ending the League once and for all.The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier is an elaborately designed, cutting edge volume that will include a Tijuana Bible insert and a 3-D section complete with custom glasses, as well as additional text pieces, maps, and a stunning, cutaway double page spread of Captain Nemo's Nautilus submarine by acclaimed LOEG artist Kevin O Neill.", "title": "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier\n      \n          (The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen #2.5)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/107009.The_League_of_Extraordinary_Gentlemen_Black_Dossier", "average": 3.45, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1371750898l/107009.jpg", "reviews": 413, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3961.Alan_Moore", "name": "Alan Moore"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/61919.Kevin_O_Neill", "name": "Kevin O'Neill"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/506243.Ray_Zone", "name": "Ray Zone"}], "type": ["Sequential Art", "Sequential Art", "Fantasy", "Fiction", "Comics"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/107009.The_League_of_Extraordinary_Gentlemen", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22571016-the-league-of-extraordinary-gentlemen", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/107010.Absolute_League_of_Extraordinary_Gentlemen", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/472331.Watchmen", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5805.V_for_Vendetta", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/96358.Batman", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/297627.The_League_of_Extraordinary_Gentlemen_Vol_1", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23529.From_Hell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19755140-embassytown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32858845-off-to-be-the-wizard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10931746-the-stepford-wives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13604418-the-long-earth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34111309-the-man-of-legends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193375-fellside", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204943-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18806963-prayers-to-broken-stones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18126623-2061", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29425329-alas-babylon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193696-3001", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18162904-dreams-and-shadows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35106805-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25353286-provenance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23249416-an-unwelcome-quest"]}
