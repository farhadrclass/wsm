Hard science fiction kind of wraps around on itself; when your technology becomes indistinguishable from magic, suddenly you\u2019ve entered a world of nanotechnological fantasy. \u201cThe Bees Her Heart, the Hive Her Belly\u201d echoes these sentiments. Benjanun Sriduangkaew, a nominee for this year\u2019s John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer, plays in a world where technology has advanced to a point that metaphor has become reality. The end result is a story so surreal its meaning starts to blur against the grainy background of the writing.This is a story about escape. Sennyi wants to get away, to find a sister that she has lost and that no one remembers because everyone these days is networked. So she accepts bees into her heart, into her body. The bees\u2014are they real bees? Are they metaphorical? Are they digital? Is this entire world some kind of holographic, computational, simulated existence? Sriduangkew dangles such possibilities in front of our faces and declines to answer these questions \u2026 but it doesn\u2019t really matter. Reading this story is like being perched on a lily pad floating down a river. It\u2019s a complacent experience, with the occasional tug on one\u2019s heartstrings.I like this kind of mixture of metaphor and reality\u2014in small doses. Were this a novel I\u2019d probably become frustrated. With longer plots, I need solid ground, something firm from which I can build a greater understanding. But short stories and novelettes are the perfect forms for this kind of writing. Sriduangkaew definitely brings a unique and talented voice to the conversation. Her characters are intriguing sketches of people with furtive, ulterior motives, hiding from organizations and entities that have sinister or even merely amoral aims. The lack of detail might be frustrating to some, but these broad strokes allow Sriduangkaew to orchestrate a very fulfilling, almost fairytale-like sense of whimsy.\u201cThe Bees Her Heart, the Hive Her Belly\u201d was a good start to my reading for this year\u2019s Hugo and Cambell Awards. I\u2019m quite happy to have had the chance to encounter a new, good writer I haven\u2019t heard of before."}, {"userName": "Jeff Stockett", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2950483-jeff-stockett", "userReview": "This story is weird. Weird isn't necessarily bad, but in this case I didn't feel like it was fleshed out enough. When things are weird, they require more explaining so that the reader can understand what is going on. I felt like I was on the edge of understanding the entire time I was reading it. Things like installing some sort of prosthetic bee hive in your chest just don't make sense. How does that work? What is the motivation? Later we find out that the bee hive hides you from the internet. Again, how does that make any sense?There were some neat concepts here, things like having everyone's mind sync with the internet so that memories can actually be deleted from the collective consciousness. That's cool stuff, and potentially terrifying. But, overall, I just didn't feel like it was very well executed."}, {"userName": "Jon", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3445389-jon", "userReview": "This was weird. Weird in the way that Iron Sunrise and Mechanique: A Tale of the Circus Tresaulti were. It was a weird mix of biotech and cyberpunk. I didn't love it, but at times it brought a smile to my face.Sriduangkaew is a nominee for the 2014 Campbell Award for Best New Writer, and this story was included in the voter packet. I preferred it to Fade to Gold, but I'm still not enthused to vote for her."}, {"userName": "Chris Cutler", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2652771-chris-cutler", "userReview": "Compared the other works by this author, this one actually worked for me. The ending was less bleak, the characters made more sense, and the bizarre qualities were introduced less disruptively than in, for example, Silent Bridge, Pale Cascade. Reading that work first did allow me to recognize that this takes place in the same wider universe, and therefore appreciate some of the similarities and differences, but I do think this stands on its own."}, {"userName": "Tammy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/122617-tammy", "userReview": "I get a similar feeling from everything I read by Benjanun Sriduangkaew. I think it's beautiful, just gorgeously written and rich with layers of meaning, but ultimately I walk away thinking I didn't quite understand the point of the story. That's not a fault in Sriduangkaew's writing which, I stress, I find lovely. It's something in me that makes me unable at this time to connect with their works."}, {"userName": "Althea Ann", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3846743-althea-ann", "userReview": "In a far-future, a woman traumatized by the loss of the memories of her dearest sister makes some radical decisions and joins a cult based around bizarre and dangerous bio-modification. Gradually, unexpected layers of motivation and intention are revealed. Hmm. That description makes the story sound significantly less weird than it is. It's a very odd and original story. Very good writing, but I found it a little inaccessible, emotionally, where it felt it ought to be strong."}, {"userName": "Kat", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29562-kat", "userReview": "Strange, but I wound up liking it quite a lot.
