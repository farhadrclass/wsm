Drink a toast to this one, and make it a Kokanee, the popular beer out here in the Kootenays where the story takes place. Meet the sleuth: Bern Fortin has retired from the Canadian Armed Forces to the small town of Kootenay Landing. His past includes harrowing tours of duty in Rwanda, Bosnia and Afghanistan. In his new life he hopes to heal his soul by learning to garden, and expiate his survival guilt by bearing witness for the dead: he has a part time job as a coroner. To the job he brings a soldier's sharp instincts, as well as a struggle with PTSD. Bern is a wonderful character. Likable and complex, his outsider status in a small Western town is made even more obvious by the fact that he is originally a Francophone. Like so many fictional crime solvers he has a nosy neighbour who fusses over him, the formidable Mrs K., short for Kalesnikoff. Named not for the gun but for the sawmill, a real family-owned business thriving just West of Nelson. The town may be fictional, the location is real. The description of place and local culture adds real depth to the novel. The story is set in a brewery. A worker has gone into a confined space by himself to fix a machine and come to a rather horrid ending. His death is a blow to the safety manager, whose rigid protocol should have prevented the accident. Or was it an accident? Could there be a connection between the death and some games played by corporate management? There is the usual thriller stuff with the usual build-up of suspense and surprise ending. It is all well done. Evie, the safety manager, is a well developed secondary character, a combination of damsel in distress and fellow sleuth. I hope this novel is the first of many."}, {"userName": "Sharlene", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7424302-sharlene", "userReview": "I received this book as the result of a Good Reads giveaway.Let me start off by saying that I only hand a book to my hubby when I know he might enjoy it. At most, he may see six books a year from me, all of them fantasy related. You can imagine his surprise when I thrust a book at him that is totally off his genre choice. His eyebrows raised, he read the back cover. He looked back to me and said,\"Interesting.\"Interesting is a pretty weak word when it comes to describing this book. Captivating, intriguing and dabbling in romance, it keeps the reader on their toes throughout the entire novel. With an action packed climax I was unable to set it down regardless of the migraine I was personally fighting!The main characters Evie and Bern are strong and intelligent and extremely easy to believe. I do hope that Collier continues on with these characters in a future book or series. It seems that even they have their own secrets that need to tell a story. I also have hopes of a movie deal for Deryn Collier as this was amazing!Be warned though, that some of the images of the murders may be graphic for some. Personally, it left a picture in my head for a few days and a greater respect for breweries and the safety procedures that are in place. Bravo for a great book...One that is not \"interesting\" but is dynamic, enthralling and will keep you rivetted from start to finish."}, {"userName": "Rio", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7654820-rio", "userReview": "Wow!

I broke one of my rules and bought this book while not having read any others by this author but the blurbs sounded good and I'm trying to read any books that sound like my type and have won or been shortlisted for Arthur Ellis awards. In this case I didn't get burned as I quite enjoyed this story even though it has a few flaws. Most of the key characters are fairly well developed and the setting in the Kootenays is well described but I really didn't think that that setting played as big a role in the story as it could have but I kind of felt the story could have taken place in any small town with essentially only one major employer. Actually the Bugaboo Brewery itself is one of the main characters in the story. Personally I didn't like Evie all that much as I thought that while she is supposed to be so smart and well educated and competent she sure did a lot of dumb things and put herself into a lot of dangerous situations. Mrs. K is a great character but I thought she should have had a much larger presence in the story. Bern Fortin is a very complex and likeable person even while carrying some heavy baggage and this leads to one of the big flaws that has caused me to downrate the book. I don't think it helped this story to have Bern's backstory dragged on and on only to be left open with the cliffhanger non-ending which seems to me that, along with the whole Col. Sauve thing, is just an excuse to force a reader to buy the next book. And, sorry, as much as I want to read \"Open Secret\" $13.99 CD is just too much for an eBook so I'll have to wait for it to be on sale for a reasonable price or I can get a freebie or a loaner. Also if the little hint of Bern's trouble in Rwanda that we are given is true I can't see what all his big troubles are about anyway. Now for my next pet peeve which caused me to downrate this book a bit more. I am finding that it is becoming quite common in crime novels to have the perp die in some way before he/she could be hauled into the justice system with the very common method being a fall from some cliff, bridge, high building or machinery. Very quick, easy. convenient way to end a story BUT really lazy writing. Of course in this case there are more than one suspected perp and only one dies so i guess it's not quite as bad a fault but I still don't like it. Actually the \"chase?\" scene through the brewery leading to the arrest made a pretty exiting, suspenseful and solid ending. And, oh yeah, we never did find out how many ribbons Bern and Mrs. K won at the fair so another loose end. Still was a good read though."}, {"userName": "Ellen Dark", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3331140-ellen-dark", "userReview": "I enjoyed the first Bren Fortin mystery.

Coroner ,and former soldier, Bern Fortin is a deeply damaged but immediately likable hero, who sees his job as a duty; a duty to the dead. Another reviewer commented that Bern reminder her of a young Romeo Dallaire, and that is precisely the image I had as I read \u2013 a combination of inner strength, compassion, and keen intelligence, all coloured by a traumatic past. Collier has created a character that will leave readers wanting to know more long after the final page. Safety Officer Evie Chappelle is the perfect counter/companion to Bern. Their secrets and their inner lives, combined with their natural attraction, makes the sexual and romantic tension between these two buzz. What impressed me most, however, was how effectively Collier used location in this story, and how accurately she portrayed life in the mountains of British Columbia. What makes the deaths in Confined Space so impactful is not just the \u2018how\u2019 or \u2018who\u2019, but the \u2018where\u2019. In a small town, such as Kootenay Landing, where everyone knows everyone\u2019s business, a single death can impact the entire community. A murder? Unthinkable. Kootenay Landing is its own character. A refuge for some, a trap for others. Breathtaking natural beauty contrasted with a gritty, blue collar population. As with so many small towns, its life hinges on the success or failure of a single industry \u2013 the brewery, in this case. A threat to the brewery is a threat to everyone, and so the stakes are high from the moment a dead body is discovered in the bottle washer, and continue to climb.Even if you\u2019re not a fan of this genre, I highly recommend Confined Space for its characters and setting alone. For mystery/thriller lovers, the story is well-paced , plausible and suspenseful. I am eager to read more about Bern and to find out if he ever learns to grow tomatoes as good as Mrs. K\u2019s!"}, {"userName": "Stacey Cornelius", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8570298-stacey-cornelius", "userReview": "We know small towns have secrets. Sometimes horrifying secrets. But that doesn't stop us from being seduced by an idyllic setting, or from hoping there are no dark places hiding in the picturesque.The sleepy mountain town of Kootenay Landing is the setting for Deryn Collier's debut mystery, Confined Space. She chooses an unlikely location - a brewery - for a pair of unlikely deaths. A man dies in an apparent accident while repairing a bottle-washing tank, and his abducted girlfriend, kept captive in the same building, dies while attempting to escape.Enter former soldier turned part-time coroner Bern Fortin. He's a man with heavy burdens: post traumatic stress disorder, one of his men awaiting trial for an unexplained crime, and a journalist digging into his past.The townspeople surrounding Fortin are just as complex as they are ordinary, and Collier draws them with the skill that comes from a deep understanding of the human condition. For better or worse, they are as real as our own neighbours.As for the mystery, Collier has constructed an engrossing plot that kept me up at night wanting to know what would happen next. There are no car chases here, no blood-curdling screams, and no obvious answers. The scale is utterly human, and the everyday Collier deftly weaves into the book - Bern Fortin sharing breakfast with his neighbour, tending his vegetable garden - makes the undiscovered murderer all the more menacing.There are turns that are entirely unexpected, which is what every mystery reader craves. I will reveal nothing, and as someone who routinely blurts out lines before a character utters them, I don't mind admitting Collier delivered some genuine surprises.The ending of Confined Space leaves plenty of unanswered questions. I have no qualms about the quality of sequels here. I'm eagerly anticipating the next installment."}, {"userName": "Kyle", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2409338-kyle", "userReview": "This was offered to me by a co-worker of mine, who also happens to be the author's relative. I was intrigued by the concept and setting: a gruesome murder takes place in the Kokanee mountain brewery in Creston BC (names changed of course). While it had its moments, I can't say the novel was particularly gripping or polished. For one thing, the characters need a lot of work. The two protagonists are about as complex as cardboard, and really have no business tag-teaming as Mulder and Scully (a Provincial coroner and a safety policy manager are your heroes? Really??). The bad guy, when \"revealed\", is a caricature that doesn't fit the crimes. The supporting cast are all either country bumpkins or your typical \"uncooperative person with troubled and secretive past\", and none of them seemed to think it strange or unusual when suspicious things kept happening. (Dead people piling up around the brewery? No big deal, it's business at usual!) And the clues that are revealed are quite mundane and seemingly irrelevant to anyone without experience working in a brewery. I guess that's why we needed that safety manager, hey?I read this expecting a good murder mystery that showed off the scenic Kootenay landscape, but honestly this book makes half of Creston sound like they belong in a penitentiary. (Maybe I need to stay out of Creston...) I do think there is potential here for some good future hard-boiled Canadian crime fiction, but the author shouldn't write so closely to the chest (she used to work at Kokanee brewery... as a safety manager). I'll wait and see what her next novel has in store. Hopefully with a whole different cast!Lastly, as a parting suggestion, if you're going to hold your murder mystery inside a brewery, the story should always end with the bad guy drowning in a vat of beer.

The reasons surrounding his retirement are somewhat shrouded in mystery and relate back to his tour of duty in Africa.I don't know quite what to make of the coroner. Fortin is not a tough guy, like Jack Reacher. However, like Reacher, he is a man reinventing himself outside of the military. I like that about him and I wanted to know more. He is a man troubled by his past, but not held captive by it. He is smart, likes his neighbor, likes to garden, but how and why he ended up as a coroner are still unclear at the end of the story. The story itself, which takes place in a brewery run by a mega-corporation, was decent, and there were a few good moments of tension, both criminal and romantic. What I did find particularly interesting was Collier's take on the inner scheming that goes on inside corporations. Having worked for the Target corporation for quite a few years, Collier nailed the ingenuousness of corporate life from superficial compliance with government regulations, to anyone and everyone being dispensable.Bern Fortin is a likable lead character, likable enough to read the next story he's featured in. As a writer, Collier crafted a good story. It flowed nicely, held together well and she did a good job juggling the main story and several sub-plots.

C. Kootenays. He is living next door to an elderly Russian lady who is teaching him how to grow and preserve his vegetables. He is finding peace in this hobby as his past army experiences while serving in Afghanistan and Africa frequently come back to haunt him. Bern has obtained a job as the local coroner. Most of his cases are fairly routine until he is called to the local brewery where an employee has been found dead. At first, it seems like an employee error, a fairly new worker not following the basic rules of working alone. But when a few days later, the employee's girlfriend is found dead in the nearby field, Bern begins to suspect otherwise. Evie is the safety officer at the Brewery and she begins a friendship with him. Evie, like Bern is suspicious of the recent deaths, even though the local RCMP officer thinks otherwise. When subsequent events put Evie's life at risk, the suspicion increases. This book is a great debut by this author, kept me in suspense as to how it was going to turn out. Throughout the book, Bern receives e-mails from one of his soldiers who served under him in Afghanistan. This soldier is being held in jail and is requesting Ben's assistance in helping him being released. This added to the mystery of Bern's past. Obviously this is not the only book, this author will be writing with this character.

Bern Fortin is tough and smart, but haunted by ghosts of his past. Once I opened the cover I was hooked - Confined Space sucked me into the world of Fortin and Evie Chapelle and the goings-on in the Bugaboo Brewery. Collier has a unique voice and a nice way with a plot. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Caroline Ingvaldsen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3652185-caroline-ingvaldsen", "userReview": "First of the Bern Fortin Novels, a suspenseful mystery haunted by the spectre of war and enhanced by a charming West Coast setting featuring an appealing protagonist, formerly a Canadian Forces commander, currently a country coroner."}, {"userName": "Elden", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7677690-elden", "userReview": "I got this book from a goodreads giveaway and I am very glad I read it. This is not a book I would normally read as it is a murder mystery but I found it very well written and will definitely be looking for the next novel written by Deryn Collier."}], "description": "When respected ex\u2013Canadian Forces commander Bern Fortin cuts short his military career to take a job as the coroner for a small mountain town in the heart of BC, he\u2019s hoping to leave the past behind. Bern\u2019s looking forward to a quiet life, but the memories of what he witnessed during his stints in Afghanistan and other war-torn countries haunt him still. When the body of one of the workers is found floating in the huge bottle-washing tank at the local brewery, Bern is called in for a routine investigation. What first appears to be a tragic accident takes a menacing turn when the body of the worker\u2019s girlfriend is discovered in a nearby field. Bern needs the help of brewery safety investigator Evie Chapelle, who, burdened by tragedies she might have prevented, is more determined than ever to keep her workers, and their tight-knit community, safe. Soon, Bern and Evie find themselves risking their jobs\u2014and their lives\u2014to uncover a killer hiding in a place where it is awfully hard to keep a secret. Deryn Collier\u2019s debut novel is a taut mystery full of suspense.
