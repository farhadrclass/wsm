Turns out that a good laugh at my country's expense is exactly what I needed right about now.Before you pick up this book, make sure of two things:1) You know what you're about to read. This is a silly, lighthearted historical comedy, full of Monty Python-style jokes, puns and mockery. I also thought the story was very well-executed, but don't be expecting a high-angst drama (beyond the comical variety).2) Be in the mood for it. Like I said, it's a very specific type of book and it won't suit everyone. I usually prefer tension, action and \"oh shit, what's going to happen next\" books. But I sat down to read this wanting something funny, entertaining and undemanding. That's what I got.If you meet those two requirements, there's really nothing to dislike. This book does exactly what it promises and it does it very well. It's the kind of laugh snort embarrassingly out loud story that will get you some strange looks from other people. I just couldn't stop giggling to myself.\n\u201cI asked him to change back to talk to me, but he won\u2019t,\u201d Jane said. \u201cIt\u2019s disrespectful to remain a horse in the bedchamber, I should think.\u201d\nThis is a Tudor retelling set during the reign of the young Edward VI. In this reimagining, instead of the infamous divide between Protestants and Catholics (fostered by Henry VIII's disregard for the Catholic church), we see a war between Verities and E\u00f0ians. The latter have the power to shapeshift into various animals, and the former hate them for it.Mocking sexist attitudes and the ridiculous social graces of the 16th Century upper classes, the story unveils the \"true story\" about Lady Jane Grey - the one that history has hidden from us.\nShe was a woman who wore pants. She couldn\u2019t be trusted.\nI've already said that it's very funny, but for such a light, silly book, it is remarkably well-plotted. The story itself, behind the quips and hilarity, is compelling and features all kinds of royal backstabbing, secrets and craziness.It is a warm, lovable, over-the-top rewriting of history and I enjoyed every minute of it. Unlike most funny books, the humour remains constant throughout, never running dry or feeling forced. I only hope this trio of authors continue to write comedy together. Because it dazzles.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store"}, {"userName": "Lola  Reviewer", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14596170-lola-reviewer", "userReview": "It\u2019s not easy to write a review for a book when said book is tightly held against your chest.My Lady Jane is wonderful and so, so magical I want to keep it close to me for an indefinite amount of time.You might wonder: Three authors\u2026 three different point of views\u2026 three stories intertwined? How will that play out? Comically, apparently.This key to having a great time with this beautiful piece of fiction is to not take it too seriously.Sometimes absurd, sometimes silly but always charming, My Lady Jane will NOT let you fall into boredom.The chapters are brimming with humour, romance, adventure and absolutely delightful characters!It\u2019s said to be an alternative fantasy story of Lady Jane Grey, and while I am not a fan of historical fiction, I adored this one to bits.As I said earlier, it\u2019s not meant to be taken seriously. Really, it\u2019s all for your entertainment and the many changes that were made to Lady Jane Grey\u2019s real story are so interesting because they\u2019re original and unexpected and definitely diverting.For a book that was written by three different authors, they certainly nailed the point of views. The writing flowed. There is no abrupt change in the writing style; everything is smoothly done.It works. Everything does: the not-so-proper-to-the-century writing style (\u2014the word \u2018\u2018vampire\u2019\u2019 clearly didn\u2019t exist during that era!), the light atmosphere, the shape-shifting element, the many dangers and adventures and awkward yet fun situations the characters are put in.I never read The Princess Bride before (though I am not unfamiliar with the movie adaptation) but knowing they have much in common automatically places it to the top of my TBR pile!One last thought: It\u2019s very rare for me to read five hundred pages this fast, but it's hard not to breeze through My Lady Jane. Even putting it down for a second will not be an easy thing to do.Blog | Youtube | Twitter | Instagram | Google+ | Bloglovin\u2019"}, {"userName": "Katerina", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5014021-katerina", "userReview": "It was amusing. It was romantic. It was slightly based on medieval history. And it was a gem.I'm dancing like a happy ferret!\n\n\u201cYou may think you know the story. It goes like this: once upon a time, there was a sixteen-year old girl named Jane Grey, who was forced to marry a complete stranger (Lord Guildford or Gilford or Gifford-something-or-other), and shortly thereafter found herself ruler of a country. She was queen for nine days. Then she quite literally lost her head.\u201d\n\nAs the authors kindly inform us, that is not the story they narrate us. The original story is flat and a little morbid (unless you're enjoying beheadings-in that case I can recommend you some great TV shows). My Lady Jane though is refreshing. It takes place in a divided England, only religion is not the cause of this division. There are shapeshifters and the ones-who-hate-shapeshifters-and-want-to-burn-them-alive-or-chop-their-heads-whatever-just-kill-them. There is a spoiled king who doesn't want to die before being kissed. There is a feisty girl who loves books better than people (no it's not me in case you're wondering) and a boy that spends his days as a horse and villains who want the throne for themselves and outlaws and everything you could ask for from a historical fiction/ fantasy/ comedic book. That's why I'm still dancing like a happy ferret.The first thing that occured to me as I started reading My Lady Jane was that Jane's books' titles reminded me of The Sims Medieval. The second was that since Jane's mother was Frances Brandon Grey, her grandfather was the first Duke of Suffolk, Charles Brandon. Which means that this was her grandfather.That lucky bitch.After recovering from the shock that I'm reading about Henry Cavill's descendant, I recalled everything I know about british history (knowledge acquired by watching every historical television series and searching Wikipedia for hours) and I realized I didn't mind the changes! In fact, I preferred the changes! The writing trio did a marvelous job, there was not a single moment I wanted to put the book down! The sarcastic and hilarious narration, the conspiracies, the strong-minded female characters and the swoonworthy steed are My Lady Jane's trademarks, and I kept giggling and swooning and thanking the book gods for this creation! Three authors yet you could not possibly tell, their writing was flawless, fluid and utterly enjoyable! Do not expect a thought-provoking, life-altering book, but you'll love it nonetheless!\n\n\u201cThrough books she could see the world.\u201d\n\nJane, Edward and Gifford (you can call him G, I call him my lord husband). Three different but equally fascinating (and stubborn) characters that will seize your heart from the start! Jane is undoubtedly the main one (you know, My Lady Jane), and you can't help but relate to her, especially when it comes to her precious books! She's the book girl, supporter of the weak, and does not tolerate male authority. Which means she constantly fights with my her husband G, the husband she hated (and unfairly judged) at first but later she couldn't help but fall in love with, because he has that effect. My only problem with her was that she thought she could do everything alone (when she couldn't) and would never listen to the voice of reason when it came to her safety. Obviously it's a trait that every YA heroine shares, regardless the time setting and the circumstances.In My Lady Jane, Cynthia Hand, Brodi Ashton and Jodi Meadows combine their divine writing powers (a gift from the book gods if you ask me), which result into a story full of humor, romance, magic and adventure that will make you smile and wish that school history books were written in the same fashion!I'm off to dance like a happy ferret!"}, {"userName": "Wendy Darling", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2745288-wendy-darling", "userReview": "4.5 stars This revisionist retelling of Lady Jane Grey's brief reign and romance shouldn't work--but it does! It's deliriously dotty and clever, with affectionate nods to great absurdist historical comedies like THE PRINCESS BRIDE, Monty Python, and even, I think, Black Adder and LADYHAWKE. The ridiculously punny humor had me giggling from beginning to end.It's also superbly well-crafted, especially considering the three POVs were written by three different authors, and the historical details and context are inserted with just the right touch. Most notably, the strict mores and sexism of the time are observed and acknowledged before they are slyly subverted, particularly in the fantastically endearing and capable women (only one of whom wields a weapon). It's hard to believe a tragic moment in history could be turned into such a delightful confection of joyous alternate history, but The Lady Janies have done it. Review to come.

I was expecting semi-serious historical fiction, but it's more like the Monty Python version of the drama between Henry VIII's kids.I don't want to ruin any of the plot, so I'll just say this book is hilarious. Basically, the story starts out adding its own twist on history, but then ends up chucking history out the window and rewriting a happier ending for King Edward VI, Lady Jane Grey, and Lord Guildford Dudley. All of the familiar faces like Elizabeth I, Bloody Mary, and Mary Queen of Scots are featured. And the new ending could totally still fit in with actual history.There were SO many hilarious references and actual lines pulled straight out of Monty Python and The Princess Bride. And Gifford's character kept coming up with a ton of Shakespeare's future lines. The way everything fit together was so incredibly clever. The romance and action were even well done... I have zero complaints. I would 100% read this kind of story for every executed monarch throughout history.

Indeed it is, because that book is My Lady Jane.When I first heard about it, I was skeptical. A comical retelling of Lady Jane Grey, written by three different authors? It sounded like a recipe for disaster. As it turned out, I've never read a better co-authored novel. The writing flowed so I couldn't tell the authors apart and the chapters transitioned smoothly.The plot was absolutely hilarious and witty. The comparisons to The Princess Bride were spot on. I appreciated that the humor wasn't silly or crude (as I was afraid it would be), but clever and sarcastic.Meet Jane. She's about to marry a total stranger since her cousin, Edward VI, is dying, and she's next in line for the throne, but all Jane wants to do is read her books. Meanwhile, Edward has problems of his own to worry about - there are plots to overthrow him, he's slowly dying of \"the Affliction,\" and he's never even kissed a girl!There were ties to the original Jane Grey story, but the world was changed so that the courts raging against each other were \"Verities\" and \"E\u00f0ians.\" E\u00f0ians are people who possess the power to shape-shift into animals, but there are those in the court who deem them \"beasts\" and believe they should be burned at the stake.\nSo. Her husband was a horse.And no one had told her.\nI loved the slow-burn romance. Jane and Gifford, otherwise known as \"G,\" were total strangers upon their first meeting (at their wedding) and hated each other. Of course, they gradually learned to tolerate one another, though there were too many infuriating almost-kisses in my opinion (The Lady Janies could be so cruel!).\nIn their bedchamber, Jane set a pillow and blanket on the floor next to the bed.\u201cJane, I cannot allow you to sleep on the floor,\u201d G said gallantly.She smiled. \u201cThe pillow and blanket are for you, my lord.\u201d\nFrom a book I didn't expect much from, this turned out to be absolutely magical, adventurous, and heartwarming.

Like seriously so giddy. I was always laughing out-loud which was completely awkward when you are standing in line at the check out, let me tell you.If you are in need of a laugh and a light read, read this book I beg you.If you are in need of a feminist-like book, read this book I beg you.If you are in need of a history lesson, read this book I beg you.Seriously this is about Queen Jane's reign of like, what, nine days? I am not too sure, since I am not an expert on the matter, but these author's are. They did their homework and found out the very (not so) truth of what happened in that time with Queen Jane.Young King Edward is dying. He caught a tragic disease. He's never been kissed and all he has in the world are his two darling sisters, his beautiful cousin Jane and his dog, Pet (how original, I know). Since he doesn't have any children, his throne would go to his sister Mary, unfortunately, until one of his advisers gives him another idea...Jane is the Belle of the story. The girl who just wants to read books (so, you know, all of us) and then read some more books and then HER MOTHER MARRIES HER OFF TO A GUY WHO TURNS INTO A HORSE (That's the beast, if you weren't catching on). She is mortified, humiliated and NOT HAPPY. HE IS A HORSE WHAT IN BLAZES IS SHE SUPPOSE TO DO WITH A HORSE.Said horse, Gifford, can't control that by day he is a steed and by night he is a man. And why does she always have her nose in a book anyway? Is she not pleasant looking? Heaven forbids he marries someone who looks like an animal.Gifford belongs to a group of people called E\u00f0ian (eth-y-un). They have two different forms. But they are hated by those who don't. I kind of got the whole Protestants and Catholics feel from the tension between the two groups.And that's all I am going to say to you. You should know the gist of this story (it is history, you know) but a lot of the major details were missed in the history books. You'll have to read this book to know the (not so) truth.So if you fit in any of the categories listed above (needs a laugh, likes equality, history buff) then you should read this book.

Now this book is about the Tudors which were quite known as England's most notorious dynasty. What I love about this book is its captivating writing style and the charming characters. It was a delightful, exciting, magical, and hilarious book. When I read this book, I became curious on what really happened to lady Jane Grey's reign for nine freaking days! I was also intrigued about her life and her adorable husband's life. I read the true story and I was amazed because the authors managed to recreate the history. They added humor, magic, adventure, and romance which made this book absolutely phenomenal. The authors combined their genius minds and impressive writing skills to come up with a bloody brilliant book.Let's talk about Lady Jane. I like her character because she's headstrong, stubborn, smart, and of course, she's a bookworm. But what really made me fall in love with this book is Gifford Dudley or \"G\" for short. He's a gentleman. He's also smart, kind, charming, and funny. I also liked this book because the two main characters were kind of falls to the category of \"enemies to lovers\". Their romantic relationship developed slowly. It was such a tease in a really good way.All in all, this book was romantic, sweet, touching, witty, enchanting, and really incredible.

Edward  : a teenage king suffering from the Affliction, with only a year to live and the poor boy hasn\u2019t even had his first kiss. it\u2019s a sad life for Edward, who decides;  Life is short. And then you die.  not gonna lie, from the looks of things, he was a horrible king, but like I FELT BAD FOR MY BOY. And like who to trust when everyone\u2019s against ya? so glad he pulled through. yeah yeah he was anti feminist but that\u2019s to be expected in that era, and he changed so it\u2019s alllll good.  Jane  : so like, I think I expected to like her a lot more than I ended up liking her. she wasn\u2019t exactly the most... intriguing? like i was kinda done with her bs near the end of the book. and like, I get she wasn\u2019t expected to be reading YA fantasy but her obsession with books about literally everything wasn\u2019t exactly relatable. but like. she treats her books well. that\u2019s always nice.  Gifford  : when I say I love horses... I mean all horses except for Edians. kinda ruined the vibe for me, didn\u2019t you G? and to think that he was actually ok with the nickname G? like noooope your Gifford Dudley in my book still, son. Needless to say; I didn\u2019t really like him all that much.  BESS  : YOU SEE THAT ALL CAPS? it\u2019s cause I actually loved her and needed more from her! Queen ELIZABETH?? my lack of history knowledge made that a plot twist folks, and I loved it. Like I literally. Wish. There. Was. More. Bess. She just seemed so smart & fit to be queen, so bless u Edward.  Gracie  : yeah, nope. I\u2019m done with \u201cI can\u2019t forget you\u2019re king\u201d bc like the boys in front of you with peasant clothes and he could be executed any minute I do not believe this counts as being king. I did like the narration a lot though! I could hear the British voice going through my head as I read , and it added a load to the experience. In the end... I was just lacking some, like, realistic aspects? Like in the end everyone was an Edian? and somehow things always worked out in the favour of our fav trio. Like I thought there was going to be some excitement, especially when they were fighting the mythical bear but... nope. The fantasy was just stupid to be honest. Also... I\u2019m no history person, I took the required credit in grade 10 and that\u2019s about it, so I can\u2019t say much about the accuracy. But technically speaking, it\u2019s not supposed to be that accurate, right? This did make me laugh though. You really have to read it for yourself, but it\u2019s super light and entertaining. Like don\u2019t expect executions and gory history and crazy fantasy - read this book when you\u2019re ready to have some fun, relax, and read about (mostly Edward) but Lady Jane :) Now I actually have an interest in her beheading and I\u2019m going to do some research !! \u2014\u2014 okay WHAT THE HECK I was  not  expecting to like this so much but I did !!

After thinking (my brain still hurts) I decided to not overthink (huh, it's a little bit late for that?) and propose you to read a summery the authors have written for this book. Seriously, they've done all the work and I don't get why book sites don't put their annotation on the book's page? Now, the reading of the summary below is strictly mandatory; everyone who will refuse to read it will be hunted and burned at stake (with hay and torches and stuff (have to google what they used for pyres back in the 16th century). \nNow, stop babbling, Nastassja, and get to action already!The authors' summary (it's actually the book's prologue, but I am sure it can be used as a summery):You may think you know the story. It goes like this: once upon a time, there was a sixteen-year-old girl named Jane Grey, who was forced to marry a complete stranger (Lord Guildford or Gilford or Gifford-something-or-other), and shortly thereafter found herself ruler of a country. She was queen for nine days. Then she quite literally lost her head.Yes, it\u2019s a tragedy, if you consider the disengagement of one\u2019s head from one\u2019s body tragic. (We are merely narrators, and would hate to make assumptions as to what the reader would find tragic.)We have a different tale to tell.Pay attention. We\u2019ve tweaked minor details. We\u2019ve completely rearranged major details. Some names have been changed to protect the innocent (or not-so-innocent, or simply because we thought a name was terrible and we liked another name better). And we\u2019ve added a touch of magic to keep things interesting. So really anything could happen.This is how we think Jane\u2019s story should have gone.It begins in England (or an alternate version of England, since we\u2019re dealing with the manipulation of history), in the middle of the sixteenth century. It was an uneasy time, especially if you were an E\u2202ian (pronounced eth-ee-uhn for those of you unfamiliar with the term). The E\u2202ians were blessed (or cursed, depending on your point of view) with the ability to switch between a human form and an animal one. For instance, certain members of the general public could turn themselves into cats, which greatly increased the country\u2019s tuna-fish consumption, but also cut down on England\u2019s rat population. (Then again, other individuals could turn into rats, so nobody really noticed.)There were those who thought that this animal magic was terrific, but others who saw it as an abomination that needed to be eradicated immediately. That second group (known as Verities) believed that human beings had no business being anything other than human beings. And because Verities were largely in charge of everything, E\u2202ians were persecuted and hunted until most of them died out or went deep into hiding.Which brings us to one fateful afternoon in the royal court of England, when King Henry VIII, during a fit of rage, transformed into a great lion and devoured the court jester, much to the audience\u2019s delight. They clapped enthusiastically, for no one really liked the jester. (Later, the courtiers discovered the incident was not a rehearsed act of artful deception, but indeed an actual lion masticating the jester. When the audience found out the truth they no longer clapped, but they did remark, \u201cThat clown had it coming.\u201d)That very night, King Henry, once he\u2019d returned to his human form, decreed that E\u2202ians weren\u2019t so bad after all, and henceforth should enjoy the same rights and privileges as Verities. The decision to sanction the ancient magic made waves across Europe. The head of the Verity Church was not pleased with King Henry\u2019s decision, but every time Rome sent a missive denouncing the decree, the Lion King ate the messenger.Hence the phrase, Don\u2019t eat the messenger.When Henry died, his only son, Edward, inherited the throne. Our story begins in the middle of tense times, with an increasing animosity brewing between E\u2202ians and Verities, a teenage king with a tenuous grasp on the throne of England, and a young lord and lady who have no idea their destinies are about to collide.Totally against their will.Finally, you know what the story is about and we can talk business. As you have probably noticed by the summery, this book is going to be hilarious. Every page of the story is filled with humor and irony, which do not border on vulgarity or toilet humor. You want an intelligent humor? You got it! It's the best treat this book has, and, honestly, it's not often I encounter funny books in YA (I can really count such books on my two hands), and, sadly, not every book can portrait real history (with minor changes, or course) and events that weren't so funny, after all, in an ironic way that makes us look at it under a different angle. I can only applaud to the authors and how magnificently they expressed their collected voice in this book.\u201cMy lord, I will leave you to properly attire yourself. A carriage is waiting to take us to our honeymoon.\u201d (The word honeymoon was quite new at this point in history, and actually involved a month\u2019s supply of mead for the newlyweds rather than a romantic getaway, but for the sake of delicate sensibilities, we\u2019ll pretend honeymoon meant then what it does now.)\nPet was on the other side, snarling and biting at those who would follow (gosh, we love that dog)\n(Okay, so we told you that anybody could die at any time, and you seem like you\u2019re getting worried, but Pet\u2019s fine. <...> Trust us: we\u2019re not the type of narrators who would kill a dog.)\nThey collapsed into each other, and although it would be indelicate to detail what happened next, these narrators will tell you that a \u201cvery special hug\u201d does not begin to describe it.P.S. They totally consummated.Look, how smartly they inserted remarks and clarification on certain events and words that after a while you wait for such remarks to appear and clarify something else for you, because it's simply fun, and you like authors' voice so much, you want more of it: it creates the illusion of watching a play in the theater.Aside from the awesome approach with the history material, this book gave us wonderful characters, which according to history books (you won't find those anywhere in public places, because they are highly encrypted and kept in a far far away lands... but I give you my word: they contain only the truth) invented such things as using a pan to bash someone's head (yup, Disney Rapunzel wasn't the first to think of such useful thing) and invented an arm-stretch move on a young woman and ect. and ect. (I will need hours to count all inventions, really). Such a creative creatures these characters. Here's the cast:\n a horse\n\n\na kestrel\n\n\na ferret\n\n\na fox\n\n\na skunk\n\nI know, I know, I can guess what you are about to say, \"What the... animal planet you are showing us?!\" But it is the real cast of this book, though I can't tell you who is who: you'll have to read the book to find out. But for one character I can make a disclosure, because his special condition is mentioned in the first chapter, so you will not have to wait long to meet him (look at the beautiful chestnut horse on the first picture). G (his name is Gifford but he - by the obvious reasons - prefers to be called G) has an equestrian situation and literary turns into horse from every sunrise till every sunset. With the perks of being a horse other things apply, such as eating hay (but he prefers apples, really), um, manure and horse rules such as: do not ride the horse, do not tell horse jokes, do not bridle the horse... agh, too many rules for one horse, don't you think? Not an easy life I can assure you. As for our other characters (and we have three main characters as you already guessed: one for every author from our lovely team of ladies), they too have a couple of surprises to show you (and they can't wait for you to start the book) and a very exciting tale to tell.So here's my verdict, folks: if you want a funny (a veryyyyy funny) story to read, and reliable headstrong characters to meet, and to learn the real version of English history - READREADREADREADREADREADREADREADREADREADREADREAD My Lady Jane (the pyre is still burning if you were wondering, no pressure here) and get your dose of fun that will stay with you for a long time after you finish and close the book. P.S. I couldn't leave you without mentioning that the heroine in whose honor this book is named - Jane - is a huge lover of books (she is also a 16 years-old spinster and a redhead and as you can imagine the combination is not a very good one for the 16th century England, but, hey, the girl does really know how to use a pan occasionally). Now I am really off to do... stuff *curtsies and vanishes behind the curtain*"}, {"userName": "Heather 'Bookables'", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5376236-heather-bookables", "userReview": "LOVED THIS BOOK!

Completely off-the-wall AU fanfiction, of the variety that's often known derisively as \"crackfics.\" It was terrible fanfiction and, yes, it's still up - or was, last time I checked. And no, I'm not going to tell you where it was posted or under what name, because it was bad, and I was fifteen when I wrote it. We had a good time writing it, though - and I think part of the reason we (foolishly) thought it was so great was because we poured a lot of our friendship and humor into the fic, to the point that the experience of writing the fic was greater than the sum of the parts.I feel like that's kind of what happened in MY LADY JANE. These three authors, who I imagine are probably friends, decided to sit down together and compose their own fic - only it wasn't Ranma 1/2 or Inuyasha fic that they were writing about, but history itself. They sat down and they wrote fanfiction about Lady Jane Grey, and decided that Jane shouldn't die, so they turned her tragic ending and short-lived rule into a \"spirited\" romance, and they decided that Edward wasn't frail and sickly, but being poisoned instead. And they decided that the war between the Catholics and the Protestants would be much better written as a war between the, well, not-shape-shifters and the shape-shifters. And they also decided that shape-shifter was too banal, so they'd call them \"edians\" with a weird \"d.\" CONFUSED YET? I WAS, TOO.This is Tudor history crackfic, only it doesn't really work for a number of reasons.Number 1) The narrative is condescending AF. The authors have all these constant asides written in parenthesis, which are obviously supposed to come across as adorable and funny and cute, but instead come across as overly precious and hand-holdy. \"DID YOU GET MY JOKE? DID YOU?\" It's literally the narrative equivalent of a four-year-old child thrusting their macaroni art into your face.Number 2) The premise is stupid. When I got to the first page, I was like, \"WTF.\" And then I got five pages deeper, and I was like, \"ARE YOU KIDDING ME?\" And by the time I got to the end of the book I was like, \"HOLY HECK, YOU WEREN'T KIDDING ME.\" MY LADY JANE aspires to be many things - it wants to be Monty Python (and even rips several lines from it, including \"It's just a flesh wound\" and \"your mother was a hamster, and your father smelled of elderberries\"); it wants to be Ladyhawke (or East of the Sun, West of the Moon); it wants to be The Princess Bride; and I think it wants to be Blackadder as well, with all that heavy winking about history, but it fails at all of these because it isn't funny enough to be like Monty Python, it isn't tragic or well-scripted enough to be Ladyhawke, it isn't as romantic or as clever as Princess Bride, and it especially is not as historically astute as Blackadder, which had inside jokes about history down to an art form. This book's jokes about history is to mention anachronisms like Jimi Hendrix or to cheekily suggest that Edward was the inventor of the hover hand (no, I'm not kidding) or that Jane was the inspiration for using \"ferret\" as a verb instead of just a noun (because, you know, she can turn into a ferret). WTF, book?Number 3) The characters have no depth and their personalities and motivations can LITERALLY be summed up in a single word. Observe. Edward: \"Sex.\" Gifford: \"G.\" Jane: \"Books.\" Gracie: \"Scottish.\" Mary: \"Evil.\" ALL of their interactions and jokes are based around these words. Edward wants to have sex before he dies, and then when he meets a girl, obsesses over her single-mindedly. Gifford hates his name and wants to be called \"G.\" Jane likes books in that annoying way that's typical of heroines, in that it compensates for her utter lack of personality, and panders desperately to us, the readers, who also like books (and is tantamount to a giant neon \"PLEASE LIKE HER\" sign). Gracie is a Scottish shape-shifter who acts like Merida, and for some reason her being Scottish is a Big Deal. Mary, who I always kind of felt sorry for, is branded as the villain. Because apparently it's not enough that she's got a drink named \"Bloody Mary\" named after her; she's got to be the cardboard cut-out villain in this book populated with Patricia Wrede rejects. Why not rename her Evil Evilsson?Number 4) The humor is so dumb and lame. For example, Gracie is a fox shifter and Edward thinks she's hot, so the authors make this terrible joke: Yes, Gracie was a fox. No, really. She was. Literally. (We know. It's too good.) (47%). Bad pun, which the authors then feel the need to explain, and then feel the need to congratulate themselves for. The entire narrative is like that, and I found it really grating. Maybe some people will find it charming, but I prefer subtlety to sledgehammers. And here's an example of Jane showing us how much she likes to book her books when she books her booky books:\u00a0 \"Armies aren't very good about carrying libraries with them. I can't imagine why. We'd fight so much less if everyone would just sit down and read\" (79%). In case you didn't get it: BOOKS.I bought this because it was on sale for $1.99 at the time and because most of my friends said that they loved it. They loved it. I don't get it (I REALLY DON'T GET IT OKAY), but whatever, I'm glad they enjoyed it (even if I'm now second-guessing all of their recommendations to me). When I wrote that crazy fic with my friends, we had a few(!) readers who would actually egg us on to write more. They even subscribed via their emails so they could get UPDATES(!!!) when we posted. Young me was shocked that we had so few readers to appreciate our brilliance. Older, wiser me is amazed that we had any at all. I'm sure these authors were really proud of their book, and they had a lot of fun writing it, and probably all patted each other on the back for a job well done. And hey, for every naysayer like me, there's like a thousand people who ate this up like it was an ice cream sundae with the works. SO CLEARLY, something here worked for some people. But if you're going into this thinking it's going to be like Monty Python or The Princess Bride like I did, it's not. At all.P.S. F**K YOU, G.

We\u2019re really sorry for what we\u2019re about to do to your history.\n\nI am completely in love with this book, the characters, the setting and the humor. One of my top 10 favorites reads of all-time and certainly one of my favorites for 2016. IN LOVE!Can I first mention how beautiful this book is? I love the style on the front, the spine is lovely, it has that buttery texture and just to top-it-off, it has deckled pages. Am I the only one that is obsessed with deckled pages?!?!? This was the first book I owned that had them and ever since I've been all about it. The cover is stunning as well. I'm usually not a huge fan of people on covers but this is so pretty and the cover model looks exactly how I would imagine our heroin looking. Perfect! Ok, yes - this might have been a cover buy originally. Glad it ended up being so much more. My Lady Jane is written by three women and I honestly forgot that more than one person had written this book because it flowed perfectly, there was no difference in the styles that I noticed. I am blown away at how they could meld their voices together so seamlessly. I NEED these women write another book together. In my opinion, they are total geniuses. I am madly in love with this book. I had no problem getting through this one and had a major book hangover when it was over. Not because the book was devastating or particularly intense but because I wanted more from these characters. I wasn't ready to say goodbye. The humor in My Lady Janeis on-point, I laughed out-loud more times than I can count. I can't remember the last time I read a book with this much wit and charm. Jane was a wonderful protagonist. She was independent, strong, introverted and, be still my heart, a reader. These qualities might sound cliche but they were anything but in this instance. Jane's betrothed, Gifford (G) was fantastic. I really don't want to go into this very much because I believe that you should go into this one as blind as possible and just enjoy the ride. I can't remember hating any characters - as least not ones I wasn't supposed to hate. They were all well-written and had played their part in the story. As I mentioned, I loved Jane and G; therefore, I shipped them pretty hard. It breaks my heart I can't read more of their story, they just made me smile the whole time. I loved that it wasn't an insta-love kind of YA romance. The authors took their time to develop these characters and the various feelings they had for each other. It was a total treat. I wish this book had more fangirls so I could buy merch. Finally I want some merch and it has to be for a book that barely has any. FigureObviously I recommend this book. It's silly, fun and and smart. I knew within 100 pages that they would really have to mess up for me not to give this one a five star. Bring me more books like this!

YAY \nShe delighted in the smell of the ink, the rough feel of the paper between her fingers, the rustle of sweet pages, the shapes of the letters before her eyes. And most of all, she loved the way that books could transport her from her otherwise mundane and stifling life and offer the experiences of a hundred other lives. Through books she could see the world.\nI was really really excited to read this book because I heard SOOOO many great things about it and I also heard that this book was funny. I often cry while reading but I rarely laugh while reading so when I heard this book was funny, I was really happy because maybe I would find another all time favorite book and LOOK AT THAT COVER! it's so pretty! and I had high expectation before reading it and my expectation was really really high. this was my expression when I started reading this book :this was my expression when I reached around 100 pages and I was like \" it's kind of ... boring\" this was my expression when I reached page 266 and I was like \" okay. I swear I can't do this anymore. I give up. I give up\"now I'm going to tell you why I did not finish it and I'm going to review this book just as far as I read this book, which is 266 pages and I don't even know the ending. I didn't skim it when I read it. The Charactersin my opinion all the characters were flat. I didn't hate the characters, I just felt nothing toward all of them and Edward was ... kind of annoying. the most boring POV in this book was Edward's POV I was really bored when I read his POV. all he was thinking about was kissing this girl. I think her name was Gracie. he mentioned 'Kiss' again, again and again until I felt bored and I didn't think he was supposed to think that. He was supposed to think about Jane and his kingdom instead of thinking to kiss. ugh. he was a king after all. but wait ... I don't think we should take this book too seriously because it was a parody, isn't it? but I didn't feel like this was a parody. this is not funny AT ALL. I this was my expression every time he mentioned 'Kiss'oh and he wanted to kiss this Gracie at the first time he saw her. is this even funny? NO NOT AT ALL Still, there she was, her finger against his lips, making him think of putting his lips on her lips. And when his gaze dropped, from her eyes to her lips, a girlish flush spread over her cheeks. Which made him want to kiss her even more. I don't know whether he still thinks about kissing her or not in the next pages or in the end of the book but he probably kisses her in the end. I don't know and I'm not intrested to find it out. I'm no longer intrested in reading this book but if you have read it, you can tell me on the comment section below and mark it as spoiler, so people who haven't read it won't be spoiled :)and Gifford or G ( he doesn't want being called Gifford and I don't know why. I personally think that name is fine. nothing wrong with it *shrugs* ) I don't know why I couldn't imagine how he looked like! it frustrated me because I always can imagine how people look like while reading but when I read this book I just felt like ... I was reading a book and nothing happened inside my head. I think that happened because I just didn't enjoy or like this book and Jane was fine. I didn't have any problem with her. The Romancethe romance was boring and in my opinion the romance between Jane and G was boring. I didn't feel anything about their relationship and it was such a wonder when she had feeling for G because I didn't love or like G. the romance just happened too fast and on the other hand, the romance between Edward and Gracie happened EXTREMLY TOO FAST. He actually wanted to kiss her the first time he saw her. I totally didn't like the romance. I think it was kind of Insta-Love and Insta-Love is one of my bookish pet peeves. the romance is also one of the reasons I can't continue reading it. The Plotit's predictable. My guess about Edward's sickness was right and I heard this book is funny but IT IS NOT FUNNY. maybe I just smiled once or twice but I don't think I ever laughed while reading it because if I laughed then I would remember it. I think this is the first time I read Historical Fiction book and maybe that genre is not my cup of tea. I don't know what is wrong with me. I just don't find this book funny and I always slept every time I started reading it so I was only able to read just few pages before I found myself sleeping.thank you guys for reading this review and liking it.

The story follows 3 characters : \u25cfEdward Tudor: He's the king of England, child of King Henry VIII, who is also a sixteen years old boy with dry sense of humour who fantasies about kissing a girl but he's quite unlucky because he's dying. His one and only nightmare is dying before even kiss a girl.I mean i totally get him, i will likely get disappointed too. But all what our king is doing at the moment is considering who will inherit his crown.....That's what kings do when they are dying, don't they?Which leads us to *drums* : \u25cfLady Jane Grey  : She's a real historical character, as real as Henry VIII and Edward. She is (in real life) The queen who ruled England for nine days and then had her head chopped off. As our narrators said \"Sometimes history gets it all wrong\" So Jane is Edward's best friend and cousin, whom he has arranged to mary her off to secure the line of succession. (Marry her off to GIFFORD DUDLEY KDBCHZKZJZBD) But Jane is a girl who would rather read books than get married, the woman eats books, breaths books, pet books, protect books (at all costs) and most of all read books.

It is written by three lovely authors: Jodi Meadows, Brodi Ashton, and Cynthia Hand.  To be frank, it feels like one person wrote it. I keep forgetting the fact that three people had written this. I bet you $100 to spot the distinction and claim which author had written what part because\u2026.there is literally no difference in the writing style.

The authors decided to add a \nfantasy twist. \nYou see, these individuals are called E\u00f0ian. They have the ability to switch between two different forms: human and animal.  They are pretty much shape-shifters. In this fictional world, E\u00f0ians are hated and looked down upon. Gifford (he prefers to go by G) is one of the main MC\u2019s and well\u2026..he\u2019s a horse. He is the Duke\u2019s son and ends up in an arranged marriage with Jane, another of our main MC\u2019s. Jane, is literally ME. All she wants to do is  just read and read and read and YOU GUESSED IT?? REAAAAAD.  Also, I'm pretty sure everyone will no doubt connect with Jane because reading is her passion (Cough Cough, what a surprise, so is mine!)  and her ability to never stop promoting everyone to read is entertaining. For example: \n\u201cArmies aren't very good about carrying libraries with them. I can't imagine why. We'd fight so much less if everyone would just sit down and read\u201d \nIn other words: Choose the book life. Then, we have Edward VI, the king and our last main MC. He suffers from this dreadful disease which is killing him. Like the poor guy never reached first base with anyone. He\u2019s never been able to go out and do things a normal teenage boy would do. Also, he's Jane's cousin.Anyway.I loved Jane and G. They are OTP. I shipped them a little bit too hard but who can blame me??? They are just so cute *squeals*Now guys, the reason why I loved them so much is because of the banter between Jane and G or more like her horse jokes. Obviously, I have to share it. How else am I suppose to convince you to read this???  \u201cNo horse jokes,\" he said.\"My lord, I apologize for the horse joke. If you put down the book---unharmed!---I will give you a carrot.\"He brandished the book at her. \"Was that a horse joke?\"\"Neigh.\"\"Was that a horse joke?\u201dOR\u201cVery funny, my lady. And that reminds me\"---he pointed a finger at her---\"no horse jokes.\"He was making it too easy. \"Ah, my lord, why the long face?\"\"That's it!\u201d OKAY, ONE MORE!!\u201cI\u2019m so hungry I could eat a horse. Oh. Sorry, G. Not you, of course.\u201d  *knee slap* If you didn\u2019t laugh, chuckled or at least smiled then buddy what\u2019s wrong with your sense of humor?? C\u2019mon, it was hilarious. Admit it. There's no shame. Alright.Although, there\u2019s a lot of things going on and I want to address them BUT I don\u2019t want to spoil it. This is all I\u2019m going to leave you off with. Also, I advise you to not open this book in a public place. You will have a difficult time containing your laughter. Trust me, I embarrassed the crap out of myself countless times in the subway. \nI recommend this book to anyone who just needs a good laugh and a funny cheesy plot to read. If this is something you'd dig then this book is practically calling you. Pick it up!! \nYou can find this review and my other reviews at Booksprens"}], "description": "Edward (long live the king) is the King of England. He\u2019s also dying, which is inconvenient, as he\u2019s only sixteen and he\u2019d much rather be planning for his first kiss than considering who will inherit his crown\u2026Jane (reads too many books) is Edward\u2019s cousin, and far more interested in books than romance. Unfortunately for Jane, Edward has arranged to marry her off to secure the line of succession. And there\u2019s something a little odd about her intended\u2026Gifford (call him G) is a horse. That is, he\u2019s an E\u00f0ian (eth-y-un, for the uninitiated). Every day at dawn he becomes a noble chestnut steed\u2014but then he wakes at dusk with a mouthful of hay. It\u2019s all very undignified.The plot thickens as Edward, Jane, and G are drawn into a dangerous conspiracy. With the fate of the kingdom at stake, our heroes will have to engage in some conspiring of their own. But can they pull off their plan before it\u2019s off with their heads?", "title": "My Lady Jane\n      \n          (The Lady Janies #1)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22840421.My_Lady_Jane__The_Lady_Janies___1_", "average": 4.12, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1444923765l/22840421.jpg", "reviews": 5896, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3290920.Cynthia_Hand", "name": "Cynthia Hand"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4384465.Brodi_Ashton", "name": "Brodi Ashton"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4116488.Jodi_Meadows", "name": "Jodi Meadows"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fantasy", "Young Adult", "Romance", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22840421-my-lady-jane", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26795352-my-lady-jane", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27212433-my-lady-jane", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30647644-my-lady-jane", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7488244-unearthly", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11563110-hallowed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13049981-boundless", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17285330-the-last-time-we-say-goodbye", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15851966-radiant", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19755140-embassytown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32858845-off-to-be-the-wizard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10931746-the-stepford-wives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13604418-the-long-earth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34111309-the-man-of-legends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193375-fellside", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204943-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18806963-prayers-to-broken-stones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18126623-2061", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29425329-alas-babylon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193696-3001", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18162904-dreams-and-shadows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35106805-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25353286-provenance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23249416-an-unwelcome-quest"]}
