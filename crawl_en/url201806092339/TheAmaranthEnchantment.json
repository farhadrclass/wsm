Confusing, unsatisfying plot, I never sympathized with the protagonist, never saw why she liked the love interest. Obviously, anything with folkloric themes is going to be formulaic, but this managed to be formulaic without having any sort of clever addition. It was a quick read, and maybe a teen who devours anything with a fairy tale plot will enjoy it."}, {"userName": "Cara", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1876075-cara", "userReview": "Don't you love it when the book has a pretty cover? It makes the whole experience of reading that much better.  Really . You know when you finish and look at the book longingly it makes you think \" yeah the story deserved such a wonderful cover \". Ok now on to the story and to stop rambling about pretty pictures....I am a sucker for fairy tale retellings so I went expecting to like it and that I did. This book uses some of the traditional Cinderella signatures. She is born of a wealthy family, later orphaned, meets a prince, has something like a fairy godmother, but Berry makes the whole tale spin into something incredibly original. Lucinda, our main character, is the one who holds the whole story together. She is feisty, vulnerable, loyal, stronger than she thinks, and funny in that way back when way.The plot is fairly original like I mentioned. There are some twists but nothing way too shocking. The godmother of the story is a character you won't forget. I hope we see some kind of sequel to this book to see more of what happens to her and that retched stone. Beautiful but very troublesome. Peter the street thief is great. He is a little conceited I guess but I loved the way things ended up for him. Gregor is a dreamboat even if we don't get to see him that much. I did have some qualms about the ending though. It isn't as neat as I would have hoped. Like when nobody really seems to care or notice what happened to the villain? What's up with that? Also we aren't sure if Lucinda tells Gregor how the big showdown happened. One thing I really did give kudo points to Lucinda for is that her whole happiness didn't cling on to the prince, but at the same time you knew she really cared and loved him. Not easy to do but the author did it.I can't believe I almost forgot to mention Dog the goat. He's the real hero of the story:) You'll see when you read it."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/131002-julie", "userReview": "I do love this book ... but then again, I wrote it. :) Advance readers, I would love to hear your thoughts!"}, {"userName": "Ginger", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/133022-ginger", "userReview": "The Amaranth Enchantment, Julie Berry's debut novel, has the shadow of a fairy tale in its soul. Yes, there's a prince, but not just any prince; this prince looks like he swallowed the sun for breakfast. Yes, there's a royal ball, but not just any royal ball; this ball is to announce the engagement of the prince to a princess who looks like she was sculpted from spun sugar. And then there's our heroine, Lucinda Chapdelaine, who has not only wit, but compassion as well, not to mention brains and beauty, too. Add to this mix a rogue of a street thief, a faithful goat named Dog, a bit of magic, a maligned woman, and an immortal villain and you get a delightful and well-written read.

If Ms. Berry had added more detail, and more description this book could have been wonderful, but there were not enough words to put a picture into my head. The end was very rushed.SPOILERS:I stewed on this book all night and have questions. 1. Have these people never heard of rope, handcuffs, or cages? Why does someone have to sacrifice themselves? 2. How the heck in the city that the prince went missing in, remembering the birth mark and that his mother knew it right off, does a street thief (whom you would expect to have knowledge of goings on) not know that the boy wondering outside could possibly be the prince? 3. Why would Beryl not go back to help Lucinda? She knows how easy it is to get back home now, and she knows that someone wants her stone badly, so she sends it back! Without anyone to protect Lucinda? Hello? 4. If the family could come and help Lucinda, why could they not get back the people that sacrificed themselves? (Barring question 1). 5. What the heck happened to Aunt? Did they make up? What? 6. What was with the gathering of a goat? Did someone not miss it? 7. Where was the person that originally sacrificed themselves for Coxley? 8.

She is treated like a servant in their house and in their goldsmith shop. One day, everything changes when the mysterious woman known as the Amaranth Witch brings a spectacular gem into their shop to be set. The same day, Lucinda meets Prince Gregor, who is in search of a bauble to give his betrothed, whom he has never even met. Combine the magical world of the Amaranth Witch, the handsome and gallant Prince Gregor, a lovable street rat named Peter, and an endearingly loyal goat who thinks he's a dog, and you get one fantastic story!I loved all of the characters in this book, and the way they were all so cleverly intertwined in each other's lives. Lucinda was a strong-willed heroine who had been through a lot, but she still had a soft and tender heart underneath it all. She wasn't so strong and hardened that she couldn't cry or be vulnerable with her emotions.Lucinda's romance (almost a love triangle, actually) was just exactly what I love to read. Gregor and Lucinda's special night at the Winter Festival is exactly what every young girl dreams of. Gregor's small gestures of affection were heart stopping and really stood out as very romantic.Peter was a lovable rascal and he was just like a cute puppy who you could never really be angry with no matter how many times he messes up. And Dog, the goat, practically steals the entire show-what a hero!The only complaint I could possibly have about this book is that it could have been longer and the characters and situations even more fleshed out. There was so much to love, all of the scenes could have been even more in depth. However, the simplicity and innocence of the book was one of its charms.I loved this book and will definitely put it on my keeper shelf! The characters really put this story over the top!reviewed for http://inthehammockblog.blogspot.com/"}, {"userName": "Lara", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/309689-lara", "userReview": "Part Cinderella story, part sci-fi story; it's an odd mix, and I'm not entirely sure it works all that well. The other world was an interesting twist, but bothered me in that both the world itself and the rules for coming and going from it seemed ill-defined, and ended up not really making much sense to me. It also bothered me that the relationships between various characters seemed to become too deep within too short a time period. I have a hard time with books where people fall in love at first sight, or on first meeting or whatever, with no real significant interaction between them. That happened in this book, as well as people becoming \"the deepest of friends\" almost immediately. I wish the action had just been stretched out to cover more time. And then there's the goat. This goat (named Dog, of all things) that just suddenly starts following the main character around and is super smart and super protective of her and manages to find her wherever she is, no matter where she leaves him. I'm not really sure what the point of it was, other than for the goat to miraculously help the heroine out of various sticky situations. I found it quite irritating. That said, I really liked a couple of the characters, and I got sucked into the story pretty quickly. The writing was good for the most part; I just wish that maybe Berry had put a little more into it."}, {"userName": "Dottie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1560297-dottie", "userReview": "This is the first novel by Julie Berry and it is a lovely fairy tale - aimed at ages 10-14 but I really enjoyed it.

But blurbs are deceptive. I find it really hard and disappointing to rate a historical--and fantastical!--book 2.5, but if I should be honest with myself, the book was a major let-down. I was ready to give the book 5 stars at the beginning. I mean, why not? It was nice and funny. I LOVED Peter and Lucinda's first scene together. However, as the story progressed, everything went downhill. I gave it 2.5 stars because I liked the plot and the characters; I also gave of character development, my confusion, the lack of rationality, and the truloveforever! (And majorly because she doesn't end up with a certain someone. In fact, none of the main characters, in most of the books I read, end up with someone else.). I liked Lucinda, and LOVED Peter's character. Gregor, to me, wasn't the potential guy. He was more of a flirtatious playboy than a potential love interest. Beryl and Lucinda's friendship wouldn't be what I'd call close. Hell, they barely knew each other, and Beryl sent Lucinda literally to her grave (well, she would've, if it weren't for a certain interference). All I'm saying is that the book is too short, despite its 306 pages (the font is a little bigger than most books). The author could've extended the story to properly develop her characters, and to show proper passage of time, and work EXTRA hard on the romance. Meeting someone a couple of times is NOT enough to make you fall in love, especially if the people hadn't spoken properly. Jesus. P.S., what was with all those mortifying scenes? I had to bury my head under my pillow to shake off the embarrassment I felt for Lucinda. I don't like such scenes, but it is no contributor to the rating. All in all, the book is great, but there are a lot of things lacking. I say read it, but you're up for some serious disappointment."}, {"userName": "Mindi", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5000907-mindi", "userReview": "Despite the two star rating, this book really was enjoyable. However, it was a very generic fantasy/fairy tale novel. One thing that really frustrated me was that the setting was so ambiguous that certain things seemed out of place. Details pointed me towards the Victorian Era (the use of the words hats, the emphasis on Christmas), but others suggested another era. The last names suggested France, but the first names were decidedly English. Berry was clearly going for her own made up place, but she referenced real places (Gibraltar), so it felt very muddled and it bothered me.Our hero, Lucinda, is pretty generic, too: spirited and beautiful (but she doesn't recognize that, of course). She even has a goat sidekick--I don't have enough fingers and toes to count how many times that has been done. It also bothered me that she falls in love with her love interest upon their first meeting. Um, hello, Lucinda. He could be a jerk, for all you know.Lucinda's also very bipolar when it comes to other characters.

There were several holes in the plot (like why didn't she just tell the prince the truth from the beginning?) but I could forgive that if the heroine was worth it. She's not. She starts off as a poor picked on Cinderella type but then the author tries to make her bolder, but it doesn't work. I never had much liking for her. Not to mention that there's no reason for her to love who she does, other than he's handsome. The author develops the main character's relationship with her pet goat more than that of the leading man. Not to mention I didn't really enjoy the whole sci-fi/fantasy combination.

Also, I wanted to like the possible love interests in her life, but they never felt accurately developed. One seemed undeveloped, so I kept waiting for him to turn out to be evil (won't say if he does or not), instead of enjoying Lucinda's relationship with him. And the other seemed overly developed for where the resolution of that relationship.I liked the mystery of the stone, of the mysterious woman Beryl, and the world from whence she came. The magical part of this story was very captivating and I enjoyed the friendship that grew between Beryl and Lucinda.Be warned though, that there are some fairly grim and dark scenes in the book. With attempted murders (and killings that happened in the past), the grimness of these crimes felt a bit heavy given the rest of the book. I love a good fairytale! I love the sweet stories of Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty. But what's often criticized is the love interest - the love at first sight aspect -- which, I'm usually fine to overlook if the rest of the story is similarly \"fairytale-ish.\" But this book felt \"fairytale-ish\" in the aspect of love, and dark and \"realistic\" in almost everything else, and I think that's why I left with a less than satisfied feeling.I really did like a lot of the foundations to this story, and the writing was smooth.

Since then, she has had no taste of her old fancy life, forced instead to work for her cruel aunt at a jewelry store. Then, as if by fate, a mysterious woman and her equally mysterious jewel enter the shop, and Lucinda\u2019s life is irrevocably changed. This chance meeting and others acquaint Lucinda with a varied cast of characters including the Amaranth Witch, a street thief named Peter, and even the royal prince, who land her in a set of wild situations. And along the way, Lucinda will make a few friends, escape evil clutches, learn about herself, and even discover the truth about her parents\u2019 death.The Amaranth Enchantment is truly a delightful and amusing read. Lucinda is so easy to relate to and sympathize with, especially because of the miserable situations she often finds herself in, and her quick thinking and wit make her a joy to read about. And the other characters, especially Peter the thief, provide much amusement as well. There are several exciting elements of fantasy, especially in the form of the Amaranth Witch, that will no doubt thrill readers. My only disappointment was that the Amaranth Witch\u2019s world was not fully delved into and explored, which I would\u2019ve appreciated. I also found it a little off when Lucinda declared her love for the prince after nearly just meeting him. But I did love how Lucinda\u2019s little adventures took her everywhere from jail cells to the royal court. This novel is definitely a satisfying and entertaining tale.Fans of Catherine Murdock\u2019s Princess Ben will also enjoy Berry\u2019s debut novel, even thought the Amaranth Enchantment isn\u2019t as good as the spectacular Princess Ben.

Convenient as it is to have a quick read to hand, I do feel like this book would have benefited a lot from increased length and detail.The ending is... well, personally, I find 'everything falls perfectly into place' finales enjoyable much of the time, especially in a fairytale framework, but if that's not your jam you'll probably be unsatisfied by this. So: be warned."}, {"userName": "Kathi", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1107663-kathi", "userReview": "Here's a barn burner of a first book! Julie Berry gives us a gripping young heroine, feisty and hearty too. The narrative moves quickly, there's a beloved and lovable character named Dog, who though a four-footer is not a dog. There's a scoundrel. A prince. An enchantress. An ogre of an aunt. A thoroughly surprising and satisfying ending. Though I read it in a single go, I think this one deserves to be read out loud. Find a kiddo, make some hot chocolate, and sink into a wonderful story. Julie Berry has done herself proud in this debut outing. Enjoy!"}, {"userName": "Giselle Bradley", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1342871-giselle-bradley", "userReview": "DNF'd. I only got about 10 pages in before wanting to rip out all my hair. The main character was petty and a victim. She thinks about how easy it would be to get out of her situation and how she wants to but then doesn't do anything!! She's an idiot and I was so disappointed. I've been wanting to read this book for 7+ years and it was such a let down."}], "description": "When Lucinda Chapdelaine was a small child, her parents left for the royal ball and never returned.
