He\u2019d learned early on in his work that the real writers hadn\u2019t gone to Yale or Oxford; they came from everywhere - or nowhere \u2013 and their determination to dig down, to matter, whatever the odds against them, was the only key to their succeeding\u201dMuse is the first novel by American poet, translator and publisher of iconic Farrar, Straus and Giroux, Jonathan Galassi. The only literature-appreciating member of his decidedly non-literary family, a teen-aged Paul Dukach takes refuge in Pages, the local bookstore. When proprietress, Morgan Dickerman introduces him to the poetry of Ida Perkins, it is the beginning of a life-long passion. He devours her work and becomes a fanatical expert on all there is to know about this elusive woman who was\u201d\u2026 literally enamored with art \u2013 arguably less so with the individuals who created it, who often turned out to have inconvenient needs and egos of their own, which on occasion dwarfed even hers\u201dOn graduation from college, Paul eventually finds employment with independent publisher, Purcell and Stern, learning a great deal from his boss, the brash but knowledgeable Homer Stern: \u201cSexual activity for Homer was an index of moral fallibility and vitality at one and the same time. It didn\u2019t matter what people did; he was sure they did something illicit. It meant they were alive, like him. Maybe he was simply looking for companionship in transgression\u201d. Paul also gets to know Stern\u2019s arch-rival, Sterling Wainwright, Ida\u2019s second cousin and publisher of all her works. On the way home from a European book fair (\u201cFrankfurt [Book Fair] was anything but social; it was carnivorousness at its most rapacious, with a genteel European veneer. The dressy clothes, the parties, the cigars, the jacked-up prices in the hotels and restaurants, the disappointing food were all of a piece. It was exhausting and repetitive and depressing \u2013 and no one in publishing with any sense or style would have missed it for the world\u201d), Paul finally gets the opportunity to meet his idol, now reclusive for many years in Venice. He finds that Venice \u201c\u2026 wasn\u2019t dead at all. Venice was a Platonic beehive buzzing with covert vitality. Its fabulous gilt-encrusted past wasn\u2019t the point; it was how the past kept gnawing away at the present, digesting and fermenting and reforming it, and extruding it into the future\u201d. And for some reason, Ida takes him into her confidence, entrusting him with an explosive secret. \u201cIda had surely been no saint\u2026Ida had been guileless and wilful, passionate and snobbish, generous, great-hearted, self-seeking, myopic, petty\u201d This he knew, but now he faces a dilemma. Galassi\u2019s extensive experience in both the publishing industry and as a poet are apparent on every page. He peoples his novel with a cast of highly believable authors, editors and publishers that, no doubt, bear more than a passing resemblance to figures in the actual literary industry. Of his publishers, he says: \u201cTheir authors and their work had been the ultimate raison d\u2019etre for whatever they themselves had done. Beyond their petty self-aggrandizing, Homer and Sterling and their kind had been true to their writers\u2019 gifts. \u2026Their authors were their gods\u2026\u201d. He completes the effect with a bibliography of Ida\u2019s works and books about her. This is quite a debut novel, one that will have a broad appeal, but in particular to those involved in the industry.

It is true, it is boring. But while remaining an incontrovertible defect, this is surely one of its lesser offenses to good aesthetic judgment. Firstly, it is strange that an editor writes a book that is filled so uniformly with clich\u00e9d idioms. Opened to any page at random, MUSE yields up its bromides. Ladies men are 'handsome and charming', WASPs are 'card-carrying', a work experience is 'peaches and cream', poems are 'hypnotically lyrical,' and most tiresomely, love, as it is insisted, is not 'productive'. (The review at the New Republic has a bunch more; there are, unfortunately, plenty for everyone.) The tone of the book is constantly gushing yet conventional, florid yet buzzy and platitudinous. As I read it, knowing of this man's authority in our world of books, it reminded me of the queasy feeling you get as a kid when your high-school music teacher 'goes wild' on the saxophone at a school assembly, tootling and trilling his heart out, squandering his ethos and authority in a way that cannot be undone.That the book is written in such poor language (by an oft-published poet, no less!) is nothing, though, compared to the larger bill of goods for sale here. Galassi wants you to imagine that this world he insists on calling 'glamorous', will take on a glamorous identity merely by his constant reiteration of the invocation. It is as though the author believed that accumulation of allusions could hide the essential emptiness, the lack of imaginative coherency, in what he describes. I began to have the suspicion that the publishing world in its modern incarnation has disappointed Jonathan Galassi, and so he hopes, by cobbling together such a novel, to call back, as at a s\u00e9ance, the ghost of the alluring. And yet the poverty of his means of doing so, which has to do with the essential conventionality of his system of values, the fetishistic overvaluation of literary genius which results, paradoxically, in its devaluation, his apparently inexhaustible vulnerability to cults of personality, and his cowardly, rather clubby recycling of themes long threadbare, all make this reader feel that perhaps the downfall of the 'good old days' of publishing that Galassi so keenly, so nostalgically decries, was in part a development brought on by the lurking unoriginality of Jonathan Galassi himself. This book has troubled me for a few days now. As many readers have pointed out, much of the book is taken up with kitchen-sink reminiscences of \u2018dazzling figures\u2019 old wealthy, good old boys and gals, all \u2018legendary\u2019 for their \u2018eccentricity\u2019. And yet when this lop-sided construction, in which the action doesn\u2019t start until the book is two-thirds done and then abruptly reaches a premature climax, only to limp on and on, into meandering afterward-style chattering-on, all these figures have made no impression at all, their \u2018eccentricities\u2019 have been forgettable, their life stories clumsily conventional and soporifically journalistic. Throughout this work, Galassi mistakes celebrity for character, nostalgia for beauty, and most fatally, sensation for action. And I asked myself: How can it be that Galassi--president of the stalwart FSG, one-time poetry editor at the Paris Review--offers as his tribute to the values of real literature a lazy, fogged out, unconsidered work? How can a person in his position not care more? Having meditated for some time, the only theory I have come up with to explain it is the possibility that Galassi has locked himself inside a contradiction. It is possible, given his position, that he accepts or has been forced to accept the most fundamental axioms of the literary marketplace he inhabits, a world that, while not entirely gone to pot, is uncoupled from the forces which allow or even require the natural daily exercise of the muscle of rigorous aesthetic judgment. From things explicitly stated in his text, it is clear Galassi knows this truth as well as I, and probably far better. And yet, apparently fundamentally conservative and peaceable, he accepts these terms, these axioms, all the same. The French philosopher Alain Badiou suggests that there is a link between holding a self-contradictory position, and melancholy. A person who \"accepts the fundamental axioms of [their] society while bitterly complaining about the consequences of those same axioms [...] will become more and more melancholy.\" Perhaps it is Galassi's frustrated relationship with the _living_ values of great literature that makes him retreat to a clumsy, highly melancholy celebration of books, via the cult of confabulated fame and humbug personality. Certainly, this reader never believed in Ida Perkins. But he does believe in something else -- something better."}, {"userName": "Dee", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37666813-dee", "userReview": "\"This is a love story. It's about the good old days, when men were men and women were women and books were books, with glued or even sewn bindings, cloth or paper covers with beautiful or not-so-beautiful jackets and a musty, dusty, wonderful smell; when books furnished many a room, and their contents, the magic words, their poetry and prose, were liquor, perfume, sex, and glory to their devotees. These loyal readers were never many but they were always engaged, always audible and visible, alive to the romance of reading. Perhaps they still exist underground somewhere, hidden fanatics of the cult of the printed word.\"This is an insider's descriptive tale and a drama of the publishing industry where two houses compete for one iconic poet, told in rich, lyrical prose with a colorful cast of New York eccentrics, homosexuals and Communists. Another reviewer lamented the book's lack of simple sentences, but that's what I enjoyed most about this quick and engrossing read. The writing weaves layers of allusions, details and anecdotes together to create a realistic, crystal-sharp world full of love affairs, lives, the passage of time and the tragedies that all revolve around books. A solid debut novel of passion-driven intellectuals and self-made men that's entertaining enough to read on the beach and intelligent enough to keep on the bookshelf.

Muse turns the peculiar world of publishing inside-out, and presents a broad, hilarious, and unbelievably believable cast of characters for the reader's examination. This is the best part of the book; Galassi's portrait of the literati is at once poignant, irreverent, and scathingly funny. If you've ever wondered what the book business looks like from the inside, this is a great place to start. However, if you don't have an abiding interest in the publishing industry, you might not find it quite so enthralling. Galassi's characters leap off the page, but anyone looking for a strong narrative thread to follow may be frustrated. There's definitely a plot, but what actually happens is much less interesting than the people it happens to. The ending feels a little too tidy for such a messy group of people, and even though nearly everyone is dead by the time you turn the last page, there's no real sense of closure. Still, that didn't keep me from enjoying this book immensely.

What I did not expect is how charming and delightful a novel it is. Muse is a love letter to the halcyon days of an industry where publishers were larger-than-life, and often more notorious than the authors they represented.I always read reviews prior to embarking on a new book, mainly to get a feel of what people in general think (as opposed to prejudging an author or forming advance opinions.) In this case, a lot of reviewers bemoaned the fact that their enjoyment of Muse was affectively hobbled by Jonathan Galassi\u2019s insider knowledge.Yes, there is a whole level of allusion here that definitely escaped me. A cursory glance at Galassi\u2019s biography reveals that he heads up Farrar, Straus and Giroux, which he joined in 1985 after being fired from Random House, for reasons I cannot discern.If this had been another kind of book, Galassi would have loaded it to the teeth with broadside salvos aimed at the mercenary industry that had rejected him at one stage. Instead, the book opens with the following declaration: \u201cThis is a love story. It\u2019s about the good old days, when men were men and women were women and books were books.\u201dOf course, this means real books, not e-books, which come in for some of the funniest ribbing towards the end, when Paul has a brief relationship with Rufus from Medusa, a clear reference to Amazon: \u201cContent was king at Medusa, they claimed, but Rufus\u2019s expertise ran more to genre novelists and management gurus than literary writers.\u201dWhile Galassi highlights the intrinsic appeal of this shiny new world, he also laments its inadequacies:Paul was enchanted by the lingo of Rufus\u2019s world: big data, scalability, pivoting, crowdsourcing, virtual convergence, geo-location, but before too long he came to understand that everything his guy was talking about \u2013 platforms and delivery systems and mini-books and nanotech and page rates and and and \u2013 had very little to do with what mattered to Paul, which was the words themselves and the men and women who\u2019d written.And, one might add, the men and women who champion them. This is not to suggest that Galassi paints a rosy-hued portrait of publishing: \u201cThe Impetus offices, in a venerable Meatpacking District building not far from Sterling\u2019s apartment, were at least as scruffy as P&S\u2019s, with upholstery that looked lice-infested and filthy walls that had not been washed, let along painted, in forty years.\u201dProviding a link between the two rival publishers of Impetus and P&S is the character of Paul, who idolises the work of a particular poet published by his boss\u2019s nemesis. The plot kicks into high gear when he has a meeting with his literary idol, a meeting that not only changes a life-time\u2019s worth of fanciful conjecture about her, but which also sees him bestowed with an explosive secret, like a ticking time bomb, set to destroy his world and its dinosaurs.There are fantastic set pieces, such as a warts-and-all depiction of the Frankfurt Book Fair, while Galassi\u2019s descriptions of Venice are achingly beautiful. I also loved the way he addresses such issues as attracting the \u2018right\u2019 readers and dealing with the \u2018cult of personality\u2019.As much as Muse is a lament for this bygone era, it is equally a celebration of writers, publishers and readers, indeed the entire madcap magic circle that begins and ends every time a single book is opened and closed."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4345409-kim", "userReview": "I received a copy of this book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.This novel seemed to me to be almost two books \u2013 the first 65%, which didn\u2019t work for me in the slightest bit, and the last 35%, which worked incredibly well.For the first 65%, I felt as if I was Nick Carraway in \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d. I was given access to a world populated by those with money and means. A literary world, full of allusions which I didn\u2019t understand. I felt like a complete outsider to this world. I expected to get used to it the longer I visited, but instead I just got more and more frustrated. This part seemed to be filled with blustery run on sentences, filled with appositives and superlatives that never ended. I actually tried to find a simple sentence and didn\u2019t.I admit I checked other reviews to see if this was just me or if others felt the same, and I understand that I am in the minority. I have heard others rave about this book, saying that it\u2019s a glimpse into the publishing world. I agree that seemed to be the gist. But it seemed to me that Paul was so wrapped up in being literary and being important that there wasn\u2019t enough attention paid to Paul being an individual. In fact, one other reviewer said that you have to basically be patient and wait for the book to improve. Which it does, in spades.Once Paul actually got to meet the reclusive Ida Perkins, the entire book starts to make sense. I understood his motivation, and I could use parts from the first part of the book to understand his actions. This part of the book flew by, as I was just as interested in Paul\u2019s quest for information and details as he was. Although I\u2019m not a poetry person by any means, I loved Ida\u2019s final manuscript. I thought the poems were brilliant and I\u2019m considering searching out other volumes of poetry for later reading. Unfortunately, I cannot say that I enjoyed enough of the book to recommend it.

The book improves near the end, but not enough to redeem it. I believe a good book should reel the reader in quickly and never let go.I mostly read literature. I'm a poet. I have a lot of experience in the powerless side of the publishing world, so a book called Muse about literary publishing called my name. Still I absolutely hated the first 80 or so pages for the same reasons I don't watch Mad Men. My mother struggled to crawl up the ladder in the Good Old Boy working world. Then I faced similar problems in college, in getting credit, and in the workplace. Spending more time in that flood of testosterone is something I try to avoid. Creating a female poet to be the most popular, money-making author of all time didn't balance out the sexism. It was simply too farcical to swallow. Aside from the unpleasant characters, the book doesn't flow well either. The first 80 pages, in particular, are laden with too many introductions to people we don't need to know and tons of name dropping (ineffective when so many names are fictional). It\u2019s gutsy to create a great poet and include your own writing to support her success. I didn\u2019t buy Ida Perkins\u2019 greatness.The only reason I finished Muse was that I could see myself a bit in Paul, the young author-worshipping English major who takes a low-paying job to near the authors and writing he loves."}, {"userName": "Rebecca Wilkins", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8764476-rebecca-wilkins", "userReview": "This book got better the further into it but it was confusing. There were so many names and I never knew if they were real people, fictional people or fake names given to real people. I couldn't keep track of the time-line either. There is a little story here but more toward the end. I kept wondering if Ida Perkins was a real poet and then see in the back where it lists a bibliography that books written about her were done in 2020! This is 2016 so she must be fictional. I also couldn't believe other than Maya Angeleau that any poet was popular or well known in the USA but it could just be me, not interested in poetry. My paperback has a sexy lady from the 60's on the cover, ala Mad Men looking. I see the Goodreads photo of the cover is just a misty red cover. If the cover photo was of Ida Perkins, it was funny because in the book she is 83 years old and dying. The little bit that you might learn about the publishing industry is so outdated that it isn't really worth your effort for the little bit of story here. This guy should stick to publishing."}], "description": "A first novel, at once hilarious and tender, about the decades-long rivalry between two publishing lions, and the iconic, alluring writer who has obsessed them both.From the publisher of Farrar, Straus and Giroux: a first novel, at once hilarious and tender, about the decades-long rivalry between two publishing lions, and the iconic, alluring writer who has obsessed them both.Paul Dukach is heir apparent at Purcell & Stern, one of the last independent publishing houses in New York, whose shabby offices on Union Square belie the treasures on its list. Working with his boss, the flamboyant Homer Stern, Paul learns the ins and outs of the book trade\u2014how to work an agent over lunch; how to swim with the literary sharks at the Frankfurt Book Fair; and, most important, how to nurse the fragile egos of the dazzling, volatile authors he adores. But Paul's deepest admiration has always been reserved for one writer: poet Ida Perkins, whose audacious verse and notorious private life have shaped America's contemporary literary landscape, and whose longtime publisher\u2014also her cousin and erstwhile lover\u2014happens to be Homer's biggest rival. And when Paul at last has the chance to meet Ida at her Venetian palazzo, she entrusts him with her greatest secret\u2014one that will change all of their lives forever. Studded with juicy details only a quintessential insider could know, written with both satiric verve and openhearted nostalgia, Muse is a brilliant, haunting book about the beguiling interplay between life and art, and the eternal romance of literature.", "title": "Muse", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23164919-muse", "average": 2.8, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1412793867l/23164919.jpg", "reviews": 100, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/434547.Jonathan_Galassi", "name": "Jonathan Galassi"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Literary Fiction", "Writing", "Novels", "Literature"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23164919-muse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25350104-muse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31288017-musa", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31863591-muse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23165061-muse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25707398-la-musa", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23346364-muse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13069046-left-handed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1199877.North_Street_And_Other_Poems", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1199876.Morning_Run", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26030015-north-street", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3195774-the-random-review-1982", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31160055-the-last-cherry-blossom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26583370-life-and-other-near-death-experiences", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20552595-how-i-became-a-famous-novelist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
