It\u2019s a sad tale of prejudice, war, and brutality, as well as of love. Chan Sam had a wife and land in southern China in the 1920s, but word was that one could make enough money at \u2018Gold Mountain\u2019- Canada or the USA- for a person to set themselves up for life. So Chan Sam went to Canada to make his fortune. He didn\u2019t like being alone- there were very, very few women in the Chinatowns at the time. He acquired a concubine from China: a 17 year old May-ying, who was basically sold. Chan didn\u2019t have the money to pay for her, so he made a deal with a tea house owner: the girl would be Chan\u2019s concubine, but during the days and evenings she would work at the tea house to pay off her own purchase price. That\u2019s not an auspicious start for a relationship. As time went on, May-ying had two baby girls. Chan wanted them educated in China, and between the two of them they had made enough money to go home for a while. When Chan Sam and May-ying returned to Canada, her daughters remained in China with Chan\u2019s wife. They returned just in time for May-ying\u2019s third child to be born on Canadian soil. It wasn\u2019t the hoped for son that would have given her some prestige in the family, but another daughter- worthless in her eyes. In time, Chan Sam returned to China without May-ying to try and sire a son on his wife. This left the young May-ying in the unenviable position of financially supporting not just herself and her daughter, but Chan Sam, his wife in China, and her two daughters over there. Not to mention the costs of the mansion (by rural Chinese village standards) that Chan Sam was building in his village. That\u2019s a lot to expect of a young woman. Even after Chan Sam returned to Canada, but had separated from May-ying, he showed up every week to collect the money she had earned. Not that he was lazy; he did back breaking work in the shingle mills and at any other job he could find. Employment was severely limited for the Chinese in North America. May-ying was a badly damaged person. She sought solace in alcohol and gambling, and abused her daughter both physically and emotionally. I was horrified by the way she treated her, but the circumstances of May-ying\u2019s life might have broken anyone. Thankfully, the daughter, who took the English name Winnie, had the inner reserves to survive, concentrating on school and getting away from home. She succeeded in doing so, through hard work and marriage, and brought up a great family. The author is Winnie\u2019s second daughter. After 50 years, the Canadian sister and the Chinese sister finally managed to meet in a 4 day visit that brought tears to my eyes. But what really hit an emotional chord was the way the Chinese family viewed May-ying: basically ignoring the money she\u2019d sent for years, they saw her only as a very bad wife who brought only misery to Chan Sam. They were only given half the story. It\u2019s a very sad story of the miserable lives the Chinese in North America lived during the first half of the 20th century thanks to prejudice, and an even sadder one that as bad as those lives were, they were considered worth while because monetarily it was even worse in China. I\u2019ve read a number of books about the Chinese in North America, and this one is the grimmest. But it\u2019s a story I couldn\u2019t put down and stayed up half the night reading."}, {"userName": "Florence (Lefty) MacIntosh", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10856439-florence-lefty-macintosh", "userReview": "fabulous"}, {"userName": "LibraryCin", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12860715-librarycin", "userReview": "This is a biography of three generations of a Chinese-Canadian family.

May-ying gave Chan Sam 3 daughters; before the 3rd one (Hing) came along, the other two had been taken back to China to live with Chan Sam\u2019s Chinese wife. Hing, the daughter who stayed in Canada, was mostly neglected by her drinking, gambling mother. Hing\u2019s daughter, Denise, is the author of the book. The book does focus mostly on May-ying, but it also tells the story of the family in China, as well. I can\u2019t recall the phrase in the book, but something along the lines of a split family. I thought this was very good. It covers a good portion of the 20th century, so it also includes a bit of history of how Chinese people were treated in Canada, and North America, in general, over that century. The story was interesting, and it did primarily focus on the most interesting person, in my opinion, May-ying.

Chan Sam, a peasant, leaves his wife behind in China in order to go to the fabled \"Golden Mountain\" as Western Canada was refered to at the time (1913). He brings with him his Concubine, a beautiful but no-nonsense girl, to British Columbia, living in Vancouver's Chinatown. Expectations are high that Canada was a land of riches. All spare money was sent back to Chan Sam's wife in China, and the Concubine and her children did without. The wife, Huangbo, raised their son & two daughters by the concubine in China; May-ying, the concubine worked hard as a tea-room waitress to earn money to support both the family in China and her husband and their own two children. Life was harsh, there were moves from Vancouver to Victoria's Chinatown. Gambling became a problem particularly with May-ying. This is a historical account of a time in the Lower Mainland of B.C. that every Canadian and American should read, there is so much history both of early B.C. and China, with China occupied by Japan, then the rule of Mao Tse Tung. A few years ago, the narrator Denise and her mother made the trip to China to visit what relatives they had there, and so the two families finally came together. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and read it when it first came out (about 1989; it has now been reprinted) and still keep my precious first copy paperback; I've loaned it or bought one for some friends through the years, that is how much I care about it. I have now read it a few times. Highly Recommended. A quote from Denise Chong: \"I didn't realize the extent of it, until I did my history, that my grandparents lived in Canada at a time when they could not participate in White society.\""}, {"userName": "Teghan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4020363-teghan", "userReview": "This book was given to me as a gift and I cannot for the life of me understand why I hadn't read this earlier! A breathtaking memoir that spans a century. Chong writes so intimately, laying forth her family's history for all to see, the bad parts and the good parts. There is a quote on the front cover from The New York Times Book Review that summarizes this book so perfectly that I have to repeat it here:\"Beautiful, haunting and wise, it lingers in the mind like a portrait one returns to often in a family album, and elicits the same mysterious response of love, melancholy and pride\"It does stick with you. When I finished it, closing the back cover over, I felt sad. In reality what was only a matter of days, it felt longer, you live with the Chan/Chong family through 90 years of history and experiences. It leaves an impression on you, feeling as if you almost know them. With that thought in mind, I next pondered that this was actually the life of someone....it is a memoir, not a biography done by a third party. This is the life of several still living individuals, who have put their entire private lives out there for us to experience. I am unsure I would be able to do the same. It is not the story of any particularly remarkable person or event. Its rather ordinary actually, its an experience that many Chinese-Canadians experiences one way or another. It is about real people, with all their complexities. I realized this as I was frequently flip-flopping between sympathy and animosity towards May-ying; but thats how we react to real people: they are at times wonderful and less so at other times. Real people are never understood in a binary of good or bad, its a complex mix and that is what this memoir is. The story of real people and in the process, it becomes remarkable."}, {"userName": "Hilary", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/276463-hilary", "userReview": "Fascinating and heartbreaking true story of Chinese immigrants in B.C.'s Chinatowns in the mid-1900s. This tale recounts the story of Chan Sam and his progeny. Chan Sam came to Vancouver to make his fortune at the turn of the century. After 11 years he is still waiting for his metaphorical ship to come in, while his wife and child remain in China. Anxious to produce a male heir, he takes a second wife, the titular concubine, who joins him in Canada. But this wife, May-ying, is no wilting flower and is not content to simply do Chan Sam's bidding. She wants independence, but is willing to keep sending her husband most of her earnings to get it. Especially tragic is that after decades of working difficult and menial jobs to send money to China, the land and homes purchased there were ultimately confiscated as part of Mao's lands reforms. The book provides fascinating insights into the world of Chinatown from the 1920s through the 1950s - the tea houses, the gambling dens, the rooming houses.

With the harrowing details in her hard-edged account of some sixty years of the lives of three generations of Chinese wives and daughters (all of it factual and presented with unsparing but calm deliberation,) Denise Chong provided a social commentary on ethnic inequality but even more so on gender inequality and poverty.May-ying came to Canada in 1924, as a second wife or concubine to Chan Sam, starting the saga that Chong (May-ying's grand-daughter) recounts. It is a story of complicated and conflictual relationships, involving two continents and various locations across Canada, but Chong navigates her tale with skill, plus brings alive a series of disparate characters (May-ying and Chan, their three daughters, two other wives, a disabled son, then the lovers to whom May-ying ultimately turns, the husbands of the daughters, Chong herself and her family.) And in the end, the tension mounts as, more than 60 years after 1924, both sides of Chan Sam's divided family finally come to confront each other within a changing China.I found this book slow going here and there, given the recurring conflicts and maternal failures of May-ying, whose experience of abuse pushes into alcoholism. It is also a grim and depressing book at times, as again and again white society of the time blocks the chances of Chinese Canadians to realize their dreams. But on another level it is also a hopeful book because so much has changed for the better over time for those whose origin is Chinese (like our two daughters.)Most of all, though, I am struck by what an honest, blunt book this is -- how clear and forceful it is in organizing its evidence -- and therefore what a fine piece of work Denise Chong has given us."}, {"userName": "Marcy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1140398-marcy", "userReview": "Chan Sam, married to a woman in China, takes on a concubine and moves to the new world of Vancouver, with the hopes of making a fortune to send home to China.

They started in China. Some stayed; some emigrated to Canada and returned; some emigrated and stayed, only to visit much later. There are a lot of themes. Exploration of the poor immigrant experience in various Chinatowns in Canada over the years. How hard her mother's parents had to work to support themselves and their families, both in Canada and back in China. Frustrations along the way: local and overseas interference; the Depression and two world wars; drinking and gambling problems; health issues; trust; different value systems. The worth of a salary in Canada vs. China during different economic periods. Contrast between the traditional Chinese, more modern Chinese, and more traditionally Western (as in Canadian/American) ways of love, marriage, schooling, work. Prejudice and discrimination against Chinese immigrants in Canada. Love vs. duty. First wife vs. live-in but unofficial wife. Husband vs. occasional lover. The value of land. The value of a house - and the risks of a fancy house in a down economy or during a revolution. Doing whatever is necessary (pretty much) to put food on the table. What that costs to oneself and one's children and other family members. Resentment over time - and eventually understanding, acceptance, and appreciation of those sacrifices.The maxim \"it could always be worse\" seems to apply throughout much of the book, as does \"where there's a will, there's a way\". I appreciated that the author tried to tell the story from both her side and the point of view of her family that stayed in China. It was not an easy story to read at times, but it was also not particularly harsh or violent. In all, it was probably a very typical story for many families."}, {"userName": "Louise", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2143983-louise", "userReview": "Story Description:To me, China was what was left behind when the boat carrying my grandmother, pregnant with my mother, docked in Vancouver.

The Concubine's Children chronicles a really interesting story of her grandparents' immigration to Canada, and the challenges they faced.

In these ways it reminds me of the wonderful novel (one of my favourites!) The Good Earth, not because of the China connection, but because of the commentary on humans' expectations on life -- and the dichotomies and also sameness between people everywhere. This book reads like journalism, like a long magazine article, and that makes sense, as that's really what Chong is -- a strong journalistic author.

It then follows the family through parts of their lives in Canada and China during the Sino-Japanese war, the Chinese Cultural revolution, the Great Depression that hit both Canada and America, and even the times of strong prejudice that the Chinese faced. Chong wrote the book as a compilation of her family's memories, and took a very non-sentimental tone throughout the entire book, even for what must have been emotional scenes of their lives. I thought it was well written, easy to follow the lives of those she collected the memories of, and very insightful to many parts of the Chinese way of life and attitudes. It is a great book for a Chinese history class. It would even work for a sociology or anthropology case study, really.

What kept it from being four stars was that I got a little confused sometimes between grandparents and parents and siblings, and also I got a little bogged down at times with the historical events of the time, although that was interesting. Nevertheless, this is an engaging story about a complicated family separated by distance and war. The struggles and pain suffered by everyone involved are communicated very well, and all the members of the family are presented as multi-dimensional, not simply as all good or all bad. I would say the last fifty pages are especially engrossing.
