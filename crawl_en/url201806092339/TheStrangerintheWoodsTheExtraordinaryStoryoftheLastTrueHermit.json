There were two stories here, but the author only told one. I understand why but I am frustrated so I added, 'just'.All-American kid age 20 abandons his new car and wanders off into the woods to live alone and make a career out of burglary. Strange eh? Not half so strange as his family who never even report him missing or make any attempt whatsoever to find him. The book would have been shorter if the author had stuck to the title but it was padded out with history, famous hermits, religion, motivation etc. some of which was interesting. There was a discussion on whether Knight had Asperger's, was autistic or schizoid. It reminded me of what Asperger himself said: Not to pathologise the merely eccentric. There is a difference between bat shit crazy and a clinical mental illness, we all know that. The second story, which was interesting in and of itself, was of the family. What family doesn't immediately report their 20 year old son gone missing to the police? What do they say to people who ask after him, friends or family? Aren't they anxious for his safety? Don't they wait by the phone for a call? The family wondered if he was alive. Wasn't anyone suspicious? Unfortunately Knight's family were so uncommunicative that there was nothing to report, only to surmise. Now it seems to me that these people have a pathological mental illness. When in prison, Knight himself didn't turn into a garrulous party animal after 27 years of not speaking to another soul, by choice. This made life a bit difficult for the author who has obviously tried his best to get to the root of why Knight became a hermit.It was an interesting book, but it wasn't fully fleshed out, and to a reader it doesn't matter why it wasn't, whether it was because of Knight being so taciturn, the author or the writing, only that the book didn't deliver a deep experience, the 'extraordinary story' when it promised to."}, {"userName": "Melissa \u2665 Dog/Wolf Lover \u2665 Martin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin", "userReview": "Wow! This book . . . I couldn't even put it down! This is the story about Christopher Thomas Knight who at 20 years old, walked into the woods and ever came out until he was caught at 47 years old. He lived in the Maine woods for all of those years in bad weather and in good weather. The only thing he did wrong was burgle cabins and Pine Tree which was a place for people with disabilities. He took any kind of food to survive, watches, books, propane tanks, etc. And when he was caught he confessed right away about these things and said he was sorry for it. He had 1000 burglaries over the course of his life. All he wanted was to live alone in the woods and survive. He never hurt anyone and he never damaged anything. The author, Michael Finkel met Christopher while he was in jail. He wouldn't talk very much. When he did open up I found that so many things he said opened my eyes even more to the world we live in and how being quiet in nature is more important than even writing this review. Too many things take over our lives and I would like to start simplifying more things then I already do. (which is going to take about 6 years!) Christopher didn't ever get a cold or any major issues accept for his teeth from a lot of the sugar he ate because when you live like that and you take what you can get. He was wearing the same glasses he was wearing at age 20, he was losing his sight but they fixed him up with some new glasses when he got caught. Chris knew the woods, his hearing became fine tuned to every little sound, even the minute ones. He never left any tracks. When he left his camp, he stepped in the same places that he had stepped in for years. The police were amazed about that while watching him when they followed him back to his camp. I'm just amazed at this book. I wish he didn't have to do all of the burglaries but I think he should have been left alone and there are a lot of people that feel the same. If I had a cabin in that area I would have left him out some food, mostly right before winter. A big lot that he could have over the course of the winter to survive so he wouldn't have to go and get so much stuff to make sure he stayed alive. He wasn't a free loader just because he stole food to survive in the woods. Seriously, I know some free loaders that just don't want to work and live off someone else. My cousin, she has one of those. I think if he could have had the nice part of the community to leave him some food and let him be alone in the woods that would have been a nice thing. He just wanted to be in the woods. He didn't want to sit in his house and watch tv or drink or do drugs, things free loaders do. He just wanted to sit with nature, listen to the odd pbs broadcast on his radio and read books. I didn't think it was right to bring him back, make him live with his family and work with his brother. The quiet was gone and he wanted to kill himself. I don't know what ever happened with that or how he is doing now. I really hope he finds a way to get back to his nature in some way. I thought while reading the book that maybe he could go out and live in the woods close to his family where he would have some quiet and his nature. I don't know. But he was always good and did what the police said and did his community service without any trouble. He never caused any trouble or denied anything when he was caught. Once again this book was so very good. I'm going to have to get my own copy since this was a library book. It was my own type of feel good book with some of the little things Chris said. I'm going to leave a few pictures below that came from the author's website taken from him and the Maine Police. There are more but you can go look yourself. And I will leave an excerpt or two. \nAnother decade elapsed. The break-ins at Pine Tree increased with both frequency and quantity of goods stolen. By this point, a quarter century in, the whole thing was absurd. There was the Loch Ness Monster, the Himalayan yeti, and the North Pond hermit.\n\nIt's possible that Knight believed he was one of the few sane people left. He was confounded by the idea that passing the prime of your life in a cubicle, spending hours a day at a computer, in exchange for money, was considered acceptable, but relaxing in a tent in the woods was disturbed. Observing the trees was indolent; cutting them down was enterprising. What did Knight do for a living? He lived for a living.\nHis mushroom friend that he watched grow from a baby.

As if catching himself getting a little friendly, he abruptly wrote that he didn\u2019t wish to reveal anything more.\u201dSo naturally he persisted in sending letters. Knight answered for a while (5 times), until he decided he no longer had it in him to respond. Finkel sent him three more letters after that, with no response so Finkel decided to fly from Montana to Maine to VISIT HIM IN PRISON UNANNOUNCED. \u201cI\u2019d simply shown up--I don\u2019t think any other journalist had, and he knew I lived far away. It would have been rude of him, he felt, to refuse my visit, so he\u2019d accepted it, and then was rude to my face.\u201dHe then proceeded to visit him 8 more times, flying back and forth from Montana to Maine and got Knight to tell him pieces of his experience. That last visit before Knight is released from jail, after Finkel again tries to shove himself into Knight\u2019s life by offering to help him find employment, Knight tells him \u201cPlease leave me alone. I\u2019m not going to miss you at all.\u201d Knight is released, goes back to living at home and attempts to adapt to a world he didn\u2019t want to be a part of. Needless to say, our author felt that he needed to insert himself back into the situation because HE\u2019S REALLY QUITE SPECIAL. He attempts contacting Knight's family via telephone where they all promptly tell him NO and hang up on him. That wasn\u2019t acceptable so he showed up at the workplace of his brother and proceeds to randomly question him, all of which his brother replies with \u201cThat\u2019s personal.\u201d The next obvious step is to show up at Knight\u2019s family home with a pie and flowers and have a chat. Am I the only one going \u201cWTF\u201d over here? After a conversation in which Knight makes it clear he\u2019s unhappy to see him, Finkel once again tries to contact a member of his family in person, and is caught by Knight who tells him he\u2019s done \u201cterrible damage.\u201d He tells him to go home, back to his family. \u201cGo back to Montana. The cowboys (his children) need their father. Leave me alone. Now.\u201dEver the White Knight, Finkel contemplates buying Knight a cabin for $16k because nothing says \u201cLeave me alone\u201d like gifting someone you hardly know real estate. He writes him many letters, which go unanswered, so what is our author to do? Get on a plane and go visit, of course. This time at least he writes to announce he\u2019s coming, which ends up in him getting a response: \u201cUrgently important that you leave me alone. Show me respect by leaving me alone. Please. If you appear I will call police. Leave me alone. Please.\u201dThat finally seemed to be clear enough for him, so he stayed home where he belonged, but kept tabs on him monthly by calling the District Attorney and other community members in Maine. Over his time visiting Maine he treated Knight\u2019s camp in the woods as some weird sort of religious site. He visited 5 times, some of which he camped there himself.

Capturing Knight after 27 years..... known as the \"North Pond Hermit\" was like \"netting a giant squid\". When captured he was wearing a pair of LandsEnd jeans - size 38 - with a brown belt:Stollen goods! Knight's story continued to be equally as fascinating after he was captured as much as why Knight chose a reclusive life in the woods of Maine in the first place. There are the details about how Christopher Knight survived: the many-many-MANY break-ins ......stealing food, supplies, books, etc. ......surviving the elements of the seasons... LIVING IN A WORLD WITHOUT WALLS......for *27 years*.....surviving psychologically... sometimes meditating and living as a hermit-criminal. ( I would have given him food - clothes - flashlights - batteries - and books too).... There is this fascinating 'cliffhanger- of -stories'....that happened once Knight was captured. Journalist from all over the world we're trying to get hold of Christopher Knight's story. Letters, phone calls, and visitors we're pouring into the jail. A woman offered to marry him. He was offered money, cleaning services, donations of all kinds. Knight didn't accept ANY of the gifts!!! Every TV network wanted their hands on the story. Five songs were written about Christopher Knight. People were curious. People wanted to help. People wanted to learn from Christopher Knight. Was he an explorer of life? And if so... what words of wisdom could he pass on? Or was he just crazy? I HAD HEARD 'OF' THIS STORY BEFORE LISTENING TO THE AUDIOBOOK. ..........I'd have to had been a 'hermit', not to.\"The Stranger In The Woods\", WAS SOOO MUCH MORE POWERFUL TO LISTEN TO MYSELF....... than everything I had previous read about it. In fact, I read tons of reviews ways back when this book first came out --/as I never thought I was going to read the book. I felt I 'got' the story. What else did I need? THE EXPERIENCE WAS MISSING UNTIL I LISTENED MYSELF!!! NO REVIEWS SPOILED 'my' EXPERIENCE!!!! NOT AT ALL!!!!!!'KNOWING' ABOUT THIS STORY WAS NOT THE SAME!!!!! I was expecting to be semi-critical. I 'mostly' belong with the believers that we should LEAVE THIS MAN ALONE.....\"he shouldn't have to talk if he doesn't want to\". -- but I think what was created with this book 'is' a contribution to MANY PEOPLE INCLUDING Christopher Knight. Knight was shy about most things - except literature and history. He would talk about books he read. I had heard that the author was a jerk - from a few readers. I don't feel this way. As I listened to this audiobook--my respect for author, Michael Finkel elevated. Finkel gave us ( the reader) background information---historically- about other 'hermits' which added a great context to Christopher Knight's story. We see from past history - monks - and other spiritual 'hermit's who found inner peace and wisdom. Hermits are a PRIMAL HUMAN INTEREST STORY!! I DID UNDERSTAND WHY FINKEL WANTED TO INTERVIEW KNIGHT. I ALSO FELT FINKEL WAS TENDER - COMPASSIONATE - and RESPECTFUL OF KNIGHT!! I found it very sweet when after Michael Finkel wrote Knight a hand written letter -- a man close in age as Knight - who also loved to spend long periods of time alone with himself. (Enjoyed camping and reading - alone).....Knight wrote Finkel back and said, \"it was very sweet that you wrote me a personal note\". Point is. .. THE LONGER I LISTENED ... I came to believe that Knight and Finkel developed a 'lovely' friendship of equal respect. I'm glad I read it....It gave me a bigger picture than I had previous thought. Whatever I 'thought' I knew about this story 'before' .....didn't come close to the magnitude of the actual facts."}, {"userName": "Michael Finkel", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49053810-michael-finkel", "userReview": "I greatly appreciate all of the reviews here -- even the bad ones!

It tells the story of a shy man who just decides to leave civilization one day and head off into the woods. He lived completely by himself and survived by robbing a neighboring camp and cabins. For twenty seven years. TWENTY SEVEN years.I find that part just fascinating. Christopher Knight didn't announce any reason for his departure he just went. We probably would be okay with never knowing anything else. I admit to being curious about his everyday life and exactly how he survived the brutal Maine winters...because I'm a nosey bitch. I don't really like a whole lot of people either so I could totally see the wanting to be away from them. Probably not that long of a time period but still.Now...before you get your panties all in a snitch about my rating. I DID think this book was very readable...I finished the thing in almost one day and that is unheard of for me lately. BUT THE THING PISSES ME OFF!Why? Christopher Knight did NOT seem to ever really want to be 'interviewed' by Michael Finkel. He actually did not want to see him. So what does Finkel do? He flies from Montana to Maine SEVERAL times to see him. \nThe last part of this book had my stomach kinda twitchy..and IT TAKES A WHOLE LOT TO TWITCHY ME! The author admits after Knight finally leaves jail he flies out to see him and his family tells him NO several times. Does that stop him? Freaking hell no. He shows up at the dude's mom's house with a freaking pie and plant branch. (I think lilac but I had stopped caring by this point) Is that the same kinda thing as showing up at a reviewer's house? Both seem kinda over the top to me..I am giving this stupid ass book 1.5 stars because I admit to being creepy enough that I at FIRST wanted details about this poor man's life. After reading how the details were gotten I just feel freaking dirty and wish that the man had just been left alone. I'm ashamed I read it. I'm not ashamed to review it badly. Sometimes I do feel bad for giving a book a low review because I know reader's tastes are different. This one just pisses me off. I feel like this author just wanted to make a buck off this poor man and I'm pissed off about it. He can kiss my fat butt. Booksource: I got this sucker at the library.

Is it fact or fiction? I don\u2019t suppose this story ever showed up on my Newsfeed here in Texas, or if it did, it didn\u2019t register with me at the time. But, I will say, that as an extreme introvert, I am no longer concerned about my tendency to avoid social gatherings, because Christopher Knight\u2019s case makes me feel like a social butterfly by comparison.Christopher Knight when \u2018off grid\u2019 shortly after graduating from high school and spent the next twenty-seven years of his life living in the woods in rural Maine. To survive, he rummaged through summer cabins, uninhabited camp sites and such, and stole food, radios, batteries, and all manner of other items to live on. He soon earned the moniker of \u2018The North Pond Hermit\u2019 and was highly sought after by the police. One day, while rummaging through an off season camp site, his luck ran out and he was arrested. This is when Finkel became involved in starting up a correspondence with Christopher, that led to the writing of this book, and if I\u2019m not mistaken a documentary as well. This story is fascinating, due in part, to how Christopher managed to survive those brutal Maine winters out in the woods. But, he was far more brilliant than I would have imagined. He\u2019s smart, very smart, but he just didn\u2019t want to live around people. If he had done it the right way, without stealing from people, it really would have been much more remarkable, and he would still be out there living the life he prefers. It is hard for people to understand someone like Christopher. I can relate to him in many ways, but certainly have no desire for that extreme manner of solitude. Yet, someone who shuns society, who is different from the norm must be psychoanalyzed the nth degree and it was suggested to the reader that Christopher may have some symptoms of Asperger\u2019s or maybe even schizophrenic tendencies. Christopher\u2019s childhood can account for some of his behavior, I would think, since he was raised in a rather isolated environment. Christopher knew how to survive without constant companionship and apparently had no real need of it. The one thing the book really takes a hard look at, is why? Why would someone deliberately choose to do what Christopher did? There are various reasons people become \u2018hermits\u2019 and it\u2019s not as uncommon as you might think. Yet, in Christopher\u2019s case, he doesn\u2019t fall into any of the usual categories and offers no real answers to this all consuming question. The saddest thing about this story is that Christopher was forced back into society, and is obviously miserable. Yet, he was a thief and he frightened people, and a crime is a crime, even if no one was physically harmed. So, he had to pay his debt to society. This is certainly an interesting story, and it\u2019s hard to believe all of it is true, but truth, as you know, can be stranger than fiction. It\u2019s an amazing story of survival, and a riveting character study, and an overall fantastical, incredible true story. While some people doubt aspects of Knight\u2019s story, and I\u2019m one of those people who remains skeptical at all times, no matter what, but there is enough physical evidence to back up the story so, I see no reason to doubt him, at this time\u2026 *note: Finkel did commit the ultimate journalism faux pas by falsifying reports on child labor in Africa, at one time. I don\u2019t know how I feel about Christopher. I think people should live their lives as they see fit, and if he wants to live out in the woods all alone, I suppose that\u2019s his prerogative. However, he should not have broken the law or rationalized his crimes in order to maintain his chosen lifestyle. While I do feel his discomfort and even understand it to some extent, I hope he can make peace with his life now and will become a productive citizen using the obvious gifts he was born with. I do wish him the best. 4 stars"}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "At the age of twenty, Christopher Knight, leaves his large though taciturn family, his job, and society as a whole and disappears into the Maine woods. He will live within a short distance from others but make no personal contact, will steal what he needs from cabins left empty from the winter or weekend and survive totally on his own. When he is caught, never having physically harmed anyone, he will not have spoken to another human being for 27 years. I have never read anything like this, cannot even imagine for a minute this appealing to many, but for this young man it was a total life of freedom. This is not a book on nature, though of course it is mentioned and Christopher relished nature in all its many forms. It is a book of quiet and solitude and a different way of finding joy in living one's life the way one wants to or maybe even needs is the better word choice. It is astonishing and makes one reflect on the things we value, take for granted.Can you imagine not speaking for 27 years? We have a new salt room in my town. I asked my daughter if she would care to go and her response was, An hour is a long time not to talk, I don't think I could be quiet that long.\" How many of us are ever quiet for any length of time and yet for Christopher this was the life he preferred. The author hears about the story and contacts him in jail, surprised when he shows up at the prison and Christopher agrees to see him. Regardless of how one feels about how the author got this story, one can tell he was much impressed and later very concerned about this now 47 year old Man's future. Where does he go from here?

He wasn't discovered until 2013, when he was caught stealing food from nearby cabins. In those nearly three decades, Knight lived outdoors in a tent, never once sleeping in a building. (This is an astounding feat considering how cold Maine gets in winter.) He devised an ingenious campsite that was hidden behind boulders and surrounded by dense trees. His only real problem was food, and he frequently had to steal supplies to stay alive.\"It's better to be tough than strong, better to be clever than intelligent ... I was tough and clever.\" \u2014 Christopher KnightMichael Finkel heard about Knight's story on the news and was intrigued enough to send him a letter. At this point Knight was being held in jail for his burglaries, and after some correspondence, Finkel flew to Maine to meet him. It was difficult getting Knight to open up, but eventually he shared stories of his time in the woods, and some reasons why he felt the need to escape society.While reading, I was reminded of another beloved book, Jon Krakauer's Into the Wild. It's a similarly fascinating story about a young man, Christopher McCandless, who felt the need to escape into nature, although McCandless ended up dying alone in Alaska. What Finkel was able to do in The Stranger in the Woods is to get a modern-day hermit to talk about his reasons for wanting solitude in nature and for isolating himself from other humans. The insights into Knight's behavior were interesting and thought-provoking.\"All his life, he'd been comfortable being alone. Interacting with others was so often frustrating. Every meeting with another person seemed like a collision.\"Besides conversations with Knight, I liked that Finkel included examples of other hermits throughout history, and also some relevant research from psychologists and sociologists. There are also great literary references throughout the book, since Knight liked to read so much. I would highly recommend The Stranger in the Woods to everyone.Favorite Quotes\"In many cultures hermits have long been considered founts of wisdom, explorers of life's great mysteries. In others they're seen as cursed by the devil. What did Knight wish to tell us? What secrets had he uncovered? Or was he just crazy?\"\"Two of life's greatest pleasures, by my reckoning, are camping and reading \u2014 most gloriously, both at once.\"\"Knight lived in the dirt but was cleaner than you. Way cleaner. Pine needles and mud don't make you dirty, except superficially. The muck that matters, the bad bacteria, the evil virus, is typically passed through coughs and sneezes and handshakes and kisses. The price of sociability is sometimes our health. Knight quarantined himself from the human race and thus avoided our biohazards. He stayed phenomenally healthy.\"\"His chief form of entertainment was reading ... The life inside a book always felt welcoming to Knight. It pressed no demands on him, while the world of actual human interactions was so complex. Conversations between people can move like tennis games, swift and unpredictable. There are constant subtle visual and verbal cues, there's innuendo, sarcasm, body language, tone. Everyone occasionally fumbles an encounter, a victim of social clumsiness. It's part of being human. To Knight, it all felt impossible. His engagement with the written word might have been the closest he could come to genuine human encounters.\"\"I have no desire to travel. I read. That's my form of travel.\"\"Modern life seems set up so that we can avoid loneliness at all costs, but maybe it's worthwhile to face it occasionally. The further we push aloneness away, the less we are able to cope with it, and the more terrifying it gets. Some philosophers believe that loneliness is the only true feeling there is ... We live locked in our own heads and can never entirely know the experience of another person. Even if we're surrounded by family and friends, we journey into death completely alone.\""}, {"userName": "Ammar", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3569723-ammar", "userReview": "Michael Finkel's The Stranger in the Woods is the mesmerizing account of Christopher Knight's disappearance into Maine's forests for 27 years. For reasons Knight himself never fully articulates, he abandoned civilization for a hermit's life in his early twenties. Knight made his home in a small camp encircled by concealing boulders and dense flora just three minutes (by foot) from a nearby cabin. Developing into a master thief, he survived by stealing from the cabins and camps in the area -- though never from his unwitting host's home. His ability to survive unmolested for so long at the edge of civilization in such a hostile climate testifies to his amazing abilities and perseverance.Finkel is a capable and captivating writer whose efforts here were hamstrung by Knight's recalcitrance. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Knight proved a reluctant, taciturn participant in the author's effort to memorialize his amazing story of survival. That Knight willingly met and corresponded with the writer as much as he did proved amazing. But Knight provided Finkel with few direct insights into what his decades in the woods taught him, and doubtless had many adventures he will never share with anyone.Despite Christopher Knight's limited cooperation, Michael Finkel presents a masterful portrait of the recluse, offering fascinating perspectives and theories on the life and motivations of this modern-day hermit. Writing a book about such a reluctant subject takes rare skill, perceptiveness, and patience.

It is another world altogether, literally offering a deeper level of thought, a journey to the bedrock of the self.\"Can you think of a time when you isolated yourself for some quiet time? No communication with the outside world or other beings? I can remember a time in my mid twenties when my routine was as follows: after work on Fridays, I would turn off my phone, head to the grocery store for some weekend staples, pick up my holds from the library, and make one final stop at the mailbox for my bundle of three Netflix films. Thereafter, I would shut myself in at home with awesome reading material, my dogs, and some classic movies (usually long epics that would slowly smolder over the weekend). I craved this quiet time away from people, even on social media, which to this day I find grating. Work and social interactions just depleted me during the week, and I found these weekends restorative at a very hard time of my life. It was about this time that I read Into the Wild, and it moved me to my core. I am an introvert, but that doens't mean that I don't enjoy people and socializing. However, at my core, I am most content when on my own with my animals. It warms my heart when I read about others who are similar.When I heard about this book and Knight's quarter century lived out of doors, alone but surrounded by people, I knew I had to read it! I was not disappointed at all, because I could understand what he was seeking, albeit his solace at times put him in great danger of losing his life. \n\"The dividing line between himself and the forest, Knight said, seemed to dissolve. His isolation felt more like a communion. 'My desires dropped away. I didn\u2019t long for anything. I didn\u2019t even have a name. To put it romantically, I was completely free'...This loss of self was precisely what Knight experienced in the forest. In public, one always wears a social mask, a presentation to the world. Even when you\u2019re alone and look in a mirror, you\u2019re acting, which is one reason Knight never kept a mirror in his camp. He let go of all artifice; he became no one and everyone.\"\nThis was a fantastic read! I wish it hadn't ended so abruptly. I was hopeful but a little sad, too. The afterword and acknowledgment pages provided a lot of supplemental reading material on solitude and other hermits that I'll definitely be looking into."}, {"userName": "F", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8161922-f", "userReview": "I was sent this book from Goodreads.I really enjoyed this book.

He made camp at a hidden spot near a place called North Pond and survived by repeatedly burglarising the surrounding cabins, most of which were uninhabited for much of the year. Astonishingly, he wasn\u2019t caught until 2013 and up until then had become a local legend dubbed the North Pond Hermit. Journalist Michael Finkel interviewed Knight several times while he was awaiting sentencing and the end result is The Stranger in the Woods, as near a full account of Knight\u2019s years in the wilderness as any we\u2019re likely to get. This book was great! I\u2019ve never read anything by Michael Finkel before or knew anything about Chris Knight so was pleasantly surprised on both counts \u2013 Knight\u2019s story is absolutely fascinating and Finkel is a terrific writer. Beginning with Knight\u2019s fateful nocturnal raid when he is finally arrested, Finkel takes the reader on a fast-paced, yet thorough, tour of Knight\u2019s life, from his rustic childhood with his self-sufficient, stoic farming family, to suddenly deciding, two years out of high school, that he was done with the world and randomly took to the forest. As well as providing a clear and compelling picture of Knight\u2019s zen-like existence over his hermit years, Finkel is careful to include the perspectives of Knight\u2019s \u201cvictims\u201d (I use quotation marks as his crimes were so benign; stealing Twinkies, batteries, jeans, etc.) as well as those who don\u2019t believe he lived in the woods for so long as the Maine winters are too brutal. It makes for a well-rounded, considered overview. Though Knight comes off as intelligent and articulate, he is, understandably for someone who chose to live as he did, a man of few words (when asked what profound insight he gained after untold hours spent alone thinking he said \u201cGet enough sleep\u201d) who steadfastly refused to document his experiences. And while Knight opened up to Finkel a fair bit, some aspects to his story remain unsatisfying from a narrative viewpoint, particularly regarding his motivation. To that end Finkel includes details on historical hermits, expert opinions on Knight\u2019s possible autism, and the tremendous benefits of being alone, all of which provide added context and possible explanations for Knight\u2019s choices. The part where modern hermits ponder whether or not Knight was a \u201ctrue\u201d hermit was amusing as were the qualifiers - does stealing count or should he have lived off the land? Still, despite the author\u2019s efforts, Knight remains unknowable and mysterious which seems fitting. It\u2019s a odd contradiction: Chris Knight\u2019s everyday existence - made up of the usual domestic chores - was wholly unremarkable and yet it was remarkable for how he chose to do it - completely alone, in the woods, where nobody knew where he was. The story certainly lives up to the book\u2019s subtitle - Knight\u2019s life is certainly extraordinary! Michael Finkel\u2019s writing style is always clear, informative and entertaining. Combine the accessibility and compelling subject matter to the relatively low page count at just under 200 pages and you\u2019ve got a helluva zippy read.

I truly enjoy my fair share of alone time and being independent - I\u2019m just fine with silence, but could not fathom doing it for 27 years, alone, in the woods, with no technology and barely encountering just 3 people in that time period. Christopher Knight took hermitting to the extreme. The Stranger in the Woods shares his story. Knight walked into the woods in Maine one day as a 20 year old, and didn\u2019t leave until he was caught stealing food from a camp site, 27 years later. He survived by stealing from cabins - food, propane tanks, gameboys & books (for amusement, naturally), and other items, creating his own \u201chome\u201d. He never lit a fire, even in extreme brutal winter conditions, as the smoke could have attracted unwanted visitors. He had little desire to seek happiness in the modern world so, he just walked away. It\u2019s extremely odd to me that his family did not seek assistance in finding him, or search themselves. Knight was not residing far away from his parents home where he grew up. To not inquire about the what, where, how and why of a missing 20 year old son raises a red flag, to me. This book tells the story indicating his family just accepted him as \u201cgone\u201d, some assumed he was dead, and let it be. Not all families are the same of course, but this is one aspect of the story I found truly baffling - The lack of pursuing the result, to find out either way.As I read the book, I felt Finkel, the author, became increasingly aggressive or at least too persistent in his pursuit of Knight. While I\u2019m glad he wrote the book, because as stated above, it\u2019s a fascinating story, I thought to myself, \u201cAh, really?! Why is he going to Maine again when Knight told him he wants to be left alone?\u201d At a few points, the way some things were phrased, I felt Finkel was working really hard to find commonalities with Knight, his subject for the story. Sure, this may be a journalism tactic but when done well, not always so obvious. I didn\u2019t love this aspect of the book, which I didn\u2019t truly feel until the final third of the book, but it wasn\u2019t enough to detract from my enjoyment of The Stranger in the Woods as a whole."}, {"userName": "Connie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie", "userReview": "Have you ever felt like getting away from the stress of modern life for a few days? Christopher Knight took that idea to the extreme, walking into the woods of Maine and living in isolation for 27 years. He was an introverted, intelligent twenty-year-old with a dry sense of humor. He had been brought up in a family that prided themselves on their practical skills and self-reliance, and set up a camp hidden by large boulders. But Knight had to steal food, batteries, books, and other supplies from a nearby children's camp and from vacation cabins in central Maine. He waited until the vacation homes were vacant before breaking in, but the homeowners felt frightened and tense as over 1000 burglaries occurred in the area. When he was finally caught stealing by a game warden, Knight felt deep remorse. Knight had survived brutally cold winters, and terrible mosquitoes. He never got sick because he had almost no exposure to the bacteria and viruses that humans pass to each other.Knight was evaluated by psychologists, but he did not really fit a particular diagnosis, although he exhibited some traits of autism and schizoid personality disorder. Why would someone want to be socially isolated? \"One's desire to be alone, biologists have found, is partially genetic and to some degree measurable. If you have low levels of the pituitary peptide oxytocin--sometimes called the master chemical of sociability--and high quantities of the hormone vasopressin, which may suppress your need for affection, you tend to require fewer interpersonal relationships.\" (69)The author, Michael Finkel, includes information from his correspondence and conversations with Knight in jail. The author and Knight shared a love of camping and reading that created enough of a bond that Knight talked to Finkel. Background information about other famous hermits in history was also interesting. But those historical figures usually had help from the church or friends who provided their food. This was an engaging story told with compassion. I found the story of Christopher Knight so fascinating that I had my head buried in the book all day. 4.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2473504-jennifer", "userReview": "\u201c...sometime in the 1990s, he encountered a hiker walking in the woods. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d asks Vance. \u201cI said, 'Hi,'\u201d Knight replies. Other than that single syllable, he insists, he had not spoken with or touched another human being, until this evening, for twenty-seven years.\u201d\n\n Dang, that's some solitude right there. After no identifiable antecedent, Christopher Knight walked into the woods of Maine at the age of twenty years old and never looked back. In an effort to support his lifestyle, he burglarized unoccupied vacation cabins for food and supplies, racking up over 1,000 incidents of burglaries and becoming a well-known and well-feared ghost of the area of Pond Lake. Journalist: Michael Finkel built enough rapport with Knight to complete interviews with him which resulted in a GQ article and then this book. In The Stranger in the Woods: The Extraordinary Story of the Last True Hermit, Mr. Finkel discusses Knight's upbringing, his exit from civilization, his lifestyle of \"aloneness\", the town's response to having a hermit in their backyard, the true crime element, and my personal favorite: the act of solitude itself with the reasons why people from past to present in varying cultures voluntarily engage in it. I enjoyed learning about this subject through the perspective and detailed research of a quality journalist. Never once does Mr. Finkel justify Knight's criminal behaviors or advocate for them to be overlooked or rationalized. Both Christopher Knight and Mr. Finkel hold Knight responsible for his actions, as does the judicial system, so don't let an assumption to the opposite dissuade you from reading this book.

This book has me conflicted! I listened to it, narrated by Mark Bramhall, and he was excellent. What follows are my thoughts on this book while trying to avoid spoilers, (even though the synopsis tells a lot already). Perhaps my feelings will become more clear as I write.What I found most fascinating was this: think about how long you've gone in your life without talking to or touching another human being. I'm talking phone calls, internet, or hugs. As the author points out in this book-most of us have gone only a matter of hours. Imagine going for 27 years. Is a person who has a need for quiet and silence sick? Are they autistic? Are they schizophrenic? Do they have Asperger's? The author asks all of these questions-of doctors and regular people alike. I couldn't help but wonder why everyone thought something was wrong with Christopher Knight. Is it so wrong to want to avoid people, noise, news, television, and electronics? Is that abnormal? I guess 27 years with no contact does seem strange, but sick? I'm not sure about that.A number of philosophical views were also offered as well as quotes from many different books about hermits and recluses throughout history. Views on solitary confinement are also discussed, with most agreeing that solitary is a type of torture. Here's what bothers me most: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with what the author did to get the information for this book. While I did find this story fascinating, the hermit himself asked Mr. Finkel to leave him alone on a number of different occasions, yet he persisted-not only visiting him in jail, but also visiting him in Maine once he was released. (Christopher Knight was incarcerated for a time, due to his repeated thefts of food, books and other items.) I'm not sure if I view this as honorable or as harassment. I can't deny, however, that I did keep listening. I loved the parts that were direct quotes from Mr. Knight, because he had such a clear view of how he saw things/nature/people. Did all of these things make sense to me? No, but they sure did cause me to rethink my views on the world and all of its noise and distractions.I will also admit to a bit of envy when Knight spoke of one of his deep winters in the Maine wilderness when there was NO SOUND. Nothing whatsoever. No animals, no planes, no birds, no chatter, nothing at all. It's hard to imagine that.Well, I wrote all this and I'm still conflicted. I guess I am glad that the author pursued Mr. Knight because I did find this tome to be fascinating at times. It's just that I feel Knight's wishes were disrespected and I hate the thought of that; and I hate that I took part in it by listening to this book. Which probably makes no sense at all, but there you have it."}, {"userName": "Ron", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43881851-ron", "userReview": "The extreme examples in life interest me. Those who climb mountains, strike their own path, live through tragedy, walk into the wilderness alone. This true story about Christopher Knight is like that last example. What I didn\u2019t know before reading the book is that Chris actually lived very close to civilization, almost unbeknownst \"neighbors\" surrounding a small lake in Central Maine. If he had not broken into their cabins for necessities to live, they would not have guessed another lived just a stone\u2019s throw from their summer homes.After getting to know Chris, I didn\u2019t want to use the word thief to describe him, but he would not argue the term. When finally caught, he freely admitted to stealing, never sought to absolve himself, and hated the fact that he had done so for so long. Some of the cabin owners held onto their anger, but most forgave immediately. They would give more. He\u2019d become their Hermit legend, their ghost in the night. For 27 years Chris had lived outside of our world. At twenty years old, he walked away. Literally. Why? He was a man who felt out of place. That sounds strange to most. Crazy even. But he is actually a highly intelligent person. Just different. People want to fit a round peg in a round hole, yet we are not all the same shape.I did not expect this to be an emotional read in any way. But near the end, I had come close to tears for this man out of place. *Spoiler ahead* That spot in the forest he called home was the only place Chris felt truly right in this world. Michael, the author, stands near him just asking him how he is getting along, now that he cannot go back. Here, in this moment, became the one point that Chris truly let another person in, and in doing so both men stood with tears in their eyes. They barely knew one another, but there it was. (I won\u2019t reveal the words expressed here.) I will say that it caught me completely off guard. Finally, I see the kinship Michael had come to feel for Chris because it\u2019s expressed in the way the story is written.

For someone to leave society for 27 years and have no contact with people is a bit odd. I am also at odds about him stealing in order to survive. No, he didn't harm anyone but..... Amazing to me that he survived the winters.

Christopher Thomas Knight*****Christopher Thomas Knight grew up in in the small town of Albion, Maine with his parents and five siblings. The Knight family - which was exceptionally clever, capable and self-sufficient - kept to itself, rarely interacting with neighbors or other townsfolk. This may have factored into Christopher's decision to isolate himself from all human contact when he was a young adult. Knight appears to have had a relatively normal childhood, during which he attended school and even had some friends. After graduating from high school, Knight got his own place and briefly worked for a security company. Knight left the job unexpectedly - without even returning his tools - and embarked on a road trip, driving all the way to Florida. Then, in 1986 - when he was 20-years-old - Knight returned to Maine, abandoned his vehicle, and hiked into the woods - where he proceeded to make his home. Knight carefully avoided human contact while he looked for a spot to establish his campsite - a place that wouldn't be found by hikers or hunters, and which couldn't be seen from above. After trying out a half-dozen locales, Knight finally found the perfect site - a boulder-shrouded clearing near North Pond in central Maine. Knight proceeded to make this his residence, and lived there - isolated and alone - for the next 27 years. Knight didn't even contact his parents, who - he later speculated - thought he was 'off on an adventure.' Needing supplies, Knight repeatedly broke into cabins around North Pond. Knight was a master thief, using his knowledge of security devices to good purpose. Knight never took expensive items, but stole 'necessities' like: food, candy, clothing, tents, sleeping bags, mattresses, blankets, propane tanks, flashlights, batteries, toiletries, watches, books, Playboy magazines, radios, electronic games, bug spray, small amounts of cash (in case he ever needed to go to a store), and so on. The thief, whose identify was unknown, became known as 'The North Pond Hermit' - and people in the area grew increasingly frightened, angry, and frustrated as the vandalism went on week after week.....month after month.....and year after year. Surveillance equipment was installed in some cabins, and in a summer camp that was one of Knight's favorite targets, but the hermit was too wily to be caught. Finally, monitoring devices became too sophisticated for Knight to evade, and he was apprehended in 2013 - at the age of forty-seven.Knight's picture caught in a surveillance photo during a burglary A hermitic existence in the woods wasn't easy, but Knight perfected his routine over the years. The recluse took sponge baths, brushed his teeth regularly, and - though he never had a mirror - shaved and trimmed his hair. Knight washed his clothes, and - when his tent and bedding got moldy - changed them out for new (stolen) ones. The hermit kept his food in waterproof containers, ate easily spoiled items first, and always buried his trash. This cornucopia of garbage - when unearthed by police after Knight was arrested - provides a fascinating picture of his 'menu.' Fearing discovery, Knight NEVER lit a fire - even in the frigid Maine winters. That he didn't freeze to death - or even get frostbite - is almost unbelievable (to me). I get cold fingers and toes just thinking about it. Brrrrr!The author of this book - journalist Michael Finkel - wrote to Knight in jail, while the hermit was awaiting trial for more than 1000 robberies. Knight never became 'friendly' with Finkel, but acquiesed enough to exchange several letters and allow a few visits....all of which provided Finkel with material for this book.Knight grew a beard in jail, while awaiting trialFinkel describes Knight's forest adventures in great detail, and tries to comprehend the reasons for the recluse's behavior. This is a tough call, since Knight himself can't explain why he went into hiding. To try to understand Knight, Finkel researched - and writes about - hermits throughout history. The writer describes their philosophy, religion, behavior, means of survival, etc. Finkel also interviewed many psychologists, and includes their observations in the book. Finally, Finkel speculates that Knight may be on the autism spectrum, though this doesn't really explain his desire (or perhaps need) for extreme solitude. Once Knight was arrested, he had to endure jail, interviews with police, and interactions with lawyers - all of which was very difficult for him. Eventually, the hermit was compelled to return to his family, get a job, and conduct himself like an average person....which almost drove him to suicide.This is an interesting book about an unusual person, and would be a good primer for an outdoorswoman (or man) who likes to camp out. The book doesn't, however, provide any 'universal truths' about anything. Still, it's a fascinating story, well worth reading.

Christopher Knight did just that - except he lived totally alone for 27 years in the woods in Maine, with extreme weather and no human contact except for one \"hi\" when he accidentally came across a hiker.The word hermit conjures up a vision of an ascetic who goes off to live a solitary life for spiritual enlightenment. Mr. Knight does so simply because he prefers to be alone. He survives by stealing supplies from cabins and camps but he feels immense guilt over doing so. He had a bit of an unusual family and upbringing, so much so that his very private family didn't even report him missing to the authorities.It's fascinating to read about someone who can live so long without human contact. It is not what we consider \"normal\". I couldn't help but think he is either mentally ill or on the autism spectrum. But it's unclear if he is either and who are we to decide?

Almost too hard considering the cognition and emotive perceptions and receptive states of the hermit of this book's subject, Christopher Knight. And the title? Is he really the \"last true\" hermit? I completely doubt that and if he could do if for 27 years, than others have too.This is worth the read. The chapters 20-22 were 6 star, and some of the rest, especially in the first half was heavily padded with historical reference to past hermits, celebs, and literary figures of solitude. In majority all of them were extremely depressive and nearly life long morose, btw. Many suicides in the group, and never a single laughing or \"jolly fellow well met\" among them. IMHO, many of the most loved historical classics are sprouted from depressive cognition. It seems people like to read about the misery of being human and analyzing the futility? I don't. But most do by numbers. Is this autism spectrum or schizoid personality? That section was also well done for background reference and professional opinions. It was 5 star.But truly, and this is only my own opinion that follows. I believe Knight has a combination of characteristics that give him a core which is most realized and the least tense/anxious for his own skin (internal/physical/mental-all of it) when he is at the door of the \"Lady of the Hood\"- just this side of being frozen (physically frozen). The stillness of that is part of it, but it's more combined with his personality disorder. Just as some people feel most alive when being cut. Usually by themselves. He is definitely an outlier. I doubt I would have tread in the path of this author to push him as far as he did.If you have ever been robbed, had your home sacked (usually it IS more than once), or had your most private spaces violated or assaulted- you will have a much harder time rationalizing his modus operandi to perform this desired lifestyle for 27 years. Nor be as analytical about his post-arrest current lifestyle. This kind of \"why is this gone\" and \"who moved the screens\" terrorizes people. Often it causes extreme personality changes and far more than short term, as well. So he feels \"guilty\" about his 1000's of break-ins! That and a dollar might get you a candy bar. Maybe. As age advances this became harder- he could no longer carry all those propane tanks, for instance at once. Christopher would not have managed this much more than 3 or 4 more years. Not much past 50 as he was recouping physically more slowly every season. Maybe he would have preferred this route, a final winter? Pretty sure he would, or will. That French female in the mid-1980's who did the deep cave solitude that is mentioned in the cognition/mood chapter of historical references for recent experimentation! I was super interested and researched her, long ago- had to be in the 1990's. And before the internet for sure. And her eventual suicide was hidden, either purposely or not, I'm not sure. Interesting that now all that kind of aftermath becomes nearly immediately available and nothing remains sacred. Nor does personal information for such a case become or stay private.The quotes about how these particular highly \"separate\" outliers dwell on the very edges of sane- those are pithy. And actually truly realistic. This is definitely worth the read. His familial pattern is especially instructive to the genetic and emotive patterns that were considered \"norm\" by this Knight birth group."}, {"userName": "Marchpane", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6677659-marchpane", "userReview": "Such a fascinating book, I absolutely tore through it, despite feeling it was a flawed depiction.

Though he remained seemingly invisible, every day his legend grew.In 2013, the thief is caught, and his story is unbelievable: In 1986, Christopher Thomas Knight left his home in Massachusetts without saying goodbye to anyone. He drove to Maine, abandoned his car, hiked into the woods, and lived in solitude for 27 years, without speaking to or touching another human being. He was a real life hermit.This book is a compelling portrait of a solitary man, his unbelievable existence, and his ultimate capture. In the case of The Stranger in the Woods, truth is definitely stranger than fiction: Finkel gets inside the mind of a man who had gone to great extremes to be alone, to leave behind most of the comforts of civilization to live a life on his own terms (albeit one in which he needs to steal Cheez-Its, peanut butter and other sundries from local vacation homes in order to survive).I was touched by this man\u2019s decision to leave it all behind, in a world where we think we have so little control over our very brief time on this planet. Who hasn\u2019t fantasized about running away and living alone, about never having to work or face the everyday worries and troubles most people experience? But here is a man who actually did it!As a proud Mainer myself, I remember hearing about the mysterious thefts over the years. The legend, the hermit, and the Maine surroundings are what drew me in to this very interesting book, and I loved everything about it.Read more at https://www.bookofthemonth.com/the-st..."}, {"userName": "Terri", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1270803-terri", "userReview": "Excellent book that didn't leave my hands until I finished it. Good writing and a compelling story. I cared about both of the men in the book, the sensitive hermit (Christopher Knight) from Maine, who just wanted to be left alone in his woods and the determined journalist who was trying to understand him. The story really picks up in the second half and I liked that the author, Michael Finkel, was fair in sharing his opinions of him and the situation. The saddest part of the tale was that Christopher Knight was forced to break into vacation homes for supplies and food. It not only destroyed the well-being of the people who suffered multiple break-ins but it took a psychological toll on Christopher as well. This novel is highly recommended for book clubs because it is a book that begs to be discussed.I had many questions after reading it and I look forward to reading some other reviews here on Goodreads."}, {"userName": "Darlene", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1809697-darlene", "userReview": "\"Modern life seems set up so that we can avoid loneliness at all cost; but maybe it's worthwhile to face it occasionally... some philosophers believe that loneliness is the only true feeling  there is.\"This incredible book, 'The Stranger in the Woods: The Extraordinary Story of the Last True Hermit' written by Michael Finkel, poses some thought-provoking questions... questions which really have no definitive answers. This book tells the story of Christopher Knight who became known as the 'North Pond Hermit'. In 1986, just a couple of years after graduating from high school, Chris Knight left his young life behind and entered the Maine woods where he would live in complete solitude until his arrest nearly three decades later for stealing food form the Pine Tree Camp for disabled children. Chris Knight spent those years living in a tent he had cleverly modified with odds and ends he had stolen from empty cabins. These empty cabins were also the source of his food, clothing, batteries, propane tanks and even books. It was only through the diligence of a particular ranger with the Maine Forest Service that he was ultimately captured at Pine Tree Camp.Although I had not heard of Chris Knight's story prior to reading this book, it apparently had captured the attention and imagination of numerous journalists... one in particular was the author of this book, Michael Finkel. Mr. Finkel sent a letter to Chris Knight in jail and to his surprise, Chris Knight wrote him a letter in return. The two corresponded through 8 letters and cards and eventually, Mr. Finkel made trips to the jail in Maine where Chris Knight reluctantly met with him a total of 9 times. This book is a result of that correspondence and those jailhouse visits. From the conversations between Mr. Finkel and Chris Knight, it was clear that Chris Knight is an intelligent and articulate man; but it is also clear that he was experiencing a great deal of difficulty in trying to assimilate first into his life in jail and later, he would experience the same struggles at his family's home. Chris Knight related to Mr. Finkel that he did not like to be touched in any way. He also could not maintain eye contact.. preferring to carry on conversations while looking at a point over Mr. Finkel's shoulder saying... \"I'm not used to seeing people's faces. There's too much information.\"Michael Finkel had had an interest in the idea of solitude and the lives of hermits throughout history. He believed that people throughout history who had endeavored to live such a lifestyle had discoveries and knowledge to share with the rest of the world. If he was hoping to receive such knowledge from Chris Knight, however, I can't help but believe he must have felt somewhat disappointed. If Chris Knight had made any discoveries or had come to any conclusions about life or in particular, about a life in solitude, he either could not or would not articulate that wisdom. Although He spent every day for nearly 30 years reading or simply sitting in silence and observing the world around him, he had no real wisdom to share.... except that the life he had been living was the life he had truly wanted for himself. In fact, it had been his intention to spend the rest of his life in his self-created solitude. He found life among society unbearably painful.... and that was difficult to read. Was Chris Knight a 'true' hermit? Opinions seem to be split on this. Some people feel he is not a true hermit because he obtained what was necessary to live by stealing from others. Many of the owners of the cabins he had stolen from expressed that they had lived in fear all of those years Chris Knight had been breaking into their cabins... how were they to know he would not have harmed them? I could really relate to their feelings because several years ago, my own home was broken into in the middle of the night. It took many months for me to feel safe enough to sleep through the night. Of course, there were others who felt that Chris Knight HAD been a hermit and should have been permitted to continue his life as he wished. I believe the author leaned in that direction as well. Mr. Finkel provided examples of hermits throughout the history of the world, all of whom had had community support and contact with people to obtain necessities when it had been required. He discussed early Christian hermits who had lived in caves but who still held communal gatherings; he also discussed extreme Buddhist monks who had food delivered to them. How had Chris Knight's lifestyle been different from these earlier hermits? Why DID Chris Knight walk away from his life.. a life that had not really begun? I don't believe anyone has the answer to that question.. perhaps not even Chris Knight himself. Some psychologists speculated to the author that perhaps Chris Knight had schizoid personality disorder and some proposed that perhaps he is on the autism spectrum...but these were hypotheses posed by people who did not know and had never examined Chris Knight. It's possible no one will EVER know the reason Chris Knight chose to live in solitude. I personally found Chris Knight to be an extremely sympathetic person. I would not want to spend years away from society but I have found that as I get older, I don't mind solitude and quiet. In fact, I very much enjoy it for small periods of time. Chris Knight's personal story was captivating but I found myself thinking about this book in broader terms.. on more of a societal level. Perhaps Chris Knight's choice to live outside of society was so fascinating was because he was engaging in the opposite of what people are socialized to do from birth. We are taught from birth how to be sociable.. how to act, how to speak, how to interpret social cues.. all so that we might fit into society. We are taught that being part of society is good for society, There are many slogans which seem to celebrate and promote people's individuality.. 'think outside the box' and 'dare to be different'.. but in reality, being different and standing out is not the message society wants people to receive. All of our socialization seems to discourage solitude. Certainly there are societal benefits to encourage social cohesion... sticking together under a shared set of mores and laws prevents chaos and lawlessness. But people hear Chris Knight's story and they are intrigued....Viewing Chris Knight's years of solitude on a more personal level, I believe I can actually find a bit of wisdom. In these days , despite our ability to connect with people around the world through the advances in technology, people continue to describe themselves as lonely and many self-medicate with prescription drugs for depression and anxiety. I believe that the mind numbing manic chatter sometimes increases those feelings. Perhaps Chris Knight has provided some very simple knowledge we can utilize. For me.. I don't need to escape from society for decades but maybe every now and then, I can disconnect from the world and simply sit and listen... to the summer breeze which is rustling the leaves on the tree outside my window... to the sigh of my old cat as he turns himself into a more comfortable position for sleep... and the beating of my own heart in the stillness... those peaceful, soothing sounds of silence...."}], "description": "Many people dream of escaping modern life, but most will never act on it. This is the remarkable true story of a man who lived alone in the woods of Maine for 27 years, making this dream a reality--not out of anger at the world, but simply because he preferred to live on his own.In 1986, a shy and intelligent twenty-year-old named Christopher Knight left his home in Massachusetts, drove to Maine, and disappeared into the forest. He would not have a conversation with another human being until nearly three decades later, when he was arrested for stealing food. Living in a tent even through brutal winters, he had survived by his wits and courage, developing ingenious ways to store edibles and water, and to avoid freezing to death. He broke into nearby cottages for food, clothing, reading material, and other provisions, taking only what he needed but terrifying a community never able to solve the mysterious burglaries. Based on extensive interviews with Knight himself, this is a vividly detailed account of his secluded life--why did he leave? what did he learn?--as well as the challenges he has faced since returning to the world. It is a gripping story of survival that asks fundamental questions about solitude, community, and what makes a good life, and a deeply moving portrait of a man who was determined to live his own way, and succeeded.", "title": "The Stranger in the Woods: The Extraordinary Story of the Last True Hermit", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30687200-the-stranger-in-the-woods", "average": 3.88, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1474560136l/30687200.jpg", "reviews": 3558, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/206768.Michael_Finkel", "name": "Michael Finkel"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15011468.Mark_Bramhall", "name": "Mark Bramhall"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Biography", "Autobiography"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30687200-the-stranger-in-the-woods", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30689330-the-stranger-in-the-woods", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33000005-the-stranger-in-the-woods", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33028631-the-stranger-in-the-woods", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34497070-the-stranger-in-the-woods", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34006738-the-stranger-in-the-woods", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34739739-the-stranger-in-the-woods", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/361148.True_Story", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12367972-here-be-monsters-50-days-adrift-at-sea", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/361122.Alpine_Circus", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41227.The_Best_American_Nonrequired_Reading_2002", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/131095.The_Best_American_Travel_Writing_2001"]}
