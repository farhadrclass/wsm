And maybe people were like collages - no matter how broken or useless we felt, we were an essential part of the whole. We mattered.\nThis book is wonderful in many ways. My only \"criticism\" (more of an observation, maybe?) is that I honestly don't think it needed to develop into a romance. I loved the characters and their stories. I thought both Skylar and Josh were fascinating and \"real\" characters, but I didn\u2019t think they needed to be a couple.So many contemporary books explore the problems and heartache of middle class teens. Not that they don't have valid problems too, but it was so refreshing to see the focus turn toward underprivileged poor kids in a trailer park. Kids who are expected to marry young, get their own trailer, and have some kids while nursing an unhealthy alcohol habit.Skylar has bigger ambitions, though. She's got a college scholarship and after the summer is over she can finally get out of Creek View for good. That is, until her mom loses her job and her dreams begin to fall apart. Josh Mitchell, like other young men from Creek View, always had limited options. The only way he could get out and do something good was to join the marines, but instead of being his ticket out, it landed him right back where he started, minus a leg.There are two sides to this story. On the one hand, you feel the stifling claustrophobia of being in a small town and being unable to escape. You want Skylar to get out so badly. But this also isn't a snobby disdainful view of these poor, lower class people. I'm from a poor background myself and it would have pissed me off if it hadn't been handled well. But Demetrios portrays all these wonderful, colourful and completely unapologetic people with love and sensitivity. Through Skylar, she criticises slut-shaming, racism and homophobia. Many of the characters are guilty of these at some point, even Josh, and yet it feels realistic and important. Through Skylar, she also shows that everyone has a story and needs, wishes, ambitions...There are so many great secondary characters - Marge, who acts as a mother figure to both Skylar and Josh, Skylar's mom and the sad story that emerges with her, Chris and his relationship with Skylar, and Dylan who is actually happy with her trailer and baby. As I said in the beginning, the book just had so many strengths without the romantic aspect. I liked how Skylar and Josh needed each other, but I never felt like I wanted it to go beyond friendship. But whatever, it was a beautifully-written, thoughtful contemporary.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Pinterest"}, {"userName": "Lola  Reviewer", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14596170-lola-reviewer", "userReview": "3 1/2 stars.\nIt gave me hope: if you could make a beautiful piece of art from discarded newspapers and old matchbooks, then it meant that everything had potential.

But then again, I didn\u2019t cry while reading The Fault in Our Stars so, perhaps \u2013 perhaps \u2013 it is just me that has a heart made of stone or the illusion of it, when picking a book full of drama up. But I was actually surprised by the lack of necessity to shed a tear; I was expecting this story to transform me into a helpless cry-baby creature \u2013 because MILITARY. There\u2019s something about this subject that makes me feel so sad and melancholic. I can\u2019t even describe you the wreck that I was after finishing Dear John. I loved it but nevermore. Nevermore. That\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t bring myself to buy a physical copy of it\u2026 I don\u2019t even know how I survived the movie.Well, I unconsciously drifted off topic (this book) so let\u2019s slowly return to I'll Meet You There. It was clear, after reading the author\u2019s note, at the end of the story, that she did a throughout, or so, research on life after war, physiological war damages on human beings, how war can change a person, and so on. And there were buckets of information but, since Josh rarely talked about his time at war and kept all painful and rough memories secluded, I couldn\u2019t envision the schedule he followed daily back in Afghanistan. He couldn\u2019t have just\u2026 fought non-stop during the day (or night?). Maybe this is me getting too deep into the subject, something the author\u2019s didn\u2019t plan on doing, but I\u2019m quite curious. I guess I\u2019ll have to make a little research or read one of the books she recommended.The characterization \u2013 even for the less important characters \u2013 was splendid! What frustrated me though was seeing how Josh let himself appear as a player and selfish person when, obviously, his chapters showed us a part of him that was completely different! And he knew what people thought of him and didn\u2019t even care. He only cared about Skylar\u2019s opinion and, even then, he messed up quite a few times with her. The ending is easy to predict, because YA + contemporary romance (you know how it goes), but what I liked was that both characters focused on themselves as human beings and what they wanted, needed, and didn\u2019t skip steps. Slow-burn and angst in abundance! If you enjoy realistic fiction books dealing with real life problems and powerful themes, such as forgiveness, acceptance, family, friendship and what it truly means to love someone, then don\u2019t hesitate to grab a copy of this novel!"}, {"userName": "Aimee \u2665 | Aimee, Always", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5478965-aimee-aimee-always", "userReview": "Warning: Prepare yourself for much incoherency and babbling.Book hangover (n.):\u00a0When you've finished a book and you suddenly return to the real world, but the real world feels incomplete or surreal because you're still living in the world of the book. -- iciclethe828, Urban DictionarySo, now y'all know how I'm feeling.

He tasted like the future.\"One of the many things I love about goodreads is having friends who understand how exciting it is to find that special, meaningful, add to all your favorite lists kind of book. It doesn't happen very often, but when it does, ahhh, I love it! I love books that make me feel a range of emotion, because those are the ones I will remember and come back to. This book is so good, it's one of those you can't stop thinking about, even when you aren't reading. I was worrying about these fictional characters in the back of my mind as I did normal real life things for last couple of days. I don't even feel like I can do it justice, but it's too good not to review.Skylar and Josh live in a remote, miss it if you blink tiny town in central California. The description of this area was so spot on. I live in Oregon, but spent summers growing up in towns just like this in North Eastern California. The heat, the dust, the isolation, she brought me right back there. When I go back to visit, it's so strange being in a place where you have to drive for an hour and a half to be able to shop in a real grocery store. The \"casino\" in the town where some of my relatives still live is a couple of slot machines in a double wide trailer. Lol. \nJosh joined the Marines right out of high school, and at nineteen has returned from Afghanistan missing a leg, with emotional scars that run even deeper than the physical ones. His character was just so real and believable. He feels lonely and isolated, because no one in this town can possibly even begin to understand what he's been though. The chapters in his pov were so heart twisting, because I could feel how lost and traumatized he was. He returned to his old job at the Paradise motel, which is where he re-connects with Skylar. He is comfortable with her, and their friendship grows until it slowly builds to much more. \"I ran my fingers along the raised letters on the dog tags that spelled out all the pertinent information the military needed about Josh. But the important stuff-how he watched out for me, how good he was at chess, the way he always hit his knee when he laughed-they weren't the sort of things you could stamp onto a thin piece of metal.\"Skylar has her own struggles and I loved how Josh looked out for her. It was the little things that made me love him and feel the butterflies. She lives in poverty even though she is working, because her mom has just kind of given up. Skylar worked hard in school, and has a scholarship to a college in San Francisco. She desperately wants to escape this town to make something out of her life, but the situation with her having to take care of her mom is making her feel conflicted. She is an artist, who loves to make collages. She doesn't have money, but she found a way to make beautiful art out of paper scraps. She was so resilient and persevered even though her life at home was crappy. I haven't read a book that did this good of a job describing what it's like to live in poverty since Eleanor & Park. \nThis is one of the best Y/A, N/A books that I've read. I think I have found a new favorite author. Her style of writing is so beautiful and poetic, but it's still readable.

I don't usually enjoy them, but when I'm in the mood for them I'm very choosey about what I select. I've been hearing such rave reviews about I'll Meet You There so I figured I'd see what all the hype was about. I'm so glad I did! IMYT is a sweet, heart warming tale about Josh and Skylar, whose world's collide after she just finishes graduating high school. When it came to our two main characters Heather did an amazing job giving them both very different, distinctive, and interesting voices. Skylar isn't super outgoing, but at the same time isn't shy. She has this light humor about her that gives her such ease throughout the story. She has just graduated high school and is on the edge of her seat about leaving her run-down small town. She is set up to go to\u00a0an art school in San Francisco and is counting down the days until she will get there. She is currently\u00a0working her part time job at the Paradise Motel until college starts. This is how she knows Josh, our other lead. The two in previous years have spent time working together at the motel and have always been friendly with one\u00a0another, but never serious friends. Josh however\u00a0graduated high school the year before her, and like many others in the town, left and joined the marines. While out serving\u00a0overseas he is injured, losses a leg, and winds up back in Creek View working as the motel's handy man. Before leaving he was your\u00a0typical cocky jerk high school guy. All about cracking jokes, going to parties, and getting girls. Now that he has arrived\u00a0back he just doesn't see the world the same anymore. He isn't the laid back brat he once was. He has matured a\u00a0lot and is seeing things in a whole new light. These two characters managed to be very similar in their struggles while both facing very different issues. I think that even if this\u00a0book wouldn't have taken the characters down a romantic journey (it does) it would have still held up\u00a0just fine. I really think that says a lot about\u00a0both the writing and the plot. My absolute favorite thing about\u00a0IMYT is the friendship between Skylar and her two best friends, Chris and Dylan. All the characters\u00a0in this book felt so authentic, but these three together were flawless. I think the reason I thought they were so perfect is because\u00a0they weren't perfect people. First off I love that they were all so different, but wasn't the type of different where they felt like they were forced friends.\u00a0I actually felt like these three people would hang out with one another (if you're an avid reader than you know what I'm trying to get at). Chris is this math \"nerd\" who is about to attend college in Boston and Dylan is a saucy\u00a0teen mom who works a the local restaurant. The three fit so well together. The second thing\u00a0that I loved is that Heather didn't make Chris secretly in love with Skylar. I loved that she had the two hanging out, going places, ad experiencing things together all while\u00a0just being friends. I couldn't get enough of the\u00a0moments when it was Chis and Skylar just hanging out. Having everything from secret eye conversations to the pact that they formed, it was just great.\u00a0There's one scene in the book where all three of them are in the car and get into a fight, and it just felt so real. It's an argument I could easily see so many people having, and it plays out just how it would in real life. The setting of this story was another huge plus. It felt like it started becoming its own person. This living breathing thing. The motel really feels like it becomes this own private secret hide out for Skylar and Josh. Even the quirky rundown town has this certain warm feeling and really sets the mood for this book. I liked that there were so many little places for these characters to go, and it gives the story a little something extra. That all mixed with a smooth running solid plot that isn't overshadowed by one certain aspect made this\u00a0novel a\u00a0knock out read. The message, romance, and plot completely sold me. \n\nKnowing all the hard work, research, and time that went into this book really shows. This is a simple book that found it's own way to stand out. It's a book with a slower pacing, that manages to never be boring. A\u00a0book with a beautiful message that is never blocked out and will hit you in the heart. You would think with a book that weighs so heavily on being character driven that it would miss a beat on other aspect, and it just doesn't. \n\nI'll Meet You there \n\ndefinitely pulled on my heart strings and wont be a book I easily forget.\n Read this review and others over on my blogBetween the sheets & covers blog Between the sheets & covers blog Between the sheets & covers blog"}, {"userName": "Lucia", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8837962-lucia", "userReview": "This book.

My hands were shaking, and my lips tingled, and the skin around my wrist-the part that Josh had touched-the skin was singing.I am always the black sheep on stories like these. When I first got an account on Goodreads, I tried to conform to what popular reviewers were reading and I was sure there was something wrong with me because I would read them and just feel\u2026Nothing. Such classics as The Sweet Gum Tree and others like The Edge of Never and way more that I could care less about remembering were so highly spoken of on here and I just knew I had to like them. And I did\u2026.A little. But the whole time, while I read them, all I could think was, \u2018Why is this so popular? Literally nothing is happening and this drama\u2026Why the drama??\u2019 I, for the life of me, could not find this deep and spiritual connection that everyone was getting with these stories. The drama felt forced, to me, and I just kept rolling my eyes because life isn\u2019t that hard. It just isn\u2019t. And, while it\u2019s awesome that people adored these stories, they bored me. Yet I rated them highly and grasped onto the few good things in the books that excited me so I would fit in (I recently have been trying to rectify all those old false ratings). Why?? What was I trying to prove?? These books just Were. Not. For. Me. And that\u2019s okay! So, my whole point is, in a roundabout way, that I avoid these types of books because I just have extreme difficulty reading about daily life with very little going on-It drags, frankly, and I just need something, anything to feel even an ounce of enjoyment. That is\u2026until this book.Sky turns around and waves and she has this little smile on her face and suddenly I\u2019m okay, like she broke through the mess of me. I remember I don\u2019t need to be at that razor\u2019s edge anymore, so I drive home. I don\u2019t realize I\u2019m smiling until I see my reflection in the side mirror. Didn\u2019t even recognize myself.-Josh\nThis book is everything I try to avoid: Slow pace, daily activities and trivial dramas, and small town bias. But Holy Shit, guys. Nothing could have prepared me for how deeply I felt for these characters. That town. That life. It all seems so trivial, learning about where our main character works and how she and Josh have always worked together at the Paradise Motel. But I swear to you, I swear to you all, this book was not slow. It was not boring. Not one page passed where I wasn\u2019t drooling over the writing or tearing up for Josh or wishing for a better life for Sky. It\u2019s like this book was made for me.  The drama felt real. The pain felt real. The sacrifices and friendships and slow-building relationships weren\u2019t forced or misguided-they were genuine and authentic. Everything happened for a reason-Or maybe it didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t know, but what I do know, for certain, is that I\u2019ve never felt such a deep-rooted connection, that physical connection I oh-so-crave, with a contemporary quite like this. It was a long story, but it never once felt excessive or drug out. And I just want to hug my IPad and squeeze it tight and never let it go, because I just don\u2019t know how to let go of these characters and I never wanted this story to end. \u201dHow\u2019s the Sky today?\u201d he asked, his voice soft.*****What am I supposed to do when I\u2019m bad for the one good thing in my life? -JoshI guess I better say a little about the characters, shouldn\u2019t I? I mean, they ARE the reason I\u2019m so obsessed, right? Right. Okay. So\u2026.First we have Sky. She lives in a trailer park-has her whole life-and hates Creek View, the town she\u2019s grown up in. She longs to get out of Creek View, to learn and create and to absorb art to it\u2019s fullest extent. She wants more out of her life, more for her mother\u2019s life. Longs for the people in town to want more, need more, strive for more. Well, she has her ticket out-A college in San Fran far from Creek View\u2026and all those she loves and might be leaving behind. It isn\u2019t until she is set to leave Creek View, after having spent a summer with the new [and somewhat improved] Josh, that she begins to see the beauty hidden underneath the grime and rough edges of Creek View. It\u2019s seeing your friend die and then trying to scrub his blood off your boots except it won\u2019t come out. The water turns pink and your hands are shaking and you\u2019ve got what\u2019s left of someone you were just standing next to under your fingernails and you need these boots for inspection so they gotta get clean, they gotta get clean, and suddenly you\u2019re angry, so fucking angry, stupid bastard had to die all over me, and then you\u2019re crying like a fucking baby and the boots are red and there\u2019s nothing you can do.-JoshAnd Josh. Oooooooh my sweet, tortured soul, Josh. He makes mistake after mistake, reads situations in all the wrong ways, has a reputation and has made a name for himself that any sane person would run from, and is scarred beyond belief after his tour in Afghanistan-both physically and mentally. Needless to say, he isn\u2019t without his flaws. Some from the war, and some he is still trying to overcome from before he left for the war-Namely womanizing, a loose tongue, and a party-boy attitude. But it\u2019s more than that, now. What if it\u2019s all a front, sometimes, to cover up the pain he feels from losing friends, seeing things he should never have seen, from people only seeing his prosthetic leg, or even just the God among men brat that he was before the war? How does someone handle what no one else understands? Time to move on, buddy. I don\u2019t really know what it means to move on, but lately, with Sky, I\u2019m starting to feel like I want to because when I look at her, I don\u2019t see you or the war or any of the shit in my head. I just see her, and it\u2019s like suddenly I can breathe again after holding my breath for so long. -Josh\nI\u2019m not going to lie. Some of the things that happened would normally have made me irate. Like\u2026Very irate. But, for some reason, literally nothing bothered me about this story. All the pain, all the heartache, all the tears, they were totally worth it. And I\u2019m not one to embrace such brutal words or harsh misunderstandings\u2026but it worked. Every little piece. And I wouldn\u2019t change a damn thing. None of it. In fact, I wish in my heart of hearts that I could re-read this right away, right now, but I can\u2019t. So, I\u2019ll savor all these slices of perfection that were handed my way and I won\u2019t look a gift horse in the mouth. But I\u2019ll tell you this: None of you are safe. I am a book pimp, through and through, and you WILL hear about how much I loved this story\u2026.Over and over again-take my word for it. Oh, and also, I WILL be re-reading this at the first available opportunity. You bet your ass on that. \u201dYeah, well\u2026\u201d There was the sound of some shuffling, then, \u201cOh, hey, you know what I ran across last night?\u201d\u201cDo you mean ran literally or figuratively?\u201d\u201cHa-ha,\u201d he said.\u201cSorry, I couldn\u2019t resist.\u201d\u201cGuess you\u2019re keeping me on my toes,\u201d he said.\u201cAll five of them.\u201dJosh laughed. \u201cI walked right into that one--er, limped.\u201dWhether it\u2019s my mood or the moment or the horrendous book I read before this (though I highly doubt it\u2019s the last one) I found an instant favorite. Like\u2026straight to the absolute favorites shelf-Which, like, never happens. I kept putting this story down, trying to do normal person, every-day activities, and would realize I still had my IPad glued to my right hand. And, even after I finished, I kept trying to start my next book-I tried to pick it up four times, but I had to keep putting it down because it just felt WRONG, like I was cheating on these wonderful characters I had fallen so deeply in love with. I had no idea what this book would come to mean to me, no idea that this book was so deep and meaningful I wouldn\u2019t be able to function. And, in the end, I might even say it\u2019s one of the prettiest covers I\u2019ve ever seen\u2026Since I TOTALLY get the understated simplicity and significance of it now and, more likely, because it WILL be on my bookshelf\u2026IMMEDIATELY.

It\u2019s a book that will make you feel and think, with two endearing main characters that for sure will make you root for them and a great love story. Skyler just graduated and all she wants is to escape from her small town, Creek View, California. She wants more, she wants to experience new things, to meet new people, she wants to get out. She doesn\u2019t want to be like other people from her small town, like her mother. She wants to study art and she plans to go to college in San Francisco. She has plans for her future, dreaming to work in an art museum, or teach art or something else. She has lived all her life in a trailer park and even if she has her mother and two best friends she feels she deserves more.Josh joined the Marines after he finished high school. Now at 19, returned from Afghanistan missing a leg he's tortured and scarred physically and emotionally and all he wants is to forget, to not feel this pain he feels every time he closes his eyes. He\u2019s not the same boy who went to war. Now he has a prosthetic leg, nightmares and memories he would do anything to forget. Skyler and Josh knew each other from before, but they reconnect when Josh return to his old job where Skyler already works. What starts as a lovely friendship becomes more and both Skyler and Josh have to be honest with themselves and with each other trying to figure out what they really want to do with their lives.I really enjoyed this story and its characters. One of the aspects I loved here is the slow build relationship between the two main characters \u2013 Skyler and Josh. I love how they became friends, how they got to know each other again, how they connected with each other and how ultimately they fell for each other. I really felt for these characters and I have to say I really felt their connection. Since this aspect is very important to me, I really appreciated the author created this strong, beautiful connection between them. Skyler was a great heroine and I connected with her from the beginning. She\u2019s a great friend, hard-working girl, she\u2019s kind hearted, loyal, she\u2019s sweet and supportive and so strong. But what I really liked about her is how much she loves her mother. Despite the fact she has her own dreams she\u2019s ready to sacrifice her future to be with her, to help her, to be there for her. Her relationship with her mother is not perfect, but felt very authentic. Both of them have flaws, because no one it\u2019s perfect, but in some way I understood them both. Her struggles are so well portrayed. I understood her and I felt for her. I also loved her dedication and her collages. Josh was a great hero as well. My heart broke for him. He\u2019s so damaged and lost and like Skyler she\u2019s so lonely. I\u2019m glad he found in Skyler everything he was looking for \u2013 a friend, a lover and maybe a soul mate as well. Who knows? He knows how damaged he is, that he will never be the same, but like Skyler he wants to find where he belongs. He still hopes that he will find his place in this world and maybe he will find someone who will love him and care for him exactly how he is. Josh\u2019s pain is very well portrayed. I really felt his anguish and how lost and lonely he is.The slow pace in this story really worked for me. Maybe some readers will be bored, but IMO it was perfect. There\u2019s some drama and also some angst, but nothing overwhelming, because everything in this book, even the drama was portrayed in a very realistic way. Nothing felt too much. Skyler and Josh\u2019s friendship is so great and I loved the teasing and the banter between them. Their romance is sweet, tender and beautifully written and the connection between them is palpable and fantastically done. I loved the way they are with each other and also their honesty and how easily they communicate with each other.While I really enjoyed the story I had two minor issues with it. Minor, because they didn\u2019t affect my rating too much. The first one it has to do with Josh. There\u2019s a scene where I totally wanted to smack him in the head!! WTF, Josh?? Really? Personally I didn\u2019t see the purpose of \u2018that\u2019 scene, but maybe it\u2019s just me. Anyway...My second issue was the ending. It was great, but it wasn't satisfying. Not for me. IMO it was a little abrupt. I wanted to see how their relationship progresses, if Josh stays in Marines, I wanted to know more about Skyler\u2019s life in San Francisco etc. It could have been nice if the story had at least an epilogue. That being said this was a fantastic, emotionally read and I\u2019m glad I give it a go.Overall, a good read!"}, {"userName": "Laurence R.", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32492014-laurence-r", "userReview": "Oh, how I've been dying to read this book. AND RIGHTLY SO!Really, I loved this book. It's the kind that I will have to reread at some point, because I adored it. It made me cry (sob, wail, tear up, name it) and I was a wreck, simply because of how sad the story is. I must admit I wasn't expecting this, since I just wanted another adorable love story to distract me from school, and while it was exactly that, it was also so, so, so much more. It touches subjects I don't usually read about, which is awesome and really brave.I loved how the characters both have burdens. There's none of that \"my love will save you\" crap that some (read: many) YA books promote, which I found quite surprising. It's more realistic to have two broken characters mending themselves together than one perfectly fine character helping the other one out, so even my mind couldn't make me dislike this book because of a lack of probability. I was heartbroken by both of the characters' stories and as I'm writing this, way too long after I finished reading this novel, I still remember countless details about it and I think about it more than ever. It made me see more of a universe I never knew, so I'm glad I read it. The love story develops itself beautifully, really. I felt so many emotions while reading this book that anyone talking to me during this time would've thought I was the one falling in love, because I was, in a way, with their romance. It was deliciously complicated and realistic and heartbreaking yet heartmending, which made me want to cry and dance and scream. For some reason, from the very first moment I heard about this book, I knew it would be like that, so I'm really happy that, for once, my intuition was right. If you're looking for a cute YA book dealing with darker subjects, I would recommend this a thousand times. It's definitely one of my favourites now."}, {"userName": "Alex Farrand", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37663070-alex-farrand", "userReview": "[My first goal was looking for inaccuracies, which honestly were miniscule. Marines do not wear their uniforms in public. When my father was in the Marine Corps you could get out of you car and get gas, but new rules states Marines cannot even do that. The only time you would see a Marine in uniform is in their pictures, a parade with their dress blues, wedding with their dress blues, and if they are deploying. Apparently, it is \"disgusting\" if you wear them in the civilian world, since the Army wears theirs around in public. There is a feud between the branches. I read that Marines find it disgraceful for all the people who died while in uniform. If you see a guy in uniform it is not Marine. If you do, they better hope no salty war veteran sees them and disgraces them.I had to ask my husband, because I wasn't sure of the differences between a below the knee and above the knee prosthetic. Ronald is a below the knee, while Josh was above the knee. I found it weird when the author described how Josh put on his leg. She said something about placing on cloth socks, and then putting on the leg. The leg part was accurate, because it pins to their leg since they do not have knee. The cloth sock is what is wrong. Like my husband he has a liner, which form fits to the nub. It is the smelliest thing, and it rips hairs off his leg. Then he places the nub socks around that liner depending how big or small he needs his nub to be to fit inside his socket. The socks are different sizes, and depending on the activity he has to constantly remove or add socks to make a snug fit. Sadly, due to inactivity of certain muscles his nub will degrade. I assume the same will arise in an above the knee amputee. Those are the two I can really recall at this moment, but if there is anymore I will share. I believe the author really did her research fairly well, especially with the PTSD, TBI, depression, frustration and anxiety. PTSD is different from person to person. Josh had it pretty bad because he was scared of loud noises, moments of impotency, night terrors, etc. Ronald somehow has very good coping skills. He is a strange man to begin with, since he is so mellow for being a marine. He is the most relaxed guy I ever met. I am not sure if he experienced any of these symptoms before we were together, but I have never noticed anything. I am afraid eventually he will have some PTSD symptoms when he is older. Luckily, I do not have to worry about getting punched in the face in the middle of the night. Yes, there are stories that wives or girlfriends getting punched.Not saying he wasn't depressed. He was very upset that he couldn't be in Afghanistan with his unit, felt like he wanted to die, excessive drinking and drugs. It is very sad. The military does look for these signs in their wounded, but they do not follow them around like momma bears. It is their own responsibility to go to therapy, and things like that. Ronald wasn't a very good patient, and he hates being forced to do ANYTHING! He could of learned to walk better in his prosthetic. Most below the knee amputees you wouldn't even notice that they have a prosthetic, because they walk normally. I don't understand how he became a Marine, but I know he liked it. Ronald did have to go to AA meetings, because of his drinking problems. Josh drank to remove the memories, and it is the way (sadly) how military members work. With someone who is depressed and has PTSD you just have to be really patient. It takes time, and understanding. It is hard work for their families.The one thing I did really like that the author wrote about is the frustration of having one leg. Ronald gets so frustrated at times when he cannot perform a task. There isn't many times, but sometimes he gets downhearted about his leg. He wasn't the greatest athlete or anything, but he hates when his leg stops him from doing something. I cannot recall the last time he got angry, but when Josh was watching a group of guys playing football it reminded me of a time when he yelled about his leg.Phantom pains do happen. Ronald said he had to pretend to itch his missing foot a few times.TBI -Traumatic Brain Injury-it is like a huge concussion. Some military members don't even need to be blown up, but just be around a ton of explosions. It can cause processing to be slower, speech impediments, memory problems, headaches, and things in that nature. Ronald has TBI. I can see at times while speaking to him that what I am saying is not processing very quickly. Sometimes I do not think he is even listening. Ronald is very intelligent, but things work their own way. The author just mentioned this term, and I just wanted to give more information. This too can be a broad spectrum. She didn't really show Josh having it, but you can assume he did.Another relatable aspect of military life is the amount of people who come up to Ronald, and say thank you for your service. It is always awkward, and all he can say is \"thank you\". He doesn't think himself as a hero either, like Josh. He had to return home after a short deployment. The real heroes are still out there fighting. Funniest part is when little kids ask \"Momma, what is that?\" while pointing at his leg. I laugh all the time, because of the curious little kids. Adults, and teens seem to stare, which annoy me. Just ask him what happened, he will tell you it is from a shark bite while he was surfing in California. His leg has inappropriate stickers on it, but it is better to ask then to stare.I liked how the author mentioned why Josh joined the military. There a multitude of reasons to join the military, which are benefits like the GI bill, getting out of your town and away from family, there is no other option, I just want to be a killing machine, etc. My husband say the only reason anyone joins the USMC is because you are either crazy or dumb. The other branches have way better benefits, and more comfy positions compared to the Marine Corps. My dad would never let me join the Marine Corps. If I did join any branch it would have to be Air Force. I know the whole situation is awkward, and I tried to think of how I reacted the first time seeing Ronald's prosthetic. I don't think I acted differently, and I meant to ask Ronald if I did, but I truly believe there were no thoughts in my head. Weird to think now how much I wanted him to be in my life. I knew he was the one for me. (Sorry to be so sappy) Leg or no leg, it just didn't matter. I know I didn't ask him about it. I treated him like anyone else. I hate to say abled or disabled, like there is a real difference between us. Clearly, Ronald is more abled than I am. He still is his He-Man self, climbing the roof, getting low to grab things, trying to run, etc. Last weekend, he step on the deck railing, and climbed the roof with the help of my father. No wonder women live longer then men. He lived more in his 21 years of life than I have in my 27 years. He knows his limits, when he needs a rest, but this man can do anything. Ronald, even drove a motorcycle for a little bit. I just want you to think about that when you see someone who is different. It irks me to hear when someone says \"I didn't think Ronald could do that. I am surprised that he can do something so normal.\" I am going to take this from  Wonder , but he is just ordinary. There is no difference. Josh could do anything too, if you gave him the right space. Ronald tries to make me feel bad for him at times. \"Alex can you turn off the light? I have my leg off,\" or \"Alex I left the food out, can you put it away? I have my leg off\" Me: \"No, I was here first. Hop your happy ass and turn off the light,\" or \"Ronald, you ate last, put the food away.\" Ahh, married life. I am not always mean, I know when he is really in pain and when he is trying to make me pity him. Why am I giving it 4 stars? I was expecting more on Josh's side. I know it was in Skylar's perspective, but there are a lot more struggles on Josh's side that could of been said. It is not all being amputee either.In general, military life is completely different from civilian life. It is like going into a completely different world. It is a dictatorship, and your life is run by routines, PT, class, shooting, training, driving, eating, and more working out. A lot of military members struggle in the civilian world. Most of them cannot hope back into this world. Looking for a job is hard, and a lot of previous military members get angry in this new world. It seems strange since you lived 18 years in the civilian world before joining, but it is. My father has to keep busy. Ronald and my father do not know how to interact with people. It all takes time. Giving Josh a left leg amputation allows him to easily drive. Ronald has his right leg amputated, and he drives with his left foot. Can you imagine the awkwardness of driving with your left foot? You cannot drive with your prosthetic, because you cannot feel pressure. The other option he could of had was using his steering wheel to apply the gas and brake for him.Other problems is maintenance for his leg, how he takes a shower, cysts, general pain in the socket, rashes, or falling on his nub. I know Skylar touched his nub, and I have to say it was weird the first few times I have touched it, but it is an ultra sensitive spot, and that wasn't mentioned. The nerve endings are right there at the bottom. Ronald has a scar at the bottom that remind me of Joker's smile. lol. I am assuming Josh had a skin graft done, and that leaves a mark on the skin. I know, the author couldn't get up close and personal to a nub, unless she is dating someone who has an amputation, because it is an intimate part of their bodies. You just don't go waving it around and I can understand that Josh was shy or ashamed about exposing it to the world. Ronald use to wear pants all the time. Now, he wears shorts and doesn't care. You really have to accept your body image, and learn to love your new self. Have to learn to say \"FUCK YOU, and I don't care what you think.\"The story as a whole I thought was cute. Skylar and Josh's relationship was cute. It brought up some memories of Ronald and I, good and bad. I think sometimes everyone needs that rock to help you stand up straighter, even if it was a friend or falling in love with someone. I like to think I helped Ronald get his shit together, and maybe I did. Sometimes I think he would of gotten everything together with or without me. He would of been a mountain man with his nasty beard living in Alaska. People change for other people or for themselves. Sometimes a friendship gives that extra shove they needed; to live for or motivation to live their lives at the best they could. Ronald stopped drinking because of our daughter. Josh changed for his friend Nick. Skylar helped Josh find his motivation to live, and to give him that spark he needed to stop dreaming of the past, and look to the future. Whatever it takes.

An inspiring, heartbreaking, uplifting, incredible triumph of the human soul and its capacity for perseverance and for love. I had little doubt I would connect to it, considering I gave her debut Something Real a rare 5 stars, but the absolute perfection of it still takes my breath away. No, it's not an easy book to swallow, and at times it's gut-wrenching, yet it's one of the most hopeful I've ever read. Reminds me of The Sea of Tranquility by Katja Millay. Gorgeous writing, captivating characters, and a powerful story that lingers, with an ending you want to hug. I haven't been able to forget about I'll Meet You There or its characters months after finishing it. I doubt I ever will. I think it goes without saying that this book wrecked me. I can't even imagine how Heather felt while writing it, because reading it had my heart beating erratically and had my chest aching with heaviness. Oh, and there were the tears coming out of my eyes, too. I cared so much about Skylar and Josh that I probably would have quit reading for good if they didn't get an ending they deserved. Theirs is a pretty simple story, one about a damaged boy and passionate girl who come unexpectedly together and find love and healing. Josh was once a cocksure boy, very attractive but not someone Skylar would have ever imagined herself with. His ticket out of their small, dead-end town, Creek View, was to join the Marines, but he returns home physically and psychologically damaged. He is but a shell of his former self. Skylar, three months away from art school and freedom, sees something more in Josh and decides to take him under her wing. She doesn't like the lost look in his eyes. A friendship unfurls between them, which leads to trust, tenderness, and eventually love. It's one of the most beautiful - and believable - romances I've ever read. One of the things that Heather does so well is her characters' voices. They are distinct and completely raw in their own way, and they made me fall for Skylar and Josh instantly. Skylar's chapters dominate the narrative. She is an immensely likable protagonist - strong-willed, artistic, and loyal. She has strong friendships in this book (thank you, Heather, for your lovely supporting cast), and she's a girl who doesn't shy away from what she wants. I love the fact that she supports Josh through everything. She is there for him in a way no one else is and never gives up on him. He doesn't always make it easy, but she knows he's worth it. Josh's chapters are more sporadic and much shorter, and they highlight just how lost he feels. There's guilt, self-revulsion, and helplessness, and boy did I just want to give him the biggest hug ever. His character growth is a heartbreaking but wonderful thing to witness, as he slowly lets Skylar in and becomes the man she deserves. I wasn't sure if Heather could ever top Patrick in my eyes, but Josh... just Josh. There are plenty of moving scenes between him and Skylar, but also some very sexy ones. I'm a fan of these mature YA books, that's for sure. Together Josh and Skylar find a new, powerful meaning to their lives, and they form a connection that is truly unbreakable. My review could never do this book justice. I haven't even touched on the smaller details of the plot, but I hope it's enough to convince even one reader to pick it up. Because this is not a book to be missed. I still remember the feeling I had when I finished it, and I want everyone to experience that same soul-stirring rush of emotion. Heather, I hope you give us books like this for the rest of days. ***Thanks to the publisher for the advanced copy in exchange for my honest review!***This review can also be found at Love at First Page."}, {"userName": "Kathe L", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25921490-kathe-l", "userReview": "\"Up there, I could see how Creek View had finally taken its proper place within the geography of us. It wasn't quicksand or an insurmountable mountain, and it wasn't Afghanistan, with its poppy fields and bombs. It was just a place - a part of me, a part of Josh, yes, but not big enough to define us. Not small enough to forget about. Together, it would be easy to map out new territory. A little bit closer to the stars, anything seemed possible.\"You know those books you finish and you realize you're speechless? Once you started reading the book, you forget everything around you. You start reading it at the bus and 40 minutes pass, but for you, it was only 5. Now I understand why Chelsea told me she was still thinking about this book, even after days have passed. (And thanks, sweet and lovely Chelsea for recommending this to me, you couldn't have recommended a better book for me if you had read my mind.) There are these books that speak to you because you've been through a situation just like the one described in the book, other times, it happened to someone close to you and you feel the same. Then, there are some books that you go in completely blind and they rock your world, because they speak of things you're going through right now. Like this one. I didn't go to the war, I didn't have a child as a teenager, but I could relate so much to Sky. Everything. It's seeing a character pass through so many tough situations that make you think: I can do this. It's having a character become a role model to you, even if he/she isn't real, even if everything works out at the end. I used to have this literate teacher that would say that books are the best medicine. That why, how and when you read a certain kind of book, in whichever situation you are, can make the difference between loving a book and hating it. And I definitely fit in the first category: of loving this book. \"Maybe people are like collages - no matter how broken or useless we felt, we were an essential part of the whole. We mattered.\"I am not going to talk much about the story. We have Josh, that came back from the war. Broken. We have Sky,, that is stuck in this city she can't wait for the time to go out of. She has her twin friend, Chris, who also wants to go out and Dylan,  Sky's best friend that has a child already. This story circulates more around Josh and Sky, that have their own POV's. Still, every bit of character adds something to this. We also have Marge, an old lady who owns the motel where Sky works at. I can't even tell you how Marge is important. We have about 10% of romance, and it keeps growing along the story. Love kind of isn't the main point. At least, it wasn't just because of that that I fell in love with this book. It talks about several things, including who we are and what we want to become. Our relationships with our families, financial situations, drinking, accidents, love, friends, death. How we deal after tough situations. If either we let ourselves absorb in depression or try to hold on to sanity as long as we can. Trying to figure out who we are after high school, without the people we have know for our whole lives. Dealing with family, people we love but that can be very hard to deal with. Falling in love without predicting it, with the hardest of people. All in all, this book is real.\"I had to tell him we were like a collage. Pieces that could be put back together in a new way, a better way.\" Josh: How dare you enter my heart this way? All unexpected and full of everything? Josh's POV's are like, one page. Three was the record, I think. Still, they left me speechless. Surprised, amazed, hooked. The writer wrote his POV just like she thought his mind worked, with hurried thoughts and conflicted emotions of love, sadness, fear, confusion. He just came back from the war, with everything on his mind of what happened there, minus a leg. He is just so... He has a brilliant humor, a soft heart full of caring for two specific people, and still, he has tons of problems. They make him human, though. At first, I couldn't believe the Josh with all his jumbled thoughts was the same Josh that talked to people everyday. Makes us think of how many things one can hide in himself/herself, you know? Sky: Jezz, girl. You were perfect to me. I could have hugged you thousands of times. It's relating to a character, it's wanting to be on her mind forever and give her advice. It's suffering alongside her. And yeah, I saw in some reviews people disagreeing with some of her actions. (cough cough in the creek). But I loved that part. Maybe one of my favorites, as twisted as it is. It was like seeing the \"dark\" side of someone. I was so happy for her, because it was as if she was finally saying all the things she had been keeping inside of her. And guess what, none of us are perfect. We make stupid things all the time, but that helps us learn. And if that hadn't happened, I don't think Sky would have done what she did after. Still, her good things were so good. She is so full of kindness in her heart. You may have realized I'm a sucker for people who are 'good', but that's just who I am. Yes, I love a character who stands by her mom even when everything falls down. I love a character who would do anything for the people she loves. And I love being able to connect: maybe I loved her as much as I did because I saw something of myself in the way she dealt with tough situations, the need to explode, wanting to try new things and loving her friends. Josh- How's the Sky today?Sky- Cloudy. I loved when he asked her that with all my heart.As you realized, this book is just way more. It brings everyday life's situations in a brilliant way. AND THE AUTHOR'S ACKNOWLEDGMENTS. Just... no words for that. I may know nothing about post-traumatic experiences, but this book, if given to people who have passed for that, would be brilliant. Would change their minds. You may think I'm overreacting over this book, but those of you know that I almost an all or nothing type of person. Or I give all of myself to a book, or I don't. I may step out of it disappointed when they are not good, but risking everything for books like this one makes it all worth it. I wish I could unread it just to start all over again. I was deeply touched and now I am emotionally exhausted. Finding another book as good as this one will be extremely hard, and I recommend this A LOT.

I have to say her Review was spot on. Some books are just fun and light, some stay with us after we read them, some terrify us, some touch us, some we can relate to, some take us to far away places and some contain magic.This book, although not magical in nature, transported me from Los Angeles to a small town in California. I felt I was living there with them. This book - well I could relate to some of it. This book was touching, I admit, I read it way too fast because I did not want to put it down and darn it, I hated when it ended.This book is a wonderfully written book about 2 young people dealing with their own issues growing up in a small town. This is a book I could relate to. I could relate to the female character of Skylar. Like her, I grew up in a small town where you were either related to everyone in town or you knew them(and they knew everything about you). Where college was a dream, an escape, the only way to get out of Dodge and do something with your life. Boy could I relate to that.The other main character is Josh. A hometown boy who comes back from serving as a Marine after suffering a wound in battle that left him an amputee.I loved how the Author told the story from both their points of view. I thought she did a good job, helping us relate to each character. They are flawed - but there is beauty in imperfections. No one is perfect in this book and that is the beauty of it. The Characters feel real. They do real things, they make mistakes and gosh darn it, I rooted for them the entire time.See more of my reviews at www.openbookpost.com"}, {"userName": "Jennifer Kyle", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9916227-jennifer-kyle", "userReview": "3.75 Stars * REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*\n\u201dWith Josh, it felt inevitable.

All the supporting characters were really well done but the above incident was SO NOT NEEDED especially at so late in the story (I mean if the author was held by gun point and had to put this scene in she should have thrown it in earlier\u2026 I guess).

Lots of emotion, introspection, and growing up. At times I found myself talking back to the book, urging characters to take certain actions, etc. Anytime I am invested enough to talk to a book it is a sign that it is probably good.This book will have extra interest for those from military families. There is a lot in here about how war affects and changes people. Based on the afterward, it sounds like this is something the author has taken very seriously.It is a teenage love story, but so much more.

Well, that\u2019s the boat I find myself in with this one. I was late to the Heather Demetrios party with Something Real \u2026 and I was positive after reading it that I would never be late to her amazing words again, and when I had the opportunity to grab this one I did so immediately and I\u2019m pretty sure this is going to be among my top reads of the year.Skylar Evans lives in a dead end of a town, and she\u2019s counting down the days until she can get out. All she has to do is graduate and make sure her mom has her act together. That last part isn\u2019t going to be so easy and it\u2019s further complicated when her mom loses her job and starts hanging with someone she doesn\u2019t trust.Josh Mitchell thought he had his ticket out of Creek View\u2026 The Marines. But when he loses a leg in Afghanistan and he\u2019s forced to return home, his life is certainly nothing like the one he had when he left. He absolutely doesn\u2019t expect to connect with Skylar\u2026 but they find friendship in each other and eventually something even more. \n\u201cSky,\u201d he whispered. My name in his mouth sounded like a warning, but he wasn\u2019t letting go, was gripping me harder, and after all these weeks of anxious hope, it was suddenly so easy to just turn my body a few degrees and press my lips against his.\nUGH you guys\u2026. These characters that Demetrios has crafted are amazing. They are so layered and complex and relatable and they make you feel things you don\u2019t want to feel and despite the heavy feel of this story, I couldn\u2019t help but feel so filled with hope when I turned the last page. This story has a lot of ups and downs\u2026 the struggles that Josh faces every single day, the things he used to take for granted and his despondency about where his life can go from here was hard to read. But it was also amazing to see him push himself, to not want to give up, to realize that there is more out there for him. And Skylar and Josh together were just perfection. Don\u2019t get that statement wrong. Their friendship is by no means easy\u2026 and there was this one time that my heart split in two, but everything that happened felt real and raw and sad\u2026 yet beautiful. There was one quote in this book that I highlighted because it was lovely and I didn\u2019t really realize the significance of it until rereading my notes\u2026\n\u201cI loved taking these pieces and making them part of a whole, giving them a place to belong. More beautiful than when they started.\u201d\nThis couldn\u2019t have summed up this story for me any better. Demetrios has taken these characters\u2026 the pieces of the story and made them whole, she\u2019s given them a place to belong and it\u2019s true \u2026 while they started out beautifully, they are even better when you get to that last page.If you\u2019re looking for a poignant, touching story of fresh starts and new beginnings a story of finding the people you can call family, even if they aren\u2019t exactly your original family. If you are looking for an unexpected romance and characters who will grab hold of you and have you thinking about them even after you\u2019ve closed the book then this is definitely for you.

Like really good. Like I want to read it again. Like what is life. Review to be posted when (if) I come down from this state of bliss.Read the full review @ A Perfection Called BooksWhy do I judge books before I read them? It kills me that I do this. I need to stop. Starting this book was done begrudgingly as it's a contemporary with a somewhat \"rough\" aspect to it. I thought this book would be dreadfully sad and in your face about the tragic stuff. I was woefully mistaken. This book was absolutely amazing, had a spectacular romance, a great message, and is a definite new favorite of mine.Skylar and Josh were two amazing characters. Skylar was so brave, responsible, funny, determined, and just full-on wonderful. I wanted to hug Josh so many times in this book. He was so broken from the war and his accident, yet he managed to stay positive and happy. He's genuinely a good guy, and I loved how caring and thoughtful he was. They truly helped each other grow into stronger people. The other characters were funny and just as memorable. All of their stories and the characters themselves were fleshed-out and relatable. The romance was beautiful. It developed oh so slowly, it was a snowball effect. Their banter had me grinning from ear to ear. I devoured this book. I needed to see them finally become a couple. It was all done in such good timing and in such a sweet and genuine fashion. I swooned countless times, I teared up, I \"awwwed.\" I don't know who wanted them to get together more, me or them... I SHIPPED THEM SO HARD.The message that Heather sends is genuinely so heartfelt. She shared what military life is like to us readers who don't know much about it. She brought awareness to the shocking truth as to how these brave people who fight for our country come back with PTSD and nightmares and physical and mental wounds. She made us think a little harder about things that normally don't cross our minds. The writing was so pretty as well. I was constantly happily surprised by the vivid imagery and the beautiful sentences and words she strung together. I'm glad to add Heather to my list of favorite authors.This book was just so well done. This needs to be on your to-read and to-buy lists. Truly spectacular. I could read it again.
