The quality of the writing deteriorated during the last two seasons but overall I was a fan. So it was enjoyable to read the books that the show was based on. I can see why the chose to tone down the \u201cHillbilly\u201d attributes so it wouldn\u2019t be a repeat of the Real McCoys. I recommend the books to anyone who enjoyed the TV show."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth Hunt", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62991289-elizabeth-hunt", "userReview": "Like Coming HomeI grew up watching the Walton's and, when I discovered thus book a few days ago, I was delighted.

You should read Homecomeing first or it\u2019s not interesting.

More a series of vignettes, than a novel.
