Thankfully for The Provence Cure for the Brokenhearted, this novel was everything that Eat, Pray, Love wasn't. It had characters that I cared about and a plot that actually moved. By the end of the book I wasn't happy it was over; I was sad there weren't more pages to read.Two years after her husbands tragic death, Heidi is still struggling to come to terms with it. Then, when her family's home in southern France is damaged in a kitchen fire, her mother convinces her to take her young son and jaded-with-life niece to France to begin repairs and renovations. There Heidi will learn more about herself and her relationship with her deceased husband, her son will grow, and her niece will harbor a life-changing secret that will bring the family together in a way they've never been together before.Heidi's character was not selfish. It would only be natural for her to take on a sense of \"woe is me\" because her husband was gone, but she was also focused on her son, whom she loved with all her heart. The characters in this novel are real, believable and deep. The scenery is gorgeous and themes throughout the novel are woven together. It was complex and beautiful.Note: Despite the fact that I won a free copy of this novel, that fact didn't influence my review in anyway. I genuinely loved this novel"}, {"userName": "Jodi", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/667420-jodi", "userReview": "I know this book has gotten a lot of good reviews but it bordered on drivel. Part of that is because while I am the first to say that recovering from grief takes as long as it takes, you have to have some desire to stop wallowing in it, bathing it in, reveling in and defining yourself by it. And that's what Heidi does. Her husband was killed in a freak accident 2 years earlier. Her business (a pastry shop) is alive only because of her business partner. Her son has become extremely neurotic. And she just doesn't give a damn. Her mother convinces to go to Provence with her son and her step-niece to renovate the old family house. There, despite herself, she find love again. But it isn't a romance. Nor is it a food memory story, though the author tried to make it so. But Heidi was so weak, so dislikable. I pitied her son and I did blame her for much of what happened as she chose to sleepwalk through life. I understood that she had a perfect marriage or at least a perfect love but celebrate that you had it, because most people never get that much. It was very well read which is why I kept listening."}, {"userName": "Zoe", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2285152-zoe", "userReview": "This book touched me in a deep and personal way. I have seen countless portrayals of love; most are simplistic. All of Bridget Asher's books manage to capture this elusive concept in staggering detail and complexity. With each passing book her storytelling skills increase and she is able to reach ever higher levels of truth. In addition to love, her books give equal attention to loss and grief. Most, if not all, of this complexity comes from the melding, blending, and transforming power of these two emotions. The Provence Cure for the Brokenhearted focuses more than ever on the latter emotion. What I found most striking was the transcendent nature of the characters' grief. While there have been countless portrayals of love, I have never found such a true story of mourning. There were several instances of (I'm sorry I can't come up with a better word) truth. Here is but one example:\"I was painfully aware how selfish my grief was. My eight-year-old son had lost his father. Henry's parents had lost their son. And Henry had lost his life. What right did I have to use Henry's death as an excuse--time and again-- to check out?\"The Provence Cure for the Brokenhearted may be propelled by death-- both literal and figurative-- but it manages to have light moments, too. How could it not? Life is full of both, and this book is such a wonderful homage to just that. If I had one critique, it would be that there is the slightest tinge of corniness, or cheesiness, or hokiness, or whatever you want to call it, concerning the house in France. Chalk it up to my lack of faith in mysticism, but the repeated \"miracles\" were hard to swallow. As they were minor enough in the scheme of things, it is easy to let slide, especially in the onslaught of emotional resonance. (Does that even make sense? I'm having a hard time conveying this idea.) It can, perhaps, be best summed up with this:\"Every good love story has another love hiding within it.\"and...\"Grief is a love story told backward just as love is a grief story told backward.\"I highly recommend this book to pretty much anyone. We're talking about pretty universal stuff, after all."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1948865-sara", "userReview": "This book did not begin until page 130. Yes, that is right, you have to wade through that many pages for the story to really get its start, to become interesting. The first hundred pages deal with the depth of grief a widow has over her deceased husband and how every moment is consumed with thoughts of him and protecting their young child. The grief was overwhelming and strong and had me thinking that this was not the book that I wanted it to be. Finally, after page 100 or so our widow and her son will travel to the family house in Provence. FINALLY! If you have lasted this long it the book, this is where the story gets better. Immersed in a new country with a new language and foreign shops and people, the widow and her son start to breathe again. The dead husband is no longer all-consuming. In fact the widow starts to taste food again for the first time in two years. Soon the widow meets up with Julian, once the little boy who sat across from her when she was a child, now a grown man who shows them the town and adventures.

Esattamente come la protagonista, che finalmente si risveglia dal torpore della sua vita e inizia a superare gli avvenimenti di due anni prima e ad innamorarsi di Julian.Nel complesso, in realt\u00e0, \u00e8 tutto molto prevedibile.Per quel che riguarda i personaggi, devo dire che alcuni mi sono piaciuti molto, altri decisamente no.Tra i no, al primo posto spicca la protagonista: sua mi \u00e8 piaciuta la crescita che subisce il personaggio, la sua capacit\u00e0, alla fine, di ricominciare ad amare. Per\u00f2 per tutto il tempo sembra quasi che non lo voglia fare e questa sua modifica avviene praticamente in un battito di ciglia e nemmeno te ne accorgi. Inoltre l\u2019ho trovata abbastanza piatta e noiosa.Negativo anche Julian, che per un sacco di pagine potrebbe benissimo essere sostituito con un manichino. Non viene mai descritto come vera e propria persona, solo come ci\u00f2 di cui Heidi ha bisogno in quel momento.E allora vi chiederete: Che personaggi mi sono piaciuti? La risposta \u00e8 tutti quelli secondar. In primis vi \u00e8 Charlotte, che ho trovato un personaggio molto forte per la sua et\u00e0, con la testa sulle spalle. E poi Abbot, che mi ha fatto molta tenerezza. Anche Abbot subisce un\u2019evoluzione importante e devo dire che anche questa \u00e8 stata un po\u2019 affrettata, ma al contrario rispetto a sua madre: al posto di avvenire completamente alla fine del romanzo, avviene appena arrivano in Provenza.La cosa migliore del libro, per\u00f2, \u00e8 rappresentata da tutte le storie sulla casa e sull\u2019amore: mi hanno molto affascinato e credo che siano state queste a farmi continuare, e finire, la lettura.Nel complesso il libro risulta per\u00f2 molto mediocre e scontato.

Now that I'm done reading it, I would give it more like 3.25 stars.The plot is known: Heidi Buckley is still mourning the death of her husband who passed away in a car accident the year before. Heidi's 8 year old son Abbott, has become obsessive compulsive as a way to manage his own grief. Heidi's mom is heartbroken that the family summer home in the south of France (isn't that where your summer home is located?) has been damaged due to a fire. The house is the backdrop to centuries of love stories and apparently has the power to heal a broken heart. Heidi's mom dispatches Heidi, Abbott and Charlotte, the sarcastic stepdaughter of Heidi's sister, to go to France to repair the house and take in some of its healing powers to boot. I struggled in some critical places with this book. One, Heidi was a scatter-brained sap who I didn't feel like was grieving her husband Henry, so much as wishing he were there to do the hard stuff in life for her. He's presented as the one who kept the trains running on time in their lives and not a partner and being of his own. What was missing was sorrow. Heidi presented him as the one who'd find your lost car keys. Two, this windswept love they supposedly shared felt immature and childish. Bridget's writing felt like how you'd write about love if you were 16 and not in your late 30s as these characters were. It wasn't the love of a lifetime. It didn't have that deepness and richness you'd expect from people that really love and support each other have. It was in fact surprisingly vapid.Third, whole bits of life are just forgotten about. Heidi has a business called Cake Shop that apparently the indentured servant manages while Heidi is mourning her dead husband in France. Money also doesn't appear to be a problem either as when a robbery takes place and all their belongings are stolen, Heidi goes to the French equivalent of Wal-Mart and replaces pretty much everything. That on top of the money to renovate this healing summer home seems to just flow from unknown sources. The book picks up significantly once the brood arrives at the French house. Other characters are revealed namely Veronique, who is sort of the Morgan Freeman of French love and romance for this story. Veronique is something of a caretaker for the house and one of Heidi's mom's oldest friends. Certain secrets are revealed, the obligatory panic is interjected (\"Oh no, Abbott is missing!\") and resolved, new love blossoms and the ending tidies up as expected. Something about the narration of the book threw me off. It's in first person but probably should have been in third. The pacing didn't match how a person thinks in real time and while some of the musings were thoughtful and worth shoring up in the back of your own mind, there were definite shades of Lifetime movies past, present and future in these thoughts, feelings and observations. The most interesting character was Charlotte as she showed the most wisdom and insight of the whole bunch. Then again, I always find self-possession and grace in teenagers to be interesting. I might read another book by this author and while this one is not a beach read per se, it qualifies as a rainy day read."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2232612-lisa", "userReview": "This is a good ole easy read which is good for a sunny day (or cloudy as we have in the Pacific Northwest) when you need to feel some love!!

It was capable of performing miracles.\"I have to say first of all that even though this book was well written it was actually even more depressing initially than I expected from the title! I wasn't expecting a wholly happy story, obviously- but this book was a bit of a slog to get through from the go and I did wonder if I should continue to persevere with it. I was having a fairly happy Friday- until I opened this!Joking aside, it does get off to a bit of a slow start and for me doesn't get going until about a quarter of the way through- so be prepared for that. The book centres on Heidi, a pastry chef who is still struggling with her grief two years after the death of her husband, Henry. Bringing up their young son on her own, she still seems to be in a fog, and its her well-meaning (interfering) sister and mother who suggest that she take some time out at the long-abandoned family home in Provence for a `lost summer' and a way of getting back a bit of herself. Heidi heads to France with her son and her niece and whilst there learns about love, loss and most importantly- healing.Though I've probably made that sound a bit like this is a self-help book, it was inferred to be more of a foodie-type romance which is why I bought it. I have to agree with the other reviewer that the romance is a bit lacking though and seems a bit rushed- although the descriptions of Provence itself are beautiful and you can imagine yourself being there. I think though for me, I was never fully engaged with this book the way I'd hoped to be as I couldn't really get into Heidi's head. I think that's because the start of the book was so angst-ridden and emotional that it was a bit bogged down in detail and you learned more about Henry than about her and she retains a real sense of distance from the reader (perhaps she was intentionally written this way?). Situations were depicted very well but perhaps in an overly wordy, sentimental manner and she always seemed to be reflecting on encounters with Henry through flashbacks. I feel that the author `tells' you rather than `shows' you certain things which doesn't always work for me.Nevertheless, Heidi's determination to keep Henry's memory alive for her son is admirable and lies at the heart of this novel. Poor little Abbot has been deeply affected by his father's death and along with a fear of people leaving him and him constantly worrying, he also has OCD. Abbot is depicted very well. The strongest character of all though is probably teenage niece Charlotte who is again angst ridden but at least knows her own mind. I didn't like Heidi's bossy, interfering sister particularly and her brother-in-law didn't make much of an impression on me either.The underlying premise of this novel is that It teaches you not to take things for granted and embrace life a bit more- you never really know what you have until it's gone. It's a story of a lost summer, family secrets and of people learning to heal after a loss. It's not the happiest novel in the world admittedly, but I actually enjoyed it though I did feel a bit sad by some of the content towards the beginning-- but I'm still glad I persevered.Recommended if you enjoy women's contemporary fiction- as I type this it's a bargain price on Kindle so would make a good holiday read! If you enjoy this then I can also highly recommend: \"Sophie's Bakery for the Broken-hearted\" which has a very similar premise- though much more descriptions of food in it."}, {"userName": "Ricki Treleaven", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3749793-ricki-treleaven", "userReview": "This week I read The Provence Cure for the Brokenhearted by Bridget Asher. I know many of you have emailed me about this book, wondering when I was going to read it. I finally got around to it, and I love it.I want to warn you that if you have been grieving lately, the first 124 pages of the book might be a bit too intense because Heidi, the main character, is grieving over the death of her husband who died two years previously. They truly had a great marriage and loved each other very much. Some of the details about the marriage I find heartbreaking. I literally cried during a couple of passages because Heidi's memories of her late husband and her grief was too much for me. Making life even more difficult for Heidi is that her sister, Elysius, is about to be married, and Heidi is a bridesmaid. She is also worried for her seven-year-old son, Abbot. Abbot has been exhibiting signs of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder: he is obsessed with germs, washing his hands, and hand sanitizer. Heidi has also allowed her grief to hinder her creativity as she has not created a single cake at her business, the Cake Shop. Heidi and her husband Henry started the Cake Shop together. They both shared a love for cooking and pastries, and they even met in a kitchen. Amazingly, a family secret is the key ingredient that eventually led to Heidi's meeting Henry.After Elysius's wedding, Heidi's French mother decides that Heidi should visit the family home in Puyloubier, Provence. The house needs work especially in the recently fire-damaged kitchen. Heidi decides that it will not hurt her to have a \"lost summer\" like her mother did when Heidi was thirteen. So she packs her bags and takes Abbot and her niece, Charlotte, to France. While there, Heidi regains her senses and feels alive again. She becomes interested in her creative outlet (baking), and throws lots of energy into renovating the neglected family home. She reconnects with the neighbors she knew as a child, and family secrets are revealed as Heidi and Abbot both heal.I love the setting for this book. Heidi's family home has a history, and most of the stories tend to be romantic ones. Marriages have been proposed, babies conceived, and love has flourished under its roof. It seems that the house likes attention, and it fosters romantic feelings and desires in its inhabitants. I adore books where the family homes are really characters rather than mere settings. I also enjoy books with a homecoming theme, so the whole idea that returning to the home of one's heart can truly heal heartbreak appeals to me.A glorious setting in Provence, struggling characters the reader roots for, a house that comes with its own set of lore, and a budding love story kept me reading late into the night. What more could I possibly ask for in a summer reading book? The Provence Cure for the Brokenhearted will definitely cure your Summer Reading List blues."}, {"userName": "Stefi Il Giardino delle rose", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8796639-stefi-il-giardino-delle-rose", "userReview": "Dopo la morte di Henry, la vita di Heidi sembrava non avere pi\u00f9 senso, il suo futuro ormai spento, i suoi pensieri erano sempre altrove, aveva iniziato a perdere le cose, a perdere gli amici ed il tempo era scivolato su di lei, la vita procedeva di gran carriera, ma lei non ne faceva parte.

While reading this book I allowed myself to wallow in sef-pity for the exquisite and sharp pain of being abandoned and left with two children to raise, alone. To remember the hurt that they felt, that they still feel of being abandoned too. I've had that argument in my own mind, the one with Heidi and Julien (I love that name...a memory from my 19-year old self buying a Julien Clerc record on the Champs Elysees!), arguing over who feels the most misery: someone who loses a spouse to abandonment or to death. In my scenario death is easier. It's final. There are no loose ends in death. There were real people in my argument that I could point to and say, \"See, it's easier for them.\" Now I can see that everyone has heartache, in all its varied forms. It feels right that Julianna chose to let the hungry people in Africa win the argument. Thankfully, the pain is a distant memory, one where the argument doesn't matter anymore. Like the book, our lives can have happy endings too. Someone else with sparkling eyes can make us forget (not forget, but overlook) the sad past and love again. This book evokes many happy memories for me: visiting small inns like Veronique's in Italy and France. Paris. Thinking partly in French and partly in English. Searching for the right French word and not getting it quite right. The little chapel on the mountain. Renting cars. Driving rented cars on tiny dirt roads in the countryside, sucking in my stomach with my eyes shut as the cars whistle past. The smell of the earth. The mountains of France. The food. Delicious, different food. Pastry shops with divine litte confections.I love that this book has a happy ending. So many books that I've read in the last few years are tragic with tragic endings.

Heidi's seven-year-old son, Abbott, also has never stopped missing his father and has become an obsessive-compulsive over germs. Heidi\u2019s sister and mother think that enough is enough and that it really is time for Heidi to start to live again. There is a house in Provence that has been in the family for generations, nowadays it is let out as a holiday rental, but a recent fire has Heidi\u2019s mother send her to France to organise repairs and generally upgrade the house. Heidi\u2019s mother believes that the house will help Heidi move on as it has long been believed that it is a living, breathing force that brings about miracles; especially miracles that involve the heart.Heidi arrives in France with her son and sixteen year old step-niece Charlotte. Heidi\u2019s sister added the brooding teen to the trip, as she is newly married to Charlotte\u2019s father and they would like time alone. Their arrival starts with another loss, this time the hire car is broken into and all their stuff is taken. In spite of the discouraging start, Heidi, Abbot and Charlotte gradually start to put their lives back together again as the house works its magic on the three broken people sleeping within its walls.Despite the fact deep mourning is central to Heidi\u2019s character; THE PROVENCE CURE FOR THE BROKENHEARTED is not in the slightest bit depressing. Heidi is strong willed, and perfectly happy to spend the rest of her life mourning Henry and fights her feelings tooth and nail as she gradually learns she can always love Henry, but must start living again. I stayed up late into the night to finish this one, as each wounded character came to terms with what they needed to do. THE PROVENCE CURE FOR THE BROKENHEARTED is not really a romance, although there is some romance for some of the characters; what it is though is a book about new beginnings and learning to live again."}, {"userName": "Regina Spiker", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4274600-regina-spiker", "userReview": "A lovely little book that tugs on your heartstrings and pulls you into the characters and setting...A young widow, Heidi, with a son, Abbott, can not move forward after her husband's tragic car accident. Her mother and sister thrust her into as what they describe as a \"needed lost summer\" at their homeplace in Provence, France in hopes that the magical stone house and countryside will bring her back to life. Heidi also takes her niece, misunderstood 16 year old Charlotte, along with her. The lovely mountains and fresh air surround the threesome with peace and a childhood friend of Heidi's arrives, bringing with him a restlessness for more than just friendship. But, when Abbott disappears and fear returns, Heidi is ready to go back to the US and the continued life of mourning.I love the characters and the depth of their emotions. Abbott is a smart, sweet character with obsessive compulsive tendencies, that have appeared after his father's death. Heidi is very patient and loving in dealing with this, knowing that Abbott is part of her beloved husband. You feel for Heidi as she tries to paste on a smile and act normal around her friends and family. Don't think this book is all about sadness, because there is a lot of laughter thrown in and romance that lightens up the heavy sadness that permeates the first part of the novel."}, {"userName": "Christie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/856528-christie", "userReview": "If you can read this book and not be full of longing for Provence then there is something terribly the matter with you! I savored every minute of this book. I allowed the ideas to soak into my heart and I really feel blessed to have been able to read it. The characters are delightful, unpredictable and beautiful. I truly felt like I was being taught how to write as I read. A wise author, Julianna Baggot, :), once told me that to create beautiful writing you have to blend the good with the bad; mix the terrible with the wonderful; the failure with the triumph. You must have darkness. Oh how this book illustrates her point. One of my favorite authors, Khalil Gibran, says that \"Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.\" This was a constant theme throughout this book. I believe with my whole heart that we can only know joy as deep as we have known the pain. And the whimsy? It's there in little paper lanterns and french pastries and characters that make you want to reach through the pages and hug them.Are you brokenhearted...in any way? This book is, most certainly, your cure."}, {"userName": "Elphaba J", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7355865-elphaba-j", "userReview": "Um amor eterno foi perdido, abruptamente, antes do tempo sem que jamais possa ser recuperado e aus\u00eancia, oca, cumpre-se atrav\u00e9s de uma saudade que jamais se desvanecer\u00e1.Num local sublime, uma mulher perdida, ter\u00e1 de reflectir sobre o passado e encontrar na vida a magia necess\u00e1ria para cumprir o seu futuro.Proven\u00e7a O Lugar M\u00e1gico Onde se Curam Cora\u00e7\u00f5es Partidos \u00e9 um livro que se encontra dividido em duas partes destintas.

Heidi's family home in Provence, France has always had the power to do just that. Heidi's mother escaped there one summer after a heartbreak and came back whole. Heidi's sister escaped to Provence with her boyfriend and came back engaged. When Heidi finds herself in Provence with her son and niece, she isn't so sure that the house will work its magic on her.Bridget Asher captured a wonderful character in Heidi's voice. I could relate to her in so many ways. I enjoyed her way of flashbacking to her life with Henry. It was such a natural part of her voice and narrative. And, I adored Charlotte. The setting is magical. The descriptions are lyrical. Family secrets, broken hearts, friendship, food and laughter make this a fantastic story."}, {"userName": "BJ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4690460-bj", "userReview": "The Provence Cure for the Brokenhearted\" by Bridget Asher was a book I really enjoyed. Most of the book is set in Provence, France which I loved. The main character, Heidi, owns a bakery called The Cake Shop. After her husband dies in an unexpected accident, her mother convinces her to take her young son and her sister's step-daughter to a house that her mother owns in Provence to oversee some remodelling. The house has a personality of it's own and Heidi has grown up with stories of love made right by being at this house. This is a story of food, friendship, family, healing and found love. Well written, lovely setting, great characters, recipes at the end. Everything I love in a book!"}, {"userName": "Diana", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26679971-diana", "userReview": "Had a dreamy-like quality in it. Lots of fantasy and superstition, things like: 'the house will speak to you', 'the house will decide for you' etc. A bit like an absent-minded and dreamy person, IMO. The main character is too obsessed by her love to her husband. The child is a bit weird, I don't think I've ever met a child like that in real life so I don't think a child like that exists. Had a bit of food element in it though not much. I don't feel the chemistry between the main character with the new love but I'm glad she got a happy ending anyway."}], "description": "\u201cEvery good love story has another love hiding within it.\u201d \u00a0 Brokenhearted and still mourning the loss of her husband, Heidi travels with Abbott, her obsessive-compulsive seven-year-old son, and Charlotte, her jaded sixteen-year-old niece, to the small village of Puyloubier in the south of France, where a crumbling stone house may be responsible for mending hearts since before World War II.There, Charlotte confesses a shocking secret, and Heidi learns the truth about her mother\u2019s \u201clost summer\u201d when Heidi was a child.
