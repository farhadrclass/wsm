For someone as socially inept as myself, my only defense is to hide in my car, which works great at practices, but tends to be frowned upon by my kids when it comes to the actual games and . . . you know my ability to see them play. It probably goes without saying to my fellow introverts that my anxiety level is a shit-ton teensy bit higher than usual this time of year. Imagine my delight when I was avoiding the baseball facility until the last moment possible took a few minutes to hit up a local bookstore and discovered the holy grail of all adult coloring books that will supposedly help reduce my stress . . . . \nThis might be the best thing that ever happened to me. It also confirmed that there\u2019s a good chance my family members are all part unicorn . . . \n\n\n(^^^^I have one thing to say to the people who I let live in my house with me when it comes to what I choose to listen to: YOU CAN GO AND LOVE YOURSELF!)"}, {"userName": "rhea", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2544157-rhea", "userReview": "You need to learn the truth... the cold, hard, sparkly truth.

I received this book as a bonus when I won the Zombie Mandala Coloring Book through Goodreads First Reads, and let me tell you, that was a thrilling surprise!I love this coloring book because it's also a story. Or maybe it's a story that's also a coloring book? Hmm....If you love unicorns and have a sense of humor, you'll love this book. Unicorns may look pretty and sparkly and nice, but they're really jerks. Everything from using all of your shampoo to stealing your french fries! And they can't even take a joke! Ugh. Unicorns are jerks. (And oh so fun to color!)My 9 year daughter keeps checking with me to see if I've colored another page and has already asked for her own copy for Christmas. :)"}, {"userName": "Ainsley", "userReviewDate": "Feb 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7508260-ainsley", "userReview": "One of those gifts that shows that someone gets me.

I can't remember the last time I did any coloring, but after reading about Theo Nicole Lorenz's coloring books on XOJane.com I just had to place an order. They arrived this week and today I really needed a break, so I sat myself down with a fresh box of crayons and had myself a good time. Unicorns Are Jerks is the newest of the two books and I will definitely buying another copy of this for my 13 year old niece's birthday next month. Originally I thought I'd get Fat Ladies In Spaaaaace for me & Unicorns Are Jerks for her, but when they arrived and I saw how witty, charming and packed with personality the illustrations are I changed my mind. This copy is mineallmine, and I'll get a second one for my niece :-) Today I colored in \"Unicorns eat your leftovers\"(an adorably sassy unicorn perched on top of the fridge mocking his roomie as he eats all her leftover noodles) and \"Unicorns judge you for your taste in music\" (disdainful unicorn sneering from behind his roomie's armchair as she rolls her eyes and enjoys streaming her tunes anyway) and I'm really looking forward to doing more. My only complaint is that I wish the cover image was included as a coloring page, but the 18 pictures that are included are wonderful and serve as a satirical guide to 21st Century etiquette besides. And although the focus of this book is on jerks-and-how-to-spot-them rather than size acceptance there are all all shapes and sizes represented here. It does my heart good to see bodies that look like mine represented in places like this!"}, {"userName": "Leah", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15279569-leah", "userReview": "People keep telling me I should try adult coloring, but the pretty mandalas and what-not don't really interest me so much. It's just as goofy as you would think from the title. In terms of age range I would say anyone from a pre-teen to an adult with a sense of humor. I don't know that I would want my young child coloring with it just because there is a smoking unicorn on the cover. But none of the jokes are truly inappropriate. Really, just look at the title \"Unicorns are Jerks,\" I think if this was truly adult humor it would be Unicorns are d*s or something harsher. It's just a funny little book about how unicorns aren't as great as everyone thinks they are."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9377580-james", "userReview": "With the growth of coloring books for a more adult crowd, we are blessed with this work for the sarcastic adult crowd.
