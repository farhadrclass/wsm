If you don't already know, I have a soft spot for imperfect characters as long as there are no TSTL moments. That said, if you insist on the most gorgeous heroine and the handsomest hero without angst, then be warned and stay far, far away from this author. ~Just a note: initially she wrote under the name Ruth Wind, then as Barbara Samuel and now she also publishes as Barbara O'Neal.~In A Piece of Heaven, Luna McGraw is an alcoholic. It had been over four years since she had her last drink but there was not a day that went by when she didn't think of it. She also gave up smoking recently because the daughter she lost custody of years ago was coming to live with her. She deeply wanted to be the best mom she could be; she knew she had to earn 15-year-old Joy's respect. Before her descent with liquor, she had been a therapist. Now she worked as a florist in a grocery store; color was important to her. 'Sunlight poked through the clouds here and there, falling like solid golden needles in some places, liquid as orange juice in others. She sometimes felt drunk on all that color, wanting to eat it, rub it all over herself, save it in jars and paint it on her clothes and ceilings.' Oh, how I just loved Ms. Samuel's verbalization!Thomas Coyote met Luna when she saved his grandmother from setting her house on fire. It was an accident. 'Placida Ramirez knew she did not have much time. There was old in her bones, not like it had been when she was sixty and her knees got stiff after a rain or when she was seventy-six and sometimes fell asleep in her chair, half-shucked corn still in her hands when she woke up.' Thomas and Luna had seen each other around town but up until the incident with his abuela, they hadn't spoken to each other. Thomas had his own share of baggage. He had been married and divorced twice but no children. In some ways, he still loved them both. But observe what I said: love and not in love, a big difference. He had a minor problem picking up strays: animals and people-in-need. His nose was striking, his skin was swarthy and he wore his dark hair in a long braid going down his back. As near as I can determine, he was 40-something. He was a big guy, \"as big as a bear\"; not handsome, but attractive in a manly-man kind of way. Each chapter began with a quote, a calendar of important dates, a legend or a tidbit of facts. It was a piece of information that tied the chapter's theme with the characters' thoughts; it pulled them together. Read it! The setting took place in Taos, New Mexico with its heavy Hispanic and Native American population and rich cultural history. It seemed every other person was an artist in some fashion trying to express their inner child.There was some family drama, grief, self-discovery and I-lost-but-now-I-found moments. The author tackled spirituality and faith with a couple different forms of religion but I never felt the plot was religious or inspirational. I thoroughly enjoyed this romance for what it was: \nA Piece of Heaven\n on earth."}, {"userName": "Melodie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5788507-melodie", "userReview": "This is a lovely read with a reminder of some life lessons. Set in New Mexico amid vibrant cultural sights,aromas and sounds, a woman struggles with her past mistakes and current struggles with trust and self esteem and forgiveness. Her mother,sister and daughter play large roles in her struggles. The female family dynamic was engaging along with interesting secondary characters.Truly a contemporary romance amid imperfect people."}, {"userName": "Margaret", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10549695-margaret", "userReview": "Luna McGraw was wounded as a child when her much-loved father left home one day and never returned. She and her younger sister were raised by a loving mother who struggled to provide the material things for her daughters--but the love she provided was deep and constant.An over-achiever, Luna wanted to leave her New Mexico hometown and not look back. She meets an ambitious young man in college, marries him after graduate school and finds herself living in Georgia where social-climbing is important to her husband's political aspirations. It is that social climbing that is Luna's downfall. Social drinking becomes more than social as she finds herself alone while her husband is frequently out of town. She is careful to never drink around her young daughter. The drinking usually comes late into the night when the darkness creeps into her soul. But Luna's husband is cunning and powerful. He finds out about her drinking, divorces her,and takes custody of their child.Luna returns to New Mexico close to her mother and her sister, but far enough away to wallow in her pain as she goes down a dangerous path until she finally hits rock bottom and accepts the help she needs.Four years sober, Luna's ex-husband has, for some mysterious reason, agreed that their 15 year old daughter can live with Luna and that is where the story actually begins as Luna is spending a sleepless night thinking about the precious chance to be a full-time mother to her precious daughter.The minute I began reading this book, I was transported from my Indiana home to what I imagine must be beautiful Taos, New Mexico. Samuel paints pictures with words. My senses were tickled with not just sights, though. My mouth watered and my nose twitched when she described traditional Mexican food.(I would have welcomed recipes!) My heart was touched by Luna's heartbreak and her unconditional love for her daughter. There are many characters in this story...Placida, the elderly neighborhood \"witch\" who conjures up charms...Placida's grandson, Thomas Coyote who is wounded but has an immediate connection with Luna...Luna's younger sister who hides from herself and her gift of singing...Luna's mother who has accepted the fact that she can love and be loved...Luna's own quirky daughter who has wisdom beyond her 15 years...the cast of characters goes on, and I loved each character, flaws and all. I hated to see this beautiful \"love story\" end. It wasn't just about male-female relationships, but about family and friends and the healing power that love has when one is patient enough to keep loving.I will be looking for more soul-soothing books from Ms. Samuel."}, {"userName": "Rossy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2512735-rossy", "userReview": "This was such a fantastic read! Loved each and every character, very realistic scenarios. Every now and then i stumble upon a book that not only touches me but is able to teach me something as well. This is certainly one of those that i will be thinking about for some time.Update:Six years later and this book taught me some lessons I had forgotten. Even if you're scared to be hurt again, don't hide away. Try to the things you've been putting off; so years later you don't lament about wasted years. Let's be glad for the things we received today, even if they are lessons meant to hurt.....Gah I have get out of my head and have some fun tonight!

If you like character driven over plot driven novels you\u2019ll love this one."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4820747-laura", "userReview": "First let me say that Barbara Samuel places most of her books in the same part of the country as this - New Mexico or Colorado and it is evident that she knows the area and the different ethnic groups native to the area very well. She is able to bring a distinct voice to each group of very distinct people that inhabit this area in a way that brings the people and the region alive.The plot of this novel, an alcoholic mother who lost her marriage, her child and her career and is slowly rebuilding her life could have become maudlin and melodramatic. But the author doesn't focus on the tragedies of Luna's life, she focuses on her rebuilding of her life and that makes a big difference.If I understand Ms. Samuel and all of her pseudonyms, this book is more of a romance than a women's fiction book, but I actually thought that the romance, while it does take up considerable space in the plot, isn't the main focus of the book. Emphasis is placed on all of her primary relationships, both the good ones and the bad ones, so we get to know Luna as a well rounded character, not just a woman falling in love. There is also considerable attention paid to the relationships of secondary characters in the book, some that Luna has no direct connection to. And yet, even if they are only on the periphery of Luna's life, they also help explain a part of her complex past.I found this book very compelling. I loved watching all of the characters, if not grow, at least gain in their understanding of themselves. I thought parts of it were terribly poignant and parts had universal applicability. It was essentially a novel of growth and acceptance. It had no highly dramatic climax. It seemed much more like the course of real life.Bernadette Dunne is one of my favorite narrators. She voices Samuel's characters beautifully.I highly recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Char", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/274942-char", "userReview": "I admit that it took me awhile to fall in love with this book, to get fully absorbed, but by the end, I was, indeed in love, and fully satisfied in a very meaningful and deep down way. The book lingered with me for a couple weeks afterward. I kept thinking about it. I agree with what Library Journal said about it in its review, \"Samuel has created truly three-dimensional characters, filled with flaws, strengths, and idiosyncrasies. (The reader will never look at Barbie dolls the same way again.) As lyrical as a Spanish ballad, peppered with Southwestern metaphors and allusions, and written in a style evocative of Barbara Kingsolver at her best, this is a book that libraries of all sizes will want to add to their women's fiction and romance collections.\" Absolutely. And boo-hiss to the reviewer who said Maggie's diary entries were amateurish. I LOVED them. And I love Barbara Samuel.

It is full of love and as I read parts of it I could seeethe colors as they are described by Luna. Almost smell the food as she talked about it, I love the closeness of the family. I felt the pull of loneliness as Luna suffered in her past. I felt sorrow when Abuelita saw her house burn down. Built something so good came from her losing her house. Within this beautiful book are so many stories as they come together you will go through emotions with the characters in the book. I really thought the story of Thomas and Luna was a moving love story.I don't want to reveal the twists and turns you will feel as you immerse yourself in this book.. it's hard to put down."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/586622-lisa", "userReview": "I picked up this book on a sale table in Johannesburg. I liked the picture on the front of the girl staring at the faraway mountains. The synopsis sounded good. I have read this book several times now and I'm amazed by it. I'm not actually sure why. The story is good, the setting seems lovely. So different from where I am and I enjoy reading about different places. But there is something about the characters in this book that is real. Not easy lives; not the best choices. Alcoholism, broken families, character flaws--but they keep plodding on. No excuses. I guess these are the type of people I would like to call friends. Something about them speaks to me. I don't know.

That setting enchanted me; it sounds so exotic; the adobe houses, the art community, the Native American origins mixed with century old Hispanic culture. The way the author brings it to life, with all the colors, you would think you are in the middle of a Georgia O\u2019Keeffe painting. I can only presume that the author really knows this part of the New Mexico. It all felt genuine.This story is so much more than a story about love between a female and male protagonist; it\u2019s absolutely about family and how people can find themselves at their best when the people around them who love them accept them for who they are.Barbara Samuel succeeded in rendering great characters; I really liked Luna McGraw, she was so centered and wise, and a good person; something she achieved only because she fought hard at becoming better seeing she\u2019s an alcoholic - now sober four years. Her relationship with her daughter was one of the most enjoyable parts of the story. I don't think Joy was troubled like the book blurp says. Joy is a true gem of a daughter, even at the age of 16. As for Thomas Coyote, the man Luna meets, what can I say? I haven\u2019t come across such a charismatic, earthy and decent man in ... forever! Toss in the Native American appearance and the long black hair and I was sold! Wonderful secondary characters too - Let me say, this is not my all-time favorite Samuel book \u2013 that will always be \"The Sleeping Night\", but it\u2019s a great read nonetheless."}, {"userName": "Robin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4653293-robin", "userReview": "This was a well-written, amazing book.

When they meet they are strongly attracted to each other. Is this another self-destructive choice or can this be the chance for something incredible? This was a wonderful book.

In A Piece of Heaven, she shares another poignant tale rich in atmosphere and insight that explores the complexity of relationships, the importance of family, and the healing power of love. In the sun-baked hills of New Mexico, Luna McGraw has lived a lifetime of regrets, struggling to conquer the demons that destroyed her marriage and caused her to lose custody of her beloved daughter. But as Luna fights to rebuild a relationship with the troubled teenager, she remains haunted by images of her own childhood and the father she barely knew. Strong and resilient as the houses he builds, Thomas Coyote comes into Luna\u2019s life one extraordinary night when his grandmother nearly dies while conjuring a fiery brew of spiritual enchantment. Luna does not need a man\u2014 especially one with a needy ex-wife\u2014to complicate her fragile dreams of the future. Their attraction pushes them both beyond reason into a place where there is only possibility. Yet it will take more than passion to recover the tattered pieces of Luna\u2019s soul, more than time to forgive the sins of an offending husband, and more than promises to mend the broken heart of a child. A Piece of Heaven is an irresistible novel full of colorful characters and lush settings spiced with the magical flavors of the Southwest, a brilliant tapestry of romance and realism by a master storyteller.", "title": "A Piece of Heaven", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1247741.A_Piece_of_Heaven", "average": 3.96, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320470071l/1247741.jpg", "reviews": 56, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/175137.Barbara_Samuel", "name": "Barbara Samuel"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Romance", "Womens Fiction", "Womens Fiction", "Contemporary"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1247741.A_Piece_of_Heaven", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2107692.A_Piece_of_Heaven", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8585552-a-piece-of-heaven", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23924389-a-piece-of-heaven", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9948232-a-piece-of-heaven", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7007055-a-piece-of-heaven", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/451992.The_Goddesses_of_Kitchen_Avenue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2669246-heart-of-a-knight", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1247742.A_Bed_of_Spices", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/602140.In_the_Midnight_Rain", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1936077.Lucien_s_Fall"]}
