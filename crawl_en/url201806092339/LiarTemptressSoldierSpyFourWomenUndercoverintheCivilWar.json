Yes, please.This book is EVERYTHING!* It's like \n\nA League of Their Own\n\n had a lovechild with Shakespeare's \nTwelfth Night,\n and Doris Kearns Goodwin's (DKG) \n\nTeam of Rivals\n\n seasoned with an extra dash of siren song. (Or does one \nnot\n season children?)Actually, it's hard to dream up a single concoction to represent all that is contained in Karen Abbott's \n\nLiar, Temptress, Soldier, Spy\n\n. It is a unique breed of narrative non-fiction, with dialogue taken from primary sources (\u00e0 la Eric Larson or DKG), but with a bit more literary leeway given (e.g. I can't imagine how one would garner access to the dying thoughts of a drowning woman and/or the extent to which a purse full of gold may have tugged at her neck). Additionally, the four women do not share a single story by any stretch of the imagination \u2014 a good thing if, like me, you enjoy \"rotisserie-style\" narration.**Setting the Scene:We open curtain around summertime 1861, which (and I hope you already know this) coincides with the \nAmerican Civil War.\n Since any man worth his mettle is battlefield-bound (click the picture below, The Art of Inspiring Courage, for some of the means by which the lady-folk made sure of this), there are bound to be many changes in the women's world. While some members of the fairer sex were content to contribute to the war effort by darning socks, others went above and beyond the typical call of duty.\nBelle Boyd:Belle's name was the only one with which I was familiar prior to reading this book. If ever there comes a time when we all get to go back in time to slap a person of our choosing, Belle would be pretty high up on my list (though don't tell her that, she'd probably take it as a compliment).\u2020\n\"Why pick on poor Belle?\" you ask. Where do I begin? For one thing, I have an (admittedly ironic) disdain for women who hate other women, and boy did Belle ever begrudge fellow females. She was also a media/attention hound (note how I refrained from using the word whore? oops!) before it was even a thing. When she was finally tossed into \nOld Capitol Prison\n (after her sixth or seventh arrest), she was \"insulted\" by the lack of torment she received relative to Rose O'Neal Greenhow (whom you'll meet soon enough). I couldn't help but feel smug satisfaction when I read that Belle was rebuffed by a fellow inmate in her constant search for a man to marry. Also, she was super into \nGeneral Stonewall Jackson\n \u2014 to a near pathological extent (some might call it John Hinkley-esque), she tried to blackmail Lincoln, and so many other things, but my blood pressure can't take any more contemplation of the self-proclaimed \n\u201cCleopatra of the Secession.\u201d\nSarah Emma Edmonds:Unlike a certain southern drama queen, Emma Edmonds was hoping not to be noticed for her participation in the war. Why? Well, it wasn't strictly legal for a woman to impersonate a man to join the ranks (though, Abbott speculates, that there may have been up to 400 women who did so). However, Emma, not usually one for lying and deception, felt that it was her god-given duty to help with the war effort in whatever way possible. And, thus, one \nFrank Flint Thompson\n enlisted with the 2nd Michigan Infantry.  \n\"Frank\" logged most of his time as a battlefield medic, known as a \"field nurse\" (which had no feminine connotation at the time). Her story has the trials that often come with being a woman playing a man, especially in context intense for all.Edmonds/Thompson's role got even more gender-bending when she was sent undercover as a man pretending to be a woman across enemy lines in order to collect some intel. Her story takes many a turn that I consider spoiler-worthy, so do with that what you will.Rose O'Neal Greenhow:Remember the lady who was lucky enough to receive way more torment than the envious Belle Boyd while locked up in Old Colony Prison? That would be Rose. And, while I'm no fan of Rose's politics, I've gotta give it to her when it comes to spycraft. There are over 174 documents intercepted going to and from Greenhow (some in pretty impressive ciphers) in the National Archives. \nWhy so much fuss over Rose? Well, she was pretty good at her \"job,\" which, after her recruiter/handler, \n\nThomas Jordan,\n\n officially defected to the CSA and went off to war, was pretty much \nSpymistress \nof the\n Confederate Secret Service.\n And, arguably, it was her communication of Union intel to General P. G. T. Beauregard that sealed the Confederate victory at the \nFirst Battle of Bull Run\n. Rose had access to important information as a Washington socialite, well versed in \"flattering\" information out of the city's political elites (and potentially paramours). So, soon enough, \n\nDetective Allan Pinkerton,\n\n head of the \nUnion Intelligence Service, \nwas building up a dossier of info on Rose's activities. \nRose Greenhow, like Belle Boyd, had the annoying habit of \"unsexing\" herself (as far as I'm concerned, if you're running a spy ring and packing heat, you're kind of fair game), and then whining about how unfair it was to subject a woman to such barbarous treatment.Between referring to Unionists as \"slaves of Lincoln...that abolition despot,\" and (pro-slavery as ever) describing seasickness as \"..the greatest evil to which poor human nature can be subjected,\" my patience wore thin with Rose. Also, if you don't want your daughter, \nLittle Rose,\n in prison, you should probably avoid using her as a spy.Elizabeth Van Lew (and Mary Jane too):Elizabeth Van Lew sacrificed what could have otherwise been a cushy life for her abolitionist beliefs. She emancipated her family's slaves (though some opted to stay as paid servants), and spent the bulk of her inheritance buying and freeing their relatives. Living in Richmond, hers was not a particularly popular position to take.\nLike Rose Greenhow, Van Lew ran a sizable spy ring, but her real stroke of genius involved a collaboration between Elizabeth and her much beloved servant (for lack of a better word), \nMary Bowser aka Mary Jane Richards.\n Having taught Mary Jane to read and write, referring to her as a \u201cmaid, of more than usual intelligence,\u201d was quite the understatement. Mary Jane had an exceptional eidetic memory, which was what made her such an amazing asset \"on the inside,\" when Van Lew \"offered\" Mary Jane to \nVarina Davis,\n First Lady of the CSA.Parting words:In an attempt to keep this review from becoming book-length, I'll stop here. If the subject(s) of this book are of interest to you, then I highly recommend it. I enjoyed the writing well enough, though it was hard to separate content from form. However, there aren't nearly enough books out there on kick-ass ladies in Civil War lore, so thanks, Karen Abbott, for that!_______________________________________* That's a thing kids say on the internet these days, right?** Not a real term, but I can't think of a better way to describe the method of rotating among otherwise separate stories.

Well, when Newsweek Magazine asked one thousand Americans the same U.S. Citizenship Test questions required for an immigrant to gain United States Citizenship, 38% must have found it pretty dull stuff. They failed. Seventy percent couldn't tell you what the Constitution was. That's a pretty bleak look on Americans' knowledge about their own country.  Take The Quiz: What We Don't Know  Newsweek Magazine, March 20, 2011.So it is especially refreshing to find a book as skilfully written by an author as talented as Karen Abbott who brings a lesser known area of the American Civil War brilliantly alive. Any reader will find her story of four women and their involvement in the American Civil War anything but dull. With the skill of a novelist, Abbott weaves the lives of four exceptional and independent women into the complex history of the times. Nor does Abbott accomplish her task without the credentials to back up her work. Abbott writes the History column for Smithsonian.com and Disunion, the continuing series on the American Civil War for The New York Times.\n\nKaren Abbott is the author of Sin in the Second City: Madams, Ministers, Playboys, and the Battle for America's Soul, and American Rose. Writing of strong, independent women, outside traditional roles, I consider her a feminist historian.\nOh. Don't be misled by the author's looks. Yes, she's a beautiful woman. Yes, she certainly turned this reader's head. But make no mistake about it. She has a mind as sharp as the finest Toledo steel. This is a history that is fully noted with a bibliography of sources that should satisfy any historian.Writing of women's role in the American Civil War, Abbott said in her introductory note:\nSome--privately or publicly, with shrewd caution or gleeful abandon --chafed at the limitations society set for them and determined to change the course of the war. In the pages that follow I tell the story of four such women: a rebellious teenager with a dangerous temper; a Canadian expat on the run from her past; a widow and a mother with nothing else to lose; and a wealthy society matron who endured death threats for years, and lost as much as she won. Each, in her own way, was a liar, a temptress, a soldier, and a spy, sometimes all at once.\"If that doesn't grab your attention, I don't know what will.Belle Boyd, the teenager with the dangerous temper.Belle was seventeen when the war began. She lived with her parents in Martinsburg, Virginia, near the top of the Shenandoah Valley. She was impetuous. As one of the belles of Martinsburg described her, she was \"man crazy.\" When Union troops entered Martinsburg and invaded her home, she killed a Yankee soldier whom she thought was too rough with her mother. Early in the war, there were no repercussions. The North wanted no repercussions among Southern civilians--yet. Belle's father was a member of Stonewall Jackson's Brigade, though he had not earned that nickname yet. During the battle of Falling Waters, Belle Boyd ran across the field of battle to warn Jackson of the number and deployment of Union troops. She was instrumental in Jackson's victory. Belle, ever the romantic, became enamored of Jackson. Surprise. Belle's feelings were not returned. Eventually Belle became a courier for the Confederacy. She was imprisoned in the Capitol Prison in Washington, D.C. She was subsequently exiled to the South, paroled on the condition that she never return to Union soil. Ironically, Martinsburg was located in what became West Virginia. Belle Boyd would be exiled from home or in violation of her parole. It is left to the reader to discover what happened to Belle.Rose Greenhow, the widow and mother with nothing left to lose.To be continued..."}, {"userName": "Carly", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4490040-carly", "userReview": "DNF.I made it over halfway, but I give up.To me, the most important aspect of nonfiction is that it be nonfiction. Unfortunately, writers of pop nonfiction usually go for the most sensational versions of the truth that they can find.To my mind, this book falls into that trap. Abbott's book is clearly well-researched, but she tends to present as fact information from such dubious sources as the women's own memoirs or stories from Harper's Weekly. Since many of the women parleyed their life stories into various careers, it was in their own interests to make them as sensational as possible.I also felt that Abbott doesn't carefully delineate from her own embroidering and her sources. She doesn't tend to attribute her \"facts\" to any particular source, even when they come from such dubious places as Belle Boyd's romanticized versions of events. She also repeats stories from Sarah Emma Edmonds' memoir, though even Abbott can't quite swallow some of the ones that are provably false. Like Boyd, Edmonds sold her memoir and thus had reason to make it as sensational as possible. I don't really believe, for example, that she visited home in her male disguise and that her mother broke down in tears because \"Frank\" reminded her of her lost daughter and that she dramatically uncovered her true identity to the rejoicing of her mother and sister. Abbott swallows it hook, line, and sinker.I dispute many of Abbott's facts, such as her inclusion of such tall tales as the soldier at Bull Run who was saved by a Bible in his pocket (his name was William Preston Magnum, and while there's no real evidence that the bullet was deflected by his Bible, it is an indisputable fact that he died from his wounds a week later and was buried at Manassas.)The overwritten, purple-prosy style didn't do much for me either. If I wanted to read Victorian over-sensationalism, I'd go pick up the ladies' memoirs. To be clear, I do think that Abbott has sources for all of the stories she tells. I just don't believe the veracity of her sources.I think these women were incredible and fascinating. I believe they deserve to have their true stories told, not the hyperbolic and romanticized versions that their lives inspired.Cross-posted on BookLikes."}, {"userName": "Paige", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27055286-paige", "userReview": "When I say I want to read about interesting women, this is EXACTLY what I mean. Liar, Temptress, Soldier, Spy tells the story of:\u2022BELLE BOYD : self proclaimed \"Cleopatra of the Succession\" and a real piece of work. Before the age of 20, Belle had already killed a man, become a spy for the Confederacy, and been arrested (for being a spy). Always on the lookout for a husband, and pathologically obsessed with Stonewall Jackson, Belle Boyd flirted and canoodled her way through the Civil War. I found her epilogue in particular extremely interesting.\u2022EMMA EDMONDS : youngest child of a father who never loved her, Emma pulled a Mulan and joined up. Serving in the Union army as a war nurse, post master, and spy, Emma (who went by the name Frank Thompson) managed to conceal her gender for years, all the while surrounded by thousands of soldiers - never able to let her guard down. Emma's story was my personal favorite, and I highly recommend this book if only for Emma.\u2022ROSE O'NEALE GREENHOW : another piece of work. Rose, a widow with a young daughter (named Little Rose), became a Confederate spy whilst living in Union territory. Rose gathered an astonishing amount of information and passed it on in the early days of the war. Rose's whole thing was seduction. She had many an affair with Union soldiers, all for the cause. While I didn't agree with her politics or personal beliefs, I can respect that this woman was damn formidable.\u2022 ELIZABETH VAN LEW: abolitionist and spy. Elizabeth lived in Richmond and spied for the Union. She could easily have lived a quiet life of comfort, but instead, she spent the majority of her sizable inheritance freeing slaves and helping smuggle Union POWs to safety.

Even though I didn't agree with all of their actions or beliefs, I respect every one of them for having the conviction to stand by their beliefs and the follow through to do something about it.Update: Since reading this I've been seized by a wild desire to read and/or watch Gone With The Wind."}, {"userName": "Cher", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4776032-cher", "userReview": "2 stars - Meh.

In my own head, I typically don't think about women having a role in fighting the Civil War. We don't typically hear about them out on the battle field unless they are in a nursing role. This book sheds light on some of the bravery that women showed during the Civil War.The Civil War definitely isn't my favorite historical event to learn about but with books like this to make it a lot more exciting to me, it makes me think that maybe I need to give the Civil War more than a passing glance when it comes to my reading. I love nonfiction, especially narrative non-fiction. This book has something for everyone. There's great people and great story lines. There's intrigue and espionage. I found myself reading parts of it to my husband even though I'm totally making him read this book now that I've finished!!!This book is anything but dry and feels very much like fiction. The way that the author weaves in so much detail about these four women and their lives really drew me into the book. Some of the women identify with the Union and some identify with the Confederacy but all four are committed to their various causes. It was so interesting to me to see how of these women were able to move about in a society that it wasn't necessarily very permissive for women at that time.

I already knew about each of these women-- had even read parts of Rebel Rose's and all of Sarah Emma Edmonds' memoirs-- but I feel like I learned SO MUCH about them and the lengths that they and many others went through in pursuit of their ideals. Abbott gives a thorough, compelling, suspenseful account of each woman's life during the war years, portraying them each with sensitivity and careful detail, giving voice to their beliefs and allowing the reader to come to her own conclusion about each woman (my conclusion: I'd like to hang out with Sara Emma Edmonds and be a fly on the wall near the rest, just to watch them in action). I am so impressed with the amount of research that went into this book and the seamless way Abbott combines direct quotes with novelistic description, often managing to end chapters on cliffhangers. My one criticism, which is owing to my preference for reading fiction and that I mostly read in fits and starts these days, is that I had a hard time keeping track of the many minor personages who dot the pages.

On the side of the Union there's Emma Edmonds, a Canadian woman who disguised herself as a man and fought, nursed and spied for the Union. There's also Elizabeth Van Lew, a wealthy Union supporter living in Richmond who dared use her personal resources to help escaped prisoners and pass on information to General Grant. Honorable mention to her friend and former slave Mary Jane Bowser who worked undercover as a servant in the Confederate White House spying and passing information on the Union Underground Railroad of information. The Confederate women include Mrs. Rose O'Neale Greenhow, a beautiful widow living and spying in Washington, DC and Belle Boyd, a Virginia teenager enamored with Stonewall Jackson and the Southern cause who brashly and boldly flirted, flattered, spied and carried messages for the Confederacy. The writing is lively and easy to understand for non-academics. Each chapter ends in suspense, urging the reader to keep reading. I got really caught up in the stories of the Confederate women, of whom I had heard but knew little and also Emma's story because I'm certain I read a YA fiction novel based on her story. It was thrilling enough without fiction. The one story I knew well was Elizabeth Van Lew's because of two fictional books I had read about her. Still I enjoyed reading the true story behind the fiction. The stories of these amazing women would make a great movie and no one would believe it! They were all so strong under enormous pressure. Their clandestine activities meant life or death and the fate of our nation was on line. My biggest problem with this book is lack of footnotes. There are endnotes in the back but they're not numbered in the text. I know casual readers find footnotes annoying but I'm an academic and need footnotes. My other beef is the author likes to add little flourishes to her prose like \"she left in a swirl of petticoats and a stomp of boots.\" or something like that. It's not good writing for a non-fiction book. Again I am sure that's what readers of popular history want but it's not the way I was taught. I was also taught to clarify - don't say mothers smuggled medicines in the heads of their daughters' dolls. How many women, where, when? This isn't even an accurate statement - there are two dolls in one museum believed to have been used to smuggle drugs during the Civil War. I also question some of the sources used in this book. Many of the information on Elizabeth Van Lew comes from family members decades after the fact. If I wasn't an academic, I probably would have rated the book 5 stars. I think my grandmother, a history buff but not an academic, will enjoy this book.

And I did enjoy it, especially as woman are so often overlooked in Civil War history (well, history in general) unless Scarlett O'Hara is present. But it felt a little fractured to me. It may have been the way it was told, jumping back and forth from story to story just when I getting immersed in one life. Partially, I thought it was too long, so all of Abbott's delightful snazziness from her first book was missing (granted, they are two very different topics). She might have been better served by focusing on just one or two of these woman, in more depth, than on all four. Although I don't know which ones to leave out, as I thought she included a good cross section of experiences and used them to successfully illustrate the various reactions men had to meeting these strong women. One of my biggest complaints, though, is that this is the second book I have read this year that tries to \"novel up\" (my phrase) nonfiction accounts. What I mean by that is that even though the author may use the actual conversations as recorded, they embellish the scene with all sorts of details we couldn't possibly know: the curtains fluttering the breeze, the sound of taffeta, etc. At least Abbott knows she is doing it and admits in her introduction, but I still don't like it.

In this work of non-fiction, Abbott tells the story of four women who served as spies during the Civil War. Belle Boyd was a teenager when work broke out, and a hotheaded one at that. Belle became a spy for the Confederacy, seducing men to get them to tell all. Emma Edmonds ran away from home to avoid a forced marriage. To survive, she dressed as a man and joined the Union army, where she was eventually recruited to serve as an undercover spy. Rose O'Neale Greenhow was a widow who seduced Unionists to gain intelligence for the Confederacy. She and her young daughter were imprisoned for their crimes against the United States. And finally, Elizabeth Van Lew, a well-to-do Richmond spinster with Union loyalties, served as bath a Union spy and a safe house for Union soldiers escaping from the Southern prison. This account was fascinating, but that's largely because Abbott has cherry picked four of the most fascinating stories from the Civil War to include. These women did not know one another and never met, yet Abbott has done an excellent job of weaving the four disparate stories together into one chronological tale. However, at times I had a difficult time to keep the four women separate in my mind, and to even remember for which side which woman was spying. I couldn't help but have my favorites among the four women portrayed. Emma Edmonds fascinated me because she successfully pulled off serving as a female in a male army. Emma was one of around four hundred women who posed and fought as men during the Civil War. Perhaps even more impressive, once recruited to be a sspy Emma posed as a man posing as at times as a black man, and at times as a woman in order to infiltrate into the Southern army - which surely must have been confusing. Yet she was never caught and exposed as a woman. Many years later after the end of the war, she did reveal her gender to her fellow soldiers.Additionally, I developed great respect for Elizabeth Van Lew, who was much hated in Richmond for her abolitionist beliefs, yet stood firm by them. Elizabeth managed to install her black servant Mary Jane in the Confederate president's house. Little did President Davis know that Mary Jane was \"highly educated and gifted with an eidetic memory, capable of memorizing images in a glance, and recalling entire conversations word for word\" (83). Additionally, Elizabeth successfully hid escaped Unionists in a secret room in her house, even when Southern army officers were staying with her. She was adept at aiding the Union army, and did so at considerable personal expense.All four women in this book were willing to risk their life for their beliefs. All four sacrificed in numerous ways, including in bodily comfort, health, finances, and safety.

I recently read one of Karen Abbott's other books, Sin in the Second City: Madams, Ministers, Playboys, and the Battle for America's Soul which was teeming with interesting historical characters, but I found LTSS held together better overall. The author's tendency to extrapolate colorful, emotive, \"fictional\" scenes and dialogue out of primary sources (common in pop-history books) did grate on me at times. I would have liked a disclaimer or two about the veracity of the primary sources--some of memoir-based scenes, like Emma's visit home disguised as \"Frank\", struck me contrived--but I still appreciated the sentiment behind whatever inspired Emma herself to record such a scene to begin with.

I liked that Emma and Elizabeth spent their time nursing soldiers back to health. I was not quite as impressed with Belle and Rose using their womanly wiles to confuse the soldiers and obtain information and favors. I liked Rose the least because she put her ambitions and activism above the health of her daughter, who starved alongside her in prison. Rose was also an unapologetic racist. *fume*Belle was kind of interesting because she acted very much like Scarlet O'Hara, flirting with the other soldiers and worshipping the generals like a groupie.

Badass women undercover?? Sign me up. I've just always had trouble with history, for whatever reason. Abbott makes Civil War history so interesting and accessible, without dumbing it down. All of the women included were incredible in what they were willing to do either for their sides of the war.Something I really liked was how Abbott doesn't present those who fought on the Confederate side of things like villains. She just presented the facts and the personalities; what the women did without judgement. No side was glorified, every woman flawed and incredible in their own way. Also, when I saw Abbott speak she described one of the women, Belle Boyd, as a mixture of Sarah Palin and Miley Cyrus, which is SO ACCURATE. If that doesn't make you want to know more about these women, I don't know what will.Full review: Outlandish Lit - 3 Books About People Who Aren't What They Seem"}, {"userName": "drea ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/253027-drea", "userReview": "This is the kind of NF I always love, yet struggle to find.

Karen Abbott\u2019s new book, LIAR TEMPTRESS SOLDIER SPY: FOUR WOMEN UNDERCOVER IN THE CIVIL WAR has many elements of the espionage master\u2019s work and she weaves a series of wonderful stories into a historical narrative that could pass for fiction. The book Abbott has written explores the role of women during the Civil War, an area that has not been addressed sufficiently by historians. Her work is less about the contribution of women in general who performed domestic tasks for confederate and union forces, but mostly about the lives of four women who played prominent roles during the war; Rose O\u2019Neal Greenhow and Belle Boyd who supported secession, and Elizabeth Van Lew and Emma Edmonds who remained loyal to the union. All four women engaged in espionage during the war, and their lives reflect their own personal dangers in addition to the death and destruction that they witnessed during the \u201cwar between the states.\u201d In telling the stories of these heroines, Abbott integrates important aspects of the political and military history of the war into her narrative very effectively as each statement or document that appears is supported by by her research, though there are a number of places in the narrative when she appears to take some poetic license as she quotes from works of fiction as if they were accurate sources. For the reader who sets out to read Abbott\u2019s historical monograph they will find that, at times, it reads like an espionage thriller. As they progress in the book they will meet many important historical characters, including; General Stonewall Jackson, General George McClellan, Detective Alan Pinkerton, Abraham Lincoln, Louis Napoleon III among many others. The book is organized chronologically with alternating chapters dealing with each of the subject women. At times this approach can be confusing, and perhaps each woman could have been dealt with separately to create greater cohesion and then a chapter or two discussing how their lives may have interacted. None the less the book is a quick and interesting read and focuses attention on four unsung heroes who can now be seen in a new light.What separates Abbott\u2019s account of the war is her in depth portrayal of her subjects and how they used their own inner resources to place themselves at risk in promoting the cause they believed in and were willing to die for. The first, Belle Boyd, a charismatic character, who loved the limelight and had a force of personality that dominated most situations she found herself in. Raised in Martinsburg, Va. she was a staunch secessionist who abhorred the union. She engaged in numerous plots to acquire intelligence for the confederacy and employed her saucy, feminine whiles with men to gain whatever she needed. Her life is fascinating and is worthy of her own biography. Perhaps her lowest moment in the war, aside from the defeat the south suffered was the secession of western Virginia, including her own home county of Berkley, forming the state of West Virginia. Second we meet Emma Edmondson, Canadian women who wanted to join the union army. The strategy she adopted was to assume the identity of a man named Frank Thompson and when she survived her physical exam she joined Company F, 2nd Michigan infantry. She began as a male nurse and soon became a mail currier and spy for the union. She kept her identity secret from everyone but two soldiers she served with that she fell in love with. She survived a great deal of combat and was very effective. Throughout the war she feared someone above her in rank would discover her true sex more than she feared death. Her life is also an amazing story and she did write her own memoir entitled; MEMOIRS OF A SOLDIER, NURSE AND SPY! A WOMAN\u2019S ADVENTURES IN THE UNION ARMY. Third, is the life of Rose O\u2019Neal Greenhow who lived in Washington, DC and was counted on by the Confederacy to obtain as much intelligence as possible. She was friends with Confederate General P.G.T. Beauregard and headed a spy ring prone to \u201cindiscretions\u201d with men. She worshiped Southern senator, John C. Calhoun of South Carolina and mirrored his political views. She had a number of lovers, the most important of which was Henry P. Wilson, an abolitionist Republican who was the union Chairman of the Military Affairs Committee. She has been credited with providing the intelligence that allowed the confederacy to defeat the union army at the first Battle of Bull Run (Manassas). During the course of her career she was arrested a few times and served short prison sentences in Washington at the Capitol Prison. After being exiled to the south she was sent by Jefferson Davis to England and France to try and gain recognition of the Confederacy by these nations. On her return to the United States her blockade running ship was intercepted by the Union Navy. Lastly, and probably the most impactful of the four women on the course of the war was Elizabeth Van Lew, a wealthy society woman, and a strong unionist who lived in Richmond. Her career as a spy was fraught with danger since most of her neighbors and politicians in the confederate capitol knew her wartime sympathies. There were numerous attempts to try and catch her, by searching her mansion which became a union safe house, constant searches by detectives, and numerous attempts at entrapment. Despite all of these obstacles she organized and ran the Richmond spy ring and its conduit to the Underground Railroad for escaped slaves and union soldiers to the north, and maintained a \u201csecret room\u201d upstairs in her mansion as a transshipment point for those fleeing the south. General Grant, grateful for her work sent her a personal note: \u201cyou have sent me the most valuable information received from Richmond during the war.\u201d Grant awarded her the position of Postmaster General of Richmond during his presidency to try and compensate her for all the wealth that was poured into the northern cause during the war.It is not my purpose to recapitulate Abbott\u2019s narrative but they are a myriad of interesting and surprising revelation that she brings to the fore. Since women were not allowed to serve in the union army and there really was no military legal precedent for what to charge them should they be caught, union military officials would kick them out of the army under the charge of prostitution. There were about 300-400 women in the union army during the Civil War, and Abbott tells a number of stories dealing with their plight. In addition, the author relates the activities of Detective Alan Pinkerton who was in charge of union espionage for part of the war. The role of detectives emerges throughout the narrative and how they interacted with Boyd, Greenhow, and Van Lew. We witness a blend of societal graciousness and hospitality on all sides, but at the same time Abbott is letting the reader know what each character thought. The chapter that deals with Pinkerton\u2019s arrest of Rose Greenhow is priceless. Abbott describes in detail the house search and how Greenhow was able to finagle documents into the hands of her eight year old daughter, \u201cLittle Rose,\u201d as the conduit to avoid detection by Pinkerton\u2019s agents and getting the intelligence to sources outside her home. Even under constant surveillance Greenhow continue to spy for the Confederacy employing her daughter as her currier. Another important vignette that Abbott discusses is how Elizabeth Van Lew, a friend of Confederate President Jefferson Davis\u2019 wife is able to convince her to take on one of her freed slaves as a servant in the Confederate White House. As the war turns against the Confederacy, Davis, for a time, is at a loss as to how Union spies seem to know military plans soon after he had conferred with General Robert E. Lee, or other southern generals. The work of Van Lew\u2019s servant, Mary Jane, was certainly an important contribution to the Union cause.Karen Abbott has certainly done a service to the memory of four women who were under cover during the Civil War. It makes for an excellent read and I recommend it to Civil War buffs and those interested in an aspect of women\u2019s history that few are familiar with. As Elizabeth Van Lew alluded to after the war, women made major contributions to the northern victory but when it came for them to receive military pensions they had to beg men for what was due them, because they did not have the vote."}, {"userName": "Lena", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35645863-lena", "userReview": "I was completely entertained; best time I\u2019ve had reading a history book!

The women Belle Boyd, Rose O\u2019Neal Greenhow, Elizabeth Van Lew and Emma Edmonds each have a unique story and the author keeps a fast pace making this book a page turner. Belle Boyd was living in what is now West Virginia and a supporter of the south when Union soldiers came into the town to occupy. Upon entering the house Boyd shot a Union solider and earned notoriety for it. She continued her work as a courier for the confederates and serving her idol General Stonewall Jackson. After being arrested and sent to prison in the north where she continued her strong acts of defiance shew as finally exchanged on parole and told to stay out of the North. Acting as an overseas courier she was stopped on a ship and detained by the navy where she charmed one captain into marrying her. Boyd is a southern hero who craved fame above all else and was a true believer in the cause especially wanting to follow her idol Stonewall. Rose O\u2019Neal Greenhow was a socialite in Washington DC who was a strong supporter of the Southern Cause. She charmed top military leaders and senators to gleam information and send them to her friend Beaugrard. She was credited by confederate authorities for providing the key information in allowing First Manassas to be a victory. Greenhow was arrested by the north and became one of the first women detained during the war along with her daughter. After she was exchanged she was a celebrity in the south and was sent on a diplomatic mission to England and France to try and win support for the cause there. Although not successful she mingled with many top European diplomats and leaders including Palmerstone and Napoleon III. Elizabeth Van Lew was a northern sympathizer living in Richmond who organized one of the most extensive spy rings in world history up until this point. Using dozens of operatives she smuggled prisoners to the north with valuable information including placing one of her slaves in service to Jefferson Davis at the southern White House. Van Lew had seen to it that her slave was educated and could read and write which the Davis\u2019 did not know allowing her to read top level documents and pass the information on to Van Lew. Grant would maintain a friendship with Van Lew long after the war even making her postmaster of Richmond during his presidency as a thank you for the services she rendered him during the war. Sending over 100 dispatches a week around the time of the campaigns for the siege on Richmond she provided some of the most valuable intelligence of the war on what was happening in Richmond. Emma Edmonds assumed the identity of a man long before the civil war but enlisted as Frank Thompson and fought in several battles early in the war as well as serving as a currier and medical assistant throughout the war. Emma would reveal her identity to only two other soldiers and played a dangerous game by hiding her gender during the war. Finally becoming a spy in Kentucky and delivering information to the Unions did she decide it was time for a different path and deserted as Frank and reenrolling in the Army as a nurse under her identity of Emma. Many years after the war she revealed herself as Frank in order to gain her veteran benefits. Overall this is a fast paced book that portrays a side only told in academia in a fun and readable manner. For those interested in some of the various roles of women in the civil was you will not go wrong with this book."}, {"userName": "El", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83144-el", "userReview": "About five years ago I read They Fought Like Demons: Women Soldiers in the Civil War. It was a fine book, but on the dry end. What was exciting to me was the discussion of women in a position that was filled primarily by men, and the education most of us receive in schools about the American Civil War keep women out of the lectures pretty much entirely, except when talking about women in a feminine role during the war (nurses, teachers, prostitutes, mothers, sisters, wives, etc. etc.).The reality is that women did play a sometimes very important role. In They Fought Like Demons we learned that some women went to great lengths to fight alongside men on the fields. In Liar, Temptress, Soldier, Spy, Abbott focuses on four different women (two who supported the Confederates, two who supported the Union) and discussed their undercover roles in the war.Each woman had a reason for their actions, and whether or not the reader agrees with every single one of them, the fact is that to these women (just like the men who signed up to fight) felt what they were doing was important for the greater good. It was impressive reading about what some of these women went through and what they further put themselves through to do their part, to prove their point, to do what they felt was right and good.I was impressed by Abbott's attention to detail. She did a shitload of research for this book, and I honestly felt it could have been longer. Just flipping through the extensive notes at the end of the book made me realize just how much information Abbott went through to write this book.I read this as part of a group, and someone mentioned they were concerned that there was a bit too much fictionalization happening. I hadn't thought about it at first until it was brought up, but after that I couldn't stop thinking about it. Abbott does mention in the introduction that this is attributed to what she was able to pull from primary sources and family stories, etc., and that was enough for me initially. But as someone else pointed out, it's hard to know for sure the veracity of the primary sources - I believe each of the women kept detailed journals about their experiences, but it's possible that some of them wrote an exaggerated version of their lives in order to make money later, or whatever.So that's something to keep in mind.However, the readability of the book, and the amount of information Abbott provided, was enough to keep me fascinated throughout. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in the American Civil War, especially for those (like myself) who are especially intrigued by women's roles."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1710557-amy", "userReview": "I've lived the north and south of the Civil War aftermath: born and raised in the DC area, moved to a border state (home of the Dred-Scott decision for most of my adolescence, and then settled here in the South for the past 40 or so years. There are many aspects, besides the politics of the war, that I find fascinating. The fierce loyalty some folks have for their homeland, for instance, or the burning desire to fight for their personal beliefs. To me, fighting means taking an intellectual stand, not the physical personal risks the four women in Liar, Temptress, Soldier, Spy  did. The women, each fully dedicated to their cause, are skillfully depicted by Karen Abbott. I heard her talk about the book on NPR, and the interview fascinated me so much, I immediately sought out the book.The four women are very different in personality and approach to how they helped. Belle Boyd was flamboyant, rambunctious, daring in an overt way, very much an extroverted young woman. I found myself wondering what labels a psychiatrist would slap on her were she to end up on a couch today. I suppose as a kid I sometimes fantasized about passing as a boy so that I could have a more rough and tumble life (I grew up in the late 50's), but I am not sure I would have tried to pass as a male and join the Union army, as Emma Edmonds did. It's interesting, also to note, that there are several books out of late about women disguised as men and fighting in the Civil War. Edmonds experience was spurred not by the desire to be next to her sweetheart, unlike most of these women on other books, but to escape a bad home life and put distance between her present and past. Rose O\u2019Neale Greenhow was the only one of the four women I really knew anything about beforehand, some of which I \"knew\" being incorrect. A clever and cunning spy, she was able to pass messages and information even when under house arrest by the Yankees. Elizabeth Van Lew, who lived in Richmond, was shunned as an abolitionist, while getting valuable information to the North, and aiding the escape of many Union prisoners and Southern slaves.Oddly, though, the two people I want to read more about are not these four women, but \"Little Rose\", the youngest daughter of Greenhow, and Mary Elizabeth Bowser, a freed slave that Van Lew helped place in the southern white house as part of her spy ring. Bowser was both educated and possessed of a photographic memory, thus was able to gain access and recall intimate details of the strategy and plans discussed by Jefferson Davis and his officers.A long, but interesting read."}, {"userName": "Hannah \u2022 So Obsessed With", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3238412-hannah-so-obsessed-with", "userReview": "The book doesn't really delve into all the intricacies of the war, but I felt like I saw a completely new side of it because of these women.

The Civil War is the most studied period in American History. During this tumultuous time, the country was torn apart. Brother fought brother, as Americans took up arms against one another. It was a period of great loss and turmoil. While men fought at the front, women were making their own sacrifices and contributions. In this book, you get the stories of four different and remarkable women. This is a book for any Civil War fan. What I Liked:*First and foremost, I appreciated the author\u2019s attention to detail. Many hours of meticulous research went into this book. I liked that she didn\u2019t embellish or fictional the accounts. She used actual journals and writings of those involved. I hate when I pick up a historical book and find that the author has taken liberties with certain things. That is not the case here. *I liked that the book highlighted the lives of four different women. Belle Boyd, rebel, who used her skills of seduction to learn secrets and report them to the Confederacy. Rose O\u2019Neal Greenhow, another spymistress for the Confederacy used her wiles and charm to seduce men and report their secrets. Then there are two women loyal to the Union. Emma Edmonds masqueraded as a Union solider, fought battles and served as a battlefield medic. Finally, Elizabeth Van Lew, a Union sympathizer living in Richmond, the heart of the Confederacy. Libby aided the Union by hiding soldiers in her home, carrying secrets to Grant, and by placing one of her own servants in the home of Jefferson Davis gather intel. I loved learning about these four unique woman and how they aided the government they served. Talk about girl power. There were so many interesting tidbits about the war that I found fascinating. If you are wanting to learn more about this era, this is a good book to read. *I was thrilled that Ms. Abbot focused the story on two women from each side, giving a balanced view of the war. Lots of times books about the Civil War are biased toward one side. I felt that this book presented the facts and remained neutral. And The Not So Much:*The one thing that didn\u2019t work for me was that this book was confusing. I wish that it was better organized. The narrative moves from one woman to another, and it was hard to keep track of everything. The author divides the book into years, so you get a rather jumbled narrative. I think perhaps it would have been better to divide it into separate sections, either each woman\u2019s story told completing before moving to the others, or keep all the details for one particular woman during that year in one section. The book is a bit chaotic and confusing. *I found myself drawn to Libby and Emma far more than the other two, I just didn\u2019t like Rose and Belle as much, they were a too melodramatic. I wished that more time was spent on Emma as she was the most fascinating. Liar, Temptress, Solider, Spy was a thrilling, detailed and informative book that shares the lives of four different women who helped influence the North and South. If you are an fan of this era, and even if you aren\u2019t, this is a book worth checking out. I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own, and I was not compensated for this review.

I couldn't wait to read it. And while I had some quibbles with the author's writing style, I mostly enjoyed this book very much and learned so much from it, about the American Civil War in general and the active roles of women in that conflict specifically. I had no idea that women had played such active roles, not only in combat, but also in espionage and politics, so reading this story was a delightful surprise in that respect. Karen Abbott seems to have painstakingly researched her topic and creates vivid pictures of the four women on which this book focuses. She includes a lot of detail, most of which feels germaine to the narrative. My primary complaint about her writing style was how she inserts details into her retellings which she could not possibly know. details about how someone's heels clicked on the floor as she walked back and forth, or what was going on in the mind of a drowning woman just before she died. I realize it's artistic liberty to make the story more intense and more readable, but when the book comes with a foreword specifically mentioning how everything in the story is factual. I appreciate that the only dialogue is not invented, but only quoted if actually recorded in a historic source. I'm sure that Abbott observed scrupulous care with keeping all salient details and quotations historically true and accurate. I just personally felt that her level of extrapolation and embellishment was distracting, and made the story feel more like a fictionalization and less like a true event. However, Abbott's writing style and detailed research certainly does create vivid, life-like characters. I may not have LIKED what I heard about most of the women, but I had a strong sense of who they were, and what motivated their decisions. The seething rage and brilliant cunning of Rose Greenhow, the reckless, attention-seeking (narcissistic or borderline?) bravado of Belle Boyd, the slightly delusional but nevertheless self-sacrificing bravery of Emma Edmondson/ Frank Thompson, and the intelligent, relentless determination and yet loneliness of Elizabeth Van Lew. Each of these women is remarkable and admirable for their accomplishments, if not their personal charms or lack thereof. I'll admit that my disgust at the racism of Belle Boyd and Rose Greenhow strongly colored my perceptions of them, but even without the personal outrage, I'm not sure I would have found them likable characters. I liked Emma/ Frank a lot more, but found her disturbingly unstable and almost self-delusional about so much in her life. Elizabeth Van Lew was perhaps the most self-aware and even handed of the characters, and thus I found that I liked her much more than any of the other women. I admired her principles, and how they informed all aspects of her life and behavior, regardless of the risks to herself and all for which and whom she was responsible. The audio edition helps to inform this strong sense of character as well, I think. The narrator does a lovely job giving each of the women a distinctive voice and mannerisms, and separating those from the many other characters introduced throughout the narrative. The level of detail about the people and situations around the primary women of this narrative could almost be distracting, and yet I can see why the author felt they were necessary to set the stage and fully explain the situations and stakes which the four women faced. All in all, I came away with a lot more knowledge about the American Civil War, and a lot more sadness about it. I don't think history books and rousing movies adequately convey the horror of it, the blind hatred towards those of the opposing side, and the heinous atrocities committed against vulnerable people of each side. I also came away a little angry that, after graduating high school AND college, with history classes during both, I could walk away with no knowledge of the extent and importance of women's roles (outside of nursing) during the Civil War. Women weren't just nurses or disguised soldiers. They represented the South in European diplomatic encounters. They provided intelligence that literally changed the course of the War over and over again. This should be common public knowledge. There should be historical monuments to the accomplishments of women like these, instead of burying them in the footnotes of American history. The overriding sadness of most of their lives after the war ended should not negate their heroism and impressive accomplishments during it. So thank you, Ms Abbott, for shedding some light on the bravery and determination of these women. Everyone should read this book and others like it, and learn a little more about the accomplishments of women in history, and the horrors that come from extreme political and cultural divisions within a country."}, {"userName": "Emma Deplores Goodreads Censorship", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship", "userReview": "Wow: I loved this, and I am so over reading about the American Civil War. But, really, what could be better than a detailed and exciting nonfiction account of four women who played key roles in the war? This book combines the best of both worlds: the perspective and historical background of nonfiction with the narrative suspense of fiction, all while relating the accounts of four larger-than-life figures I'd never heard of. I call that a win.The book, consisting of 430 pages in hardcover not counting endnotes and references, is organized chronologically, alternating among the stories of four women. Belle Boyd was a daring teenager, hungry for adventure and renown, who brazened her way into Union camps for information and once ran across a battlefield with a message for Stonewall Jackson. Emma Edmonds, disguised as a man, enlisted as a Union soldier, serving as a medic, mail carrier and part-time spy, a role in which she occasionally \"disguised\" herself as a woman. Rose O'Neal Greenhow was a Washington socialite who ran a spy ring on behalf of the Confederacy. And Elizabeth Van Lew of Richmond spied for the Union, orchestrating the escapes of Union prisoners and even placing an undercover \"slave,\" Mary Jane Bowser, in Jefferson Davis's home. (I wish the book had included Mary Jane's story, too; presumably there was not enough written about her to sustain a detailed nonfiction narrative, but someone should take note and write a novel!)In many ways, this book reads like a novel: it is dramatic and suspenseful and brings scenes from the Civil War to life, while focusing on the individual women's experiences rather than bogging down in details of battles or economics. A few strategically placed chapters discuss the movements of armies and generals, but these exist only to supplement and explain the women's stories. Abbott makes great use of her research, and I was fascinated and astonished by much of it, as I am with the best nonfiction: much of this material I would not have believed in a novel. Belle Boyd wandered around Union camps stealing weapons for the Confederacy and hiding them in her skirt? Emma Edmonds infiltrated Confederate camps disguised as a male slave, and no one figured her out? Rose Greenhow's defense to charges of spying was \"I'm a woman. I hear things, I tell my friends. Your men should know better than to talk to me\" - and it worked? There is a tendency to imagine people in the past as much more stiff and regimented than ourselves, so to see the America of 150 years ago as a chaotic place full of people who made mistakes, where a bit of daring combined with poor communication systems could get an undercover agent a long way, was a revelation for me.In her portrayals of the four women, I found Abbott evenhanded; some were more difficult than others, but their personalities come through in the writing, and it's easy to sympathize with their stories even when their opinions are abhorrent to the modern reader. All four of the women profiled here were fascinating, complex individuals, who found great purpose in their war work - their later lives seem sad and anticlimactic by comparison, and in that respect the epilogue is not a cheerful one, though one can't help but be impressed by the strength and courage they display, each in her own way. There is a high level of historical detail, and Abbott has a strong journalistic style, which carries the reader easily through the story.I am not rounding up to 5 stars for two reasons. One, the book loses a bit of steam in the second half, though it isn't Abbott's fault that three of her protagonists have been neutralized by this point. Two, though she has plenty of other sources, the book does rely heavily on the women's own memoirs and journals, though they are noted in some places to be unreliable. I appreciate Abbott's extensive background research and her including nearly 60 pages of endnotes and references, but inevitably, many of the personal stories have no other source than the memoirs themselves.But those minor quibbles don't prevent me from wholeheartedly recommending this book, which is both amazing fun and an excellent history lesson. I would recommend this to those who aren't sure they'd enjoy nonfiction or books about the Civil War, as well as anyone who loves books about unique historical women. I will be watching for more from this author!"}, {"userName": "Dan Curnutt", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1065879-dan-curnutt", "userReview": "What a good book this turned out to be. I wasn't sure what I was going to think of it because it is not a Novel and it is written more as a history of the Civil War from the lives of four women who had strategic roles in the conflict. Each of the four women had different parts to play and they played them to perfection.The book holds your attention by traveling back and forth from one of the four to another. We have the young girl who was a tomboy and as such cut her hair, dressed as a man and joined the Union Army. What she witnessed is just downright awful, the blood, the gore, the severed limbs was overwhelming, but still she persisted.The temptress living in Washington DC and sending notes to the Confederate Army was pretty interesting as well. She appears to have been well known to the Union officials and yet they still went to her home, were seduced and gave up information. Were they really that naive to think she wasn't passing it along?Parts of the book are just hard to read and think that it could have happened the way it did. The brutality of each side against the other. The intentional killing of the wounded without giving any thought to mercy. They stealing and destroying of the land that was so unnecessary and doesn't speak well for the moral's of either side and of the officers that allowed these things to happen.You will be intrigued, amazed, disgusted and drawn in by all that happens in this tale.Enjoy"}, {"userName": "Veronica ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6912850-veronica", "userReview": "This book was so fascinating! I am a huge fan of Erik Larson and his type of non-fiction so I was weary that this wouldn't be that good but boy was it! Karen put a lot of research into this. I loved how you got 4 women with different perspectives (2 were Confederate die hards & the other 2 were Union gals) It really told like a story of all 4 and each chapter left me wanting to read the next chapter, such a page turner! I wish history was this much fun when I was in school!"}], "description": "Karen Abbott, the New York Times bestselling author of Sin in the Second City and \u201cpioneer of sizzle history\u201d (USA Today), tells the spellbinding true story of four women who risked everything to become spies during the Civil War.Karen Abbott illuminates one of the most fascinating yet little known aspects of the Civil War: the stories of four courageous women\u2014a socialite, a farmgirl, an abolitionist, and a widow\u2014who were spies.After shooting a Union soldier in her front hall with a pocket pistol, Belle Boyd became a courier and spy for the Confederate army, using her charms to seduce men on both sides.

The beautiful widow, Rose O\u2019Neale Greenhow, engaged in affairs with powerful Northern politicians to gather intelligence for the Confederacy, and used her young daughter to send information to Southern generals. Elizabeth Van Lew, a wealthy Richmond abolitionist, hid behind her proper Southern manners as she orchestrated a far-reaching espionage ring, right under the noses of suspicious rebel detectives.Using a wealth of primary source material and interviews with the spies\u2019 descendants, Abbott seamlessly weaves the adventures of these four heroines throughout the tumultuous years of the war.
