It makes me want to read more Harry Crews. I'd give it 5 stars but the story line of the character's signature knockout schtick didn't quite sit right with me. It just didn't make sense, or if felt kind of silly to me. Otherwise, I did love the characters and watching many of them sink to the bottom while the main character worked his way up from the depths. Anyway, a nice twisted little tale of depravity and redemption."}, {"userName": "Ken", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/752259-ken", "userReview": "Probably Crews' best work. And the setup for the story couldn't be any better -- a boxer whose only skill is knocking himself out. The opening sequence alone is worth it for this book. I'd put this one above A Feast of Snakes, if for no other reason than Crews' natural tendency towards misogyny, which runs rampant in AFoS, is tampered down here because of the well crafted characters. Jake serves as a natural foil for Charity, whose, for lack of a better term, 'using' of Eugene (and anyone else she can get her claws on) sets up the downward spiral that leads to the book's climax. Along with the boxer Jacques, Jake winds up being one of Euguene's few trustworthy friends, even replacing his longtime friend Pete (the man who first ended Eugene's boxing career). Both Pete and Charity wind up betraying Eugene in their own ways. In spite of the end results, Crews, surprisingly ends the book on a high note -- a final comment on devotion and friendship.One other thread I kept thinking about as I read the book: you can almost read it as a parody of a writer's career, or even Crews' parodying his own literary life. After all, what better way to portray a struggling writer who never quite hit the big leagues and often regretted his status in the literary world than a down-and-out boxer who is only capable of knocking himself out. As Crews himself stated: \"I used to dream when I was as old as twenty-five or twenty-six that one of my novels (of course I'd written four novels by that time which had been rejected), I used to dream while I was asleep this tremendous joy and celebration and the rest of it and then wake up literally humiliated, crushed, depressed, stricken that I was still where I was.\""}, {"userName": "Eden", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/713346-eden", "userReview": "Caveat: I'm a huge Harry Crews fan. I've been hooked on him since I read \"Celebration\" when it was released, then went backwards trying to find every one of his weird little feasts of testosterone and pain. The closest comparison I've ever been able to make has been a cross between John Irving's canon of masculine redemption through physical breach and Carl Hiaason's ludicrously over the top Northern Floridian swampy dark comedy. I wish I liked this book better. It was written while Crews was at the tail end of a 20 year drinking binge, admittedly, and some of the scenes of louche New Orleans seem somehow quaint for all the posturing, but it's still signature Crews. The funny thing is how much it makes me want to read Arthur Nersessian's \"The Fuck Up\" again, though. Same general feeling on the surface of the skin when you're done reading them both."}, {"userName": "wally", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4268560-wally", "userReview": "crews was working on this one while i was attending the university of florida. he read some of this in class, that bit in the lockerroom, where eugene has just lost a fight, his manager comes in, tells him he couldn't even knock himself out.eugene proceeds to coldcock himself, knocking himself out. a star is born. he goes on the circuit. new orleans. some fine american teachers make an appearance. they're special people. heh heh! some others. w/crews, you have folk who have a public appearance, and a very different private appearance, though among friends, that private life is public, shared.this is a joy to read, following eugene from beginnings to a kind of end, to a new kind of a beginning, to and an end, and to a final new beginning, hallelujah, amen.great story."}, {"userName": "Charles White", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3073419-charles-white", "userReview": "This is my favorite Harry Crews novel thus far.

My first full Crews novel (I'd only previously read a long excerpt). Might also be my first real boxing novel.

Themes often include drinking, sex, racism, religion, etc.\"The Knock-out Artist\" spends too much time on the development of a character who has very little character! After all of this, we still do not entirely understand his motives or actions. Furthermore, the story is a bit of a stretch for Crews. (Former boxer becomes freak show and the center of a pyschological study in New Orleans after finding out that he can knock himself out at whim). Crews takes us into the dark and seedy world of New Orleans unsucessfully leaving one unsatisfied.Nope. Dont read this...but I do suggest \"Feast of Snakes\" by Crews.I left this book on a metro train in Washington D.C. after reading it.

I don't know why. I just wasn't into it, or it wasn't working for me, or there was other books I wanted to read more. It sat under my bed for weeks, then I'd take it out, read a few chapters and put it away for another spell of down time. I like Harry Crews' style, I've read some of his other work and thought highly of them. Like I said, I'm not sure why it took me so long to read. Although I have to admit I first thought the plot a little lame - a washed out boxer with a glass jaw knocks himself out for a living. But that's just the surface - the strip club barkers draw to gain the crowd's attention. The book is about a lot more. However it took until I was halfway through to figure that out. Maybe I'm a little dense. Maybe I just didn't like the protagonist. Maybe it just wasn't time until it was time and then it all fell into place."}, {"userName": "wally", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4268560-wally", "userReview": "i was taking a course taught by harry crews, 85-87 thereabouts...and he was working on this one, brought in a few pages from the manuscript, read that bit from the locker-room where the guy's trainer gives him what for after a losing fight....and he knocks himself out, since that is what the trainer (a man who'd been like a father to him) said that he could not do...another story that tries to reconcile the past to the present so that there can be some sort of future.i like how this one ends.there's some wild things happening in new orleans, where the story moves...teachers are precious....a good read!"}, {"userName": "Jamie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51089-jamie", "userReview": "Not my favorite Harry Crews, but mostly that makes me relieved that there is a ceiling to each book of his topping the last.

But, holy shit, some drastic editing would have helped.In a way, I feel like this is what Barry Hannah's classic novella Ray would have been like had Gordon Lish not chopped it almost in half. Crews goes on for a hundred pages to set up a story that ends just as the characters start to turn a corner. Maybe that's what he was going for--a journey and a dark-yet-upward hook at the end--but it's mostly an unenjoyable read. This gimmick of Eugene being a fighter who can knock himself out is the entire basis of the first half of the book. How he resents himself and his lost ways hit hard against the money and staying afloat in the struggling part of New Orleans. Then, it's all but dropped in the second half so Eugene can focus on finding and mentoring a young boxer for a man who is a looming dark, force in Eugene (and the city's) life. Both have the possibility of being interesting stories, but neither are fully told. It appears one way on the surface and another in the guts, but it feels more like two surfaces. After reading Body and enjoying it, I knew there would be detours and tangents and misshapen poetic ramblings that hold bits of charm, but this book comes off much more stylistically flat. I wasn't necessarily going into this expecting a super strong plot, either. Why Body at least makes full use of the competition aspect of the story to simulate, if not enhance, the rising action feel of a plot and The Knockout Artist doesn't, I'll never know. Crews is a good enough writer that, should I have liked the book more, I could easily draw the lines of justification and say why some of his decisions work on another level or two above the text. As it is, though, the supporting characters are thin, Eugene's desires are foggy (just move back home if you miss it so much, you fuck!), and Crews just isn't funny enough here to justify this not being a quirky, mysterious novella."}, {"userName": "Doug", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15906814-doug", "userReview": "I thought the premise was kind of stupid (guy makes a living by knocking himself out), but the story and characters kept me interested, and I like Crews' writing style."}, {"userName": "Kyle", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2600929-kyle", "userReview": "Before this book I'd only read Feast of Snakes by Harry Crews, which I absolutely loved.

I didn't actually read until on a road trip with a group of friends (circa '2001?). I read it aloud to them as we drove up the east coast and all over Mass and New York. I tell you this, because I think it lends to the proof of the entertainment value of this novel. It is certainly a dark novel, with tons of dark humor if you are open to it, otherwise it ends up being a very sad tale of a boxer who will never be able to fulfill his dreams. The elements that I enjoyed the most were the figurative language that is Mr. crews, the attention to detail and the off the wall situations the main character ends up involved in and all for the sake of attempting to do something, anything with what he thought was his skill in life, boxing. A classic choice for any Crews fan, and if you have never read anything by Harry Crews, this is one that will certainly make you want to explore his other writings as well."}, {"userName": "Tom Schulte", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5720805-tom-schulte", "userReview": "A boxer whose only skill is knocking himself out... Outside of this work which takes the skill seriously for the down-on-his luck freak of ahtletic, I have only seen the ploy as a gag. Crews makes it work, which is impressive and especially to me that rarely reads and is less rarely moved to remember modern fiction. Setting the hero\u2019s career in the New Orleans underworld was part of the reason I originally read the work; I then and still now loved the city and its possibilities. From such possibiliites, Crews comjures up the mysterious trainer Jake, perverse tycoon named Oyster Boy; and lover Charity, an earnest psychology graduate student. These are featrues in the city\u2019s decandent and poisonous pool of tawdry sex clubs, fantastic deals, and private parties where every whim is indulged.
