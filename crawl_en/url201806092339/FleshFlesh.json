State secrets? Yeah\u2014they\u2019d be secrets no more. So\u2026when I first heard of \u201cFlesh\u201d in passing, I thought to myself, nuh-uh. But I have to say, once I read the excerpt, I was hooked. Kylie Scott is an author who has an excellent \u201cvoice\u201d. Her prose is clean, witty, and grips you from page 1 and never lets go. Although a post-apocalyptic world is the backdrop of this story, the focus is primarily on the relationships between the heroine Ali and her two men, Daniel and Finn.Did I just say TWO men? Why, yes I did. ;-) Confession #2: I don\u2019t do m\u00e9nage either. At least I THOUGHT I didn\u2019t. But let\u2019s face it, as Daniel aptly puts it, the world has changed, and so have the rules. And as the story unfolded, and I was introduced to these very different, yet equally attractive men, I started to understand how Ali could fall for them both. Daniel is early forties, tall, tattooed and broad shouldered, with baby blues and just a touch of gray peppering his dark hair. Uh, yum! So if you like the whole older man/younger woman thing like me, there ya go.Finn is twenty-something, blond, beautiful, and a bad-ass. He\u2019s got soft green eyes and a take charge attitude, both in bed and out of it. He\u2019s also a few years younger than the heroine Ali, so if you\u2019re into the older woman/younger man scenario, you\u2019re covered too. Something for everyone. The sex is hot, and let me just clarify that although this is a m\u00e9nage, both men are focused solely on Ali and never on each other, if you get my drift. ;-)As for the gore, there are some gory parts, but if you\u2019re like me and hate horror flicks, that may just work in your favor. I found that since my mind doesn't have all these gory images lurking around in there, the bloody parts of the book ended up being somewhat whitewashed and glossed over. I\u2019m not making any guarantees that it will be the same for anyone else, but that\u2019s how it was for me. So, in conclusion, whether you're into \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d or\u2026not, I recommend you give this entertaining erotic romance a try."}, {"userName": "Jilly", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25894509-jilly", "userReview": "A smutty version of \"The Walking Dead\" where Rick and Darryl share a girlfriend.

Erotic zombie post apocalyptic cray-cray....bring it on!!!!************************************************\"Humans are social creatures. I didn't realize how much until nearly everyone was gone.\"Ali has been hiding for months in the upstairs floor of her neighbor's house. (because zombies can't climb) Civilization has crumbled, and she has locked herself away in order to survive. When she goes on one of her rare outings to find food, she runs into Dan. Dan is starved for human companionship...and let's face it, sex. Not a lot of women around after the fall of modern society. (Which is never explained...one BIG question mark!) I loved, love, LOVED Dan! He's just a big lonely, funny, horny guy. He tends to look on the bright side of life, regardless of the situation they're in. Dan's dialogue is so full of one liners, I could probably quote him for pages. \"Tell me I'm right again. Slowly this time. Really draw out the words, play it up for me. Feel free to pant in between if it feels natural.\"and\"Why can't you give me a straight answer?\"\"Why can't you ride me like a pony?\" He scowled straight back at her, unrepentant. \"Don't pretty girls like ponies? I thought they did.\"After Dan convinces Ali that he's not out to rape and pillage, the two decide to stick together. Problem is, Dan is so smitten that he can't seem to keep his mind out of the gutter long enough to protect his female. (insert chest beating here)And in steps Finn. Finn's a younger guy...mid twenties and used to be a cop. He's the serious protector that Dan and Ali need, and Dan somewhat reluctantly accepts his help.I knew going in that this included zombies in a post-apocalyptic world, erotica, and three main characters...hmmm...erotica-->two guys and a girl. Hmmm...wonder what's gonna happen.\"Someone needed to run her out of town, pin a nice big red \"A\" on her chest. Pity the only two people around to see it seemed to be encouraging the behaviour...\"Silly girl! What two guys in a godless, lawless world wouldn't take advantage and tag team your a**? Pulease!!!So I have to be honest, I went into this just wanting something fun and different, which is why I think I enjoyed it so much. It's certainly no life altering story full of deep revelations of the human spirit. But it was fun and fairly fast paced, and sexy as hell! I love post apocalyptic worlds. I love the slight differences that authors use to explain away the zombie virus and how they each portray or barbaric world when we are reduced to mere survival instincts. I think if there was one glaring deletion from this book, it was the world building. I wanted more zombie!!! Ali, Dan, and Finn are immersed in scary, running from zombies and rape-happy groups of men, hiding in high places at night. But other than as a setup for the book, there wasn't a lot of description and explanation. I wish there had been more. More description of the days following the zombie takeover and more of an idea of what the future holds.Despite the lack of wow factor in the world building, I was thoroughly entertained. I don't suggest reading this unless your in the mood for silly and unrealistic. But it was all in good fun, and I'll definitely be moving on to the next book!!"}, {"userName": "Lise *friends don't flag*", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8191340-lise-friends-don-t-flag", "userReview": "I think I have a new favorite genre: Post-Apocalyptic EroticaFlesh is a well-written, witty, action packed and highly erotic story of basic survival and raw gritty love.

She's discovered by Dan and all he can do is think with his lower head and has decided he must have and protect her. He convinces her to set out and find a better place to live and to become his woman. Dan, otherwise known as Alpha-light, and Ally are followed/ stalked by Finn, former cop and otherwise know as Alpha-heavy. Finn, too, wants him some Ally bizniss. To serve and protect. Heavy on the serve. Off they go into the wild blue yonder, fighting zombies and evading and or flat out killing bad people, because this being Dystopia, you know peeps have sunk to new lows. During their journies, they need to contend with this one woman, two men business. Dan pretty much tosses Ally to Finn because, in his brain, she's more likely to survive with two protectors.

It did. For erotica, it's pretty well-written. You expect erotica books to be just snippets of weak story strung together by sex scenes, and there is quite a bit of sex in this book, but the story itself is also engaging, which kinda throws you for a loop, all things considered. The characterization was interesting, though I felt Scott spent more time developing Daniel and Finn than she did on making Ali even remotely sympathetic. I adored Daniel, and Finn was the quintessential alpha, but Ali bugged me a bit. She didn't act 32. I'm 32. I kept thinking Ali was more along the lines of 18-22. The constant references to her \"rabbity\" feelings got a wee bit irritating, as well. Still, I was surprised that I was able to come to grips with the relationship between the three of them. Usually you think relationships like that are doomed to end, and you're sitting there wondering how they can possibly pull it off...but the bond the three of them forge while trying to survive makes their sexual relationship completely plausible to the reader. Scott delivers a scenario that actually makes sense; women are now commodities, highly valued, and a woman having more than one lover is more sane than everything else that's going on in the world.Just keep in mind that this is erotica. If you're looking for deep literature, look elsewhere.

She only leaves to scavenge for supplies. The zombies tend to be lethargic during the day and hunt mostly at night, but there's still other survivors to deal with - roving gangs of violent psychos who are only too happy to fuck shit up.So when she runs into an armed mountain of a man, she's understandably a little freaked.\nShe shrieked every insult known to woman and man, fighting him off with all she had. \u201cYou fucker! You motherfucking cock-sucking asshole. Get your fucking hands off me! Get off me!\u201d\nMeet Daniel! He's thrilled to meet another human survivor, especially of the non-psychopathic variety. Ali doesn't want to make friends, even once she understands Daniel has no interest in hurting her. She hasn't even seen another human in months. Trust isn't exactly second nature to her anymore. Daniel still makes his case with Ali; they are better off having each other to watch each others backs. They need humanity where it is scarce.And if some sexy times happen, that's all well and good too.They need a pack, a family.And who better to round out their little family of survivors than Finn, ex-cop and muscled badass. Who also has a raging boner for Ali. And try as she might, Ali finds her self very attracted to both Daniel's soft care and humor & Finn's ruthless protective instincts.What's a girl to do?If you can't tell already, I really enjoyed this one! It's always hard to find really developed M/F/M relationships in erotica - a lot of times you run into nonstop jealousy or just shallow cardboard characters. This really worked for me, because the characters acknowledge that they might get jealous. They might fight, squabble, have make-up sex, and do it all over again. Daniel's first choice wouldn't be to share Ali. But he likes Finn - and he would be an idiot to send a capable fighter away, especially one who wants to protect his gal.Once it's clear that Ali wants them both, there's no point in fighting it.And I liked Ali's scrappiness! She starts out so scared - her instinct is to hide, not to turn and fight. But she's willing to learn, and she's not about to roll over and die. She's a survivor, whether that means hiding, learning to shoot, or throwing herself down a flight of stairs to escape.\nShe lay there and cried from relief and horror both as the sunset faded and the infected gathered below.\nI did want more zombie action! As is often the case in zombie stories, the humans are more of a threat that the undead people eaters, but they didn't feel quite present enough for me. I wanted to feel that constant threat. Although I will say, that the final 10-15% was quite zombified, and I was pleased.Overall? One of the better eroticas I've read. Certainly the best post-apocalyptic, end of civilization, menage, Australian, zombie erotica I've found.

Grrr, I was so damn sure I was going to love this book. I don't really know what happened to be honest. I kept finding myself skimming here and there too, which is never a good thing. I wanted to rate this book higher, but as my problems with it piled higher and higher, I just couldn't. I have to be honest. What I absolutely adored about this book was Daniel. He's such an amazing guy. I loved how he called Ali 'his girl'. *swoon* I couldn't really see why he was so attracted to her really, bar the fact that she's the only woman he's come across in two months, there wasn't anything outstnading about her. Dan was so wonderfully sweet, bursting with excitement at just having someone to talk to again. My happiness was short lived because then Finn came along. Finn was/is a cop, who's 15 years younger than Dan (41) and seemed like an arrogant prick. I was right, he is. He was following Dan and Ali around for days, ranting on about how he could protect the woman (Ali) better than this guy. Then within ten minutes of meeting her, he's mooning at her and calling her 'Al' which annoyed the shit out of me. Who gives someone a nickname after knowing them for half an hour? Also her name's Ali, is there really any need to shorten it? The sex scenes were good, but not out of this world. Then there's the condom issue.  They're getting all hot and sweaty and I'm having this long-arse conversation in my head... don't laugh ;)Wow, if it's the apocalypse then I guess people priorities have changed, I doubt people are carrying condoms around in their wallets or pockets anymore. And I doubt the chemist is open now so the pill's out too. What would you do from now on then? I guess you'd just have to pull out and hope for the best, no?  But wait, what? Oh okay, he has a condom in his bag? Phew, what a relief.It's a little unbelievable. When packing a bag of only the most important things that could possibly end up saving your life, I doubt condoms are at the top of said list. This happens repeatedly throughout the book and it doesn't get any less annoying. The m\u00e9nage relationship just felt... wrong! I pride myself on being very open-minded. The thought of three people in a relationship doesn't bother me at all. It was the way that Finn completely shit Dan out and vice versa. It made the scenes very uncomfortable for me to read :( Towards the end of the book the action really picked up, which was fantastic. The very last sex scene of the book was amazing. Dan and Finn were so much more comfortable and relaxed around each other. But then it was ruined by this... They're planning a baby or she might already be pregnant. What the hell? One, they've hardly been together a few months by this point and are barley a functioning threesome. Also, bringing a baby into a post-apocalyptic world, where zombies are roaming, feasting on human flesh? What a wonderful place to raise a baby? Stupid! I feel so awful, ranting about this book when there were some really great things about it too.

I've never read anything by Kylie Scott before but I'm so glad I read this one. I love the show The Walking Dead and the season just ended so I'm going through withdrawal. From the sound of this story it sounded like walking dead with sex and it kinda is. Very cool \"Zombie Apocalypse\" type story (although in the story they're called \"infected\" not Zombies). The story starts out with Dan and Ali meeting. It doesn't go well at first because all Ali wants to do is hide. She's been hiding for weeks and has seen stuff the survivors have done that makes her wary of trusting anyone. Dan has been lonely for human contact and falls head over heals for Ali as soon as he sees her. He's determined to stay with her and protect her and wants to find a place to settle in more rural areas to avoid the \"infected\". Dan and Ali end up running in to some bad guys while foraging for food and end up in danger and in walks Finn to help them out.I wasn't sure if I was going to like Finn at first... He wanted Ali for himself and was planning to woo her away from Dan. Finn felt Dan wasn't able to take care of her well enough and that he was the better choice. Problem is that she has feelings for Dan and wasn't going to just drop him. Dan sees that Ali would be safer with both of them. He's not happy with the thought of sharing her but is willing to do it to keep her safe and happy. They run in to trouble in their travels and Ali has to deal with the men and if she's willing to be shared while they're fighting for survival. There's a pretty good action plot line with a couple different twists. I really liked how the relationship between Ali, Dan and Finn worked out. Finn came around so I liked him more and all three start working together and making a family with each other. It wasn't smooth but it felt more real because it wasn't. The story does end on a HEA note with them relatively safe and happy together.I really loved this book and had bought the second in the series before I was even done reading this one (I'll be starting it in about 10 minutes :D ). I'd highly recommend this story. 2 thumbs up! :D2/14/15 - I just completed a reread of the story. I still think it's a great story. It's not a perfect story but it's well written and I really liked the characters (although Finn took a bit to warm up to) and the plot.

Can she trust the intentions of the two hot strangers Daniel and Finn that she is forced to travel with on the road to safety?When I think of erotica zombies are the last thing that come to mind, so wasn't sure what to expect with this. I'm also not a big fan of m\u00e9nage storylines in general, but being a fan of the Walking Dead and Resident Evil made the premise intriguing. Surprisingly this worked on a lot of different levels. The way this m\u00e9nage relationship developed between strangers was so believable to me. I really liked that the female was really the focus of these guys, and not just a conduit for homoerotic subtext. Of course none of that is supposed to seem gay, which is the usual tone of books with this theme. The zombie chaos lends itself to why this unconventional relationship is being played out.If you are sick of werewolves and vampire storylines in your Urban Fantasy, this is definitely worth a try."}, {"userName": "Denise ~The Procrastinating Book Diva~", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4133839-denise-the-procrastinating-book-diva", "userReview": "3.5 ~ 4 stars\nWho would have thought a book featuring a m\u00e9nage relationship set in post apocalyptic Australia with zombies running amok would work? Well until I read Flesh definitely not me!! However, in my never ending quest to find a read off the beaten path I decided to give it a try and I\u2019m so glad I did.Flesh is well written, surprisingly funny (mostly due to hero Daniel\u2019s witty banter and snarky comments), and emotionally charged. It comes across as a much steamier version of Walking Dead yet just as gritty. When not tangled in the sheets with one or both of the sexy heroes, Ali was vulnerability, strength, and tenacity personified. Her men, Daniel and Finn, were resourceful and utterly devoted to her care and safety. The author did an excellent job of showcasing the intricacies of their m\u00e9nage making the relationship fairly believable even under the most unbelievable circumstances. At times the ease with which Daniel accepted and encouraged Ali's relationship with Finn bordered on incredulous, nonetheless, his lighthearted way of coping highlighted the need to adjust beliefs and expectations in order to survive as the world he once knew crumbled. Unfortunately all of the fighting for their lives and attempts at rebuilding civilization left little room for character development but with such weighty issues at stake I decided the author deserved a pass :)So while not perfect, Flesh definitely satisfied my craving for something different.

All the people she knew are either dead or transformed and she has no idea how many reliable people she would find, if she finally left the house.Turns out that they find her. First time she leaves the attic, she meets Daniel.Now, Daniel is a horny alpha guy. Not the possessive jerk kind of alpha guy. In his forties and divorced, he's a self-assured, attractive, funny man and in desperate need of woman.You'd expect him to jump Ali as soon as she lets her guard down, and according to his desperately dirty thoughts, he would. But he's better than that (thank god!) and his is like love at first sight, so he decides to earn Ali's trust and slowly make her fall for him, instead of acting like the mindless caveman we're used to read about.Ali is an amazing protagonist. She's obviosuly afraid of Dan. She doesn't know exactly what to expect from him. She's seen women being raped by criminals and isn't so naive to really believe the man, when he first tries to assure her. He won't touch her, unless she tells him to. All he asks is her company and her words.He craves human connection and deep down so does Ali, despite how little she trusts strangers.Their relationship develops fast: they both need something from each other that trascends primal insticts. Being alone for so much time has taken its toll on them. Being on the run or hidden inside a secluded room has taken a little bit of humanity from them. They've forgotten how good it felt to have a conversation with another human being, laugh, look at the sky, hope again.And their interaction inevitably leads to sex and love.That's when the book went downhill for me.They go looking for supplies, find themselves cornered by a band of criminals whose intentions are all but noble towards Ali and are rescued by a former cop named Finn.Finn is a cool guy and all. More than that, actually. He's adorable and really mature for a young man in his twenties. But while I was expecting (rather enthusiastically, I'd say) his involment in Ali and Dan's sex life, I didn't like the outcome of that.Dan realizes he wasn't good enough to protect his woman. So starts talking Ali into accepting Finn into their lives (and bed). He all but hints at the fact that if she sleeps with Finn and keeps him \"happy\", he'd keep protecting her.So Ali's attraction and decision to have sex with the younger man feels unnatural and rushed. It's like she's whoring herself to be rescued any time she's in need and I totally hated that.Moreover, it's like Finn becomes her favorite of the two men and he's also the first she confesses her love to.It's not a matter of finding hard to believe that a woman could love two men at the same time. I won't turn this into an hypocritical debate about what people should or shouldn't do in their life.I just found it hard to accept that Ali would fall in love so easily and quickly with a guy she barely considered until a day before. And right after she said she saw Dan as her boyfriend.It didn't work for me, the same way the ending didn't.I found myself skipping a lot of the book, only to end up reading of the three of them considering the idea of having a baby. In a post-apocaliptic world where they can barely survive themselves...Erotica and babies aren't a required and necessary binomial, in my opinion.One doesn't exclude the other, but doesn't even imply it.That was a great premise and a great first half of the book. Too bad it had to follow more \"clich\u00e9d\" and popular dymanics."}, {"userName": "Andrea \u2764Ninja Bunneh\u2764", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7897213-andrea-ninja-bunneh", "userReview": "If you are reading this and don't have a pervy heart, back slowly away from this review.Now, if you were surviving the zombie apocalypse what would you want?

It took me about 4 heartbeats to be completely engrossed; it was bizarre, enchanting, steamy, scary, and totally ridiculous. \nI think the part I found the most enthralling (aside from all the sex and being chased by zombies) is how quickly I accepted the world Ali is in and the rules in which they are living.

It was well written but I just never really liked any of the characters except for Daniel. Ali was just a little too immature and her \"rabbit\" heart got old after awhile and I never liked Finn. He was arrogant and entitled and I didn't like the way he treated Daniel. The world building was just okay - I kept picturing \"The Walking Dead' since this book described a world A LOT like that series. At first, I thought I was going to like/get the menage plot, after all Daniel had good reasons for wanting Finn to be invested in Ali's safety/life. The problem I had was threefold: At first Daniel knows this is best for Ali but doesn't like the thought of sharing her at all and then all of a sudden he's fine with it (What happened - how did he get to this point?). The second is Ali who doesn't want to get involved with Finn at first because she loves Daniel and then all of a sudden she's not only totally on board but she's in love with Finn as well. And finally, this was more Ali having a sexual relationship with two different men, not really the three of them in a relationship together. At the very end, there is a scene where they are all together but by that point I just didn't buy it. I also thought that the \"love\" came WAY TO QUICK\". Daniel and Ali were in love within days of meeting and Ali and Finn also within days of his joining them. I think the book would have been better if the author had stuck to the \"need\" aspect vs love. Anyway, between my dislike of Finn and the instant love (I didn't even mention the fact that they always had condoms even though it's an apocalypse) I just can't give this book more than 2 stars."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3063495-jennifer", "userReview": "I did not expect to enjoy FLESH as much as I did.

Story had good pacing, multiple POV, drew me in, felt real, WAS NOT disjointed, didn't have cheesy lines. Thank you Kylie Scott.I think most of the reviewers who gave lower ratings, did so for personal preferences. They even said so.Not everyone likes menage. If they do, only certain types. I perfectly ok with menage where not all parties are sexually involved with one another. FLESH is two guys loving one woman.Some reviewers thought Al was too wimpy. For me, she was perfect; I'm not a big fan of the female \"bad ass\" characters. Again...a personal preference.Some thought Finn was a jerk. Yes, he was for a bit. But not too such an extend where I couldn't enjoy him growing into the relationship.And Dan? Well, I think everyone loves Dan. Uber masculine sensitive type.Zombie apocalypse? Ms. Scott gave me just the write amount of action and tension. Enough to be superbly enjoyable and not so much that I wanted to tear my hair out.Finally, the relationship between Al, Dan and Finn.

A mutant virus was unleashed upon the world and humanity was reduced to the walking dead - zombies who only lived to kill and destroy other humans. Small groups of people, immune for reasons we don't yet know, survived the viral outbreak and live hand to mouth, trying to stay one step ahead of the horde - and those who have used this world changing event to reek havoc and misery upon others. Ali has been hiding in an attic for the last 8 weeks. During a trip \"outside\" to forage for supplies, she meets up with Daniel. Sparks fly but not the romantic kind - she has been alone so long (and fearful for so long) that she doesn't trust him not to hurt her. It takes quite a bit of persuasion to finally allow her to see that Daniel only wants companionship. Being alone by choice is one thing, but it was the being alone caused by the end of the world that set Daniel, a loner, on a new course. He convinces her they need to get to the open countryside and begin a new life of self sufficiency, farming and making do. The cities are too dangerous. While en route to this unknown nirvana, they are saved from a gang of murderous thugs by Finn, also on his own. Finn is a bad ass motherf*cker - no two ways about it. He is the quintessential alpha/gamma male, former cop and all around man you don't want to mess with. They join up and continue to head for parts unknown and hopefully safety.Daniel is 41, Ali is 32 and Finn 26. You're able to see the differences in thinking between Daniel and Finn right away due to age. Not that Daniel is an old guy, but he feels older than 41. Daniel and Ali hook up romantically and eventually Ali and Finn, but it's never a true threesome - which I'm glad for. Ali is different with each man - subdued with Daniel and erotic with Finn. They each bring out something different in her. The dynamics aren't all hunky dory though, not by a long shot. Daniel is willing to share Ali because he knows she needs protecting and he knows he can't do it alone. Finn doesn't want to share and knows he CAN protect Ali and needs no help from Daniel. There are some tense moments but eventually it seems to be worked out in an acceptable way for everyone involved. Daniel as I said seems older than his 41 years. He's straddling the beta/alpha line tenuously. I would say he fits more into a beta position but with strength and agility to his credit. Finn is 120% alpha/gamma male and makes no apologies. I was completely in the Finn camp from page one of his appearance. The only reason I'm giving this a less than 5 star review is Ali. She has moments of stupidity that just made me want to scream and pull my hair out.

One thing I've learned about erotic books is that they're more sexy and less plot, in which I have no complain if you're wantin' some hot lovin'. Just to be clear, our protags are not zombies. In fact, they're most definitely alive who enjoys orgy. Note that these are a lady gone out of hiding from an attic; a middle-aged dude that vows to protect said lady; and a hot police officer who develops attraction to again.. said lady. Just imagine the love/hate of these boys in want possession with the girl. But it turns out totally different. Kinkiness, when it comes to sexual activity, kind of bothers me for the reason that I think it's radical. Being a huge believer in monogamy, I should have despised the thought of having two partners but given their circumstances, not only did I make an exception but the portrayal -- their attachment among another -- is worth the sexy endeavor they have. The point that Ali depends so much on Daniel and Finn exterminates the idea of choosing which a more suitable companion. I love to think of them less being a jerk and a lot more aggressively dignified. On to the story. So I said I didn't expect much action and adventure given erotic reference. Again, this took me by surprise. Despite this being an adult book, the zombie adventure reads more of a Young Adult with all the running, screaming, hiding, and fighting for survival. The story doesn't stray about what and how a post-apocalyptic, zombie infestation should have. So surprise, surprise that I really enjoyed this one so much! It's fast-paced with equal parts adventure and hot romance like other YA-P/A stories out there. I'm not surprised that the author is Australian because their form of writing is very good and them being an exceptional story teller. The love scenes (yes, love!) is very romantic and sweet so another surprise there. And now that I think about it, what's hotter with a sexy man doing you but two of them.
