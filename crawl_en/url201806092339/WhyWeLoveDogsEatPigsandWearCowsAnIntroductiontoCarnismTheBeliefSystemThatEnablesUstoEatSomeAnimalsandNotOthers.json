It\u2019s a slim book but it contains a lot of food for thought.I felt as though I were back in a college psychology class because my mind was being stimulated in just the way it was during some of those classes. It\u2019s written in a very reader friendly manner and even though there\u2019s a lot of terminology that might not be familiar to all readers, it doesn\u2019t use a lot of jargon, it\u2019s written so that any unfamiliar words will have a clear meaning with the reading of them. Melanie Joy has coined the word carnism and I really like that the word is now in the vernacular.The book is definitely written for and directed at the carnists, the vast majority of the population who accepts the dominant paradigm; those living as omnivores. However, vegetarians and vegans can also learn a lot from this book.Unless I\u2019m reading for a class of some sort, I rarely take notes when I read books for pleasure or edification, but I took many notes here. I\u2019m going to leave most of them out of this review. I don\u2019t want to just regurgitate the book\u2019s contents here. I want readers to read the book for themselves.This is a psychology and philosophy book and the author\u2019s musings and hypotheses were what interested me most. I cared less for the material about the atrocities committed against farmed animals. However, I because I do believe the author was writing for those who\u2019d maybe never questioned they way things are, that information might be necessary to put what she is saying into context, and it actually makes up a rather small part of the book. I really do love her though!: She specifically says that once we know the full extent and all the details of the suffering of animals, we no longer need to continually expose ourselves to graphic imagery in order to work on their behalf. Thank goodness! I\u2019ve been reading what\u2019s what for over two decades and sometimes it\u2019s just too painful for me to put my focus on the specifics of what goes on.I love the one or two quotes that start off each chapter; they\u2019re so apt. I liked them so much so that I put a few of them in my Goodreads quotes. For Americans who truly cannot care about the 20 billion animals killed for food in the U.S. every year, or even care about the devastation caused to the environment, the 300 million (human) animals might get their attention. I love how the author refers to these 300 million as the collateral damage of carnism: the factory farm workers, those who live near factory farms, and those who eat animal flesh.Most people like to believe that they make their own choices, and that they\u2019re in control of how they act. I\u2019d like to challenge them to read this book because the author talks about how the pervasive and violent ideology of carnism is the norm, how most believe without questioning, how the system is set up so that much of the truth is hidden from the population, and how this system is so entrenched that it\u2019s just the way things are, and most aren\u2019t even aware of their philosophy or aware they even have a philosophy. Vegetarianism has been named because those people are doing something different. Carnism was never named because those people are just doing what everybody does. It\u2019s invisible, legitimized, and unnamed until now. The author writes about how every aspect of society, not just those making money off the killing of animals, goes along with this ideology of carnism, including the legal system and the news media. The system depends on its invisibility, on myth, on conformity, on objectification, deindividulization, dichotomization of the animals, and on confirmation bias, where people get fed what they already believe.She contends that most people feel better if they attain integration, a state where their values and practices are in alignment, that most people are actually disgusted by what they think of as moral offenses, that in order to do what they\u2019re doing as carnists dissociation and denial are widespread, because while society believes eating meat is normal, natural, and necessary, those aren\u2019t really facts.Studies have shown (she uses Stanley Milgram\u2019s experiments as an example) that people will sometimes not obey their own consciences but will cede to those in authority. Joy encourages her readers to question that external authority and question the status quo, and pay attention to their own internal authority. The book ends on a very hopeful note. The author believes that not only can we change and that the time is right for change, but that the vast majority of people would be more comfortable with their values and actions matching. So she believes that people can change and will want to change when they learn the truth. She gives some of those truths in this book. The reader can decide for herself/himself what to make of the information.At the end of the book there is a list of useful resources, notes, a bibliography, and an index.The way I figure it, even those people who are certain that they will want to eat animals their whole lives will appreciate this book. The ideas she proposes here can be generalized to all sorts of subjects, at least some that every reader will find beneficial to contemplate."}, {"userName": "Jesse De Angelis", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11316358-jesse-de-angelis", "userReview": "This book is kind of a mess. It's filled with baseless generalizations, poorly cited data, and spends most of its length talking not about what the title promises, but rather an attack on industrialized animal agriculture. The book starts out with a \"thought experiment\" - you're at a dinner party, when the host suddenly reveals the delicious stew you're eating is made of dog. Clearly, you are horrified. If you're not, well, the author doesn't know what to do, so she offers this footnote, dismissing anyone on the other side of the issue whose views are different from how she imagines them: \"Although some individuals may be intrigued rather than repulsed at the idea of eating dogs, in the United States these people represent a minority, and this book describes the experiences of Americans in general.\"[12] Ugh. later, in a bizarrely formatted side bar, she quotes but doesn't contextualize or really investigate an article published by the  Telegraph , which discusses the dog meat trade in South Korea. In the same side bar, she presents the comments of \"bloggers\" - meaning people who commented on an article on the ASPCA's website. The inclusion of the comments is pretty odd, since they don't exactly add anything to the discussion, although the author claims \"the bloggers give voice to what many people feel when they become aware of animal cruelty.\"[69] Apparently, these feelings include a bunch of racism: \"[I]'ve seen cruelty from all around the world, but the far east is truly shocking in its attitude towards animals...why is this? [M]y theory is cos [sic] they know the enlightened west generally gives dogs/cats the respect they deserve, and their backward societys[sic] are unwilling to catch up.\" [70]The author never comments on this after quoting it, which is obviously a little problematic. Are we supposed to be like \"woah, even racists care about dogs/cats,\" or is this being presented as a reasonable response to eating animals? Either way, ugh. Also, none of the authors/\"bloggers\" of these comments are actually listed in the notes at the end of the book, only the main article that it seems like they are commenting on; this is pretty lazy and potentially confusing for readers. Also anyone who compares the [totally horrible] conditions of factory farms or the eating of meat to actual genocide is a dishonest asshole, so there's that. If you're interested in meat eating/the meat industry, there are better books out there, many of which the author quotes liberally from. Check out Fast Food Nation by Eric Schlosser or  The Omnivore's Dillema  by Michael Pollan, and if you're in the mood for a radical take on the ethics of eating meat, check out  The Sexual Politics of Meat by Carol J. Adams. If you want to read the book that actually goes with the title of this one, though, I'm not sure what to suggest."}, {"userName": "Tierney", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/955237-tierney", "userReview": "This book changed my life. Though I was familiar with many of the facts presented in the book (the perils of factory farming, etc.), I had no idea just how much cruelty and torture is endured by most of the animals who become our meat. Nor did I have any clue how intelligent and sensitive many \"livestock\" animals really are (especially pigs). As an animal lover, and a meat lover, I felt very conflicted while reading. But the author effectively points out the absurdity of our cultural attitudes towards animals - we love our pets as much as family members, but we turn a blind eye to the cruelty suffered by other animals all in the name of our taste. In our modern society, we don't have to eat meat, we choose to eat meat, and there are consequences for those choices that we don't want to think about. I'm making a conscious effort to eat a meat-free diet as a result of reading this book."}, {"userName": "Lis Carey", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey", "userReview": "Melanie Joy is the leading researcher in the field of carnism, a field she invented. If that sounds a tad catty, sorry, but I'm laboring under the burden of having actually read her book.Dr. Joy purports to give us a thoroughly researched discussion of the psychology of why we eat meat, and why we eat some animals and not other animals. This book has gotten a lot of praise, for it's fairness and respectful attitude towards people who eat meat. I'm honestly mystified by that praise. The assumption of the moral superiority of veganism is quite clear. It's true she does assume that us carnists are doing it because we're bad people. No, she assumes it's because we don't know any better, are ignorant, brainwashed, and perhaps not very bright. This book is poorly researched, poorly reasoned, and overall pretty silly.One of the sillier and more annoying features of the book is her effort, repeated throughout the book, to suggest that eating meat is not natural--despite the fact that she concedes our ancestors have been doing it for two million years. Despite the fact that we've been eating meat since before we were fully human, we only eat meat because of an \"ideology of carnism.\" Really? I want to read her explanation of how this \"ideology of carnism\" arose in Homo erectus, or among the tribes of chimpanzees who hunt, kill, and eat monkeys whenever they get the chance.Saying that something our ancestors have been doing for two million years, since before we were fully human, is \"not natural\" is to strip the word \"natural\" of all meaning.On the \"lack of respect\" point, I think it's rather hard to overlook the quotes used throughout the book, many about Nazis and how they treated the people they considered subhuman, some about slavery, some about misogyny. You're not being \"respectful\" when you imply that the people who disagree with you are like the Nazis. On the internet, that would be called a \"Godwin violation\" and the discussion would shut down. And I'll note an amusing little irony: Hitler was a vegetarian, and very concerned about humane treatment of animals. Does that make vegetarians bad? Does it make them like Nazis? Of course not! Nazis have nothing to do with this discussion, and it's a mistake for Dr. Joy to pretend that they do.One of her basic points is that we perceive some animals as food, and some animals as family members, and still others as just icky. (\"Icky\" is my word, not hers.) In America, she says, we eat cows, and pigs, and chickens, because we perceive them differently than we perceive dogs. If only we were not so deluded and confused, we'd see that this difference in perception is silly, and that dogs, cows, pigs, and chickens are all really the same, sentient beings with feelings and identity. In Dr. Joy's view, it's all false perception on our part, and while she does not quite come out and use the phrase, \"a rat is a dog is a boy,\" it's implied very strongly. There's no moral difference between eating a cow and eating a human being.She also makes a big point of the fact that different cultures class different animals in the \"animals we eat\" and \"animals we love\" categories, implying that this proves the inherent invalidity of classing any animals as \"okay to eat.\"No, sorry, not true. We perceive dogs and cows and chickens differently because our relationships with them are different. Our relationships with them are very different because the animals themselves are very different. Dogs evolved out of wolves because early humans and early, proto-dog wolves had both similar social structures and complementary abilities and needs. Humans created middens of the bits of both plants and animals that were not edible to them but were edible to hungry wolves; the wolf proto-dogs who followed the human hunter-gatherer bands had better scent, hearing, and night vision, and raised the alarm when critters (human, wolf, or other) that weren't part of the established and recognized band. Everyone was better off, a little better fed and a little safer, and this evolved into a human-dog partnership--starting at least 14,000 years ago, and possibly, depending on which body of evidence and which reasoning about it you find most convincing, 250,000 years ago. If the extreme early date is at all accurate, proto-dog wolves starting partnering up with us when we were still making the transition from Homo erectus to Homo sapiens. If the latest, most recent date is correct, it was still while we were paleolithic hunter-gatherers with the beginnings of agriculture still thousands of years in our future.Cows, on the other hand, evolved out of wild cattle that our ancestors hunted for food.It's quite true that different cultures have different relationships with the same animals. Hindus don't eat cows; they revere them. Jews and Muslims don't eat pigs; they regard them as unclean. In China and Korea, and Dr. Joy somewhat gleefully tells us, people do eat dogs. She does note that in Korea, as more people keep dogs as pets, there's a growing movement to ban eating dogs.What I think she's missing is that these differences are not random or accidental. Differences in food preferences and beliefs about food don't just happen. Judaism has some complex food rules that had the cultural benefit of differentiating them from their neighbors and keeping a small culture intact and cohesive, but the ban on pigs is different. There are real ecological reasons for pastoralist and subsistence agricultural cultures in the Middle East to avoid keeping pigs, no matter how tasty they are. That's why Muslims and Jews share that ban. (Note: I am talking about the practical origins, not the religious meaning it has to practicing believers.)As for dogs and the eating and non-eating thereof: Even large dogs are much smaller than cows or pigs or horses, on the one hand, and not nearly as prolific and quickly-maturing as chickens. They're not an economic source of food, and they are eaten, where they are eaten, either as a delicacy or out of desperation.Another area of silliness is her claim that we use different words for live animals (sheep, cows, pigs) and for the same animals when we eat them (mutton, beef, pork.) A minimal effort at research would have revealed to her--something she probably already knows, if she just stopped to think about it. This vocabulary difference comes from post-Norman Conquest England, where English peasants raised cows, pigs, and sheep, and talked about them in their own English language, while the meat was eaten by the Norman overlords--who spoke French. This vocabulary difference doesn't exist in, at least, most Western languages.Meanwhile, Dr. Joy is overlooking two little details that undermine her point even without the linguistic history. First, when we eat chickens, we normally refer to the meat as \"chicken.\" The same is true of turkeys and turkey. Rather an odd discrepancy, if the word differences have the \"purpose\" of making us forget that the meat on our plates used to be live animals. The other point is that, while the English eat mutton--the meat of adult sheep--Americans rarely do. When Americans eat the meat of sheep, we eat the meat of baby sheep--lambs. And we call that meat \"lamb.\" Lamb chops. Leg of lamb. Rack of lamb.It's hard to look at that fact and claim we're trying to hide the truth from ourselves because we couldn't bear to eat them otherwise.Where her book is stronger is on the abuses of our meat production industry. Factory farming of cows, chickens, pigs, and sheep has produced terrible abuses, imperfectly and often ineffectively \"regulated\" by a USDA that is essentially a captive agency, charge with both regulating the industry and promoting its products. The conditions in factory farms are often appalling, and a typical slaughterhouse can be horrific. Our food animals generally don't live normal lives, and despite regulations intended to prevent it, often die in terror and pain. I try to make the best choices I can on the source of my food; I know people who are vegetarians, or effectively vegetarians, because they can't afford meat that meets their standards for humane production. This is a real issue. Our tax dollars are going to \"farm\" subsidies that in reality promote CAFOs (concentrated animal feeding operations) that are abnormal and unhealthy for the animals, compromise the safety of our food supply, and create environment-destroying pollution from runoff of animal waste and chemicals on a scale more traditional manufacturing factories are no longer permitted to do. There is absolutely nothing positive to be said about CAFOs; whether from animal welfare, human nutrition, or environmental safety, they're bad news.Stop the subsidies, stop tilting the playing field in favor of these travesties, and our food would cost a bit more, but be dramatically healthier and more secure, while our environment would suffer much less damage.But this brings us back to another silly claim: that locking up food production behind walls where most of us never see how our food animals are treated makes it easier for us to eat meat without picturing the live animals it came from and thereby being repelled by it. It seems a superficially reasonable argument, but it stumbles on reality. If this argument were correct, there should be more people eating meat, and eating more of it, than in past generations, most of human history, when people lived side by side with their food animals, their cattle, their sheep, their chickens, their pigs, when every animal was an individual, usually with a name. Or else deer and pheasants and rabbits were hunted, and had to be killed by the hunter and butchered by him or his wife so that they could eat. Vegetarianism should be on the decline, if Dr. Joy were correct about this.But vegetarianism and veganism are on the rise, not on the decline. I think it's because people know, at a gut level, that there's something wrong with not knowing how your food animals are raised. We evolved as a species that knew, in the most visceral possible way, that the meat we ate came from living animals who valued their lives as much as we value our own. Most cultures have had rituals to respect the life of the animal killed, and the sacrifice being made when that life is taken to provide food for the humans. The reason we have more vegetarians and vegans, and many people who still eat meat eat less than they would have in the past, is because it's abnormal for meat to come in neatly wrapped packages bearing no resemblance to a living animal, and we know intuitively the dangers of not knowing how your food is raised. It's why urban farming is on the rise--the natural human drive to not be so disconnected from your food, and unaware of the lives of the animals you eat.I cannot recommend this book, except for the advantages of knowing what otherwise-sensible people are saying and thinking.I purchased this book."}, {"userName": "Virginia Messina", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/307041-virginia-messina", "userReview": "This is an enlightening book for anyone interested in the psychological and social mechanisms that behind certain food choices. It's based on the author's doctoral research in psychology--but is highly readable and engaging. Melanie Joy coined the term carnism to describe the belief system that sees eating certain animals as ethical and appropriate. She describes the elaborate system that has evolved to keep consumers from actually examining their food choices. As long as we care about animal suffering and also continue to eat animals, she says, \u201cour schema will distort our perceptions of animals and the meat we eat so that we can feel comfortable enough to consume them.\u201dSo why has vegetarianism, widely accepted as a belief system, been named while carnism has not? One reason is that carnism is the norm in our society. It\u2019s mainstream\u2014which is simply a way of describing an ideology that is so widespread and entrenched that its practices are regarded as \u201ccommon sense.\u201d Ideologies that fall outside the mainstream\u2014like vegetarianism\u2014on the other hand, are easier to recognize. Much more importantly, though, the way in which entrenched ideologies remain entrenched is by staying invisible. And the primary way in which they stay invisible is by staying unnamed. By choosing not to name the belief system, consumers are able to avoid the hard questions that it raises. This symbolic invisibility is further supported by practical invisibility. The agricultural industry goes to great lengths to protect the secrets of how animals are raised for food on modern factory \u201cfarms.\u201d The system is necessarily cruel because, from a business standpoint, animal welfare is a barrier to profit. Agriculturists don\u2019t want consumers to see these cruelties, nor do consumers want to see them. Still, there are discrepancies between consumers\u2019 beliefs and behaviors, and one way to avoid the associated moral discomfort is to embrace what Joy calls the three Ns of justification: eating meat is normal, natural, and necessary. Anyone with any sense of history, especially as it pertains to social justice movements, knows that these are the exact justifications that have been used to support all exploitive systems, including African slavery and efforts to deny voting rights to women. Joy identifies the cognitive defenses that carnists employ, and suggests that, because empathy appears to be hardwired in our brains, carnistic defenses may actually go against our nature. We cannot be wholly integrated if we care about animals but support widespread animal cruelty. There are ways to close the gap between values and behavior, which involve questioning the status quo and external authority. The author is honest about the difficulties of doing that, but encouraging about the benefits to the individual, and practical in her recommendations. Here\u2019s the sad\u2014and frustrating\u2014thing, though. The same elaborate system of cognitive defense that supports carnism will keep most carnists from ever picking up this book."}, {"userName": "Steve", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2116837-steve", "userReview": "Dr. Melanie Joy is a psychologist and this book is about the psychology of using animals for food. Her main message is that using animals for food involves holding cultural beliefs that many people are not aware of. The book is intelligent and respectful to all types of people. It illuminates why it is often hard for people to give up using animals for food despite the strongly negative ethical, health and environmental consequences involved. In this respect I think it is very useful for people who have been animal rights activists for a long time who feel flabbergasted at why people \"just don't get it\" and change their diets after being given a single leaflet.In exploring the psychology of using animals for food Dr. Joy makes powerful arguments for not doing so. Joy does so in a sober, intelligent way that would appeal mostly to reflective people. I wish I could go vegan again and go vegan from having read this book in that regard.What was disappointing about this book was that Dr. Joy didn't have much to say about using the knowledge of the psychology presented to be more effective in convincing people to stop using animals for food. Dr. Joy offers only two suggestions. Make the invisible beliefs visible by naming the beliefs ( \"carnism\" ) and bringing the facts of eating animals into plain view that are normally hidden."}, {"userName": "Christina", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/565777-christina", "userReview": "When I read non-fiction, I read it very differently from reading fiction. And when I read a book like this about animal ethics, about vegetarianism and how to stop eating meat, I try to read it very carefully and I try keep my emotions out of it - which is very hard when reading about how we treat animals, even though this is a decent book without a lot of emotional blackmailing.I'll just mention before anybody reads further, that there will be a few graphic details in the review below so be forewarned.Melanie Joy's point with this book is to try and investigate and explain why we are comfortable eating some animals and not others. Why do most of us feel okay with eating a cow but not a dog. Why do we feel so bad when we hear about how they treat dogs in Asia before they eat them but don't care how pigs are treated before we eat them?To explain this, Joy introduces the term 'carnism' as the opposite of vegetarianism, meaning people who have decided to eat meat: \"We eat animals without thinking about what we are doing and why because the belief system that underlies this behavior is invisible. This invisible belief system is what I call carnism. Carnism is the belief system in which eating certain animals is considered ethical and appropriate.\" (p. 29-30).Our view on different animals is all about perception - how we perceive these animals determines how we treat them. We perceive dogs almost as persons so therefore we of course can't eat them. But pigs for instance, we perceive as being dirty stupid animals, so we don't care about eating them. This also means that when eating a pig, we don't imagine a cute little piggy playing with other small piglets but if we were told we were eating dog, we would immediately think of a cute dog running and playing on the grass. It's all about perception.But if we suddenly imagined a cute calf when eating veal, would we be able to continue eating? Most people probably wouldn't - even though we divide animals into edible and inedible and cows are classified as edible. Joy's claim is that if we imagine the animals classified as edible as real living individual animals while eating them, then we will think differently about eating them because even though we are supposed to like eating cows for instance, the image of the actual animal might destroy this learned preference. That's also why we talk about eating beef and not eating cow, to hide what we're actually eating. We objectify animals, we de-individualize them and we dichotomize (classify them as edible and inedible) them - as well as think that it's normal, necessary and natural to eat animals.Joy has a good point when she mentions that we only like to eat a very few types of animals and feel disgusted at eating the rest - and she thinks that our lack of disgust is at least somewhat learned. And with the lack of disgust disappears also our empathy - and even though we like animals and don't want them to suffer, we change our perception so we don't have to think about whether the animals we are eating, actually suffered.Joy argues that the meat industry have taught us not to feel about the animals being slaughtered by disguising as much as possible what we're actually eating and what happens in the slaughterhouse. Therefore, her point with this book is to deconstruct the invisibility of the system and making us all bear witness to what's really going on. Because even though billions of animals are slaughtered and eaten each year, most of us don't see that many of them - and definitely don't see much of the process of meat production. She deconstruct it by telling it like it is - how are cows, pigs and chickens actually treated in the meat industry. Now, if you've read books like this before, none of this is truly new or shocking but the good thing about this books is that she keeps her head most of the way and at least gives the impression of being straight about the real conditions - how the meat production goes so fast that some animals are not killed at the appropriate moment but sometimes dies bit by bit as they are chopped into pieces, boiled alive, skinned alive etc. - and at the very least, it's probably a safe bet to say that all animals die scared.There were a few new things to me - for instance that it's illegal in some places to boil lobsters alive because they are able to feel it, that it's illegal in Monza, Italy, to keep goldfish confined in small bowls and that in 2005, Human Rights Watch issued a report criticizing the U.S. meat industry for working conditions so appalling that they violate basic human right (p. 80-81)!I really liked how she argued that we are all the collateral damage of carnism because it's not necessarily the most healthy way to eat, it's damaging for the environment - and at least in the US the meat industry doesn't live up to certain health standards (although we in Denmark have several meat scandals recently where super markets sold bad meat). Of course, the workers in the industry also grow accustomed to violence and sometimes act out on their family or others - or on the animals.Now, it is clear that the United States are far behind Europe when it comes to animal rights - in Europe things are still bad but they are not as bad as in the US - as Joy also points out at several points. This doesn't give Europeans a carte blanche to eat meat because if you accept that animals are individuals in their own right who are able to suffer (and several studies have shown them to not only be fully able to feel and suffer but also to have the emotional capacity of at least the same level as young children - something Joy doesn't really go into), then you probably should think about whether it's okay to eat them.As I've already stated, Joy does a good job of not being too emotional, blackmailing us or using bad arguments but she does cross the line - for instance here: \"Under carnism, for instance, democracy has become defines as having the freedom tho choose among products that sicken our bodies and pollute our planet, rather than the freedom to eat our food and breathe our air without the risk of being poisoned.\" (p. 88). Most people making the decisions are also brought up in the system and she makes it sound like decisions makers are determined to keep us unhealthy - and at least some of the research showing the negative effect on the environment and that meat are not the healthiest choice to eat, are very recent and it takes time for all to change. (Although, of course, with the way American politics are being run with lobbyist able to buy politicians, there are some further issues in the States regarding this.)One other thing I've always had a problem with is the comparison between the meat industry and the Nazis' slaughtering of Jews. Although I don't see human beings as in a class of our own compared to the rest of the animals, we do have a bit more mental power and I think there is at the very least a difference in degree between what we are doing to the animals - and what the Nazis did - although I do see the similarities. And maybe it's just because I'm part of this system, this cruelty, because I haven't chosen the right pill yet as Morpheus offered Neo in the Matrix (which Joy also references as a comparison). What this all comes down to is, that as modern human beings we seem to have a choice - at least those of us securely living in the western parts of the world. We do not go hungry if we stop eating meat - and evidence is slowly tickling in suggesting that it is actually healthier for both ourselves and the environment to eat at the very least less meat, if not stop eating it altogether.But why is it then so hard to do? This is because we are trained from a very small age to eat meat. Before we are able to speak for ourselves, we have our first bite of meat. I've read some studies where they suggested that children don't like meat - from my own personal study of one child, I can say that isn't true - although she prefer easily chewable stuff like sausages and ground beef.So I'm not a vegetarian. I'm thinking about becoming it - not just because of this book but because of many books like this, because I don't like much meat and because I don't like the idea of animal suffering. I don't eat a lot of meat but I try to cut down on it all the time and - as Joy also mentions - to do that, you have to face up to the facts regularly to remember why you're doing it.Books like this makes me cry. The descriptions of the brutality of some workers in the slaughterhouses are so incredible cruel that it's almost impossible to understand. I'm not sure if I buy her entire argument yet - but I'm not sure whether that's because I've always been brought up to live in the bubble where it's okay to eat meat or if it's because her arguments are not entirely valid all the way through - I'm still processing it all.Facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored.Aldous Huxley."}, {"userName": "Robin", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/636721-robin", "userReview": "This book portrays itself as a book on the psychology behind which animals we eat and which we don't.

An animal can be classified, for instance, as prey, predator, pest, pet, or food. How we classify an animal, in turn, determines how we relate to it whether we hunt it, flee from it, exterminate it, love it, or eat it. Some overlap can occur between categories (an animal can be prey and food), but when it comes to meat, most animals are either food, or not food. In other words, we have a schema that classifies animals as edible or inedible. [return][return]While I wish Joy would have said  prey, predator, pest, pet, or  protein  to complete the alliteration and perhaps even added  person to include the fellow humans within the scope of analysis, the biggest issue I have with this book is that it never really explores the paradoxes of this paragraph, never really describes the biological, anthropological, and sociological roots of this near universal human cognitive adaptation to categorize animals into such groupings.[return]  How have present and past human cultures categorized various animal species, especially in the course of the development of domestication? [return] How does this categorization relate to the representation of specific animal species in the symbolism of religion, mythology, and folklore? [return] How do other primates and other animals seem to categorize animals based upon field research and behavioral testing? [return] When humans de-humanize each other, what categories of animals are evoked? [return] What does archaeological evidence seem to indicate to be the order of development of these different categories in the history of human culture? [return] What does research indicate about our history as scavengers, as hunter-gatherers, and as agriculture and industrialization emerged? What were past human transitions of diet associated with and how has animal categorization changed over time? [return] What is similar and different between the intuitive categorizations of animals and groupings of edible and inedible plants? [return] How does this categorization relate to essentialism and other aspects of human intuitive biology? [return] How have these adaptations related to human survival and proliferation over the course of human history?  [return]Perhaps good questions, but these are not ones the author explorers in this book.[return][return]Joy does briefly discuss the eating of dogs in the Korean culture and other atypical categorizations, but for the most part, the biological questions raised by the title of this book go unanswered. In Hume s Is-Ought divide, Joy is solely on the  ought side. While the title of the book seems to indicate relevance with scientific work on the  is side and work on this topic in evolutionary psychology is long due, never does Joy explore the anthropologically and culturally deep human journey of the categorization and domestication of other animal species. She only, albeit without much dogmatic and high-minded ethical pronouncement, seems to indicate simplistically, in a philosophically blank slate kind of way, that we, now in the twenty-first century, ought not be domesticating animals for consumption.[return][return]Domesticated bovines are treated horribly in our industrialized society. As are pigs. And poultry. And fish. And more. We ve known this since Upton Sinclair s The Jungle. Yet we seem to continue to hide from ourselves its truths in our supermarketed modern lifestyles. The fact that we, as modern humans, systematically distance ourselves from awareness of the breeding, fattening, and slaughter of these animals seems to indicate an inconsistency in our belief system. Frankly, many, it seems, prefer a good, juicy cheeseburger and avoidance of a bit of distasteful cognitive dissonance over consilience in our understanding of how we (often cruelly) relate to other animal species.[return][return]We've long been omnivorous. Yet we have theory of mind and empathize with the sufferings of others. Now there's a dilemma.[return][return]Despite the title of this book, Joy doesn t explore. One would think there s some interesting anthropological research, some actual work, worth doing.[return][return]Why we love dogs, eat pigs, and wear cows?[return][return]Joy offers no hypothesis.[return][return]She simply presents the case that our beliefs are inconsistent.

It's about psychology, actually social psychology. Melanie Joy actually is a social psychologist, and has used her expertise to focus in non-technical language on a question that is not only baffling to a lot of people, but of great social relevance. This is an ideal use of her gifts. It's obvious to vegetarians that society's attitudes towards animals are inconsistent, but why isn't it obvious to others? She explains this inconsistency in a way that will satisfy vegetarians and make sense to nonvegetarians thinking about this issue as well. In the process, she coins a new word to describe what was previously unnameable: \"carnism,\" the overall belief system that makes meat-eating \"normal.\"I just love how she makes up these simple mnemonic devices and lists to convey her information and make it easy to remember. In order for something really stupid and violent to succeed, where it is something like meat-eating or even as big as the Nazis, it has to be seen as natural, normal, and necessary (the \"three N's\"). There are also three defenses against seeing this reality: objectification, deindividualization, and dichotomization.

It wasn\u2019t a calculated decision. I\u2019d been incorporating more plant-based meals into my diet at that point, in a half-assed attempt at quieting down the voice in my head that told me I couldn\u2019t be an \u201canimal lover\u201d and an animal eater at the same time. But on this particular Saturday afternoon, I had run out of plant-based options, and the only thing I could find in the fridge was malfouf, an Arabic dish made up of cabbage stuffed with ground beef. It happened to also be one of my favorite dishes, and I was hungry, so I decided to have some. While having my lunch, I looked down at a piece I had just bitten into and was stunned by my own reaction. I no longer saw ground beef; I saw ground bits of cow, and I was disgusted. The moral dissonance I\u2019d been grappling with for months had finally caught up with me and I couldn\u2019t look down at my plate again. I was too disgusted to take another bite of that meal, and that was when I decided I would never eat animals again.I recount this story because this book gave me perspective on my own experience. Melanie Joy uses this book to prove that carnism \u2013 the belief system that conditions people to eat some animals and not others \u2013 remains unexamined by us because the industries in power have kept it out of our sight. We don\u2019t witness the horrors of factory farming, because these farms are quite literally removed from our sight. They\u2019re far away, windowless, and no one is allowed to enter them. We are never asked to explain why some animals are our food (cows, chickens) while some are our companions (dogs, hamsters). We have totally dissociated the act of eating meat from the process that sends it to our plates. Most of us can\u2019t even watch videos showing factory farming conditions because of how difficult they are to endure. After all, we all love animals. None of us wants to see them in pain. This is summed up pretty well by the following:\u201cThe paradox is that the very reason we resist bearing witness to the truth of carnism is the same reason we desire to witness: because we care. This is the great truth that lies buried beneath the elaborate, labyrinth mechanisms of the system. Because we care, we want to turn away. And because we care, we feel compelled to bear witness. The way to overcome this paradox is to integrate our witnessing: we must witness the truth of carnism while witnessing ourselves.\u201dThis is how it happened with me. It was all about witnessing. As soon as I had watched a few documentaries and read about the ethics of eating animals, I had some serious questions. All these things that the animal agricultural industries have worked tirelessly to hide from us had finally been brought to my attention and I had a choice: either I could ignore it, dissociate, and continue with my current lifestyle, or I could face it and examine whether I was being true to myself and to my ethics. I knew on that Saturday afternoon, looking down at that fork and seeing the ground bits of cow that hung from the end of it, that I wasn\u2019t being true to myself. This book is short. I read it in three sittings. It doesn\u2019t purport to be the definitive resource on anything, and it doesn\u2019t go in depth on any one topic. It\u2019s written by a social psychologist who has conducted years of research on the psychology of eating animals, and had a few things to say. It\u2019s not a masterpiece, and some of it could have been edited out, but it\u2019s still a solid text that changed my perspective on our attitudes towards animals as food."}, {"userName": "Leanne", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6041498-leanne", "userReview": "The psychology seems sound enough, and it's nice to know that I'm not crazy for not eating meat!

How can these people be explained, and how are we to deal with them?

Joy explores some of the ways we are conditioned to believe this, how it is psychologically and socially ingrained in us, and how the meat and egg and dairy lobbies make sure to keep this indoctrination alive and well.

I found the many quotes and examples throughout the book enlightening and at times darkly humorous, such as reprinted selections from comments on the ASPCA blog. The ASPCA had written about the use of dogs as food in Korea, which provoked a flurry of comments about the \"satanic\" nature of such an industry. The ASPCA also happens to be one of the last major humane groups to still serve meat at its functions, and, as the author implied previously in her chapter on customary American farming practices, the dogs' treatment is almost identical to factory farmed pigs, chickens, and cattle.As noted earlier, this is a short book, and the author begins to falter toward the end, when she tries to cram in too many facts and statistics on the benefits of becoming a vegetarian. Although I understand the motivation, it makes for choppy and repetitive reading for those of us who are already herbivores. Although the writer aims the book toward omnivores in hopes of encouraging them to rethink their dietary practices, sadly, this may be wishful thinking.

As Gary Francione points out, given that there is no nutritional need for us to consume animal products, our best reasons for using animals are pleasure, convenience or habit. As such, anyone who thinks it wrong to harm animals for no better reason than that doing so is convenient, gives you pleasure, or is \u2018traditional,\u2019 and who wishes to live up to their own values, must stop participating in animal exploitation and go vegan. That said, for a variety of reasons (some of which I\u2019ll discuss later), many vegans find it difficult to clearly explain or convey their reasons for not using animals, so that when asked, most come up with little more than that they \u2018reject suffering\u2019, without being able to explain why their refusal to eat animal products is inspired by something more than \u2018increased\u2019 sensitivity to suffering/injustice, or an (arbitrary) \u2018lifestyle choice\u2019.One reason for this is of course the relative novelty of veganism, and the fact that, societally speaking, talking about -- never even mind advocating for -- veganism, is mostly untrodden ground. You might say that we\u2019re still figuring out how to integrate veganism, how best to explain our decision/realization, and how to advocate for an end to the use of other animals. One reason for this (related to reading), is that most authors who write about animal use prefer appealing to \u2018sympathy\u2019 and 'compassion,\u2019 while inundating readers with information concerning the many ways in which specific animals are being mistreated \u2013 thereby, sadly, inviting the thoughts that use as such is morally unproblematic, and that certain forms of use (hunting, use of birds for the production of liver, veal eating, bullfighting, capturing/killing of cetaceans/great apes versus other animals) are \u2018more unjust\u2019 than others; thereby reinforcing the notion that we humans get to decide what animals' lives look like. Luckily, however, theoretical foundation for the spread of veganism as a new moral baseline has already been laid.Shortly after I and my partner went vegan, we attended a presentation by Joy, based on this book. As people who were already thinking about veganism, we found Joy\u2019s talk, in which she encourages her audience to \u2018make the connection\u2019 between the animals we love and those we eat quite compelling and convincing, and we felt strengthened in our conviction that we should stop using animals. That said, we also came away feeling somewhat dejected, as the discussion that followed had left us with a vague, but strong impression that trying to convince others to go vegan is at the very least daunting, if not outright impossible. This struck us as odd, since we were both been quite happy to go vegan once we \u2013 finally \u2013 found out that a plant-based diet is nutritionally adequate (and healthy). But we didn\u2019t really dwell on this, trusting the experience of our 'fellow travelers'. And when we ran across Gary Francione's work shortly afterwards, we mostly forgot about Joy\u2019s presentation, as we found his work much more helpful in understanding and explaining our decision to go vegan, and advocating for veganism. :)Some time ago, however, the urge struck me to read this book, to see if I could figure out why we felt the way we did at the time. In doing so, I paid particular attention to the questions whether the book contained what I\u2019d consider to be an adequate definition of, and argument(s) for veganism; what information is presented, how that information is tied together; and how useful the book is for people interested in advocacy. Given that Joy\u2019s reason for writing the book is to convince readers to stop using animals (though I should point out that Joy \u2013 sadly \u2013 here explicitly presents going vegan as no more than an \u2018ideal\u2019 to be aspired to; see p. 147), and to help readers understand why not everyone will respond to that message with (equal) enthusiasm, this seems to me fair.As the title indicates, Joy aims to provide an answer to the question why we 'love dogs, eat pigs, and wear cows' (given that all animals are equally sentient, and that all animals enjoy life, and wish to continue it for as long as possible, without being harmed). The short version of her answer is habit/culture: we use and treat animals in the ways that we do, and for the purposes that we do, because we\u2019ve been doing so since the dawn of time. The real question, of course, is why we never think about it for very long. Her explanation for this is that our thoughts are controlled by a \"system [that] dictates which animals are edible, and [which] enables us to consume them by protecting us from feeling any emotional or psychological discomfort when doing so. The system teaches us how to not feel.\" (pp. 17-18.) As such, she argues, our beliefs concerning the justness of animal use are not considered beliefs, but rather ones that are forced on people by (internalized) \u2018carnism\u2019 (p. 131-34), via messages that appear to justify our disinterest in the question whether the use of animals for food (etc.) is justifiable (pp. 96-100). And because Joy thinks a. that this is a \u2018system\u2019 (i.e., a coherent whole), and b. that this system is \u201cinvisible,\u201d her main aim is to make readers aware of the contours and limits of that system, so that it can be labeled, recognized, and discussed.To make this a bit more concrete, let me mention a few of the mechanisms and behaviors that Joy argues allow (and \u2018force\u2019) us to remain oblivious to the consequences of our continued nonveganism, both for the animals, and for the humans who make a living by meeting our demand for animal products. To start with the societal level: here, disinterest is expressed through, and enabled by, the physical distance between farms and slaughterhouses and the rest of society; their closed nature; the fact that these are low status jobs, often held by immigrants and members of marginalized social groups. At the psychological level, some of the mechanisms involved are deindividualization [i.e., our numbering of animals, disinterest in accurately referencing their gender when speaking about animals], objectification [using euphemisms, and speaking about animals in terms of the consumer products we turn them into, such as \"beef\" and \"pork,\" speaking about \"meat\" as opposed to \"flesh\", etc.], and dichotomization [categorizing animals as 'pets' versus 'livestock', and treating animal interests very differently depending on the purpose we assign to them]. And a last element she emphasizes is how, when one attempts to point out to nonvegans that they are paying for the products of violence, people generally respond by referring to the normality, naturalness and/or necessity of the eating of animals; often helped by the fact government, industry, lobbies and marketing firms, who all broadcast messages that support the idea that animal product consumption is morally unproblematic. All of these things, Joy argues, are aspects of what she calls 'carnism'.But although this seems to leave little to no room for escaping said 'system,' Joy does think it possible for people to \"[step] outside the [system]\" -- namely, by \u201creclaim[ing the] empathy that the system has worked so hard to protect you from,\u201d (p. 134), by \u201cbearing witness\" (Ch. 7) to the suffering that our consumer behavior necessarily brings about, by allowing ourselves to acknowledge that the animals we use are persons rather than things, and by taking responsibility for our actions (\u201cexerciz[ing] our free will\u201d).Although most of the above points strike me as valid observations as far as they go, I have a number of interrelated objections to Joy\u2019s choice of framework, her explanations as to why people seem unwilling to reconsider their nonveganism, and her advice when it comes to advocacy. Firstly, I am quite disappointed that Joy repeatedly encourages the thought that it makes moral sense to become vegetarian (or to simply eat animal products less often), given that unnecessarily using and killing (fewer) animals for the production of dairy, eggs, wool, fur, down and leather is just as unjustifiable as using and killing them more often, and/or for the production of meat \u2013 not least because dairy cows, laying hens and sheep are all slaughtered once their \u201cproductivity\u201d dips below a certain threshold, and/or before they become \u201ctoo old\u201d to be sold as meat. Given that we can live on plants alone, all use is avoidable, and thus frivolous. Nonvegans need help making sense of their intuitions surrounding inflicting (unnecessary) harm, not additional encouragement to remain nonvegan, or endorsements of \"qualified\" nonveganism.Secondly, I find her suggestion that our thoughts and behavior are \u201ccontrolled by [a] system\u201d problematic. First, because calling it an ideology (p.30) serves, implicitly, to push the notion that we\u2019re talking about a coherent, self-sealed whole, acceptance of which is (by association) \u2018foundational\u2019 and/or \u2018beyond reason,\u2019 as ideologies are generally thought to be, when even the title of her book points out that it's not. Because if there's one thing that's clear, it's that as human beings, we are hugely confused and conflicted when it comes to the question what to think of the fact that we breed, use, and kill animals -- on the one hand, most people agree that unnecessary harm is wrong; on the other, most humans are willing (because they were untaught to think about this as a moral issue) to pay others to produce animals and animal products (when this isn't necessary).Second, because the suggestion that a \"system\" can 'make us think' that animal use is justifiable rests on a world view with little to no room for personal responsibility, which leaves little conceptual space for engaging in advocacy. By doing so, she denies/ignores the fact that our choices to engage in the use and consumption of animals and animal products (as well as a choice to respond defensively to challenges of those choices), are fundamentally free, even as they are informed by habit, combined with a -- sometimes unspoken, sometimes explicitly acknowledged -- desire to remain oblivious, often informed in turn by what you might call species privilege: a deeply felt conviction that we don't have to justify ourselves when it comes to using other animals. And while I certainly won't deny the fact that people aren\u2019t actively aware of the myriad ways in which their obliviousness is maintained, pointing out that this is the case doesn't help, because it's just one of many symptoms. And especially when you engage in advocacy (including by writing this book), it is generally very counterproductive to tell people that their behavior \u2018can be explained psychologically\u2019, because of how it signals that you are pathologizing them, and not acknowledging their shared, full humanity. What I would propose instead is to ask the people you talk with (or write for) to consider whether they care about animals; and if they indicate that they do, to ask them to reconsider their nonveganism, and discussing with them why whatever reasons they have for continuing don't hold water, because of how the forms of use they do engage in are just as wrong as any forms they find objectionable, and that the animals whose use/killing they do object to, are morally no different from the animals who they do use and kill (either directly or via 'the market'). (While Joy's approach may seem compatible with this, the problem is that it pulls you in a very different direction.) This is the approach taken by Francione and Charlton in Eat Like You Care: An Examination of the Morality of Eating Animals, a book they wrote to show advocates how one might structure such a conversation, by discussing, in long form, how to get people to see that anyone who objects to Michael Vick's choice to participate in and organize dog fights should go vegan, given that dog fighting is just as unjustifiable, and just as unnecessary, as is the use of animals for food (or clothing, or entertainment).In other words, after first attempting to kindle the reader's moral concern, by discussing the case of Michael Vick, and helping the reader get clear whether they truly object to Vick's behavior because of the consequences for the animals involved, they then explore the inconsistency between the reader's values and actions (given their participation in animal use). Joy\u2019s approach, on the other hand, only makes the inconsistency explicit, without pointing to the moral considerations that underlie the inconsistency, out of her (misguided) conviction that it is useless (and/or impossible) to engage with inconsistencies in people\u2019s beliefs and behavior directly. As a consequence (and as an aside, you see this happening in quite a few negative reviews of this book), although reading it may make (non-vegan) readers temporarily aware of the arbitrariness of their beliefs, and although it may make them understand that their defensiveness is \u2018irrational\u2019, because they aren't asked to make sense of the inconsistency in the light of the equal needs, interests and wants shared by all animals, and because they are strongly encouraged to understand themselves as hapless victims of larger social forces, there is next to no chance that they'll recognize their non-veganism is morally indefensible in light of values they already hold. All Joy's approach has to offer is a request to \u2018start caring,\u2019 and/or to \u2018bear witness\u2019 [through some combination of watching animals to recognize their playfulness, exposing yourself to gruesome imagery of animals being exploited and killed (while telling yourself that you don\u2019t want to have this on your conscience), etc.]. This seems to me a huge missed opportunity.To recap, I have two (interconnected) reasons for considering Joy\u2019s approach problematic. Firstly, I think the overall direction of the arguments presented in this book extremely \u2013 and unnecessarily \u2013 disempowering, because of how she encourages the notion that people have no real control over \u2013 and aren\u2019t responsible for \u2013 the values and beliefs that they hold. Secondly, I dislike how Joy tells readers (and potential advocates looking for insight) that the problem is that those who aren\u2019t yet vegans don\u2019t \u2018care\u2019 enough (yet). Certainly they\u2019re not acting in harmony with their values, and certainly, it is important (and effortful) to cultivate people's moral concern, if you wish to help them find the desire to act on their new insights. But that's very different from people not caring.As such, if you are interested in becoming better advocates, I would really recommend familiarizing yourself with the approach taken by Francione & Charlton, who offer readers a kind of swiss army knife, by showing how veganism follows from nothing more than the belief that it's wrong to unnecessarily harm animals, and how that's really all someone needs to agree to.

As the title states, this book provides introductory information on carnism and the meat industry in the United States.

A step-by-step analysis of a cultural blind spot, it is a powerful blend of reason, compassion, and psychological insight. The primary focus is on the practice of eating meat, our inherited attitudes, and the callous manipulation of our minds by those who stand to profit. While duly informing the reader about the atrocities committed by industrialized meat industry, the author is really aiming to get the reader to question his or her own silent beliefs. And one dreaded comparison is inevitable. Whenever human beings are rounded up and slaughtered by sophisticated, industrialized killing machines, we called it an atrocity. Yet today animals are bred, drugged, crammed into concentration camps, and horribly slaughtered \u2013 by the billions every year. Most of us eat the result. The book is well constructed, assembling questions, evidence, and logic to bring us face to face with our moral conflicts \u2013 and our moral numbing. Whatever your position on meat may be, this book will amaze and enlighten you about your own attitudes. It would make a powerful addition to the reading list for courses on critical thinking and psychological defense mechanisms. What I found most impressive was the author\u2019s capacity to empathize with readers who have never thought about these things, and to pique not guilt, but curiosity.Please have the courage to challenge mental habits and be curious. This book is a frank and friendly guide that can be your ally in understanding yourself, your culture \u2013 and your choices."}, {"userName": "Kate Lawrence", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1277721-kate-lawrence", "userReview": "Ideally qualified to investigate the mindset that permits humans to mistreat and eat so-called \"food\" animals while lavishing love and expensive veterinary care on dogs and cats, the author is a social psychologist and professor of psychology. She describes the suffering not only of the factory farmed animals, but of slaughterhouse workers, people living near factory farms who become ill because of the factories' waste products, omnivores who consume a variety of pesticides, hormones, deadly viruses and feces in their meat, and us taxpayers who are subsidizing it all. Meat inspection, which most omnivorous people think is protecting them, is either a joke or nonexistent. It really makes you wonder why a system so hazardous to our health and the environment has continued and in fact, worsened, for so long without a major public outcry. Which is just what the author sets out to explore, in ways that were new to me.For example, \"the three Ns of justification\"--Normal, Natural and Necessary. All violent ideologies, such as the Nazi Holocaust, have had to convince the populace of the three Ns. A society must get its legal system and news media to support a system of violence, which ours definitely does in its complete acceptance of meat-eating. Then there are the three defenses the author calls the Cognitive Trio: objectification, deindividualization, and dichotomization. A fascinating discussion. The book ends with a section of resources for transitioning to a meat-free diet. Anyone concerned about the hazardous and cruel American way of producing meat will find helpful information here along with encouragement to be part of the solution."}, {"userName": "Ryan", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6985392-ryan", "userReview": "Admitting my bias off the bat: I'm vegan for over a year now so I already subscribe to many of the ideas presented in this book.That aside, I believe this book is highly effective in communicating the ideas around veganism and carnism. The author does an adequate job in discussing societal norms and how meat eating has become the default way of life through various means. At one point she compares this way of life to the Matrix; how it is a false reality that hides the truth. Again, I agree with this approach but it is a big pill (no movie pun intended) for many to swallow. You must be willing to shed the claims (propaganda) put forth in company ads, FDA recommendations, school lunch programs, etc.I must criticize the author some for her numerous references to the Holocaust. While reasonable in a few situations the comparisons were over done. Any time you make such extreme comparisons people, regardless of how accurate you may be, automatically discredit what you are saying. Right or wrong, that's the way it is. Grand atrocities do exist in our current food production system. Those atrocities, however, can be discussed on their own merit and comparisons to genocide need not be made.Overall, I recommend this read to anyone (meat eaters, vegetarians and vegans alike) concerned about health, diet, nutrition, disease, sustainability or similar topics. It's a quick read (only 150 pages) and provides tremendous insights and opportunities for discussion."}, {"userName": "Hudsonpubliclibrary", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20790305-hudsonpubliclibrary", "userReview": "A warning: this is not really a look into the cultural norms that might explain the question pose by the title. It is NOT really a look into why we love puppies and not pigs/cows so much as it is a distinctly brutal look into the violent practices of meat production around the world and the ways in which we have internalized this process as \"normal\" and \"necessary\". The writing was so good that, despite the harsh and disturbing content, this book really kept my interest. It was actually a really thoughtfully prepared work on the subject I had not before even considered witnessing and has made my mind turn quite a lot on all of these new thoughts. Also I enjoyed that though some of the descriptions of what goes on in the meat/dairy/seafood production are necessarily descriptive and cringe-inducing; there was not the sort of disturbing shock-imagery overload that would have made me put the book down in dismay. In all I'd have to say that this has started me really wondering about the meat industries and my part in submitting to a culture of carnism. Highly recommend it to anyone who wonders about just how we have come to convince ourselves that meat consumption is natural, necessary and yet so far from our minds."}, {"userName": "Karly", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7149482-karly", "userReview": "Wow. So much information but written in a totally manageable way. This is one of the best non-fiction books I have ever read. It starts by describing what \"carnism\" is and how we are all affected by the meat industry. It's all quotes or facts that are sourced or studies that are sourced. There are literally 36 pages of sources sited at the end of this book. So no need to feel this is information she is making up! The last section of the book is dedicated to how to make a change in our meat-heavy world. She offers three simple steps to make an impact: 1) Reduce or eliminate your meat intake (even if you still eat meat once or twice a month that makes a huge impact!) 2) Support an animal welfare or advocacy group (even if it's just an Fbook group!) and 3) Inform yourself. Don't stop learning about the meat industry or agribusinesses (there is always more to know!) As I said before this book is FULL of information but at no point does it get dry or hard to follow.

She coins the term \"carnism\" to describe the belief system that has conditioned us to eat certain animals and not others.In Why We Love Dogs, Eat Pigs, and Wear Cows, Joy investigates factory farming, exposing how cruelly animals are treated, the hazards meat-packing workers face, and the environmental impact of raising 10 billion animals for food each year.
