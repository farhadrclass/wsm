I had to hold off reading it when I initially received the newsletter, because, obviously, I wasn't quite caught up with the series yet. This one was an extremely short read, but still a nice little Christmas-y kind of read! It's a scene, a mere moment between Charley and Reyes after the events of the The Curse of the Tenth Grave--so be wary of a HUGE spoiler within it!It's truly just a short little memory of a Christmas Reyes had. And as we all know, Reyes had very few happy memories in his childhood. While this one was part good, it naturally wasn't all happy.Thankfully, Charley is there to make the current moment in time a happy one! This is definitely just a short little read for the fans of all things Charley and Reyes. Overall Rating 4/5 stars"}, {"userName": "The Book Junkie Reads . . .", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7377888-the-book-junkie-reads", "userReview": "A holiday insight into Reyes following the loss of Kim, the birth of his daughter and all the other things that have been going on around him and Charley.
