She always knows how to make me smile and I always loose track of time reading her books. So when I found out she had a new book coming out. I immediately preordered it and it feels like I've been waiting for it for AGES!!So in this book we meet Flora who is born and breed in Muir. A beautiful, rustic, Scottish Isle. However she has moved to London to live out her dream to be a lawyer. Although at the moment she is a paralegal as she hasn't taken her final exams to become a lawyer yet. She works for a company who doesn't really know she exists and is head over heals in love with her boss. Who again doesn't know of her existence. But Flora knows she will one day be able to charm this bad boy and he will fall head over heals in love with her too. One day a American man comes into their office wanting their help to oppose a wind farm that is going to be set up across the water from Muir where he has gone to restor a old monument and turn it into a posh hotel. He has been trying to oppose the windfarm but is having no luck. Knowing they have Flora in their office who comes from Muir. He demands she helps him get the people of Muir to stand behind him and oppose the wind farm too. The only problem is. The people in Muir dislike Flora, and Flora hadn't been home since her mother passed away. Finding herself back in Muir is the last thing she wants. But to keep her job. She will have to swallow her pride and return home. Their she finds out that they hate the new American guy in the town as he hasn't even tried to integrate himself and he doesn't buy from local suppliers but instead gets everything shipped in from miles away so why should they help him. When he doesn't want to help them. To have any chance in turning the people around Flora must turn things around, own up to her past, reconnect with her family and the people of the town and find out who she is. Will Flora also find love along the way? I have to say this is a good book. I wasn't overly keen on who Flora gets with in the end. I mean I saw it coming but I would have preferred it to be someone else. You'll understand what I mean when you read the book. I just thought he wasn't the right match for her and I never really warmed to him. He seemed to change his spots right at the end of the book and something just felt a bit off about their relationship. That said I knew they would get together. Jenny has left herself open to another book in Muir which is wonderful as id love to go back and visit the town and people again soon. I would love to catch up with Flora, her family and her best friend and see how the town are doing now. When A book mixes together two of my loves. Cooking and reading. It is always a winner for me. So I'll forgive the person and the bit of the plot that I found predictable and still give it four stars. I hope you all enjoy your trip to Muir.

The fact that Joel was as broken as he was, (albeit for very valid reasons), and yet somehow managed to do an entire about-face, break down all his carefully constructed walls and fall in love with Flora, someone he'd never noticed before who was absolutely not his type, and, it was implied, give up the lifestyle he'd been leading forever, all because she was just so damn wonderful and \"exactly what he didn't know he needed\" made me want to hurl. I get it, this is a major romance novel trope, but it is infuriating, maybe more so because I know people in real life who continue to ruin their lives by making poor choices based on this stupid fantasy. I'm probably more touchy than most about the subject, having been a counselor for years, but there you have it. Shame on you, Jenny Colgan, for encouraging such unhealthy attitudes!

Then when her mother died she railed against her well meaning neighbors and well and truly burnt all her bridges. Three years later she is working as a paralegal for a prestigious law firm in London.But life in the city is anything but perfect. Her job is a grind, her coworkers are hard and don't get her and she is secretly in love with a senior partner who treats women like disposable commodities. Then Joel, the senior partner, takes on a new client who is building a resort on Mure Island and wants to stop a wind farm spoiling his views. Flora is sent home to try and bring the locals on board but in returning she is crashing into her past. Her grief for her mother. Her father who is barely holding onto the farm and her brothers who are bitter that she left. After discovering her mother's journal, a hand written recipe book, she starts cooking and in doing so begins to heal the wounds of the past. The Summer Seaside Kitchen is one of those rare books that heals the heart. It's a gentle love story about broken people who somehow manage to patch things up and move forward.

After Bookshop I thought I had a new author. Now I'm thinking Bookshop was an outlier. Bookshop was quite bookish, as you might expect, which was a big draw for that book. But even more, that story was about a young woman who had a driving life passion (not a life-driving passion for a man, which was pretty much the yawny case with for Cafe), and when confronted by a sudden requirement to figure out what to do with her life, made a number of risky-courageous decisions to go on the direction of what she wanted to do with her life, who she wanted to be, what difference she wanted to make in the world. Over the course of the book (Bookshop, not Cafe), she grew into her natural independence and adopted confidence and boldness to achieve the crazy thing she wanted. And yes, there was a romance element to the Bookshop story, but it wasn't the driver, and it evolved in the direction of the protagonist becoming an increasingly strong character. The romance itself was suspense-filled and interesting, with the protagonist being more a driver and less a passive vessel for external forces of romantic fortune and misfortune. It was also without most of the typical cheesiness--it felt like part of her story and not the reason for her to have a story. It was a really satisfying light read. Again, that's Bookshop, not Cafe. This book, Cafe, also has a wilds-of-Scotland backdrop, and features another 20-something who is finding her way, and is a romance. But beyond Scotland, it lacks all the appeal of Bookshop. This flailing young woman is not redeemed by a strong personal vision and brave movements in that direction. Instead she is at the mercy of her life--her personal loss, her job, the needs of her family, the needs of the client, the needs of the community, the needs of man who makes her heart go pitty-pat, the amenability of this man or that to whatever tentative desire or direction she might edge toward. She sort of falls into a direction, all of it about helping everyone out and being everyone's support structure, and falls into a romance. None of it felt true, hard won, a result of an interesting character living courageously on an edge, as Bookshop did. It felt passive, a traditional female following social pressures toward domestic choices that would allow her to help everyone around her to be ok, to get what they needed. There was nothing special about this character, her supporting characters, or the story. Because this wasn't a full-on smarmy romance, and was better written than maybe average in the genre (not my genre obviously), I rounded to a 3. As a reading experience, it started at maybe a 2.75 and went steadily downhill. I don't expect to try any more by this author, though Bookshop remains a happy reading memory."}, {"userName": "Odette Knappers", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35775020-odette-knappers", "userReview": "Wat was dit een heerlijke chicklit!Ik dacht dat ik was uitgekeken op dit genre. Vandaar dat dit leesexemplaar een beetje bleef liggen, en toen verscheen het boek en oeps haha. Nouja ik had zin in iets lichts en luchtigs, dus ik gaf het een kans. Wat bleek: ik ben niet uitgekeken op het genre, ik ben uitgekeken op schrijfsters als Mansell en Kinsella. Nou zijn zij erg toonaangevend en is het dus logisch dat hun voorbeeld veel wordt gevolgd, maar er is natuurlijk veel meer dan hun boeken en boeken die er op lijken.Jenny Colgan was de frisse wind die voor mij even nodig was in het chicklitgenre. Grappig, leuke humor, maar toch ook een serieus onderwerp. Dit boek draait niet om die ene afgrijselijke en/of onbereikbare man! Het gaat over Flora en haar thuisgevoel (of gebrek daaraan) bij haar familie op hun eiland. Dat vind ik een verfrissende focus voor een chicklit, en maakt dat het verhaal meer body heeft. Natuurlijk komt het mannelijk geslacht met alle voor- en nadelen wel aan bod, maar het is niet het hoofdonderwerp van het boek. Dat vond ik leuk.Al met al erg genoten van dit boek dus, en ik hoop zeker dat er meer van haar vertaald gaat worden! Haar boek over een boekwinkel heb ik al in de kast staan voor mijn boekhandelboekenverzameling, erg blij dat haar stijl bij me in de smaak viel :)"}, {"userName": "Brittain *The Baddest Female*", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18715203-brittain-the-baddest-female", "userReview": "Apparently, I am easy to please when it comes to books. There seems to be a checklist that I was previously unaware of that will almost guarantee that, if followed, I will enjoy the book.1) If there is a dog, especially one with a big personality.Pets in general shape our lives to an enormous extent. I cannot leave my house without giving scritchies to two dogs that aren't even mine. My own dog is spoiled to such an extent by my father that she literally has a football season wardrobe. This big burly farm grown man who had almost exclusively had collies and labs in his life has been taken over by my 16 pound terrier who owns the house. Dogs can make scenes in books so light and fun while also providing comfort and something warm for a brokenhearted person to cling to.This book had a wonderful dog.His name is Bramble and he is a bit of a Velcro dog which causes some problems but also provides these enormous and needed moments of levity. Bramble gives the heroine in this book, a lonely paralegal named Flora, another being to center herself with. This dog helps chip away at her loneliness which is so important for this book.2) A beautiful location that is taken advantage of.In the same way that pets shape our lives, the environment shapes our lives as well. What is the point of having a fantastic setting if you don't use it for anything? I can't tell you how many books that I have read that are set in distinctive places but there is no flavor of that place in the book.This book is definitely defined by its setting, a wild island off the coast of Scotland named Mure.I recently was asked the question of why Americans were so obsessed with Scotland, Ireland, or wherever their family originally hailed from. We seek out our pasts in big ways. I think this is because it is so difficult to identify a true \"American Culture\" except for those that existed before European settlement, which most Americans do not celebrate. So we seek out our own histories. We want roots. This book has deep roots, in both its history and its setting. There were local legends. There were old farms and traditions. The people that were there were not just side characters but had stories of their own. This is what makes a book come to life. It isn't the story itself most of the time, it is the depth to which you explore your surroundings and the lives of other characters.3) Food.I'm a sucker for a book with some good homestyle cooking in it. There's soul in cooking and it can give a piece of normalcy to a book. You don't hear about characters showering or vacuuming the floors or any other type of household task but the act of cooking and bringing people together over food can make a book seem so comforting.It makes it feel cozy. It makes me hungry too which is why it is good that there are recipes included at the end of the book.4) A character to cheer for.As a reader, you have to ask yourself what a character wants and how are they going to get it. In this book, Flora is lost. She lives a rather unfulfilling life crushing on her boss, not making any progress in her career, and avoiding her family and sorrow. She is stagnated. It makes you pity her because you just want her to put one foot in front of the other but she seems to have lead soles. Without a character to cheer for, there is no purpose to a book. You have to start at a point from which a character can grow but they also have to make mistakes along the way. It can't all be smooth sailing and they have to mess up occasionally in realistic ways. Flaws are things like clumsiness or forgetfulness which are often substitutes for real flaws in lead characters. Flaws have to be deep and they have to reach a character's soul. They must be something to be accepted or overcome instead of avoided. Flora takes steps to acknowledge her past mistakes and her family which means that she is making progress. It shows that fences can be mended and there is a place that you belong somewhere which is so important.5) So we have a character that wins but also a character that fails.Like I said, not everything is smooth sailing. Nobody ever finds their cajones or their purpose in life at the same time as everybody else. I think that in order to have a good book, you also have to have characters that accept failure or disappointment in some way. That shows real life. There is no guarantee that you are going to ace all of your tests or succeed the first time you try something but the important thing is that you try.Characters in this book royally screw up. They do it multiple times in heart rending ways. You want to shake them and scream at them to get their acts together but nothing but their own determination will make them successful or put them at peace.So a pretty simple list, right?In the end, I just want a book with depth and this one really delivered. It had history and soul and all of the things that you want in a good story. It made me laugh and cry. It broke my heart a few times. But it showed a tiny slice of life somewhere else in the world. There is nothing in this book that was altogether unbelievable. There were no fairies or perfect people wandering around. Everybody was just so perfectly flawed and it made it feel so comforting.This book felt like a hug. It made me long to travel and explore but really just go home to my family where I know they are always there with welcoming arms and a sarcastic remark. When a book can make you want to go home, you know it did a good job."}, {"userName": "Kathryn", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3076351-kathryn", "userReview": "4.5 stars.

She spends her days hoping her boss will notice her and fall in love with her and her nights lonely and alone. When her boss suddenly asks her to do a big job for an important client, Flora is elated, until she realizes this job will take her back to Mure, a place she fled three years ago after her mother's death. Back on Mure, Flora is an outcast. Her father is silent, her brothers crude, rude and mean as always. They work hard on the farm to be sure, but would it kill them to cook and clean a little? A mishap in the kitchen forces Flora to rediscover her mother's recipes and confront her conflicted past. She also meets a handsome nature guide, Charlie, from another island and he seems to fancy her. Will she at last break her dry spell of dating? Then her boss shows up to deal with the American billionaire client and they need Flora's help. Can she come to terms with her past and get the locals to forgive her for leaving? Joel, Flora's boss, is a hot shot lawyer who has lived all over the world. He can't stand the godforsaken wilderness that is Mure. He never notices his paralegal in London but on Mure she is like a different creature. It's almost like the island weaves a spell around everyone and everything. He must be careful not to notice too much or he'll lose his armor he has carefully built up. This book is so full of feels! Jenny Colgan has a way of building a story up to a heartwarming and tearjerking climax. She still needs to work on her endings. This one is a bit abrupt and the story could use a sequel. The character development here is top notch. None of the characters are appealing at first but as the point-of-view shifts, the reader becomes more involved in that character's life story and starts to feel a fondness for them. I did not like the love triangle and was surprised by how it played out. Even so, I liked this heaps more than her mobile bookshop story. The local color here is amazing! Mure is a place where the sun never sets in summer, the old tongue is sometimes spoken, myths and legends are fully believed and cream and butter come from actual cows on a local farm. The sea, the sky, the beach, the farms- Mure sounds like another world. I could easily picture it. At first I didn't like Flora. I didn't like how mousy she was and how lame her London life was. This story sounded similar to Sophie Kinsella's My Not So Perfect Life with Flora being a whiny, bored wannabe Londoner with the heart of a farm girl, but I think the character development here is better and more realistic. Flora has to confront past demons and come to terms with her grief over her mother's death. She also has to interact with several big, noisy brothers and a taciturn father, all of whom are grieving in their own way. I teared up a bit when Flora found her mother's recipe book. I loved the concept of finding it and how much it meant to Flora's Mum and how the recipes are being passed down. The food didn't really appeal to me all that much but having my own similar recipe book from my grandmother, I was very interested in Flora's cooking experiments and how that helped her on her journey. I came to know Flora as a sweet, caring, feeling young woman trying to find her place in the world independent of her family.Joel comes across as a nasty, cold smart hot shot lawyer and womanizer. He dates young, stick thin blonds who never eat. He spends one night with them- no more - leaving a trail of broken hearts or whining women anyway, in his wake. His backstory doesn't come out until late in the book and it explains some of the reason why he is the way he is. I felt his character development was a bit unrealistic. His relationship with Mure is too predictable but abrupt. Charlie is complicated. I agree with Flora's final assessment of him. I really really liked how he helps inner city kids enjoy nature and how he provides them with a strong male role model. I loved how he was from another island and was still a foreigner! I loved how he prefers his Gaelic name. Flora's family is messy and complicated like real families. Her brothers have their own individual identities. Iness is a bit of a hard hearted jerk at times. His daughter Agot is a very immature, bratty 3 year old. My nieces never acted like that at 3 and they know Peppa is a GIRL pig LOL! We don't really know what happened with Iness and his ex-wife but she isn't a very good mother. I liked Hamish, the slow witted one. He's a gentle giant, I think. The one thing he wanted was a surprise and so funny. Fintan was a bit of a surprise. At first I thought he was a jerk to his family but there is a reason behind his moods. Finally, there's Colton Rogers. I expected someone totally different. He provides the comic relief. I couldn't help but like him.Fans of Jenny Colgan's other books will not be disappointed in this one. Fans of Kristan Higgins and Sophie Kinsella will like this one too.Content: Some language, dialogue, innuendo and off page love scenes."}, {"userName": "Aura", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9936091-aura", "userReview": "Flora left her Northern Scottish town of Mure after her mother died.

The Cafe By the Sea didn't do it for me. It lacked charm and likable characters. I just couldn't warm to Flora and Joel was a very one-dimensional \"hero\". The setting was lovely, but the attempt to bring the magical element into the story failed. It seemed forced. I also found myself scoffing at the premise which seemed a bit unrealistic. The stuff with the Outward Bound couple was clumsy and wasn't really necessary to the story other than a plot device. All in all it was badly constructed which was very sad for me because I was really looking forward to it being grand."}, {"userName": "Obsidian", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35942740-obsidian", "userReview": "Sorry, the main reason I cannot give this above three stars is that I can never cheer for a woman (fictional or not) being the reason that a man who is an asshole changes his ways. It never feels realistic and it just ends up making me annoyed the author writes a guy that you end up not liking and wish would just disappear from the book. I liked the character of Flora and her family (her three brothers and father are great) but thought she was self absorbed and sharp to people too much. I did love the book getting into the recipes her mother passed down and the author including some of them in the back of the book was much appreciated. That said, I found that there was a bit too much going on in this first book. We have a couple of plot-lines and though the selkie myth was intriguing, I wish that Colgan had leaned a bit more into that and had an air of magical realism in this book. After having a fight with her family, Flora resolves to never return home to the island of Mure (off the coast of Scotland). Flora is determined to have a life in London and though she has crushes here and there, is mostly fixated on her boss, Joel. When a client demands that Joel's firm handle a potential issue on Mure that will impact his hotel and livelihood, Flora is sent to Mure to deal with things. Being back home among her family and friends, Flora finally comes to grips with her past and present. Flora was an okay character, but I think another character her supposed childhood best friend Lorna who I think at one point pretty much tells Flora she needs to get over things. Lorna apparently has gone through similar things as Flora, but you don't see her being a jerk about it. Flora has two love interests in this book (I was only rooting for one) and is doing her best to have her firm look its best with her on hand on Mure to help. We have secondary characters in this, but the book mostly revolves around Flora. I did love Flora's brother Fintan a secret that he has been harboring for a long time. His resentment of Flora for getting away from Mure was a bit much to take after a while though. I was glad when that all got resolved. I did wish we got more conversations/dialogue with Lorna.The writing was okay, but after a while the whole book started to feel a bit same-y to me. We have Flora realizing her family's farm isn't doing so well, we have her not really working, and then she cleans and cooks. Lather, rinse, repeat. It's not until Joel shows up in Mure does the story start moving forward a bit. The island of Mure sounds magical. I liked reading about selkies and we finally get Flora re-counting a story her mother told her about the mythical creatures at the end of the book. As I said above, I wish that Colgan had leaned in a bit more into the magical realism genre. The ending was not the least bit realistic.

If you enjoy light-hearted stories with easy to like characters, give her books a read. The Cafe by the Sea is a good book to read as your first book by this author. It has family issues, acceptance problems, love and a wonderful story of learning to be who you are meant to be and not who others want you to be. Along with that there are beautiful descriptions of the islands in Scotland and to top it all off - RECIPES for the food that is written about in the book - Bannocks and Steak and Ale Pie are two that I would try if I cooked. Flora fled to London after her mother died, leaving bitter words to her family and her community in the small island of Mure in northern Scotland. When she is sent back on an assignment for her law firm to try to help a rich US tech mogul fight a local plan to build wind turbines that would ruin his view, she has to face the negative feelings from hr family and the small town. Along with missing London and her life there, she had a huge crush on her boss at the law firm. While on Mure, Flora has to make a lot of decisions about what to do with her life. As she gets caught up in daily life at the farm and in the town, she has to decide whether she was met to live a small life in the big city or learn to live where she was meant to be. I have read a lot of books by Jenny Colgan but this was one of my favorites. Even though it appears to be a light read, the author grapples with several difficult themes throughout the book.

About the only thing that seemed similar is that the MC has brothers (three) and they are all a bit backward and rough-around-the-edges but otherwise...??? Beyond that, it's a sweet story about Fora, who fled the quaint island community of Mure for London, to get away and over the heartbreak of losing her mother. Working as a paralegal, she is in love with her bosses boss who is a jerk and is forced to come back to Mure to lend help on a case. She finds her mother's recipe book and soon her passion for cooking is parlayed into a pop-up cafe (to get her client on the good side of the townspeople) called the The Cafe By the Sea. I don't want to go into much more detail as if you like Colgan's books and characters, you will likely enjoy this one. It isn't my favorite of her novels but it is fun and full of tasty food, and it makes me want to move to a Scottish isle. ;-)Some quotes I liked:\"As Charlie turned to go, she was struck by something--excitement and happiness at the lovely day, and the weird amazingness of being surrounded by things she made herself, even though this wasn't, she told herself, her real job, her real life.\"\"He's a very handsome man,\" said Lorna. \"You'll have to keep him out of Inge-Brit's clutches.\" \"She smells of bacon,\" said Flora petulantly. \"Oh yeah, men hate that,\" said Lorna.\"And if Human Resources get to hear about it...I mean you know what pricks they are.\" \"That's because you slept with two people in Hr.\" \"And they were pricks about it!\""}, {"userName": "Jerrie (redwritinghood)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1072080-jerrie-redwritinghood", "userReview": "This is the second book I\u2019ve read by this author.

Her latest North American release is The Cafe by the Sea.What makes Colgan's books such a delight to read? Her characters first and foremost. There's always a fun female lead facing decisions, both professionally and personally. This time 'round it's Flora, born on the remote Scottish island of Mure. When her mother died, Flora fled to London to pursue her career. Three years on she hasn't returned, even for a visit. But when her boss (yes she does have a crush on him - this is another integral part of Colgan's books - the romantic will they, won't they component) sends her there for work, she is forced to confront her past - and look to her future. (Another few pieces of the feel-good read - conflict and heart-string tugging.)Flora is a perfect lead - fun, quirky and very likable. The supporting cast also endears themselves to the reader - Flora's loud and noisy family, the townsfolk - and two other possible romantic entanglements......The grief and loss Flora is experiencing over her mother's death is very well written. Anyone who has suffered such a loss will find themselves shedding a tear or two. But there's lots of joy as well - rediscovering that place we call 'home' and finding your own passion - the thing you were meant to do. The title gives you a pretty broad hint of what Flora's passion might be. Colgan's description of the joy of food and baking was, well, mouthwatering! The descriptions of Mure are vivid, bring the imaginary isle to life - and had me wanting to visit. And who doesn't love a good romantic tale - the meandering path to true love - all the while knowing that yes, there's a happy ending. But sad for the reader when the end is reached. More please!The Cafe by the Sea is the perfect summer (okay, really anytime) read - engaging, touching, joyful, romantic, humourous and more. Loved it! (And I have to say that I look forward to reading the note from the author at the beginning of Colgan's books - her warmth and wit shine through and add a personal note to the novels.)"}, {"userName": "Sky", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38680200-sky", "userReview": "I love Jenny Colgan her books are always such a delight to read, so I was super excited to be able to get the chance to review this book. A huge thankyou to Netgalley and Hatchette Australia for a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. Flora has escaped her hometown Muir a beautiful little place in the Scottish Isle. She has moved to London to fulfill her dream of becoming a Lawyer but so far has only seen herself working as a Paralegal. Her life is far from perfect, her job isn't all that she thought it would be and Flora is madly in love with her boss who doesn't even know she exists!Her boss takes on a new client who is doing work on Muir and Flora is sent home to try and get the locals on board with the client's ideas. Flora is faced with her past and having to finally deal with the grief of losing her Mother. While home Flora discovers her mother's Recipe Book and in doing so she heals not only her wounds but her families and pulls Muir together as a community. She might even get herself her own happily ever after.What wasn't there to love about this book! The characters were all delightful and Jenny has such a way with words when it comes to bringing them all to life. They all seem so realistic. I really enjoyed following along with Flora and learning about her past. She was such a sensitive soul who came across as being down to earth, honest and genuine. It's so easy to get absorbed in the pages and i found myself not being to put this book down for very long at all. Another great book by Jenny Colgan highly recommend reading."}, {"userName": "Rachel Gilbey", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5801320-rachel-gilbey", "userReview": "So glad that I finally found the time to read this book as I have been meaning to since the moment I bought it! First let me just say the whole Isle of Mure sounds like a brilliant setting, its remote, its got gorgeous men on it, its has a rustic charm and generally feels so removed to regular life, would be a great place for a holiday. It took about 30 pages, and then I was completely hooked on this book. I loved the different brothers and their personalities, and the history behind Flora having stayed away from the island for so long. There are multiple men that Flora could end up with which added to the fun of the book. And the Summer Seaside Kitchen, was such an inspired idea and features a rather special recipe book, and features down to earth, non pretentious food! This is another wonderful book by Jenny Colgan that I thoroughly enjoyed."}, {"userName": "Christina (Confessions of a Book Addict)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2418140-christina-confessions-of-a-book-addict", "userReview": "Flora has left behind her small Scottish island where she grew up and that's a good thing, because she can start over in London, where no one knows her.
