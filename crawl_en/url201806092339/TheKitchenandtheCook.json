The first book, \"The Kitchen Book\", reads much the same-- an entertaining biography of a cook in post-war France and England.Much of the book is the very entertaining minutiae of keeping a decaying French hotel or a ill-conceived restaurant afloat. In both cases, Freeling writes candidly of his professional short comings and how they're dampened or amplified by the various personalities orbiting these businesses. The companionship outweighs the hardship, but not by much-- but Freeling's prespective keeps it from feeling weighed down.This is one of the few books I've read more than once.The second book, \"The Cook Book\", is an effort by Freeling to create a cookbook entirely devoid of measurements. There's a lot that can go wrong and it's not as friendly a read although it has some very entertaining passages. For the most part, if the subject is a dish you've cooked or want to cook, then it works. If you're interested in cookbooks like this Nigel Slater hits a homerun with Appetite-- very highly recommended."}, {"userName": "^", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5069314", "userReview": "I absolutely loved \u201cThe Kitchen Book\u201d, but found \u201cThe Cook Book\u201d a bit more of a ramble. Freeling\u2019s turn of phrase is sharp and pithy as he describes his early career working in kitchens; \u201che was quartering boiled potatoes with of all things a long ham knife\u201d (p.92, KB). What a wonderful picture?! One feels that there is much wisdom within the pages of The Kitchen Book. And much give and take; \u201cAll cooks like to show off virtuosity, and restaurants encourage them since it is good publicity. The horrors begin to creep in when all this art forgets about the nose and only clamours for the eye\u2019s attention.\u201d No change from today, then. This is definitely a book which every catering student would benefit from reading; and be thankful for their training in an educational establishment prior to their final knocking into shape in a restaurant or hotel kitchen.The Cook Book is quite different. Freeling muses on the practice of cooking dishes. Unsurprisingly this acts to remind the reader that many (but not all) culinary tastes and methods have radically changed over the last forty years; though he writes so interestingly (even bringing in the legends of King Arthur) that his reader is more than happy to both wallow in nostalgia \u2026. and wonder if some present day \u2018improvements\u2019 actually are?"}, {"userName": "David R.

The Kitchen Book and The Cook Book have long been favorites of mine. That they will appear under one cover, with the original illustrations, is fine news indeed.

Hilarious narrative of some grand old hotels where the system reigns supreme - from process to price, the system keeps staff, costs and food all in line. Some unforgettable characters eking out yet another dish from bits and pieces - croquettes, stews and soups. The kitchens themselves, often so antiquated that I wonder how it was possible to work, and the forgotten stretches beneath are mesmerizing and haunting. Freeling writes of the grand old hotels in their last days.Published in the 70s, these two classics of gastronomy covered Freeling's early, pre-crime fiction career in the post war period.A must read!\n--Ashland Mystery"}, {"userName": "J", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1109787-j", "userReview": "Entertaining snapshots of life as a cook in the old French \u2018System\u2019.
