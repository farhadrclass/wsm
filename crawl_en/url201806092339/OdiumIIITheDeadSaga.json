Each book in this series must be read in order. If you haven\u2019t experienced the first two books in this series, you need to stop reading this review now and come back and read it after you have read the first two books! \n\"Would mankind ever rule this earth again? I doubted it.\"\nAt the conclusion of Odium 2, I felt a range of emotions that I can barely articulate. I was shocked, heartbroken, and nervous with the conflict between Nina and Mikey and the stress of the world they are living in. In this third book, Nina once again shocked me with her ferocious spirit and drive to do what is right despite the threat it would bring to her life and well-being! As Nina and Crunch embark on the big journey, Mikey is out on a scouting mission. Both Nina and Mikey are fighting for the same cause, and yet, they are miles apart from each other both physically and emotionally! The primary threat continues to be the undead who have infested the world with one goal in mind...kill! No matter what happens, Nina is strong and maintains her bad ass personal and witty personality throughout the death and destruction. But is Nina strong enough to survive? Will she and Mikey find their way back together again?\n\"You'll understand why this place needs to burn if you see.\"\nTold in mostly dual POV, Odium 3 is another riveting addition to this explosive series. As each character is introduced and developed within the story, the hope for their survival grows stronger in my heart. Although I have tried not to get \u201ctoo close to anyone\u201d (as we know\u2026no one is safe), my love and hope for these characters just continue to grow. The most addictive element of this series is the witty dialogue and complex plot. In the midst of the chaos and violence, Nina continues to keep things light and humorous even in the darkest of moments, and I am always sitting on the verge of crying, laughing, or peeing my pants from fear. Claire C. Riley brings the five senses to life with every single turn of the page. You will be completely transported to another place and time! Overall, I highly recommend Odium 3 to readers who enjoy suspense, action, and aren\u2019t opposed to a little blood and guts! Nina is the strongest heroine I have ever met, and you will experience a feeling of camaraderie with the characters like no other when you dive into his world. I will warn you the ending in this installment left me terrified for what\u2019s to come. Luckily, Odium 4 is out and loaded on my Kindle.

It was Dark, disturbing, sad, heartbreaking, passionate and brought the fears of the characters to the forefront more so than before, (With hints of humour sprinkled into this dark world).

Odium III is another amazing, gory, emotional zombie ride from Claire C. Riley. The story picks up with Nova and Nina on their little trip to find a certain lady with a certain bun in the oven. Obviously a spoiler if you haven't read the first two. But if you haven't read them, then while the hell are you looking at the third book anyway. :p Nina is still her unapologetic bitch self. And I love it. Her gooey middle shows, but she's not bleeding her emotions all over the pages in a way that seems out of place for her, or even annoying to read. It's just the way it is. And it's hard to read sometimes, but that's because Claire has really managed to put her readers in Nina's shoes. The action is so intense in these books. So is the gore. So if you're squeamish, umm... sorry. I really want to squee and jump and puke fangirl fairy dust all over the Dead Saga, but that's weird. And inappropriate. Instead I will tell you that this book is my favorite out of the three, and that they only keep getting better and better. And I swear to all that is good in the world, that I will fly across the ocean to Claire, and make her give me a happy(ish) ending. And I hate happy endings.

That being said I\u2019m still trying to wrap my head around everything that happened in the story. I so naively went in hoping and thinking that Claire C. Riley-author extraordinaire, would take us down a different path, a path of least resistance- if you will, but that was so very na\u00efve. What\u2019s the fun in that? Riley wants you to hope and think that everything will be okay, that our tomorrow will be a little brighter. And just as your smile gets a little bigger, your hope grows a little more, and when you look to your left and see someone you love- BAM! It\u2019s chaos! You just keep reading saying nonono, this can\u2019t be happening , but oh man it is and your left with a huge whole where your heart use to be. Well that was me anyways.

Some of the horror is in the lack of humanity and compassion that people living in this world would come to accept as normal behavior and it was written as poetic prose amidst the heartbreak. Life has forever changed and no matter how bad we think things can get for Nina and Nova, it is not even close to the devastation of what these girls encounter or the heartbreaking decisions they are forced to make.Just when I was feeling absolutely gutted, around the 66% mark in the book, I was smiling and crying some happy tears once again (even if for just a brief moment) and realized that even though Riley created this horrible bleak vision of the world, there might still be some tiny shred of happiness to be found.A few other characters come into the picture to provide both comic relief (Joan), a touch of tenderness (Adam), passionate lust (Mikey) and a dangerous man from the past becomes the hand that deals a fatal blow.Ends with another cliffhanger that will make you scream at Claire Riley (how dare she do that?!!!) but know that there will be another installment to carry on and hopefully give us more of a resolution and maybe some peace for Nina and Mikey.I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.***** 5 ***** \"a poetic form of torture and despair\" stars"}, {"userName": "Amy Queau", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17435881-amy-queau", "userReview": "What a ride!I\u2019ve read all the Odium and Odium Origins novels, and the thing I love most about these books is how well thought out the characters are. Nina has always been stubborn and unforgiving, and one of the reasons I have always adored her is because she\u2019s done what she\u2019s needed to in order to survive this post-apocalyptic world; she\u2019s hardened her heart, ignored her spirit, and solidified her bad-assery with a katana.But in Odium III, we see a shift in Nina. She has the zombies mastered, she\u2019s found peace in her decisions, and she\u2019s even made a few friends along the way. And for lack of a better term, she seems grateful for her life.But this is Claire C. Riley we\u2019re talking about here, so don\u2019t think this is going to be all wine and roses. I\u2019m beginning to think that this author can\u2019t write a book without killing some of her most beloved characters. I don\u2019t know if I want to hug her for creating such brilliance, or slap her face.There isn\u2019t much I can say about OIII without giving away the plot, but I can tell you that I was not disappointed with this installment of the Dead Saga. In fact, I\u2019d go so far as to say it was my favorite one yet.This book can not be read as a standalone. I would highly recommend reading all the books in this saga, including the Odium Origins novellas.

Like Claire Riley, I dabble in zombie fiction. Also like Riley, my main character is a strong female lead. So, it's a fair statement to say I tend to prefer reading zompoc told from a snarky, feminine perspective. Odium is an exceptional series that earns its place on the keeper shelf. It tells a well-rounded story with just enough detail to tell the complete tale but not so much that a reader is bogged down with minutia. One of the things I enjoy so much is that while her MC is female, she's written fairly masculine. Guarded, aloof, and--at times--downright rude. But that doesn't mean she isn't likable. My hands-down absolute favorite part of Odium III is the introduction of Joan. She's fabulously funny and adds a much-needed bit of levity to the book. Her quirky dialog had me laughing out loud on more than one occasion. There's a particularly touching moment in Odium III that found me near tears. A mere few lines between Nina and a child that was so eloquently written that it had tugged on my heartstrings before I'd realized what was happening. I'm looking forward to seeing what's next in the Odium series. This one's a keeper.

Just now. I\u2019m still raw and beaten down, and if Claire were here, I would have some choice words for her. This is where I will warn you, as no one had the heart to warn me: This is NOT the last book in the Odium series. For some reason, I thought this was a trilogy, so I had a certain idea in my head about where this book was headed. I was thoroughly confused when it went in the exact opposite direction. The further I got into the story, the more wary I became. Why isn\u2019t Claire tying up all the loose threads? Why have my questions not been answered?! WHY is Nina doing that?! SOMEONE STOP HER!! *Sigh* Did I mention I had choice words? Anyway. That\u2019s your warning.The story started off a little slow, mostly because life kept getting in the way. Apparently a mother is not allowed more than three minutes of unbroken reading at one time. Huh. Anyway, it certainly puts a damper on the tense scenes that Claire is known for. Overall, the pace of the book was a little slower than I was anticipating, but it had a lot of really interesting introspection going on instead. Nina kept flirting with the idea of having hope, before having it dashed on the rocks yet again. This internal back and forth struggle she has going on is both fascinating and painful at the same time. You want her to be happy, to be wrapped up safe in Mikey\u2019s arms, to have all her dreams come true\u2026 but at the same time you know that she has to be hard in order to survive. Nina needs to be protected by her sarcastic, bitter outer shell, and quite honestly, I would be sad to see it go!One tiny detail really stuck with me while reading the first half of the book. Nina gets a cold. It\u2019s such a simple thing, but so overlooked in zombie movies and books! How often does someone have to battle something so mundane, when the overall plot already has the characters running for their lives? I loved it! I can just imagine myself in that same situation. I would be sick ALL THE TIME, while fleeing through a winter rain, undernourished and overly stressed. How are ALL the characters not sick ALL the time?!At this point, I\u2019m going to assume that you have all read a book by Claire Riley. Yes? If you haven\u2019t, you need to pick one up right this second. She has a very distinctive style, filled to the brim with personality and flair, with a touch of sarcastic bite. Odium III did not disappoint. There was dreadful foreshadowing right from page one (dum dum duuuuuum), and I just knew that my heart was about to get broken. Quick! Cut all ties! Maybe if I don\u2019t love them, Claire won\u2019t kill them! She is ruthless when it comes to sacrificing her characters, but I love how absolutely realistic that is. Just because everyone\u2019s rooting for you, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re safe.Claire, I love you. But I also really, really hate you. I\u2019ll forgive you, though, if you can get Odium IV into my hands by September.A copy of this book was provided by the author in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9481759-laura", "userReview": "It occurs to me that when I read post-apocalyptic zombie stories, I am not really reading them because I find the undead terrifying. I think for me it's a fascination following the characters scavenging through all those places that now stand empty and the lawlessness that follows such a rapid decrease in population. But if they are to be included I think it's important to do them up right so to speak, and this is something the author did really well. This may be one of the only zombie series that illustrates the stench that would likely be present in this situation. Not only does she include it, she also includes scenes in which the characters are literally gagging from it, if not out-right puking. She also never got too technical regarding what caused the dead to rise. She just kept it simple and I like that. Sometimes I think too much emphasis is spent trying to sell the science of it all and this can cause contradictions that end up being unbelievable. There were so many aspects included in this series that lots of times never get addressed in this genre. I always secretly wonder about these things, I don't know why. This author addressed them and I appreciated it, although it wasn't necessarily pleasant to read about, for example a lack of toilet paper. It wasn't overly-descriptive and she never really went into very much detail about other things lacking that we certainly take for granted, tampons etc..but she still put that unwashed, unclean feeling into the series which just helped to illustrate how dire the circumstances really are. I think the series was better for it, and because of this, it was easier for me to believe this story coming from the point of view of a woman. I really liked Nina. She was a bitch. She really was, but she never spent any time feeling sorry for herself. I think her bitchiness might have been a way to hold on to her humanity somewhat. She was a bitch before the world ended and she's a bitch after. She did have her moments though when she was caring and kind. She was no Mary Sue either. She could barely shoot to save her life and couldn't hit the target until it was almost on top of her. There were other times that she really pissed me off. Sometimes she could be downright hateful. She had a tendency to constantly want to go off on her own which got old but was understandable due to constantly watching people die. I really hated the cliffhanger ending but soon realized that there is another book coming out. So at least there will be some resolution but I won't get my hopes up. This author has no qualms whatsoever about killing off characters right and left."}, {"userName": "Ozsaur", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17781193-ozsaur", "userReview": "[SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERSEmily Rose was one of the reasons I liked this series. I loved how she changed Nina and helped her grow. Nina not only stopped growing, but she seemed to go in reverse in this book. Emily Rose was an important part of the series for me, and to have her killed, without getting a single scene in the book no less, was the exact moment this series was over for me.There was no point to her death except to add more pain and angst for Nina. For all Nina's overblown dramatics when she finds out, she was pretty damn quick to jump on Mikey's dick after. And her with serious injuries, too. I was completely disgusted with Mikey after the second book, and I hated that Nina took him back with barely an apology. Hell, she apologized to him! Screw that! Oh, and the whole zombie baby thing was so telegraphed that I got bored waiting for the big reveal, which wasn't big because it wasn't at all surprising. And after Nova killed it and Deacon, Nina got all high and mighty about it. Fuck off, Nina. Deacon murdered a whole town full of people, including children.

Riley. Every book she puts out destroys me entirely. Like rips me apart completely. I feel more emotion reading her books than I have ever felt reading any other book. Odium III is no different. I hate that I can feel so torn up about a book and love it at the same time. I think I love it when she tortures me. Odium III has so many great elements. There is a good amount of action, but it\u2019s not a constant battle in the typical sense. Most of the actual battles occur within the characters heads. These characters are so freaking messed up in the head it\u2019s not funny. But at least they come by it honestly. They have every reason in the world to be messed up. In this book we are given much more insight into Nova\u2019s personality, and I really love her character. She is so bad ass. We are introduced to Joan, aka \u201ccrazy pants\u201d. She is a very interesting character. She provides good comic relief, that\u2019s for sure! Nina is still whining. I know she\u2019s a main character, but I really don\u2019t like her. She\u2019s a walking disaster. I don\u2019t know how she has managed to survive this long. She is such a depressing character. She reminds me of Debbie Downer from Saturday Night Live. The action scenes are very intense. There are some amazing scenes in this book that will leave the reader open mouthed with shock. I am still shaking my head in disbelief over this book. It\u2019s not just one scene that did this to me. It\u2019s several. I just can\u2019t believe some of the scenes. Odium III is a great book. It picks up right where Odium II left off and carries the story forward flawlessly. If you haven\u2019t started reading this series, you really should. I can\u2019t think of another series that I can honestly say that I feel this strongly about. Every time a new book in the series comes out, I get this feeling of joy and dread all at the same time. I\u2019m almost afraid of what I will find once I start reading! I do know that despite my unhappiness about certain things, Claire C. Riley has never disappointed me.

Friends, if you are into the apocalypse, then I suggest you catch on to this series in a hurry.I'll skip a lot of the preliminary stuff, and assume you've read some of this series. We know Nina is a former resident of a walled in city, she's connected and fallen for a man named Mikey. They travel with some friends, and they are on the run from the Forgotten, which is a group of blood-thirsty criminals. The group feels like they may have found a home base with a new group of people, but as we know all too well - things are not always as they appear. At the end of Odium 2 Nina and Nova have taken off in search of a couple from Nova's old camp because they are expecting a child. Now, most of Odium 3 is the story of Nova and Nina, who are alike and different in so many ways. But somehow in this book these two manage to find a friendship. Both women are strong and a bit on the bitchy side. But where Nina is cautious, Nova is more wild and brazen. However, both women are to be admired for their varied strengths. And I like both women. I like that it's not always roses and rainbows and that there are times they hate each other. I like that they find a certain camaraderie that is so important to survive the apocalypse. No man is an island, and if you think you can survive on your own for very long, you are wrong. Claire C Riley really made me laugh throughout this book several times by the way of a character named Joan, a.k.a. Crazy Pants. Oh my goodness, this woman is hilarious. She's a bit off her rocker, but she finds companionship with Nova and Nina, and is on the trip with them. When things get too tense, you can count on Crazy Pants to come through with some comic relief.Odium 3 does not lack on the gore - or the surprises. Riley has definitely brought new situations to the apocalypse, and kept it fresh, dangerous, and exciting. I loved this book from the first to the last page! This is one of those series that I find myself anxious for each new book, her writing is that good. So yeah, if you haven't tried out Riley's version of the apocalypse, it's time you should."}, {"userName": "Becky Stephens", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24779079-becky-stephens", "userReview": "I\u2019m pretty sure too much time elapsed between reading Odium II and Odium III, and there were too many other stories floating around in my head in that time. It took me a while, as I read, to remember how the last book left off. Then, I was crushed when the details came to me\u2014Nina and Mikey were not a couple. As I read, I dared to hope they would reconcile. Just as Nina wavered on her hope for a future, for humanity.Nina is that one character that you truly root for. She\u2019s bitter, sarcastic, and has a short fuse, but she has every right; she has survived so much. Unfortunately, each event has left a mark on her soul, and that shapes her decisions. But, still, I have hope for her. If she has survived this long, she can continue to survive\u2014with or without Mikey.Claire writes each and every character with such detail that I imagine they are standing in front of her as she types away. I don\u2019t necessarily mean she describes them physically. No, it\u2019s more than that. Each character is a deep well of thoughts, emotions, and experiences that it\u2019s impossible to think that they are simply names on a page. No, they must be real people. And, I suppose they are, even if in Claire\u2019s imagination.I\u2019m happy to report that I have read every single book in The Dead Saga series, and they are all filled with three-dimensional characters and gory zombie goodness.

This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review."}, {"userName": "Stormy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5883218-stormy", "userReview": "When Odium III showed up on my kindle finally, I was practically salivating! I couldn't wait to dive right back into Nina's story and watch what happened to her and the gang. I can guarantee you that THIS book will not disappoint. In true Claire C. Riley form, she keeps you hanging on the edge of your seat all through the story. She gives you that roller coaster ride of a book that has you clutching your kindle, crying out in despair at times, and asking yourself WHAT IN THE WHAT!?!? Laughing out loud at Nina's snarkiness, and praying to the Kindle Gods for them not to take your favorite characters.Odium III Begins where Odium II left off. But shortly after you dive into this you realize that Nina is changing and developing into a character far from where she began. The great thing about the Dead Saga Series, and Claire C. Riley's awesome writing abilities is that just when you think you have it ALL figured out, the scene changes, something crazy happens, and she takes you on another crazy ride you never thought would happen within the story she has written. Just when you think you can let your breath go, and the characters can finally breath, so can you. She throws in a twist and makes your heart sink once more.I have never really been a huge fan of stories that move past the Trilogy stage. But this is one series that you will want to sink your teeth into every single book the author puts out. You will want it to keep going and going. I would want to live in Nina's world, you know, if I wasn't going to be chased down by Deaders or the Forgotten! Odium III took me on a crazy emotional ride and I loved every single second of it! I'll be impatiently awaiting the next book in this amazing series!"}, {"userName": "Eli Constant", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16763100-eli-constant", "userReview": "It's hard to give an in-depth review of this book without spoiling some phenomenal and twisty happenings within- not that established fans should be surprised by now. Riley has an innate (almost infuriating) ability to make us (her fans & readers) fall in love and like with her characters and then face-punch us like a well-worn heavy bag in a testosterone-riddled ghetto gym. You'd think we'd be pissed; that we'd wave 'adios' to Riley, unable to take one more instance of 'what the f**k just happened?'Right. Like that's going to happen.Because the truth is... well, we live for that s***t.Let me just say these few things- Nina is in an even darker place- emotionally & physically. Nova is still the zombie-killing ninja we know and love, but a hint of a softer side peeks out and makes us go 'awww, I totes like her more now'. Crazy Pants is a person (that needs a bath and some memory juice). Mikey's still sexy (although we don't see him as much, boo). Some characters that were ever-present in books 1 & 2 play supporting roles instead of being front-and-center, but that doesn't mean they're safe. And the questions (Hilary & Deacon) and cliff-hanger from book 2? Yeah, those are answered and played out in morbid, gut-wrenching, gooey detail that made my heart hurt. I put the book down a few times (that rarely happens to me). Of course... this book also ends with some tears, a cliff-hanger, and a 'Nina... what the crap!?'. D*** you, Riley! So prepare your face, you duct-taped punching bag, Riley's got her gloves on and she likes to leave bruises."}, {"userName": "T.W.

I am not saying this with shock or surprise, I am simply putting down a preface for those who do not realize the amazing talent for capturing the horror market that these women possess. I am in constant awe of how they can bring me (the reader) so deep into a story.Claire Riley has the ability to hook you with such an awesome display of descriptive ability. Her strength resides in her talent at making you hear, see, feel, and smell everything that her heroine Nina encounters. You would be gravely mistaken if you think this might be some \"Harlequin Horror\". Oh no. This is the real deal with grit, violence, and all of the nastiness (in the best way possible) that you want from a horror/zombie tale.As is the hallmark of the best stories in the z-cult, Claire's story is about people. They feel and emote in very real ways that do not ever seem forced.I was blessed to receive an advance copy of this book for review and hope I am equally fortunate when she releases book 4."}, {"userName": "Ken Mooney", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10278361-ken-mooney", "userReview": "Claire C Riley revisits the world she's already shown us in her other Odium books, and this third entry in the series proved to be the most gripping yet. As ever, Riley has an amazing central character, and a sense of everything that character things and feels...and of course, we feel it to.Riley's story is a mix of love and hate, a blend of fear and confidence that comes in a world where zombies have taken over...and where the scariest things are actually the other people who are in this world. Riley is capable of telling thrilling and heart-breaking stories, but I don't want to say much about these without spoiling the first two books in this gripping series.Odium 3 proves one thing to me: Riley is building a world, a world where she knows exactly what she's doing, and which is as engrossing as The Walking Dead or any other zombie apocalypse. This book is a must for rans of Riley or her worlds, but definitely (as with all series) start from the beginning."}, {"userName": "Halima Rahman", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11369249-halima-rahman", "userReview": "\"If there was a heaven, then that meant that there was a God, and if there was a God, what the hell was he thinking letting zombies walk the earth?\"Just when I thought it couldn't get any better, it did! I'm speechless... Wow! Nina's journey becomes darker & more intense and in many ways more reflective and emotional. Through the captivating magic of Claire's writing I felt it all and am still feeling the rawness of every page, the heartbreaking effects of Nina's tragic plight, the irresistible depths of Mikey's feelings, the intensity of Nova. This was the series that pulled me into the Zombie dystopian Genre & I'm so glad it did. Yet again Claire C Riley has taken me on an amazing, vivid and fierce journey through the apocalypse. My only complaint is that I'm now desperate for the next book & I'm not sure I can wait until Winter 2015!"}, {"userName": "Shanna Tidwell", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39871892-shanna-tidwell", "userReview": "It appears that part of my review is missing! Edit:I love this series. I was given book 2 & bought 1 & 3. Worth every penny. This is one of my favorite zombie series. Wasn't expecting a book 4 because it said 'trilogy' on the cover. Can't wait to finish the books on my list so I can buy it & start on it. That being said I know not all series can go on forever..... but still! Damn! I actually loved the narrator even though I wasn't happy with the change in book 3. It's usually frustrating. Still she did an excellent job. This one just left me wanting more and I don't think I'm going to get it."}, {"userName": "Stephanie Maynard", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30209199-stephanie-maynard", "userReview": "Omg!!I love this whole series and I'm so mad at how it ended. I am not a patient person so I hate that I have to wait for next book. The ending to this made me mad. I bit my lip till there was nothing left lol. The suspense killed me I cannot believe everything mind Nina and Nova and Mikey and just everyone went thru. Joan cracked me up for sure haha. Seriously tho this is an amazing suspenseful series that will make u scream, cry, hope, love, and everything. WHY DID IT HAVE TO END THAT WAY? I need the next book like now.

I am chomping at the bit to start number four, especially with how this one ended, leaving us with no clue how it went, except our imaginations.This continues to be one of my all time favorite zombie series. But I have to wonder if Nina would really do what she did in the end. I'm hoping some miracle happens and she survives.I have read this for the THIRD time, definitely one of my all time favorite zombie apocalypse series. But to end this book as it did just made no sense to me this time again. Why does she go into that mall alone? What does she hope to achieve? I see no rationale for this.

I'm obsessed with where Nina will go. The awesome thing about these books is you have no idea what will happen. Seriously. You don't know what characters will make it. Who will survive who will die and all through it you are their cheerleaders. the story picks up from the last and it emotionally draws you in and it's a total page turner, up all night situation. No one is safe. I laughed in some parts. Was mad in others and ended with a sob. I can not wait until winte.
