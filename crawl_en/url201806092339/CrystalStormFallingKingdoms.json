Are you kidding me. Someone get me a TARDIS or something because I cannot wait another year after that.Aaaargh ok ok no big spoilers. This story in a nutshell: lots of people are either killed, back from the dead, or in the process of dying.(I avoid major spoilers but do mention a couple very basic plot points from the start of the story since this is a review. So if you were voluntarily seeking out reviews hoping to not see ANYTHING about the book, you might want to click away). Anyways, this book was pretty short and there are a lot of POVs, so everyone's story only moved forward a little bit overall. I'm not going to sum up everyone's plot because this is book #5 and if you're reading this you probably know the rebel movement(s), how the Damoras aren't in power any longer, and how everyone's got plans for releasing the magic from whatever crystal they currently have (or plan on stealing).Magnus and Cleo are trying to figure out their new relationship at the start of the story when Gaius informs them that Cleo's mom had a curse on her that killed her in childbirth and the same thing will happen to Cleo. So that puts a nice solid obstacle between Magnus & Cleo since he doesn't want to ever risk getting her pregnant or losing her. Cleo's also a lot more cautious with her feelings than Magnus, to the point where I was kind of wondering at times just how good of a manipulator she is and whether she's playing everyone too. So their problems are only starting.And then of course EVERYTHING falls apart in the most dramatic way and I love them both so much andUmmm I guess there are other people in the story... Amara's still trying to take over the world. Lucia's pregnant with some Renesmee baby that's growing super fast. Jonas is still attempting to do his thing (\"It seems he's the one most likely to be injured at any given time\"). And Gaius seems to have had a slight change of heart after dying and actually looks kind in comparison with his psychotic mother. There were just a LOT of characters here and I'd recommend skimming through Frozen Tides quickly before picking this up so you remember everyone. Most of their stories all end up coming together, though, which makes most of the POVs cover the same plot. So that was nice. But ok back to Magnus... seriously, this entire series is worth reading just for his sassy comments. Pretty sure Magnus & Dorian from ToG are the two top characters who just need a hug and/or break at this point. But I have to admit that I really wasn't that into the parts of this book that didn't have Magnus. It kind of dragged in parts and didn't cover a ton overall. I think Frozen Tides is my favorite book in this series so far because it felt like more happened, but this one was still good and I just LOVE MAGNUS AND CLEO SO MUCH. HAVE I MENTIONED THIS. I really hope the next book brings everyone I love back from the dead (since this is apparently no big deal) and ends happily because these cliffhangers are killer.Thank you to the publisher for sending me an advance finished copy!"}, {"userName": "Melissa \u2665 Dog/Wolf Lover \u2665 Martin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin", "userReview": "Reread Okay, let me just say this two times! Or let the gifs say it for me !! I couldn't figure out whether to go with a 4 or a 5 star review so I kept it at 4. Things that happened in this book! **NO SPOILERS**Sooooooo, that ending. Yeah, where's the next freaking book now! OMG! And I want to know what is going to happen to Lucia because she's got some stuff going on peeps, some stuff goin' on! I need to know what's going to come out of her! Then we have some evil kindred dude causing all kinds of chaos, not to mention stupid Amara, how 'bout we just don't mention Amara. Anyhoo, this evil kindred dude wants to set loose his other kindred peeps and put them in our friends bodies and who knows what the hell else from there! I mean he's this evil god dude thing and they need to defeat him and try to figure out how to fix something that he started! I'm worried about some of my other favorite characters even more now! <---- I can't say why. And for the love of all that is holy can we get rid of King Gaius once and for all. (and Amara) He just doesn't seem to die and there are reasons people. Reasons for everything in this book. Although, I will give him a cookie for one good deed he did, he broke a neck, an evil neck. So there you go. There are people and things that I have been leaving out of the reviews so you can meet those people and things for yourself. There are some crazy times in this series. We have some people coming back from the dead. Some people being killed, are they going to come back from the dead, people being possessed, can we un-possess them later. I don't know anything, or how to spell so deal with it. I really am rooting for a few people in this series and I hope they make it and things go well. Oh and Jonas is still bumbling around being Jonas. I don't know what it is but he gets on my nerves. He's not bad he's just . . . I don't know. And now he's got some stuff going on and I'm like, NO! DO NOT DO ANYTHING COOL LIKE THAT TO HIM. Just leave him be to bumble around and do what he does. Lol. He really is a good guy, I just pick on him because he's not all that bright with the things he says and does. So now, I have to wait another year or whatever for the next book!!!!!!!! Why!!!!!!!

A storm of confusion, anger, vengeance, magic, love and greed. Power is a devious thing. It can corrupt the purest soul, cloud the sharpest mind, make everything seem pale compared to the knowledge, the intoxicating feeling that you can bend anything and anyone to your will. And that's what the Kindred, what the elemental deities offer. But this power always comes with a price. The land of Mytica is in the brink of destruction. The new empress is ruthless, and the forces that can stop her don't trust each other in order to work together. Loyalties are tested. Convictions are shaken. And a sorceress, a rebel, a golden princess and a dark prince are caught in the eye of this storm.\n\n\u201cPower is all that matters, Magnus. Legacy is all that matters.\u201d\n\nIt is no secret that the Falling Kingdoms series holds a special place in my heart. I am always able to lose myself in Morgan Rhodes's epic tale, a tale infused with legends, gods and mortals, intrigue and power games. Her ingredients? Deception, manipulation and secrets and you question even your most beloved characters. Deaths and resurrections and your jaw drops to the floor. Magic, raw magic and your fingers tingle with the anticipation, the need to unleash it and wreck havoc. Greed and love in an eternal and lethal dance. And morally grey characters.\n\n\u201cI think we all deserve to die for something we've done. Or for something we've failed to do.\u201d\n\nWhere I come from, when something impossible happens we say that \"a bakery must have been demolished\" (don't ask me why, we're weird people). Well, in Crystal Storm's case I think that every single bakery in Mytica mush have been demolished, because I never expected the day would come when Jonas Agallon would be the most sensible and levelheaded character. But it's true. He was reasonable, and tried hard to not let the bitterness he harbored and his pain guide him and lead him to dark paths. Can't say the same for Lucia though, who was still a psycho bitch, but she did try to make amends for the mayhem she created and the innocent blood in her hands, so maybe she can return to the decent human being she was once upon a time.\n\n\u201cTrue leaders often must be ruthless enough to steal and murder. If they don't, someone else will.\u201d\n\nAnd that's Magnus, my precious cinnamon roll. His philosophy is still the same,he's dark and moody and prone to violence, but his complexity, the battle between light and darkness he keeps fighting, are some of the many reasons I love him so much. And so does Cleo. They have some wonderful scenes together, but unfortunately it was Cleo that prevented me from giving Crystal Storm the fifth star.She's been my favorite heroine since book 1. Yet, I found her really spiteful and greedy, sometimes acting like the spoiled child she once was, and all these horrible things she said to Magnus, and her constant desire to hide her feelings for him because she was ashamed really disappointed me. Of course Magnus is not an easy-going, charming fellow, but he needs someone to believe in him, and Cleo's faith sometimes wavered. I still ship them though. Hard.\n\n\u201cLove is pain. Love is death. And love strips one of their power.\u201d\n\nAnd since I love all these flawed characters, you can imagine how I'm going to spend the months until the final book's release.Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | BookNest"}, {"userName": "Riley", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23179211-riley", "userReview": "I AM READY NOW FOR IMMORTAL REIGN !!!"}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3030788-melanie", "userReview": "1.)

Frozen Tides \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Out of all the feelings I expected to have while reading Crystal Storm I never thought disappointment would be one of them, or the most prominent. Crystal Storm was, hands down, no question, my most anticipated book of 2016. It was even on my rough draft list of \"best books published in 2016\" because I was so confident it would be perfection incarnate. Oh, how wrong I was.Instead of perfection, we got plot holes, unnecessary angst between Cleo and Magnus, a cliffhanger ending that felt like Empire of Storms part two, and twists that I feel bad even calling twists because they came out of nowhere and were so unexpectedly bad. I'm so let down that I'm actually at a loss for words.And what makes it worse is that this book has Magnus on the cover. How can anything with a picture of Magnus Damora be less than perfection? I mean, I know 2016 was a bad year for most of us, but this... this I never saw coming.Anyways, this is the fifth book in the Falling Kingdoms series that, until this point, have only gotten better and better. This series follows four young adults and their different inner struggles for power, vengeance, and love. We also have some side characters along for the ride. A lot of people compare this series to a young-adult Game of Thrones, and I think that description is pretty accurate. One of those four main characters, Magnus is one of my favorite characters ever written. His internal struggle, but the way the others perceive him from his outward actions, is one of the best things I've ever read in my life. He is, and always will be, my little cinnamon roll that is far too good for this world.\n\n\u201cI want you,\u201d he whispered against her lips. \u201cI want you so much I may die from it.\u201d\n\nSeriously, all I want for Christmas is Magnus Damora. Please, Lord, help me with this unhealthy thirst for a fictional character. The only person, besides the perfect Magnus, that I even overly enjoyed was Amara. Like, I understand she was sort of the villain, even though now her dynamic is quite shifted (oh please, Felix, give me the good angst.) My favorite types of villains are the villains that make sense, and Amara, to me, makes perfect sense. She comes from a long line of female oppression, and she is finally able to pave her own path. Seeing the continued abuse by her own subjects, just because of her gender, made for a really good read, and she really wormed her way into my heart. I have nothing but high hopes for her (and Felix) for the final installment.\n\n\u201cIt is never too early for girls to learn to speak their minds. It\u2019s a habit that will make them braver and stronger as they grow up.\u201d\n\nSurprisingly, Lucia's POV was pretty enjoyable, too. I even shed a few tears while a certain prophecy was being told and acted out. Jonas was also amazing, and I loved how he stepped up. Also, he always knows what to say. Both of these characters really stood out among all of the forced twists and plot devices. I actually hated a lot of characters in this book: I hated Nic; he's such a little weasel. I hated Taran; talk about more unnecessary angst. I borderline hated Ashur, just because of his action at the end with Cleo. I still hate Gaius, because nothing has changed even though the story wants you to believe it has. And I obviously hated the out of the blue villain that Morgan Rhodes decided to sloppily write in. Elena, Cleo's deceased mother, is obviously a key to much more that we don't realize yet. Cleo is most likely going to turn out to be even more of a special snowflake from the events that took place at the end of this book. But as long as she doesn't keep starting stupid, pointless drama, and keep pushing the paragon that is Magnus away, I won't hate her. I mean, even with all the disappointments this book had, I'm still too invested to stop right before the final installment, but I for sure won't have as high of hopes as I did for Crystal Storm, and it won't be making any of my anticipation lists.Blog | Twitter | Tumblr | Instagram | Youtube | Twitch"}, {"userName": "Mikee Andrea (ReadWithMikee)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44137919-mikee-andrea-readwithmikee", "userReview": "***No spoilers. Just major, incoherent fangirling. I apologize in advance.***\nOKAY. WTF WAS THAT ENDING??? I swear to god, Morgan Rhodes will be the death of us all.First off, I just wanted to say that going into Crystal Storm, I didn't think it would even come close to being my favorite book in this series. I actually found the first 150 pages to be painfully slow and pointless to the point where I was ready to dock off a star for the pacing alone. BUT once we did surpass 150 pages, SHIT WENT DOWN. I couldn't put the book down at all. I thought Crystal Storm would suffer from the \"middle book syndrome\" or \"the book before the finale syndrome\" but boy have I never been so wrong in my life! Morgan Rhodes does not know how disappoint. Although she does know how to make you hate her and love her at the same time. So there's that.If you know me and my obsession with the Falling Kingdoms, you would know that I live for Magneo. So let me just say that no matter how many cute and steamy moments we get between Magnus and Cleo, IT WILL NEVER BE ENOUGH. I seriously just need a book with just Magneo from beginning to end. I don't care about anything else or anybody else. Like, what's a Lucia? I can seriously forget about everyone else in the book and just immerse myself in everything Magneo. It hurts. It really hurts to be a Magneo shipper. My love for them knows no bounds.Okay, let me be serious for one second because I can't be fangirling like this throughout my whole review. XD No more mentions of Magneo after this. Promise.I thought this book wouldn't even come close to topping Frozen Tides but now that I finished this book and had some time to think about it, Crystal Storm just might be my new favorite book in the series. I surprise even myself. Just seeing how short this book was compared to the other books in the series, I was so sure that I would be in for the biggest disappointment ever, but nope. Not even close. That one year of waiting was worth the wait and now we're back to the waiting game once again. :'(Also, this book was annoying. I loved it. But definitely the most annoying book I've ever read lol. The characters are all infuriating. Except for Magnus because he is the epitome of perfection. No one is worthy of him. Well, except for Cleo but let me hold myself back before I start fangirling about Magneo again.Anyways, infuriating. All these peasants. Lucia, as always. Amara might actually be even more annoying than Lucia. Jonas was actually useful in this book. Nic was and always has been irrelevant to me. Ashur was ???. Felix was a precious cinnamon roll that I didn't expect to steal the show with his witty, hilarious lines. Cleo was great as always except for the last 50 pages (like girl, what were you even thinking?). Magnus was perfection. OMG. That reminds me.MAGNUS. MY POOR BABY. I'm sorry you have to endure your... predicament for a whole year but we're with you every step of the way suffering as much as you until next December.I don't know how Morgan Rhodes does it but the Falling Kingdoms series never fails to improve with each book. Not a lot of authors can pull off a six-book series but holy crap does Morgan have us wrapped around her finger. Just when you think she can't surprise you anymore, she pulls all this shit and leaves you with all these feelings for a year. We're all going to be in for such a treat for the finale. I bet Morgan Rhodes is just chilling and plotting our demise and ways she can rip our hearts out in the final book because that ending though...DYING. I'm dying, I tell you! I can't even write a proper review right now with all these feelings.

EoS and now this? Bloody hell. 2017 better bring us some happiness. Alright. There will be some spoilers up to book 4 in here and I'll try to be vague about the rest.If it has been a while since you read the first four books- I recommend doing a skim at least of the last book. There are seriously so many characters and I had a little trouble getting back in to the world. This picks right back up on the cliffhanger in book 4 and there are some small recaps but honestly I forgot who I even cared about. Lie. Really I only care about Magnus and Cleo. I'm pretty sure most of the fandom agrees. If those are the characters you are attached to- I think you'll like this book. I remember not caring in the slightest about any of the other characters and was in agony though any POV that wasn't either of them in other books. This book actually felt a bit more bearable because Mags and Cleo darling seem to be the focus in this one (thank goodness) so even the other POVs revolve around them for the most part. (More on them later...)I'm actually happy to report that Lucia was mildly tolerable in this book too. She is feeling a little remorseful for what all went down before, and it was *semi* interesting to try and figure out what path she will choose now. Don't get me wrong- I still can't stand her. Jonas actually was kinda useful in this one *gasp* and I was kinda interested in him finally. My least favorite bits were Amara's POV. Blah blah, I get it... you hate men... you want to rule everything... yada yada. Everyone else seemed to be tools to move along the story but the book was so short it didn't drag too much. On that note - no one is safe, yet again. Plenty of death if you're here for that kinda thing.Back to more important matters...I absolutely loved the direction the author went for Magnus and Cleo- though it thoroughly wrenched my heart. Just because they \"got together\" in the fourth book and confessed their love DOES NOT MEAN things are smooth rolling for them. Magnus is still so very wounded from his past and Cleo faces some difficulties that make them doubt each other. They very obviously love each other but the relationship struggles in this were so painful. But you know what? That makes the good moments so worth while... and there are some GOOD moments. Not to mention- they still have some heated banter which YES I LOVE IT UGH. The best part which I applaud Rhodes for is THEY DID NOT ONCE GET CHEESY like so many couples after they get together. THAT ENDING WHAAAAAAAT WAS THAT. Okay but I'm hopeful because that just can't be it. That's all I can say without being emotional. My only complaint aside from some of the boring POVs throughout the series is the writing. Maybe it is just me- but I feel like Rhodes tries too hard with some of her dialogue. So much of it just feels unatural/cheesy. The writing isn't the strongest either but whatever- Magnus and Cleo make up for any series shortcomings. It also tends to be a little under descriptive at times which confused me - especially during some of the high action scenes towards the end. Lastly, yep... playlist for Magnus (and some Cleo feels..) because I can't not do it. Check it out Here! if you want to give it a listen!

And for those friends who are getting ready to embark on this wonderful journey (*cough* Brittney, Pea *Cough*)-SPAM ME. 'kay bye.I feel like its so far and few between that I get a chance to write a (well thought out) review for a book I love. For example, I\u2019ve been sick off and on for five months, and my reading has been basically non-existent\u2026but in the last couple months, I\u2019ve managed to read some of my favorite books this year-and maybe 3 of them have gotten even close to the reviews I\u2019m capable of and that they deserve. So, when I received the email telling me I got one of my most (ummm come on, basically THE book that I pined for most) anticipated reads of this year\u2026I just knew I would give it the best review I could muster.So, this is me taking the opportunity to talk about one of my top book boyfriends this year-Magnus. And doesn\u2019t he deserve the whole review to himself, honestly?? I mean seriously\u2026he\u2019s Magnus, the prince of blood. Do I really need to say anything more?\nWell, I think I do, for those who want to know about more than my darling boy. And let\u2019s be honest-Everyone who reads this series is obsessed with him, and some might only be reading it because of him, so what more can I possibly push?Basically, even after all the trials and tribulations surrounding all the books before\u2026this one broke my heart the most. It was absolutely the most brutal. I\u2019ll admit that it isn\u2019t near as brutal in the way of battle and death and destruction, but more brutal in matters of the heart. My soul was ripped to shreds in more ways than one, and more times than one. I might be a bit of a drama queen, but my heart has always ripped in two when a couple like Cleo and Magnus, so in love, have to keep themselves a secret with literally everyone around them. \nThis was definitely a tremulous chapter for the new couple, bringing heartaches and new issues bubbling to the surface. But not once did my confidence in them waver. Not once did I think one or the other would cheat (even with easy access) or give up on their new love. And not once did I think they wouldn\u2019t believe in the best of each other, in the end, keeping their relationship stronger than ever. But I did foresee some bumps in the road...and that prediction aimed true.\n \u201cAnd you listen to me, Princess.\u201d Gaius\u2019s voice followed her like a rancid odor. \u201cThis love you think you feel for my son? The day will come when you will have to choose between Magnus and power. And I know, without a doubt, that you will choose power.\u201d\n\nSo many book series these days drag out unnecessarily for so many books you can\u2019t help but roll your eyes at them-but there are some that shine brighter with each book, building into something so tangible that you can\u2019t breathe when it\u2019s left unfinished. You aren\u2019t thinking, \u2018Oh, come on, another book?!\u2019, you\u2019re rejoicing that there\u2019s another and you have the opportunity to follow the paths these relationships and evil plots continue to pave. This is one of those series.Even as I worried there were going to be too many books when I started this series, I remain surprised each and every time I open a Falling Kingdoms book. They grow dramatically richer and more complex with each additional storyline, and you can\u2019t help but to love each character, good or bad, more with each new installment. For example, had I only stayed on book one, I only would have lightly pined for Magnus. Sure, he was the reason I even considered continuing onward with the story, but I put this series down for a couple months after finishing, if only because there was so much more to read in my TBR pile and nothing had truly hooked me, aside from the not-so-sweet man candy. But, the minute I was urged to continue on, I was immediately hooked. The deep love, the betrayals upon betrayals, the needless slaughters\u2026they spoke to my evil self in a way I\u2019ve not been accustomed to, in a while. This series (and especially these last three stories) touched on so many nerves that I couldn\u2019t help but to be hooked. Now, months later, I\u2019m a ravenous fangirl who can never have enough Magnus and Cleo. I think it\u2019s safe to say who my two favorite characters are, hmm? But even as the series has progressed, I find I have many favorites, especially in this one-Even the evil Amara. There\u2019s just something about an extra feisty bitch added to the character pool that enriches the story and adds just the right amount of turmoil. \nAnd, truthfully, this book wasn\u2019t as action packed as the rest, the more I think about it. In all truth, I think that\u2019s why I loved this book so much and it became my absolute favorite of the 5. We really got time to sit and see where everyone stood, who was loyal and who wasn\u2019t, what relationships were real and which were smoke and mirrors. I even found the guard relationships to be enriching to the story. By our main cohorts all staying in the same place for an extended amount of time, we really had the opportunity to see the chaos as it slowly descended upon them. When a story is just go-go-go, you lose a little something, I think. But as Mags and Cleo sat in one particular area for a prolonged amount of time, surrounded by both friend and foe, we got to see some relationship turmoil that ripped me apart, but filled me with ceaseless obsession for the two. I don\u2019t know why this book spoke to me the most (maybe because I\u2019m messed up in the head and love jealousy so much its sick), but it did, and I already am dying to re-read it and the whole series. I might just do it!! WATCH AND SEE! With a cliffhanger that took my breath away (and made me gleeful, yes I\u2019m THAT crazy and THAT sick) I am already eagerly anticipating how it will all turn out in the final book. Hearts will be broken. Not everyone will survive. Loyalties and friendships will be tried and tested\u2026and I can\u2019t help but long for the final book to be in my hands at this exact moment. It hurts\u2026but I guess I\u2019ll just have to remember all the hot Magneo moments to get me through the next year.

Surprisingly, we saw a slightly different Gaius in this book.I always enjoyed Gaius's character. He is a great villain and I always say that villains decide how strong the plot is going to be. He has always planned something new for our MC but after the rather fatal fall that he survived, his behavior towards Magnus changed somewhat. I actually can't believe I cared for his well-being in the story but it was ultimately for the well-being of my favorite characters because he actually seemed to care about Magnus! Yeah, I know it is kinda difficult to grasp but it is true! =>There is an addition of Selia Damora amongst the Damoras. Gaius's mother, an Oddling and even more cruel than her son if that is even possible but she is. A lot of things happened because of her but I don't want to talk about her a lot. =>Moving on to Jonas..., there is prophesy about him now??? Seriously? It seems only Magnus is the MC without any prophesies popping out of his head! That is sooooo unfair, Rhodes!! You are discriminatory towards my favorite Damora!! -_- Talking about Jonas and the prophesy about him, idk why but I found it bogus. So very bogus! Oh, and I forgot to mention Timothious visited Jonas dreams. I gotta say out of every immortal's visit in a mortal dream, Tim's visit in Jonas were the most entertaining; Jonas attitude toward Tim was hillarious. =>Lucia annoyed the hell outta me in previous books and I can't say otherwise about her in this one. Although Lucia is on her path of redemption, she is still annoying. I also wanted her reunion with her family which didn't happen in this book. There are more prophesies about her that do not interest me one bit to be honest! =>Amara is bitchy more than ever! In previous books, we atleast got to see her vulnerable side, she had none in this one. I was expecting a rekindle of her romance with Felix but that also did not happen. Much to my disappointment, we saw a very little of Felix. =>THE ENDING!!!!Lets not talk about the ending. It wrecked me. I don't want to remember I ever read that. NO. Absolutely not! I haven't read that guys! Not at all. Not yet! I don't know what happened in the last chapter. Don't try to remind me! -_- \nNow, excuse me while I gush over my OTP!\nCleo: \u201cHow do you stand this temperature for so long?\u201d she asked him.Magnus: \u201cIt must be my frozen heart.\u201dCleo: \u201cHere I thought that had melted just a little around the edges.\u201dMagnus: \u201cOh, no. All Limerians have frozen hearts. We melt into puddles in places like Auranos. \u201d__________________________________________________________I love this book and it is not even published yet!

Its common courtesy to not give your  READERS A HEARTATTACK  while they\u2019re reading. Thanks. Crystal Storm  is the fifth book in the  Falling Kingdom\u2019s  series and holds the award, by far, for the most beautiful cover. I don\u2019t think anyone is gonna argue with me on that. I mean just, look . . .  Crystal Storm,  in my humble opinion, is the best book from the series. Where the other books lacked for plots and dramatic endings,  Crystal Storm  made up for it with lots of action, magic, and a heart shattering ending that just leaves you feeling like (\u0ca5\ufe4f\u0ca5)Still using the multiple point-of-views, I found this book to have the most seamless switch from them all. There wasn\u2019t an abruptness with the change in point-of-views like the other books in the series, it was actually quite easy to devour (though it might be bc I\u2019m 110% invested in this series now.)I refuse to reveal much about the plot,  bc spoilers  but I will say that the character development and the friendships and allies and enemies that were made in this book made my head swirl. So much took place in 379 pages (I\u2019m disappointed in the page count too, tbh, need more pages).I must remark on #Mangeo because they are  everything  and we didn\u2019t get nearly enough scenes of them. I didn\u2019t read through 5 books only to have A COUPLE OF MANGEO SCENES. Get yourself together, Morgan Rhodes. I. SIMPLY. NEED. MORE. MANGEO. AND. NOW.Also, protect Mangus.

Magnus and Cleo are an absolute joke. Like who knew this marriage that they were forced into was going to be even more complicated than an arranged marriage? And why does every single male person ever have a massive crush on Cleo? Like she is either \u201cthe most beautiful girl so-and-so has ever seen\u201d or she is \u201ca goddess walking among men\u201d.Like, I get it; she isn\u2019t just an average looking girl. She\u2019s a princess and she happens to be like really pretty. Just like the other princess (Lucia) who is equally a goddess walking among men but with dark hair instead of blonde. Why can\u2019t a princess ever just be average looking?!Anyway, Magnus and Cleo are the ships of all ships. I love their relationship because it wasn\u2019t like an \u201cinsta\u201d thing, it was something that evolved. I mean, they legit hated each other (and sometimes I think they still hate each other). But that\u2019s what makes it so intoxicating! Amara is succeeding in her quest to take over all the kingdoms and be supreme leader of all the lands. Jonas is somehow still alive.. literally have no idea why this guy is still alive.. like seriously does he have nine lives? Why are you a big player in this? I DON\u2019T UNDERSTAND YOUR PURPOSE.Lucia is pregnant with a baby growing inside of her at super speed. That in itself worries me. Like is this a demon that is just going to kill everyone? Because I feel that might be the only way this series can end.Gaius is in the same state that he was at the end of the book; but, you start to see a different side of him besides just supreme evil-ruler overlord. Oh, and you meet his mother: that is a treat in itself.Oh and the dead come back to life; because in the fantasy world, death isn\u2019t permanent the majority of the time. Seriously, I think this is kind of a cheat; but, then again I am usually overjoyed to see a character come back to life. Bipolar feelings for a book is my usual though.Oh and there\u2019s something about the gods of the elements and someone trying to take back their world.Honestly, this world-building has been phenomenal. It has been slow, but it doesn\u2019t leave you confused about anything. The characters have grown a lot since the first book and they never seem to be acting out of their usual. You end up loving the characters for their flaws and stupidity and you morn them when they die (because a lot of people die. Literally the majority of the characters you meet die. Not a drill.). \nAND THAT ENDING\n Like... WHY IS THE NEXT BOOK NOT IN MY HANDS? Cliffhangers are the ABSOLUTE WORSE. Everyone is NOT where they are suppose to be and there is NO happily ever after in this book and I need this to be fixed. DO YOU HEAR ME RHODES?

So far this book is the best in the series.\n\n This review is a pure spoiler. Read it at your own risk. \n\n=> So, Gaius doesn't die in this one as I was desperately hoping. I don't know what to feel about him now after THAT revelation. My hatred for him has dwindled a bit but not nullify yet. Perhaps in the next book, it will.=> Ashur came back from death! I should have guessed how far before him telling it because author had given the hint in the last book. Anyway, I don't think that he played out well in this book. He is just too optimistic. It's a good thing. But sometimes it can be deadly.=> Taran. An unnecessary complication. I felt this way before. But after THAT ending, I think he wasn't that unnecessary. He was a rebel and the fact that he just murdered only one person didn't pacify me. He forgave Magnus. Even though I wasn't completely satisfied by this, I was still happy. Because there was no more threat for Magnus from him.=> Lucia. She did nothing important in this book except for giving birth to her daughter. I am curious that is her daughter a Watcher or a Sorcereres or both or just an ordinary mortal? Last option doesn't sound good to me. But anyway looking forward to it.=> Now two Kindred are free. One of the amazing things happened in this book.=> Water Kindred has become a part of Cleo! Amazing! It means she will be able to control it in the next book. Great!=> Nic. Sometimes he becames a headache for me. I completely understand his reasons. But still sometimes it was difficult for me to handle him. I didn't feel a thing when he was dying. But the aftermath of it wasn't good for me to endure. Then I wished he shouldn't be dead. And thank God Lucia had saved him. Now Fire Kindred has occupied his body. An interesting twist that whether Nic is still alive or not. Honestly, I really wish him dead. I am not seeing any further use of him anymore.=> Jonas. He is the one I liked from beginning of the series. Now he has become a very important character for me in this series. I am happy that he has gained control over air elementia. It's amazing. He and Lucia very much sound like Magnus and Cleo when they talk with each other. Well, No matter what! I still felt the absence of Lysandra here. => Gaius and Elena, Cleo's mother had a story! It was strange yet interesting.=> NOW THE MAIN THING WHICH WILL BE KILLING ME TILL THE RELEASE OF THE LAST BOOK! MAGNUS! What will happen to him?! After THAT ending, I can't stop thinking about it.

Since I have to wait nine long months for the final book, I'll just pretend you never happened. Bye. :) :) :)I'm writing this review and I have a killer headache. Why? Because I stayed up till 4 AM to binge this book, finish it, and cry over it. Bad decision clearly.I have come to realize this series makes me make bad decisions. Especially since I read every single book in less than a day. It's not my fault the series is great and addictive, okay. I was supposed to be adult-ing but I decided to dedicate my day for Crystal Storm. Bad decision again. See? Bad decisions all around. Do I care though?Guys, listen. If you still haven't read this series, what are you waiting for? GO PICK UP FALLING KINGDOMS AND BLESS YOUR LIFE. But, warning: there will be lots of pain. Way, way, way more than joy, to be honest. The series is 98% pain, 2% joy. Morgan Rhodes likes to kill her readers just like she enjoys killing her characters. However, the only confirmed death is my death.Honestly, I just adore this series and I CAN'T BELIEVE THE DAMN CLIFFHANGER IT ENDED IN. I feel so numb. I can't believe I have to live nine more months with this pain. Can I get a time machine, please? I refuse this ending. I have decided to live in denial till Immortal Reign comes out. Excellent idea.The book was so short. Honestly, I needed more. I always need more! Anyway, everything's gone to shit. No one is happy. No one is okay. Everything is just really bad. I do need to mention something important: MAGNEO. Magneo is what I live for. I WILL GO DOWN WITH THIS SHIP, YOU GUYS. They broke me 49288 times over the course of this series. But the greatest pain was in this book. I adore the characters, you guys. Magnus Damora is my favorite. He is my precious baby and I will protect him at all times. He suffers the most in this book and I. am. not. okay. with. this. one. bit. Cleo has developed immensely since book 1. She's so strong and brave now and I just adore her. She's definitely one of my all-time favorite heroines. Lucia is a character I hate but I also love. I wanted to punch her in GD and FT, but in CS, I just wanted to hug her and protect her, because LUCIA IS A SMOL BABY AND DOESN'T DESERVE BAD THINGS. Jonas, oh Jonas... I have a love/hate relationship with him. I hated him greatly in FT, but here in CS? He grew on me again and I found his development great. As for the side characters, Felix is my precious baby. Amara can die for all I care. I really like Ashur but I admit he stressed me out in this book. Nic is so annoying. I understand him and I get the reason behind everything he does. But he still annoys me. As for King Gaius, death to you.It is so difficult to talk about these characters without going into spoilers, hence why I won't discuss the plot. So much has happened in a span of 379 pages and I don't know how Morgan Rhodes managed to do that. Frozen Tides remains my favorite between the books, but Crystal Storm was just as action-packed and perfect.Friendly reminder: Read the books.I just adore this series so much, you guys and thinking about it makes me cry."}, {"userName": "Rachael ( RachaelRexds )", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20373753-rachael-rachaelrexds", "userReview": "UMMMM WHAT WAS THAT ENDING?!?!?!?!??!?!!??!!?!?!!

And she kissed him back without reservation.His hands slid down her sides to her waist, around to the small of her back, and over the curve of her bottom. Frustrated with the necessity to lean over to fully kiss her, he gripped the backs of her thighs and lifted her up into his arms so that her back pressed up against the wall.Surely, she would stop him now.And yet she didn\u2019t. In fact, she\u2019d begun to frantically pull at the ties of his shirt, her mouth not leaving his for an instant.\u201cI want you,\u201d  he whispered against her lips. \u201cI want you so much I may die from it.\u201d\u201cYes . . .\u201d Her breath was so sweet, so warm. \u201cI want you too.\u201d When he kissed her next, all rational thought about the curse vanished from his mind.

He\u2019s going to go out of his mind over this.\u201dCleo stepped away from Magnus, her fingers pressed to her lips and her cheeks bright red.\u201cPlease, Felix,\u201d she said, almost desperately. \u201cPromise me that you won\u2019t tell Nic about this. Not ever.\u201dFelix bowed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, princess. I won\u2019t breathe a word.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dMagnus hid his grimace.

This book was good; it hit all the right points (Magneo scenes <3), but at the same time I thought the book was very poorly planned out because some of the scenes did not make sense or seemed very contrived. It was actually very slow to pick up in the beginning since most of the characters were confined to exchanging barbs in an action-less environment. SPOILERS Warning.The Good. Magnus. What did you expect? He was as sassy and sarcastic as ever. He didn't need killing and fighting to shine. He's a bright star that carried me through the first 50% of the book. His scenes with Cleo were especially cute, especially the haircombing scene and sketch-book note. I thought his concern about Cleo's safety was endearing, but it was pretty obviously a lie/trap so there you go, more forced angst. -eye roll- Otherwise, no complaints on his end. Cleo.  I'm so conflicted. I loved her scenes with Magnus, but I didn't understand the whole need to keep bringing up the whole \"I held a part of heart back despite Magnus being a 101% sweetheart.\" It didn't help that I hated Nic with my entire being, so for her to constantly put Nic's feelings above Magnus's was very annoying. Taran-induced angst to Magneo was actually very minimal compared to what Nic put the couple through. So fuck you very much Nic, you little weasel. Lucia.  Again. Conflicted. I thought her character development was good, but a bit dramatic. Like she literally did a 180 on her personality, going from a bloodthirsty, I-give-no-shits bitch to an apologetic people pleaser. But hey, I guess pregnancy does that to you. I did love the fact that she acknowledged that as fucked up as Gaius was, he was a great father to her. Much better father to her than he ever was to Magnus, so her concern for his well-being, however misguided, was justified. Jonas. Thank fuck for his development. He was literally grating on my nerves for the past 3 and a half books. I honestly had no idea how he even made it so far into the series when everyone else was dropping like flies. He was a lot more mature and knew that you had to make compromises, no matter how much you hated the other person. He was honestly SO MUCH better than Nic when it came to dealing Magnus, considering he probably had a more valid reason at hating Magnus than Nic ever did. However, I felt the reasoning behind his \"magic\" was forced and the only reason he even had it was so that he could be comparable to Lucia. I did think Lucia and him made a good pair. No matter where they end up - frienemies, comrades, lovers, whatever, they were good for each other, especially considering how fucked up they were before in the series.So overall, the four mains were very well done. The Bad.I'm going to keep this short because I could rant for days about certain individuals....-cough- NIC -cough- but I don't want to put in the time or effort into him. Nic. .....There is so much that I need to say, yet so little time. He made Magneo 10x more frustrating than it had to be, always instigating Taran to kill Magnus because he's too much of a coward himself to do it. Basically Nic was a huge coward, and in doing so, made Cleo a coward too. He hated Magnus, but wasn't willing to do anything about it himself because he knew he had no chance. Instead, he kept egging everyone else stronger than him to hate Magnus AND kept making passive-aggressive comments about him. He seemed to hate Magnus more than Gaius himself, the dude who actually killed his sister, for the sole fact that Magnus was \"stealing away\" Cleo... And don't even get me started on his romance with Ashur... Welp, that trajectory felt like a plane crash... It was intriguing in the beginning of the series, but now it was just pathetic and embodied the \"love is blind\" clich\u00e9. Seriously, Ashur was fishy as fuck and EVERYONE (not just Magnus) was telling Nic that he needed to do something about it and get to the bottom of it. Yet, Nic basically followed Ashur around like a love-sick puppy, salivating for attention. He didn't provide ANY intel on Ashur despite him just disappearing one day. Instead, Nic narrow-mindedly blamed Magnus for everything while choosing to protect Ashur despite the fact that Ashur was the guy everyone believed had stolen the Kindred.Ashur. The phoenix. 'Nuff said. I don't think any character made me feel as strongly of \"I can't\" more than Ashur did when he waltzed up to Amara and gave her a \"chance to surrender\" despite knowing she had the upper hand. Like.....you don't bargain from that position unless you want to die. Gaius.  I'm conflicted on his character development. Yeah, it was nice that he stopped trying to kill his son and destroy the world, but I do not understand why he suddenly wanted to act like a father-figure to Magnus right after trying to kill him. He was genuinely concerned about Magnus's future... And all that is going on in my mind is \"Dude, you tried to skewer him 1 week ago, you have absolutely no right to make decisions on Magnus's behalf for the betterment of his future.\"Amara.  I don't know if I hate her because she's the \"villain\" of the story or she was just goddamn annoying. Yeah, she was kind of badass when she stood up to her sexist guards, but she was such a terrible ruler, and that had nothing to do with the fact that she was a girl. She felt like she was lost most of the time, constantly needing guidance from Kyan on what to do next, and always blaming her lack of power/Kindred as the reason for her poor leadership... She didn't really do anything for the people but sit on her pretty throne and give speeches to appease the public...so basically Gaius 2.0.Plot holes.  I felt like there were a lot of plot holes if you were to look at the series as a whole. Off the top of my head, I still don't know what the Blood Road was meant for, yet it was such a big deal when Gaius first took over.There is probably a lot more to say but I finished this book 2 weeks ago, so I barely remember much. If I ever re-read it, I will probably catch a lot more and update this review. -----------------------I have to wait a YEAR  before I get to read more Magnus and Cleo?"}, {"userName": "April", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37089590-april", "userReview": "Nothing better not happen to Magnus.\ud83d\ude20"}, {"userName": "Cody", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35007929-cody", "userReview": "CRYSTAL STORM....
