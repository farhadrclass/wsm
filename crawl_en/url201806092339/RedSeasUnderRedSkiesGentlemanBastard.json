It was a long time back, and I can barely bring to mind what I ate for lunch yesterday. So I'm not terribly reliable that way. I also vaguely remember that it wasn't as talked-up as Lies of Locke Lamora. There wasn't the same excited buzz about it when it came out, so I remember feeling reasonably justified in my \"meh\" feeling. That means reading through it again a second time was an interesting experience. Because now I have passed through the fiery hell that is Publishing The Second Book. Don't get me wrong: first books are hard, especially in secondary-world fantasy. You have to introduce an entire world. You're constantly walking the knife-edge between boring people by explaining too much, and confusing them by explaining too little. But on the plus side, in a first book (or movie for that matter) everything has the benefit of being shiny and new. Every revelation is fresh and exciting. Every character is a mystery unfurling. That's not the case in a second book. In a second book, you still have that problem. PLUS you have the problem that some of your readers read the first book two days ago, and some of them read it two years ago. Some of them haven't read it at *all.*On top of that, a lot of people want nothing more than for you to write your first book over again\u2026 because that's what they know and love. But you *can't* do that, because you only get one beginning. When you write the second book in a series, the honeymoon is over. Now you're in a whole different type of relationship. And love is harder to maintain than infatuation. That's why, in my opinion, shifting gears from first book to second book is THE most difficult part of being a new writer. Given all of this, I can see why people in general and me in specific might have been a little \"meh\" on this book. We were all butterflies-in-tummy tingly after reading Lies of Locke Lamora. We loved it, and we wanted to see the same thing again. Which I now realize is silly. I don't think I knew that then. I mention all of this because this second time through, I found myself wondering what my problem was the first time. Because honestly, the book is good. We get to explore a cool new piece of the world. There are characters that I know and love, being very true to themselves while still growing and changing and coming into conflict with each other and the world. There is wonderful craft here. And brilliant dialogue, as before. Wit and humor both. It's true, that this book might be a little less Ocean's Eleven and a little more Grifters. But that's okay. Because sequels *need* to change and grow a bit, otherwise a series stagnates and dies. And this book made me cry a bit, which the first one didn't. So that's a mark in its favor. So\u2026yeah. Simply said, I really enjoyed it. Did I enjoy it as much as Lies? No. But not every book can be on your top-ten list. Did Seas suffer from a bit of a sophomore slump? Yeah. A bit. But you won't find me bitching, because the only thing I could say was something along the lines of, \"O! Woe is me! I was expecting pure untrammeled brilliance and all I got was mere shining excellence! Also, they didn't have any loganberry cream cheese at the caf\u00e9 this morning, so I had to have blueberry instead! Alas! I shall now weep and write poetry in my journal!\" Yeah. I don't want to be that person. Nobody wants to be that person.That said, the ending leaves you hanging. So I'm *really* fucking glad the next book is out. Speaking of which, I think I'm going to wander over to the bookstore and buy a copy of that right now..."}, {"userName": "Ridley", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2543252-ridley", "userReview": "After reading a Tumblr post Where Lynch responded to a reader's complaints about \"political correctness\" in this novel, I am intrigued.Why shouldn\u2019t middle-aged mothers get a wish-fulfillment character, you sad little bigot?

It retained some elements that made the first book rose to its fame and at the same time, replace some of them with some new factors to the series. I do, however, enjoyed reading the first book more.\n\n\u201cDifficult\" and \"impossible\" are cousins often mistaken for one another, with very little in common.\u201d \n\nTwo years after the end of the first book, we continue straight off with The Gentleman Bastard trying to, again, pull off another biggest heist they ever attempted. The plot started with Locke & Jean camouflaging as professional gamblers in an opulent casino named Sinspire executing one of the necessary steps for their heist. However, again, the heist gets so much more complicated than what they planned.The whole setting of the book took place in a completely different place than its predecessor, this time taking place in the island city of Tal Verrar and the Sea of Brass. Although I miss the city of Camorr for its beauty and resemblance with Venice, I do think that Tal Verrar and Sea of Brass gave the necessary new atmosphere to the book and series as a whole.Picture: Tal VerrarThe entire narrative is still told in the same storytelling method as the previous book, by shifting between present and past time frame. The past sections this time are called \u201cReminiscent\u201d and it\u2019s there to bridge the 2 years gap before the beginning of the book. These \u201cpast\u201d sections are there only for the first half of the book, it\u2019s different from the previous book where it lasted from the beginning up to the end and honestly speaking, I prefer it to last all the way since it worked so well before. However, the entire \u201cReminiscent\u201d sections explored how Locke deals with the aftermath of Camorr and how he\u2019ll set up their plan for the biggest heist of their career, which remained captivating as always.The most enthralling part of the book for me will have to be the questions \u201cHow the hell will they get out of this situation?\u201d & \u201cHow will they execute their schemes?\u201d that were present through the entire plot line. It\u2019s ingenious how Scott Lynch implemented the lies, heist, all the moving parts and schemes after schemes filled with humorous, crude yet eloquent dialogues which I can\u2019t ever seem to get enough of.\n\n\u201cAny man can fart in a closed room and say that he commands the wind\u201d\n\nImagine what Kvothe the Arcane would say to that? Locke would probably fart and said he knows The Name of the Wind if they ever met.All the parts I discussed just now are more or less the same as the greatness we received in The Lies of Locke Lamora and so come up the question: \u201cwhat makes this book so different from its predecessor?\u201d Pirates, the last half of the book took on a completely different atmosphere with its seafaring, piracy, and naval warfare. Don\u2019t get me wrong, despite being on a ship most of the time, there are still a lot of lies and schemes going on and I admit, I\u2019m not too fond of being in the sea too long since there\u2019s nothing to look at in the world-building during this duration other than, you know, the sea. However, Scott Lynch managed to make it so fun to read with the never-ending problems that arise the longer the Gentleman Bastards are there. Plus, the amount and quality of the actions piece in this book are superior to the previous book in my opinion. Thrilling actions during the naval warfare and great climax scenes are all there and they, in my opinion, killed the boredom that should\u2019ve been caused by the setting completely.Picture: Locke Lamora in Red Seas Under Red Skies (Chinese edition cover)Now, let\u2019s talk about the best part of the book, the characters. With the second book finished, let\u2019s just say Locke and Jean has become one of my favorite book duo/bromance of all time. Their friendship, loyalty, banter is without a doubt the best part of the book or maybe the series itself for me, even more than the schemes and heists. Their banter and interaction completely give life to the book.Whether it\u2019s the humorous interactions,\n\n\u201cWorst of all, the inner vault is guarded by a live dragon, attended by fifty naked women armed with poisoned spears, each of them sworn to die in Requin's service. All redheads.\" \"You're just making that up, Jean.\u201d\n\nOr the heartwarming one.\n\n\u201cI want to hug you. And I want to tear your gods-damned head off. Both at once.\"\"Ah, near as I can tell, that\u2019s the definition of 'family' right there.\u201d\n\nThe Gentleman Bastards aside, all the other characters are replaced with a completely new cast of characters. This doesn\u2019t mean that the new characters are poorly written though, Zamira Drakasha and Ezri Delmastro are both a fantastic addition to the story with them being the strong and compelling female characters which the first book don\u2019t really have.Slightly third person omniscient, the writing is the same as before and honestly speaking, an omniscient narrative is actually my least preferences of narrative but ever since the first book, Scott Lynch managed to do it without losing any of the characters personality through the abundance fantastic dialogues. Sadly, this brought me up to the same minor problem I had with the first book. By doing this kind of narrative, the world-building sections are can get really info-dumpy at times. This is especially true during the first half of the book where the explanation lasted much more than necessary and it\u2019s really hard for me to pay attention during these parts. Luckily, again, it doesn\u2019t diminish my overall experience too much but it\u2019s still a minor problem I have with the series and why I didn\u2019t rate it a full 5 stars.Overall, Red Seas Under Red Skies once again proved Scott Lynch\u2019s capability in writing a great book with unique high fantasy story, compelling main characters and beautiful settings. It\u2019s another must-have addition to the Gentleman Bastard Sequence series and in my opinion, equally great with the first book. I know it\u2019s been almost 10 years since the release of this book but hey, better late than never right? So chop-chop for those of you who haven\u2019t started yet, time to read this series!I highly recommend this to anyone who\u2019s looking for a unique high fantasy full of swashbuckling, friendship, hilarious and captivating dialogues, heart-wrenching and thrilling moments yet at the same time remaining highly fun and enjoyable to read.You can find this and the rest of my Adult Epic/High Fantasy & Sci-Fi reviews at Booknest"}, {"userName": "\u263dLuna\u263e", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53385361-luna", "userReview": "5/5\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s the biggest, meanest motherfucker here? Who\u2019s the best bruiser in the Brass Coves?\u201d\n\n Buddy read with my fellow ship mates Petrik & Celeste.THIS BOOK WAS SO GOOD! Seriously, it was incredible. I can't even explain how happy I was to be back in this world. I went into this book with lowish expectations because, I heard it was the weakest in the trilogy. However for me that wasn't the case, this book was as good as The Lies of Locke Lamorr, honestly I can't decide if I like this one or the first one better, so I'm going to say they are both equally amazing. I found the writing this time around to be much easier to follow and still love the way the chapters are set, past and present. BUT I still hated the long arse descriptions that go on and on, the world building is wonderful however I found the descriptions to be over kill. The action in this one doesn't stop, its like a horrible roller coaster that your not allowed to get off, instead of vomiting, I came close to having a heart attack..On more then one occasion, I found myself talking to the book, begging for my favourite bromance ever to stay safe & friends, I even cried. Like there was some really heartbreaking parts in this book. The pain Locke & Jean felt at the start, the strain on their friendship & most importantly the death of my ultimate ship. The pain in my heart, was also real.I must also admit, it definitely wasn't as fun to read as the first. This book is a lot darker then the first and has a lot of heartbreak and anguish. It was less humorous then the first but definitely wasn't lacking for banter and still had some really funny moments. It also had a ROMANCE, Yay. I totally love romance in stories, only when the romance isn't the main focus. It had me feeling all gooey inside. I just loved everything about this book.\n\n\u201cPretend I\u2019m a barrel, then.\u201d\u201cBarrels don\u2019t have br\u2014\u201d\u201cSo I\u2019ve heard. Find the nerve, ___.\u201d\u201cYou want me to pretend that you\u2019re a barrel so I can tell you what I was telling barrels back when I was pretending they were you.\u201d\u201cPrecisely.\u201d\n\nOnly one word to describe this book and that's BADASS. As you all know I love criminals, deceit, backstabbing, bromance, swearing (my inner hillbilly loves all the swearing), thievery & tough people. Well folks this book has all of the above, like could this series actually be the bible of badassery? Truth be honest, it is the holy grail of badassery & I'm currently making a temple to worship the thirteenth god, the Crooked Warden. I swear this book was written for me. We were made for each other. It was even educational. I learnt a lot from this book, it taught me how to lie, steal, cheat, the fact that you must take cats to sea for luck, to kill people & also this new insult \n\u201cI\u2019ll fuckin\u2019 kill you later, you cabbage-brained pig-rapist!\u201d\nThe story is a continuation of book one after Locke & Jean escape from Camorr. This time around we have two broken men, who are trying to get established in the underworld in a new city. The job itself is to steal something precious from the Spinspire casino. I found the plot in this book more complex then book one, there was a quote in the book that describes it perfectly; \n\u201cThis web of lies was growing so convoluted, so branching, and so delicate that a moth\u2019s fart might knock it to pieces\u2014\u201d\nThe lies that Locke & Jean weave are so complex, I have no idea how Scott thought of half the stuff that happens in the book, some of the situations the bastards got out of or should I say lied themselves out of were so insane. This book was full of heisty goodness, it was like Oceans Eleven only with PIRATES! Did I just say pirates? Yes I fucking did. I don't know about you, but Pirates are my favourite criminals ever, so I was an extremely happy camper while reading this book. I found the pirate terminology easy to follow because well let's face it, I'm a pirate and fluent in pirate language. I also didn't know pirates loved cats?! I AM THE CRAZY CAT LADY so I loved all the mewing and pawing around. So much cat talk. I'm in cat heaven. \u201c\n\"We must have cats. A basket of cats, for the Red Messenger. We need what luck we can steal. All gods as your witness, you must not fail to have cats at that ship before we put to sea.\u201d\nBut I'm faced with a new issue & it was worst then all the heartbreak.. I can't pick a favourite character and I always need a favourite. Im indecisive on who I like more, I love them both for different reason, Jean because his the toughest motherfucker ever, \n\u201cI\u2019m the meanest motherfucker here. I\u2019m the biggest bruiser in the Brass Coves.\u201d\n. But then I also love Locke because his a clever, little crafty bastard & the best thief ever \n\"You snake-souled, dirty-minded son of a bitch! I hope a shark tries to suck your cock!\u201d\n. So I've decided they can both join my harem. I truly adore Locke & Jean, they're bromance is amazing, honestly the best bromance ever & their banter is something else, the sass is so strong with these two perfect thieves. If I could have two book best friends id choose Locke & Jean, hands down.fanart by Tolmancotton.Can this series be made into a movie now? Please. My action loving self is craving to see my bastards kick arse on screen.\n\n\u201cSurely you boys can do simple sums,\u201d he said. \u201cOne plus one equals don\u2019t fuck with me.\u201d\n\nI'd recommend this to all fantasy lovers 15+. I also think this series would be a great introduction for someone wanting to read adult fantasy. Ps. Currently training to be a gentleman bastard. See all you suckers when I'm snatching your purse.Here's some cat quotes from the book that gave me the giggles;\n\"but you\u2019d better pray in your cabin tonight for one thing.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cCats falling from the bloody sky. -OF COURSE, no convenient rain of screeching felines was forthcoming that night,\u201d\n I wish this every night aswell\n\"But\u2026can you imagine those poor bastards grappling their prey, leaping over the rails, swords in hand, screaming, \u2018Your cats!

It starts as fast paced as the previous book ended with Locke & Jean already knee deep in a con involving this worlds equivalent of a Casino known as the Sinspire. The start of the novel flips between this section and also what the characters have been up to since they sailed away from Camorr at the end of book 1. This section showcases a cool transition period which shows the Gentleman Bastard's as less than their elegant best including an alcoholic Locke!!After the first 200 pages or so - things get very complicated. Locke and Jean playing 3-4 personas depending on who they are talking too. This tale is mixed with poison, trying to rob a vault at the casino, pretending to be pirates, love, and quite a few deaths again.There are a lot more characters in this book than the first that I cared about. So much going on including the divisions of pirates, mages still after Locke & Jean, assassination attempts etc... As I mentioned this is very fast paced and I think the human qualities of the main characters shine - they are not superheroes and are just likely to make mistakes during the long cons. Also - Jean and Locke have the best bromance ever! Can't wait for the next book. James xPs. I am pretty sure I got lucky and bought the first edition of this book for \u00a31.00 from a charity shop!

Indeed, without Jean at his back Locke Lamora would have no chance of success. Both men provide the other with what he lacks, and together they make a deadly, silver tongued, thieving duo that are best summed up in two words: awesome bastards.  A deadly scheme on the high seas!It was a big surprise to me that in the prologue Jean betrays Locke. It\u2019s obviously not real, and there\u2019s obviously a reason for the farce; it is, no doubt, a charade for the benefit of their mark. But, either way, it made me storm through the book to discover exactly why it had happened. This was a bit of an underhanded move to those that the trick was played on. It worked quite well and gave me a strong reason to read this book even if I felt a little duped. The plot of this book is fast and exciting. I\u2019m not quite sure how the duo manages to pull it all off. I mean they juggle a casino heist at the same time as being manipulated by a devious Archon; then to top it off they even find time in the middle for a pirate adventure. It\u2019s quite remarkable really because just when you think their luck has run out they seem to conjure up an incredibly clever, and improvised, plan to save their hides. These two are literally two of the most scheming, ingenious, bastards that ever existed: they are the definition of lovable rogues. They grow on me with each book.  A clever partnership They know each other so well, and only because of this do they manage to defeat the odds time and time again. They have secret hand gestures and code words so they can tell the others motives in tricky situations. Locke provides the ability to worm himself out of any trap and Jean provides the muscle along with a moral thievish code. Together they are brilliant, apart they are vulnerable. Their history together keeps them alive and allows for the most outlandish of plans to develop into a truly intricate plot. \u201cWhen you can't cheat the game, you'd best find a means to cheat the players.\u201dI do think the author\u2019s writing has improved in this novel. He still uses the same eloquent descriptions, but the superfluous and convoluted information about the scenery are kept to a minimum. In the previous book it felt he\u2019d spent paragraphs describing inanimate objects and irrelevant places; I was glad to see a more concise approach to his writing. I think he has got the balance just right in this novel and I can easily see this developing into a really strong series. I can\u2019t wait to see where the author takes this in the future.

His characters are dealing with the events of the previous novel, in a mostly believable fashion, in a believable time period- its kept from becoming episodic, or his characters from seeming hollow. I very much enjoyed the first 200 pages as they both try to move on and deal with the past- and the explanation of how they got where they are when the novel opens- two years on from the events of Lies. A+ character development, A+ banter, A+ action sequences, A+ for inventiveness, loved the relationship between Locke and Jean, and it had mostly well done plot development, as Locke and Jean embroil themselves in yet another high flying Oceans Eleven style con.However. And this is a big however- it felt like Scott Lynch suddenly changed his mind completely about what he wanted to write, and had a big Screw It moment, and decided to be completely self-indulgent. Which I'm sure was a lot of fun for him, but for the reader, it is a very confusing, ridiculous sharp disappointment. Somewhere along the way, he decided he wanted to write Pirates of the Carribean fanfiction, stealing plot details (which kind of sucked even in the movies), settings, near direct quotes, and even little moments of action in battle sequences. His other influences were starkly obvious as well- there were strong, strong nods to The Princess Bride, moments out of the movie they made of Zorro, even. His characters fell victim to the most overdone of fantasy genre stereotypes (the fact that they didn't do this was one of my favorite parts of the first book), his plot was increasingly unlikely, and also became a ridiculous soap opera, and the quality of his writing went from laugh out loud to roll my eyes so loud you can hear me across the room. I also felt that this book got incredibly preachy at points- which is kind of a killjoy for a novel that has two thieves for heroes. Lynch decided that he needed to push some kind of Robin Hood, working class agenda to make his heroes seem morally superior to everyone else. Nobody is reading this book for justice for the lower classes, Lynch.It wasn't all bad- I appreciated the Lynch inserts women into professions all throughout his world mostly without preachy comment, I liked the character of the pirate Zamira, I enjoyed that Jean (who is still mostly wonderful) got his own independent storyline, I enjoyed how good his descriptive powers can be, and like I said, I enjoyed the first 200 pages.But come on, this could have been much better."}, {"userName": "Matthew", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16254355-matthew", "userReview": "This book is 1/3 this:And 2/3 this:Quite a fantastic and epic story!

When I was six or seven, my favorite Saturday-morning cartoon was Pirates of the Dark Waters. (Which so didn\u2019t age well, but nostalgia covers a multitude of sins.) In junior high, I went through a phase where I researched every famous pirate I knew of, just because I found them fascinating. I\u2019ve loved every single one of The Pirates of the Caribbean movies, including those that some people considered flops. I had a poster of Jack Sparrow over my bed in high school, but that wasn\u2019t because I loved pirates; that was because I had the hots for Johnny Depp in eyeliner. Anyway, moving on!Fantasy is my favorite literary genre, but I\u2019ve always found it sadly lacking in pirates. Yes, I know there are a few wonderful exceptions. But all in all, pirates are scarce in fantasy. So imagine my delight when the sequel to one of my favorite fantasy novels, The Lies of Locke Lamora, featured a heavy dose of piracy! And the aspects of piracy, from the hierarchy and camaraderie between the crew to the way battle is waged on the open sea to the ships themselves, were presented in such a captivating way that I could feel the wind against my cheek and smell the salt in the air. Just based on that fact alone, this book would have made me happy. But there was so much more to love here.As in Lies, the character development is incredible. Even supporting characters who only appear in a scene or two feel like real people. Main supporting characters are even more realistic, inspiring a plethora of emotions in readers. But then there\u2019s Locke and Jean. This is the best friendship I\u2019ve read in any book, it truly is. And I don\u2019t say that lightly. There are other literary friendships that I adore, and that mean a lot to me. Sherlock and Watson, Harry and Ron and Hermione, Legolas and Gimli, Wax and Wayne, and so many more just pale in comparison to Locke and Jean; at least, they do for me. Lynch\u2019s descriptive powers are phenomenal. Just as I grew to love Camorr, dark side and all, I grew to love and hate Tal Verrar, and would envision its streets and docks and Sinspire just as well as I could Camorr\u2019s canals and temples. In both books, the cities themselves played a large part in the cons Locke and Jean planned. The cons themselves, and the way bits and pieces of them are revealed throughout the story, are always a pleasure to read. Never in my life have chairs inspired so much curiosity in me. Something else I really loved: there\u2019s not even a hint of sexism in Lynch\u2019s writing, which is refreshing in fantasy. Modern fantasy writers are getting much better at portraying female characters as women instead of props, but Lynch is one of the best I\u2019ve ever read in this regard. His women are real. And women populate every profession in the books with equality to their male counterparts. Women are guards and soldiers and pirate captains, and I love how no one ever questions a woman\u2019s ability to fight as well as any man. There is romance in this story, romance that will make your heart bleed and your teeth ache with the sweetness of it. There are triumphs and betrayals and plots within plots. More than any other fantasy I\u2019ve read, the first two Gentleman Bastards books have shocked me and inflicted severe emotional trauma. But they are also among the funniest books I\u2019ve ever read. The dialogue is second to none. Some of the funniest lines I\u2019ve read in my entire life came from the pen of Lynch. Here are just a few lines from the numerous that I highlighted in this book:\u201cAny man can fart in a closed room and say that he commands the wind.\"\u201cMaxilan, darling.\" Locke raised one eyebrow and smiled. \"I knew you were driven, but I had no idea you could smoulder. Come, take me now! Jean won't mind; he'll avert his eyes like a gentleman.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re ten pints of crazy in a one-pint glass.\u201d \u201cYou needed a bath,\" Jean interrupted. \"You were covered in self-pity.\u201d\u201cYou'd have to take your shoes and breeches off to count to twenty-one!\u201d There are many, MANY more, but I feel that I can\u2019t repeat them in polite company. (That last one I probably shouldn\u2019t have included either, but it\u2019s one of the funniest things I\u2019ve ever read and I couldn\u2019t help myself!) Which means you\u2019ll just have to pick up the book to read the best lines! If you do, I promise you\u2019ll find one of the funniest, most heart-wrenching books you\u2019ll ever read. This is a series well worth reading. I\u2019ll leave you with a quote from Jean, about what it means to be a thief:\u201cLook for us in history books and you\u2019ll find us in the margins. Look for us in legends, and you might just find us celebrated.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Ginger", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14097149-ginger", "userReview": "Welp, seldom has a book made me waver on how much I felt about it. I definitely went into this sequel with high hopes because I loved The Lies of Locke Lamora!At the beginning of the book, Red Seas Under Red Skies seemed to be heading in the same way. And then it got weighed down. I like when a book has tons of twists and plots so I stayed with the course. But there were sections that got tedious and I struggled, especially with the nautical information that Jean and Locke had to learn. Also, the details of the double crossing and all the players in the story took a bit to get into as well.But then half way in the middle of the book, the sun rose and all the tedious details gave to the real story! Argh matey, they be pirates! And it was awesome!Once Lynch had everything in place, it came together for a fun and exciting adventure on the high seas. The new characters worked so well with the Gentlemen Bastards and I fell in love with them all. Pirates, some romance, adventure, an epic battle, a tragic death, and some double crossing, this book as you can see has it all for an epic fantasy.The buildup took too long to get to in this book and the details were a bit tedious, so that\u2019s why I have to give this 4 stars instead of 5. But overall, a fantastic sequel!Oh yeah, that cliffhanger at the end?! Gah! You are fucking brilliant Lynch because I have to read the next book in the series.

Gentlemens Bastard 2 does the rare feet of improving on the original formula of the first novel!!I was so impressed and entertained after the first go round of Gentlemens Bastard, that decided to go right into the second book without pause. In the first novel, Lynch introduces us to the \u2018guild of thieves\u2019 and multiple characters including the protagonist Locke and his best bud and confidant \u2018Jean\u2019. The world building in the first book was awesome, and the city Cammor had a tinge of \u2018old Venice\u2019 interlaced with corruption, thievery contrasted by nobility of dukes and dignitaries. In the second book, Lynch takes us to a whole new ride in the large city of Tal Verrar. Locke and Jean are much more closely bonded after all the adventures and mishaps of the first novel, so it\u2019s not surprising that the schemes and plotting are abundant from the very beginning.Lynch is an amazing character-driven writer, and he does an awesome job developing Locke and Jean. New unforgettable characters are also introduced, including new villains who want to destroy Locke and Jean at any cost! (Actually they really want to destroy Locke who pisses everyone off with his witty, sarcastic way).Lynch is damn funny and writes some really hilarious shit, the likes which almost made me piss in my pants! The dialogue between characters are simply mind-boggling!!  And to no surprise, Locke wins the prize at the most memorable, funny sarcastic quotes: \u201c Shut up\u2026I want you to use your misplaced acorn of a brain before the squirrel comes looking for it again..\u201dNow, for the elephant in the room\u2026PIRATES!! Boy, there are pirates galore in this book! Trust me, these are not the cheese type of pirates you see in \u2018Pirates of the Caribbean\u2019. These are BADASS mofos, rude and crass in their behavior, not afraid of a good ASSKICKING, and the occasional looting and disorderly conduct. Lynch again creates magic, in establishing a whole new \u2018ecosystem\u2019 for the book by introducing the pirates and mixing it all up with Locke and Jean! I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention about the audiobook version of this book: THE AUDIOBOOK VERSION OF GENTLEMEN BASTARD 2 IS BRILLIANT IN EVERY SENSE!!The book is narrated by the talented \u2018Michael Page\u2019, a British professional actor well known for his audiobook works in over 200 titles! Mr Page has actually won a \u2018AudioFile Earphones Awards\u2019 for the narration of Locke Lamorra! I kid you not, his voice-over acting is mesmerizing\u2026 the way he switches between each character ( male and female) without dropping a note, is pitch perfect! The combination of Lynch\u2019s witty, fast-pace dialogue and Page\u2019s acting prowess made this audiobook a true delight to enjoy! In conclusion I endorse this book for foes and friends of all ages(ok maybe not all ages, > 18 y/o).The book is witty, has loads of R-rated humor, improves on the' bromance' between Locke and Jean and adds a whole new dimension with pirates and all baskets of fun associated with them!! Again the audiobook version is a  MUST HAVE EXPERIENCE! By far the most unique, entertaining audiobook experience I\u2019ve ever had!  5 STARS!"}, {"userName": "Natalie Monroe", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6688207-natalie-monroe", "userReview": "EDIT 22/1/2017: Saw Scott Lynch's reply to a reader who complained that a black, middle-aged badass pirate mom was \"unrealistic\" and now I love this series more than ever (Underlined parts are the criticism):Third your characters are unrealistic stereotpyes of political correctness. Is it really necessary for the sake of popular sensibilities to have in a fantasy what we have in the real world? I read fantasy to get away from politically correct cliches.God, yes! If there's one thing fantasy is just crawling with these days it's widowed black middle-aged pirate moms.Real sea pirates could not be controlled by women, they were vicous rapits and murderers and I am sorry to say it was a man's world. It is unrealistic wish fulfilment for you and your readers to have so many female pirates, especially if you want to be politically correct about it!First, I will pretend that your last sentence makes sense because it will save us all time. Second, now you're pissing me off.You know what? Yeah, Zamira Drakasha, middle-aged pirate mother of two, is a wish-fulfillment fantasy. I realized this as she was evolving on the page, and you know what? I fucking embrace it.Why shouldn't middle-aged mothers get a wish-fulfillment character, you sad little bigot? Everyone else does. H.L. Mencken once wrote that \"Every normal man must be tempted at times to spit on his hands, hoist the black flag, and begin slitting throats.\" I can't think of anyone to whom that applies more than my own mom, and the mothers on my friends list, with the incredible demands on time and spirit they face in their efforts to raise their kids, preserve their families, and save their own identity/sanity into the bargain.Shit yes, Zamira Drakasha, leaping across the gap between burning ships with twin sabers in hand to kick in some fucking heads and sail off into the sunset with her toddlers in her arms and a hold full of plundered goods, is a wish-fulfillment fantasy from hell. I offer her up on a silver platter with a fucking bow on top; I hope she amuses and delights. In my fictional world, opportunities for butt-kicking do not cease merely because one isn't a beautiful teenager or a muscle-wrapped font of testosterone. In my fictional universe, the main characters are a fat ugly guy and a skinny forgettable guy, with a supporting cast that includes \"SBF, 41, nonsmoker, 2 children, buccaneer of no fixed abode, seeks unescorted merchant for light boarding, heavy plunder.\"You don't like it? Don't buy my books. Get your own fictional universe. Your cabbage-water vision of worldbuilding bores me to tears.As for the \"man's world\" thing, religious sentiments and gender prejudices flow differently in this fictional world. Women are regarded as luckier, better sailors than men. It's regarded as folly for a ship to put to sea without at least one female officer; there are several all-female naval military traditions dating back centuries, and Drakasha comes from one of them. As for claims to \"realism,\" your complaint is of a kind with those from bigoted hand-wringers who whine that women can't possibly fly combat aircraft, command naval vessels, serve in infantry actions, work as firefighters, police officers, etc. despite the fact that they do all of those things-- and are, for a certainty, doing them all somewhere at this very minute. Tell me that a fit fortyish woman with 25+ years of experience at sea and several decades of live bladefighting practice under her belt isn't a threat when she runs across the deck toward you, and I'll tell you something in return-- you're gonna die of stab wounds.What you're really complaining about isn't the fact that my fiction violates some objective \"reality,\" but rather that it impinges upon your sad, dull little conception of how the world works. I'm not beholden to the confirmation of your prejudices; to be perfectly frank, the prospect of confining the female characters in my story to placid, helpless secondary places in the narrative is so goddamn boring that I would rather not write at all. I'm not writing history, I'm writing speculative fiction. Nobody's going to force you to buy it. Conversely, you're cracked if you think you can persuade me not to write about what amuses and excites me in deference to your vision, because your vision fucking sucks.I do not expect to change your mind but i hope that you will at least consider that I and others will not be buying your work because of these issues. I have been reading science fiction and fantasy for years and i know that I speak for a great many people. I hope you might stop to think about the sales you will lose because you want to bring your political corectness and foul language into fantasy. if we wanted those things we could go to the movies. Think about this!Thank you for your sentiments. I offer you in exchange this engraved invitation to go piss up a hill, suitable for framing.Original review:\n\"You are thieves.

I'm bold enough to give this a 3, because that's the highest it can go. The novel is not bad, but it's also not phenomenal. Am I the only one reminded of Pirates of the Caribbean while reading this? Pirates aside, it had the same vibe to it. I really liked Pirates, but just like Red Seas, both had a lot of dull moments.Red Seas would've received at least a 4 from me, if it was consistent with its amazing first few chapters. This keeps happening with Lynch, he can't seem to be consistent with his page turning chapters. I experienced the same thing with Lies, I was completely hooked, but then the middle part was just terribly boring. Nothing changed with Red Seas, unfortunately. The plot was not completely boring, but also not as interesting as I wanted it to be. The ending was phenomenal, but majority of the novel was really dragging.This is not one of those Fantasy novels with a secret that you would only find out after reading the novel. This is one of those adventure types that would reveal the outcome of the mission in the end. I like those kinds of novels, but this one wasn't that gripping. I'm not entirely sure what went wrong, but the plot could've been better. I'm really hoping the next novel wouldn't be that boring. I didn't hate this book, in fact, I'm planning to read the sequel right away. This one just didn't have that something that would keep me at my seat and fascinate me. I didn't hate the novel while reading this, but boredom was really evident. Despite the boredom, I think I can still recommend this to fantasy readers. It's quite different to the mainstream ones, plot wise. The characters are also really great. Locke and Jean are a dynamic duo that makes you want to know what would happen to them. The plot may had been boring, but the characters were unbelievably spot on.To wrap things up, this is not the best fantasy novel out there, but it's still worth giving a try. This probably suffered the second book syndrome, but I guess it's not all because of that considering I had the same problems with the first novel. May the third be better, because I really like the characters a lot. Not so gripping yet still something to consider reading. Read at your own risk though, because this is not a short read.

Lies of Locke Lamora was mainly a whole lot of fun, but the terrible deaths that occurred were genuinely upsetting, and I appreciated how Lynch didn't just rush past the trauma that Jean and especially Locke experience after losing so much. I appreciated Lynch's compassion and sincerity, doled out in advance of and in between all of the fun and excitement.Red Seas is a worthy follow-up book in many ways. the odd science fantasy of this series still intrigues, the adventures are still rousing, the mysteries are still compelling, and the dialogue still snaps, crackles, and pops. Lynch is a brash but also warmly humane writer who loves his characters deeply but doesn't love them in a way that overlooks their flaws. he's not blinded by the sparkle of his creations. somehow Lynch is one of those authors whose writing makes me like him as a person, as a human being. I have no clue about who the man is, but I still just really appreciate him. that said, there is a deep flaw in Red Seas: its structure. the novel starts off as a retread of the previous novel by placing the reader right in the middle of one of Locke's new schemes and the subsequent complications (namely, another complex and amusing heist that gets taken over by darker schemes from darker characters). from the title, I expected a pirate adventure and was a wee bit disappointed. still, Lynch creates an entirely new society and although I was taken aback at how instantly familiar the scenario itself was, I was enchanted by this new country. he's an expert world builder. but halfway through the novel, that storyline is shunted to the side and then Pirate Adventures finally ensue. and then in the last few chapters, it is back to the original plotline. everything is enjoyably resolved, but those last chapters felt sadly rushed. and at that point I wanted more Pirate Adventure! which is clearly what Lynch himself wanted to write about. the central section is the heart and soul of the novel. I loved it completely. I just thought it was remarkably clumsy how we got to there and how we left as well - it starts off as a side trip and then becomes the actual adventure. it took me a bit of time to get into it because although it is exactly what I wanted to read when I first picked up the book, I immediately felt impatience when I realized the story of heists and double crosses was being temporarily abandoned. all in all, what Red Seas Under Red Skies lacks the most is flow. its narrative was herky-jerky.I hate that my longest paragraph in this review is basically a bitch session. well, I guess that explains the 3 rather than 4 stars. but overall I quite liked this and would certainly recommend it. I wish I could make this paragraph longer!the MVP of the tale is the pirate Captain Drakasha, who also happens to be no-nonsense ex-military, someone possessed of a surprising sense of humor, and... a single black mother of two. because why? because why not! I'm mixed-race and although I don't seek out books for racial diversity in their characters, it always makes me happy to see more people who look like me in the books I read, and I'm always delighted when it happens in a way that doesn't feel like tokenism. Drakasha was an amazingly unexpected creation to find in a story about fantastical pirate adventures on the high seas. she is fun and original and, best of all, deeply characterized. just a real pleasure to be around. I wanted much more of her and that's a great feeling to have about any character.at the end of the book, after all of the adventure and even more tragedy, friends sit down to have a drink, try to forget about the year they just had, and temporarily put on hold the foreboding they have for what may lie ahead. and I'm going to do the same in matter of minutes. cheers!

The first half felt slow, filled with long descriptions that more or less proved irrelevant. At the midpoint, my attention was finally captured, and the book remained worthy of three stars for the third quarter of the novel. However, by the fourth quarter of the book, the ever-shifting use of names (one alias atop another, or using a character's first name then inexplicably shifting to use of a character's last name) muddled the story.

The three major reasons I enjoyed the first book were World Building, Character Work, and Story. And honestly I can just chalk up these three areas to why the sequel succeeds as well.The story opens in a new city with a new con that Locke and Jean are trying to pull off because that is what they do and what they are good at. Lynch does a wonderful job creating a new and equally interesting city for them exploit. Much like the first book we get flashbacks that fill out the details of the years that have passed since the first book concluded. Naturally their plan does not go as expected, shenanigans ensue, and they must rely on their wits and each other to get out of a mess with their hides intact. You know, standard fantasy heist story stuff. But it is the new characters we encounter along the way that makes this typical plot arc engaging, from the Military ruler of Tal Verrar, to the owner of a very high end Gambling tower, to freedom loving pirates the story is littered with fascinating and well developed characters for Locke and Jean to play off of.My only nitpick is that there is a chunk of text in the middle of the book where Locke and Jean (and the reader) learn about operating a ship and it just drags on for much too long and probably wasn't terribly essential to the story. But other than that this book was right on par with the first, a fun adventure and heist romp with two lovable rogues."}, {"userName": "K\u00fcbra Ya\u011fmur", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36997724-k-bra-ya-mur", "userReview": "[\u0130kinci kitaba ba\u015flay\u0131p k\u0131vranma b\u00f6l\u00fcmlerinin bu kadar a\u011f\u0131r ilerlemesinden dolay\u0131 gittim \u00fc\u00e7\u00fcnc\u00fc kitab\u0131n blurb\u00fcne, kapa\u011f\u0131na falan bakt\u0131m.

Locke Lamora is still at the heart of the narrative, and I don't think he could get from bed to breakfast without hatching or implementing a Rube Goldberg of a plot. It remains a sort of \"Oceans Eleven\" caper at the beginning, with multiple steps and a long, convoluted plan of attack on the owner of an elaborate and elite gambling facility. However, in true Oceans fashion, even as the con is planned and developed, Lynch keeps surprise elements in reserve. Locke is more than just a bit of a rogue, and has few principles to guide him. I haven't been in the mood to read rogue, but this has been sitting on my shelf for two months and needed to be read. I stuck with it and am pleased to see Locke's ethical compass developing. What Locke still hasn't comprehended is that the cost of revenge is very, very dear, and might cost everything. We see him early on wallowing in self pity, then acting and saying things to Jean about their old life, apologizing for mistakes made and missing their friends. And yet they are right back in it with their con, and the worst part is, Locke still hasn't realized that his opponents have even fewer scruples than he. There's some tender touches midway through for Jean, which is a redeeming moment of happiness in a generally grim book. I also like the fact that Locke has to \"come clean\" and enlist the help of others if he is to survive. As always, I appreciate and enjoy the close friendship between Locke and Jean, finding it both believable and redemptive.Lynch also does a fabulous job envisioning his world and all it's different political structures and terrains. As usual for me, it usually reminds me of the city-states of Renaissance/pre-Ren Italy. The language he uses is fun and complex, with just the right amount of detail, although for those that objected to swearing in the first, it's still here--especially when Locke and Jean head to sea. There are few fantastical elements--the most fantastical thing is probably the mysterious sea creatures and a passage through a haunted channel. For it's genre, I'd almost call it steampunk style, with a heavy reliance on alchemy and \"artificers.\" Again, reminds me of Leonardo di Vinci's Italy. Narrative continues the back-and forth between events shortly after the end of the last book and a fast forward two years in the future. It works fairly well at the beginning and helps make the transformation back to the normal Locke tolerable. I do give Lynch lots of credit for the very likeable and noble female pirate character Zamira.A great book, if you feel like devious plotting, rogue heroes and a smattering of casual violence and swearing. And lady pirates."}, {"userName": "G\u00f6k\u00e7e", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37696980-g-k-e", "userReview": "san\u0131r\u0131m \u00f6l\u00fcyorum. bye.edit: d\u00f6rd\u00fcnc\u00fc kitap \u00e7\u0131kana kadar \u00fc\u00e7\u00fcnc\u00fcy\u00fc okumayaca\u011f\u0131ma yemin etmi\u015ftim ama dayanam\u0131yorum :)"}, {"userName": "Alienor \u2718 French Frowner \u2718", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31461418-alienor-french-frowner", "userReview": "Because I want to meet Zamira Drakasha.Oh, and because of this : As for claims to \u201crealism,\u201d your complaint is of a kind with those from bigoted hand-wringers who whine that women can\u2019t possibly fly combat aircraft, command naval vessels, serve in infantry actions, work as firefighters, police officers, etc. despite the fact that they do all of those things\u2014 and are, for a certainty, doing them all somewhere at this very minute.

I tend to do that with second volumes in most series I read for some reason. (I am only sharing this mind numbingly uninteresting fact with you because I have no idea what to write for the opening paragraph of this review!)Red Seas Under Red Skies is a worthy follow up to  The Lies of Locke Lamora which made Scott Lynch one of the elite fantasy authors working today. The story feels more like a \u201cfurther adventure of Locke and Jean\u201d than a direct continuation, making each of these two books almost standalones though I do not recommend reading them out of order, and there really is no need to as the first book is a great read.As with the previous book Lynch likes to use the literary device of scrambling the timeline with flashbacks and flashforwards, probably to create tension or anticipation and \u2013 of course \u2013 to tease. I personally prefer a straight timeline but novels are works of art and authors generally know best how they should be presented. In any case Lynch is too skillful to make a mess of the narrative, there is never any confusion in reading the book. I think the main appeal of Lynch\u2019s writing is the vivid and lively characters he is able to create, be they heroes or villains. With Red Seas Under Red Skies he has outdone his accomplishment in the previous book. Locke Lamora is still the same lovable rogue we are already familiar with but his partner/BFF Jean Tannen is very well fleshed out in this book in spite of not having the story told from his point of view, we only see him through Locke\u2019s eyes in this book. I tend to find that the secondary character in fantasy novels are more interesting and likeable than the protagonist, in the way that Ron Weasley is more interesting than Harry Potter or Samwise Gamgee is much more likeable and capable than Frodo. The same applies for this Gentleman Bastard series (so far) but the dynamic between Locke and Jean works very well where Locke is the brains of the operation and Jean is usually the brawn, not that Jean is unintelligent or even uneducated, he is just more honest and less devious. While I enjoyed the witty repartees of  The Lies of Locke Lamora I did find it a little overdone in that every single character major and minor seem to always be ready with the quips, even incidental characters who only appear in the book for a few paragraphs. The dialog of Red Seas Under Red Skies is better, more balanced and more believable. Characters seem to have more distinctive voices this time around.As the title suggests Red Seas Under Red Skies is mostly a nautical adventure as complicated circumstances lead our heroes find themselves joining a pirate ship. In this book we meet wonderful lady pirate captain Zamira Drakasha* and her equally badass Lieutenant Ezri Delmastro. Tough, fighting women in fiction seem to be based on Ellen Ripley (from Alien) most of the time but these two ladies show more feminine and even maternal sides in certain situations making them more believable and likeable. The pacing of the book is a little slow to begin with while Lynch is setting up his pieces through pages of dialogues. Once we get to the high seas adventure part the narrative shifts to higher gear and become something of a romp. The book is densely plotted and our heroes and their allies seldom have a moment to unwind as the odds are stacked against them. The language is deliberately flowery at times as it is Locke\u2019s stock in trade as a con artist. There is even a little romance and some lump-in-the-throat poignant moments. Magic is not much in evidence in this book and weird monstrosities are only glimpsed from time to time, though there is quite a lot of alchemy and numerous steampunk-ish clockwork devices. I much prefer this kind of \u201clow fantasy\u201d to the traditional ones with wizards conjuring entire houses or turning people into newts, my suspension of disbelief can only stretch so far. If you like  The Lies of Locke Lamora as most people seem to do you probably don\u2019t need me to recommend this book to you. I already have the next volume  The Republic of Thieves so I doubt I will wait almost a year before getting to it.________________________________________* A reader has foolishly taken Scott Lynch to task about this female pirate character, his reply is epic!"}], "description": "After a brutal battle with the underworld that nearly destroyed him, Locke and his trusted sidekick, Jean, \ufb02ed the island city of their birth and landed on the exotic shores of Tal Verrar to nurse their wounds.
