To be honest, I was expecting The Bond to be something along the lines of the book Why Animals Matter--an \u201cAnimal Protection 101\u201d primer on the issues that wouldn\u2019t be as useful to seasoned advocates. I\u2019m pleased to report that my first impression was wrong, and longtime animal advocates will find as much valuable material in The Bond as newcomers to the issues. Pacelle begins with an overview of the history of the human-animal bond, a connection that stretches back to the dawn of humanity. And while early humans relied on animals for food, clothing, and other necessities, the practice of pet-keeping dates back nearly as far. Pacelle writes:Critics of today\u2019s animal-protection movement often argue that animal welfare is ultimately a trivial matter\u2014the product of effete modern sensibilities. But the truth is that our relationship with animals has always been profoundly important. And while organized activism for animals may be somewhat newer, it too has a long pedigree that didn\u2019t begin with a PETA member in a bunny suit: [Henry] Bergh  and [George] Angell , in particular, focused on all cruelties, from inhumane transportation and slaughter of livestock, to pigeon shoots, animal fighting, and vivisection. Congress\u2019s first animal protection law, enacted in 1873, actually protected farm animals.And Pacelle gives us historical insight on how we got into the current mess we\u2019re in regards to animal welfare: In the United Kingdom, Parliament regulated vivisection in 1876, but despite parallel efforts by American advocates, the US Congress did not follow, and animal experimentation went largely unregulated until Congress enacted the federal Animal Welfare Act nearly a century later. The result of these long-ago failures by Congress was to leave a free-for-all in animal experimentation and agriculture...So many of the animal-welfare controversies of our day could have been avoided had there only been some basic moral framework for the conduct of these industries, put in place before new and ever more severe cruelties were allowed to become the norm.Pacelle\u2019s working relationship with infamous former dogfighter Michael Vick has sparked confusion and controversy among HSUS supporters, as well as cynical, manufactured outrage from anti-animal propaganda groups. Pacelle\u2019s well thought-out chapter on this subject will give readers insight into this choice, even if they ultimately disagree with it. At one point in their prison visiting-room discussion, Vick inconceivably states he loved his fighting dogs. Pacelle responds:\u201cMike, I think that\u2019s admiration, in some narrow sense. But that\u2019s not love. You don\u2019t hurt somebody or some animal you love. You may be drawn to animals and you may have an interest in them. But love\u2019s more than admiration and fascination. It\u2019s about care and affection.\u201dThankfully, Pacelle has the guts to take his reasoning beyond Vick\u2019s seemingly bizarre statement. It\u2019s a common thing for dog fighters and cockfighters to profess themselves animal lovers and talk of their admiration for their animals\u2019 strength and courage in the pit. And guess what? Sport hunters, too, share this same mindset. Hunters decorate their homes and vehicles with images of whitetail bucks, turkeys, and ducks. They speak of their sincere love for the animals they pierce with bullets and arrows. The way of thinking among animal fighters reminded me of the same mindset I\u2019ve come across elsewhere. ...[Vick] was one of many people who abused animals while telling themselves they loved them. Animal fighting has long been a focal point of the HSUS, and we need to be reminded just how much work it took for this cruelty to become part of the national agenda. In comparing the situation between today and the year 1975:Dogfighting was banned in all fifty states back in 1975...but it was not a felony anywhere. There were no felony cockfighting laws, either, and cockfighting was legal in more than a half-dozen states. Very few humane organizations focused on animal fighting, and law enforcement generally did not consider this misdemeanor offense worthy of their attention.We learn that the cockfighting subset has far more lobbying power than one might imagine. As with any animal industry, even illegal ones, there\u2019s quite a bit of money behind it. Cockfighters have their own magazines and mail order services where they can buy things such as a stimulant called \u201cPure Aggression\u201d for fighting roosters.Puppy mills are another major issue for HSUS. We learn that one of the major blockers of puppy mill reform (and this will be a surprise for some) is the American Kennel Club, the organization that bills itself as \u201cthe dog\u2019s champion.\u201d Once you close this book, you\u2019ll realize what a farce that motto truly is. Pacelle profiles an esteemed dog breeder and show judge, Ted Paul, who came out publicly in support of an Oregon bill to reform puppy mills, the often hideously neglectful large scale commercial breeding facilities. After [Paul] testified, citing his nearly fifty years in the world of purebred dogs, he was deemed a \u201ctraitor,\u201d with many fellow breeders calling for his \u201csuspension\u201d from the show judge world...The bill was enacted, and Ted\u2019s offense was that he was, as a dog breeder, actively supporting HSUS-backed legislation to crack down on puppy mills. Since the hearing he\u2019s basically been blackballed as a judge, and members of the dog fancy promised they would not show their dogs if Ted was in the chair.And what honorable practices was this evil bill curtailing? The measure stipulated that dogs used for commercial breeding purposes not be kept in cages to small for them, that the cages not be stacked, and that they have solid flooring rather than wire. The dogs had to be let out for exercise for one hour a day, and they had to be out of the cage when their waste was cleaned, which also had to happen once a day.(The horror!) One of the AKC\u2019s favorite arguments is that puppy mills are \u201cUSDA inspected,\u201d so they don\u2019t need any further legal reforms. There\u2019s just one problem: Under the federal Animal Welfare Act, the USDA is supposed to conduct inspections of large, licensed commercial breeders. It turns out that more than half of the ten thousand mills are not required to get a license and thus are not inspected by USDA at all. A loophole in the regulations exempts breeders if they sell dogs directly to consumers right from the farm or through a website, rather than selling them through a pet store, and thousands of operators have been quick to exploit this loophole.Pacelle concludes: If you think the NRA has mastered the \u201cslippery slope\u201d argument, you ought to hear the executives and lobbyists at the AKC. So much for the \u201cdog\u2019s champion.\u201dSpeaking of the NRA, Pacelle devotes another chapter to the practices of sport and trophy hunting. He clarifies the policies of his organization: At HSUS, we have not campaigned against all forms of sport hunting in Alaska or any other part of the country. Despite the overblown claims of the NRA and other prohunting organizations that we are working to ban it all, we\u2019ve largely asked hunters to hold themselves, at the very least, to their own professed standards of conduct....These are standards that no politically influential hunting organization advocates today\u2014indeed, none of these groups asks its members to abide by any serious ethical code of conduct. On the contrary, the politically active hunting groups are the ones who promote the worst practices and resist any restraints at all. So, while Pacelle himself may personally oppose sport hunting, the HSUS does not work against all hunting, but rather the most egregious practices such as canned hunting. (This actually may be a disappointment for some AR advocates.) Yet trying to reform even canned hunting (hunters use the more benign term \u201chigh-fence hunting\u201d) is tough enough:Operators provide a price list of native and exotic species, and hunters shoot the animals in a \u201cno kill, no pay\u201d arrangement, with the outcome certain. Somehow this doesn\u2019t offend the hunting lobby\u2019s \u201csportsmanship\u201d sensibilities. The Safari Club International even bestows \u201chunting achievement\u201d awards and \u201cGrand Slam\u201d prizes on hunters who shoot animals trapped inside fences. In fact, one such hunting award, \u201cIntroduced Trophy Game Animals of North America,\u201d is designed to send customers a-runnin\u2019 to these fenced-in hunting ranches. Not to be outdone, the NRA backed the infamous  Hegins Pigeon Shoot:  [T]he NRA treated any limitation on shooting sports or hunting as a first step toward banning them all. \u201cPigeon shooting is an historic and legitimate activity steeped in tradition with many participants throughout the Commonwealth and around the world,\u201d read an NRA alert to its members. \u201cFor over one hundred years, shoots have been held in Pennsylvania by law-abiding, ethical shooting enthusiasts, hunters, and sportsmen who would not tolerate an activity that would constitute cruelty to animals.If you have the stomach for it, read about these ethical shooting enthusiasts, hunters, and sportsmen who do not tolerate cruelty to animals: http://www.dickdestiny.com/blog/2006/...If you were to take a survey of NRA members, most would probably favor an end to pigeon shoots. The group\u2019s leaders, though, rally members by playing the antigun, antihunting card. \u201cNational \u2018animal rights\u2019 extremist groups, led by the Humane Society of the United States, have organized and funded efforts in Pennsylvania and around the country to ban this longstanding traditional shooting sport,\u201d wrote the NRA to it\u2019s members. \u201cMake no mistake, this isn\u2019t just about banning pigeon shooting, but banning all hunting species by species.\u201d(Gotta love it when the NRA calls some other group \u201cextremist.\u201d Perhaps it should rename itself the National Pot & Kettle Association.) In other adventures: [NRA] fought off an effort in Congress to crack down on the trade in bear gallbladders, which poachers sell into the traditional Chinese medicine market for thousands of dollars apiece\u2014a truly vile practice that has nothing to do with hunting. (They\u2019ve also, in various states, blocked measures related to cockfighting and puppy mills.) I will say thank you, Mr. Pacelle, for keeping your look at sport hunting and the NRA on-issue and not turning it into a gun control debate, which I\u2019ve unfortunately seen in other works of animal advocacy. The widespread popularity of firearms and shooting is growing by leaps and bounds in all segments of American society\u2014including individuals who oppose hunting--so there\u2019s no need to alienate people. If the AKC\u2019s anti-animal positions came as a surprise, some readers may be even more shocked to know that the American Veterinary Medical Association is also an opponent of animal welfare reforms. In the chapter on factory farming, we learn of the AVMA\u2019s reaction to the prestigious Pew Commission\u2019s report on industrial agriculture:  In particular, the AVMA attacked the [Pew] commission\u2019s recommendations to phase out nontherapeutic use of antibiotics on farm animals and slammed the recommendation that the intensive confinement of laying hens, breeding sows, and other animals be phased out. ... The best-known public health organizations in the country\u2014including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the American Public Health Association\u2014have urged the Congress to act before it\u2019s too late by banning non-therapeutic uses of antibiotics on farms. Only one major medical group opposes this public health reform, and that\u2019s the AVMA.Pacelle explains the method behind the madness: When there is no large, organized industry with a professional veterinary presence, as on the issue of animal fighting, the AVMA often takes the proanimal position. But if vets are in the employ of a legal and established animal-use industry, they can usually be counted on to endorse the corporate line. ...This unnatural alignment of interests helps explain the long list of positions shared by the AVMA and agribusiness, and why the veterinary association is so deeply estranged from widely accepted animal-welfare principles.Ah, it all makes sense now. In addition to familiar faces like the NRA, AKC, and AVMA, the animal use industries have also formed countless splinter groups to promote their interests. Pacelle notes that today\u2019s anti-animal PR folks are more sophisticated than in years past:But as the years passed and the momentum for reform increased, the dismissive tone gave way to a more nuanced rebuttal, and brusque denials gave way to comforting euphemisms. Realizing the general public believed animals should be treated humanely, the savvier spokesmen for industry began arguing that any business using animals had an interest in their welfare...They drew a distinction between \u201canimal welfare,\u201d which they professed to support, and \u201canimal rights.\u201d Giving their rhetoric a makeover, factory farmers suddenly became advocates of \u201cscience-based animal production,\u201d hunters suddenly did less killing and more \u201charvesting,\u201d and trappers and sealers were now the exemplars of the \u201csustainable use\u201d of wildlife. He also observes: It used to be [opponents] formed groups with unambiguous names like Putting People First, which really meant putting people first, second, and third, and relegating animals to the absolute bottom of the heap after people had their way with them. But names like that went out with the blunt, aggressive rhetoric we used to hear. Nowadays, the casual observer of animal-welfare controversies has a little more trouble figuring out just who the opponents of reform are. ... When the whole mission of you group is to trap, bait, shoot, fight, confine, or otherwise torment animals, it\u2019s hard to find a name with just the right ring. ... [W]hen your opponents\u2019 strategy is to look and sound as much like you as possible, and wrap themselves in the language of animal protection, you know you\u2019re making progress.I just wish Pacelle would have spent more time exposing the shadiness behind the Center for Consumer Freedom, which is  currently the main architect  behind attacks on the HSUS and the author himself. Although it may seem odd, I tend not to like the \u201clooking to the future\u201d final chapter of most animal advocacy books. I think they tend to be over-optimistic and unrealistic. However, Pacelle excels in this arena too. He outlines suggestions for building a humane economy within the framework we already have. Take a look at his sharp-witted rebuttal to factory farming interests: And last of all are corporate farmers in any position to complain about things changing too fast. They talk as if their own production practices are static, as if they cannot adjust to changing circumstances in the marketplace and adopt more humane practices. What they overlook is the incredible speed with which they changed to new and harsher ways of industrialized production\u2014to the \u201cnew agriculture\u201d with mass confinement and all of its other merciless innovations. The changes in that sector would have been almost unthinkable to farmers fifty years ago, but now they are the standard. If the industry can demonstrate that kind of movement in one direction is so little time, they can turn in the other direction too. Factory farming is the creation of human resourcefulness detached from conscience. What innovations in agriculture might come about by human resourcefulness guided by conscience?Animal advocates will also learn about hopeful developments they may have missed:The most hopeful sign came with a 2007 report by the US National Academy of Sciences...That report laid out a long-term proposal for shifting largely, if not entirely, to nonanimal testing methods for chemicals, drugs, and consumer products. The new approach, drawn from the deliberations of an expert committee, relies on modern advances in biology and technology and emphasizes human\u2014rather than animal\u2014biology."}, {"userName": "Edward Sullivan", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2574606-edward-sullivan", "userReview": "If you are already knowledgable about and active in the animal welfare movement, there's not much in this book that will be news to you.

I had been considering going vegetarian for several years, and this book gave me the push I needed to finally take the plunge. I also was expecting this book to mainly be about the history of human relationships with companion animals. To my surprise, there was much, much more included in the book, but I was not upset by this. I enjoyed learning more about issues I had no idea about, such as hunting in the United States, conservation efforts, and sealing in Canada. While the book was written by the President of the ASCPA, I didn't feel that the book was too slanted in their direction or overly touting their ideals and accomplishments. I thought it was interesting and informative to read about how politics plays into so many of these issues, and really how the opinions of so few can impact the lives of millions of people and animals. Although I started this book intending on learning more about how to work with troubled dogs (being that I have one!) I ended up learning a lot more, and ended up making some life changes I feel good about. I know not everyone will feel that way about this book, but I would definitely recommend it and suggest doing continuing research about issues that interest you the most."}, {"userName": "Beth ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/721785-beth", "userReview": "The author of THE BOND: OUR KINSHIP WITH ANIMALS, OUR CALL TO DEFEND THEM is Wayne Pacelle, president and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS). If you\u2019ve ever checked his articles on www.hsus.org or on his Facebook page, you already know about his passion for animal issues. His concerns on the Internet are obvious, too, in this book with its theme of human responsibility to animals.THE BOND begins with description of the bond we have had with animals through the ages. From there, Pacelle covers so much, but always there is this: because of our bond with animals, we have a responsibility to protect them.As anyone who owns a dog or cat knows, animals have feelings, they can be happy and sad. But through the years, says Pacelle, many humans have not believed that and so have justified their mistreatment of animals. So he devotes part of his book to showing us proof that animals do have feelings. And if we know they have feelings, he says, we know that animals aren\u2019t just things, and we have a responsibility to protect these defenseless creatures.That goes for all animals, Pacelle says. While many of us think of HSUS as advocates for dogs and cats, in reality, HSUS is just as concerned about other animals, such as chickens, turkeys, cows, and pigs, animals that are big business when they exist for human consumption.Through his first-hand experiences with these animals\u2019 circumstances, Pacelle describes the horrid conditions in which they live and die. The point of these stories that are so difficult to read is, we have a bond with these animals, too, and so a responsibility to know they do not live in misery. This is regardless of whether we eat eggs or meat.Of course, it\u2019s easiest for us to see and feel our bond with our pets. Although Pacelle doesn\u2019t have to convince us of that, he does describe the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, when so many people were forced to leave their pets behind when they left home for shelter. Because of their bond with these animals, some people refused to leave their homes without their pets, others went to great lengths to locate their pets afterward. Therefore, government has recognized our bond with our pets and now is acting on the necessity for disaster preparedness in the future to include these animals.Subsequent chapters cover examples of horrible pet abuse we probably were not aware of, abuse our own pets may have suffered before they came to us. The most surprising to me was Pacelle\u2019s indictment of the American Kennel Club (AKC). They seem more interested in the money they get when they grant AKC certification to puppies than in knowing how those puppies are living and whether they are healthy. So a puppy mill can sell a puppy with AKC certification, and that doesn\u2019t mean anything other than AKC knows the lineage is \u201cpure,\u201d i.e., the dogs are all of the same breed. Of course, that means there\u2019s probably been some inbreeding and, therefore, horrible genetic problems exist and are perpetuated. The unsuspecting buyer doesn\u2019t know that their puppy came from a puppy mill. Also, because AKC makes money certifying these puppies, AKC refuses to back any plan to base judging in dog shows on dogs\u2019 health and well being. My favorite chapter gave examples of statements people make to justify ignoring their bond with animals and doing nothing to help them. He gives simple arguments we can make when we are confronted with this. For example, if you don\u2019t eat meat because of the abuses to cows by big agribusiness, when someone says, \u201cIf you won\u2019t eat meat, then you shouldn\u2019t wear leather shoes.\u201d Argument: \u201cYou\u2019re making a case for doing nothing because I can\u2019t do everything.\u201dFor those who care about animals, sometimes this book is difficult to read because of all the real-life examples of abuses to animals. If this is you, just take a break between chapters. But do read it.This is such an important book! Everyone should read it. We all need to know what Pacelle emphasizes: we\u2019ve always had a bond with all animals, so we have a responsibility to see that they are not abused and to do what we can to discourage abuse."}, {"userName": "Gaby", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1185483-gaby", "userReview": "In The Bond, Wayne Pacelle delivers a systematic analysis of our treatment of animals from those that we keep as pets, those that are raised for food, service animals, and those that live in the wild. Pacelle touches on the disturbingly cruel behavior of Michael Vicks and his dog fighting friends. Pacelle interviews Vicks and we learn how the athlete became so deeply involved in dog fighting and the manner and nature of his \"conversion\" to an advocate for animal rights. The sincerity of his conversion is hard to evaluate but Pacelle testified to the power of Vicks' influence especially on young men. Vicks makes a difference each time he speaks to a room full of children and teens about how much he regrets the pain that he'd caused and his advocacy for a kind and humane way to treat animals.I expected to be upset by the descriptions of dog fighting, cockfighting, animal blood sports and hunting but I was particularly disturbed by the description of puppy mills. I never liked how pet stores keep for puppies in small cages, but Pacelle's account of the breeders' premises was worse than anything that I'd imagined. Pacelle systematically attacks many of the myths that I'd believed about purebred dogs and their breeders and sellers. While the genetic defects and vulnerabilities of purebred dogs are well recognized, it's hard to imagine that dogs are kept in such close confinement without exercise, fresh air or proper socialization. The breeding dogs and their offspring are often kept in cramped, unsanitary, and dangerous conditions.Pacelle examines the raising and slaughtering of animals. His account of the \"agro-industrial complex\" is much like that described by Jonathan Safran Foer in Eating Animals. Reading both books within months of each other makes me think twice about my consumption of meat and dairy products. If you have wondered about how we treat the animals around us, The Bond will give you a comprehensive and detailed account. It has led me to examine my behavior more carefully. I'm grateful for the work that activists have done to draw attention to animal suffering.ISBN-10: 0061969788 - Hardcover $26.99Publisher: William Morrow (April 5, 2011), 448 pages.Review copy provided by the publisher."}, {"userName": "Kathleen (Kat) Smith", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4328680-kathleen-kat-smith", "userReview": "On the cover of the New York Times Bestseller, The Bond by Wayne Pacelle, depicts a young child hugging a dog in a field and immediately the readers thoughts are that this is a book about the bond we feel to our animal friends/pets but do not be deceived.Wayne Pacelle is the President and CEO for the Humane Society of the United States and author of this novel. In it, the reader is exposed to the practices that go on around the world in regards to the treatment of animals, from puppy mills, slaughterhouses that produce our meat products, dog fighting and other animal blood sports such as hunting, National Park malpractices, science labs, fur industry businesses, and reckless breeding practices. The stories contained in this book are not for the faint of heart and likely to produce quite a few vegetarians after reading this book.This book takes cruelty to animals to a whole new level exposing about every single possibility you can think of. This is definitely a pro-life book at the protection against animals everywhere and a definite must read if you have no idea of what goes on when it comes to anything to do with animals and animal rights. I'm sure you've all heard of one animal protection group at one time or another and this book takes a great majority of those situations and compiles them into one concise book.I received this book compliments of William Morrow, a division of Harper Collins Publishers for my honest review and honestly believed this to be a book about the bond we share with our animal friends. Even so, looking at it in its entirety, as a reader who may be a bit naive on the subject of the practices of some forms of animal cruelty, this was an eye opener. The one thing I did love is a chapter devoted to things you can do to lend a hand to preventing animal cruelty and loads of tips and websites to check into. I highly recommend this book to readers who are against animal cruelty and for anyone wanting to know more into what goes on when it comes to the care and uses of our animal friends. For me, as a Christian, I personally feel an obligation to care for our animals as the stewards of the Earth that God has placed in our hands.

First, there is a case made for our connectedness to animals. Most of the book, though, provides insight into the different ways that mankind can be abusive/cruel to animals: the plight of cows, pigs, and chickens on the mega farms that provide so much of the meat we eat to dogfighting (including much on Michael Vick) to the barbaric way baby seals are clubbed in Canada. Pacelle, the president & CEO of the Humane Society of America, argues throughout that the animal cruelty that exists is avoidable through implementation of reasonable laws, the main objective of the HSUS.On a personal level, this book impacted me mostly \"where I live\" - or more accurately where & what I eat.

Not at all what I expected considering the title, as the book spends little time discussing the biological and psychological connection that we humans feel towards protecting our furry friends. This gets touched on a little bit in the earlier chapters where Pacelle discusses a few historical anecdotes of the important roles that animals played in various cultures and societies, as well as even the chapter about his meeting with Michael Vick as well as numerous hunters where he dives into how men who are self-professed to love animals and stand in such awe of them can do such terrible things to them.But the vast majority of the book is centered around the battles which the Humane Society has encountered against animal cruelty. The book itself could be case study in economics, as time and time again, those who are in favor of such brutality do so out of personal incentives (i.e. usually $$$) and often quite short-sightedly so. Pacelle brings up the role of the HSUS to pass the legislation in California a few years ago to improve the conditions for factory farming of chickens. If anyone has ever seen a chicken processing plant, I\ufffdm quite sure you\ufffdll swear off the noble bird from now on, perhaps only in favor of those named Oliver who are given room to live a happy life in a farm outside of Portland. The stories are all true about the atrocious conditions in which 10 birds at a time are stuffed in a cage no larger than a small dog crate, where the poor chickens at the bottom are of a different color from the fecal matter stemming down. This sight alone should force you to pass legislation on account of public health let alone animal cruelty. With current conditions allowing for each chicken to occupy no more than an 8\ufffdx10\ufffd space in such factory farms, legislation sought to improve this for the sake of both the animals\ufffd health/well-being prior to slaughter which in turn is reflective of the health/well-being of us humans who consume animals in such decrepit conditions. And of course where the word \ufffdregulation\ufffd arises, even in pre-tea party days, the response from industry lobbying groups was that this would cripple the meat processing industry and kill jobs. Just as passage of the consumer protection act to limit predatory lending practices by credit card issuers would lead to the demise of the credit card and force us all back to a cash-only society, and of course kill jobs. And the affordable care act? Kill jobs of course. Nevermind that such predatory practices are what led us into a debt-burdened society that actually has \ufffdkilled jobs\ufffd\ufffd but playing the Cassandra role of chicken little to spur public fear is undoubtedly effective. As part of this same measure, Pacelle sought to pass regulation in which \ufffddowned\ufffd cows could not be slaughtered for meat. Downed cows are those who are so disease ridden and sickly from the terrible factory conditions that they are unable to walk and need to be carried by forklift to slaughter. And the industry\ufffds response? Putting this measure in place would of course kill jobs. And just as climate change skeptics seize onto that information which benefits their own personal incentives, they cited some obscure, non peer-reviewed, and highly sketchy study which proclaimed the safety of eating such animals. Lo and behold, consumption of downed cows is what led to the proliferation of Crutzfeld-Jacob disease (Mad cow), ultimately costing the beef industry $11MMM/yr in exports after South Korea and others banned imports of American Beef. Yep\ufffd and it\ufffds the legislation that would kill jobs eh? Such measure ultimately did pass, but only after the Mad Cow debacle ensued and industry lobbyists retreated with their tails between their legs so as to quickly forget that it was their own drive for profit and greed that led to numerous deaths, and huge losses in profit in the long-term caused by their short-term motives.Another story? That of the effort to ban cockfighting. Who knew that there was a big cockfighting lobby? And that this brutal \ufffdsport\ufffd was only made illegal a few years ago in the last of the American states? Evidently those breeders of fighting birds had their own lobby and were able to contribute sufficient amounts of money to help get their own cronies elected. Such cronies who opposed legislation attempts by stating, surprise surprise, that ending cockfighting would kill jobs. Interestingly, a few also cited that banning cockfighting would end an American tradition that is a good family event to bring children to. Considering that the last measure passed with 87% against cockfighting, it\ufffds not so surprising that these senators quickly lost re-election.So in the end, a well-written recollection with the moral that abuse of animals is not far down the slope of abuse of humanity. I do appreciate that Pacelle is open-minded and does not try to force his agenda upon others, nor is he opposed to consumption of animals\ufffd just the way to do so in a measure that maintains the dignity of such other living/breathing souls since how we treat them is in itself a reflection of who we are. The book is itself also a case-study in the lobbying-dominated Roman Empire-esque political and social result of what happens when democracy goes wild. Time and time again, I reject the Ayn Rand libertarian policy that every man for himself results in a stronger society as a whole. If your goal is \ufffdcumulative individualism\ufffd, why the fuck live in societies at all? Only because of how you can benefit from your neighbor? Is profit and individual gain the only purpose in life? I for one only need to spend 5mins with my dog Linus to remind me the answer to that is clearly NO."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23865-rachel", "userReview": "My main complaint with this book would be in how it is marketed\u2014primarily as a focus on the human-animal bond.

Throughout history we have justified our actions by convincing ourselves and then declaring that animals operate only by instinct, devoid of emotion and consciousness nor the ability to feel pain. In this view, animals never play just for the fun of it\u2014no, it\u2019s always about honing mechanistic survival skills. When Charles Darwin tried to tell us this was not true, we ignored him (see Darwin\u2019s \u201cThe Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals\u201d of 1872). Pacelle writes in the Preface: \u201cEspecially within the last two hundred years, we\u2019ve come to apply an industrial mind-set to the use of animals, too often viewing them as if they were nothing but articles of commerce and the raw material of science, agriculture, and wildlife management. Here, as in other pursuits, human ingenuity has a way of outrunning human conscience\u2026\u201d He listens carefully to the arguments for and against these actions, recounts some of the gains as well as setbacks to the animal welfare movements, and even hails Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio for his zero tolerance toward cruelty to animals. He plunges into the world of factory farming, animal fighting, and pet and wildlife abuse. He discusses the Humane Society\u2019s program that offers tips to people on how to deal with wild creatures who\u2019ve decided that some part of your home or landscape makes a good nesting site, resting spot, or playground. He presents a list of fifty ways you can help animals.\u201cFor a long time, in our dealings with animals, we have conducted ourselves like beings from another world, unfeeling, all-powerful, and strangely disconnected from the realities of animal consciousness and emotion. But it shouldn\u2019t be such a stretch to recognize how much we have in common with creatures made of the same flesh and blood, or to imagine ourselves in their place\u2014helpless, vulnerable, and afraid.\u201dI will return to this book time and time again for guidance."}, {"userName": "Taylor P", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12738694-taylor-p", "userReview": "I think that The Bond: Our Kinship with Animals, Our Call to Defend Them by Wayne Pacelle was an amazing book. In the book Pacelle talks about the bad treatment of animals, from puppy mills, slaughterhouses that produce our meat products, dog fighting and other animal blood sports, National Park malpractices, science labs, fur industry businesses, and reckless breeding practices. The Bond exposes a different side of life that is usually ignored. A part that was meaningful to me was with the elephant named Babe.Babe was a baby elephant in South Africa in the 1980\u2019s. In the 1980\u2019s South Africa\u2019s government killed removed entire herds of elephants. Babe\u2019s whole family was killed, but she lived because she could be sold to the circus. She ended up being bought by \u201cThe U.S.-based Jorge Barreda Circus\u201d. That she was bought by a U.S. company and treated badly surprised me, because I believed the U.S. had strong animal cruelty laws and was surprised that that could happen. While Babe was with the circus she got a foot and leg injury, which was not properly taken care of and became permanent. \u201cThe Circus cast her aside, and that\u2019s when Cleveland Amory and the Fund for Animals stepped in, acquiring her and retiring her to Black Beauty Ranch on Valentine\u2019s Day in 1996\u201d. The resin that part and that story meant so much to me is that I was born Valentine\u2019s Day 1996, so when I read that part I felt a connection with Babe. So the title says: The Bond in my heart I felt that bond it made want to keep reading, to see if I could make that connection with other stories, and I could.A meaningful part in the book to me was with the elephant named Babe.

Instead, a more apt cover art would simply be Mr. Pacelle\u2019s author photo, perhaps in front of the headquarters of the Humane Society. Or in front of a slaughterhouse. The majority of animal stories contained here are nothing more than depressing. This is a political work, not scientific in any way. There is a historical angle, but it is more in line with a memoir\u2019s historical angle as Pacelle relays the successes and setbacks of the Humane Society during Pacelle\u2019s tenure there. As a memoirist, Pacelle does not come off as very sympathetic, either. In many instances he appears to be quite the elitist. And while it is evident that he attempted to be as inoffensive as possible, he may have tried too hard - because the end result in many places is an assortment of total ambivalence, sentences completely contradictory to earlier statements and thinly veiled offensive tones.So while I was overall quite disappointed, especially since I purchased this in hard cover - at least the proceeds go to the Humane Society, so I don\u2019t completely regret my purchase."}, {"userName": "Peggy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8993273-peggy", "userReview": "To me, animals are native tribes.

For far too long, we have tried to make widgets of animals, tried to diminish their intelligence, assert human supremacy and deny them rights to share the planet in peace. For too long, people who empathize with animals have been accused of \"anthropomorphising\" the behavior of animals. Animals are not humans, but we fail them as fellow Earthlings.

Wayne Pacelle, President of the Humane Society of the United States, covers in-depth the key areas where man betrays animals and how animals suffer for man, including in: factory farming, animal fighting, domestic pets--puppy mills and bad breeders, the attack on wildlife by farmers/ranchers and by the U.S. government, and the organizations such as the NRA, AVMA and Safari Club International that defend animal cruelty and exploit animals.
