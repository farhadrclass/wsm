{"ratings": 2, "userreviews": [], "description": "Lauri Foster believes that it is her calling in life to be a doctor. Lauri however, is a complete idiot and is no way qualified to be a doctor, let alone a student in medical school. One day, after failing an exam in her bio-analytical chemistry course Lauri leaves class (before it even starts) and heads straight to one of her favorite bars to meet one of her favorite bar tenders (who is giving out more than just free drinks). Later that night Lauri meets two strangers at a bar, who attempt to offer some helpful advice. Lauri learns a valuable lesson and life and goes on to be a hero in her own special way. We all know at least one person like Lauri Foster. She is someone we all know, hate, and sympathize for.Lauri Foster is the first short story by Frank Linn.", "title": "Lauri Foster", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17832434-lauri-foster", "average": 4.0, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1366653836l/17832434.jpg", "reviews": 0, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5758895.Frank_Linn", "name": "Frank Linn"}], "type": ["Short Stories", "Humor", "Academic"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17832434-lauri-foster", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20666412-the-mayonnaise-affair", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17835808-denied-tenure", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22462497-the-mayonnaise-affair"]}
