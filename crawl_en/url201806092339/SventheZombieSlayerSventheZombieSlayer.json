For body builder Sven it started with his spotter wondering off while he was trying to break his own record. For Jane it was worrying about her sick house mate before heading off to work. For Lorie, that big track meet later in the day. Milt just wanted to play some WoW. But then everything got weird and the dead started to rise.\tI\u2019m going to admit now that I love zombie movies, zombie novels on the other hand are something that I\u2019ve kind of skipped over for whatever reason. Guy James\u2019 Sven the Zombie Slayer could change that. The characters are, for the most part, as freaked out by zombies suddenly arising as any normal human probably would be. They each get their quirks and funny character moments. They don\u2019t all sound alike, each gets a voice unique to them. Sven starts the book sounding like a meathead who puts too much time into his exercise routine. Milt on the other hand uses the kind of bastardized English that tends to show up with internet users who vastly overestimate both their own intelligence and other people\u2019s lack thereof. Considering the amount of juggling James does, the difference in voices is rather nice. He also used a rather interesting take on the zombies themselves, having them quickly become dried out rather than rotting at a more normal rate. It was also rather interesting to see the main characters trying to work with and around each other. This isn\u2019t a movie where the over confidant young guy gets himself and half of the named cast killed by doing something that sounded like a good idea at the time. These characters have seen those movies and know what to expect. It gives them a level of genre savvy that\u2019s both refreshing and gets to lead to character development.\tThat said, the characters tend to do a lot of cyclical thinking. Sven is always going to worry about his muscles at some point in the chapter. Jane is always going to get introspective when she\u2019s the viewpoint character. Milt is going to blather about his superiority regardless of whom he\u2019s speaking to if he isn\u2019t just basking in it to himself. There were some redundant bits of storytelling and dialogue but nothing so bad that it didn\u2019t feel like the characters were being written more towards an attempt at the way people think and react to things. The focus on Sven\u2019s cat also felt a bit odd at times. Not a \u201cwhy\u2019s this guy taking his cat zombie hunting\u201d way, more that the cat seemed like a bit of a catch all plot coupon. I\u2019m also not a huge fan of the \u201cTo Be Continued\u201d on the last page, but it fits with some of the more movie like elements of the writing.\tSo, where does that leave me for a review? I enjoyed the story. The writing was good regardless of stylistic choices. I\u2019m giving it a four out of five and more jokes about bad zombie movies than I really want to think about."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15411105-karen", "userReview": "This was a good book with likeable characters and one you will hate or pity. The zombies are localized to the Virginia area and so no one is aware of how or why they have started to walk.The title character, Sven, is a competitive bodybuilder who works as a personal trainer. He is working out with his friend and spotter, Lars, in his basement as the zombies start to walk. When the action begins Sven can only think to grab his cat, Ivan, and run. Sven rescues Jane, his ex-girlfriend, and they take off for a safe place. Jane has had her own bad morning and is glad to see him. She appears to be a quiet person, but has a love of guns that comes in handy in this situation.On their journey they run into two teenagers, Lorie and Evan, who are also looking for a safe place. Lorie runs track and has an unhealthy predilection for up close carnage, but is very good at it.The story moves swiftly from scene to scene and will keep you wanting more. There seems to be a mystical quality which is not fully explored so expect more in coming volumes.If you like/love zombies I would say to give this a look and decide for yourself."}, {"userName": "Janice Kujawa", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55742683-janice-kujawa", "userReview": "Great ReadNo spoilers. Must read for yourself. Little bit of a twist on regular Zombie books. Must find out for yourself.

In their sections of the book, the thread of humor is pretty decent. I do like a bit of humor mixed in with the horror.Unfortunately, the book was pretty much ruined by Milt. Milt is a big, fat, slob, and the writer takes every, and I do mean every, opportunity to hammer that fact home. Paragraph, after paragraph, after paragraph describes Milt's gigantic shape, his disgusting hygiene, and personal habits. One entire page was devoted to Milt popping a zit on his face.The descriptions of Milt were far more gross than any description of the zombies. Milt was a grotesque cartoon caricature, and I ended up skimming a lot of his sections, they were just waaaay too much.The reason I decided to review the book anyway is because there were a few fresh ideas, and the other characters are actually pretty decent. I liked the dried out zombies. The reason for them was a little weak, but still interesting.I doubt I'll read any more of this series. I don't think I can handle more of this writer's idea of humor. Oh, and I did like Ivan the cat. He's worth half a star, at least."}, {"userName": "Kim Luu", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3866927-kim-luu", "userReview": "I didn't expect much due to the title but got it because I love zombies and it tickled my fancy. The book was actually enjoyable and well written. It presented a fairly realistic reactions by the survivors and how they would react. There were not too many stupid or deux ex machina situations. Sven is a body builder and suddenly, when the world went bad, Sven had to figure out how to survive while rescuing random people that he came across. My favorite character is the poor vegan who is used to eating nothing but organic food - very difficult to do when you have no access to fresh produce. I have several vegan friends and frankly, they would not survive a zombie apocalypse. Their finicky taste and constant lectures about food would doom us while we argue about how to feed ourselves.

An attempt to use \"shock tactics\" to cover the inexperience, a noticeable lack of professional editing (I know Editors are expensive), and examining every tiny step(in a literal sense)to achieve a certain word-count.I could not finish the story, for the step-by-step narration interfered with my enjoyment."}, {"userName": "Terri", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7030851-terri", "userReview": "It isn't often that I read a book and feel like I might throw up. Now this might sound like a bad thing but to me it just shows how graffic and well written this was. The way the character Milt was discribed and the discription of zombie gore was really good almost as if l could see and unfortunately smell it. A very good zombie story."}, {"userName": "Shana Festa", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9185553-shana-festa", "userReview": "This was a different take on the outbreak than I've read in the past.

The story was pretty z/a basic, although it did take a few interesting turns at times. What really made it a great read were the characters and the humor. Someone needs to make this into a movie.
