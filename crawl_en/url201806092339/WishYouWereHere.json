I had never heard of the book before but when I met her i received \"Wish You Were Here\" got it signed and was really excited to start reading it. The main character is Ariel, she has to go on a vacation with her family, including her mom, her annoying sister, grandparents and her crazy uncle. When Ariel imagined the summer it did not include a boring vacation with her family, she just wanted to hang out with her boyfriend Dylan and her cat. Not only is she going on a boring vacation touring the Nevadas with senior citizens, her mom is also very against technology being used on family vacations. Not only is she away from her boyfriend Dylan, she needs to be creative when trying to communicate,while she is on vacation and he is at camp, she is afraid their relationship will not last because of the long distance. I think this is a good book for any teenager because they will be able to relate to almost all of it, at least i know i did."}, {"userName": "Nick", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/724379-nick", "userReview": "This is one of those stories that is alternately touching and funny. It never gets serious enough to bog down, and never quite wacky enough to be unbelievable.The main character belongs to a family which has broken down. The father gambled away all their money and some that he probably embezzled. The mother, a therapist who has been writing books about solving family problems, has failed miserably at solving her own family's problems. Ariel, 16, and Zena, 12, have been tormented ever since their father's problems became public. Their mother's solution: road trip, aboard the strangest tour bus in the history of tourism.The book will appeal mostly to teen girls, but anyone who works with teens or with troubled adults may enjoy it. Teen and adult characters all learn something during this odd trip, and the author handled them well."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Wardrip", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1125613-jennifer-wardrip", "userReview": "Reviewed by Sally Kruger aka \"Readingjunky\" for TeensReadToo.comWhat do you get when you combine a bus load of senior citizens, a couple of teens, a mailman with a fear of squirrels, and a stowaway Chihuahua? Pick up a copy of WISH YOU WERE HERE, and you'll find out. Ariel Flack, not named after the little mermaid, is about to embark on the adventure of her life. Her mother recently divorced her gambling-addict husband and has decided a road trip is just what they need. However, Ariel and her younger sister are shocked to learn that their dear mother has not been completely truthful. Instead of traveling by car, they are joining their grandparents and their eccentric uncle on a week-long bus tour. The prospect of spending even a short time in the company of a bus load of senior citizens being escorted by a wacky husband and wife tour guide team has Ariel ready to lace up her favorite running shoes and head for the hills. She had to leave behind her new boyfriend and her beloved cat for this! Fortunately, the seating arrangements place her next to another frustrated teen named Andre who was also tricked into the tour by his controlling mother. Together Ariel and Andre find ways to endure the agony of the Leisure-Lee bus tour company's idea of a good time - endless listening to the soundtrack of Oklahoma, visiting scenic wonders like the one of the world's largest ball of knitting yarn, and eating buffalo burgers in the Badlands. At times the two seriously consider ditching the tour and heading off on their own, but in the end, they both discover more than they bargained for on this crazy adventure. I've always been a fan of Catherine Clark's work, and I'm happy to say, I think WISH YOU WERE HERE is her best yet. There are wonderful characters, great humor, and heart-warming family moments that make this a delightful read."}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/406332-nancy", "userReview": "Ariel Flack\u2019s \u201cno comment\u201d response to Fox News when the reporters bombard her with questions about her father\u2019s gambling addiction and losing everyone\u2019s money all around, brings Ariel\u2019s school year down the drain. Now that her parents are divorced, her father broke and claiming to be have stopped going to casinos, the Flack family are taking a two week long surprise bus tour\u2014or so the tour guides say. Not too pleased about spending the summer away from her semi-boyfriend Dylan, she sends him postcards and vows to meet him in Wyoming where he works as a camp counselor, even if she has to pack her bags and run away with Andre\u2014the only sane tour buddy\u2014at the crack of dawn. Catherine Clark has really improved since her Main Squeeze days with this book. It\u2019s witty, charming, humorous, and by far, this is my favorite of her\u2019s. The postcard format is very inspiring. Really. The quotes\u2014famous sayings, catch phrases, and slogans\u2014are very catchy, and they almost make me want to run outside and spin the postcard rack to find a witty card that I can write lame stuff on. And it\u2019s really fitting for the story, since Ariel is on a road trip, so she\u2019s visiting all sorts of places. As a girl who\u2019s never gone further than Pennsylvania and hasn\u2019t brought a postcard since (possibly) eight years ago, the urge to follow the trend sounds almost silly. I\u2019m \u201cin the moment\u201d, I guess, which will pass in a couple of hours when I move on to my next book. Even though this novel is finished, I still can\u2019t help but smile remembering it. Ariel\u2019s wit and humor will probably stay with me for quite a while, especially while I try to remember some of her famous lines. Let me try to find a few of those laugh-out-loud moments. Ah, here\u2019s one: \u201cShe\u2019s always saying this about my mother, which probably isn\u2019t that cool a quality in a mother-in-law. Or an ex-mother-in-law, which I guess would be a mother outlaw\u201d (Clark 16). Hahahah. Okay. I\u2019m too lazy to look for other stuff."}, {"userName": "Sabrina", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24007544-sabrina", "userReview": "Wish You Were Here, is an amazing book for young teenage girls, full of adventure,romance and overall hilarious. The author Catherine Clark has done a phenomenal job one Wish You Were Here. This suspenseful yet at times can be a clich\u00e9 book, was one book I could not stop reading.\tAriel, a young teenage girl goes on a bus tour to the West with her family, along with some senior citizens. She meets a boy on the tour who is the same age as herself. Ariel gets stuck on the bus with everybody, which leads to romance, humor and one crazy adventure.\tIn the book Wish You Were Here, the three strongest points in my opinion were; characters, plot and the writing style. In my opinion, the characters were very well developed. Ariel is a very down to earth character. Ariel's younger sister Zena is four years younger than Ariel. She is very humors and tries to be the center of attention. Zena flirts with a guy but is not very successful. Many of the characters reminded me of my family at times. I was also quite fond of the plot. The book at times was suspenseful yet clich\u00e9. When Ariel met this boy on her road trip it was very suspenseful when they would be together. In the start of the book though it was a little clich\u00e9 to me, when she was with her boyfriend. Catherine Clark's writing style made me not want to put it down. She used very expressive words through out her book.\t Romance, comedy and adventure are my favorite topics. The book \u201cWish You Were Here\u201d had all three of my wishes. Catherine Clark is a wonderful author and I look forward to reading more of her books. I would give \u201cWish You Were Here\u201d a 4.5, only because the book sometimes was clich\u00e9."}, {"userName": "Cassie Pettit", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23716541-cassie-pettit", "userReview": "During the summer Ariel the main character gets stuck on a road trip with her mother and her annoying little sister. Ariel would rather be home with her boyfriend and her cat. but it turned out that it wasn't just them going on a road trip together it was them plus their uncle grandparents and more old people that were going to leisure lee on a bus. Ariel notices that there is one other teen on the bus and his name is Andre and they become really close during the trip and Dylan her boyfriend is not even returning her emails he also is hinting at she can date someone else so Ariel don\u2019t know if he is cheating on her so she don't know what to do. Ariel's father recently came back after just leaving the family so he comes back in the picture and she don't know what to do there if she should talk to him, trust him and even believe what he has to say to her. \tI would recommend it to someone who thinks their parents/ family is lame so they understand that some things can be fun and even if it sounds corny just go with it you don\u2019t know if it will be fun or who you will meet on the way there or there at the place you're going to you can make memories on the way there and make new friends, they may also get it because maybe they don\u2019t know who their dad is or maybe they just left and came back so it might help with what they can say to them or if they are still hurt by them leaving they can just ignore them. I would also recommend it to teenagers because it is a boyfriend girlfriend book teenagers because they are in relationships right now in their life and they get what is going on between Dylan and Ariel."}, {"userName": "Allison Martin", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46346492-allison-martin", "userReview": "I enjoyed the book \"Wish You Were Here\" by Catherine Clark. I found that the entire story kept my attention and I always looked forward to reading another part of the book. I wish that this was a series of books because I am sad that I finished reading it.  Ariel is a high school student whose parents are divorced and she keeps saying she really likes her boyfriend, Dylan. Though her boyfriend is at camp all summer and her mom is making her go on a road trip with her family on a bus. She is not going to see her boyfriend at all this summer. On the bus she meets a cute new boy, and at the same time she is sending many postcards to Dylan. During boy drama, she was facing family issues about her mom, dad and little sister. There are so many surprises in this story that make you not want to put this book down.

This somewhat spontaneous, mostly lame (according to Ariel), vacation comes after finding out her father has a serious gambling problem--so serious he embezzeled from the company he worked for and caused her parents to divorce. Her mother's edict of no ipod, no cell phone, no e-mail, only us, only makes it worse for Ariel because the one bright spot in her disasterous life is Dylan--the boy who saved her from major embarrassment at the prom. Without any electronic communication Ariel resorts to scouring all the tourist stops for postcards to send to Dylan, her best friend Sarah and her cat Gloves. The antics of the tour guides, other tourists and Ariel's family members make for an interesting vacation and an amusing read."}, {"userName": "Joanna", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/522780-joanna", "userReview": "For summer vacation, Ariel need to spend it with her recently-divorced mom and her sister, Zena, in a bus tour with a bunch of senior citizens.
