The banter between the guys is excellent and had me chuckling along in several places as the (admittedly simple) characters were sketched in. Then the zombie threat emerges, and after a few early losses, the survivors find themselves holed up within Charlie's home while the infected surround them and attempt to get in. So while this part all sounds bog standard, it's what happens from here that differs significantly. Instead of the usual pain, angst, grim nihilism and sadness that descends upon proceedings in this type of novel, Johnson spins things in a different direction. His \"heroes\" instead proceed to get drunk, stoned and otherwise off their individual faces, and in so doing instantly accept what's happening around them - all while continuing to rip each other a new one whenever the opportunity arises. Until, inevitably, things start to go awry ...Hit back on your browser right here if you only want the grim nastiness of the apocalypse in your chosen reads. But if you're open to something that is much lighter and generally fairly silly, then this book might just be for you. Generally, I fall into the former category, but I was up for something less intense, and for the first half, Dead Drunk perfectly addressed what I was looking for. The writing was economical, the humour fairly strong, and you could feel disaster looming for the characters.Unfortunately, Johnson seemed to lose a bit of focus in the back half as he adds a couple of subplots that brought little to the main storyline, the humour starts to wear a little thin (as it does with most comedies, if I'm being honest), and the characters reactions to events becomes less and less relatable. For example, at one point, a member of the group is killed in a spectacular fashion and barely anybody even blinks an eye. All of which in the end brought this back to a 3 star read for me - albeit one which was very entertaining for its first half.Just to be clear, I plan on following Charlie and his surviving friends in the sequel to Dead Drunk at some point in future. I just need a few dark, gritty, more realistic apocalypses to cleanse my palate before doing so.3 Missing Right Nuts for Dead Drunk: Surviving the Zombie Apocalypse ...

Often times the moral of the story when it comes to apocalyptic fiction is that the screw ups tend to get their comeuppance. Someone might have some dumb luck and avoid getting slaughtered right away, but for the most part, if you are a coward, an imbecile, or a callous, crass, self-absorbed fool you either wise up right away, transform into some sort of crony to the chief bad guy, or die in a very gruesome and often satisfying way, presuming that the author has made you despise said person throughout the tale.In Dead Drunk we are introduced to Charlie and his band of misfit friends. Most of them are thirty-something slackers who are horny, drunk, drug addled party boys focused on little more than where they can get their next buzz. Some of us remember guys like these from college-or at least our first year of college, before many of them flunked out. Of course, Charlie does have some friends who are responsible adults who like to have fun every now and then, and that is where our story begins. One of Charlie\u2019s more responsible buddies is getting married and that is an excuse for a rager of a bachelor party. Things get wild, of course, but it isn\u2019t until the next day, when everyone is nursing their hangovers that the real party begins. An infection has spread through Chicago, where the story takes place, and suddenly people are chomping on one another, spreading whatever infection has caused them to crave human flesh and go completely nutso. Charlie and his friends hunker down in his rundown apartment, trying to figure out how to survive with minimal food but a whole lot of booze. This story is a mix of traditional zombie survival and crazy party-boy lunacy, with a rogues gallery of characters that most of us would find hard to like, except perhaps if you are in that period of life where getting drunk, trying to get some action, and being permanently buzzed supersedes all else. Certainly, the author does a commendable job of showing hints of maturity among the group and slivers of humanity amongst them. Charlie shows signs of becoming a better man and Big Rob, one of his best friends, for all his oafishness, is probably the best person of the lot. It helped prevent me from rooting for the demise of all of them from the beginning.Of course, this is an amusing book, not meant to be taken too seriously. I didn\u2019t go in expecting there to be an emotional attachment to any of the characters, though a few were formed and there were a few touching moments buried in a sea of booze, bongs, and boners that reside within its pages. The writing is solid and the humor rude. So if you are someone who easily offended or doesn\u2019t appreciate the humor of movies like The Hangover, this probably isn\u2019t for you. But if you enjoy low-brow comedy mixed in with your zombie gore on occasion, give this one a shot."}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11032293-jill", "userReview": "My husband and I both LOVED this book. I\u2019ve recommended it to several friends and will continue to do so. It had me giggling like a crazy person so many times, but at the same time, created characters I really cared about and a storyline that was easy to follow, but meaningful. The compassion for animals in the book was also a good touch that I appreciated as a dog and horse person. That just added even more depth to the story and insight into the characters. I even liked the political \"snipes\" (not sure of the right word), including the ones that swing the way I lean!Just such a really enjoyable book, and I think there will be a sequel. I will not miss that book, or any other books from the author!"}, {"userName": "Janene", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1739786-janene", "userReview": "How many times have we seen this cover on other books?Fast forward...Okay....so, now that I got my gripe about the over-used cover off my chest (see authors response in comments), I can review Dead Drunk. I wasn't even going to read this one right away after downloading it to my kindle, but for some reason...I think it was 'meeting' Richard Johnson, and saw what a nice, normal guy he is....I became more than curious and put my other 5 books on-hold to read it. I read another review that said this story is what you'd get if The Hangover met The Zombie Apocalypse...and they were pretty much spot on, so I'm going to stick with that. A bunch of party buddies gathered for a bachelor party and all hell breaks loose. What I first noticed was that the story doesn't start out smack-dab in the midst of the apocalypse, like most tend to do. No, the author takes his time to introduce us to each of the buddies...each of them with their share of issues, and most of the guys we don't especially care for. As I'm reading and shaking my head (and chuckling a little bit)...I'm totally getting pulled in to the story and suddenly realize...'oh ya! This is a zombie book!' I appreciated this...because I was enjoying the book enough that I wasn't being impatient for the first person to get devoured. My reviews rarely tell you what the book is about, as you can read that in the book description. One thing my reviews DO contain...especially for Indie authors...is a little commentary on the editing. So here goes. I walked into this book with both eyes peeled and let me say that I could not find a single flaw. Mr Johnson cared enough about his readers to produce a very clean product, and that deserves mention. So...this book, that annoyed me because of the cover, but I had to have it because it was a zombie book, completely entertained me and I would most definitely read what the author comes up with next. I hope he gives me a heads-up. :-)Recommended."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16623628-lisa", "userReview": "Yeah, yeah...I hate to admit this, but I think I actually lost some brain cells reading this book.

Whereas the characters in The Walking Dead get all sullen and existential when they run low on food, the degenerates in Richard Johnson\u2019s novel say fuck it, let\u2019s pound beers and eat cat food. Sadly, for me and my friends, this is a very real possibility with or without the apocalypse. Charlie is their de facto leader. He\u2019s substitute teacher who sets the tone at the beginning of the novel when, like the petty drunk he is, he purposely fails a first grader for pissing him off while sipping on a rum and coke. My kind of guy. The rest of the cast consists of a racist cop, a pervert, a foreigner, everybody\u2019s hated white trash conservative uncle, a closeted gay guy who endures homophobic slurs from his buddies (until they find out he really is gay and accept him without hesitation), a survivalist hippie and many more. They shouldn\u2019t be surviving the zombie apocalypse, yet they endure. They\u2019re mostly content with doing shots, smoking dope and swimming in a kiddy pool, all while talking shit to each other within the confines of the survivalist hippie\u2019s fortified apartment. The shit talking between zombie attacks is the best part. I found myself more interested in their juvenile insults than I did their battles with the undead, although the action is funny as well because these guys suck at it. The cop is a bad shot. The former MMA fighter has a beer gut and almost gets eaten alive while passed out in the back yard after dropping a deuce. And, oh yeah, he wakes up with a boner, because of course he does. These fellas are not heroes. When they encounter a pair of starving females, their first thought isn\u2019t to save them, but whether or not the girls will trade sex for cat food. When they see a child stuck in a tree, besieged by the undead, it takes them three days to save him, and even then just barely. They\u2019re unapologetic when they do the things we hope we wouldn\u2019t during the apocalypse. There\u2019s the obligatory band of criminal marauders (who are, naturally, out looking for medicine for the boss\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s puppy), but I won\u2019t spoil their appearance, I\u2019ll just say it\u2019s fitting. By the time the Chinese military shows up, everything has been going bonkers for so long that you\u2019ll just nod and say, \u201cYup, now the communists are here for some reason,\u201d without skipping a beat. Some readers will be offended by the banter and some uncomfortable racial stereotypes. Yes, an angry black man named Tyrone threatens to call Jesse Jackson and a Chinese soldier actually says \u201cOf course I love egg roll!\u201d At first I was put off, then I realized this book is full of stereotypes, including the racist white cop and conservative uncle. Don\u2019t let it bother you. This book doesn\u2019t have time for nuance. It\u2019s too busy having fun.

It's a zombie novel about a guy I wound up rooting for even though he's a loser. The humor is lowbrow, the beer flows freely, and the silliness quotient is high (literally, part of the time). In many places, this book is entirely preposterous, and that's exactly how it should be.I found myself laughing out loud at several points. Although the antics of the survivors can be over the top at times, it's still hilarious. Be forewarned there is a lot of drunk guy humor, guy sex humor, and some drug humor. These guys drink, use assorted drugs, and talk about sex and genitalia a lot.A few scenes did bother me a tiny bit, ones depicting mildly disturbing violence. Obviously, there are zombies, so there's violence, and that's not what I'm referring to. The survivors engage in and discuss some morally questionable activities that sensitive readers will blanch at. Their choices aren't always the 'heroic' ones, which is probably the reason any of them manage to survive.The only things I actually disliked about this book were some odd scenes out, all of them jam-packed with backstory. One of them even confused me, because I had no idea what was going on until the end of the chapter. Aside from the one major hiccup, the tale is woven well and the characters are well done.I recommend this for people who like Shaun of the Dead and similar stories."}, {"userName": "Michael Flanagan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3789573-michael-flanagan", "userReview": "What do you do when it's the end of the world and everyone around you is trying to eat you?

What originally compelled me to purchase this book was the fact that it had humor in it, and good humor books are far and few between, sadly. A reviewer likened Dead Drunk to The Hangover, except with zombies. When I first read that comparison, I was worried about the caliber of humor we would experience. But Johnson\u2019s wit was clever and resulted in numerous laugh out loud moments. Just read the first line and you'll instantly see what I'm talking about.Dead Drunk follows Charlie Campbell and his dysfunctional friends after a night out on the town. Hung-over, they awake to find themselves in the middle of a zombie apocalypse. So, naturally, they respond by drinking more beer. The pacing is quick and you negotiate with yourself after the ending of each chapter. \u201cJust one more,\u201d I kept saying. Which is why I devoured the book in a half of a day.So why only three cups? While I thoroughly enjoyed the book and definitely plan on purchasing the sequel, I felt there was a lot more the author could have given us. The narrative, at times, was choppy and hard to follow, which resulted in having to re-read passages, pulling you out from the storyline. And the characters were a little underdeveloped. I would have liked to have been forced to become emotionally invested in the characters, but it just wasn\u2019t there for me. What pulled me through was the action and the humor.Regardless, Dead Drunk is a hilarious, fast-paced read that will undoubtedly entertain you (even those of you who don\u2019t normally venture into this genre). And while you may not automatically think of a zombie novel as a beach read, this would be a perfect choice. I think Johnson has tremendous talent. I\u2019m excited to follow his literary journey and watch his undeniable skills grow.FTC Disclaimer: This book was purchased and reviewed outside of the request of the publisher and/or author."}, {"userName": "AudioBookReviewer", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7365795-audiobookreviewer", "userReview": "My full Dead Drunk: Surviving the Zombie Apocalypse.

Yes, this audiobook was that ridiculous, full of crude sophomoric humor, plus enough penis jokes to last me at least the rest of the year. I hate to admit it but I was laughing out loud at times and at others it made me cringe with the overly misogynistic vulgarity. The first half of the story is little more than following a group of juvenile thirty somethings (I think) as they do a typical bachelor bar hopping party. Now these are the people that are rarely mentioned in a zombie apocalypse stories and I think it\u2019s because there isn\u2019t much to the characters, their not the military types or survivalists or individuals with troubled pasts as the typical stars of this genre.
