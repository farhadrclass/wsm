It points out four things that every Christian needs: courage, discipline, vision, and endurance. It also discusses tender love, tough love, sacrificial love, and radical love. I think this is a good book to motivate someone looking to grow in the way he lives out his faith, and as a magnifying glass held over some key character traits that may need to be developed further.UPDATE: After a couple months to reflect on this, the concept of advance decision-making has really stuck with me. When I wait until the last moment to decide how I will act in a certain situation, I often base it on my feelings in that moment, which are often not the best guide; when I decide ahead of time how I will act, it allows me to make the right decision and act correctly and promptly.UPDATE 2: I enjoyed this book just as much on my second reading less than a year later. I have been growing and I see that I'm more in time with some of the teaching now, particularly the challenge to exercise my influence for God's Kingdom."}, {"userName": "Priscilla Krahn", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66186100-priscilla-krahn", "userReview": "This was a great book on building character. I was challenged, motivated, and encouraged to keep on. Bill Hybels style was really easy to read, and very entertaining. I enjoyed his use of real life stories and examples, especially his use of Biblical examples. He covers things like courage, discipline, Christ-like-love, and other traits that we should have in our lives. It was totally worth the time to read."}, {"userName": "Legacy Dad", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/721780-legacy-dad", "userReview": "This book is packed with everything a person needs to be successful in life in just over 100 pages. Hybels shows us and challenges us to maintain our character and values regardless of what society, peers and the media is preaching. Everyone puts on masks in public in order \"look\" a certain way or play a certain part. But the choices we make, no matter how large or small, when no one is looking is what really matters in life. A look at the recent business scandals, political bickering and celebrity infidelities only proves this books message is even more critical now then when it was originally written. I plan to re-read this book yearly and give copies to important people in my life."}, {"userName": "Brian Cambra", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3999755-brian-cambra", "userReview": "This was one of several books assigned to me by a pastor who was mentoring me. Like most books by Bill Hybels, it is short and to the point. I loved it. The character traits that Bill indicates lead to integrity are very important and he succinctly discusses their importance and how we can work at maintaining them. I especially loved that love takes up about 4 chapters of the book. This is a great read."}, {"userName": "Clara Roberts", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1974067-clara-roberts", "userReview": "Hybels list character qualities as courage, discipline, vision, endurance, and love. He devote a chapter to each ot the first four quailities of character. He then devotes five chapters to love. He divides love into tender love, touch love, sacrifical love, radical love and the character of Christ. This is a book I will reread again. I fear that character is what is missing from our life and is so deparately needed. I want to see more character in my life."}, {"userName": "Maui Rochell", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8025692-maui-rochell", "userReview": "This is the first book I bought in CCF Center's bookstore. The title of the book caught my attention and I immediately grabbed it. Who you are when no one is looking is one of the hardest question to answer. Is your integrity still intact? So is your thoughts and actions when you are left with nothing but your thoughts? The book discusses about the common yet hard to practice characters from Courage to Vision and Love. It's a great read with so much to ponder about."}, {"userName": "Hon3yb33", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44099-hon3yb33", "userReview": "This short book is packed with so much depth in every single chapter (I even read some chapters multiples times!).

How do we behave when no one is looking? In that your character is proved- to be consistent even when it doesn't seem to have any importance. Courage, discipline, vision, patience and love...these are very important. Bill Hybels writes for each one a whole chapter. What do we need to do God's will? We need COURAGE to join a family which is misunderstood by the world; we need DISCIPLINE to fulfill the duties set by God for His children; we need VISION to overcome the inevitable problems and see what God does in the lives of His children; we need PATIENCE to keep in touch with brothers and sisters even if it would be easier to go your way; we need LOVE to hold God's family united and to reach to others with the invitation to join the family- not just any love, but tender, tough, sacrificial and radical love. In one word, we need character to do God's will. I liked it very much that Bill Hybels opens and closes the book by stressing the importance of having the character which only Jesus can produce!!!"}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2531400-hannah", "userReview": "I wasn't so sure about this book when I started it, but it really challenged me in some areas that I needed to look at (Courage and Tough Love, particularly), and opened up some really amazing conversations in our small group. It's written very simply, and some parts seem a little pat, but I think that's why it was good to read it with others - we got to talk those parts through, mull them over and give examples of them, and that really made it all come to life.\"Most people who claim they want the character trait of love actually mean that they want to be loved. They hope that people will admire them and treat them with affection. But godly character says the goal is not to be loved but to do the hard work of loving others well instead, and to do so in myriad ways.\""}, {"userName": "Will Siskey", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47413984-will-siskey", "userReview": "This book brought up some good points about what we do in our spare/alone time that effects our character. I feel like this would be good for someone to dip their toes in the water. However, if you're looking for something with more depth to really search your heart then I would suggest opting for Battling Unbelief by John Piper, Crazy Love by Francis Chan and/or maybe even Wild at Heart by John Eldridge."}, {"userName": "Richard Madarang", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42142171-richard-madarang", "userReview": "This book tells a lot about the real struggles and situations of people (Christian or non-Christian) this present age especially on the on the part of the common moral standards of all the society.
