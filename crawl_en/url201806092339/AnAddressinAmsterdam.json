Instead, this is a sort of hybrid between new adult and historical fiction. Rachel Klein is eighteen when the Nazis come marching into Amsterdam. At first, life under occupation is bearable. But as time goes on, more and more restrictions are placed on the Dutch, and Dutch Jews especially. Rachel joins the underground resistance movement, delivering papers and false documents. As the oppression of Jews increase, and people start disappearing, she wants to go into hiding. But her father is a major German appeaser who is convinced the country of his birth would never unfairly target him (you would think Germany revoking all Jews' citizenship would be a clue they no longer considered him German or cared, but apparently not). But when the round ups and deportations get frequent enough even her father can't ignore them anymore, the family goes into hiding, first into a basement and then an attic. At the start of the war, Rachel falls in love with Michel, a resistance member. She couldn't marry him because her parents would never approve of an inter-faith relationship. He has to go into hiding long before she does, and Rachel's life feels empty without him. She wonders if she'll ever find love again, but then Michel's friend Rolf winds up hiding in the same basement as her family, and Rachel finds something to live for again.I actually enjoyed this story, most of it, quite a bit. I'm not a huge fan of historical fiction, but I liked Rachel, was interested in how she dealt with the occupation and joining the resistance, and it was clear the author had done her research. One issue this book touches on that I don't see often is the role of the Jewish Council in the oppression and deportation of their own people. I also thought there was a certain realness to the arguably ungrateful behavior of the Klein family toward their Gentile hiders and the perhaps exploitative behavior of the Gentile in return. We'd like to think that in a time of war, people pull together and put their differences aside, but that's not human nature.The problem with this book that it isn't very well written (I admit I'm picky about this). For some reason, the first half is told entirely through Rachel's perspective, but switches to perspective-by-committee for the second half. That seemed unnecessary. Characters bounced in and out of Rachel's life, which might have been realistic during wartime, but doesn't make for a smooth reading experience. There wasn't great transitioning between scenes or time periods, and the sex scenes in this book are really awkward. Rachel's relationship with Rolf left me cold, and I was pretty surprised that a character portrayed as so smart made such a foolish choice in the end. Which brings me to the ending. Which I hated. What's the point of getting the reader invested in the fate of about dozen characters if we're never going to find out what happens to them?Thank you to the publisher and NetGalley for granting me a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44068050-kate", "userReview": "An Address in Amsterdam is not the typical sort of book I would opt to review, I often find that the stories surrounding WWII difficult to review without a great emotional attachment or feel so lost in the story that I lose track of taking notes and just read the story. Without regurgitating the plot, I will say that this is a poignant and mesmerising story of an eighteen year old woman in Nazi occupied Amsterdam and the struggles faced by her and those around her.The resilience and determination of Rachel Klein makes this such a wonderfully compelling read, joining the underground resistance was a dangerous move for this young woman but she felt that it was something necessary. The shift from the naive young woman to the member of the resistance allows for great character development. Initially slow to begin with, the pace soon picks up and holds the reader's attention throughout. Despite being historical fiction, this reads almost as a tale recounted rather than imagined. There is an attention to detail in the writing that feels accurate to the time setting, it is evident that there has been a lot of research done to ensure this historical accuracy as well as the details of the Dutch resistance. The Dutch resistance was not a subject that I was overly familiar with, most of the books that I have read of this nature seem to focus largely on the events in Germany or France so this was both interesting and informative. Compelling characters and a rich plot make this an enthralling read and one I would have no hesitation to recommend.

The Dutch will certainly stand up for their Jewish citizens against any attempts by the Nazis to discriminate against them.

Rachel starts as a young girl in love and finds herself drawn into the underground, helping to hide Jews from the Nazis at the same time trying to convince her German Jewish father that their own family is in danger.

They were last seen trying to escape over the rooftops as the police shot at them. I felt their presence, and imagined who they might have been and what had brought them there. My heroine, Rachel Klein, and her parents began to come to life, first in faint pencil sketch lines and slowly filling in. I hungered to learn more about their world. Somehow, I had been placed in the midst of it, and it was my obsession and duty to find out what their lives had been like, and what had configured their choices.\u201d Mary Dingee Fillmore, Author, AN ADDRESS IN AMSTERDAM (She Writes Press)Mary Dingee Fillmore, spent thirteen years researching, writing and rewriting AN ADDRESS IN AMSTERDAM, the fictional story of a young Jewish woman, Rachel who joins the underground to fight against the Nazis. The book is also an expression of her love for the city \u2013 its canals, centuries-old houses reflected in the water and so much more. But, as any lover learns, beauties also hold other truths. Eighty percent of its Jewish population was deported and murdered by the Nazis during WWII.After writing AN ADDRESS IN AMSTERDAM, Mary has definitive thoughts about why it was important for her to write this story. \u201cI could well have been a colluder or collaborator, watching my neighbors being rounded up \u2013 or a resister. But it\u2019s also my story because it\u2019s that of everybody who has ever been hated. Each of us has hated, and been hated. The book is about where that hatred can lead, and how one young Jewish woman found the courage to resist. So can we.\u201dVery well shared, especially in these very unsettling times.maryMARY DINGEE FILLMORE\u2019S BACKGROUND: After a lifetime of private creative writing, I was seized by a subject too important to hide in my journal or a letter to friends. Living in a house where Jewish people were hidden inspired my novel, AN ADDRESS IN AMSTERDAM. Since my first lengthy stay in Amsterdam in 2001, I have been visiting, researching, writing, and talking about the Holocaust and resistance in the Netherlands. No, I\u2019m neither Dutch nor Jewish, just a lover of the city of Amsterdam and its people, living and dead. I would have been a neighbor of the deported citizens had I been alive at that time, and I will always wonder whether I would have colluded passively, collaborated, or resisted as I would hope.For more information about Mary Dingee Fillmore, check out her websites at http://www.maryfillmore.com and http://www.seehiddenamsterdam.com"}, {"userName": "Debi Lantzer", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35280639-debi-lantzer", "userReview": "As part of the 2016 BookSparks Fall Reading Challenge (#FRC2016), I received this book, An Address in Amsterdam by Mary Dingee Fillmore. I wasn't quite sure how I felt about reading it; I've never been a fan of historic pieces. This book fell under the course title of Jewish Studies, and the department was - gasp - Historical Fiction..... and so it began.....I actually enjoyed most of this story and the first thing that hit me is that the author really did her homework in providing readers with historical accuracy before writing this book. I felt that the book actually started out a little slow but then moved up and kind of leveled out once I was hooked into Rachel Klein's life. Ms. Fillmore did a great job with the details too, the scenes on the pages were very vivid. An Address in Amsterdam explores the dilemmas of living in Holland during the Nazi Occupation.An Address in Amsterdam shares the story of Jews in Amsterdam from the beginning of the Nazi occupation through the year 1943, at the the height of the deportations and collaboration. Rachel Klein is an 18-year old woman who is very worried about what might happen to her own family in Amsterdam. While Rachel's mother, Rose wanted her family to leave and go to London to stay with an elderly aunt, Rachel's father, Jacob is a dedicated physician and feels that the Dutch will never allow the Nazis to be anything more than just a physical presence in Amsterdam. Rachel is thrown into a horrible atmosphere of suspicion and hate. She sees even more and more hatred and when her lover is forced to leave or face arrest (or worse), Rachel joins the underground movement as a courier. Almost every day for 18 months, Rachel searches for addresses and confronts her fears. An Address in Amsterdam provides a very dramatic story of heroism, courage, and love in the face of adversity.

Thanks to Ms. Fillmore\u2019s in-depth research and skillful storytelling, the reader experiences every triumph and horrifying challenge faced by each character. The most compelling and educational portion of the book for me is when the family is forced to hide in a cellar, and we are not just witnesses to the family\u2019s courage, we see, smell, and fear everything with them. The book is about love and loss, the consequences of denying reality, the systematic ostracizing and killing of innocent Jews, the heroic actions of those who risked their lives to protect Jews, the emotional toll of being a hunted outcast in your own country, and the strength of the human will to live.

Her effort has brought forth a very heart-moving tale of intrigue and heartbreak. The conditions under which the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands took place were an ever-changing daily disintegration. Some foresaw the inevitable and fled the country. Others were swept up in mass arrests, murdered or disappeared into hiding. This book takes you there and places you directly in the midst of an insecure world fueled by irrational anti-Semitism.The author, not a Jew herself, was moved to take action in 2002 after realizing that the home she was staying in while on a pleasure trip to Amsterdam was once inhabited by the family she went on to write about.

The tension builds as she runs small errands, delivering packages and then underground newspapers, and then takes increasing risks as she becomes involved in providing false papers to Jews trying to flee. When her own family finally recognizes the danger they face, she goes into hiding with her parents. The descriptions of the cellar where they must hide in dark, cramped conditions, dependent on their host for scraps of food and the only human contact with the outside world, is so vivid and heart-wrenching.

Rachel sees how Amsterdam is quickly changing and is willing to do whatever she can to protect as many people as possible in An Address in Amsterdam by Mary Dingee Fillmore.For eighteen years, Rachel has been an ideal and dutiful daughter, never causing her parents any worry. Now that Rachel is growing older, she's forming her own opinions and is very concerned about what she sees happening to her Jewish friends and neighbors. She's also very worried about what might happen to her own family in Amsterdam. Rachel's mother Rose wanted the family to leave and go to London and stay with an elderly aunt, but Rachel's father, Jacob a dedicated physician, feels that the Dutch will never allow the Nazis' to more than a physical presence. As Rachel sees more and more hatred aimed at the Jewish population, and her lover Michiel is forced to leave or face arrest or worse, she joins the underground movement as a courier delivering messages, newspapers, and even forged documents. Rachel learns that not all of the Dutch are willing to blindly follow the Nazis and put their lives not to mention the lives of their loved ones on the line by helping to hide and protect Jewish families and other members of the underground movement. When things begin to get really bad in Amsterdam, Rachel talks her parents into hiding, but will it be enough to protect them from the Nazis?I found An Address in Amsterdam to be an engrossing read. The beginning of the story read a bit slow, but after the first 40-50 pages, the story picked up steam and I kept turning page after page just to see what would happen next. Ms. Fillmore provides a dramatic story of acts of heroism, courage, and love in the face of adversity. Rachel comes across as a typical teen at times filled with teen angst and drama, and then she is seen as the unbelievably courageous and heroic woman willing to do what she can in the face of fear and unknown horrors. This is not just the story of one girl and the underground movement, but rather the story of one girl, one family, one love, and the Dutch gentiles working to help and protect Dutch Jews in a time of unspeakable acts of bigotry, hatred, and horrors. It was impossible for this reader to read An Address in Amsterdam and not be touched by the ugliness directed towards the Jewish population. However, Ms. Fillmore has taken a story about a group of people that we know doesn't end well at all and imbued it with a sense of hope that things will get better and that love will help them make it through. Do things end well for Rachel and her family? You'll have to read the story to find out. If you enjoy reading historical fiction then I recommend you grab a copy of An Address in Amsterdam to read."}, {"userName": "Jasmyn", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2940845-jasmyn", "userReview": "I have read quite a few stories about World War II, but most were about events that took place in Germany or England. This was a very different one for me, taking place in Amsterdam. A place where the Jewish population was almost wiped out by the end of WWII. The people of Amsterdam never thought the war would come to them. They had lived peacefully for years and hadn't gotten involved in WWII. They thought it was pass them by.But as we know, it did not just pass them by. Rachel Klein, a young Jewish woman, finds herself caught up in all of it. As she watches the Nazi's take over her city and country, she knows she can't stand by and watch it happen. When her friends and neighbors are hauled away to placed unknown to never be heard from again, she turns from an innocent girl without many cares, into one of the best messengers with the resistance. Putting her life on the line countless times to help fellow Jews and those that support them, the time comes where it's too dangerous for her to continue and she goes into hiding with her family.This was an incredibly uplifting story of how one person can make a difference in other's lives. But it was also an incredibly sad tale of one of the worst times in human history. Well written, and from what I can tell, well researched, An Address in Amsterdam was a chilling look into human nature and history that we should never forget."}, {"userName": "Katherine", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38583027-katherine", "userReview": "What would life be like if you were trapped in a situation where everything was going from difficult to unbearable? In An Address in Amsterdam, Mary Dingee Fillmore deftly explores the characters' gradual realization that the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands was not going to be benign. The main character, teenaged Rachel, grows to realize this in the springtime, when the flowers are beginning to bloom in little gardens throughout the city. This delicately described beauty contrasts starkly with the increasing ugliness of pro-Nazi and anti-Jewish restrictions. The novel placed me in 1940s Amsterdam as if I had actually been there at the time. The menacing atmosphere brings confusion and then fear to Rachel, her school friends, her parents, and the other families. Without giving away more of the plot, I can say that I was rooting for Rachel to help with the resistance while also fearing for her safety. My favorite books are the ones where I become heavily invested in the characters, and this one brings not only the human characters to life, but draws Amsterdam itself in as a character in the drama."}, {"userName": "Lee-Ann", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32911601-lee-ann", "userReview": "I'm going to title my review \"It's not you, it's me\". I couldn't finish this book, and I think it may be because I have read too much WWII historical fiction. I have enjoyed some stellar pieces, and this was not one of them. Not to say it was bad, but it just wasn't for me. The writing was good for the most part (I had a problem with the sex scenes. They were so awkward with descriptions of pulsating vaginas and penis licking...the verbiage was not well thought out). The intent of this novel was there, but it was more of a coming of age story then it was a true journey through the hell of Nazi occupied Europe (I stopped at about 40% through). I like gritty, raw, real emotion in my Historical Fiction, and I think that was lacking here. Most readers who want a gentle intro to WWII Historical Fiction (before diving into something like The Nightingale or All the Light We Cannot See, for instance) may find this a great starting piece. Thank you for the opportunity to read and review this novel!"}], "description": "Rachel Klein hopes she can ignore the Nazis when they roll into Amsterdam in May 1940. She's falling in love, and her city has been the safest place in the world for Jewish people since the Spanish Inquisition. But when Rachel's Gentile boyfriend is forced to disappear rather than face arrest, she realizes that everything is changing, and so must she. Although she is often tired and scared, she delivers papers for the underground under the Nazis noses. But after eighteen months of ever increasing danger, she pushes her parents to go into hiding with her. The dank basement where they take refuge seems like the last place where Rachel would meet a new man but she does. An Address in Amsterdam shows that, even in the most hopeless situation, an ordinary young woman can make the choice to act with courage and even love.", "title": "An Address in Amsterdam", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29331734-an-address-in-amsterdam", "average": 4.14, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1464015895l/29331734.jpg", "reviews": 34, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2379100.Mary_Dingee_Fillmore", "name": "Mary Dingee Fillmore"}], "type": ["Historical", "World War II", "Fiction", "War", "War"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29331734-an-address-in-amsterdam", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32440234-an-address-in-amsterdam", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5494444-women-mbas"]}
