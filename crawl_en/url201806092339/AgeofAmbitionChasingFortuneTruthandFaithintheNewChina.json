Osnos did a good job of weaving together the characters and themes that he explores--built around the triad of fortune, truth and faith--capturing the way that prosperity and development co-exist with political dissent and spiritual exploration.I lived in China from 2007 to 2011 and, like many aspiring Western 'half-pats' in China, learned a great deal about my surrounds from reading the reportage and books of Evan Osnos, Peter Hessler (his predecessor as the New Yorker's Beijing correspondent) and others. Many of us were partly inspired to visit China because of Peter Hessler's \u201cRiver Town\u201d, and a 'Hessler versus Osnos' debate made for common conversation. For those fellow Hessler enthusiasts, you'll find Osnos by comparison in book length to be similar to his longform journalism: more macro-inclined, focused on bigger issues and mover-shaker types, less personal and comical. While I loved reading Hessler on China for all the adventure and insights into the working class he provides, Osnos excels at analyzing the grand themes and intellectual debates that China observers engage in. For those who haven't read Hessler and want a more personal, street-level insight into contemporary China, I suggest the entire trilogy, preferably in chronological order.Osnos does an above-average job of balancing between the biases of various sides: the domestic and Western media, Chinese liberals and conservatives, etc. While his own politics appear clear--he comes across as a pragmatic liberal--he presents competing beliefs, at least beyond the official Party line, in an insightful, unobstructed manner. I would love to hear what more Chinese readers think of the book - I'm sure that translations are/will make their way to the curious."}, {"userName": "thinkingape", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2303273-thinkingape", "userReview": "\u6211\u89c9\u5f97\u8fd9\u672c\u4e66\u66f4\u591a\u662f\u5bf9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u611f\u89c9\u4ece\u8fd9\u91cc\u5f00\u59cb\u4f5c\u8005\u6ca1\u6709\u8d70\u66f4\u8fdc\uff0c\u6211\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u662f\u4e0d\u662f\u4ed6\u523b\u610f\u800c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u4ed6\u5bf9\u8fd9\u672c\u4e66\u7684\u671f\u671b\u5c31\u662f\u4ecb\u7ecd\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u53d1\u8868\u81ea\u5df1\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7ed9\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u3002\u8fd8\u662f\u4f9d\u7136\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u6587\u5316\u7684\u9694\u9602\uff0c\u4ed6\u52aa\u529b\u5374\u65e0\u6cd5\u53d1\u5c55\u51fa\u66f4\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u60f3\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e5f\u8bb8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e2d\u56fd\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u6240\u4ee5\u4ed6\u9009\u62e9\u806a\u660e\u7684\u4fdd\u6301\u6c89\u9ed8\u548c\u65c1\u89c2\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5c55\u73b0\u4e00\u79cd\u9884\u8a00\u5bb6\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u3002\u4f46\u662f\u5176\u4e2d\u5f88\u591a\u8c08\u8bba\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u52a0\u6df1\u523b\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u8150\u8d25\uff0c\u8d2b\u5bcc\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5ba1\u67e5\u5236\u5ea6\u3002"}, {"userName": "Wei Liu", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27401249-wei-liu", "userReview": "Disappointed.

As China is a constantly changing country, I'm sometimes frustrated by how quickly outdated books become. However, if I had to recommend one book to a person, who is interested to learn about contemporary China, I think Osnos' Age of Ambition is the perfect recommendation. He hits the nail about the Party and the stories he collected from the people he interviewed are a realistic reflection of what is happening in China right now. He did a wonderful job weaving the stories together and I thought it was brilliant how he managed to divide the books into three themes; fortune, truth and faith. I'm not going to write more about the characters he interviewed, do yourself a favor and read about them yourselves!Favorite quotes:The longer I lived in China, the more it seemed that people had come to see the economic boom as a train with a limited number of seats. For those who found a seat - because they arrived early, they had the right family, they paid the right bribe - progress was beyond their imagination. Everyone else could run as far and fast as their legs would carry them, but they would only be able to watch the caboose shrink into the distance.In its abuses and deceptions, the Chinese government was failing to make a persuasive argument for what it meant to be Chinese in the modern world. The Party had rested its legitimacy on prosperity, stability, and a pantheon of hollow heroes. In doing so, it had disarmed itself in the battle for the soul, and it sent Chinese individuals out to wander the market of ideas in search of icons of their own."}, {"userName": "Trish", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish", "userReview": "I don\u2019t think anyone could argue that Evan Osnos wasn\u2019t ambitious in this, his National Book Award-winning compendium of current Chinese political culture. Subtitled Chasing Fortune, Truth and Faith in the New China, this book extends and expands essays he\u2019d already published in The New Yorker magazine and gives outsiders a glimpse into the confusion and mad, exciting reality that is China today.Osnos covers a lot of ground and at the risk of appearing to be a ping-pong ball in the hands of a giant, he patiently and persistently over a period of years pursues big questions about what China culture is and is becoming. We can extrapolate from his work to consider what change in China means to us around the world. I admit to exhaustion when contemplating China\u2019s development because of its overwhelmingly big, populous, and uncontrollable aspects. But one thing is sure: ordinary Chinese people have a kind of \u201cget ahead\u201d entrepreneurial mentality that swamps the vitality of ordinary American life. The distance from their basic living starting point and ours is so great that their desperate energy is going to be the propulsion for societies around the globe. We can\u2019t keep pace but we can gain in their slipstream.Osnos makes reporting in China look easy even when it clearly is not, even now. The state has loosened its grip a little but there is still the possibility of community or state backlash on individuals that speak to him openly. Those people are courageous souls. Osnos managed to corral the size and scope of his story to a manageable level and yet was able to give us an idea of the great energy being unleashed among the populace and the Chinese government\u2019s pride and fear. I am currently reading about the North Korean regime in Pyongyang (A Kim Jong-Il Production: The Extraordinary True Story of a Kidnapped Filmmaker, His Star Actress, and a Young Dictator's Rise to Power by Paul Fischer) and so the Chinese government looks far less effective and controlling by comparison. But the richness of Osnos\u2019s life in China comes through. I especially liked the reportage in the Epilogue that shows from several long term studies over two decades \"no evidence that the Chinese people are, on average, any happier. If anything, they are less satisfied than in 1990, and the burden of decreasing satisfaction has fallen hardest on the bottom third of the population in wealth. Satisfaction among Chinese in even the upper third has risen only moderately.\" Overall, they found, \"economic growth is not enough; job security and a social safety net are also crtitical to people's happiness.\" Ah. Well, both Chinese and American officials could learn something from this. This book won the 2014 National Book Award for Nonfiction."}, {"userName": "Mal Warwick", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick", "userReview": "Age of Ambition won the National Book Award for Nonfiction in 2014, and no wonder. Nothing I\u2019ve read about the rise of China for many years has immersed me so deeply into the texture of life in that country or more memorably portrayed its yawning contradictions.Twenty years ago, the extraordinary husband-and-wife reporting team of Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn published China Wakes: The Struggle for the Soul of a Rising Power. Based on five years of work in China \u2014 they won the Pulitzer for their reporting on the Tiananmen Square massacre \u2014 China Wakes introduced American readers to the dynamism and the clashing contradictions unleashed a decade and a half earlier by the economic reforms of Deng Xiaoping. Now, two decades further on, Evan Osnos ably updates the story with Age of Ambition.Osnos brings to bear the insight that comes only with extended experience and facility with the language in an alien culture, the sort of understanding that no reader can glean from the daily news, no matter how deeply reported. \u201cThe Party had always prided itself on articulating the \u2018central melody\u2019 of Chinese life,\u201d Osnos writes, in a perfect example of this insight, \u201cbut as the years passed, the Party\u2019s rendition of that melody seemed increasingly out of tune with the cacophony and improvisation striking up all around it. It was impossible to know what \u2018most Chinese\u2019 believed because the state media and the political system were designed not to amplify public opinion but to impose a shape on it. Nationalism, like any other note in the melody, might surge to the surface at one moment and fade into the background at another, but was it the mainstream view? The nationalists didn\u2019t think so.\u201dOsnos focuses his penetrating repertorial eye on ten or a dozen central figures whose stories resume from time to time through the pages of this brilliant survey of contemporary China. A heroic young captain in the Taiwanese Army who defects to the Mainland and later \u2014 much later \u2014 becomes one of the country\u2019s most celebrated economists, garnering the job of chief economist at the World Bank. A self-promoting English teacher who builds a nationwide adult education empire based on urging his students to shout English at the top of their lungs. A Ph.D. candidate in philosophy at a leading university who spearheads an ultranationalist campaign online. The sad story of the driven railroad man who rises to preside over one of the most corrupt ministries in a country of legendary corruption, building China\u2019s network of high-speed trains along the way \u2014 and is nearly executed for his achievements. These and so many other fascinating characters bring the reality of present-day China to life in ways that episodic journalistic reports so rarely can. Evan Osnos knows his subjects, and he follows them for years. Read Age of Ambition, and you\u2019ll get to know them, too.Still shy of 40, Evan Osnos reported from China for The New Yorker from 2008 to 2013. Earlier, as a correspondent for the Chicago Tribune, he was part of a team that won the Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting. Age of Ambition is his first book."}, {"userName": "Miles", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7208369-miles", "userReview": "Evan Osnos\u2019s Age of Ambition is packed with detailed observations and curious facts that will edify anyone looking to learn about modern China\u2019s domestic structure and growing role on the international stage. Osnos is a talented writer whose style can be described as \u201chumanist nonfiction\u201d\u2013\u2013a series of interview-based narratives organized by theme and supported by ancillary research. It reminds of me George Packer\u2019s exceptional book The Unwinding: An Inner History of the New America, which is having a new moment in post-election America. As with all good nonfiction, Age of Ambition complicates the world and asks more questions than it answers. The following passages give a good sense of Osnos\u2019s general approach:\"The hardest part about writing from China was not navigating the authoritarian bureaucracy or the occasional stint in a police station. It was the problem of proportions. How much of the drama was light and how much was dark? How much was about opportunity and how much was about repression? From far away it was difficult for outsiders to judge, but I found that up close it wasn\u2019t much easier, because it depended on where you were looking.\" (227)\"Anybody who scratched beneath the surface of Chinese life discovered a more complicated conception of the good life that had made room for the pursuit of values and dignity alongside the pursuit of cars and apartments.\" (371)Age of Ambition is broken into three parts: Fortune, Truth, and Faith. Osnos provides solid commentary on each theme, weaving the stories of his interviewees into each section with impressive fluidity. Osnos\u2019s cast of characters is broad and diverse; it includes a Taiwanese military man who defected to China, a female media mogul, Ai Weiwei (the internationally-acclaimed artist), a young conservative nationalist with training in Western philosophy, a young man obsessed with mastering the English language, a blind lawyer put under house arrest for questioning the government, and more.Each tale adds its own spice to Age of Ambition, but as an American, I became enthralled by the myriad ways contemporary China has imitated the United States while also working very hard to set itself apart from all of Western culture. For example, when fledgling Party propagandists wanted to learn the tricks of the trade, they looked to America, \u201cthe holy land of public relations\u201d (118). China rapidly adapted a distinctly American tool to bolster a distinctly anti-American (or at least anti-democratic) government. This dynamic comes up again and again in Age of Ambition, with Chinese individuals constantly negotiating with a cultural attitude toward America that appears admiring, supercilious, aspirational, jealous, and spiteful all at once.Osnos dives deeply into the question of how China\u2019s modernization has affected Chinese identity. He identifies a \u201cparadox of ambition\u201d stemming from the fundamental contraction of an authoritarian state overseeing a booming private sector: \u201cThe Party was sparking individual ambition and self-creation in one half of life and suppressing those tendencies in the other\u201d (150). Referring to the lasting impact of China\u2019s disastrous Cultural Revolution, one of Osnos\u2019s subjects asserts: \u201cWe cast aside our three core ideas\u2013\u2013Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism\u2013\u2013and that was a mistake\u201d (107-8). A toxic form of Marxism quickly filled the void, and then was injected with rampant capitalism as China \u201copened up\u201d to a larger role in international trade. But, as Osnos points out, capitalism is an economic system, and not a particularly effective means of generating or maintaining cultural identity:\"In its abuses and deceptions, the Chinese government was failing to make a persuasive argument for what it meant to be Chinese in the modern world. The Party had rested its legitimacy on prosperity, stability, and a pantheon of hollow heroes. In doing so, it had disarmed itself in the battle for the soul, and it sent Chinese individuals out to wander the market of ideas in search of icons of their own.\" (306)The icons that have come to dominate this rootless landscape are familiar to anyone with a passing interest in world affairs: opulent displays of wealth, crony capitalism, vulgar and insipid media, blind consumerism, and growing socioeconomic inequality. As in America, \u201cChina\u2019s new fortunes were wildly out of balance\u201d (267). The nature and scope of Chinese corruption seems to have a flavor all its own, but its underpinnings are present throughout the globalized world. Osnos reflects on this situation with an image that applies as easily to any struggling Western democracy as it does to modern China:\"The longer I lived in China, the more it seemed that people had come to see the economic boom as a train with a limited number of seats. For those who found a seat\u2013\u2013because they arrived early, they had the right family, they paid the right bribe\u2013\u2013progress was beyond their imagination. Everyone else could run as far and fast as their legs would carry them, but they would only be able to watch the caboose shrink into the distance.\" (271)So what to make of all this? For me, Age of Ambition inspired fear and admiration in about equal measure. I read the book because a dear friend of mine recently lived in China for a time, and came away from the experience distressed by what he saw as a deeply repressive and increasingly aggressive nation with a huge and needy population. Without the chance to make that judgment for myself, I must admit that I\u2019m far more fearful of the new government in my homeland than one far across the Pacific, at least for the moment. And then the sadness really sinks in, because fear is perhaps the only emotion currently shared by everyone alive on Earth\u2013\u2013the commonplace tragedy that unites and divides us.As the reasons for informed cynicism continue to mount, I take solace in the knowledge that thinkers like Osnos will continue to provide us with exemplary texts to improve our minds and defend civilization from its worst self.This review was originally published on my blog, words&dirt."}, {"userName": "Dan McGrady", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/812488-dan-mcgrady", "userReview": "This is the best book I've read so far on China. It helps you understand the odd dichotomy of big government and free market capitalism that exists there. Something that the vast majority of westerns including myself fail to really understand. That is not a simple topic to summarize but the author presented it - not as a rigid historical background - but as a mix of stories, biographies, of real fascinating people in China. Combining many of the articles the author has written for the New Yorker on China.It explains not only how the government got to it's current state but also why it's not going away anytime soon. The book demonstrated that a surprising amount of people in China are still embracing it; seeing it as necessary and helpful to their advancement in the world. And are critical and resistant to the flawed western democracies they see on TV.The author expertly avoided bias from his presentation of the situation and I should note it is hardly a defense or criticism of the Party or its supporters.One unexpected result of reading this book was how it gave me a greater critical eye just not at China - but of our western countries due to the outside perspective provided by the young and old Chinese people he interviewed. Through the book you discover how common a perspective it is among the Chinese that even though Americans are highly critical of China's government, anyone with a critical eye can see that the American government is extremely similar to China's over-bearing state in many ways. One example is how the US gov touches every market and industry, not just at home but globally and loves over-policing and militarization. So ultimately you must credit China for having at least one thing going for it: their government is honest about their oppression. They just may not be as good at obscuring it as other countries.I can't stop talking about this book among my friends.

Documents the cultural changes of a country in great flux, and tells the story of national changes through individual narratives. I was especially taken with the stories of educated young Chinese nationalists, reviving traditional Eastern thought and insisting on a unique place for China in the world aloof from blind Westernization. This was interesting in the suggestion that \"Third Worldism\" is still an animating force for many Chinese behind the market-driven consumerism projected to the outside world.One of my favourite subjects is the upheaval of China's Cultural Revolution during Mao's time, and while this is very much a book about the present moment those events still reverberate. Chinese history and culture was mostly wiped clean, and people are only beginning to try and rediscover it. Moreover they are being forced to develop a new morality to cope with their present moment, and to fill the \"spiritual void\" created by the national ideology of production and consumption mixed with (obviously discredited) paeans to socialism.Well-written, even humorous at times, offers a good window into the hopes and aspirations of contemporary Chinese people - especially young strivers who are wholly a product of this age."}, {"userName": "Scott", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1449138-scott", "userReview": "Evan Osnos lived in China, specifically Beijing, from 2008 to 2013, covering the enormous changes in that nation as it embraces it own brand of capitalism (and the enormous implications, local and global, of those changes) for the New Yorker. I hadn't read any of Osnos's pieces for the magazine before picking up Age of Ambition, which just won this year's National Book Award, but I imagine much of this lengthy, impressively-reported portrait falls within the previously published category. Or, at least, it feels that way, like a bunch of strung-together long-forms, each meandering in standard New Yorker fashion, but to me never quite cohering into a book. Not that there aren't plenty of interesting and engaging moments here, as well as keen insights sharpened still further from his years spent on the ground, talking to an astonishing array of people who embody the \"new China\" where, as you can tell from the book's title, ambition reigns supreme, with all of the good (hundred of millions of people actually have plenty to eat these days) and the bad (government repression of speech, vast income gap, spiritual and ethical bankruptcy, country- (and planet-) wide environmental nightmare) that comes with that dubious distinction. For example, the many riffs on censorship were fascinating, I thought, how the Party has had to become so open and unashamed in the internet-age about what you can and cannot ask, write about, search for, photograph. Foreign journos like Osnos receive daily texts on what's newly off-limits, and the Propaganda Bureau constantly updates its list of blocked search terms, driven by the events of the day and the code phrases used by crafty bloggers to get around the restrictions. Also notable is how rapidly rampant capitalism, China-style, has destroyed whatever soul the country may have had, as people are willing to accept almost anything, including corruption on a mind-boggling scale, as long as they feel like they are \"getting theirs\". But while the big-picture stuff was all pretty great, many of the stories Osnos tells to get us there feel a little stale, like years-old news but told with a weekly-magazine immediacy. The best (worst) example of this are the long Ai Weiwei chapters, which feel lifted straight from the pages of 2011 or whatever, adding no perspective to the often-told (for example, in the great documentary Never Sorry, or even at the recent Brooklyn Museum exhibition) tale. And there are other things like that, about much less famous people, lengthy profiles that no longer feel particularly relevant to \"Beijing today\", nor important enough to warrant inclusion in history. If you want an overview of China of the last decade, Age of Ambition is a solid choice. Beijing Welcomes You, by Tom Socca, on the city's transformation for the recent Olympics (often with devastating results) is also good."}, {"userName": "Gary", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary", "userReview": "The last ten years of China is told by mostly telling the stories through second person accounts of people the author has interviewed. He tells the story with three different perspectives at play, China's phenomena growth, the corruption and intimidation the government uses, and the third perspective of what the author refers to as faith, by that he means a belief in tradition and a distrust in the system working fairly for the individual.At first, I thought the author was giving too many second person accounts, but then I started to realize he really did have a central overriding narrative tying all the stories together in a cohesive whole. The concept of freethinking never seems to enter in his stories. Respect for authority and tradition usually seems to permeate all the stories.The book does seem very up to date and it seems that China (as represented by its Politburo) is trying to transition from an autocracy to an aristocracy. They are doing everything in their power to shut down free speech on the internet (e.g. banning the search on the word \"The Truth\"), sometimes their corrupt official defense is \"they were sisters not twins\", and a young child can grow up saying \"I want to become a corrupt official\".The second volume of \"Political Order and Political Decay\" made me realize how different China is from the rest of the world and how little I knew about what was going on today in China. I would recommend reading Fukuyama's book before reading this one.The book does a lot in bringing me up to speed on where China is today.

Instead, Age of Ambition explores three themes: economic changes; censorship; and personal values and ethics. Drawing on Osnos' eight years as a reporter based in China, the book follows a loosely chronological path, and the author does an amazing job weaving his themes around a score of characters - real people he got to know from different walks of life. Although I've read other books about China, almost eveything here was somewhat new, or took events I'd heard about in the news and fit them into a much more comprehensible context. At one point, Osnos wrestles with his choice to give so much space to a relatively small number of dissidents in the middle section of the book. On the other hand, as he points out, the question of how the Party will adapt to increasing public pressure to allow freer expression - and how it will get a handle on rampant corruption - is of vital importance to the nation's future. The most disturbing part of Osnos' story is the degree to which the Party really is committed to tight control of ideas, news coverage, and public debate. This book is particularly good at conveying what it feels like for a variety of critics to operate under that scrutiny, and the personal and professional prices they are forced to pay. Topics that receive mention but relatively little discussion include China's environment; status of minority peoples; the colonization of western China and Tibet; China's foreign policy. But there are other good books on each of these issues, and Age of Ambition offers superb insight into the themes it focuses on."}, {"userName": "Menno Vis", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69674953-menno-vis", "userReview": "Great insight in the recent hiatory of China.

It appears to be a collection of stories that originally appeared elsewhere. The general themes consider the promise and reality of China in the new millenium and more broadly since the institution of market reforms in 1978. The result is a well written and fascinating view of China that should be required reading for those seeking to visit China and work there. The picture that emerges in these chapters is a country that is more capitalist and competitive than the US even as the country remains controlled by a totalitarian bureaucratic state. While growth has been unprecedented - even in the West during the industrial revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries - the society is also chaotic and highly corrupt, with the result that problems of justice and equality are increasing as economic inequality in China expands beyond all expectations. High growth and corruption seem to signal an upcoming bursting of the growth bubble and questions about what society will be like when the bubble bursts. There are lots of fascinating chapters, including those on the spread of religious belief in the new China. Another fascinating chapter was the one in which the author joined a Chinese tour group going on a package tour around Europe. The author also does a good job at profiling dissidents, as well as the problems with rapid infrastructure growth - such as the crash of two bullet trains in 2011.

But for Americans who are trying to understand China today, this book provides quite a few fair reflections: Foxconn suicides aren't all about \"sweatshop\" labor, in studies of Chinese people and anecdotes of Macao casinos Chinese people seem to gamble and take risks a lot more than Americans, public censors/50 cent party/propoganda is even worse than most Americans might realize (but it doesn't quite fool a public probably best described as apathetic), and the Internet is ubiquitous. I also liked the three narratives of fortune, truth, and faith that the book follows.Ive heard challenges against specific judgements by Osnos, such as Han Han. He also admits to the difficulty of choosing between producing content on people in the spotlight: rowdy dissidents, rich business owners, Bo Xilai and the everyday lives of the Chinese. Mostly he focuses on the former in this book, and as evident by the proportions of his stories, public dissidents much more willingly divulge their lives and thoughts than government censors (or even everyday Chinese people), so it might leave out other understandings such as family structures and support, differences in the regions of China, the plight of hukou.Still for anyone trying to develop an intuition of China, this is a great book to read!"}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1657830-jim", "userReview": "Age of Ambition by Evan Osnos is one of the most recommended nonfiction books of 2014, and now I understand why. The book chronicles the lives of many people Osnos met while living in China from 2005-2013, from the famous to the not-so-famous, from the very rich to the very poor. What fascinated me most was how the one-party system worked in China, which tried to control everything, yet encouraged its people to prosper and even get rich. I think my favorite person Osnos profiled was Gong Hainan, a woman who founded a successful online dating site and got very wealthy. They take online dating far more seriously in China, where people are much more picky about making a good match. One woman had a very long list of traits for her husband to be, including that he already had more than two, but less than four, serious girlfriends. But the last person Osnos interviews, Qi Xiangfu, a street sweeper, was very moving. Qi knew people looked down on him, yet he had created a rich life on the Internet as a poet, even a good one that was recognized as Super King of Chinese couplets. It was almost as if Osnos had ran into a modern day Walt Whitman or Henry David Thoreau living in Beijing.Age of Ambition is an excellent book to see how the other side of the world lives."}, {"userName": "Ross", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2209582-ross", "userReview": "This book about modern China is both informative and entertaining. Mostly through the stories of many Chinese citizens he documents the tensions that exist is what is now a fascist totalitarian police state. The levels and extent of corruption is staggering. One example was wonderfully creative. The bureaucrats of the agency to enforce the one child policy law who seized the extra babies sold them abroad to adoption agencies. Their bosses had them prosecuted when they found the proceeds had not been shared with them.At the close of the book the author gives a thoughtful discussion of how China's future will go relative to the Communist Party leaders control of power versus freedom for the people. The leaders are now essentially an hereditary aristocracy passing on control to their own children. The control question is interesting given the current demonstrations today (October 2014) in Hong Cong asking for democratic elections.

When a bearded man lost his freedom you said it has nothing to do with me because I am not bearded. When a man who sold sunflower seeds lost his freedom you said it has nothing to do with me because I don\u2019t sell sunflower seeds. But when they come for the skinny, beardless ones who never sold sunflower seeds, there will be nobody left to speak up for you. p. 223There is an expression in Chinese when you take too great a leap, you can tear your balls. p. 238They found that in developing countries parents education was the most decisive factor in determining how much a child would earn someday.

It brings across in big and small ways how quickly and dramatically the world's largest country is changing. Osnos is a New Yorker writer who lived in China for almost a decade, and he has a great feel for the country. There are excellent chapters on corruption, dating, the media, censorship, learning English, and commercialism. He shows how many Chinese people have achieved material wealth but are still looking for meaning, equality, and a chance for individual expression. Osnos is wise enough to avoid making predictions about what might happen in China's near future, but his work does suggest that an economic slowdown could jeopardize the unofficial contract between the Communist Party and its people in which the Party offers prosperity in exchange for political obedience. I wasn't grabbed by every chapter (I though a little too much time went to the stories of dissidents), but overall I got an excellent snapshot of this country that really makes me want to go visit.

I didn't come much closer to understanding it until I read Age of Ambition.This book was remarkable because it was both historically enlightening and personally meaningful. It shed light on corruption in politics, crackdowns on dissidents, the rise of cities and railways, and large-scale migrations towards the cities. It also takes deeply personal routes at times, introducing the reader to people who built media empires that later fell out of favour with the government and aspiring English masters alike.

What we don't see is how both powerful and ordinary people are remaking their lives as their country dramatically changes. As the Beijing correspondent for The New Yorker, Evan Osnos was on the ground in China for years, witness to profound political, economic, and cultural upheaval. In Age of Ambition, he describes the greatest collision taking place in that country: the clash between the rise of the individual and the Communist Party's struggle to retain control. He asks probing questions: Why does a government with more success lifting people from poverty than any civilization in history choose to put strict restraints on freedom of expression? Why do millions of young Chinese professionals-fluent in English and devoted to Western pop culture-consider themselves \"angry youth,\" dedicated to resisting the West's influence? How are Chinese from all strata finding meaning after two decades of the relentless pursuit of wealth?
