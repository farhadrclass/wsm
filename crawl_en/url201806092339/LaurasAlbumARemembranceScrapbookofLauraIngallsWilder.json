I really liked how all the pictures that were shown of the member\u2019s of Laura\u2019s family growing up. I didn\u2019t like the fact that the book didn\u2019t really have any new information about Laura Ingalls Wilder and her childhood. I could have read the whole LIttle House on the Prairie book series and learned as much information from the book. Another aspect of the book that I didn\u2019t really like was the way the book treated the Native Americans the same way the Little House in the Prairie treats Native Americans. The way the Native Americans are treated in the Little House in the Prairie series as brutish and enemies. Even though the Native Americans were there first in the land that the white settlers settled, Native Americans are treated as if they don\u2019t exist. The Little House in the Prairie series has been criticized for the treatment of Native Americans, yet this continues to prompt the philosophy that the land was for the white settlers to take in this book about Laura Ingalls Wilder\u2019s life. I do agree their our aspects that the Little House on the Prairie has such as the closeness to nature and the value of family, but the author of Laura's Album chose to further the myth that of frontierism. I would have given at least a page to talk about the wrongs that have been done in the Little House on the Prairie series. I did like the aspects that talked about Laura\u2019s later life, such as writing her books and moving to the Ozarks. I would give this book a three out of three stars for not addressing the Native American issue. I would recommend this book to children who are reading the Little House on the Prairie series to read Laura\u2019s Album if they want a new perspective on Laura Ingall Wilder\u2019s life."}, {"userName": "L Frost", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24880520-l-frost", "userReview": "This is primarily a collection of photographs and collected items from Laura Ingalls Wilder.

Although, I suppose that was the point of the book. It wasn't meant to detail the lives of Laura, Manly and Rose, but literally 'show' readers though photographs and memorabilia what life was like back in the day. Having read a few of the more detailed accounts of the relationship began Rose and her mother, the superficiality of this one bothers me a bit, as it borders on disingenuous. Maybe really meant for children?"}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5817622-rachel", "userReview": "This is a splendid introductory biography for anyone interested in Laura Ingalls Wilder & her family. The scrapbook layout draws the reader in to examine rare photographs, correspondence, telegrams, textiles & a myriad of other objects that were meaningful in Wilder's life and/or mentioned in her famous autobiographical fictional novels. For example, examples of birthday cards from kids upon her last birthday, two pictures drawn by her pa (Charles) for them when they were children, her first teaching certificate & a young handsome photo of Almanzo (when he first met her) flesh out her world beyond the words.I had the pleasure of meeting the author when I purchased this book, an expert on Laura Ingalls Wilder. An included introduction and chronology helps fill in some gaps some people commented on in additional reviews on GoodReads. For example, I noted someone asked what happened to Rose's husband and the chronology states they divorced eight years after marriage. The information is in the book, and Anderson has other biographies for older readers that provides more details. Many people don't take the time to check out the appendices and I presume Anderson didn't include every detail in order to stay true to his main topic: Laura Ingalls Wilder. Extraneous information was, however, briefly listed in the chronology and readers can always pursue other biographies for additional information.As a librarian, I highly recommend this book for elementary school libraries, public libraries & wherever there is an interest in Wilder's books. This is a genuine delight to read for fans of her works, for Anderson clearly has knowledge of her stories and includes information beyond just the facts of her life. He understands that readers will have a natural interest in her family if they love her stories, so he satisfies that craving while honoring her life and work. It is a great introduction and fans will love it.Perhaps the coolest thing I learned about Mrs. Wilder was that she responded to every fan letter - handwritten, of course. She was popular in her lifetime and at times received over 1,000 letters a year. Amazing. I also would have been thrilled if that young Almanzo picked me up for a buggy ride after teaching. No wonder she called him Manly!"}, {"userName": "Charlotte", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/427149-charlotte", "userReview": "As a fan of the \"Little House\" books (I must have read them four or five times as a kid), I really enjoyed this \"scrapbook\" of photographs, letters, and personal memorabilia of the Ingalls and Wilder families. I particularly enjoyed the photos, as the images in the original books were drawings--I had never seen what any of the Ingallses actually looked like! I also enjoyed the family history information. The \"Little House\" accounts were based on facts but fictionalized in certain ways, so it was fun to compare the real story to what I remembered from the books. \"Laura's Album\" is written for children, so the writing style is simple and lacks detail. This is not really a criticism as I am not the intended audience, but I found myself wanting to know a lot more. What happened to Rose Wilder's husband? What was the story behind getting \"The First Four Years\" published after Laura's death? Were there any outright fabrications in the books, and did this cause any controversy? I suppose I shall have to read a real biography to find out! In any case, \"Laura's Album\" brought back some very fond memories of reading the \"Little House\" books and taught me a bit more about this remarkable American family."}, {"userName": "Tirzah", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7054440-tirzah", "userReview": "I have been listening to the Little House books on audio book and am slightly obsessed with all things Laura at present. So when I stumbled across this juvenile biography filled with pictures and memoirs, I was excited. It is written for children, but I still gleaned new information from it. Some of the pictures you can see online (I know because I was Googling real-life pictures of the Ingalls and Wilders a few days ago - as I said, slightly obsessed!), yet there are quite a few I had never seen. Some other items included are family letters, Pa's obituary, and some other short stories Laura wrote for the paper. The book divides Laura's life by decades and at the end, there is a timeline. Some of the dates confused me as the timeline and narrative contradicted each other, so I am not sure what happened there. I highly recommend to any Little House fan and history buffs. I also recommend to teachers to show their students. Laura and so many other people worked hard to make America what it is today. Her life deserves to be read by today's generation and future ones to come.*I plan on visiting the Wilder home and museum sometime in the near future!*"}, {"userName": "Madeline", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1060786-madeline", "userReview": "An invaluable volume of countless mementos of Laura's life. This beautiful book is filled with letters, photographs, drawings, newspaper articles, and other memorabilia that Laura had saved. I cannot accurately describe here how amazing all of these are to see.The text, separated into chapters by years, first introduces the Ingalls and Quiner-Holbrook families, then transitions into an overview of Laura's lifetime. The text hits all of the main points and was very fun to read. (I'm not sure if anyone else would describe the text as \"fun,\" but I loved reading it, and it was informative, but not dry or boring; I guess that qualifies as \"fun\" to me.) I think it is specifically great for those who have not recently read the Little House books. Of course, this book covers life after Laura's marriage to Almanzo as well, so there is new information for everyone and not just the same stuff in the books.As a practically lifelong Little House fan, I enjoyed this book immensely.

I knew her daughter had become a journalist but I didn't realize just how involved in the literary world both Laura and her daughter were. Not to mention her sister Carrie.
