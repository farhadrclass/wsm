It's a family made up of parents Hattie and Able, who are now in their late 80s, and their 5 middle-aged children. There is the normal squabbling that takes place in families over things like who is the favorite and remembered slights from childhood but this family's problems are even deeper due to drugs, alcohol and divorces. The mother definitely plays favorites and is a real enabler for her youngest son Billy. something that her husband and the rest of the children resent. As the patriarch of the family gets sicker, all of the family problems bubble to the surface to be dealt with once again.This book looks deeply into what makes families work.

Peery\u2019s debut \u201cAlligator Dance: Stories\u201d (1998) remains in print, this is her fourth book.The Campbell\u2019s lived in Amicus, Kansas. The patriarch of the family, an elderly retired judge/attorney Abel Campbell was a WWII veteran that served in Saipan. With a quick and brilliant mind, he studied science and physics. He was a \u201cman\u2019s man\u201d an outdoorsman that enjoyed hunting/fishing. Abel, a perfectionist, had high exact standards for behavior and was profoundly disappointed in his baby boom generation adult children who had brought shame to their once respected family name he had worked diligently to preserve. Often, from the bench and with other connections, his family members had to be excused from legal charges and violations.Hattie, married for over sixty years to Abel had tried to shield her children from their father\u2019s scathing wrath and judgment. As a daughter of pioneers, she was thoughtful and kind serving her community through church and civic duties. With all the scandals involving her adult children\u2019s multiple divorces, public intoxication, DUI\u2019s, drug/alcohol related embarrassing public confrontations, firearms violations, foreclosures, and family estrangement when \u201cfamily problems\u201d were brought to light-- Hattie was deeply troubled over these issues. In her late 80\u2019s with a heart condition, she prayed that she would outlive her youngest son Billy, who was often unable to pay his rent or buy groceries.The oldest daughter \u201cDoro\u201d (Theodora) had relocated to the east coast, and had successfully raised two daughters as a single parent. Smart and literary minded, she loved poetry and literature, wrote Western novels under a pen-name, and had a great job working at a college in her community. Doro's siblings viewed her as a goody two shoes and know it all, so she had to watch her critical opinions of her siblings carefully. Doro returned to Kanas with greater frequency to help with her elderly parents increasing hospitalizations and health issues, and additional alarming family problems.Jesse: the oldest son since their brother Nick had passed away. Nick's premature death was due to a genetic heart condition combined with sepsis, and not his heroin addiction. Jesse, a brooding moody man had tried to keep his alcohol consumption under control. His family didn\u2019t approve of his renting a room in his house to Patsy Gaddy, a floosy who had broken his heart numerous times.Gideon: A menacing darkness in his character caused others to avoid him. His sister called him the \u201cUni-Bomber\u201d. Still, he was thoughtful and concerned about his family, and sincerely tried to help. He usually carried a flask of alcohol tucked inside his coat pocket.ClairBell: Fiercely devoted to her parents, opinionated, obnoxious, judgmental, and very jealous of anyone who had the slightest advantage over her, real or imagined. The large amount of pills she took were prescribed by a doctor. ClairBell spent most of her days on her couch, affected by a variety of ailments; she loved bingo, blackjack, and yard sales, and never hesitated too loudly voice her thoughts and ideas.Billy: The youngest 40-something, at one time or another, had ingested every illegal substance known to man. He was a confident happy-go-lucky flamboyant gay man, and used his charm and colorful personality to get the money he needed to buy drugs. Everyone loved him, and likely felt sorry for him because of his HIV status, his life prolonged for decades by AZT drug therapy. Billy's siblings were most anxious to get him admitted to a rehab facility.This novel was never meant to be a pleasant feel good type story. Rather, the focus is on addictive behavior patterns: such as co-dependency, enabling, control and manipulation, scapegoating, lying and other problems that impact families with substance and alcohol related issues. The Campbell\u2019s needed to unite as a family\u2014set aside differences, and deal constructively with themselves and each other, as this expertly developed storyline evolved and boldly moved to a realistic and unforgettable conclusion. **With thanks and appreciation to St. Martin\u2019s Press via NetGalley for the direct e-copy for the purpose of review."}, {"userName": "Donna Davis", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11510694-donna-davis", "userReview": "The place is Amicus, Kansas; the Campbell family has come together to celebrate the birthday of their frail, ancient patriarch, Abel. Ultimately, though, their attention is drawn, unavoidably, to the youngest among them. Billy is a walking pharmacy, but he won\u2019t be walking anywhere for much longer if something isn\u2019t done. I read this book free and early thanks to Net Galley and St. Martin\u2019s Press. If I had paid full retail price, it would have been worth every red cent. It had me at hello, and performed a miracle of sorts by rendering me temporarily speechless; I had to gather my thoughts and look at my notes before I could comment. But back to the Campbells of Kansas. Everyone has known for some time about Billy\u2019s dependency issues; he\u2019s been riding the roller coaster of addiction for many years. Billy\u2019s father wants to take a hard line with him, while his mother, Hattie, just wants to bring him home and tuck him into the guest bedroom. Brother Jesse objects, \u201cHe\u2019s forty-fricking-seven, Mom.\u201dElder daughter Doro, who is sixty and perhaps the only sane, normal person in the family, is concerned for her mother, who is past eighty and has already had a heart attack. Doro reminds her mother that the family has had its problems before and will have them again; at some point, Hattie has to let go. Either let the siblings help Billy, or let Billy help himself. Hattie cannot do it forever. The setting of Amicus and the time period we see as we reach back into the family\u2019s history is well rendered, but remains discreetly in the background as it should, not hijacking the story. The story itself is based on character, not just of any one person, but of the family itself. By the twenty percent mark I feel as if I have known these people all my life. The full range of emotion is in play as I immerse myself in this intimate novel, and there are many places that make me laugh out loud.It isn\u2019t too long before I can identify someone I know that is a Hattie, and someone that is a Billy. Given the widespread horror of opiate addiction, I will bet you a dollar that you know someone too. But before the halfway mark is reached, a terrible sense of dread comes over me, an aha moment I would not wish on my worst enemy. I begin to sense that perhaps I am Hattie. And within a week of having read this epic story, my eldest child calls and tells me that he\u2019s had a phone call from his younger sibling\u2019s dealer, a man that flatly states, \u201cI don\u2019t want your brother on my conscience, man. I won\u2019t sell to him anymore, but I\u2019m telling you, there are plenty of others that do. You gotta do something, cause he\u2019s out of control.\u201dGenerally, I do not include personal notes in my reviews, because that\u2019s not generally what the reader is looking for. But here I have chosen to do so because this problem is everywhere. In the case of Billy Campbell, there\u2019s a complicating factor: Billy is HIV positive and has been since he was 21. And again, I suspect that for many others, such issues also blur the distinction between medical treatment of some sort, and addiction. I hope that you can get this book and enjoy it for its sly humor, brilliant word-smithery, and unmatchable character development. It\u2019s excellent fiction, just exactly right for a chilly autumn evening in your favorite chair or snuggled beneath the quilts. But for me, it is valuable as a wake-up call, and it will do the same for many other readers also\u2014I have no doubt. It\u2019s the right story, at the right time."}, {"userName": "Martie Nees Record", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4793025-martie-nees-record", "userReview": "Genre: \tAdult FictionPub. Date:\tSeptember 19, 2017Publisher:\tSt. Martin\u2019s Press.Tolstoy's begins \u201cAnna Karenina\u201d with his now famous first line of \"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\" That opening is a fitting way to begin this review. The author, Janet Peery, is a National Book Award finalist in 1996. In this character-driven novel, her work has shades of Jonathan Franzen\u2019s, \u201cThe Corrections.\u201d \u201cExact Nature\u201d is a family drama that looks into the dynamics of a family in Kansas as the parents enter their sunset years. The wife has been a homemaker and her husband is a retired judge who is now showing signs of dementia. They had six children but lost one child decades earlier after a lifetime of health issues. The surviving five adult children are well into middle age and learning how to cope with their aging parents. Unfortunately, their children might be living in their middle-aged bodies, but seem trapped within their ten-year-old minds, filled with sibling rivalry. The children (still in competition for being the favorite) all have eyes on their parents\u2019 estate that they hope to inherit, especially one special chair of their father\u2019s.In an obvious attempt to obtain the chair, the youngest daughter suggests hosting an 89th birthday party for the father. She innocently suggests bringing the chair over to her home so he can sit in it during the party. The siblings all see right through this and they are annoyed. The reader is chuckling. At the party, the youngest, their mother's favorite, passes out in the birthday cake. The youngest is a charming, sweet, gay man who is also hopelessly drug-addicted. They realize once again they will need to drag him to rehab. But it soon becomes clear that, although the youngest is the designated problem child, all the children have issues. Unlike the youngest, they are functioning, but still struggle with prescription drugs, maintaining long-term relationships, foreclosure, DUIs (thank goodness the judge still has some influence), and a hidden sexual identity issue. None are shining stars. In other words, they are your typical dysfunctional family, and they are all unhappy in their own way. But here is the thing: they are as caring as they are troubled. And throughout the story, just when you think they are terrible to one another, you come to see their unbreakable bonds. You will giggle when the daughters take their mom on a \u201cmother-daughter\u201d day road trip to see her childhood home. They almost kill each other through bickering, yet the end result is heartwarming.In beautiful prose, Perry, gives us a portrayal of real life, with characters as flawed as real people. We are given an authentic year in their lives, complete with medical, emotional, mental, physical, and financial troubles. I found this novel to be a spot-on family portrait, with its members still loving each other for who they are. A story about forgiveness without being preachy, it left me with lingering warmth. This is a good book to help one remember that in today\u2019s world we all seem obsessed with appearing perfect, when in reality none of us are or ever will be. The youngest son spends time wondering how there can be so many troubles in a family built around a marriage that seemed troubleless by comparison. He is unable to find an answer. The reader is free to make their own conclusion, for Perry does not tell us. We are left with the thought-provoking question of just what makes a family a happy or unhappy one. It may not be as simple as Tolstoy suggested.I received this novel from the publisher at no cost in exchange for an honest review.Find all my reviews at https://books6259.wordpress.com/Find all my reviews at https://www.goodreads.com/review/list..."}, {"userName": "Dana Portwood", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67549937-dana-portwood", "userReview": "\"Even a hundred years past the town's founding a visitor to Amicus might guess it had been laid out by rival drunks.\" When the first line of a novel makes you chuckle aloud, chances are you aren't going to walk away unhappy. This book is a beautifully written, but not always easy to read. The Campbell family is a very real family, with dysfunction, sibling rivalry, addictions, personality conflicts, sexual identity issues, codepency and a great deal of other unhealthy baggage. If this were all there is to family, it would be a truly bleak story. But family also has deep love, shared history, understanding, loyalty, and the bond of shared childhood. Janet Peery has taken an honest look at a family in decline, in their relationships, their health, both physical and emotional, and their age. She doesn't shy from the distasteful facets of humanity, but her characters are so complex and carefully crafted that they soar as heroes only to plummet as tragic figures in the next sentence. As a recovering codependent and someone who works with people in recovery, the raw honesty of this story often left me breathless. Each family member is relable and real to the point of cutting the reader to the bone. The book doesn't make me \"feel good\" but it makes brings a deep, abiding joy of the permanence of love and the heartbreaking beauty that is life in this world.

The father is a type-A, \"Greatest Generation\" patriarch, and the mother tries to do the difficult job of keeping the oft-dysfunctional family on good terms with each other, especially doting on her HIV-positive youngest son (who is also an addict). Drugs and addiction is a major theme here, as well as enablement, grudges, favoritism, birth order, aging, death, beliefs about the afterlife, etc. Sometimes it veers toward \"drama,\" but the treatment of many of these themes still interested me. Overall, I think the story manages to be realistic (as well as bleak at times) without being too much of a downer. It takes heavy topics and puts human faces on them. I like how the title serves to, in a way, end the story with a philosophical question mark. That doesn't work for every story, but it does here.One thing I noticed after a while is that the narrative of this story tends to veer more toward \"summary.\" Which is fine overall, but in some cases I thought that I wasn't being quite trusted as a reader to come to conclusions about the characters' personalities or motivations on my own, since so much of it was \"told\" to me (though not told badly). For example, it isn't until the second-to-last chapter that we really get a lengthy scene with Billy. I felt like I could \"see\" him so much better after that, but by that point the book is almost over. Before that, he mostly appears in shorter scenes, summaries, and in the summaries of others' thoughts about him. Just an observation--it's certainly a feat to portray five children and two parents convincingly, both collectively and individually. I probably won't read this again, but it was a thought-provoking portrayal.In compliance with FTC guidelines, I disclose that I received this book for free through GoodReads' First Reads."}, {"userName": "Virginia Beam", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28938859-virginia-beam", "userReview": "Hattie Campbell, the matriarch of an extremely dysfunctional family, won't stop enabling her beloved youngest son's drug problem. The rest of the family resents her for it, even though most of them have substance abuse issues of their own. Abel, her husband, is in poor health, and the rest of the family resents him for his prideful, standoffish nature. Actually, The Exact Nature of Our Wrongs is pretty much the story of a family where everyone resents everyone else for something or other.This book had the annoying tone of that writer in your MFA class who is so proud of their clever wordplay that they don't care if the words make a coherent story or not. For at least the first two-thirds of the book, the omniscient narration bounces from perspective to perspective so quickly that you never have to wonder what anyone\u2019s thinking and never wander too deeply into someone\u2019s mind. We're told lots and lots of backstory, but the characters are so over-the-top and unlikable that it's hard to care. I really had to force myself to keep reading.As the book goes on, the manic perspective-switching slows down a bit. Here the writing is sensitive and effective; it was this last third that bumped it up to three stars for me. Had the entire story been written from Hattie's perspective, with much more of the action dramatized instead of told in narrative, it could have been a very moving story.(I received an advance copy of this book for free through a Goodreads giveaway.)"}, {"userName": "Kelley", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7256757-kelley", "userReview": "ARC Received courtesy of Goodreads.com First Reads GiveawayAs member of a family, it's what we do; we keep track of the exact nature of the wrongs we feel are done to us by parents and siblings.

On one hand, or mind (if we want to keep the metaphor consistent), the language of this book is extremely lyrical and precise-- and, to my Midwestern American sensibility, true to the place. There are all of the trappings of small-town Kansas here, including macaroni salad, coffee cans composters, and addictions, hidden or otherwise.On the other hand/mind, the narration of the book in the omniscient perspective constantly drew attention to itself and, thus, drew me out of the story. The author switched between character views many times on some pages, sometimes within the same paragraph. I often felt disjointed or dragged about while reading.On a third hand that I've somehow sprouted, these characters feel real, as real as the place. I understand the desperation of Hattie to keep it all together and Doro to rise above it all. Finally, however, the plot didn't engage me.

Author Janet Peery\u2019s creation of the Campbell clan is dazzling. It is rare to read such a consuming novel about a family that is almost beyond redemption yet not off-putting. Retired judge Able Campbell and his passive and enabling wife Hattie lead the Campbell family. Four of the five Campbell siblings suffer from addiction of some sort, drug, alcohol, or both. All but the eldest, Doro (who is the clean sibling) live near their parents in the blue-collar town of Amicus, Kansas. Able is judgmental, unforgiving, and manipulative. He encourages the children to vie for his affections. Meanwhile, Hattie loves her youngest boy, Billy, the most and has no issue making that clear. The siblings are constant in their need for parental affection; it\u2019s pathetic to read. Billy is a walking nightmare of addiction and abuse of his dotting mother. Yes, Billy plays Hattie like a violin, making her an accessory to all his tragedies. Hattie bails Billy out of all the messes he gets himself into, providing shelter from her judgmental husband. The adult children harbor simmering resentments against each other; they use subterfuge in art form. Peery is known for her literary abilities in exposing humanity clearly and beautifully.

If plot and action are required to keep you turning the pages, you won't find much of that here. Janet Peery tells the story of a Kansas family of eight -- the Campbells -- beset with alcoholism, addiction, and resentments large and small. The problems the six Campbell siblings face are sometimes extreme, but in contrast to many novels that portray extremely dysfunctional families, Janet Peery does not rely on simplistic formulas that lay the blame primarily on the shoulders of the parents' irresponsibility, bad decisions or character flaws. Her writing (and the thoughtfulness that underlies it) is far too nuanced for that. Blame is to be found in all quarters and sometimes just in the vicissitudes of fate. Each of the six Campbell children, as well as their parents, have distinct voices, characters wholly their own, and different responses to the crises they face, another nod to the skill of the writer. On top of all that, their stories are suffused in humor, sometimes black, but hilarious just the same. I didn't rate it five stars, because I generally reserve that distinction for pieces I consider to be masterpieces or near-masterpieces. I didn't think The Exact Nature of our Wrongs quite rose to that level, but it's a damn good novel and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys great writing about family dynamics."}, {"userName": "Susan Bookman", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61237695-susan-bookman", "userReview": "I wanted to like this book since I selected it based on it's summary, but I eventually gave up on page 94. I just couldn't make it through another chapter. It didn't start out so bad, but as Abel begins to have his episodes of hospital psychosis, I really began to wonder if the author was on drugs too or just forcing the writing to make it sound like it. I just couldn't read anymore of the endless meaningless dribble...but I wasn't attached to the characters enough to skip past it to move on. Maybe some readers have more patience than I do. It's not that the book is poorly written; the plot just didn't seem to go anywhere, and the story seemed emotionally flat. I have an expectation that if I am going to invest time in reading a book, I want to be learning something or feeling something, and if this doesn't happen in the first 100 pages, I tend to give up."}], "description": "By a National Book Award finalist for fiction: A warm, dramatic, intimate new novel of a family divided and united by its most vulnerable member.Janet Peery\u2019s first novel, The River Beyond the World, was a National Book Award finalist in 1996.

But when Billy, the youngest sibling\u2014with a history of addiction, grand ideas, and misdemeanors\u2014passes out in his devil\u2019s food cake, the family takes up the unfinished business of Billy\u2019s sobriety.Billy\u2019s misadventures have too long consumed their lives, in particular Hattie\u2019s, who has enabled his transgressions while trying to save him from Abel\u2019s disappointment. As the older children\u2014Doro, Jesse, ClairBell, and Gideon\u2014contend with their own failures, they compete for the approval of the elderly parents they adore, but can\u2019t quite forgive.With knowing humor and sure-handed storytelling, Janet Peery reveals a family at its best and worst, with old wounds and new, its fractures and feuds, and yet its unbreakable bonds.", "title": "The Exact Nature of Our Wrongs", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33574186-the-exact-nature-of-our-wrongs", "average": 3.42, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1500339890l/33574186.jpg", "reviews": 116, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/51313.Janet_Peery", "name": "Janet Peery"}], "type": ["Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33574186-the-exact-nature-of-our-wrongs", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34944288-the-exact-nature-of-our-wrongs", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89384.The_River_Beyond_the_World", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/476019.What_the_Thunder_Said", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1086752.Alligator_Dance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37535829-the-exact-nature-of-our-wrongs", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
