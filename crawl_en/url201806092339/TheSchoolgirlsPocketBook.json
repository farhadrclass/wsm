There are also sections of general information such as facts and figures about the World, different Languages and the British Commonwealth. Although some sections would now need to be updated, I kept this as a handy reference book for many years when I was no longer a \"schoolgirl\". It has useful and interesting facts which are still relevant for children today, in a compact little volume."}], "description": "", "title": "The Schoolgirl's Pocket Book", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39670593-the-schoolgirl-s-pocket-book", "average": 3.0, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1522248665l/39670593.jpg", "reviews": 1, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4262106.Evans_Brothers", "name": "Evans Brothers"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Reference", "Childrens"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39670593-the-schoolgirl-s-pocket-book", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20890724-woodwork-joints"]}
