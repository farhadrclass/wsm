She has just escaped being raped, saved by him . He\u2019s nearly eighteen and she\u2019s nearly fifteen, both so innocent and yet knowing about life in some ways. Tucker and Rhonda decide to marry less than a day after they met. The sparse quiet writing appealed to me from the beginning with simple phrasing full of descriptions that let you see the landscape on this road home to Kentucky as well as understand what these characters are feeling. Fast forward ten years and they still love each other and their children even though they struggle with physical and developmental issues with four of their five children. To provide for his family Tucker is a shine runner bringing danger that changes their lives. While this is very much about place, the back woods of Kentucky, it is primarily a character study. I don\u2019t remember the last time I was as torn over a character as I was about Tucker. It\u2019s hard to condone the things he does, yet I found it impossible to wholeheartedly condemn him. Impossible because he loves his family so deeply. I choked up as he talks to his crib-ridden 9 year old son, Big Billy, about how he would one day teach him to fish and over the conversation he has with his daughter Jo sharing his special, quiet place for her to have when he\u2019s gone. It\u2019s dark and violent in places, creating a tension because it is also a story filled with much love. For more details on the plot, the book description as well as some other reviews can provide those. There\u2019s an epilogue that may have readers wondering if the story would have had a greater impact without it. I loved it. So many times I\u2019ve been left wondering what happened to characters that I came to care about. I was glad to know what happened to their daughter Jo, perhaps my favorite character. For me it also served to emphasize further the moral dilemma that the reader faces, which is so central to the story. While they are very different stories, I had the same feelings at the end of The Homecoming of Samuel Lake. I will definitely look further at other novels by Offutt.I received an advanced copy of this book from Grove Press through Edelweiss."}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "3.5 Set in the hollers of Kentucky, this is Southern Gothic, Southern grit done lean and spare. Tucker,not yet eighteen is returning to his Kentucky home after serving in the Korean War, where he was awarded eight medals for bavery. He meets Rhonda after saving her from a bad situation, he takes her home, they marry and start a family. He starts running shine for the bootlegger boss, a job that takes cunning and skill. When he is offered an opportunity it to improve his family's lot in life he takes it, much to the dismay of his wife.The language is spare, though the descriptions give one a more than adequate look at life in the hills. A life full of hardship for many, and the Tucker family has had more than their fair share of troubles. For Tucker family is everything, and he will do all in his power to keep them safe and together. Tuckeri s a very interesting character, he committed many acts of violence but he is a man whose moral ambiguities are hard to pin down. He is beyond tender with his family but more than hard if anyone crosses him, or poses a threat to his family. He is a character whose actions are hard to approve of, but maybe understandable if seen in a different light.A short book that says much, is very centered on one character which provides for a huge impact. Anovel of family, revenge, hardship and love. The epilogue let's us know how everyone fares after books end,and I'm not sure how I felt about that. Almost think it would have been better, more powerful,if it had just ended at the last chapter.

Along the way, he more or less falls into a job working for a bootlegger, the car he has bought along the way was a runner car, and one thing leads to another.Tucker and Rhonda\u2019s life was never an easy one, babies came along soon, and then another and another, each one loved, but with Tucker gone on the road so much, and Rhonda left to care for the children, some of which more than your average amount of help every day, Rhonda\u2019s life wasn\u2019t easy. I really enjoyed this story, loved Tucker and Rhonda, although this story really belongs more to Tucker. I loved the gentle tension, the feeling of really being in this backwoods world of moonshine, surrounded by the woods of Appalachia. A simpler way of life in both time and place, with its own set of rules to live by. A different definition of beauty than the ones we both judge our life by, and are judged by today. This is a shorter story than most, at 240 pages, but it is filled with heart. I found this to be a little bit on the light side for \u201ccountry-noir,\u201d a good choice for those who are faint of heart.

I've been unable to write a review that captures the quality of the writing, the compelling story-telling, the precise reveal of each plot point and selection of each word, the authenticity of each line of dialogue, the many other reasons I'm still thinking about Tucker and Kentucky 3 weeks after finishing Country Dark. I recommend it to anyone interested in great literature and not of a mind to dismiss all works written post-1968.Here's the review you should read - from author and fellow North Carolinian, David Joy. https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...Plus another penned by Smith Henderson and published in the NY Times Book Review. If we are friends here, you might be aware that I'm one of the least spoiler-averse friends you have.

These pages sing with authenticity down to the details of cold spring water in enameled tin cups. As I read, I was reminded of something I heard an old timer say once about the poverty of mountain people. She said, \"We ain't know we was poor till the government come in here and told us we was.\" There's a passage in this novel where a social worker is trying to explain to her asshole boss why he can't ask yes or no questions, him having just asked a little girl he's never met whether or not her father is working. The social worker says, \"Let me tell you something. You ask yes-or-no questions and you won't get anything. Folks around here don't think that way. A yes-or-no question will make them think there's a right answer and a wrong one. They won't speak because they don't want to make a mistake.\"\"How is being honest a mistake?\"\"When the asker has an agenda. The police do that. Teachers and doctors, too. Now you're doing it. I don't, and that's why they trust me. I know you're my boss, Dr. Miller, but things in the hills aren't that simple--who's boss and who's not. If somebody's working or not, if a little girl is happy or sad. It's not black and white here. It's all gray.\"This is the type of detail outsiders get wrong when they try to write about this place. Appalachia is not a trope, and it's tiring to keep reading shitty books by shitty writers who aren't from these mountains and have never lived in these mountains and who set a story here just because they think it'll sell. Chris got these details right because he knows this place and he knows these people. As hard as part of this story is, he got to the humanity of it and that's all anyone can ask."}, {"userName": "Kelly (and the Book Boar)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11183856-kelly-and-the-book-boar", "userReview": "Because Shelby made me want David Joy's new book and then David Joy made me want this new book and now I'm gonna make Shelby want this new book . . . .

The tree line was gone and hilltops blended with the black tapestry of night. It was country dark. He closed his eyes, feeling safe.\" This is a fantastic piece of Southern Gothic: Chris Offutt takes his readers to rural Kentucky to tell a story about family and revenge, crime and punishment, responsibility and love - and as in every book worth your while in this genre, the lines between moral categories start to blur the deeper you dive into the story: \"War and prison had taught him that sides didn't really exist, that everyone was eventually caught in the middle of something.\"Offutt's protagonist Tucker is nearly eighteen and just came back from the war in Korea, his whole possessions being 400 dollars of army pay. After he saves a young girl named Rhonda from violence, he marries her and they start a family. To support his wife and children, Tucker engages in criminal activities - he and Rhonda have known nothing but poverty, but they are trying very hard to provide for their kids and live a dignified, godly life (we're in the Bible belt, after all). And while this would be hard for every family in their situation, some of their children are born with disabilities - as the state prepares to take these kids away, Tucker takes extreme measures to protect his family, thus setting in motion a whole chain of events. Offutt creates extremely vivid characters and knows exactly how to play with the conventions of Southern Gothic - his tale about justice and family is everything Fiona Mozley wanted her Booker-shortlisted novel Elmet to be. While the story clearly takes place in the 50's and 60's, the social issues Offutt tackles are shockingly current and seem to touch neuralgic points in Trump's divided America: The potentially negative role of the state, the unjust prison system and, most importantly, the situation of the rural poor. I really admire how Offutt portrays the thinking and the convictions of the Tucker family, because he makes the reader experience the plight of those that are often looked down upon or even loathed by people who deem themselves progressives. It is obvious that Offutt knows quite a bit about Kentucky and its people: He was born in Lexington, and all of Offutt's books are set in Kentucky or are about people from Kentucky. This year, he was the recipient of the Kentucky Literary Award (for My Father, the Pornographer: A Memoir). It also shows that Offutt teaches not only English, but also Screenwriting at Ole Miss: Many scenes have a cinematic feel, and this book would certainly make a great movie, preferrably directed by the Coen brothers. So all in all, a really good book that will hopefully find many readers."}, {"userName": "Faith", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17430801-faith", "userReview": "\"I got one last little bit of trouble to take care of.\" Set in rural Kentucky, this is a spare, character-driven novel about a young man. Tucker is a gentle, loving and protective family man. He and his wife Rhonda marry as teenagers in 1954, immediately after meeting. They rapidly have 6 children, four of whom have severe physical or mental developmental problems. Mostly things just happen to Tucker. The only acts he seems capable of planning are violent ones. He's a sympathetic character, but you can certainly have conflicted feelings about him. He just falls into his job as driver for a bootlegger because he happens to have bought the right kind of car. He marries Rhonda because he happens to rescue her from an assault as he is passing by on his way home from the Korean War. Killing people just seems like a reasonable solution to his difficulties. Rhonda starts out as a shrewd 14 year old but appears to regress over the years and become more childlike as guilt and depression over her children wear her down. The epilogue is simplistic and unnecessary and I recommend not reading it. It's also unbelievable. Have they not heard of fingerprint evidence in Kentucky in the 1970s? Tucker was a believable character, the book was well written and isn't afflicted by the testosterone fueled posturing that annoys me in a lot of rural noir novels.

Set in Eastern Kentucky from the 1950s to the early 1970s, it humanizes without condescending or romanticizing. Tucker is a Korean war vet who comes back to his home town to settle down and make a life for himself. He hasn't even turned 18, and on the way home he meets and falls in love with Rhonda. They marry and have several children, and Tucker supports them by running moonshine for the local bootlegger (and buyer of politicians). It's a beyond hardscrabble life, especially since several of their children have disabilities. But Tucker and Rhonda love and respect each other and love their children unreservedly.Eventually the risks of the job catch up with Tucker, who bears them with his characteristic stoicism and makes plans for his family's future. When the compensation he's been promised looks to be endangered, he takes action. There is violence and sadness throughout this story, but it's never sensationalized or used to manipulate the reader. The writing is brilliant; I can see the comparisons to Raymond Carver because it is similarly restrained, but it feels warmer to me."}, {"userName": "Bandit", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4528663-bandit", "userReview": "There\u2019s actually no reasonable accounting for how much I liked this book, considering that traditionally this sort of thing would interest me about as much as visiting Kentucky\u2019s lesser populated areas, which is to say not that much. Seems like all the credit should be given to the author for creating such a completely engaging account with such compelling and interesting characters. I didn\u2019t want to put this book down and, since it isn\u2019t very long (Offutt is laconic, though not quite to the extent of his protagonist), was able to finish it in one day. What does one even describe this style of literature as\u2026country noir? That isn\u2019t just a pun on the name either. There\u2019s just something genuinely nourish about the narrative and Tucker\u2019s stoic silent manner (countrified as it may be) is right out of the genre classics. And Tucker is a great character, tough, street smart, a devoted family man, a real fighter no matter the odds. The exact sort of a lead a reader would want in fiction, someone to care about. The writing was aces, never read the author before, but he certainly knows what he\u2019s doing, loved the sparse economic narration that skips on nothing of importance. Plenty of details to recreate a bygone era of the middle of the last century, this is a real slice of Americana and a terrific read.

As did the author, my brother.It's hard for me to put into words what goes through my mind and heart when I read this. Everything is so familiar and so right. The scenery, the people, the values, the relationships, and the way they all interact is comforting in an odd way. It's as if it all fits together in \"like it should.\" Like looking at a green forest and my eyes fully relax, or sitting in my favorite chair that fits my body perfectly.That's partly because I'm from there. But largely because Country Dark perfectly captures essential things about Appalachia.Tucker reminds me of people I know, but is clearly not a copy of a single individual. He is a vet (lots of vets in eastern KY), very competent, and has a lot of intelligence and knowledge without much formal education.It bugs me that people don't distinguish between Appalachia and the South. I've lived in both and know they're very different. This book is not about the south ... it's about Appalachia.American Nations, by Colin Woodard, models north America as having 11 \"nations\" that have distinct cultures, values, and history. I thought the distinction was fascinating and has a lot of truth. And it explains the difference between the south and Appalachia very well.Country Dark brings up troublesome questions. Was it a justified killing? Definitely illegal, but justified and legal are different. Marvin was doing what he thought was right. Helping out a family who had big problems and didn't know how to help themselves. To Appalachians, that's typical Yankee-thinking: \"I know what's good for you and I will force you to do it because people like me make the laws.\" To Tucker, however, Marvin was a foreigner threatening his family. Marvin came onto his land, into his house, and planned to kidnap his children. Using deadly force is simply self-protection.Maybe that points to a deep problem in America ... we still don't have a universally shared value system. Many southerners still believe in a class-based society and think the wrong side won the civil war. When I lived in the south I knew a lot of people who thought they were enlightened because they believed slavery was wrong and had a black friend, but deep down they thought black people were not as smart as white people, were not as energetic, were naturally more violent, and their lives weren't as valuable. Maybe they didn't even know it themselves. I met people who respected me for my brains and education, but could never think I was as good as they were--I was just a country boy from Kentucky. That's a far cry from southern aristocracy.The north imposed its will on the south, but did not convert them. To me at least, that's the core of why Tucker killed Marvin. And killing someone illegally doesn't make Tucker a bad man, because it was a good act within his belief system.I love the minimalist way Offutt writes. It's like the Beatles ... they cut and they cut until there was nothing left but the essence of their music.For someone from Appalachia, eastern Kentucky, and even Rowan county, the book has some fun easter eggs. That is, references that most people won't get.I love this book. I was the first fan of Chris Offutt and still the best fan."}, {"userName": "Bookworm", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31167656-bookworm", "userReview": "4 gritty stars for Country. Dark I'm not usually one for character driven narratives but the author did a wonderful job of taking the reader into the bowels of the back woods of Kentucky. We meet Tucker, a war veteran, who has only a couple hundred bucks to his name and no close family to speak of. He's returning to his home in the Kentucky hills, in search of a wife, and with hopes of settling into a normal existence. The book primarily focuses on his years postwar and the struggles he encounters living in rural Kentucky spanning from the 1950's to 1970's.I empathized with Tucker. His way of life was so well portrayed that I completely understood him. Although flawed, he was a likeable character and the heart of the book. I will admit I was captivated by this story. I can't say why exactly except that I didn't know where it was going and that was certainly part of the draw. I also found the descriptions of rural Kentucky and the folks living in that part of the state to be fascinating. The characters are well developed, which fully engages the reader. It is definitely a GRITTY read and I liked that too! There's violence mixed with a growing tension as the story unfolds. I was utterly captivated until the very end.

A chance encounter along the way changes the trajectory of his life. This is a story about the poverty and love. Survival, family, sacrifice and making hard decisions. The characters were good.

Though a dark and ultimately rather sad story, I thought it was really well-done."}, {"userName": "Carla", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7965254-carla", "userReview": "I was drawn to this book by its comparison to William Gay's books about rural Kentucky. While it certainly lent itself to the same flavour, I found myself wanting more depth in the characters. Believe it or not, after seeing all the accolades of this writer, I was astounded I'd not read any previous work. This book however, was many years in coming. The premise of poor Kentucky hill people, who have little or no education, but love family fiercely is endearing. Bootlegging, trying to make ends meet, running from the law, are elements that were part of the story after Tucker, the main character returns from the Korean war. I enjoyed, but it was short, and I found myself unfulfilled after adoring Mr. Gay's works."}, {"userName": "Tonstant Weader", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2050909-tonstant-weader", "userReview": "Country Dark is the story of Tucker, a young man from the hollers of Kentucky. It opens as he\u2019s returning from the Korean Wa. He rescues Rhonda from a rape-intent uncle. They marry right away. He\u2019s seventeen and she\u2019s fourteen. He works as a bootlegger. They love each other but their marriage is challenged by all but one of their children suffering from developmental disabilities. This is a sorrow, but they still love their children. There is so much tenderness when Tucker comes home, sits down next to his hydrocephalic son, holds his hand and tells him about his day, talking to him about life, as he lies there unresponsive.There are complications from rivals, corrupt law enforcement, and children\u2019s services, but Tucker does whatever is necessary to protect his family. The story is at once heartbreaking and affirming.I loved Country Dark for many reasons. The writing is beautiful. The wealth of country knowledge and the sense of place are extraordinary. The prose is entrancing, but the characters are bit inexplicable. For example, Tucker forces Rhonda\u2019s awful uncle to sell him his car, one that was retrofitted for bootlegging, which seems to be reason enough for him to become a bootlegger. I get that it never occurs to him to use the GI Bill to get an education, but he couldn\u2019t consider some honest local occupation? Have car, will bootleg?He knows it\u2019s an occupation that risks his family, so he doesn\u2019t do everything he could to protect his family. Then the curse of the developmentally disabled children. Thanks to medical tests, we know there\u2019s no medical reason. Are we supposed to reason this is some curse? I wondered about environmental contamination, but that\u2019s not part of the story.But even though it makes no sense on many levels, I liked Tucker, I liked his daughter. I liked Rhonda. I wanted the best for them and cared about what happened and that\u2019s the point. And as I said, the prose is nearly magical. It entranced me enough to overlook the lack of character development.I also loved the final chapter wrapping up what happened to people in the book, even the minor characters. That was such great fun.I received a copy of Country Dark from the publisher through Edelweiss.Country Dark at Grove AtlanticChris Offutt author sitehttps://tonstantweaderreviews.wordpre..."}, {"userName": "Janet", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7141051-janet", "userReview": "Oh my! I just finished this and am breathless. What a wonderful wonderful book! I may have a new favorite author. I will definitely be reading his other works ASAP. You must read this if only for the incredible prose. Offutt is a highly skilled writer with a fascinating story to tell about a family in Appalachia. I could swear I\u2019ve been in the forested hills, hollers and creeks and know the people in the story like family. His prose was so evocative. I couldn\u2019t put it down. I would give it six stars if I could. I highly recommend this for anyone with a heart and a love of great storytelling."}, {"userName": "Viktoria", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12034280-viktoria", "userReview": "I found Offutt\u2019s characters alive: wanted them to succeed; worried about them; especially worried about what would happen to them, knowing how far back to the wall they have been driven. They make you live and breathe the remote hills of Kentucky. The most moving moments are Tucker\u2019s talks with Big Billy. I was so absorbed by the story telling that I missed many nuances of Offutt\u2019s visual writing style.

He falls in love and starts a family, and while the Tuckers don\u2019t have much, they have the love of their home and each other. But when his family is threatened, Tucker is pushed into violence, which changes everything. The story of people living off the land and by their wits in a backwoods Kentucky world of shine-runners and laborers whose social codes are every bit as nuanced as the British aristocracy, Country Dark is a novel that blends the best of Larry Brown and James M. Cain, with a noose tightening evermore around a man who just wants to protect those he loves. It reintroduces the vital and absolutely distinct voice of Chris Offutt, a voice we\u2019ve been missing for years.Chris Offutt is an outstanding literary talent, whose work has been called \u201clean and brilliant\u201d (New York Times Book Review) and compared by reviewers to Tobias Wolff, Ernest Hemingway, and Raymond Carver. He\u2019s been awarded the Whiting Writers Award for Fiction/Nonfiction and the American Academy of Arts and Letters Fiction Award, among numerous other honors. His first work of fiction in nearly two decades, Country Dark, is a taut, compelling novel set in rural Kentucky from the Korean War to 1970.", "title": "Country Dark", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36556924.Country_Dark", "average": 4.28, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1515529694l/36556924.jpg", "reviews": 75, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/10188.Chris_Offutt", "name": "Chris Offutt"}], "type": ["Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36556924-country-dark", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37487288-country-dark", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36692300-country-dark", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25814236-my-father-the-pornographer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18334.Kentucky_Straight", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18335.Out_of_the_Woods", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18339.The_Same_River_Twice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/912633.The_Good_Brother"]}
