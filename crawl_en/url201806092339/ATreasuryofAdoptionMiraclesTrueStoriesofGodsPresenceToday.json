As an adoptive parent myself I felt a kinship to those in the book. However, I wish more would have been shared regarding adopting older children, not just babies, toddlers, and pre-school age children. Adoption of older youth is just as much a blessing and gift."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/334836-laura", "userReview": "I enjoyed the stories but they seemed kind of over the top.
