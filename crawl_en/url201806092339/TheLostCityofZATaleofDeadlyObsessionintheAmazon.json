We don\u2019t need to SAVE the rainforest. We need to DESTROY the rainforest. Immediately. I knew that the Amazon was a hostile environment, but I was really shocked at the variety of horrific ways that the jungle will kill a person. You\u2019ve got your standard malaria and yellow fever. Then there\u2019s the piranha, the electric eels, the anacondas, the coral snakes or the poisonous toads that are so toxic that one of them could kill a hundred people. Still not convinced? How about the tiny fish that will swim into any orifice and proceed to do things so terrible that sometimes men had to be castrated to survive.That\u2019s not even talking about the bugs. Sure, the mosquitoes spread disease, but there\u2019s also a variety of maggot that will infect living tissue. Ants that can eat your clothes in a single night. Chiggers that eat human tissue. Cyanide squirting millipedes. Parasitic worms that cause blindness. Bugs that plant larvae under the skin where it will hatch later. \u2018Kissing bugs\u2019 that bite the lips but the victim doesn\u2019t die until 20 years later when their brain or heart swells.Even if that doesn\u2019t kill you, you\u2019d probably starve to death in what is described as a counterfeit paradise. Because even though there\u2019s all kinds of plants and animals, good luck finding anything edible. Avoid the animals, the disease, the bugs, injury, and starving to death, and you\u2019re still screwed when hostile natives catch you, eat you and use your skull as their favorite coffee mug.To hell with the Amazon. Burn or bulldoze all of it and sow the earth with salt. That treacherous hellhole has to be obliterated before it can spread. And I don\u2019t want to hear about global warming or any nonsense about generating most of the world\u2019s oxygen. We can breathe shallow, people!Old Percy Fawcett was a veteran explorer who mounted several expeditions into the Amazon and somehow managed to escape with his life. But he got obsessed with finding the mythical ruins of an El Dorado-type city and led his son and another poor bastard to some kind of gruesome deaths. The mystery of what happened to him led to countless deaths from other dumb asses trekking into the jungle to look for them. The guy who wrote the book knew all this and he was still stupid enough to go in there. He somehow lived through it, but I think the message is clear.

You won\u2019t want to put it down. In 1925, Percy Harrison Fawcett, armed with information only he had unearthed, accompanied by his son, his son\u2019s best friend and a small company of bearers and support personnel, headed off into the Amazonian wilderness in search of a large, ancient, fabled city, the City of Z. Fawcett, his son, Jack, and Jack\u2019s friend, Raleigh, were never seen again. There were many attempts by later explorers of varying levels of expertise to find Fawcett, or at least to learn definitively of his fate. Professional writer David Grann joins that horde, armed with little or no experience as an outdoorsman and having his athletic prowess honed by years as a subway-riding resident of Brooklyn. Not, perhaps, the likeliest starting point. He sets out on a strenuous enterprise in an attempt to explain this 80 year old mystery. David GrannWhile Grann\u2019s book is non-fiction, it reads like an H. Rider Haggard action adventure novel. You will feel palpable excitement as Grann digs up first one then another then another clue as to where Fawcett might have wound up. He follows research directions ignored or unsuspected by prior investigators, to great advantage. I won\u2019t spoil the ending by telling what he does or does not find. That is almost beside the point. It is the journey that counts here, and part of that journey is the window Grann offers on a part of the history of exploration, the sort of people who were drawn to it, their reasons, their personalities, the effect of their quests (or obsessions, depending) on their careers, families and on the body of human knowledge. We learn also of competing theories about the potential for the Amazon to support a large, urban population. Grann shows, as well, the challenges, the horrors of trying to traverse one of the most unwelcoming areas on earth. This is a very entertaining, very informative and very engaging journey.

Over eighteen thousand feet high in the Andes, amid snow and clouds, it emerges through a rocky seam--a trickle of crystal water.\u201dBy the time it reaches the ocean, the estuary of the Amazon river at the mouth is 202 miles wide. A trickle becomes one of the mightiest forces on the planet. \n\n\nColonel Percy Fawcett, the legend that launched a thousand explorers.Candice Millard, in her book about Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s trip through the Amazon, summed it up nicely: \u201dThe rainforest was not a garden of easy abundance, but precisely the opposite. Its quiet, shaded halls of leafy opulence were not a sanctuary, but rather the greatest natural battlefield on the planet, hosting an unremitting and remorseless fight for survival that occupied every single one of its inhabitants, every minute of every day.\u201dDavid Grann, the author, became fascinated with Colonel Percy Fawcett after he stumbled upon a treasure trove of his journals. He wasn\u2019t alone. Thousands have also found his story fascinating; hundreds have been so inspired by him as to go into the Amazonian jungle in search of him, their heads dancing with visions of being the next Henry Morton Stanley to find a famous missing explorer. \nThere are as many visions of what El Dorado looks like as there are explorers to look for it.On his final journey to the Amazon in 1925, Fawcett was determined to finally find El Dorado, or the City of Z as he liked to call it, but he\u2026disappeared without a trace. Not that it is difficult to disappear in a jungle as dangerous as the Amazon. Everything from the most microscopic insect to infections to pumas are trying to kill you, not to mention the local tribesmen who may think you are interesting enough to let live or even more interesting to roast on a spit. There was one description that made me shiver: \u201dEspundia, an illness with even more frightening symptoms. Caused by a parasite transmitted by sand flies, it destroys the flesh around the mouth, nose, and limbs, as if the person were slowly dissolving. \u2018It develops into...a mass of leprous corruption.\u2019\u201dSo why do Amazonian explorers insist on trying to conquer such an inhospitable place? Because it is there.But also because there are people who feel an itch so intense that they have to go somewhere as far away from people as possible. \u201dIndeed, some might say that explorers become explorers precisely because they have a streak of unsociability and a need to remove themselves at regular intervals as far as possible from their fellow men.\u201d I resemble that comment, but my solution is less glamorous. I\u2019m more likely to descend into the bowels of my library and let my books take me to Istanbul, Manchu Picchu, Gettysburg, or even, yes, to places as inhospitable as the Amazon. I can navigate the river without coming down with some hideous infection or being drained dry by a vampire bat because my arm flopped outside the netting in the middle of the night or feel the sting of a poisonous arrow puncturing my neck. My martini stays dry and at the proper temperature, too. Besides the desire for discovery, Fawcett was fortunate to have an iron constitution. While other members of his party were dropping like flies from a host of illnesses or injuries, he just marched on. He lost several key years to the trenches of WW1, and when he emerged from the war to start finding funding for his final trip, he discovered that his patron, the Royal Geological Society, was broke. He had to find financing elsewhere. America beckoned.Fawcett believed in small parties rather than large, heavily armed parties for exploring the Amazon. He had a rule that I think said a lot about his character, but also about his depth of wisdom. \u201dDie if you must, but never kill.\u201d Unlike other European and American explorers, he was not in love with his guns. He was there to explore and discover, not conquer.\nPercy\u2019s son Jack Fawcett looking very fit for his venture into the jungle.Decades after his final dispatch from the jungle, Fawcett\u2019s wife and remaining family (he took his teenage son Jack with him) continued to believe that one day he would emerge from the jungle with a tale so epic that only Homer could tell it properly. Grann, too, like so many others before him, became infatuated with what became of Fawcett. He is not made in the same mold as Fawcett, or really any explorer. He is short, pudgy, and not athletic, but he is helped by some modern conveniences that Fawcett would have snickered at the prospect of using. If you so dare, strap on your machete and hack your way through the Amazon with Fawcett, and see if the jungle will eat you or make you into a legend. \u201dThose whom the Gods intend to destroy they first make mad!\u201d\n\n\nThe movie was released April 17th, 2017.

There's the threat of piranhas, electric eels, venomous snakes, vampire fish, vampire bats, disease-carrying mosquitoes, dangerous spiders, poisonous plants... and about a hundred other scary things. I fear the jungle because I respect it.* I also respect those who have set out to explore the jungle \u2014 many of whom have died or disappeared. Some of those folks are the subject of David Grann's fascinating book, The Lost City of Z. Grann himself became a bit obsessed with the Amazon, hoping to discover what happened to the British explorer Percy Fawcett, who went missing in the Amazon in 1925. Fawcett had been searching for an ancient civilization, nicknamed Z, and after he disappeared, dozens of people also went into the Amazon trying to find him and the lost city. Some never returned. This book is part travelogue, part history, part outdoor adventure. I really enjoyed reading it (even though descriptions of the jungle are terrifying) and I'm looking forward to watching the movie that is based on this book. This is the third Grann book I've read this year \u2014 I also recommend Killers of the Flower Moon and The Devil and Sherlock Holmes \u2014 and I've become such a fan of Grann's work that I'll happily read his future books. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go buy some antivenom and mosquito nets. JUST TO BE SAFE.*Note: Another great-and-terrifying book about the Amazon jungle is Candice Millard's The River of Doubt. Highly recommended.Meaningful Passage\"For nearly a century, explorers have sacrificed everything, even their lives, to find the City of Z. The search for the civilization, and for the countless men who vanished while looking for it, has eclipsed the Victorian quest novels of Arthur Conan Doyle and H. Rider Haggard \u2014 both of whom, as it happens, were drawn into the real-life hunt for Z. At times, I had to remind myself that everything in this story is true: a movie star really was abducted by Indians; there were cannibals, ruins, secret maps, and spies; explorers died from starvation, disease, attacks by wild animals, and poisonous arrows; and at stake amid the adventure and death was the very understanding of the Americas before Christopher Columbus came ashore in the New World.\""}, {"userName": "Jason Koivu", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1742824-jason-koivu", "userReview": "This will make you feel like a kid again! It will ignite a Jonny Quest kind of desire for adventure, to dive into the jungle in search of lost worlds.This will also quench most desires to ever take one step closer to a jungle. \"Z\" is supposedly a long lost South American city of a once powerful people. Think El Dorado. Did it ever really exist? Finding out was the self-imposed task of an almost legend of a man who lives up to the myth:Famous British explorer Percy Harrison Fawcett...A military man with an athlete's physique and a cast iron constitution, Fawcett made the perfect explorer. As fortune would have it, he lived in a time and place where conquering the last of our Earth's unknowns was in high fashion: Victorian England.I've read a few of these sorts of books and I've come to expect the unavoidable asides. After all, to take this book as an example, there is always going to be more to the story than just one man trying to find one lost city. The Lost City of Z is fattened by many an aside discussing the myriad of Victorian era explorers who threw themselves into harm's way for glory and adventure. It was almost like a game to them, a great race to see who could get there first, be it the depths of the jungle or the arctic pole.Author David Grann juggles these stories well, never dropping the main story, at least no more than necessary to incorporate the interesting details from these off-shoot tales that help the reader to better understand the mindset of the times or to underscore the perils of such treks into the unknown.In the process of putting this book together, tracking Fawcett became Grann's adventure. However, it turned out to be one shared by many. Fawcett went on numerous South American explorations with varying degrees of success and always emerging - though slightly worse for wear - in relatively good health compared to the many who perished along the way. However, after disappearing into the jungle one last time, with his son and a friend in-tow on this occasion, Fawcett disappeared forever. In the years that followed, finding Fawcett became a new kind of sport that swept the world. Many expeditions set out to find and bring the man back, dead or alive. As you read The Lost City of Z you begin to form the opinion that \"dead\" is the only possible outcome for anyone foolish enough to set foot in the jungle. Grann's descriptions of the jungle's deprivations felt to me like watching a David Attenborough nature program in Feel-o-vision...every sting, bite and virulent disease feels like its invading your body. I itched unconsciously at every mention of the ubiquitous insects. I swore my skin creeped and I could feel a fever coming on. So, if you've got Indiana Jones aspirations, this is the cure!"}, {"userName": "Nancy Oakes", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900340-nancy-oakes", "userReview": "I picked up this book and was immediately lost between the covers and could not stop reading until I had finished the entire thing. That's how good this book is.The author sets forth the story of Colonel Percy Harrison Fawcett, a British explorer who in 1925 set out on an expedition to the Amazon to find what he had named the \"lost city of Z.\" He was convinced that an ancient and \"highly cultured\" people lived in the Amazon of Brazil, untouched by modern civilization, and that they lived in a great city in a valley somewhere. He spent years doing research and gathering evidence for the existence of this place in order to get funding for expeditions into Brazil's interior. On the 1925 expedition, he took his son, Jack, and Jack's best friend, both eager to be part of a mission that would make history. But shortly after they had arrived into the Amazon area, all communications ceased, and while their movements were traced to a point, nothing concrete was ever heard regarding the three explorers. Their disappearance, and the publicity following the mission from which they never returned, prompted years worth of explorers trying to locate any trace of Fawcett, his son, and his son's friend, even as late as 1996. Too bad for those left behind, Fawcett, who was facing a lot of competition from others exploring the Amazon at the time, and worried that these other explorers might find the lost city of Z before he would, kept his route a very closely guarded secret, so it was pretty much impossible for anyone to go in to either locate bodies, effect a rescue or even trace with any accuracy the steps taken by Fawcett and his group. Although Fawcett's wife refused to believe that her husband and son were gone, they had pretty much just vanished off the face of the earth. Grann, who writes for the New Yorker, decided to try to find Fawcett's route and discover what had happened to him once and for all. This book not only traces Grann's efforts, but takes the reader back into the Victorian period, at the peak of the British Empire, to look at exactly who Percy Fawcett was. It also examines old and modern views of the indigenous peoples of the Amazon as well as offers a glimpse of the fate of the rain forest in modern times.Simply stunning and superb, I loved this book so much that I pre-ordered a copy for when it is released for the general reading public. The writing is excellent, the mystery surrounding Fawcett's disappearance is well portrayed, and the amount of effort that Grann went to in his research is very much apparent here. If you are looking for something entirely different that will mesmerize you instantly, you cannot miss this book. I had never heard about any of this up until now, & my curiosity has been sparked enough that I made notes and took down book titles to fill in some holes in my knowledge. I cannot recommend this book highly enough, and I would like to thank Doubleday for sending me this book and also those on Shelf Awareness for offering it as an ARC. It is an excellent piece of writing."}, {"userName": "Richard Derus", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3920693-richard-derus", "userReview": "Rating: 4.5* of fiveThis review has been revised and can now be found at Expendable Mudge Muses Aloud.Real-life Indiana Jones doesn't come back from this one. 2017 Movie News: Go watch the trailer for this Amazon Studios film.

Amazon might very well be Satan, I can't say I agree but there's a chorus of unhappy people from contractors to suppliers to anti-globalization zealots who say it is, but Satan's offering us a lot of really great inducements to forget his agenda. Amazon's Prime streaming service alone is worth the $100 a year it costs. I love that so much of Amazon Studios' output is book-based. Calculated or not, it's a great thing to see the filmed entertainment industry gain a player that mines the immense vein of unadapted written work instead of churning out sequels and comic book heroes and the occasional bland screensaver-level movie.But...having Prime-watched it...it is a disappointing film, and I was so hoping for something outstanding. It's gorgeous. It's utterly gorgeous. It's a Prime freebie and deserves watching for the cinematography. The WWI bits are pornily lovely, in love with their violence but curiously unmoving like porn. But the damned film isn't anything like as effective as the book! I am not, as you who read my reviews regularly are aware, a knee-jerk book's better boy. In this case, goddammit, the book's better at getting you in the feelz. PS Charlie Hunnam is gorgeous but wrong for this role.

Seriously though, as noted in my review of Candice Millard's The River of Doubt: Theodore Roosevelt's Darkest Journey, and further evidenced in reading this tale, the jungle is a punishing, dangerous place. As per usual, I'll refer to Sterling Archer for wisdom (see River of Doubt review), \"Everything out here either wants to eat me or give me malaria!\"*The hunt for the \nCity of Z\n follows the footsteps of professional explorer and part-time crazy person, Percy Fawcett (below, in an image which also suggests he may have been a Sherlock Holmes cos-play enthusiast), who went down jungle-yonder in search of the real-world, lost civilization equivalent of El Dorado.\nFawcett would probably be appalled by any comparisons with Roosevelt, but they did both take their sons into the unforgiving tropical environs and raise the hackles of the culturally-competent Marechal C\u00e2ndido Mariano da Silva Rondon (below yucking it up with an indigenous peoples).\nBig difference between Fawcett and TR? Fawcett never came back. Seen below with fellow explorer and guide Raleigh Rimell shortly before the expedition vanished, Fawcett's story, in the hands of David Grann was equal parts River of Doubt and \nSkyjack: The Hunt for D.B. Cooper\n as tales unravel of the many minds and/or lives lost in attempts to solve the mystery of a missing man.\nSo what's Grann's take on all this jungle business? Well, pretty darn similar to Millard's who he, in fact, quotes in her description of the deathcage smackdown that is Amazonia:\n\nThe rainforest was not a garden of easy abundance, but precisely the opposite. Its quiet, shaded halls of leafy opulence were not a sanctuary, but rather the greatest natural battlefield anywhere on the planet, hosting an unremitting and remorseless fight for survival that occupied every single one of its inhabitants, every minute of every day.\n\nWhy such hysteria? Well you've got your classics- poisonous snakes, jaguars, and crocodiles (\"aka the world's most deadliest predators\"- Archer's words, not Grann's). There's also a boatload of clever camouflage going down, para exaple (Portuguese) a caterpillar that makes itself look like a viper.\nIf you manage to avoid getting a fish lodged in your orifices, you still have disease to contend with. In addition to quotidien little things like Malaria, there's espundia.\n\"an illness...caused by a parasite transmitted by sand flies, it destroys the flesh around the mouth, nose, and limbs, as if the person were slowly dissolving.\"\nObviously there are pictures of what that little gem of an illness can do on the internet, but even I have my limits. Oh, and also the reaction to white men waltzing into a camp of natives isn't always predictable.A fascinating, fun read that probably would have been a bit more riveting if I hadn't read The River of Doubt quite so recently.

Fawcett was searching for an ancient lost city that he called Z. The 3 men were never seen again. Over the decades after their disappearance, several teams and even individuals ventured into the dense jungle to find the famed explorer. Some of them reappeared weeks or months later sick and emaciated, and some were never seen again. No real trace of Fawcett was ever found. Plenty of rumors and lies......but no bodies or real evidence as to their fate. Fawcett's wife was never the same again. Flash forward to modern times, and New Yorker writer David Grann also goes to the Amazon jungle in search of evidence of Fawcett's fate. I love history and tales of the old style explorers....the men who trekked off into the unknown just because it was unknown. Not the sort of people who explored to make money, or to gain renown. But real explorers....the ones who mapped the world, discovered indigenous peoples and didn't plot to murder them all or evangelize them, the ones who climbed, trekked and discovered new places just because they were there. Fawcett was one of these men. Unfortunately, as with many explorers, his belief in himself, his obsession with his quest and his feelings of invincibility eventually caught up with him -- and he took two young men with him. He escaped fate multiple times.....but it catches up with everyone eventually. In 1925, he walked into the jungle in a valiant attempt to search for the Lost City of Z that he knew to his soul was there, and disappeared forever into the mysteries and tall tales that grow from such stories. Just a head's up for readers -- this is not a fictionalized story. This is a non-fiction account of the history of exploration in the Amazon jungle, the story of Fawcett's life and treks around the world, the fate of other explorers of the time, facts about his son and friend that went along on the 1925 trip, and the aftermath of the disappearance. There is also an accounting of David Grann's trip to the Amazon to glean facts about the fate of Fawcett, the local indigenous peoples and how the area has changed since the 1920s. Readers who don't like historical accounts of facts and information might want to pass this book by. But, for those who enjoy history....this story is awesome!! I loved this book! Anyone who enjoyed Douglas Preston's recent book, The Lost City of the Monkey God, will also enjoy this book. I listened to the audiobook version of this book. Read by Mark Deakins, the audio is just over 10 hours long. Deakins reads at a nice pace with an even, pleasant tone. I have hearing loss but was easily able to understand this entire book. It is obvious that Grann did a lot of detailed research into Amazon exploration, Fawcett and many other treks around the world at the time. He gives details of Fawcett's journals and news stories from the time, and information gleaned from Amazon natives and others. Such an interesting and intriguing story!!Because the book includes information gleaned from writings, journals and other sources from the time, there are some racist overtones in portions of this story. Many scientists, explorers, politicians, journalists -- hell, even the general white populus -- viewed indigenous peoples (or people of color in general) as lesser human beings, stating that there is no possible way they ever created a large society because it would be impossible for them to do so. At times as I listened, I found myself making snarky remarks to these long-dead idiots. Some of those old views were what started horrible and asinine beliefs/movements like eugenics, or cultural destruction by evangelization. Oh, we are white and must go to these countries and whitesplain to the natives that they are inferior, and must mold to our moral ideals or perish. Blah, blah, blah. What a load of racist crap. My take on the entire matter is this: how could anyone believe themselves superior to people who can survive and thrive in the most hazardous and inhospitable parts of the world when the whites who ventured there died in droves?? But as they were venturing into the jungle and dying of disease, starvation, accidents, predation, and native attacks, they wholeheartedly believed themselves freaking superior because of the color of their skin and their fat, sheltered lives in the modern world. Really?? Seems to me the people that can survive and feed themselves in that place are the superior ones. Amazon has released an original movie based on this book. I wanted to watch it, but had to follow my rule of always reading the book first. Now that I've read the book, I can enjoy the film! :) I hope it keeps the integrity of Grann's research and doesn't fall into over-grandizing fiction, rather than the interesting true facts of the case. David Grann is the author of several books including The Devil & Sherlock Holmes: Tales of Murder, Madness & Obsession. I'm definitely going to be reading more of his books!"}, {"userName": "K.J.

Derring do, apparent natural malaria resistance, absurd physical courage and endurance, mad as a spoon, obsessed with the Amazon. He mapped the borders between various South American countries, but became obsessed with finding El Dorado and the fabled Lost City of Z. No, really.At the time received wisdom was that the indigenous tribes of the Amazon basin were inferior, weak, savage, blah blah Victorian racism. Fawcett was a man of his time in many bad ways but achieved a kind of doublethink morality that let him treat the locals as human (using radical tactics like 'not shooting them on sight' and 'learning their language' and 'grasping that enslavement and genocide had rather put the survivors off Europeans') and he became convinced that great ancient civilisations had existed in this insanely hostile dangerous 'green hell', as Europeans called it while flocking there for adventure or profit and dying in swathes. I had no idea how horrendously dangerous the Amazon was. Anacondas and maggots and diseases that make your face rot off. Argh. This is the interwoven tale of Fawcett's increasingly obsessed search for a great ancient city in the jungle and his eventual mysterious disappearance, which was a worldwide sensation, and the author's pursuit of evidence about his fate. Generally these sorts of stories can be rather unsatisfying--let's face it, he and his party died and something ate them and we'll never know more--but this one manages an ending that I found magnificent (probably because I was coming from a position of total ignorance of the entire topic but hey). A really enjoyable, engaging read of a vanished civilisation, by which I mean crazed Edwardian explorers obviously."}, {"userName": "Matthew Quann", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22699228-matthew-quann", "userReview": "A question for my nonfiction-loving friends: what is it you love about nonfiction?I ask this question not because I have an inherent dislike for the factual, more that I find fiction much more compelling, readable, and entertaining. It\u2019s why I\u2019ve switched to taking in the bulk of my nonfiction through audio: I just find it easier to get through in that medium. Still, I like to take the occasional foray into reading my nonfiction. With The Lost City of Z, then, I\u2019m confused as to what I make of the whole experience.On one hand, the story is wild in every sense of the word. Grann chose well in his subject as Fawcett\u2019s obsession over a hidden city in the Amazon is compulsively readable. Unfortunately, I found I was taken out of the story by the endless exposition. Hey, I get it. This is a superbly researched and probably hella accurate book, but I\u2019m not pulled in by tidbits unveiling whose journal documented Fawcett\u2019s journey, I just want to read about the journey. Despite the fact that this book caused me to struggle with my relationship to nonfiction, I was rather taken with the concept. In fact, I think if I had listened to this book rather than read it, I\u2019d be all over it. Grann brings the exploratory culture of the early 1900s to life through tales of warm weather, mysterious jungle, and some truly gnarly infectious diseases. Fawcett\u2019s slow circle of the drain towards toxic obsession is also really interesting. We get to see the man take dangerous and almost superhuman treks into the wilderness with an almost blatant disregard for those who come with him. My favourite sections were those in which Grann tells his parallel tale of discovering Fawcett and developing his own obsessions about the explorer\u2019s unknown fate. It was these passages that kept me turning the pages between brief tedium. Throughout the whole book, Grann maintains an objective style that is to the point and well-organized.So, overall, I\u2019m a little bummed out about this one. I had really been looking forward to reading it, but I found it slow and it took me way longer to read than I had anticipated. I\u2019ll be checking out more of Grann\u2019s work through Audible though, since I am impressed with his thorough research even if I wasn\u2019t always entertained by it."}, {"userName": "Bruce", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/897874-bruce", "userReview": "Two stars is probably generous. The rating stems from having known but little about the Amazon rainforest from an experiential point of view. Had I even taken more than a few trips to the National Zoo's only-slightly-muggy version largely without free-roaming pestilence, my rating would probably have been lower. So expectations and foreknowledge are everything here. The more you already know about what a godforsaken wasteland the Amazon is (from a nontropical, industrialized, rocking-chair, artisanal beer-swilling perspective), the weaker I imagine this book will appear.On that note, perhaps you're interested in reading about the exciting new disoveries that analysis of satellite imagery and carbon dating combined with sympathetic boots on the ground are lending to the field of pre-Columbian anthropology in the Americas. This is not that book. That book, referenced here only at page 284, is apparently  Charles Mann's 1491 and one which I look forward to reading at some point.Perhaps your interests are less expansive, limited to  Michael Heckenberger's work with and in proximity to the Kuikuro and Kalapalo tribes in the Amazonian Xingu region, presumably near to Colonel Percy Harrison Fawcett\u2019s last-known whereabouts in his quest for the burg whose romantic name The Lost City of Z serves as the title of this book. You know, a book documenting a theory that represents a paradigm shift away from the 20th century view of Amazonia as a \u201ccounterfeit paradise\u201d incapable of sustaining population density sufficient to yield a complex culture. Well, this is not that book, either. That book, referenced here a mere four pages from the end of his narrative at page 273, is Heckenberger\u2019s own work called  The Ecology of Power and has been described by archaeologists and geographers (as related by David Grann) as \u201cextraordinary,\u201d \u201cmonumental,\u201d \u201ctransformative,\u201d and \u201cearth-shattering,\u201d which sounds worthy of at least a browse.Perhaps..., perhaps really you\u2019re a fan of quirky travel, adventure, and outdoorsy exotica of the type to be found in  Douglas Adams\u2019 amusing  Last Chance to See or  Jon Krakauer\u2019s harrowing exposes of human folly and hubris  Into the Wild or  Into Thin Air and hoping to find here a biography of intrepid Edwardian explorer Fawcett that will match  Adam Hochschild\u2019s telling of Lord Stanley\u2019s disturbing exploits in the Belgian Congo in  King Leopold\u2019s Ghost. Alas, none of those terrific books are this one, either.In fact, it\u2019s hard to say what this book is, as David Grann doesn\u2019t seem himself to know. Here\u2019s how he opens the book: Preface \u2013 the author is lost and alone deep in the Amazon in pursuit of his story (this is actually not the case, but does self-destructively set the stage for the frustrating futility which the reader will perceive throughout the book). Chapter 1 - introducing Fawsett onboard ship destined for Brazil and what will become his last documented trip into the rainforest in 1925. Chapter 2 \u2013 introducing James and James, Jr. Lynch, wealthy bankers who managed to survive their own \u201cIn Search of\u2026\u201d quest into the Green Hell in 1995 only by ransoming themselves to a hostile kidnapping tribe (give \u2018em a hand, folks, as they will be returning only once later in this story in a cameo role). Now here comes Chapter 3, melodramatically surtitled, \u201cThe Search Begins\u201d (for what? the dimly-charted border between Bolivia and Brazil? Ninety-year old undocumented human remains which in the best of conditions would surely have vanished within the first decade of disappearance? the fact that water is wet, heat hot, and indigenous cultures mercilessly exploited and victimized? quel surprise!) and we\u2019re back with the author in first person again as he documents what will ultimately prove to be only his own pointless, journalistic narcissism. Thus bumblingly shifting through multiple points of view, Grann exhausts readers\u2019 patience and sympathy for the characters intended to be their surrogates. As no one even arrives at the jungle until nearly 80 pages in, this book even fails as a member of the nature-as-monster genre.You do pick up some interesting facts about life in the Amazon (via the author\u2019s ultimate encounters with Heckenberger) and a bit of Edwardian-era explorer gossip (via mildew-spotted correspondence with the Royal Geographic Society circa 1911), but nothing worth a book-length investment. I read this in anticipation of a book talk and am now dying to find out why this particular work was chosen. I\u2019m hoping Heckenberger will turn out to be the speaker. If it\u2019s Grann, I won\u2019t waste my lunch hour."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael", "userReview": "Excellent engaging read of a quest of a quest. Grann, a non-athletic journalist in New York, becomes obsessed with the obsession of an early 20th century British explorer, James Fawcett, with the uncharted areas of the Amazon near the boundaries of Bolivia and Brazil. His fame for several expeditions between 1905 and 1915 skyrocketed to nearly Airhart proportions when he disappeared with his son and his friend on a 1925 journey into the vast Mato Grosso wilderness of Brazil in search the ruins of an ancient civilization Fawcett codes as the \"Lost City of Z.\" Rumors of a lost civilization and clues to its general location was what was driving him, not unlike the quest since the time of the Conquistadors for a gold rich El Dorado. Grann deftly charts the origins of Fawcett's character from his Victorian family upbringing, the worship of antecedent explorers like Burton, and an early experience looking for ruins in Ceylon while in the colonial army. His charisma and competence were sufficient to garner the backing of the Royal Geological Society and later the U.S. counterpart. On the ugly side, he had little empathy for anyone in his party who could not keep up with his pace, and he neglected his family. Paradoxically, Fawcett respected the many Indian tribes enough to avoid violent encounters at all costs, yet believed along with nearly all Europeans in their genetic inferiority. Fawcett came to believe that Amazon dwellers achieved a high civilization before the arrival and destructive impact of colonialism and European disease (e.g. Machu Picchu found in 1911). However, he bought into the idea that such civilization had been spread by ancient Phoenicians. Grann's research among Fawcett's letters and descendents led him to pursue his own foray to Brazil to uncover the mysteries of his disappearance and the potential real foundation for the lost city. In this, he was following along in the footsteps of numerous expeditions from the first in 1928 to the last one in 1996, all of which ended in failure and led to perhaps 100 deaths. It is hard to consider that there can be a spoiler to a journalistic memoir, but there is a surprise bit of archaeology at the end. Grann had to know about it, but he kept it tucked away to enhance the drama.

I havent had this many gross out moments since i read \"The Illustrated History of Cannibalism.\" So there is no way you will get to the end of this book without being wildly impressed at the abilities of PJ Fawcett and what he was able to do and when he did it. No radios, violent (rightfully so, btw) Indians, no modern medicine, and yet he helped mapped thousands of miles never mapped before in the middle of a jungle.Likewise you will be equally disgusted to learn about the Rubber Barons and the absolute historically-disregarded genocide of the Amazon's indigenous people. I am really appreciative to Grann for being honest about the limitations of Fawcett, his attempts to break out of his cultural racism, but also how he couldnt quite move away from that limitation, and also for writing about the horrors both of the rubberwars and then WWI.The part I actually liked the most acme right at the end when he discussed the modern archaeology of the Amazon and how its blowing established minds on the subject. For so long it was thought that it was a desert of civilization because the jungle is just too inhospitable, but now we are finding that there was a vast, powerful, and beautiful culture that lived there and spread outwards. Absolutely fascinating. I would have definitely liked if Grann had included more information about the struggles of archaeology in the region, but felt that he did what he could without getting too off topic since his book IS about Fawcett.Overall a good read that I would definitely recommend."}, {"userName": "Ryan", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan", "userReview": "The most dangerous moment in my highly amateurish hiking career was when I fell a little behind my friends and then fell off a mountain path.

I held on tight, calmed myself, and climbed back on to the path.It scared the living daylights out of my mom when I told her, even though I was clearly still alive as I told the story.So you can bet that my mom would not have wanted to know Percy Harrison Fawcett, an English explorer tasked with exploring the Amazon rain forest at the start of the 20th century. Not easy. Any creature not poisonous is probably trying to reproduce in your skin. Fawcett referred to the jungle as hell, but he couldn't stop himself from exploring it repeatedly, relentlessly, and obsessively. By the 1920s, Fawcett became convinced that a lost city had been buried within the forest. He set out in 1921 and again in 1925 to find it, only to disappear in the attempt.What a story!Which is exactly why David Grann sets out to tell Fawcett's tale of obsession in The Lost City of Z.To his credit, Grann has a great eye for details, describing the horrors of the jungle, the arrogance with which the Royal Geographical Society viewed the Amazonian Indians, and the preparations needed to plan an expedition. I also enjoyed his discussion of spiritualism in an age that ostensibly celebrated reason and science. Grann's favorite example, and mine, was Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who was enthusiastic about exploration, invented Sherlock Holmes, and believed wholehearted in psychic mediums. More than anything else, Grann has a great sense of pacing and of narrative. In fact, The Lost City of Z may be the most exciting work of non-fiction that I have ever read.However, perhaps Grann's dedication to the story gets the best of him.For one thing, Grann enters the jungle, which he passes off as obsession (nicely done), but by the end of the book I found myself wondering if it wasn't just a marketing gimmick. This is perhaps unfair, so please let me explain.Ostensibly, Grann enters the jungle to trace Fawcett's route and to find his remains, if possible (about 80 years later). He has also made contact with Michael Heckenberger, an anthropologist studying the Amazon. Grann implies that their meeting is a surprise. And he further confesses his shock that *surprise* there is evidence of a lost civilization after all. Quite frankly, it seems unlikely to me that Grann wouldn't have known of Heckenberger's findings before heading into the jungle. Surely amongst all this obsession he looked up Heckenberger's work before heading to Brazil.But it does make for a good story to suddenly discover, just as Grann is about to return to New York, that there is evidence of an ancient civilization after all.So although I am suspicious of Grann the reporter, I certainly recommend Grann the story teller."}, {"userName": "Jeremy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/869064-jeremy", "userReview": "This is kind of an odd accomplishment: an adventure book that will make you really really glad your not an adventurer.

Skin peels off in sheets, everyone gets malaria, parasites, maggot infections (shudder), gangrene, etc. Trekking through unspoiled tropical jungles is utterly horrifying, you basically just turn yourself into an oozing, walking meal and wait for the rainforest to literally devour you.

The Amazon has so many types of disgusting flesh eating bugs, flesh eating diseases, and flesh eating fish. Ye thought piranhas were bad. Try candiru. Ugh.

Percy was a \u201cBritish geographer, artillery officer, cartographer, archaeologist and explorer of South America.\u201d He became obsessed with finding a lost city in the jungles of Amazon.

What happened to hardened and experienced Percy on that last ill-fated expedition? Author David Grann was determined to solve the centuries old case.Like the book about Antarctic explorers, this tale was full of details about the lengths to which these men would go to protect \u201ctheir\u201d finds and their fame. It also showcases how much effort went into planning and funding an expedition. I found the details of the flora, fauna, and geography of the Amazon to be fascinating. The author even portrays his own trip into the jungle in the name of research.Really the novel is dense with detail and history. It was riveting and seemingly well researched. The only downside I had was the ending which mentioned some interesting new archeology finds in the area of the Kalapalous tribe that may change the entire historical landscape of South America.

As David Grann puts it himself: It\u2019s the great \u201ccounterfeit paradise\u201d. I couldn\u2019t agree more. Amazon will starve you. Amazon will desiccate you. And finally, Amazon will obliterate you. Because, simply put, Amazon doesn\u2019t care for you. It\u2019s a green desert. Unfit for human civilization.Take the example of Colonel Percy Harrison Fawcett. He wanted to make \u201cthe great discovery of the century\u201d by finding the cryptic lost City of Z but instead, the uncaring Amazon rainforest consumed him, his son (Jack) and his son\u2019s friend (Raleigh Rimell). So, \u201cthe great discovery of the century\u201d became infamous as what has often been described as \u201cthe greatest exploration mystery of the twentieth century\u201d\u2014 that is, the mystery of the fate of Percy Fawcett and the whereabouts of the lost City of Z.Many have tried to solve the mystery over the years, but failed.No one could find exactly what happened to Fawcett and certainly no one could find any clues that Z ever existed. But why should it exist? It was really pointless of us to assume right from the start that a civilization could prosper under something as brutal and vainglorious as Amazon. Sure, Grann did made some flimsy attempts by the end of the book by hinting that a civilized colony might have existed in the Amazon in the past, but that didn\u2019t half-convince me.So, one thing I would definitely take away from this book is the fact that, Amazon is the bane of civilization."}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3195534-melanie", "userReview": "3*. Well that was interesting! For most of the book I thought Percy Fawcett (the explorer whom the book is about) was probably a complete wack-a-doodle. At the end of the book, maybe only partially a wack-a-doodle but you do have to be somewhat obsessed to keep going back into that environment looking for a fabled \"Lost City\". I cannot fathom trekking into the Amazon jungle in our times with modern technology let alone in the 1920's when Fawcett did it. It is not a place I would ever desire to experience, just on the bug issue alone! Gross stuff in there!! The book is a bit long in places but overall pretty good.(Why is GR marking everything as read twice when it's only been read once?). Maddening!"}, {"userName": "Melania &#x1f352;", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23622394-melania-x1f352", "userReview": "3,65/5"}], "description": "A grand mystery reaching back centuries. A sensational disappearance that made headlines around the world. A quest for truth that leads to death, madness or disappearance for those who seek to solve it. The Lost City of Z is a blockbuster adventure narrative about what lies beneath the impenetrable jungle canopy of the Amazon.After stumbling upon a hidden trove of diaries, New Yorker writer David Grann set out to solve \"the greatest exploration mystery of the 20th century\": What happened to the British explorer Percy Fawcett & his quest for the Lost City of Z?In 1925, Fawcett ventured into the Amazon to find an ancient civilization, hoping to make one of the most important discoveries in history. For centuries Europeans believed the world's largest jungle concealed the glittering kingdom of El Dorado. Thousands had died looking for it, leaving many scientists convinced that the Amazon was truly inimical to humans. But Fawcett, whose daring expeditions inspired Conan Doyle's The Lost World, had spent years building his scientific case. Captivating the imagination of millions round the globe, Fawcett embarked with his 21-year-old son, determined to prove that this ancient civilisation--which he dubbed Z--existed. Then his expedition vanished. Fawcett's fate, & the tantalizing clues he left behind about Z, became an obsession for hundreds who followed him into the uncharted wilderness. For decades scientists & adventurers have searched for evidence of Fawcett's party & the lost City of Z. Countless have perished, been captured by tribes or gone mad. As Grann delved ever deeper into the mystery surrounding Fawcett's quest, & the greater mystery of what lies within the Amazon, he found himself, like the generations who preceded him, being irresistibly drawn into the jungle's green hell. His quest for the truth & discoveries about Fawcett's fate & Z form the heart of this complexly enthralling narrative.", "title": "The Lost City of Z: A Tale of Deadly Obsession in the Amazon", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3398625-the-lost-city-of-z", "average": 3.86, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320487318l/3398625.jpg", "reviews": 5261, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1431785.David_Grann", "name": "David Grann"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "History", "Adventure", "Travel", "Biography"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3398625-the-lost-city-of-z", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6443394-the-lost-city-of-z", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9809410-the-lost-city-of-z", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10945519-a-cidade-perdida-de-z", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29496076-killers-of-the-flower-moon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7150397-the-devil-sherlock-holmes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7321728-un-crime-parfait", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10286750-trial-by-fire", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25099637-the-yankee-comandante", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
