Her parents are the managers of an elegant hotel, the Rosemount. Ever summer, wealthy guests come to stay at the hotel. Zanna's parents have insisted that she begin to work in the hotel so that she can learn about it, hoping she will want to manage the hotel someday. But Zanna would much rather be a famous detective like her Uncle Bruce, who lives in Boston.As the summer season starts, Zanna expects that as usual nothing much will happen, so she practices her detective skills by observing the guests. Then, during a terrible thunderstorm, Maddie, a little girl staying at the hotel with her family disappears. Zanna is sure she saw Maddie being led out of the hotel during the storm, but because she is a child, no one will believe her - not even her idolized Uncle Bruce, whi arrives from Boston to investigate the case. So Zanna decides she must investigate on her own, to try to solve the mystery and save Maddie.I don't read quite as many middle grade books anymore, though I do read some, but I had to read this one because I loved Angie Frazier's debut young adult novel, Everlasting. And I am so glad I decided to! Zanna is such a fun and determined heroine and the unusual historical setting was described so well. If you know a young girl who loves historical fiction or mysteries this would be a great book to recommend, and even if you are older, you might enjoy it too, just like I did!"}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2276205-kelly", "userReview": "(3.5 stars) Suzanna Snow\u2019s parents own a luxury hotel, the Rosemount, and are training Zanna in the family business. But Zanna wants to emulate her uncle, a celebrated detective, instead. When a little girl goes missing from the Rosemount, with Zanna the only witness to the kidnapping, her interest in sleuthing becomes more than theoretical. Trouble is, no one believes an eleven-year-old, not even her famous uncle\u2026The Midnight Tunnel is an engaging whodunit for middle-grade readers, starring a brave and resourceful heroine. As befits a book for \u2014 and about \u2014 a preteen, it\u2019s pretty gentle in terms of the degree of bodily harm Angie Frazier inflicts upon the characters. The situations in the book are spooky, not gory. The mystery has just the right degree of complexity for the target audience. (Adult readers will probably overcomplicate it. I sure did. I imagined a big tangled solution involving secret parentage, and had to keep reminding myself it was a kids\u2019 book and wouldn\u2019t include the kinds of scandals I\u2019m used to in adult and YA mysteries.)What stands out most to an older reader is the issue of socioeconomic class. Like Frazier\u2019s previous novel, the young adult Everlasting, The Midnight Tunnel features close relationships between young people of disparate class backgrounds. We\u2019re dealing with friendships and possible crushes here, rather than Everlasting\u2019s grand romance, but the theme is still present. Because of her youth and the fact that her parents assign her menial tasks as part of her training, Zanna identifies with the other young people who work as servants at the Rosemount. She faces cognitive dissonance when she sees that society treats these kids very differently than it treats her. None of this is delivered via sledgehammer, though, but flows organically with the story.While Frazier seems to be setting Suzanna Snow up as a magic-free series, I believe it will be enjoyed by fans of R.L. LaFevers\u2019 Theodosia Throckmorton series and vice versa. I wish there had been more books like this when I was a kid. I always enjoy following a bright heroine through a rich historical setting \u2014 especially if there\u2019s a mystery involved too.

I have been a fan of Angie Frazier and her ability to weave a stunning historical setting since her young adult book Everlasting, and she's done it again with The Midnight Tunnel. Angie's masterful skill at creating both a lush setting and compelling characters is on full display in The Midnight Tunnel, and I can't wait to share this engaging mystery with my little Nancy Drew fan.Set at the turn of the century in New Brunswick, The Midnight Tunnel is the first in a series of books about Suzanna Snow, a bright, spirited heroine with big dreams. I loved the Anne of Green Gables feel to the story with the Canadian setting and Suzanna's charming personality. She's being trained by her mother to be a proper lady at the Rosemount, the exclusive hotel her parents manage, but Suzanna has far grander dreams than waiting on rich people for the rest of her life--Suzanna wants to be a detective. Her aspirations and daydreams get her in a few scrapes, but Suzanna comes out shining and proves she's got the instinct and skills to be a stellar detective.Angie Frazier's writing is descriptive and engaging with an intriguing mystery to keep you guessing. Younger readers may not understand all of the descriptions, but preteens and smart girls will embrace and love this new Nancy Drew for their generation. The Midnight Tunnel offers a fresh new voice for middle graders and will have young readers clamoring for the next installment."}, {"userName": "Lillian", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1627666-lillian", "userReview": "If I picked my stars based on my guess of how the target audience would feel about the book I'd give this one 4 or 5 stars.

If Suzanne were given one wish, she would most definitely wish to be a detective, because not only is her uncle the infamous Bruce Snow, Boston's most prized detective, but she also has an uncanny talent for sleuthing. Unfortunately, given her surroundings and the time, she's unable to gain much experience in her desired field...that is until a girl goes missing from her parent's hotel. Recruiting her two trustworthy friends, Isaac and Lucy, Suzanne's ready to find the missing girl as well as the solution to this mystifying puzzle. However, what happens when her famous uncle makes a grand entrance with a surprising guest? Better yet, when given the biggest clue to her the case, will she be able to solve it finally- even if it means telling on a fellow friend? Only time and more pages will tell in this fast-paced mystery that sure to leave any reader questioning the case right along with Suzanne.One of my favorite parts of this novel would have to be the characters. For example, Suzanne Snow is very much the next Nancy Drew. Smart and talented, she\u2019s one girl who will go to any length to bring justice to the world, even if it means taking some slippery and dangerous turns along the way. I also adored the addition of Isaac and Lucy, her two friends. Isaac is not only a pre-teen angler but also one to bring some hilarious lines as well as heart into the story, while Lucy is a sweet yet cunning girl full of her own mysterious secrets. Angie Frazier also did a great job of making this mystery a lot of fun as well as enjoyable for nearly any age group. I loved the way she had the storyline keep me on the tip of my toes and making my own assumptions right along with Suzanne for the majority of the story. More importantly, I enjoyed the way Angie brought the setting of this alive as well. From the hotel guests to detailed setting descriptions, it was easy to imagine everything as it was taking place.Full of page-flipping fun, Suzanne Snow is on the track to becoming the Nancy Drew of this generation, and I simply cannot wait to see where Angie takes her story next.

Angie Frazier aims The Midnight Tunnel at the middle grade reader, but what I loved is that she didn't sacrifice anything to do that. This book has tons of crossover appeal, and anyone who loves a good mystery coupled with historical fiction will fall in love. Beware the rambling my friends, so it begins.First let me tell you why I loved Suzanna so much. Her mother and father want her to be a well behaved young woman. They hope that she will follow in their footsteps and want to run the inn. Unfortunately for them, and fortunately for us, Suzanna has a much different path in mind! She wants to be a world renown detective like her Uncle Bruce. For that, I love her. She's a little bit rebel, and a whole lot of trouble without meaning to be. I instantly fell in love with her wit, her inability to stay away from trouble, and her downright brilliant deductions! Young or old, readers will definitely find something to connect to in her character.In terms of story, as I mentioned above there is an entire mystery wrapped up in these pages! When a young guest goes missing, Suzanna takes it upon herself to unravel the mystery. Those of you who are older readers might be worried that this book will be too \"young\" for you. Let me tell you this. I read mystery novels and I generally solve mystery novels about half way through. This one? I was guessing until almost the very end. As I said, Angie Frazier doesn't sacrifice one bit for her audience. I like that she doesn't find it necessary to \"dumb things down\" for a middle grade reader. Utterly fantastic. I wish I could say more, but I've already had to delete so much to keep this spoiler free.I ended up having to put The Midnight Tunnel down for a few days last week to take care of other commitments, and I tell you that it killed me to do it! I kept wondering how everything was going to end. What Angie Frazier has written here is a stunning mystery that is wrapped up in a very middle grade friendly package. I enjoyed each and every minute of this book and I can't wait to read the next one! I know Suzanna will keep on doing her detective work, and I'll be there to follow along."}, {"userName": "Alan", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2272354-alan", "userReview": "ATOS Book Level:\t5.4Interest Level:\tMiddle Grades (MG 4-8)AR Points:\t9.0Lexile: 800L \tWord Count:\t59290A fun mystery series especially for middle school girls, it's set in the early 1900's.

Nothing ignites her passion, though, like a challenging investigation-- she believes she takes after her Uncle Bruce, a famous Bostonian detective. The summer of 1904 is shaping up to be all too predictable, when the young child of a wealthy couple staying at the hotel disappears. Search parties fail to locate Maddie, and Uncle Bruce is called in. Looking forward to sharing her observations and theories with her uncle, whom she has not seen in years, Suzanna is crushed to find that he has no use for the opinions of a \"child,\" and that his investigative approach is more show than substance. With the help of Uncle Bruce's apprentice, Will, Suzanna is determined to track down young Maddie.

There's something about an intrepid young detective that sparks my interest now. I don't know if it's the danger, the smarts or the twists and turns these young ladies (for it always seems to be a young ladies) face that are reaching out to me or if it's something else entirely, but I've just about turn around into a mystery convert. The latest young lady to take the stage is eleven-year-old Suzanna Snow, star of Angie Frazier's The Midnight Tunnel.It's 1904, and another summer has come for Suzanna, of Zanna, at the Rosemount Hotel, which her parents manage. This summer, Zanna is apprenticed in the kitchen, but she'd much rather be out and about, taking notations in her notebook, honing her skills as a detective, just like her famous Uncle Bruce, who lives and works in Boston. Even though she takes notice of every small little thing (and you always know those small details will come back), Zanna hardly dreams that she'll soon be in the middle of an honest to goodness mystery when a young girl, a guest at the hotel, goes missing one stormy night. Zanna thinks she saw Maddie being taken away on the night in question, but she can't get any of the adults to take her seriously. So of course, this calls for some on the side investigation. Aided by Will, her Uncle Bruce's nephew, Zanna follows clue to clue through to the logical conclusion and, of course, saves the day.What I like most about Zanna is her willingness to bend the rules to get what she wants or needs. She's not reckless or hurtful, just independent, like sleuths Flavia de Luce and Enola Holmes before her (ok, Flavia is occasionally hurtful, I'll give you that). She respects her parents, and tries to obey her mother's rules of \"social taboos\", but sometimes a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do. I liked her indignation when the search for Maddie slows down and people start to lose interest in the little girl's safety. Zanna's got spirit, yes she does. The setting for this mystery is another high point. With open beaches, long, dark tunnels and junk rooms filled with debris, the locations provided an excellent atmospheric backdrop to the action. What Frazier's really done is given us a solid mystery that's easy to follow, even when it has many balls up in the air, and a delightful new character to add to the pantheon of great girl detectives. I look forward to more Suzanna Snow mysteries, as I certainly hope there will be more to come."}, {"userName": "Dan Rogers", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4689500-dan-rogers", "userReview": "Suzanna \"Zanna\" Snow is an only child in a family which runs a posh hotel in Loch Harbor, New Brunswick shortly after the turn of the 20th century. Zanna is curious, inquisitive, and not the least interested in learning how to run the hotel which her parents hope that one day she will take over from them. She would rather become a famous detective like her father's younger brother, the infamous Bruce Snow of Boston. Little does Zanna realize that her Uncle Bruce doesn't have the same high regard for her that she has for him, but she will soon find out firsthand. When a 7 year old girl disappears from the Rosemount Hotel one stormy night, Zanna begins to investigate. Soon, her Uncle Bruce is called in to solve the mystery. With no regard for her hero worship, Bruce can't be bothered with meddling children in his work. So, Zanna must keep her investigating to herself until such time as she is ready to reveal what she has learned, and then she has to hope that at least one sensible adult will listen to what she has to say.The author has crafted a story which is believable, enjoyable, and kept me always wanting to read on. The only challenge I found with the story is that occasionally I got confused by all the characters and who was who. This was only a minor distraction and certainly did not detract from my enjoyment of the tale. I found Zanna to be a likeable character who I would have loved to have had as a friend as I was growing up. Although she occasionally acts before thinking things through all turns out well in the end. With enough suspense, drama, and mystery to keep the reader engaged this book will be an outstanding addition to my classroom library.

It isn\u2019t too obvious and everything ties in together very nicely. It also isn\u2019t too complicated, which I\u2019m counting as a good thing here since it is geared for younger children. It reminded me of the Mandie mysteries by Lois Gladys Leppard.Suzanna is an easy protagonist to like, with a few humorous asides and generally amusing behavior. I also really liked Will, who wasn\u2019t set up as a rival as I expected when they were first introduced. The \u201crival\u201d is getting a bit too common in YA and children\u2019s books these days, although it makes for some nice conflict and antagonism, etc. so I was happy that Frazier didn\u2019t go that route (for Will, anyway).But I am starting to strongly dislike the \u201cgirl rebels against propriety\u201d plot. For once, can we have a girl who actually decides to follow propriety instead of treating it as some type of Bad Thing that is Stifling Her? Granted, Suzanna is about 12 years old, but not all 12-year-olds are rebellious. Let\u2019s actually follow early-1900-norms and traditions when we write books about the early 1900s instead of basing everything on our modern experiences and sentiments (I\u2019m not saying that nobody was rebellious in this way in the early 1900s. I\u2019m saying that we should stop treating it like every girl rebelled against the social conventions of that day because most girls probably didn\u2019t, and our writing should reflect that).Overall, The Midnight Tunnel is a mystery that many younger (and older) readers will enjoy. The characters are likeable and the mystery itself is suspenseful and not always obvious.

The mystery twists and turns, presenting a page-turning read for all ages."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3638126-katie", "userReview": "The Midnight Tunnel was an absolutely amazing book. I would have never picked it up if I hadn't loved Everlasting, her previous book. I'm not a fan of middle grade novels, but this\u2026this was just awesome.Suzanna or Zanna, as she likes to be called, was just as great as the book its self. She was such a feisty girl and so likable. I loved how she wrote things down in her notebook and then referred back to them later to solve the mystery. Oh, Zanna is my kind of girl! And she had such a unique voice!One of my favorite things about this book was that it wasn't toned, or dumbed down for middle grade readers. And I love that when authors write. I could just go nuts about the mystery. It was SO good! I took me awhile to figure things out, seriously Zanna is smarter than I am. And the mystery was very complex, and kept you engaged the entire book. It was so surprising when it was resolved, I did not expect anything about this book.All I can say is Angie Frazier scores again! I will always read her books, no matter what. And I can't wait to see what Suzanna Snow does next. She will always be welcome."}, {"userName": "shadowkissed heartrender", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28842416-shadowkissed-heartrender", "userReview": "Thank you Scholastic for giving me this book. In my school, there is this program where when you reach 40 books read and quizzes answered, they'll give you a free book. I have reached more than forty to be honest, and I was given the opportunity to choose a book from a small collection. Sad to say, the selection held nothing on me. They were all suited for middle schoolers, not teenagers. I was with my friend at that time, and she chose this book for me. She reasoned that it was the thickest of the bunch. I was disappointed with the choices that I went along with it. I was glad that I received a free book, but I wasn't overly excited when I got this book along with a pin that read 'Book Fanatic!' I was kind of expecting I'd get a cool YA book, but I'll take what I can get. Moving on to the review... The book was slow in the first half. I only read it to pass the time during my Graduation practice, and the book ate away the minutes. It got better when I reached the second half of the book. It wasn't all that bad, I guess..."}, {"userName": "Katharine Ott", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4928619-katharine-ott", "userReview": "\"The Midnight Tunnel - by Angie Frazier, published in 2011. Taking place just after the turn of the century in 1904 New Brunswick, the action in this nice middle-grade novel all takes place at the summer hotel operated by the parents of eleven-year-old Zanna. She fancies herself a detective with hopes of someday assisting her real-life detective uncle in Boston, and each chapter begins with a few amusing sentences from the journal she carries everywhere. Of course a real mystery steps right up and keeps everyone busy trying to solve the whodunit.Frazier has a comfortable, readable style that should appeal to readers ready for a meatier chapter book. You wonder, speculate and agonize along with Zanna, and the action sequences are exciting. The friendly spirit of the book is epitomized by the Chapter Ten journal entry: \"Detective Rule: Treat everyone as a suspect - friends, family, and crabby fishermen alike.\""}], "description": "Can Suzanna Snow solve the case before it's too late?A girl's gone missing.
