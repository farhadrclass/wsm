The plot wasn't good. The writing was worse. The characters were not endearing. The protagonist is dumb and impossible for me to root for.I feel that the author didn't really think everything through. The United States Army built a fortified bunker for Captain Lee Harden, but built it such that the only entrance was from inside the basement of Harden's home. And this bunker did not include any surveillance, which left Harden virtually blind any time he wanted to leave.Here's another example: Harden felt that satellite phones would be useless because \"it was likely that the satellites they used would fall out of orbit without human intervention.\" At the same time, however, his GPS device was \"his bread and butter, the life blood of his mission.\"I can't see Harden as a hero. I can deal with his naivety and his true believerism, but I cannot deal with his never ending stupidity. Digging graves was careless enough, but attempting to hole up for a night with a group of survivors in a house whose patio door had been destroyed was too ridiculous to take seriously. But then it got worse because Harden then led the survivors to spend a night sleeping in the cab of a pickup truck with a guy who had been bitten! Of this arrangement, the author wrote, \"Their dreams were dark and hazy and filled with fear and hope. They slept unaware that fate would not allow all of them to reach Timber Creek alive.\" Of course not\u2026one of them was already known to be infected! Come on, man. This book was too much.Also, the author could have used a better editor. I understand that not everyone can afford a top-notch editor, but any author can have at least one friend who knows how to construct a sentence so that it actually conveys the author's intended idea or can let the author know that he failed to actually introduce two of his characters.The premise was good, but the execution left a lot to be desired. Just not good."}, {"userName": "Dirk Grobbelaar", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3102740-dirk-grobbelaar", "userReview": "Standard Zombie Apocalypse fare, but deftly handled. If you\u2019ve ever wondered what The Walking Dead would be like if Rick had been better prepared for the apocalypse, this will be right up your alley. Hands caked in dried blood reached for him.Speaking of prepared. This may also be the main Achilles heel of the story, if you were inclined to find fault. The protagonist survives the \u201cend-of-the-world\u201d event by being sequestered in a bunker by the U.S. government as part of a contingency plan for continuing governance...Was his mission even feasible?In that moment it felt ridiculous, outlandish, and impossible....which seems sillier the more you think about it. It comes across as more of an arrangement of convenience for the author to draw on as the story progresses. All being what it is, however, I'm inclined to give this book the benefit of the doubt because it is a rather atmospheric zombie romp.Bile rose in the back of his throat, and only after the bitter taste hit his tongue did he notice the overpowering stench. Like rot and body odor and feces.Some of the real Horror to be found here is generated by the fact that these \u201czombies\u201d aren\u2019t actually dead. Sometimes they even experience moments of clarity and conscience, which lends an eerie edge to proceedings. Imagine coming to your senses only to realize you have just killed your loved ones and... well, we all know how these zombie stories go. The stuff nightmares are made of.There was a dark shape behind the dead man, moving up fast.One of the book\u2019s biggest strengths is the technical aspects of the protagonist\u2019s actions. It would appear the author has some knowledge of military protocol and tactics. Or, he has at least read the handbook. All said, the action sequences make for visceral, realistic (given the circumstances) and exciting reading.By the way, the standard tropes apply:1. Be (potentially) more afraid of your fellow humans than of flesh-eating freaks!2. Headshots, headshots, headshots!3. Be quiet \u2013 it\u2019s the noise that attracts them!4. The zombie horde!5. No good deed goes unpunished![He] felt like he was running faster than he\u2019d ever run. He felt like the ground was moving underneath him faster than his feet could keep up, like the whole world was a giant treadmill turned up as high as it could go.In the end, I found this book to be very exciting rather than outright scary. Is there a genre like Action Horror? Expect sweaty palms. The Remaining isn\u2019t a world changing literary achievement, but I would lie if I said I didn\u2019t enjoy it. In closing I'll just mention that the author holds the reader hostage with a doozy of a cliffhanger (unasked for, if you ask me), so you may want the next book close by when you read this.Both of them looked out into the darkness.In the sterling moonlight, the shapes were hard to make out among all the trees, but [he] could see the movement, distinctly human, and distinctly predatory."}, {"userName": "Figgy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5056662-figgy", "userReview": "I'm sorry, I really am, but I'm going to have to call it quitsies on this book. I don't like DNFing books, I've only done it a handful of times in my life, but I really can't go on. For the last twelve days I have struggled to make myself read more of this book, averaging out at about 5 pages per day. 60 pages in total for those of you playing at home. I've read 400 to 500 page novels in the space of a couple of days(which, in all honesty, would probably equal one day, had I not been at work for 8+ hours of each of those days, and had to sleep because of said work).But nothing about this novel grabbed me at all. Except, of course, for the blurb when I requested it from NetGalley. Now, I love zombies. I love them just as much as the next girl. No, it\u2019s actually a lot more than the average girl; I\u2019m kinda obsessed with zombies. You slap the zombie label on something (oh, damn, now I want a zombie label), and I am THERE.But this was so\u2026 not happening. The Remaining differs from other zombie books in that the main character actually knows about the virus, knows the cause of the zombie infection, and is told what to expect from the infected long before he ever finds himself in a situation where he might come face to face with any.He\u2019s had army training, and he\u2019s skilled at surviving, but sometimes he doesn\u2019t think things through, and some other aspects of the story just didn\u2019t make sense. There are 48 one person + pet bunkers (because pets are suggested to stop people from going crazy while locked underground for what could be months). This program is not known about outside a super top secret department, and they had to have 48 bunkers to minimise the chances of other departments noticing that there was some money scraped off the top for undisclosed operations. Because 48 x 1 human 1 pet bunkers is so much more cost effective than 24 x 2 human 1 pet bunkers, or 12 x 4 person 1 pet bunkers\u2026 Each of these bunkers has access to the internet/satellites, but it goes against protocol for the people in the bunkers to talk to each other. They could be punished for doing so without permission. To an extent I can understand this, insomuch as one person in a bunker freaking out might email other people and start them panicking too. But on the other side of things, wouldn\u2019t letting them communicate with each other help stop the whole cabin fever issue, and also help them to coordinate their mission, should the zombie shit hit the proverbial fan?I especially found it hard to believe that once Lee KNEW that there was likely no government around, having come face to face with a zombie and seen the deserted world outside before retreating to his bunker, he STILL didn't think \"Hey, I should contact the other people and give them a heads up.\"The mission of these people is to gather survivors and rebuild, I guess? But, by the sounds of it, there are no WOMEN in any of those 48 bunkers. Let\u2019s say your Worst Case Scenario isn\u2019t ACTUALLY the WCS, and everyone except those people in bunkers becomes a zombie. How the hell are they supposed to rebuild society to any major extent if they don\u2019t have the option to reproduce, YOU MORONS?Aaaaaaaaaaanywho. Then Lee is looking at the supplies he is going to take with him when he embarks on his mission properly, and he puts the satellite phones in his bag, even though he doubts they\u2019ll continue to work forever, as the satellites will likely fall out of orbit due to there being no one to keep an eye on them. But then he talks about how important his GPS is. You DO know how a GPS works, don\u2019t you, Lee? There were certain things about the first 60 pages of this book that really annoyed me, but mostly I was overwhelmed with boredom, and by the time the zombies started showing up, I was completely out of fucks to give. It\u2019s likely I will go back and try and read this book one day, if only to know how it all turns out, but I can\u2019t drag this out for the further six weeks it would take me at the current rate, and I don\u2019t see myself recommending it to anyone.

Unfortunately I am not one (don't hurt me!)."}, {"userName": "Timothy Mayer", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2206481-timothy-mayer", "userReview": "The Remaining by D. J. Molles is a digital publishing sensation. It has more than 900 reviews on Amazon and is being filmed as a movie. People who say the Internet hasn\u2019t done much for new authors need to watch this star rise. Author D. J. Molles, has made great use of the Internet to get his book talked-about. You can check out his blog here or Facebook page here. The Remaining is also the best example of TEOTWAWKI (The End OF The World As We Know It) fiction on the market.Appropriately, the novel begins in an underground bunker. Capt. Lee Harden, United States Army, belongs to a secretive project known as Project Hometown. The government has constructed secure bunkers below ordinary looking buildings in each of the lower 48 states. In the event of a national emergency, an operative will be sequestered in the bunker with secret orders only to be opened if there is no communication with their superior after 48 hours. Each operative, known as a \u201ccoordinator\u201d, is to remain in the bunker for 30 days after the last communication from their superior. The bunker has everything needed to keep the operative safe and secure for the duration of the emergency.Harden is in the bunker this time with his trained dog, Tango. He\u2019s been sent down into it because a new plague has broken out. This is not the first time he\u2019s been sent down in the bunker and Harden expects the whole emergency will end shortly, as it usually does. Shortly after his descent, most of the news feeds begin to go out. All he can do is stare at a plaque which reads \u201cThe Only Easy Day Was Yesterday\u201d. After waiting the required length of time, he opens the box where his orders are stored, finds a thumb-drive in it, and loads the drive on his computer.What he discovers is the nature of the plague. Known as Febrile Urocanic Reactive Yersinia (FURY), a new bacterial disease is raging across the United States. Incubation is within 24 to 48 hours. There is no known cure. Victims begin to loose their ability to reason and turn into predatory animals, attacking anything in sight. In essence, the Zombie Apocalypse has begun (although in all fairness, the world \u201czombie\u201d is never used in the book).His mission has begun: link-up with groups of survivors and restore order.The novel spends a lot of time discussing the various weapons and supplies Harden takes with him to the surface. The author has done his homework extensively in this area. For instance, did you know a polymer magazine is prefered for an M4 assault rifle because it can carry 30 rounds and won\u2019t jam? I didn\u2019t. Finally, before the 30-day mark, he suits up in his chemical warfare gear and leaves the bunker.He\u2019s nearly killed by a screaming infected with a knife, but manages to take her down. Mofett is good at foreshadowing the action, such as noting the area around the house was trampled, which should have warned Harden. He does learn a valuable lesson: the infected have incredible strength and won\u2019t respond to pain. The best way to take them down is a shot to the head.The remainder of the book has Harden on the move constantly, helping people when he can. Not only are the infected a threat, but the world is running rampant with warlords and savages. He barely manages to save the life of a young boy whose father is gunned down by crazed rednecks. Again, the detail in Harden\u2019s techniques on taking out an opposing force are incredibly detailed.The novel never lets up. Just as soon as you think Harden and the survivors he\u2019s helping are in for a moment of peace, something else attacks. It can be mobs of the infected or warlords with captured weapons. This book is relentless. I read it in one day. It never fails to hold your attention.The author has some insight into combat as well:\"\u2026A gunfight was a game of chessthat happened in the span of a few short seconds. You didn\u2019t have time tothink, so you made your moves and hoped your training and instincts were betterthan the other guy\u2019s. At that brief second in time, Lee knew the initiative andthe advantage had gone to his attacker and that if he waited too long, hewouldn\u2019t be able to get it back.\"There are two more books in the series. Molles is writing the fourth one currently. He\u2019s also announced he may end the series at book five. The Remaining is an excellent first book from a new author. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Mogsy (MMOGC)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4379514-mogsy-mmogc", "userReview": "4 of 5 stars at The BiblioSanctum http://bibliosanctum.blogspot.com/201...The Remaining is a great zombie book. Originally self-published in 2012, it quickly became an internet bestseller before being picked up by Orbit, and there\u2019s a damn good reason for that. By now you\u2019ve probably seen a lot of the positive reviews it has garnered, though I\u2019m willing to bet few of them have praised this story for being terribly original. But does that make this a bad book? Heck no. In fact, I would argue that its devotion to the classic zombie survival-horror tradition is a massive part of the appeal.The Walking Dead fans, this one would be right up your alley. No joke. The \u201czombies\u201d in this book might not be the traditional mindless shambling hordes we\u2019re used to seeing \u2013 the victims of the FURY plague are still capable of talking and strategizing up to a point before the virus degrades their brains (which makes them even more terrifying) \u2013 but the overall spirit and style of the narrative is still the same. It\u2019s not out to knock you off your feet with any new or unusual or experimental ideas, but if its goal is to provide a fast-moving, action-packed and entertaining zombie story then I must say it has succeeded rather swimmingly.Here\u2019s what you basically need to know: the main character of The Remaining is a US Army captain named Lee Harden, who as part of a secret government program is sequestered in his bunker after the sudden outbreak of a new deadly and infectious virus. It\u2019s not the first time this has happened. Lee and about four dozen other soldiers like him (one for every state) are placed in their bunkers every time the country experiences an emergency of national crisis. If the government falls, their job is to come out after the bunker, take stock of the situation and try to gather survivors in order to rebuild. But things in the past have never gone so far or gotten this bad before. When the lockdown period passes without an all-clear or any further instructions from his superiors, Lee emerges from the bunker and prepares to start his mission.As a character, Lee took a while to grow on me \u2013 but he did. Strangely, the moment came when I was finally able to appreciate his faults. To understand, you must realize the few chapters really tried my patience. The entire lockdown period featured Lee being in denial, going back and forth between his decisions and second guessing his instructions. And then there were those long and wearying paragraphs about his guns. The deadline came and went. I kept tapping my foot waiting for him to stop describing the contents of his impressive arsenal, get his waffling butt out there and actually put all that stuff to good use on some hapless Infected.Then I realized, I was being too harsh. Dude is stuck in a bunker. Not knowing what\u2019s going on because he\u2019s cut off from all communication. No human interaction at all because it\u2019s just him and his dog. If the world outside has indeed gone to hell in a hand basket, he\u2019s probably also scared to death of the responsibility waiting for him on the other side of that tunnel.So maybe I was being a tad unfair to poor Lee. And really, what a shame it would have been if he was just another archetypal action hero, full of empty bravado rushing out headfirst to save the world? Lee is more realistic this way, even if he did end up doing some questionable things. But then, who wouldn\u2019t make a mistake in the middle of a zombie apocalypse? Contrary to what all the zombie survival guides want you to believe, there's no instruction manual for stuff like this. Wrong decisions or no, Lee has to make some pretty tough calls as well. The guy has a good heart, but he's sure as hell also capable of showing no mercy to those who don\u2019t deserve it. I love that in his character.Bottom line, if you\u2019re a fan of type of zombie apocalypse survival movies that Hollywood does so well, this is that in book form. After a relatively sedate start, the novel picks up and will not slow down, with always some kind of disaster or new setback waiting around the corner for the characters to overcome. No other bells and whistles or fancy-schmancy embellishments, just pure zombie fiction fun."}, {"userName": "Julianne", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5927516-julianne", "userReview": "*Contains very minor spoilers*Unfortunately, the technical errors in this book were so rampant that they ruined the story for me.There are vocabulary and grammatical errors (\"anyways\" should be \"anyway;\" he vs. him, etc.), as well as punctuation issues (what was written as \"Peterson's\" should have actually been Petersons or Petersons' most of the time, as well as other inappropriate apostrophes and commas in other places). There are also problems with spelling consistency (The girl's name is spelled both \"Abby\" and \"Abbey\"; Jack's last name is first \"Burnside\" and then Burnsides). And probably one of the worst errors: a chapter name is spelled incorrectly! Some of these are very elementary errors that should have been found by any decent proofreader. I firmly believe that someone who is going to self-publish must have a better grasp on grammar and punctuation, or must put forth the effort to have their work reviewed by someone who does.Professional editors exist for a reason. I really think that if this book had been professionally edited, it would have been MUCH better. Unfortunately, if the author self-publishes the next book(s) in this saga, I will not be reading them.There were also plot and character issues. Lee is supposed to be highly trained but makes some really stupid decisions and seems to act based on emotion rather than training. Some of the things he says in his internal monologue make him seem rather mentally unprepared for his mission. His dog also did not act like a highly trained military dog. You don't have to give those dogs the same command multiple times or physically force them to do something (i.e. pull them off a target). Not to mention there is a massive plot flaw: why didn't the infecteds just use the ladder to get on the roof???I really can't believe this book has such a high rating.

The premise is the US government has prepared certain highly trained and well-supplied individuals to prep for a catastrophic event that could bring down the government. Our main protagonist, US Army Captain Lee Harden, is just such a person and he, naturally, never expects such an event to ever happen - but, of course, things do develop and the entire country is overtaken by murderous creatures who have been infected by a mysterious bacterium. This is classic zombie fiction - which enjoys huge popularity these days and DJ Molles knows exactly how to develop characters, tell a deliciously page-turning story and keep us hopping from crisis to crisis wondering how our survivors can possibly escape what seems like certain doom.

Did the AUTHOR bother to read this over, start to finish?IN FACT, the inconsistencies are so bad that there is one in the first sentence of the GoodReads description-- stating that the bunker is 40ft under his house, when the book only says 20ft.Not at all convinced I want to bother with the rest of the series.*Spoilers below*The worst inconsistency for me was the very clear warning in the mission run down at the beginning that, even before showing any symptoms, \"the infected are highly contagious\" and the multiple pleas for extreme precautions around anyone even possibly infected. Later in the book the Lee apparently had completely forgotten about this, because \"he knew he could not catch the plague simply from sitting next to Jack.\" I'm sorry, what? In addition to that, Lee had a major revelation that his neighbor had been bitten and then turned within hours (and was thankful to him for this important information) and yet after Jack is bitten Lee invites him to spend the night in the cab of a truck with he and three helpless civilians-- forget the fact that he would be highly contagious, but he's trusting that Jack won't \"turn\" and rip them all to shreds in their sleep?

This book has a few ways, one of which being that I guess it isn't technically a zombie book. The furys are dead people driven by a highly contagious bacteria to kill in as violent and raging a way as possible. Not all are like that, but they are all beyond saving. I liked that little twist, and was often afraid of what they would do. Molles has a solid skill set for creating tension and the narrator does a great job of creating the intended fast-paced tone. This is kind of like the movie version of I am Legend, both in the main character's initial isolation and in the kind of monsters. Kind of.The story starts out with Lee, a Captain in the US Army, getting the call to head to the bunker built below his house and to await further instructions. His mission's activation means the government has collapsed. Once he is ordered to go to the surface, his mission will be to save what is left of humanity. That may not be the most unique, but I can't think of another zombie story that starts out this way, and it did a great job of evoking the fantasy of what it would feel like to be in his position.Some have compared this to Day by Day Armageddon by J.L. Bourne, one of my favorite zombie novels. One difference is that DbDA is written in journal form. Another, is that DbDA hooked me more than The Remaining. Looking at the elements of each story, they are pretty similar in terms of both having a bunker to wait out the initial hopelessness of the outbreak (though DbDA did have him gathering supplies more and witnessing society crumbling, whereas The Remaining mostly fast forwards through that to him waiting in a bunker, working out and playing video games and wondering what's going on). It could also be that DbDA was one of the first zombie books I read. The Remaining is more serviceable than remarkable. Molles can write a good story, but there isn't a whole lot of new ground broken in this first book. Regardless, I enjoyed it and look forward to the next book. I care about his cast of characters and the mixture of enemies between furies and rouge soldiers has created enough tension for me to want to see what he does next. As I said above, very good job by the narrator. His main gift was in enhancing the tension, something that audiobooks do best and this one is up there with the top of what I've listened to."}, {"userName": "Tanja Berg", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg", "userReview": "Rating: 2.5* out of 5. Captain Lee sits in a bunker with his dog Tango and suspects the world as he knew has ended. He has orders. After 30 days he is to emerge to try establish law and order, together with one more such coordinator per state. I would have the the United States of America could have afforded to bunker more than one soldier per state - how one person could restore a semblance of order when anarchy has established itself seems highly unrealistic. But I side-track. Anyway, when he emerges Lee tries to do precisely this. A large part of the population has succumbed to a bacteria which has selectively eaten away parts of the brain - removing that which makes us human, but leaving the bits which keeps us alive - breathing, eating, hunting, feeding. It quickly turns out that the worst challenges Lee will face are not the infected, but the rogues. I love the premise of this book, but the story is quite predictable as such.

A man is one of a few that are kept in bunkers when bad events take place in the US. This last time bad things really did happen. He's been expertly trained for years. So, when he does really stupid things, I'm saying to myself What the Fudge! I wouldn't have done that and I've had zero training. Here's some of his most stupid actions: 1) Rescues a boy then leaves the boy with his dog saying he'll be back in a couple of hours - not telling the boy it may be longer, that here's where my dog does his business. He just says stay put which of course the kid doesn't do; 2) Doesn't bolt his front door so one of the undead gets in - if this were my guy I'd slap him; 3) Goes to rescue some people stuck on a roof and parks his car in the road thinking it's out in the open and everybody can see it but oh well. He was warned that civilization would deteriorate quickly but he think he's exempt for some reason; 4) Goes to a farm and when the group that stole his truck (yes, the one he left out for everybody to see) shoots the poop out of the house, does he shoot them back? Yes, but he doesn't kill the most experienced (read ex-military) because it doesn't seem right; 5) So, these ex-military guys THAT HE DIDN'T SHOOT just happen to have his REGISTRATION from his truck so they know where to go for vengeance and burn down his wonderful, fully packed with guns, solar panels and food house. He's the historical romance version of the Too Stupid To Live (TSTL) female character that are so prevelant in those books.

Ehrlich. Auch f\u00fcr den Fall, dass die Zivilisation, so wie wir sie (aus dem Fernsehen) kennen, zusammenbricht. Sobald die US-Regierung, das Milit\u00e4r und die zivilen Beh\u00f6rden nicht mehr dazu in der Lage sind den Staat zu f\u00fchren, tritt eine ganz besondere Einheit in Aktion.Eigentlich ist es ja das gegenteil einer 'Einheit', denn dieser Haufen Soldaten (f\u00fcr jeden und in jedem US-Bundesstaat gibt es einen) ist \u00fcber das ganze Land verstreut. Wann immer Gefahr droht das Bundesgebiet zu \u00fcberrollen (etwa ernstzunehmende Kriegsdrohungen, Krankheiten, etc.), werden diese Soldaten in Bunker geschickt, wo sie eine ganze Weile auf ihren Einsatz warten. Meist handelt es sich bei ihren Bunker-Besuchen nur um kurzfristige Aufenthalte, und sie werden wieder an die frische Luft gelassen. Diesmal jedoch nicht.Die Bilder, die Lee, Captain der US-Armee, \u00fcber seinen Computer zu sehen bekommt sind furchtbar. Eine Seuche l\u00e4sst Menschen an der Oberfl\u00e4che ausrasten und bringt die Welt aus dem Gleichgewicht. Er und sein Hund Tango sind vielleicht (zusammen mit den von ihm weit entfernten anderen Spezial-Soldaten) die letzten Wesen auf diesem Planeten, die noch ein 'normales Leben' f\u00fchren. Wenn auch ohne Sonnenlicht.Schlie\u00dflich wird klar, dass die Situation sich nicht mehr bessert, und so kommt es dazu, dass Lee die Notfallpl\u00e4ne mitgeteilt bekommt, an die er sich zu halten hat. Er soll die Ordnung wiederherstellen und Recht & Gesetz in die Post-Apokalypse bringen.Als w\u00e4re diese Aufgabe, an der die gesamte US-Army, der Verwaltungsapparat, die Polizei und wer-nicht-sonst-noch scheiterten, nicht ein wenig ... gewagt gro\u00df f\u00fcr einen einzelnen Soldaten (auch, wenn er bis an die Z\u00e4hne bewaffnet ist), nimmt er seine Arbeit auf.Gleich sein erster Auftritt in dieser Endzeit macht klar: Er ist nicht ausreichend auf das Grauen vorbereitet, das ihn erwartet. Eine Infizierte, ein junges M\u00e4dchen, verletzt ihn schwer und zwingt ihn, seine Lage v\u00f6llig zu \u00fcberdenken. Schlie\u00dflich macht er sich erneut ans Werk und seine ersten Schritte in eine Welt, in der es \u00fcberall von miesen Kerlen, Vergewaltigern und brutalen Meuchelm\u00f6rdern wimmelt. Die Infizierten, deren k\u00f6rperliche und geistige F\u00e4higkeiten zwar stark herabgesetzt wurden, und deren fehlendes Schmerzempfinden sie zu unglaublich z\u00e4hen Gegnern macht, sind dabei nur ein Teil des Problems.Als er endlich den ersten \u00dcberlebenden retten kann, f\u00e4ngt sein Leben an wieder Sinn zu ergeben. Auch, wenn es nur ein kleiner Erfolg ist, schlie\u00dft Lee daraus, dass der Plan vielleicht irrwitzig ist, aber nicht v\u00f6llig sinnlos.'Unter Toten' ist Zombie-Kost der Hausmannssorte. Die Untoten sind gar nicht untot, sondern geistern als Kranke, als infizierte Menschen unglaublich aggressiven Typs (also als 'schnelle Zombies') durch die Welt.Wer hie und da auf Logik verzichten kann (zum Beispiel auf eine Antwort auf die Frage, warum in nur einem Monat \u00fcberall M\u00f6rderbanden aus dem Boden und auf alles schie\u00dfen, was sich so bewegt), der bekommt eine spannende Story mit einem leicht comichaften, \u00fcberzeichneten Helden serviert.Ein Wort vielleicht noch zum Stil: Auch, wenn ich nicht wei\u00df, ob der nicht schon im Original an manchen stellen furchtbar war - die \u00dcbersetzung scheint mir furchtbar. Das Wort 'Lippenfurz' hat in einem Endzeit-Roman nichts zu suchen und zerst\u00f6rt die Emotionalit\u00e4t jeder Szene, in der es verwendet wird. Es ist nat\u00fcrlich nicht der einzige 'Fehler' dabei, aber er steht stellvertretend f\u00fcr all meine Kritik an der Sprache des Romans.\u00dcbrigens: Am Ende gibt es noch eine Bonus-Story. Diese ist wesentlich packender als die Geschichte im Roman selbst. Vielleicht, weil es keinen v\u00f6llig \u00fcberzeichneten Helden gibt. Es lohnt sich jedenfalls sie zu lesen!"}, {"userName": "Peter Smith", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24845663-peter-smith", "userReview": "In years to come, literature students will probably not be gathering to discuss the symbology and hidden meaning of The Remaining. And I'm fine with that.Instead what we have here is a fast-moving survival horror story. The premise is that the main character is part of a program where, any time a crisis is impending, soldiers are sent to underground bunkers so that if civilization comes unraveled, they can emerge and try to help organize survivors. 1 soldier per state, well armed and supplied and ready to bring people together. Just go with it... :)In this case the crisis is a highly contagious disease that ravages the mind, leaving a feral shell with an insatiable hunger behind. Basically zombies with a quasi-medical explanation. But not shuffling, slow zombies. These are fast moving zombies that often carry basic weapons like hammers, shovels or anything they might swing. And y'know, that's all you need to know. The book starts with Lee Harden leaving his bunker with his trusty canine pal Tango to fight the infected and try to restore the world. And of COURSE what he needs to worry about most is the other survivors out there. Do know that the books tends towards lots of discussion of guns and military gear that borders on infatuation, and in a lot of ways it's not a particularly original story.But it's entertaining and a fun read and I'm looking forward to the next book in the series."}, {"userName": "Derek", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9140603-derek", "userReview": "I'm a big fan of the post apocalyptic genre. I'm also a big fan of zombies. Not all zombie books are post apocalyptic, but this series seems to be what I would consider the best of both worlds.I really like the characters, and the pace of the books is excellent. Truly masterfully told. Dialogue is something that I tend to notice as being weak, or unnecessary filler in a lot of books. Certainly not this series. It seems very well done.The plot kept me interested the whole time. Always wondering what the next chapter had in store. And I dare say, as far as zombies go, this series does it better than anything I've seen so far. Zombies don't live on endlessly, crawling around with half a body. They're people. They lose enough blood, they die. It's so much more realistic than most of what you see out there. I love how the zombies (never actually referred to as zombies, which I like) function. I love how terrifying they are compared to anything else I've read. They truly are the most horrifying zombies I've ever seen, and I love it.I consider The Remaining series among my top 3 favorite reads of all time, right up there with WOOL and Ready Player One. I hope this series never ends. I'm very impressed by D.J.

They are dark, depressing, disturbing, and generally don't end well. The world in them usually doesn't improve and only gets worse. This one was also really graphic at times and kind of made me ill with some descriptions of what bullets do to people. I can be trusted to know what they'll do without this. The satellites falling out of the sky issue stuck out for me when Lee mentioned the GPS being so important to him. They use satellites to pinpoint locations away from the person using them. It would be a glorified paperweight for him. A lot of Lee's decisions were questionable for me and made me wonder how he made captain. Also, why would the government put him in a bunker with no way to see the outside world, other than by email? If Lee has been in this bunker so many times, I think he would have requested something like this. He can't do his job real well if he goes outside and gets immediately killed by something the camera could have warned him about. I'm curious enough to continue with the series, but the gloom of this book doesn't give me a lot of hope for this world and the books.COYER - Read a book with a male protagonist - 2 points (Lee Harden, male protagonist)"}, {"userName": "Trish", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish", "userReview": "I really liked this more grim version of a post-apocalyptic world.

Now - spoilers! - about the stuff I did not like or understand: 1. Why did they abandon Lee's bunker?! The house was just burnt down! With the villains gone they could have dug through the debris to the bunkers entrance and at least cleared it out! 2. Tango's dead!

Bad guys that think it's okay to kill others for sport, or rule, or whatever their thoughts are. Lee is a bad ass, like I expect all our military is to some extent.

I don't understand the high rating. There were continuity issues. Lee is not believable as a military officer, nor is the premise itself believable.We meet Lee in his underground bunker waiting to hear from a government official. He doesn't, and 48hrs after not hearing he has to open a secret file that describes the situation that got him sent underground until further notice. It's a virus that has spread. If he's reading this then the government is gone/infected and he's supposed to emerge from his bunker in 30 days and restore order and help survivors. LEE IS STUPID: First of all. Lee is all scared and anxious about not hearing from his contact. Then after he reads the file, he thinks it can't be that bad. He doesn't obey the order to wait 30 days to exit his bunker and goes out to explore only to get stabbed in the leg right on his front door step by a crazed infected teen aged girl. Stupidity alert!!! The first of many. Why would a highly trained officer get so antsy and not obey orders and then bumble immediately into danger. INCONSISTENCY IN STORY: The next day he decides to check on his neighbors. Through a window he sees their teen age daughter laying on the couch. He takes of his mask to knock on the window to get her attention. Then the father appears, crazed and infected, and he has to shoot him several times and then he mentioned breathing harshly through his mask. HELLO! He took it off! Which was soooo stupid in the first place. He knows the virus is highly contagious. I didn't buy that this one dude was supposed to come out of his bunker and restore order to the chaos. I didn't buy that his underground bunker wouldn't include cameras to monitor the house and the perimeter. There are evidently other guys like him in bunkers because he emails a guy to ask \"is this real\" before he leaves the bunker, but there'e no other coordination or anything. If him or other guys like him were our last hope at restoring order, then I assume they are screwed. oh, yeh, his bunker and house got burned down too. Sigh. lol.

I read it because it is indeed a fast paced story, no dearth of action, and has the minimum of required plot twists I didn't see coming to keep me turning pages. This story has holes in both character development and story line, but that was okay with me because I didn't want a deep story line with a ton of development. With that caveat in mind, this book could have been top shelf sic-fi had those elements been dealt with. I'll be largely stereotypical here and say that this story would be the male equivalent of a Harlequin romance novel; in place of sex and pseudo romance, there are guns and blood. For whatever reason I was able to put aside the obvious flaws to enjoy a read that seems well worth the price point. It was maddening at times because of over-used words like 'infected' and 'go-to-hell pack.' You'll see what I mean, and I suspect appreciate that it is too much. I wanted to believe that the main character was indeed special forces, but I just couldn't; like Maxwell Smart used to say, he \"Missed it by that much.\" Again, it was okay once I accepted that because it felt pretty close to my vision of such a warrior, and from my very limited knowledge, if the position did indeed exist, special forces would be the group assigned the task.This book is a paradox for me, despite the holes myself and others have mentioned, it really was enjoyable to read. I'm into the sequel right now, and the story is unfolding with more characters and of course more bad guys plus infected. If taken for what it is, this book is a fine read, and great for burning a few hours during the summer."}, {"userName": "Kelly Jordan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10020770-kelly-jordan", "userReview": "As a NC resident and huge fan of post-apocalytpic zombie genre lit, I was absolutely floored to stumble on D.J. Molles' \"The Remaining\" on my Kindle. The first of (currently) four books in the series, the plot is completely engrossing and fast paced. The premise is interesting-- the US government has 50 military trained agents, one in every state, with a secret bunker installed beneath their home. Whenever the US is under any sort of threat, 9/11, avian flu, North Korea talking big with nukes, they get sent underground with daily updates until the coast is deemed clear for them to re-emerge. In the event that the worst happen, a threat come to pass that demolishes the government, chain of command, etc, those 50 men are given very specific instructions to carry out. The latest threat is a flu-like virus with bizarre symptoms and a terrifying fatality rate. Captain Lee Hardin, North Carolina's operative, is sent into his bunker. And then his daily updates stop coming in. It basically goes to hell from there, and gets very scary, very fast.From what I gather the author is self-published, props to him! But the downside to this, and the reason I gave him four instead of five stars is due to more than a few glaring grammatical and spelling mistakes any editor worth their salt would have caught, especially in the first two books of the series.

It felt like characters were spliced from other novels/films etc to make it more interesting but without real use or relevance to the story ie, Tango just feels as if he were there for the ahh factor and baby sitter. There were also a few plot holes which without would have scored a definite 4 with me:Why with such effort made for a state of the art bunker were there no surveillance camera's strategically placed to see incoming unfriendlies.I kept asking myself why did he not re-establish contact with his cooperatives in the other states to gather intelligence at the start of his active order before the unfortunate event. Did I miss something. Why did the undead not use, with their basic intelligence displayed at various other times, the ladder in a particular scene?Oh yes, there was the shift writing perspective into the 3rd person which irritated me as it pulled me out of the scene. Fortunately this was not a regular feature. All in all, I do feel mean as I really did enjoy this quick, fast paced read which kept me interested to the end, and up to the early hours reading.
