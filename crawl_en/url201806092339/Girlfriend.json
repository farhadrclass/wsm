No se si estoy teniendo muy mala pata para elegir, pero realmente \u00bfqu\u00e9 onda?Ni siquiera llegu\u00e9 a terminarlo y eso que hice un esfuerzo, pero \u00bfun libro en el cual llevo casi un cuarto y no ha pasado nada? Tuvo un par de frases graciosas pero hasta ah\u00ed. El problema no es lo machista del libro (lo cual sea paso, miercole) es la forma en que est\u00e1 presentado. Todo el tiempo el protagonista est\u00e1 diciendo \"s\u00e9 que es machista, pero qu\u00e9 se le va a hacer\" Las personas machistas no se dan cuenta de que lo son, y quiero pensar con toda mi esperanza en la humanidad, que si se dieran cuenta se horrorizar\u00edan de su manera de pensar y no simplemente decir y bueno. Ni siquiera empecemos a hablar de Gerard, qu\u00e9 ser humano m\u00e1s horrendo. El \u00fanico que me cay\u00f3 bien fue el perro y eso es porque es un perro.Adem\u00e1s de todo eso, sumamente tedioso de leer y lento, y se perd\u00eda demasiadas veces en cuestiones que no me dec\u00edan nada ni de la personalidad del protagonista, ni del argumento."}, {"userName": "Carrie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/602951-carrie", "userReview": "It's like chick-lit for men (but probably read more by women anyway). Two roommates are fighting for the affections of their friend's last girlfriend before he died. A few lines into the first page, the narrator establishes himself as hilariously honest: \"I do not want to be unkind so let me reassure you that your shortcomings are largely physical...You can't love someone if you think they've got a big nose, not properly. As a man, you might have kids with them, dogs, a cottage, etc. You might get caught in rain storms and drink wine in the sun, do all the romance bit, but when you look deep into her eyes it will be because you want to avoid looking at her nose.\" Read for a good laugh."}, {"userName": "Lauren", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6371997-lauren", "userReview": "I remember reading this years ago and being horrified at the suggestion all men actually think like the main character.

Originally published in the U.K., the edition I read was packed with Britishisms (not necessarily a bad thing). The humor at times seems excessive, detracting from the plot. One of the better books in the genre."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3269646-amanda", "userReview": "Harry is looking for the One. He's spent years looking for her and tried out 43 women in his quest to find her. When she walks into his life, he doesn't expect it - and then realises that his best mate Gerrard is also trying to win her heart. It seems that there really is nothing fair in love or war, as both men try to sabotage each other - and themselves - in their efforts to make Alice the One.I picked up this novel for a few reasons. The first is that Mark Barrowcliffe published his debut fantasy novel Wolfsangel under the name M D Lachlan last year - I loved that book, and was interested to see what he could do within a different genre. I'm also keen on men writing in the field of chick lit, since it seems to be an ideal way to see what men really are thinking! *grin* I was expecting a light, funny read that I could easily pick up and put down, and would be briefly amused by.Rather than this, I got a biting portrayal of real life men in slightly farcical circumstances. The banter is bitter, the humour is puerile in the most part, and the men are distinctly unlikeable. But it does come across as incredibly realistic, as Barrowcliffe covers the ways in which men will dump women and the criteria they have for picking women.The humour in the novel is uneven and scattershot, but I did find myself laughing out loud on more than one occasion. More often I was slightly mystified, but I suspect a guy would have been howling.I enjoyed the characters, which are larger than life and easy to poke fun at. I rather marvelled at the idea that people like this exist (although a brief conversation with Mark revealed that he based Gerrard and Farley on real characters, which is a massive worry of mine - because it means they are out there walking the street, and there is a faint chance I might meet them by accident!)What concerned me about this novel is how missold it seemed. It carries the sort of cover that shouts 'chick lit' and I was expecting something along the lines of Mike Gayle - cosy and sweet and trying to present the idea of men as being nice people who don't try to pull women just for the sex. Barrowcliffe is the vicious antidote to Gayle's saccharine sweetness, and it takes some effort to get through the initial shock and embrace the darker elements of the novel.As I've come to expect from Mark, it was well-written (especially considering this one was his true debut in the literary world, although not too surprising if you take into account his journalistic background), but probably overlong at nigh on 500 pages.I will seek out some more of Mark's earlier work, but I won't revisit this novel again! For a single 30-something girl, it hit a little too close to home *grins* If you want to read this, I would suggest that you make sure you're in a wonderful and warm, loving relationship and then tackle it - so that you don't end up scared at the prospect of encountering these men when you put yourself out there!"}, {"userName": "R.M.", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4150819-r-m", "userReview": "A raz\u00e3o principal pela qual n\u00e3o gostei deste livro acho que se deveu, em parte, \u00e0s minhas expectativas. Esperava um livro c\u00f3mico, com pouca profundidade, que me fizesse rir por um bocado. Mas n\u00e3o, n\u00e3o cumpre a fun\u00e7\u00e3o. \u00c0 primeira vista, H\u00e1 uma tarefa simples para este livro realizar e este n\u00e3o a realiza. Come\u00e7amos por nos deparar com t\u00edpicos machistas e p\u00e1ginas (demasiadas) a descrever esta e mais outra situa\u00e7\u00e3o. As personagens parecem bem delineadas ao in\u00edcio mas ao longo da narrativa, tornam-se completamente diferentes! O autor perde-se entre o rude, o c\u00f3mico e o profundo (mesmo quando n\u00e3o h\u00e1 necessidade para o ser... novamente volto \u00e0s minhas expectativas). De um momento para o outro, duas personagens que achava t\u00e3o distintas, come\u00e7am-me a parecer iguais. N\u00e3o consegui acabar o livro, n\u00e3o digo que n\u00e3o tenha tido curiosidade em saber o final mas simplesmente tornou-se desesperante querer um desenrolar da hist\u00f3ria e sermos impedidos pelos constantes \"\u00c0 partes\" ou pormenores n\u00e3o relevantes em primeira pessoa."}, {"userName": "M", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5065197-m", "userReview": "i liked that it was different as one said 'chic-lit for men'. i appreciate the tone, humor and the point of view. some parts may drag on and lose you and you'd probably be scratching your head wondering if the over analyzing was actually coming from a male voice. the very first thing that bugged me was having 'death' as a trend (not a main focus) in his novels-that's 2/2 that i've read of his. the style of writing is something i haven't gotten used to and I would admit that it took me a while to get into the flow, the same feeling i had with Lucky Dog, originally i had wanted to read Girfriend 44 first, Luck Dog was just lucky to have been purchased first. Overall, reading till the last word was good enough satiating. as for the Hornby comments i think i prefer watching him instead of reading, How To Be Good was traumatizing and About A Boy after watching it several times has come to be an annoying little bugger."}, {"userName": "-A", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7001662--a", "userReview": "When I started reading this book, it felt fresh and witty because I've never really read a similar book (a chick-flick written by a man) with many British references and jokes. I found it hilarious and funny and Harry as the main character felt endearing despite being actually unlikable (he had this quality about him) but a couple chapters in it just got old and boring. The author seemed to be hung up on jokes, instead of really moving the story along and telling the story in general.

The author could have condensed it down to about half it's size w/o losing any of the storyline.
