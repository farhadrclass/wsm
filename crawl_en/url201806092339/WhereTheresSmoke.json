I'm not a huge fan of how Picoult switches POVs every chapter in her novels so I liked how this (short) story stuck to just one POV. I think I would be more inclined to read more of her if she just stuck to one (or two) POVs for a considerable amount of pages. Also, not sure if this is just me since I haven't read many short stories but the ending was very abrupt. Like really, really abrupt. I didn't even realize the story was over until I kept scrolling and there was nothing more...2.5 stars just because of it's ending and I wasn't too crazy about the main character, Serenity - she was very cocky and annoying - but the story was building up nicely, got me hooked, and left me curious and wanting more."}, {"userName": "Sharon", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11267295-sharon", "userReview": "From as young as four years old, Serenity Jones could see people that no one else could see. Of course Serenity's mother never believed her the day she told her that she could see a little boy in their house. Her mother told Serenity that the boy wasn't real, but to Serenity he was. Having lived with her gift most of her life, Serenity now has her own very successful television show where she has the ability and the gift to communicate with the dead. It is here that she is able to help people get messages to their loved ones that are no longer here. Serenity is approached by a war widow, Betsey Rycroft who's husband died in Iraq and she want's to get in touch with him. At first things start out as they normally do, where Serenity has her two spirit guides, Lucinda and Desmond by her side, but it's what happens next that is unexpected.

Serenity Jones is a genuine psychic with her own TV show. She\u2019s been psychic all her life, something her mother recognised from her own great-grandma, an Iroquois healer. Serenity has two spirit guides: Lucinda, a re\ufb01ned, elderly African- American woman; and Desmond, a \ufb01erce, feisty gay man. When a war widow whose husband died in Iraq comes on the show wanting to contact him, his message for his wife is not what she was hoping for. And when the reaction this elicits is not to his satisfaction, Serenity becomes the subject of his ire. Serenity Jones is a fascinating and rather fiery woman who is a pivotal character in Picoult\u2019s twenty-first novel, Leaving Time, and Picoult offered this short story as a free gift to fans eagerly awaiting her latest novel. The short story also includes an excerpt from Leaving Time.

I found the premise interesting and saw it was just .99 on the Google Play Store, which is free money for me since I participate in the Google Rewards surveys. I always get books with the money I earn from the surveys.Serenity also has two spirit guides who are entertaining to say the least. And temperamental too! Serenity has a war widow on her show who is hoping to speak to her husband. Things go wrong and Serenity doesn\u2019t know what to do. Then she sees a politician on television whose child has gone missing, and she decides what to do next.Serenity is also a character in the novel Leaving Time. I would be interested in reading that novel now, which is the point to a short story. Jodi did what she was intending in this case by writing this short story. This is the first I have read by Jodi Picoult although I have several of her novels. I own Mercy, My Sisters\u2019 Keeper, Plain Truth, and will very soon own Small Great Things.

I sometimes really want more from them and other times I'm completely satisfied that it was short because maybe I didn't like who it was about or just something was off to me the entire time. Yeah, no, that didn't happen this time guys. NOPE, I loved everything about this one.Serenity Jones could see dead people. Yeah, I just went sixth sense on you guys. Now again, I don't really believe in this kind of stuff - but I have to give the girl mad props. Especially since no one believe her when she was younger and they all probably talked shit about her behind her back saying she was crazy af or that she talks to invisible people all the time. Well, those people are wrong and I loved everything about Serenity.Where There's Smoke was such a good story. Short but amazing. It will definitely leave you wanting more.

Although I didn't find her a very likable character (which I think was intended), I thought the fact that she was a psychic with her own cable show was an interesting angle for a story.

I recall getting a Picoult novel a few years ago from a friend and returning it back to her un-read after three weeks. This short story did not make me want to run out and get more of her books. This book was pretty weird I would say. I think because it was a short story we are not given anytime as readers to absorb what we are reading about. Everything was very rushed and put together and with the rather abrupt ending which doesn't let you know how things play out one way or the other, this book didn't do it for me at all.This short story focuses on psychic Serenity Jones. We find out that Serenity (unlike most psychics) is a household name and is a more popular t.v. host than this book's version of Oprah is. She has used her powers to find missing children and can talk to loved one's deceased friends and families. I don't know what to say about Serenity. If I had a gift that could find missing children and capture killer's, I don't know if I would be sitting around obsessing about the ratings of my tv show and how much money I had (like she does) all of the time. She was not that very interesting of a character.Jodi Picoult mashes some truly odd things about this character and the overall plot (a reading gone wrong) gets kind of lost in this story as Serenity's character does what is necessary in order to get back on top. The author gives her pink hair (for some reason, I still don't get that one) and we have her throw up an aside that she gets her hair done at a black hair salon and is proud to be the only white woman there (super odd). There's just little things thrown in here and there you kind of go huh about. Another example, Serenity's mother apparently has a great grandmother who was an Iroquois healer that was also psychic. I recall reading that line like four times going huh?The dialogue really isn't that great. There is a lot of explanation about her powers and the other side and heaven and God and man oh man I just rolled my eyes. Especially when Serenity does this whole some things you just need to experience for yourself. The flow is really weird too. We have a bad reading that all of a sudden means danger to Serenity's show. So she goes off and does something else even when she knows she has no support so to speak. I think I was supposed to be shocked by the outcome, but once again I scratched my head wondering what she was going for here. I think there was supposed to be an overall point about misusing your gifts, I don't know. I thought this entire story was extremely ham-fisted and hard to believe. The ending just happens. I thought maybe I missed a page or something, but nope. It just kind of ends. This short story is a set-up to showcase this character's appearance in Picoult's full length novel, \"Leaving Time\". I am not going to go seek that book out. Nothing about Serenity has me interested enough to read about her further."}, {"userName": "Claire (Book Blog Bird)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10982678-claire-book-blog-bird", "userReview": "This popped up on Amazon one day as a free ebook so I decided to give it a shot.

The paranormal aspect isn\u2019t really a genre I normally pick up, but I couldn\u2019t put this down. Serenity Jones was an interesting character and I found learning about her special gift to be as well. I won\u2019t say that I am a believer of mediums, but the way Picoult described the process of connecting with the spirits seem to be well.. believable. Although the ending was quite abrupt, I was pleased to learn that Serenity is featured in the full length novel Leaving Time by the same author. I am looking forward to reading not only that story but several other of Picoult\u2019s works as well.

Never having previously read any of Jodi Picoult's work formed doubts in my mind as to whether I would enjoy the writing. But the ebook was free so I got it on a whim and I was not disappointed.As far as I'm aware, this short story is a prequel to another of Picoult's books Leaving Time and Picoult has also written another prequel that goes by the name of Larger than Life. I've only read this one and I understand that these prequels are written to introduce the characters to the readers. The writing in this book was pleasantly surprising. Any doubts I had quickly disappeared as the writing flowed and complimented the story very much. In this prequel, we meet Serenity Jones- a psychic who prides herself in her fame and fortune she gained from hosting a talk show where she invites the public to call upon their loved ones who have passed. Serenity definitely fit the bill of having pride- almost arrogance yet she wasn't unlikable. Readers root for Serenity and enjoy reading about her strange life. She, despite her vanity isn't spiteful, she's just an ordinary (depending on your definition of ordinary) woman in want for more fortune, like any other rich person.I found the supernatural elements of the book particularly interesting. This book wasn't a horror story nor was it trying to be. Readers are introduced to how Serenity first realised she had the gift of talking to the dead. But aside from that, Serenity's Gift is portrayed quite casually to the readers just as Serenity has known of the unearthly her whole life; making it very normal to her and this comes through in the writing too as readers are also expected to think of the paranormal concept as normal.Overall, I enjoyed it very much, surprisingly so. I look forward to picking up Leaving Time of which this story is merely a prequel."}, {"userName": "Judy Collins", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11063006-judy-collins", "userReview": "For all you Jodi Picoult fans, you cannot miss WHERE THERE'S SMOKE, an e-book short story novella, setting the stage for her heartwarming and upcoming LEAVING TIME, Oct 14, 2014.Serenity Jones is one of the three narrators featured in LEAVING TIME.
