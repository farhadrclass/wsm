I love Melanie, and the characters, and the whole idea of Mel's business. But then it started getting all language-y, and a little too rated R in the bedroom, and then the ending was like, what was that? Was that an ending? That was a crappy ending. So what I am saying in this intensely badly written review is, I wish this book had been cleaner, and ended more solidly. If for those things, it would have been a 5 star review. Alas, 2 stars it is."}, {"userName": "Jennie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/869743-jennie", "userReview": "I really wanted to like this book more than I actually did. I felt like a lot of the dialogue was forced and more proper than people actually speak and i found that rather jarring. While I liked the overall idea of the plotline, it fell rather flat. Some of the characters felt a little forced and all of Kai's nicknames for Mel? Just didn't fit at all with either of their personalities, at least to me."}, {"userName": "Angela", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2896174-angela", "userReview": "For me, the first half of this book was much better than the second half.

There are some books that make me REALLY excited to read them, and others that leave me lukewarm. And it's absolutely impossible to tell how a book will turn out other than simply reading it. That being said, what drew me to this book was the fact that the main character had lost a lot of weight, just like myself. Melanie was married to a thin guy, Andrew. She was fat. Then she lost weight, and found out that Andrew was having an affair with a heavy girl. So she decides to open a healthy food store. Yet....this book was chick lit sadly. I hoped for a deeper plot, instead I got a very slow developing one, with little or no shocking disclosures or incidents. It left me hungry for more. I liked the receipes at the end of this book, but I wouldn't recommend this book to most people, sadly."}, {"userName": "Cynthia (Bingeing On Books)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5819300-cynthia-bingeing-on-books", "userReview": "I had so many hopes for this book. Melanie is a former fat girl who lost her husband to another woman (a fat one) after she lost a bunch of weight. Then she decides to open a healthy eating store. I think part of what saved this book was the food . . . all the glorious food!! Every single chapter had a food name or a dish as the title and it talked about a childhood memory that Melanie had regarding that food. And oh man, the descriptions of the food throughout the book were glorious. It made me so hungry and it made me wish that Melanie was a real person so she could be my personal chef and cook healthy for me all the time. There were even recipes at the end of the book! The recipes were for every dish that had a chapter title and there were both healthy and decadent versions of the recipes. Mmm . . . yummy!So back to the story . . . I enjoyed it at first. I thought Melanie was a really relatable character. I am still overweight and I have just as many issues with food as Melanie does. Like me, Melanie is addicted to food and is struggling to find a balance between satisfying her cravings and treating her body right. I know from personal experience that this is so hard. I absolutely loved her nutritionist and kind of wish she had been featured more. Melanie only had phone consultations with her, but she was super supportive and completely nonjudgmental. I loved the nutritionist's opinion of food: there is no bad food and everything is fine in moderation! And can I please get a nutritionist who will give me a homework assignment to eat cupcakes please? I also loved the friendships with Delia and Kai and Phil and the addition of Nadia was awesome. I think where it started to fall apart for me was with the introduction of Nathan. The plot started to drag out way too much during the romance and it seemed like all the \"problems\" they had were manufactured ones by the author for the sake of creating more drama. Melanie started to seem really angry and she overreacted at some stuff and she just didn't seem to care about other people's feelings. Nathan was a bit boring. I liked him at first, but then he started getting in Melanie's business. Nadia lived with Melanie and Nathan was all panicked because they didn't know much about Nadia'a past. And then he started putting that big in Melanie's ear. I guess she thought that since Nadia lived with her, she was supposed to share everything about her past. Umm, no. They didn't even know each other well enough to do that. And the ending of the book was just blah. I still don't know if there was any character development or what the point of the story was. I thought the point was for Melanie to try and rebuild her life after her husband left her. It started out that way, but then it just disintegrated into a predictable chick lit story, I wish this story had gone deeper and the only reason I gave this book three stars instead of two was because of all the food."}, {"userName": "Teresa", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3180-teresa", "userReview": "What its about: A woman who realizes that her body isn't going to be able to sustain her unhealthy ways. She loses half of her body weight and quits her high stress job as a lawyer. She goes to culinary school and opens up a gourmet take out cafe that specializes in healthy food. She's finally getting her life together when she receives a huge shock. Her husband leaves her for a woman bigger than she ever was. Introduce a financial crisis, a new roommate and a potential boyfriend, stir vigorously and see what happens. Why I read it: How many times have we all thought of the \"if only's\" in our lives? When I read the synopsis I thought of all of the times I'd thought that things would be better if... and knew that I had to read this book. My thoughts: I must be on a food kick the last few weeks. First reading Georgia's Kitchen and all of its fantastic sounding food then immediately picking up Good Enough to Eat. Each chapter is starts with some sort of dish that is woven into the story either through a memory or something that is happening currently. The best part, Ballis provides the recipes at the end of the book! I love the fact that their are healthy versions along side the not so healthy ones. The only reason I haven't made any of them yet is that it's still too darn hot to cook!I left the story feeling inspired to do more of the things in life that bring me joy. Mel does just that. She quits her high paying job as a lawyer to embrace her love of food in a healthy manner and to help others in their quest to becoming healthy. She doesn't make as much money, but she is so much happier in her own body and in her life. There is a complete cast of quirky characters in this story that add depth to the story. Ballis introduces enough detail so that you know them as individuals, but not so much that you lose sight of what the story is about. Like a decadent dessert Good Enough to Eat will satisfy your craving for a great story."}, {"userName": "Patti", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1417211-patti", "userReview": "Below is from my review on my blog: http://pattispenandpicks.blogspot.com...I received Good Enough to Eat by Stacey Ballis at a very appropriate time in my life. The main character Melanie Hoffman has just gotten divorced, and so have I--different circumstances, but both Melanie and I have gone through big and interesting changes as a result.Melanie has achieved what so many women work at and obsess over--she lost over 100 pounds and has gotten herself to a healthy weight. She has also changed jobs, from being a lawyer to owning a small gourmet take-out cafe called Dining by Design. The food she offers is healthy, calorie conscious and good. The good marriage Melanie thought she had is not, and she is blind-sided by the fact that her husband leaves her for an overweight woman.Good Enough to Eat starts each chapter with descriptions of comfort foods, or remembered foods from Melanie's childhood, and then moves on to what is triggering the want of comfort. Melanie learns so much in this book, with the occasional two steps back that happens to everyone going through a life change like a divorce. She strengthens her current friendships, opens her own door and cafe to a young woman in her own transition, and develops new relationships, including a new man in her life.I thought this book was on track as far as someone going through a divorce, and also learning to accept herself and her imperfections as she grows into her new life. I liked the ending too.Highly recommended, and I'm glad that Melissa Broder (Penguin Group) and serendipty sent this book to me at this time. For those who want to know, yes, recipes are included."}, {"userName": "Myckyee", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/889581-myckyee", "userReview": "Melanie Hoffman, the heroine of Good Enough to Eat by Stacey Ballis, tackles what could be some very depressing challenges in her life: divorce, food issues, entrepreneurship (she owns a gourmet take-out caf\u00e9) and relationships. She manages (and sometimes mismanages) it all with pluck and support from family and friends.Each chapter in this novel begins with Melanie's reminisces about how certain foods relate to events in her life, be they large or small. Quite a variety of food is covered - mashed potatoes, chocolate cupcakes, peanut butter; I liked how the author was able to place them just so - they all have a place in the story. Also, all the food mentioned as the story chapters are included twice in recipes at the back of the book. The first recipe for cupcakes is a health conscious variation of the second which are called Decadent Dark Chocolate Cupcakes, and from reading through the ingredients they are, well, more decadent than the lighter version. I haven't tried any of the recipes yet but I definitely plan to.The author describes some of Melanie's preparations in getting the caf\u00e9's food ready for customers and the interaction between employees makes it sound like fun - I'd like to work there! I imagine though, that no matter how much fun it is, and how much help Melanie has from her employees, running a caf\u00e9 is a lot of work. I didn't (mostly) get that impression from reading this book. I mention this because I used to own an ice cream shoppe and though we only sold ice cream (in all its forms) it was time-consuming and intensive."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66739-sarah", "userReview": "I couldn't decide if this was a story or a weight loss blog. Additionally, while I love food, the constant lists of food at parties and the store that day got tiresome. It reeked of, \"Look at how much I know about food!\"As a story, it was okay. Kai was cool, but his neverending nicknames for everyone got annoying. The story itself was typical chick lit - woman gets left, finds herself with the help of friends, falls in love again, the end.As a weight loss story, it could have worked. The author did a great job capturing how it feels to be heavy, the struggles with binging, and how self-conscious heavy people are when eating around others. She also touched on how, even though the weight was gone, the main character still felt heavy, how that never, ever goes away. I almost wish she would have abandoned the main plot, because it's obvious the author lost a lot of weight, and that, itself, would have made for an interesting story. Interspersing it with the main plot and all of the food stories, though, left the book feeling scattered and disorganized. I couldn't wait for it to end.I also didn't like how the main character assumed every heavy girl was crying for help and too shy to ask. Come on... just because you lost a lot of weight, don't make it your personal crusade.The recipes at the end were nice. I might try a few of them. I also liked how she reminisced about food at the beginning of every chapter."}, {"userName": "Tara", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/819580-tara", "userReview": "I really wanted to like this book. I love Jen Lancaster, so I figured that her BFF is my BFF, right? I also love books about food, so this seemed right up my alley, but I really struggled to get through it.The story centers around Melanie, a former fat girl who left the law business to open a healthy take out restaurant. If that wasn't enough reinvention, her husband (clearly a chubby chaser) leaves her for her fat boss. Melanie is now forced to navigate a new world with her co-workers, roommate, and new boyfriend by her side.The character development here is pretty good. You really get to know the people and they are mostly believable. The thing that I found utterly ridiculous was the dialogue! I don't know a single person who is as wordy as all of these characters! They talk the way I might write an email to a colleague, not like how I would speak with a friend. It was just so hokey!Also, there's a lot of sex in this book. I get it. Fat people have sex too. Great. But do we need to discuss ravaging each other every time Nate and Mel get together? I think no. Once or twice is enough for me. I'll just assume for the rest of the relationship, thanks!It's really too bad. I think this book has a good message and could have been delightful.

I have a love/no love relationship with this book (hate is too strong a word). In the first two chapters, I was ready to put it down but since I was at the pool with nothing else to read...I carried on. I could TOTALLY identify with Melanie's love and adoration of food and her struggle to feel \"normal\" after losing over 100lbs. I did enjoy her dialogue with her food counselor about how we obsess over 5 pounds and what we are really saying/doing when we binge/cry/eat. I loved the titles and descriptions of food at the beginning of each chapter...especially the bacon, cause I love bacon. However, I don't think I've ever read a book that came to such an abrupt halt then called it an ending??! Throw me a bone, author...one more chapter, one year later, maybe? Or a nicely packaged epilogue. Yes, I know books are sometimes not meant to be wrapped up nicely...but this one NEEDED it.

She has flaws & insecurities, as well as, successes & pride. Ballis provides the crucial amount of insight into Melanie so that I can understand and relate to her, without becoming irritated that the plot is being overrun by the protagonist's inner thoughts. The \"supporting cast\" are colorful, soulful, real.Real is simply the best adjective I have for all of it. The romance is real, the life issues are real... It isn't a storybook fairytale, it's a glimpse into a fictional character's life.It's chick-lit, or \"women's fiction\" without the trite sap. Also, I really want to eat at Melanie's restaurant.

With the exception of her fixation on Andrew, nothing seemed to really impact her for very long. She got her magic prescription from her nutritionist, followed it to the letter, and all was right with the world again. All of the characters spoke in monologues.

Then her husband left her-for a woman twice her size. Immediately afterwards, she's blindsided by a financial crisis. Melanie reaches out to a quirky roommate with a ton of baggage and becomes involved in a budding romance with a local documentary filmmaker.In this warm and often laugh-out-loud novel, Melanie discovers that she still has a lot to learn about her friends, her relationships with men, and herself-and that her weight loss was just the beginning of an amazing journey that will transform her life from the inside out..This was your basic chick-lit book. There was nothing outstanding about it and the writing was mediocre. I picked this book up because it looked like a cute fun read and I had not read this author before. I liked the idea of the author trying to create a strong woman who has achieved her weight loss goals and opening her own food business to provide food for others that is healthy and tasty. Many woman know what its like to diet and eating bland gross food and because the food is so awful they fall off the wagon and go back to eating unhealthy. I liked how each chapter began with the name of a food and a brief description of Melanie's relationship with that food from the past and then that food shows up in the end of the chapter. I also liked the recipes at the end of the book. The author provided both healthy and classic recipes to appeal to all readers. These were all positives of the book. However, I had to rate this book 2 stars for so many reasons.I don't want to get into spoilerland but I feel like I have to justify my 2 star rating. I had a major problem with the characters! Let's start with the main character, Melanie. We are introduced to her on the first page and the reader immediately learns that she has lost half her body weight and has opened her own business selling healthy food that also tastes good. The reader also learns that her husband, Andrew, has just announced that he wants a divorce out of nowhere. He has been having an affair with, in Melanie's words, a fat girl from his office. Melanie thinks that Andrew only loved her for her fat and when she lost weight he lost his love for her. In my opinion, this was a strange introduction to a book. You would think that a woman with weight loss issues wouldn't be so harsh as to call another big woman \"fat\". Basically I thought Melanie was mean. While I was reading there were so many times that I thought \"Wow...she is really rude!\" At first she is really mean, in a passive aggressive way, to her new roommate Nadia. Her behavior is excused because she has trust issues and has always been independent and having a new roommate is annoying. I wanted to yell at her and say \"But you invited her to live with you so don't complain lady!!\". Melanie's invasion into Nadia's privacy and past was beyond forgivable. Nadia had every right to be upset but when Melanie calls her sister, who conveniently shows up in the story to excuse her behavior, her response was for Melanie to forgive herself and it was Nadia's problem if she was going to be mad at Melanie after being such a good friend. WHATEVER!! If I were Nadia I don't think I could have forgiven her. Melanie was also jealous of her friend and co-worker, Delia, when she received a windfall. Now Delia is a character who has been living in a women's shelter for a year after leaving an abusive husband. Who in their right mind would be jealous of Delia, who has had such a difficult life, when something good happens to them. Especially when she is supposed to be Melanie's friend. She also treats her new love interest very rudely in many places in the book. I don't have enough space to talk about all of Melanie's bad behavior! I also didn't like that the author found a way to justify her behavior using her sister and her weight loss coach Carey. Melanie drove me nuts.Then there was Kai, her gay co-worker. He was pretty cool but his constant little cutesy nicknames for Melanie, like Little Bittle, and Bitsy, just was annoying and over the top. I also feel like Kai and his partner were portrayed as just stereotypical gay men and they both could have added so much to the story if they hadn't been written as so silly. I did like Delia and Nadia. Their roles were minor but they were good hearted. I just wish they weren't Melanie's target for her issues. I have a mixed feelings about Melanie's boyfriend Nate. Sometimes he was a total selfish jerk and other times he was a perfect boyfriend.The characters were all over the place and I didn't feel like Ballis had a solid idea of what she really wanted to do with them as the story progressed.The ending was also so bad. It literally just ended. I had no idea I was at the end of the book and then I turned the page and it was the last one. It was so confusing. I know that not all books are wrapped up nice and neat and the author usually has a reason for an open ending and the reader can even figure out why there is an open ending. But I think the author just wanted to end the book so she did. I can't really explain it without giving too much away but lets just say the ending was really abrupt!So needless to say, I won't be recommending this book to others. The author had a really good idea for a book but she really lost her way. The concept was good but Ballis didn't carry it out. The book just seemed amateurish. There are much better chick lit books out there and my recommendation would to read a different one. 2 stars."}, {"userName": "Kimberly", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2771351-kimberly", "userReview": "This book started off great.
