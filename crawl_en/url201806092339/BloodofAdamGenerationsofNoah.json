What I loved about this book was the details of the pre-flood world. I don't remember reading a book set in this time period and it fascinates me.How civilized was Noah's generation? How did they live? What were cities like before the flood? What would a marriage celebration be like? Was creation a distant memory? Noah and his family are ridiculed and scorned and his daughters-in-law deal with it in different ways. Methuselah still lives in this book, at going on one thousand-years-old. Renita, the servant, is a good woman, though scarred. Denah's little sister is an innocent. Noah and Carmi grew up like brothers. But every thought of man is only evil continually, the water is coming, and the Bible says only six souls were saved. My favorite part involved the animals and how they came. Of course, this is just one author's imaginings, but I thought she did a great job and made it an appealing setting."}, {"userName": "Cindy ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35054702-cindy", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book and wish I could read the rest of the series."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5341164-amy", "userReview": "An interesting take on the family of Noah and the world that surrounded them before the flooded, as well as an intruiging idea as to why the birth order of Shem of Japtheth changes. 3.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Eve Culley", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46309286-eve-culley", "userReview": "I found this book to be very interesting and can safely include ending of this story as it is one that almost everyone has heard before. However, the twist is that this is a fictionalized account of the lives of Noah and his family following the Bible story. The story begins before the flood with the procuring of materials for the building of the ark, the arrival of the animals God sent and ends with the family in the ark waiting for the waters to recede. At the end of the book is a thought-provoking Q&A on Noah, the animals and possible explanations of the events.Blood of Adam includes the customs of the day, spice and perfume markets, selling of farmers produce, and the temple practices with the other gods worshipped by the people of Noah\u2019s town. Also included is why Noah was compelled to preach, the huge undertaking and completion of building the ark, and of the probable attitude of the people toward Noah\u2019s family along with the jeering and verbal insults of barrenness hurled at the women of Noah\u2019 family by the townsfolk.The people in the book are presented as humans who are following God\u2019s plan with all the pitfalls that includes. Overall Ms. Neal has, in my humble opinion, done justice to Noah and his family. I would encourage you to read this book."}, {"userName": "Barbara Keigher", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62049462-barbara-keigher", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book. I liked that it dealt with sin and forgiveness.I also found the ideas on what life may have been like back then fascinating.Of course, the sin nature of mankind has not changed, but the depiction of how evil it grew was well done.A lot of lies, misunderstanding, betrayal, etc. but how with the true God, in the end to those few who believed, it all worked out for good.I wish I could afford to read the next in the series. I certainly recommend this book.Well written, kept my interest throughout.I very much appreciated that it was a true Christian fiction novel. I have read some that claimed to be and there was almost no mention of God, no scripture etc. This novel however, had both and a great story as well.I love this author.I really like the way she depicted the animals coming to the ark in the end."}, {"userName": "Carol Mcgrath", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34767730-carol-mcgrath", "userReview": "A wonderful storyThis is a well written story about Noah and his children. Jepheth, his first born turned from God when he questioned his existence, so Noah made Shem his successor. There was a third son, Ham. Denah was given by her father as the bride of Jepheth, but she did not know if he would accept her. After there marriage she was not accepted by the women of the family and, because of this, her life, which was very different from how she grew up, was very hard for her. She wanted a child but none of the wives of Noah's children became pregnant. She decided to go to the temple of her people and became pregnant thereafter, but whose baby was it? She was banished from the home of Noah but did she make it back before the great flood?

Denah and the rest of Noah's family became so real. The author spent a great deal of time researching and introduces so many of her own ideas of how Noah and his family lived in the decades as they prepared the Ark to save the critters and son's of Adam's family. It's not a preachy book at all. It's a lovely love story filled with mystery! I highly recommend reading this novel! I'm so glad I stumbled upon it in my TBR pile.

I am not sure if the fact it incorporates a biblical storyline is good or bad.

Roy King", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32909440-a-roy-king", "userReview": "In \"Blood of Adam: Generations of Noah,\" Rachel S. Neal has created a fairly straightforward, conventional work of Biblical historical fiction, based on the story of Noah and the months leading up to the Deluge. I call the novel conventional not in a bad sense, but in the sense that it is structured in the manner of much Biblical fiction -- the story centers on real Bible personages and fictionalizes their lives. In this story, Noah and his three sons are portrayed with fictional personalities and foibles. Their wives are also given names and personalities. Neal's story is loosely based on the Biblical account, and greatly elaborated.That said, Neal has done a good job of storytelling. The novel is well-written, the plot is compelling, and the characters are well-drawn, particularly that of the main character Denah, the wife of Japheth in the story.Neal's work is, I believe, independently published. As such, it makes a fine contribution to indie fiction in general. Neal would do well to employ a professional editor, but this is a need in most independent fiction, and her story is well above average in editorial quality.The extensive elaboration on the characters and the lives of revered historical characters seems to me one of the downsides of Biblically-based fiction. My discomfort with that kind of fictionalization has led me to steer away from portrayals of actual Bible personages in my Edhai series, which I center on wholly fictional main characters. One serious lack in most Biblical fiction I also found in \"Blood of Adam\" -- God goes unnamed, or is given a title such as \"The God Who Sees.\" Even during that remote period, God's name, \"YHWH\" (Yahweh or Jehovah), was known and commonly used among his worshipers. It appears in the original text as early as Gen 2:4 and is uttered by the first woman at Gen 4:1.I give \"Blood of Adam\" a cleanness rating of four stars. The story includes some sensuality, but it is not very explicit. Violence occurs, but it is neither pervasive nor very explicit.ARK"}, {"userName": "Valerie Comer", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6016511-valerie-comer", "userReview": "Denah, daughter of Carmi, is betrothed to Japheth, the disgraced son of Noah. She grew up fascinated by Noah\u2019s family, off there just outside of the city, building an ark to save people and animals because his God was going to punish the world with rising waters. As if that could happen.So Denah is torn between her old life and her old gods and the practices of Noah\u2019s family. Her father was raised as a foster brother to Noah and, even though he scoffs at Noah\u2019s beliefs, tells Denah her marriage will right an old wrong. It\u2019s not like she has much choice. If she refuses her father\u2019s choice, she\u2019s cast out of society. She may as well belong to Noah\u2019s family as nowhere.Except there\u2019s the matter of the curse. Neither of Japheth\u2019s sisters-in-law have born children, causing them to be mocked whenever they leave Noah\u2019s land. After a year of infertility, Denah has an idea. There is a goddess of fertility, if only Japheth will agree to seek help with her.What Denah sets in motion catapults her into deceit, blackmail, and betrayal. What if it is true, and Noah\u2019s God really is the One Who Sees? Can she ever be forgiven, before the promised judgment comes?Blood of Adam is the first book in a new series, Generations of Noah. The tale is engaging and well-told, with myriads of layers brought together in the final chapter or two. Each of the major characters, including Methuselah, the oldest man in history, is well-cast, showcasing the era in which they lived and loved. I really enjoyed this tale and look forward to more from this author."}, {"userName": "Vicky Hunt", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10310364-vicky-hunt", "userReview": "More than historical fiction, Rachel Neal weaves a story sweetly reminiscent of Grace & salvation in the church age. There is no preachiness or long-winded sermonizing... just the use of imagination to describe what Noah's family experienced. I particularly liked the way each character had their own faults and inconsistencies. I felt they were basically revealing of the human responses of Christians today to the sins of their Christian brothers. Human nature is well portrayed in a way that sheds light on the events of Noah's days. It also broaches many ethical issues; such as salvation of children, God and the mentally challenged, divorce, forgiveness, and adultry. \"Can you forget it happened? Can you look past her mistakes and see the good in the wife you married?\" -Ham speaking to Japeth  I read the Kindle edition. It was full of spelling & grammatical problems. it appeared that some may have been typos, yet some were mostly problems with subject/verb agreement. it seemed as if the book had not been given the benefit of editing or proof-reading. The problem may be entirely with the Kindle edition, though I have never seen this happen before. Though some sentences do not make sense as written, the reader is able to understand by context cues. so, overall the grammar is easily \"forgiven\" since it does not interfere with reading and enjoying this remarkably perceptive, and dramatically unfolding story of an epic event from the Bible."}, {"userName": "Ellen", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5881438-ellen", "userReview": "Feeling a need to get back into some Biblical fiction, I picked up Blood of Adam for free on the Kindle. Set in the days just prior to the flood, Rachel S. Neal attempts to paint a rich backdrop of the pre-Flood world, complete with culture, anthropology, and even guesses at what the weather might have been like prior to this world-changing, catastrophic event. I liked it for the most part. The setting and plot certainly engaged me, but the characters sometimes jarred me a bit. I had a very hard time with the characterization of Jael, for example. It was difficult for me to see her as such a hard and unforgiving woman. Also, I sometimes lost sight of the characters when they seemed to feel a bit too contemporary. My favorite reads are all character-driven, so this lessened my appreciation of this book somewhat. Although I haven't read it in years, I seem to recall I much preferred Evelyn Minshull's And Then the Rain Came.
