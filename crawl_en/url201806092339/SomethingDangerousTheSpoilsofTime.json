I'm not saying this is classic literature, but an excellent easy beach read? ABSOLUTELY. I was actually hooked on this book to the point of doing nothing else, hiding in the bathroom, just to keep reading while the kids entertained themselves...practically all day. It was a long, 700+ book and I read it in about four and a half days. I was nursing the flu and a cold, and this book couldn't have come at a better time for me.This book picks up about ten years after the first book leaves off and focuses mainly on the second World War and the impact that Hitler had on high society in Europe during this time. This book jumps from London, to New York, to Paris and it does it flawlessly. I love the stories of the characters. I will say that lots of perfect love affairs happen in this book. A little too coincidentally, but there are a few, such as Sebastian and Cecilia that stand the test of time, and I find myself thinking about them and their happiness as if they were real people. Some Characters are brief and fleeting and I even found myself wondering why, but later on in the trilogy, it all ties together, so if you choose to read these books, bear with this and hang on for the long haul. I promise you won't be dissappointed."}, {"userName": "Shannon The Show Stopper ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16205457-shannon-the-show-stopper", "userReview": "This is the second book in the Spoils of Time trilogy and if I had to pick a favorite of the three books, this would it.

At some point, however, I thought I would hurl if one more woman fell violently and eternally in love with a man at a social event. Falling in love in this book is a sharp reaction in the stomach, and if a woman has that symptom, the affair is forever. (Better or worse remains to be seen, but you know the woman won't walk away.) If, however, one slowly comes to appreciate the qualities of another person, the whole thing is probably doomed. I certainly finished the book, and someday I'll read the third book, but I can't say I'm as excited about the whole thing as I was at the end of \"No Angel.\""}, {"userName": "\u2109\u20b3\u2128 ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34027752", "userReview": "Absolutely loved this book !

This book turns out to be the middle book in a trilogy about a family running a publishing house in London. It spans the years from the late 20s to the late 40s, going through the Depression, the war and the aftermath of the war. It's mostly about the relationships and loves of the huge cast of characters associated with this family, and I quite frequently wanted to slap some sense into them, but I couldn't seem to stop reading. This is the weird kind of book where when I'm reading it, I can't put it down, but when I'm not reading it I hardly think about it. It's the sort of glitzy saga that was popular in the late 70s and early 80s, and in the 80s they'd have probably made a TV miniseries out of it. I've heard people calling 50 Shades of Grey \"cracktastic,\" where in spite of how ridiculous it is, you can't help but get caught up in it. I'd call this a higher-brow version of \"cracktastic.\" It's well-written and vividly uses the historic settings, but a lot of the behavior is totally whacked. For instance, the ideal of \"love\" seems to be something you can't help yourself about, that it doesn't matter if he's selfish and unreasonable and maybe a little unbalanced, you can't help how you feel and you're helpless about falling into his spell even though you know it's bad for you -- and this is what true love is. Gag. But then there's the family home turned into a boarding school in the country and the elderly earl drilling the boys to be a home guard and being maybe a little disappointed that there's no invasion, and there's wining and dining and glamour, and there's a mad dash through the streets of London during the Blitz in order to retrieve the sole copy of a manuscript, and it's very easy to get caught up in it all. When I have a free weekend to kick back with a book and a pot of tea, I'll get the previous book in the trilogy because it sounds like it might be rather Downton Abbey-esque, only more insane."}, {"userName": "Robin Nicholas", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1476299-robin-nicholas", "userReview": "The second book in the Lytton trilogy. I love Penny Vincenzi. Her books are filled with strong women, relationships, secrets, and wealth. This type of book can go either way, but because Vincenzi's writing is so strong, this is a really good book. This book concentrates on the late 1920's and the 1930's. It's themes include WWII, Hitler, the Depression, the book publishing business, Paris during the war, etc. Something she does really well is tie her many characters and locations together seamlessly. She has a way of jumping from one conversation taking place in London, to the next paragraph 3 months later in New York, making it all fit together perfectly. Her books are long, 700 pages. However, I can't put them down.

And today I think it's worth an extra star. The second novel of the epic Lytton family saga (it's a very long book!) is set against WW2 and was a can't-put-downer, even though it was occasionally rather predictable and I would have liked to slap a few female characters now and again.  Some people have described this as \"girlcrack\", but I think that's probably a bit too disparaging. Penny Vincenzi conjures up the atmosphere of the time very well and also has the knack of interweaving 3 or 4 stories at a time, and when one ends another begins, so it flows on catching you up in the current."}, {"userName": "Susan Liston", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/630381-susan-liston", "userReview": "3.5. I gave the first in the trilogy, No Angel, three stars, I liked this one a little more. I would have LOVED these books when I was a teenager, and less able to predict various plot points. They are pure soap opera, and I roll my eyes quite a bit, yet I read them. And over 700 pages of tiny print no less. Maybe their Britishness gives them a little more validity, I don't know. It's the same thing as watching Downton Abbey... how many, many times did I scream \"Oh come ON\" at the TV, yet I've seen every episode. There's just no accounting for things sometimes.

The repetition is also found when Barty expresses her feelings for John: \"she liked him more and more\" and twice again \"She liked him more and more\".However apart from this criticism I truly enjoyed this read.

The first quarter needed some severe editing as every character is described in the same exact way and it is beyond bizarre.

The blatant and constant observation of a character's 'sensuality' and 'sexuality' was aggravating and unneeded. Also the constant and repetitive unfaithfulness of almost every male character just didn't seem to do them justice. They deserved better to always have the inclination to cheat on their significant others. AFTER that 25%, the story was incredible.

Vincenzi is just a fabulous example of an author who knows what she's doing.This book had the backdrop of World War II, most of which didn't feel much different to me from the backdrop of World War I in the first novel. One thing that does stand out is that Vincenzi used Celia as an example of how Hitler charmed people and led them to believe his ideas were good, before the tragedy of the War truly began. I thought it was interesting that the author used Celia in this way, particularly as she is the backbone of the Lytton books. There were also more characters involved in the war effort in this book.The twins were the characters who had the most focus in this book, which I think did a lot to stress the effects of the War, but Celia's story remains my favorite. She's the character who interests me the most, so I still enjoyed her parts of the story best. That being said, Adele in particular had some major events that were products of the War and also developed her character dramatically.Lawrence Elliot, a character who was much despised in the first book, makes a bit of a surprise reappearance in this installment, adding a little bit of tension to the book. Relationships between Barty and the New York Lyttons become strained, and this is one of the first times when the reader realizes that Barty actually is human and not perfect. Her relationship with Lawrence added depth to her character and set the scene for her to move forward into the third installment.Overall, I loved the first one just that little bit more, but I loved this one too. The writing is beautiful, the story is fantastic, the characters are all real, and I want the trilogy to never end. Read No Angel first, but definitely pick this one up as well."}], "description": "The dazzling Lytton twins, Adele and Venetia, are born into the great Lytton publishing empire.
