Both Graham Greene (no slouch in this department) and Alfred Hitchcock sing his praises on the cover of this edition. His Journey Into Fear is one of the best books I\u2019ve read in this genre. So how was this one?This book was written in 1938 and Ambler wears his leftist leanings quite comfortably on his sleeve. Two of the major characters are thinly disguised Soviet agents and the whole Commie solidarity thing even gets the protagonists out of a tight spot. Of course, in 1939, Stalin gave the international solidarity movement a swift kick in the nuts when he signed a non-aggression pact with Hitler and then proceeded to carve up Poland with the Nazis and invaded Finland. So, to say its politics are dated would be a gross overstatement.The espionage stuff is pretty well done. An English engineer gets sent to Milan to work in a weapons machine design office. He ends up being run through the paces by the aforementioned Soviet agents, a Nazi agent who fancies make-up, and the Italian OVRA, Mussolini\u2019s secret police. As with a majority of these books, the crap hits the fan and he\u2019s force to flee the country. This is where the book kicks into high gear, as our hero desperately tries to dodge the Fascist black shirted government thugs. Ambler ably ramps up the tension as their methods of escape are taken away one by one.Between working for NASA and Chippendales I took a European vacation, riding the rails from country to country. When the Eurorail train entered Germany, it stopped, the door at the opposite end of the car, opened and two black suited, leather booted, armed German police made a beeline straight to me, ignoring everyone else. Nearly wetting myself, I let them examine my passport. Okay, I wasn\u2019t a master criminal on the lam, but that was scary for all of two minutes.

Absolutely", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2156200-k-d-absolutely", "userReview": "Cause for Alarm has all the ingredients of a typical WWII British espionage novel. Think John le Carre, Ken Follett, Frederick Forsyth, Jeffrey Archer, etc. There are plenty of those British writers who specialize on spy novels during that time in Europe and I could have easily given this at least a 3-star rating. Not only because I like spy novels but also because they are about World War II in Europe. I am a sucker for anything about Hitler, Fascism, Nazi, etc.But I am giving this only a 2-star because I was expecting this to be better than the usual ones. Why? This novel has been among the books included in the 1001 Books from 2006, 2008 up to 2010 and so when I picked this up, I thought that I would be blown away. I was not. Maybe there is an editor in the Boxall's selection committee who read this in 1938 and liked it so much and that he now insists that this should not be dropped from the list. This is the same reason why one of my friends here in Goodreads still insists that Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist is an excellent novel. The reason is that it was his the very first novel that he read from cover to cover when he was in high school. Now that he is a voracious reader, he will always give the credit to that Coelho book even if in reality, the novel is nothing but mediocre. At least for me, my first novel in high school was Nabokov's Lolita and there is nothing mediocre about it.Is there anything different from this novel compared to let's say Le Carre's opus, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold or Ken Follett's Eye of the Needle? Nothing. These two books are even superior than this. The reason for that is Le Carre in Spy portrayed the protagonist as vulnerable and with weaknesses like a normal human being which is different from the usual James Bond who is confident, virile, smart and all-knowing. On the other hand, Follett in his most famous spy novel Eye is noteworthy because he incorporated treachery within a family living in a small isolated island with WWII as a backdrop and not being in the midst of the region's power political struggle.Here in Cause for Alarm, the story revolves around Nick Marlow (yes, similar to the surname of that guy who ranked the human needs) who losses his job in London because of global recession. The timing sucks because a day prior to his layoff, he proposed to his fiancee. Without a job, he postponed the wedding and his job has brought him to Italy to work in a company that manufactures and supplies materials for ammunition. As you know, Italy was an ally of Germany during the war and it is against France, England and Russia. So, for an Englishman in Italy during that time is already not right in the first place and yet Marlow (because of his needs?) goes there to work. All for the name of love, I guess.Also, unlike the novels of Le Carre and Follett, the plot of the book is thinner and the climax seems not to have reached its peak at the end. It is almost like a monotone song. The scene in the train while Nick and his American friend Zaleshoff (who I thought should have been given an American name like Smith or Brown so it would not be confusing) are fleeing Italy on their way to Yugoslavian border is supposed to be the climax but I did not feel scared for them. There was no gripping edge-of-your-seat scene not typical of your other favorite spy novels. The angle of the separated lovers trying to prepare for the wedding could have been used to its advantage in terms of thickening the plot a bit by let's say having the main office of the company in London abduct the girlfriend in order for Taylor to surrender and turn himself to the Italian police. You see, if your target audience is composed of the hardcore spy-novel readers/lovers, you can concoct anything as long as it is engaging and plausible and you will make this type of readers happy. Although the book is readable and uses straight, guy-friendly \"no-frills\" narration, the plot is just so typical and there is nothing extraordinary about it.My cause for alarm is if this book is retained in the 1001 list when Boxall releases its new edition this year, 2012."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18948588-kim", "userReview": "\"Cause for Alarm\" is a novel by Eric Ambler first published in 1938. Set in Italy in the same year, the book is one of Ambler's classic spy thrillers. For a person who isn't a big fan of spy thrillers classic or otherwise I sure end up reading a lot of them. This one I enjoyed. I looked up Eric Ambler and found that he was a British author of spy novels who used the pseudonym Eliot Reed for books co-written with Charles Rodda. I wonder why he did that and I also wonder why Charles Rodda didn't get any credit. Maybe he did I'll have to go look him up too---I have just spent ten minutes looking for Charles Rodda and have found nothing so far (poor guy) so I decided to return to the book and the man who wrote this book and I'll continue my search later.  I thought it was interesting that Ambler's parents were entertainers who ran a puppet show. It isn't very often I find an author that was born into a puppet show, I wonder if that was a fun childhood. Ambler helped with the show when young but eventually studied engineering, wrote plays and was a copywriter at an advertising agency. In the 1930's One of the things I read about Ambler was that he was \"a staunch anti-Fascist and regarded the Soviet Union as the only real counterweight to fascist aggression \u2013 which was why some of his early books include Soviet agents depicted positively and as sympathetic characters. \"Cause for Alarm\" didn't seem to have any positive and sympathetic Soviet characters running around in it so I guess it came after he changed his mind about the Soviet Union. That change was caused by the Nazi-Soviet Pact of 1939 although come to think of it, that was a year later than the book was written. Another mystery for me to figure out. Now that I have all kinds of interesting things to look up - I do seem to get off track at times - I will try to get my mind back to the book.Ok, let's see if I get this right. On the very first page we have a mysterious man (of course) standing in the shadow of a doorway stamping his numb feet on the damp stones. It's cold and this is one of those people who don't like the cold so he stands there thinking awful things while he waits. After thinking of how cold and damp it is, with fogs rolling in from the ricefields, fog rolling in that also brings in the smoke from the factories, he starts wishing that they would have just let his kill this \"Englishman\" easily and quickly. \"A knife under the ribs, a slight twist of the wrist to let the air inside the wound, and it was done. No fuss, no trouble, practically no noise.\"He stands in the doorway and when a stray pedestrian comes along he shrinks back into the shadows, but of the policemen he takes no notice, the police deliberately avoid looking his way. \"That was one advantage in working for Them. You didn't have to worry about the police. You were safe.\" A second mystery, who are They? Finally a man comes out of the office building across the street, stops to \"light a cigarette\" - remember that - and steps into the street where is he promptly run over twice by the same car. So the mystery guy in the doorway has just killed the mystery guy in the office building and now the Prologue is over and we move on to the first chapter. I wonder why prologue is pronounced nothing like it is spelled, like bologna - I always have to do the Oscar Mayer song in my head to spell bologna. Anyway, on to the story.The first paragraph says this:\"One thing is certain. I would not even have considered the job if I had not been desperate.\"Hmm....now that I see that it doesn't seem like \"One thing is certain\" is an entire sentence, but I'm not an English teacher. Anyway, our main character, a production engineer named Nicholas Marlow has just lost his job \"owing to circumstances beyond the control of the Board\" - business is slow and labour is too expensive so near London, so the book says anyway. What makes it worse, other than starving to death without a job is that Nick has just proposed to Claire - I can't remember her last name at the moment, but she is a surgeon which is good for the stopping the starving to death possibility. After over two months of looking for another job, he responds to an advertisement by an English engineering company, the \"Spartacus Machine Tool Company\". He is offered the post of the firm's representative in Italy. The company's main sales are of the \"Spartacus Type S2 automatic\" which according to the book is:\"a high-speed automatic machine for shell production.\"Making these things and selling them to Italy doesn't seem like the most brilliant thing for an company from England to do, but Nick needs a job so he takes it. He is told that the man who had the job before him was killed while walking home on a foggy night - he was hit by an automobile and the driver didn't even stop, a \"very sad affair\".Once he gets there he runs into all kinds of interesting people. There is the American man he meets in the building where he works who wants him to spy on another man who is Russian but may be German, for that matter the American may be Russian. There is an English man spying on the Italians and Italians spying on the Germans and Germans spying on the Italians, even though the countries are friendly they still spy on each other. Oh, and there are the Fascist Italian secret police, they follow everybody. In this book if you aren't spying on someone you certainly are getting spied on, perhaps you're doing both. It was very entertaining and I enjoyed it.Now on to the two things that stood out to me. Remember I told you to keep \"light a cigarette\" in mind. Here are some quotes:\"He felt in his jacket pocket, lit a cigarette, rebuttoned his overcoat and started to walk in the opposite direction.\"\"I offered him a cigarette. We went on talking.\"\"I put the paper down, finished my tea and felt in my pocket for a match to light my cigarette.\"\"I went for a short walk, smoked a couple of cigarettes, sat down and replied to both letters.\"\"I yawned and wondered whether to turn the bath on right away or smoke a final cigarette.\"\"He got out a bottle of cognac, half-filled two wine glasses with it and pushed a box of cigarettes towards me.\"Ok, I'll stop with the cigarettes, I just thought that these people couldn't move without having a cigarette and I'm not sure how they breathed actual air with them. Then there is this:\"He got out a bottle of cognac....\"\"He found a table near one of the heating stoves and ordered a caffe latte and a Strega. The spirit he drank at a gulp.\"\"Her father gave me a whiskey and soda.....\"\"He sniffed at his cognac and I saw his lips twist into an expression of wry distaste.\"\"A glass of champagne? \"Thank you.\"\"Brandy Mr. Marlow? \"Thank you.\"\"Whisky?\" \"I got a bottle in specially.\"\"You'd better take the brandy.\"Ok, once again I'll stop. Whenever anyone had a conversation with a spy or a possible spy they had a drink (and a cigarette), the same thing to relax, the same thing to stop relaxing and get to work. I was a little puzzled as to why everyone was so worried about what everyone else was doing or what government they may be working for, with all the smoking and drinking they should soon all die of one disease or another anyway. Either that or get run over. I liked the book go ahead and read it."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth (Alaska)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2026178-elizabeth-alaska", "userReview": "What fascinated me most about this was it's publication date of 1938. The Axis of Germany and Italy had recently been established - the villain of this piece was one German in particular, and also the general fascist movement in Italy. The protagonist is an ordinary Englishman, an engineer. Not surprisingly, characterization is not the primary draw, though not just awful either. The prose is perhaps not quite literary quality, but more than acceptable. The plot and its development good. This is one of Ambler's earlier pieces.

It tells the story of an Englishman Nick Marlow who gets involved in a high stake game of espionage in Fascist Italy just before the Second World War. Marlow is an engineer who is made redundant from a London factory and due to the great depression finds it impossible to land a new job in England. Out of desperation he accepts a job as a Milan based sales representative of a British company that makes machinery for the manufacture of grenades.Ambler writes in a classic hardboiled style that is very appealing to me. His sentences are short and they move the story forward like a steamroller. The style and especially the dialogue remind me of the great hardboiled masters Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett. Maybe the only major difference to Chandler and Hammett is that Ambler is a bit more serious writer. That must be because he was British and his subject matter was the lead up to the Second World War. The situation in Europe at that time was a bit more serious than it was in California. It would be interesting to know whether Chandler had read Ambler and this book in particular as he named his hero Marlowe.The first two thirds of the book build up the suspense as Marlow gets tangled in the web of deception and corruption of German and Soviet spies and the Fascist Italian secret police. The atmosphere of the moist and foggy winter months of Milan is beautifully captured. However, it is the escape from Milan through the North Eastern Italy to safety in Yugoslavia, after the Italian authorities discover the plot that Marlow is mixed in, which forms the best part of the book. The escape is told in such a gripping way that one's own heart races along with the protagonist and it is difficult to keep one from skipping the pages just to find out how it will all end. It ends well of course but there are some really hair-raising moments on the way to safety which make this a gripping suspense story."}, {"userName": "Procyon Lotor", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4755185-procyon-lotor", "userReview": "Particolare e plausibile spy-story ambientata a Milano sul finire degli anni '30 con triplogiochisti e autorit\ufffd corrotte..

According to Wikipedia, Ambler is known for his thrillers. I can't say I was thrilled at any stage while reading this lame account of a particularly pathetic British engineer who ends up the victim of espionage agents in pre-WW2 Fascist Italy.Apart from wanting to punch the \"hero\" in the face on virtually every page, the storyline is utterly predictable with the only twists being ones where the plot gets lost in some kind of bog while you wait for anything remotely thrilling to happen. The somewhat ironically named Marlow - ironic because he's the complete opposite of Chandler's Philip Marlowe - spends the whole time acting like a paranoid tourist with the backbone of C3PO. Quite how Zalashoff, the Russian agent who effectively saves him, manages to resist putting a bullet through his head is beyond me.What Ambler's done here is what others, such as Buchan, failed to do: create a thriller with a hero who lacks any of the heroic characteristics that were obligatory for thrillers in Ambler's pre-WW2 era. Now, while this may have been a bold move and undoubtedly influenced the realism embodied in titans such as George Smiley, the fact that the genre was suffering from malaise at the time meant that Ambler got away with it. But while the central character is as realistic as you or me, the storyline is still completely implausible, which is after all what readers of spy novels want.So, as with many writers who influenced those who have become household names, you're probably better off reading those they influenced and learning about their legacy from their Wikipedia posts.

One of my favourite writers of the form is Eric Ambler, whose novels started to appear in the 1930s. His work has an air of realism about it that seems to me to be missing from the more gung-ho stories of his predecessors such as Sapper, John Buchan and Dornford Yates. In fact, Ambler started a trend for engaging, historically and politically aware, credible spy fiction that has since given us such wonderful writers as John Le Carre, Len Deighton, Charles McCarry, Charles Cumming, Edward Wilson and (perhaps Ambler's closest modern equivalent) Alan Furst. 'Cause for Alarm' may not be its author's best book (of those I've read 'The Mask of Dimitrios' is perhaps his most effective thriller). But it's nevertheless a reasonably good read that, for the most part, bears many of Ambler's trademark qualities: a fascinating plot; a page-turning readability; excellent characterisation; and a strong sense of time and place. 'Cause for Alarm' is a novel that you are likely to want to gobble up as quickly as possible because it hooks you from the outset. Its only disappointing feature is the rather weak d\u00e9nouement (of which more later).It would be unfair to reveal too much of the plot. In brief, the story features a young unemployed Brit, Nicky Marlow, who takes a job at an overseas arm of a British armaments producer, in Italy, in the late 1930s. While in Milan, he becomes inadvertently embroiled in the underhand activities of pro and anti Fascist activists. So, as in several of Ambler's other stories, the basic premise is that of an ordinary guy who finds himself caught up in extraordinary events that test his survival instinct. What I particularly like about 'Cause for Alarm' is its political astuteness. The relationship between Germany and Italy - the Rome-Berlin axis that was formed in the latter half of the 1930s - provides a backdrop to the plot and there is a tangible sense of the looming war that would shatter Europe just a few years later. The central character, Nicky Marlow, is one that most readers will warm to. He's a plucky, naive and slightly vulnerable young man who almost immediately finds himself involved in a series of events that are quite beyond his control. There's a smattering of offbeat humour too. One of the more sinister characters in the story is described as having an effeminate voice and a penchant for wearing rouge on his cheeks! Unfortunately, the novel has one major flaw: its conclusion. The last third of the book, in which Marlow attempts to evade Italian police and secret service officials who are trying to arrest him, is unbelievably silly and quite out of keeping with everything that precedes it. I was simply not convinced by it. And it disrupts the balance and ethos of the story. What had been a quietly effective, thoughtful and intriguing spy yarn morphs into some sort of formulaic Hollywood film script for a closing chase scene. At one point when on the run, while having a drink with his accomplice in a cafe, Marlow even gets to hear a radio newsflash about himself and the fact that he is wanted for questioning by the authorities! He also takes refuge with a slightly unhinged mathematics professor who is obsessed with the issue of perpetual motion. All very silly! It's a great shame that what had up until then been a riveting read loses its way in the final 100 or so pages. Eric Ambler had a knack of writing in a way that makes you turn the pages avidly, eager to know what happens next. There are many modern writers who need to learn that particular skill. Ambler's stories satisfy the yearning we all have for a good story, well told. The ill-judged ending apart, 'Cause for Alarm' exemplifies its author's finely-honed storytelling skills. Despite the poor d\u00e9nouement, I liked it. 6/10."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1478144-john", "userReview": "Machine engineer Nicky Marlow finds himself out of a job and, in a time of recession, can't find another . . . until the Spartacus company hires him to take over their Milan office following the tragic hit-and-run death of their previous manager there.

After I'd finished the novel, delighted to have made the reacquaintance, I realized how very simple the plot actually is: you could probably tell the whole tale quite adequately on one side of a sheet of paper. It's part of Ambler's great mastery that, even so, he kept me entirely engrossed throughout. The sense that everything is just about to come crashing down around Europe's ears is very strong (in this the book's prophetic; it appeared in 1938), as is the depiction, through the often infuriating figure of Nicky, of English complacency in the face of the storm that was building.Much recommended.*******Although originally published in the UK in 1938, this came out in the US in 1939 and thus just squeaks in as a candidate for Rich Westwood's 1939 Challenge on his Past Offences site.My other contribution to the Challenge is a piece on the 1939 Powell & Pressburger movie \nThe Spy in Black\n at my Noirish site."}, {"userName": "Corey", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/915487-corey", "userReview": "I love Ambler.

I do have one or two problems with this book, for which I deduct a star. For example, Vagas's sudden flight is not adequately explained. Nor are Zaleshoff's motives or background. We only have the word of Vagas for what we know, and Marlow seems peculiarly uninterested in his benefactor. Overall I get the feeling that Ambler may have rushed this one a little. It's not his best work.Still, any Ambler novel is a good read for looking to escape into an interesting and fun espionage thriller. Ambler's intelligence and erudition lifts all of his work far above the level of the dime-a-dozen spy novels that clutter high street bookshops, and he fully deserves the praise heaped upon him by his notable fans: Hitchcock, le Carre, et al."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21592978-john", "userReview": "Setting was good - pre-WWII - but thought the plot was a bit too straightforward - kept waiting for a twist but everything was as it was presented.

I would not even have considered the job if I had not been desperate.\u201dIt\u2019s not the first line of Eric Ambler\u2019s 1938 thriller Cause For Alarm, but the first line of the first chapter, and one of the most telling, most generally descriptive of all his tales: characters being forced into the uncomfortable and unfamiliar out of desperation. In this novel, engineer Nicholas Marlow is let go from work right before he\u2019s getting ready to be married, so he takes employment in a job abroad in Italy for a British-owned machine shop and supplier of miscellaneous goods. As it\u2019s only a temporary venture in his mind, long enough for him to save his money for the marriage, he doesn\u2019t delve into the details and only vaguely considers the morality of his position: the equipment his company handles is not weaponry, but it\u2019s considered essential to the construction of war machinery, and the customers who purchase it were part of the growing number of right-wing, my-country-first, extremists who were threatening to bring Europe into a second world war. He begins to pay more attention to the morality when peculiar characters intrude more frequently into what he hoped would be routine, and then he finds out his predecessor may have been murdered, and then\u2026Ambler is considered one of the fathers of the modern political thriller, a big influence on later writers like Graham Greene and John LeCarre -- his work is most easily compared to Hitchcock films, where a normal Jane or Joe stumbles into a situation beyond their control or understanding. Who do they trust? How can they survive? What will they be like when they\u2019re through the peril and come out on the other side? All of his novels of the 1930s are worth checking out -- especially Journey Into Fear and A Coffin For Dimitrios -- giving us not only gripping and well-written stories, but also vivid sepia snapshots of the times in which they were written."}, {"userName": "Tony", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1361000-tony", "userReview": "Ambler, Eric. CAUSE FOR ALARM. (1938). ****. About twenty pages into this thriller from Ambler, I realized that I had read it before \u2013 but it must have been so long ago that my recall was about two pages behind the written word. It is a typical Ambler thriller: Someone who is not a spy or an operative of any kind is caught up in a web of intrigue through which he must navigate to come out the end in one piece. In this case, our hero is Nick Marlow, an engineer who is out of work because his employer has made him redundant in those slow times in the late 1930s in England. His girlfriend is supportive, but after about three months of no luck, he finally takes a job with a firm that has a branch in Milan. It seems that they need a man who has an engineering background and who can speak Italian to head up that branch because the previous manager was killed by a hit-and-run driver. He\u2019d have to spend a year over there, but after that year, he\u2019d have enough money to get married and was sure that something else would turn up. Once in Milan, however, he discovers the Italian way of doing business, where bribes and rake-offs are common currency. He is approached by two different men who offer to help him gain business for his employer, Spartacus Machine Tool \u2013 manufacturer of equipment used to make armaments. Both men, it turns out, are working for separate governments who are after information that Marlow can easily obtain because of his access to armament manufacturers throughout Italy. Thinking that that was the way to get business, Marlow takes the bait, then finds himself caught in a web of intrigue that he must get himself out of to ultimately maintain his professional integrity and ultimately his life. This is another fast-paced Ambler espionage novel that will keep you turning the pages.

I liked the beginning of the book, because like most thrillers and mysteries it gave a good view of contemporary life, in this case Europe in the 1930s and the growth of fascism and the lead-up to WWII. Nick Marlow, a British engineer, gets a job representing a firm in Milan and winds up entangled in bribery and espionage mostly because he's stubborn and rather naive when it comes to politics. I enjoyed reading this part because it felt rather true to what would happen when an outsider ended up becoming involved in that sort of situation and had no idea how to get out of it. The part that lost my interest was when Marlow ends up accused of bribery by the Italian state and has to escape the country while being hunted down by the police. The problem is that I've read and seen a lot of books and movies about innocent people who are forced to flee while being followed by dangerous people, and this book didn't contain anything very new and exciting. This may partly have been because this book was written before this scenario had become so common and partly because Marlow would never have gotten out by himself and his co-conspirator Zaleshoff had to more or less drag him out of the country against his will.Still, the book was worth reading mostly because I liked seeing Marlow trying to do business in a corrupt and fascist Milan more or less against his will, but his escape was a bit too formulaic and mostly accomplished by someone else."}, {"userName": "Marc", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2732885-marc", "userReview": "It's the late 1930s (1938?), and English narrator Marlow has just lost his job as a factory production manager. Eager for employment (he is engaged to be married), he applies for and accepts an unlikely position: to serve as the Milan representative of an English armaments manufacturer. Having just entered into the Axis alliance with Nazi Germany, Italy is a hotbed of espionage, and Marlow, because of his access to Italian weapons factories, immediately attracts the attentions of various spies as well as the Italian secret police.Marlow is a likeable narrator and a competent engineer, but he doesn't know the first thing about spycraft, and he's prone to impulsive decisions as well, so he soon gets himself into some trouble. As the plot thickens and the tension builds, we worry that Marlow may meet the same fate as his predecessor, who was the victim of a vehicular manslaughter (which we see in a brief prologue).Typical of Ambler, this book has engaging and memorable characters and a vivid setting, and the pacing carries us along quickly -- at times, pulse-poundingly. But overall it falls one star short of perfect because it relies too heavily on dialogue: too much of the story is related to us through conversations between characters, too little actually shown to us through action.

The premise: in 1937, British engineer Nicky Marlow accepts a job in fascist Italy at a Brit-owned manufacturing firm specializing in machines for shell production. Marlow soon finds himself being courted by mysterious men with secret (and opposing) agendas \u2013 and at least one of whom may be responsible for the death of Marlow\u2019s predecessor. Similar to the hero in Ambler\u2019s Epitaph For A Spy (the first Ambler book I read), Marlow is so infuriatingly na\u00efve about his situation \u2013 and so easily offended at the slightest impropriety \u2013 that he\u2019s a hard protagonist to like. At the same time, his character is partly drawn as a critique of arms manufacturers who treat war as just a business or a newspaper headline \u2013 Marlow is thrown into a situation intended to burst that bubble. In any case, Ambler tells a good tale, albeit at a slightly uneven pace. The only significant complaint I have is that the opening pages of Marlow\u2019s narrative create a set-up that never meaningfully pays off \u2013 so much so that it seems superfluous. Luckily, there\u2019s more than enough here to make up for it."}, {"userName": "Al", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/733624-al", "userReview": "I guess when you write as many books as Eric Ambler did, you tend to fall into a pattern. Cause For Alarm is definitely formulaic, which is both good and bad. It has the usual realistic and beautifully rendered locations, and the typical cast of nysterious characters; these are good things. I do wish that the usual naive English protagonist would eventually wise up, or at least realize what he is getting into. But if he can't do that, could he please spare us the all-too-frequent outbursts of injured pride and indignation when things aren't going his way? Well, no, I guess he can't, so we'll just have to take the good with the bad. Mr. Ambler figured these protestations were necessary to his plots, but I just wish we could dispense with them and get on with the story. As an aside, it's so interesting to realize these books were written from 1937 to 1940 -- mostly, then, before the war had fairly begun -- but Mr. Ambler clearly foresaw what was coming. The impending menace of the war in the books is palpable.

He is pursued by a buffoonish General Vagas to supply information about the armament factories he visits trying to sell his machines. It appears that the only reliable friend he has is Zaleshoff, a supposed American businessman, with very interesting political views.
