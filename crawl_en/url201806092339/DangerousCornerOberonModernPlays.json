Then watched the Soviet 1972 film of it, and it was a masterpiece (though, there is a variant where they cut \"the gay\" out of there, I'm not sure what the audience was supposed to think). Anyway, polished it with reading the play and dear me, it still cuts deeply. Everyone lies and everyone loves, and it doesn't make them good or bad people.

(1932). J. B. Priestly. ****.\tIt is difficult finding Priestley\u2019s works anymore. He was a prolific writer, but has apparently gone out of style for today\u2019s readers and theatergoers. This is an excellent drama that explores truth, lies, and guilt. We meet all of the principals in the opening scene. They are all members of the same firm, having a dinner together at the country house belonging to one of the partners. There are three married couples and two single people, one a man and one a woman. Dinner is over and the women are gathered in the sitting room, while the men are in the next room smoking and taking an after dinner port. The women are discussing the up-coming publication of a new novel, titled, \u201cThe Sleeping Dog.\u201d It is decided that the sleeping dog in the title refers to \u201ctruth.\u201d We are startled by the sound of a gunshot in the next room. It is simply one of the men showing off his pistol to the rest of the men by shooting out of a window at a flower pot. The men then join the ladies and explain what happened. No big deal. A box containing cigarettes is passed around. It\u2019s a music box that plays the Wedding March. That box moves the conversation on to the provenance of the box. It had belonged to one of the partners who, a year ago, had committed suicide by shooting himself. He was a highly liked member of the group, and each of the guests begins to contribute tidbits about him and the possible reasons for the suicide itself. It was assumed that he had killed himself over some money taken from the firm. He was likely depressed anyway, and the guilt overwhelmed him. We soon see, however, that presumptions of guilt over the theft are very wrong, and opinions, at first, then facts come out from all of the members of the group that throw doubt on the suicide\u2019s guilt. What ultimately happens is that the real thief is revealed and the real cause of death is revealed. This is all carried out with a realism that makes the scene totally believable. When you think the play is over, and that all has been bared, the author plays a clever trick on us. A shot comes from the next room, and, once again the excuse of shooting at a flower pot is used. Cigarettes are once again passed around using the music box. This time, however, no comments are made on the box or its association with the suicide. The author offers us an alternate ending where the \u201csleeping dog\u201d is left alone, and the \u201cdangerous corner\u201d is avoided. Priestly once again demonstrates his cerebral style of writing and manages to pull the reader into a world that may or may not exist.

They are bonded by family or business ties. As Freda Caplan (Robert's wife) offers Olwen Peel (a close friend) a cigarette, Olwen makes a throw away remark that she has seen the box before. Freda, who is in possession of the box because she took it from her deceased brother-in-laws house the night he died, knows it is impossible that Olwen has seen the box, because Freda, in love with her Brother-in-law, had given it to him only hours before he died. Freda becomes interested in how Olwen could have seen the box and what she was doing with Martin just before he died. As each character is forced through exposure by someone who is guilty, but innocent of their section of the story, to reveal their secrets, the facade of the cheerful group is destroyed as are the lives of those in the room. The play then ends with the exact same moment Freda offered Olwen the cigarette, only this time, Olwen\u2019s comment is drowned out, Freda misses it, and the night continues to mask the deadly secrets we now know each character hides.This is Priestly\u2019s point, that the facade is not only about what we are revealing (that is what we wish were true about ourselves) but also what we are concealing. With a particular tilt of a cigarette box, a string of discussions and questions reveals not just affairs, thefts and counter-affairs, but unrequited loves, homosexuality and drug abuse. Priestley\u2019s intention is for us to see the precarious nature of middle class safety, and the way that each individual fits in to an overlaying narrative that is the very essence of the upper middle class. That the narrative is kept in place by the very behavior that would also destroy it. This narrative, or story of what a respectable upper class should be is a lie (of course) but because of the nature of each others hidden falls from grace, it is a secret lie, with each individual doing more to uphold its image depending on how far they are from it in reality."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4212257-jennifer", "userReview": "This play is BRILLIANT.

Priestley was a popular, prolific British novelist and playwright who lived from 1894 to 1984 and whose most successful writing years seemed to be from 1930 to 1950. He also had a political career.To me, he seemed most comfortable at writing comedy, but his two best known plays, An Inspector Calls and Time and the Conways are dramas. He also seemed better at creating male characters than female.This is another one of his five time plays -- plays that experiment with flexible time, mixing the past, present, and future -- and to me, it's another of his less successful ones. It also may be his earliest in the mode, so you can partly excuse it by saying he was still working things out. The script mostly turns on a gimmick, and the stereotyped characters yell a lot, without having any new or real reasons to make all that noise. There's a bit of O'Neill's influence here, too -- that people's inner thoughts don't represent their outer ones -- and Priestly does it faster, and maybe with a bit less ponderousness, but with no greater depth than O'Neill. The problem is that we all know that what we think isn't always what we say, so finding out that other people's minds work the same way is no big surprise, and we don't need a writer, actors, and a theater to make that discovery."}, {"userName": "Nicole Murdoch", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21631588-nicole-murdoch", "userReview": "Another applause for JB Priestley, I adored An Inspector Calls and I was really excited to study this book at school.

Or to put it in the play's terms, if we let sleeping dogs lie? Despite this, there is very little action to keep things moving along, and the massive amounts of dialogue can make the play plod a bit. Also the characters are entirely unsympathetic; I made the comparison to Waiting for Godot, in that the character you most want to meet never actually appears on stage. Martin is clearly the most interesting person in the play, but we never actually get to meet him, which is a shame. The other characters are all so unsympathetic that it's hard to feel too much for them. Nevertheless, an interesting premise that is reasonably well carried out, it's just hampered a bit by its own wordiness."}, {"userName": "Bruno Oliveira", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7234565-bruno-oliveira", "userReview": "N\u00e3o.
