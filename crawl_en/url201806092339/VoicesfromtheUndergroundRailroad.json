Their master is a drunk and abuser while the wife abuses the young girl who works in the house. Jed is able to work at a local shop but quickly realizes that because the family needs money, they will be sold and likely to different homes. They escape in the night and make their way through dangerous territory with bounty hunters out to get them. The portrayal is realistic and the prose compliments the story wonderfully with the pictures while explaining the delicate dance the conductors played on the railroad and how near death they always came. The book has a happy resolution that is neither here nor there but the fear of them being caught propels readers forward."}, {"userName": "Sally", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/746637-sally", "userReview": "One of the more effective books in the \"Voices from\" series. An exciting story about a historical period."}, {"userName": "April", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44302834-april", "userReview": "This story follows Jeb and Mattie; siblings who are about to attempt to flee slavery in Maryland and use the network of good people and hiding places known as the Underground Railroad to make their way north to where their older brother Ben is supposed to be living in Massachusetts. The illustrations fit the tone and the text reads/looks nearly like a poem. The tension of why the two need to leave is there and not avoided. Each short section is from the point of view of a different character (with Jeb and Mattie being repeated most often but small parts being detailed by others helping (or hunting!) the two). Historical notes, references, and books for kids to read further are listed at the back. The inside covers have a nice map of the journey. Anything you didn\u2019t like about it? The pages from the Point of View of the wife of the slave owner was a strange addition but serves to highlight a few slight variations on thoughts/behaviors of those supporting the institution of slavery. Otherwise, I was really impressed by the combination of text and illustrations that keep the tension but aren't gory or too much for young eyes who may be using this book as their first introduction to the topic. To whom would you recommend this book? (Read-alikes if you can think of them) Good for an introduction to the concept of the Underground Railroad and also for the historical notes at the end which diverge from most books glorifying the white saviors to shine more light on what recent research increasingly reveals to have been a large influence of free blacks and other escaped slaves.FTC Disclosure: The Publisher provided me with a copy of this book to provide an honest review. No goody bags, sponsorship, \u201cmaterial connections,\u201d or bribes were exchanged for my review."}, {"userName": "Cindy Mitchell *Kiss the Book*", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19521241-cindy-mitchell-kiss-the-book", "userReview": "Winters, Kay Voices from the Underground Railroad, illustrated by Larry Day. PICTURE BOOK. Dial (Penguin), 2018. $19. 9780803740921This book tells the fictional story of a young brother and sister escaping from slavery via the underground railroad. The narrative is told in a rotating perspective that includes the escaping pair, the slave holder, the operative, the slave catchers and more. The appendix includes many historical notes and terminology. Feature large dark illustrations.The interesting perspectives in this book will help readers to understand the various roles that went into the underground railroad (and those against it). I found myself so involved with the story that I was startled to hear real life happening around me. I did not care for the illustrations, they were sloppy and give the book (especially the cover) a dated look that will make it unappealing to readers. I think this book would best be brought to life for a class by a 3rd-6th grade teacher. EL \u2013 ADVISABLE.
