The problem is, this series is like crack. I know it is not good for me, but I'm addicted. Hi my name is Badseedgirl, and I'm a Mike Talbot addict. It could be, I'm a Mark Tufo addict, it's hard to tell because, so far I have only read his Zombie Fallout series. Zombie Fallout is so wrong in all the right ways. The writing is simplistic, but the plot is long, drawn-out, and convoluted. Every part of this series should have me throwing my hands up in disgust, but I can't and I won't because I LOVE this series so very, very much. Why do I love this series, the characters. I have a real commitment to all Mr. Tufo's characters. I feel I am a member of the Talbot family and I plan to follow their completely unbelievable, action packed adventures to the brutal zombie filled end.Oh yeah, book eight left with a HUGE, Ginormous, cliff hanger, and I've already got book nine in my overdrive bookshelf."}, {"userName": "Shana Festa", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9185553-shana-festa", "userReview": "Reading this, my fifteenth Tufo book, I had an ah-ha moment. Something I'd never paid any attention to before. One of the reasons I think Tufo's writing resonates so well with me is that while he writes in first person narration, he still manages to sneak in some inner dialog of other characters. This, for me, really helps round out his already three-dimensional characters.Only Tufo can introduce the Knights Templar & Illuminati into a story with zombies, vampires, and corrupt old hags, and make it work. I enjoy Tufo's ZF series so much, that I always reread the previous book before starting a new one so I make sure I'm completely caught up and the story is fresh in my mind.If you're not reading Tufo yet, you need to be. The dialog is always fresh, able to make me laugh out loud, and when I'm done, I'm always ready for seconds."}, {"userName": "Albert Yates", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14289020-albert-yates", "userReview": "All right, Mike Talbot is back... and he's being held prisoner.

Mike\u2019s lifelong friend, Dennis, had this misfortune crossing paths with Mrs. Deneaux. Who, to no one\u2019s surprise, ends up double-crossed and in a jail cell.Now Mike is trapped in a box of iron bars. On the bright side, he has his old buddy Dennis for company. However, he has no idea what has come of his family. (*Spoiler Alert* He is not happy about it.) Enter Dixon Hauss, the man behind the tainted flu vaccine, and power hungry ego-maniac with a god complex; he wants Talbot\u2019s blood and he\u2019ll do whatever it takes, including threatening Mike\u2019s family. (*Spoiler Alert* This does not change his.) Fast forward a couple hours; Tommy has infiltrated the building, Mike\u2019s family is in a car and heading out of harm\u2019s way, and Mr. Talbot has a gun and a couple hostages. Of course with Mike Talbot, you know things can\u2019t stay in his favor for long. Low and behold, just in time to ruin all his fun, Vivian Deneaux\u2019s voice creaks over the intercom system. (*Spoil\u2026.well, I think you get the picture.) With Dixon hoodwinked by Deneaux, Mike\u2019s only friends are his enemies. Tommy and Mike must make their way out of a secured facility with the only aid being that of the man trying to rule the world and his lackey for hire while surrounded by trained mercenaries trying to kill them; sounds about right. Meanwhile, Tracy and the rest of the gang cross paths with a historical faction that have a plan that may very well risk Mike and Tommy\u2019s lives.I am all but certain I have said this on more than one Zombie Fallout review, but I love this series! I will probably type out the same exact phrase when I review the upcoming Book 9. It is such a fun series; it\u2019s full of action, always has an entertaining plot, changes things up for variety, and has some of the deepest characters that I have read. That is what draws me back every time, the characters. Mark Tufo has some of the most underappreciated writing skills that I have had the pleasure of consuming. I don\u2019t know why they don\u2019t, but more people should know his name. My favorite aspect is his exceptional grasp of human emotion. He understands why things are important. It\u2019s apparent in every flashback, every reunion with a loved one, every death. He knows the location of every sad button and funny bone. Add to that the dialogue between any two of the Talbot family, extended family included, which is delightful. Some light-hearted ribbing, a little (okay, a lot) of dark humor but most of all, love and connection. All of that is delivered with perfection by the narrator, Sean Runette.I\u2019m convinced Sean Runette and Marc Tufo are twins separated at birth, or soul mates of some kind. Runette delivers the words with the same passion that they are written, adding more feeling and depth to a world already chalk full of both. I have nothing negative to say about his narration; he delivers consistent performances throughout every book, there is no background noise or unwanted sounds, and the production quality is as good as any I have heard. Podium PuAll-in-all this is a series that needs to be checked out by pretty much anyone. If the zombie niche isn\u2019t your thing, I suggest listening to book one with an open mind, by the end you will have a relationship with the characters that you won\u2019t want to end. While the series seemingly starts as somewhat cliche zombie book, it quickly evolves into a very deep and emotional rollercoaster ride of enjoyment."}, {"userName": "CJ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7106184-cj", "userReview": "Another to keep you wrapped up in the fact that you're following a character in a book but don't really give a damn......Where to next Mr Talbot?!?.

The craziness that is Talbot and his mad moments, family, friends and dog make for riveting reading. There is no shortage of zombie action, gore and heartbreak. The finale was particularly gross. Many loose ends still hanging in the wind, but MT also opens doors for new story lines, which is quite exciting.In this chapter of the story Talbot and his family have escaped the huge zombie horde only to find out they have been captured and imprisoned by the Demense group run by Dixon who clearly has a screw loose in that he once loved Deneaux and wants world domination!In the cell next to Talbot is Dennis, the poor chap who suffered at the hands of Deneaux in the last book. However with the ever present Tommy\u2019s help escape seems, and is, possible, they even find time to utilise some everyday things for some unique uses; the fireman\u2019s hose was both amusing and disgusting in equal measures!Meanwhile, Will and June in the lab\u2019 have been fascinated by Talbot's blood and are trying to make sense of it, June appears to have found the cure but also, finally, her conscience. Sometimes Karma comes at just the right time.BT and Justin are now healed but at what cost; just what else have these two nasty lab' rats been experimenting with and what on.I really enjoyed the other members of the group getting more of a chance to \u201cspeak\u201d and be their own entities, especially Tracy. It was interesting to see how they functioned without Talbot directing them. Also fascinating to have those characters expanded and not just have them as window dressing to Talbot; seeing why he fights so hard for them.Poor Porkchop, what a terrible history and current situation he finds himself in, there was some really horrific things in this part of the story that didn\u2019t include zombies or Deneaux.How certain people survived is beyond me and I can only hope that MT has some wonderfully spectacular deaths planned for them. There was also some great back story information on Tommy and Eliza that almost had me feeling sorry for her, almost.Zombie writers and their cat hatred, what is that? But, that is made up for with the clear love of Henry and all things dog/other animal.Trip was his normal hilarious self. The trees when he is looking for coconuts had me in fits of giggles at the mental image. Although that was soon superseded with Bobby Blaze his hotdog and blueberries!Zombies, fires, floods, warheads, Knights Templar and impending doom \u2013 of course Talbot survives! But what spooked me more was the comment Tommy makes near the end of the book about what is coming\u2026..I really enjoyed all the epilogues, but why oh, why do I now have to wait forEVER for the next instalment."}, {"userName": "CJ Long", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50161828-cj-long", "userReview": "Just like the others....Keeps you wanting to chase Talbot.....I'm addicted to this series.

Michael and Tommy, tried so hard to stop Mrs. Deanaux who was hell bent on destroying him and everything he cared for, simply because she viewed him as an enemy in her rise of power. After taking one of the top leaders of the Deanuax, a last stand for those who craved the power the apocalypses brought them, Michael took his escape as nothing as him and Tommy secured a remote to protect them from the machine guns planted every so often down the corridors. After barricading themselves in a lab with Deanaux, they fail to realize every single door unlocks after the power goes off, something they didn't realize when they had Captain Najarian shut the computers down, before killing him in cold blood. As his family was far away, he fought against what he believed to of been a yeti, but was actually a Gorilla turned zombie by one of Will's experiments (A scientist, whose \"Project\" killed June, a woman scientist who failed in stopping the Gorilla from escaping). AS the zombie's get smarter and smarter, one gets into Ron's house killing someone who wasn't disclosed in the novel. As the building begins to crumble from Jonathon's tanks as his elite group, around since the 1400s are in a final attempt to trap thousands of zombie's in the failing building. Trapped in the trees without Mike, Tracy feels her world shatter after they were rescued, simply to believe Mike died inside the maze of horrors. Distraught, nothing matters to her, as Michael, Tommy and Porkchop (Doc's adoptive son, but Doc died in a last ditch effort to save Porkchop after the zombie's first breached the compound) dress in firemen suits and escape the building, following Deanaux's escape as the first explosions begin to crumble it. On the way back to the safe-house, they come across Mike as they reunite, disbelief as they all believe he couldn't of survived it all. Now, as Tommy predicts more vampires coming after Eliza's death, a new threats looms dangerously over Mike's head."}, {"userName": "Gadget Girl", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23283946-gadget-girl", "userReview": "OK same as before zombieholics; if you've read any of the Zombie Fallout or Indian Hill series and loved it...STOP and go click Buy Now!

And I love how it leaves open the possibility of a new series. Mark Tufo's writing affects me in a way no other writer has been able to. I feel so entrenched in the Zombie Fallout series that I actually feel as if I am experiencing the adventure too. The characters have become such a part of me, I feel as if one of them could show up for dinner & it would feel like an every day occurrence. It is a very rare quality to find a writer who weaves their story in such a way that the reader becomes part of the story in their own mind. The best stories are the ones that make you lose touch with everything around you & instead teleport you right into the story. Page by page life was breathed into each of his characters as I traveled with them from the initial outbreak, as I raised my crosshairs to help thin the many different hordes of zombies trying to overtake us, when my heart broke over & over again each time another of our loved ones fell, and of course, the many times I wanted to beat Vivian within an inch of her life; let her heal then do it again.
