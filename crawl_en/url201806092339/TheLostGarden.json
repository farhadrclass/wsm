Gwen leaves her job at the horticulture center and takes the position of training young land girls at an estate on the Devon coast. There job is to grow food for the home front.In the estate house a group of soldiers are stationed, waiting to be posted. All have left things or people behind, many have acquaintances or loved ones who have already been killed, or presumed missing. For many of the girls this is the first time they have left home. Most are changed by the time they spend here. In restoring the gardens, Gwen finds a secret garden, a small abandoned place whose name is on a rock. Who planted this, a garden that doesn't even show up on the plans of the estate?Beautiful, beautiful writing, poetic at times, begging to be read again and again. A simple story at the beginning that gains depth as we get to know some the characters. What the war has cost these people, the understanding that they can't go back to prewar lives, that things will never again be the same. A touching story that with a melancholy tone, so many flowers described of which I had never known.Virgins Woolf and her To the Lighthouse play an important part in this novel. The cover is simply stunning, in fact I found this to be a gorgeous package all around. Just love the way this author writes, so glad I have a few more of her books to read.

Helen Humphreys brings so much emotion and soul to her writing that you feel the angst of her characters, their loss, their sorrow, their hope. Gwen Davis flees war-torn London for an estate called Mosel in Devon. Mosel has been requisitioned to be used to grow food for the war effort, and Gwen, a horticulturist, and is put in charge of a group of volunteers for the Women\u2019s Land Army who are to work the gardens. Shortly before leaving London, Gwen\u2019s mother has died, and she is at loose ends and alone in the world. Along with the Land Army women, there is a troop of Canadian soldiers who are bivouacked at a house on the estate. The CO, Captain Raley, is another person caught in suspended time, and someone who will figure prominently in Gwen\u2019s experiences at Mosel. One of the other volunteers, Jane, is grappling with the reality of a missing finance. All are caught in the limbo that is created by war.When Gwen finds an abandoned garden, meticulously designed, carefully hidden and quite intentionally so, she awakens something new within herself. She adopts the garden as her own project and attempts to unravel the secret of how the garden came to be and who created it.I feel something that at first I\u2019m sure is fear. But no, that\u2019s not it. What I feel is a kind of unreality. I am a ghost. I have wandered back in time, or forward, and I have disturbed this sleeping place with my presence. The one thing I can clearly feel, the one thing I know above all else is that I am the first person to have been here in a very long time.Her attempts to connect with the lost someone who created the garden result in a myriad of connections for Gwen, but most importantly one with herself, a she struggles to make sense of her life and the war that has shattered her world.The thing with war is this, we cannot change ourselves enough to fit the shape of it.There were so many profound passages in this book that I kept stopping to write them down so that I would never lose them. There is a conversation between two of the characters about poetry that was stunning. And this comment about writing:When a writer writes, it\u2019s as if she holds the sides of her chest apart, exposes her beating heart. And even though everything wants to heal, to close over and protect the heart, the writer must keep it bare, exposed. And in doing this, all of life is kept back, all the petty demands of the day-to-day. The heart is a river. The act of writing is the moving water that holds the banks apart, keeps the muscle of words flexing so that the reader can be carried along by this movement. To be given space and the chance to leave one\u2019s earthly world. Is there any greater freedom than this?Gwen finds a secret garden, long abandoned; learns what it is to love, what it is to have a friend, and what it means to be a part of life instead of a spectator. In sharing her story, we find a secret garden as well, a garden of words and thoughts that flower, bloom and germinate in our minds and settle into our hearts. The book is a gift."}, {"userName": "Jennifer (aka EM)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1393336-jennifer-aka-em", "userReview": "The only reason I'm not giving this a full five stars is because I thought the underlying metaphor was a little strained and heavy-handed at times; just a few times. But the language - oh, the language. Humphreys is a poet and it shows. And the longing, and the love, and the grief.Originally, Humphreys wanted the novel to be a tribute to reading, not gardening - and it manages to be both. Set in rural England in 1941, The Lost Garden revolves around a 30-something lonely heart who loves, in no particular order: Virginia Woolf's To The Lighthouse; her mother, who does not love her back; a Canadian soldier stationed in a transition house up the road, who cannot love her back; a younger, very sad woman named Jane who has been assigned to work with her in the \"Woman's Land Army\" and who shows her what love looks like; and the definitive guide to roses, a massive tome called The Genus Rosa, which she uses as a sexual surrogate (it does not love her back). She relates better to parsnips than people, but ultimately, she learns how to love and it - as much as the gardens into which she pours all her own nurturing, regenerative love - saves her from the death that surrounds her.This book is steeped in death. The amount of death and decay is positively astonishing. And that means it's sad - yes. But also, it's not sad at all. It is full of hope and growth (personal and floral). We are left with this sort of triumphant and whole sense of love and life, which will bloom again amidst death. It's a little miracle, this book, like the flowers and gardens and books and characters within it.PS - the official description of this book does it a great injustice. I don't know that this mini-review rectifies it at all, but don't let either from discouraging you from reading this little gem."}, {"userName": "endofmarch", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2486548-endofmarch", "userReview": "I love stories about gardens, that involve gardens, or where the setting is in a garden. So I could not resist picking up this book and having a look at it. The story sounded interesting and intriguing as well. And oh, how I wasn't dissapointed. I got so much more than what I was expecting.It's England, 1941, and London is being destroyed by the Blitz. Gwen Davis, our narrator and protagonist, is a 35 year old horticulturist. Solitary and better with plants than she is with people, Gwen nevertheless volunteers to move to an estate in the Devon countryside to lead a team of young women in growing crops for the war effort. There she finds herself overwhelmed at first by her inadequacy and lack of leadership. With time, her relationship with Jane, a young women waiting for her fiance missing in action, who loves too much and passionately and is a bit too wild, and with Raley, a Canadian soldier posted with the rest of his regiment in the house nearby, waiting to be deployed, will change her forever. She also finds a lost garden, hidden on the estate and take it upon herself to restore it and discover the love story it seems to tell, a story which, in a way, will become her own.I loved Gwen from the start. Shy, solitaty, unsure of herself except when it comes to her knowledge of plants, she writes letter to Virginia Woolf in her head, and puts the volumes of The Genus Rosa (an encyclopedia of all the roses known to man) on her body when she lies in bed to calm herself. She grows and learns about love and loss and coming to terms with ones past and fear of intimacy. This novel is mostly about loss and love which are almost the same thing when you live in times of war. It deals with the fear of the soldiers about to leave, the fear of the ones left behing, the loss of home and family, and the things we cling to in an effort to make sense of things that just don't. But mostly, though, it was so brillantly and beautifully written. I love Helen Humphreys' prose, poetic and fluid, with moments of such intense beauty and truth at times. Sure sometimes it might have been a bit cheesy, but I never minded. It swept me up from the first page, and even though it lulled a bit in the middle, I still didn't want to stop reading. It wasn't a long novel at all, not even 200 pages, but it felt utterly complete, and still open to so much more. I borrowed this book from the library, but I think I'll buy it for myself so I can reread it as much as I want."}, {"userName": "Jess", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28497722-jess", "userReview": "My first Humphreys' book and it won't be my last. This was a hauntingly written novel in a quiet and profound manner that made me stop in my tracks several times while reading to absorb the words in my head. Set outside of London in 1941, the descriptions of the war's destruction and death are horrific but even more compelling are the stories of the individuals living it. Humphreys' gives voice to a regiment of Canadian soldiers billeted at an English manor awaiting deployment into the bleak fray of war and a group of \"Land Girls\" charged with cultivating the gardens for needed food crops. The story in the forefront is that of master gardener, Gwen Davis, who is tasked with leading the group of girls in the gardens' conversion from flora to that of potatoes. Gwen brings demons of her own from London with her to the countryside and spends much of the book pondering (sometimes in a wistful manner) the nature of love, loss, and loneliness. She finds a secret garden devoted to these emotions and there spends her time in contemplation and searching. The interactions of the soldiers and girls are poignant, sad, and hopeful with the backdrop of the war theater playing out behind them.

I realized halfway through, that I can think of at least 3 people locally who would love this book, though I might be reluctant to let it leave. It's not a dramatic story, but love, loss and longing are such integral characters in this novel. Part mystery, part tribute to Virginia Woolf (indeed, how often have you written a letter to someone in your head?), part gardener's paradise and delight, little quips such as \"I much prefer parsnips to people. They are infinitely more reliable. The stupidity of vegetables is preferable to the unpredictability of people.\"--this little tale has much to recommend it. I typically scatter little markers in a book to help remind me what I want to remember for a review...this book has no fewer than 8. I won't bore you with the bits that struck my fancy-- just know that you will have moments of delight at the turn of a phrase or the image the author builds. This is what I know about love, That it is tested every day, and what is not renewed is lost. One chooses either to care more or to care less. Once the choice is to care less, then there is no stopping the momentum of goodbye. Each loved thing slips away. There is no stopping it. And yes, magnolias do look like sad candles...one more quote and then I'll shut up:The author is at one end of the experience of writing and the reader is at the other, and the book is the contract between you.This book fulfilled the contract."}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16639247-lori", "userReview": "What an achingly beautiful little book!

The perfect read for spring - a book to get lost in while watching the world renew itself. Yes, there is an undercurrent of sadness throughout this book but I did not find myself feeling gloomy as I closed the cover. Instead, I felt quite optimistic. The lost garden had been found and restored. And each spring, the garden will remember - and return.

Gwen, the central character, is supposed to be leading a land girl platoon in WWII, but spends her whole time mooning away, re-creating a secret garden where apparently nobody notices she isn't doing a stroke of useful farm work. There is a small contingent of Canadian soldiers camped in the farm's main building; the girls have loads of fun organizing dances for the men, but do not quite have torrid affairs, in fact it's all quite chaste and platonic, bar a little heavy breathing in the secret garden. Yes, the author has a perfect ear for poetic phrases but sometimes they're as out of place as jewels in a plumbing supply store. Conversations lurch from the sublime to mundane, as if the author had never actually had one herself ... or is that a clever way of illustrating how Gwen is a troubled lonely hermit of a woman, and quite lacking in self-confidence?I don't know, but for me the novel hit bottom with this vignette: one of the girls, Jane, is reading Virginia Woolfe to David, a soldier who has retired from the noise and commotion in the soldier's quarters to quietly knit a sweater for his fiancee back home. (Implausible? yes, but not impossible). Then the wool runs out, and Jane pulls off her own sweater, telling David to unravel it so he can finish, thus revealing her slight and anorexic frame, for Jane is mourning her own airman missing in action over France, and is literally starving herself to death (and yes, I do mean \"literally\").Oh please.

I read a lot of books set in WWII, but the trials of war were almost secondary in this story, though it is definitely the backdrop. This story was more about finding oneself after losing oneself; about love, longing, secrets, passions, hope, and mindfulness in the face of tragic circumstances. Gwen pours all of her emotions into gardening. She's like a profiler - but of flowers. She creates profiles for each genus. She can get to the heart of the matter through horticulture. It's how she relates to the world, to the war, to the Land Girls, to Raley.Several times Humphreys' writing hit me so profoundly I had to stop reading and just sit here and absorb it. For non-spoiler examples, \"What is longing if not the ghost of memory?\" \"There is a vocabulary to existing, to taking up living space in the world, that cannot be translated over the chasm of death.\" And \"The book is the shared experience, the shared intimacy.\" Book lovers love meeting authors, but really, reading their work, the words that she ripped from herself and poured onto the page - that is as close as you can get.

At first it may seem a bit disjointed and difficult-going. But looking deeper, the reader finds that like, the lost garden of the title, the story is multi-layered and the best layers are hidden beneath the weeds and neglect. Gardener Gwen Davis comes to the Devon countryside to lead a group from the Women's Land Army. These women have volunteered to grow vegetables for the war effort. Gwen is shy and has little self-confidence and finds it difficult to exert the authority necessary to get the women to work. With the help of Jane, a born leader, she gets the work sorted out and the war effort is undertaken. More important for Gwen, she discovers a hidden garden. Her story unfolds as she brings the true nature of the garden to light. There are three portions to the garden: Longing, Loss and Faith. Each section planted with flowers that represent the nature that particular section. In the end, Gwen discovers that the entire garden was a garden of love. Her discovery mirrors the discoveries she makes about herself along the way. She discovers her own value, the value of love, and what it means to be home.Like good poetry, I sometimes find it hard to really write about good writing without giving it all away. Here is a quote that I particularly like...I think it sums up Gwen's thoughts on Loss as it relates to love:This is what I know about love. That it is tested every day, and what is not renewed is lost. One chooses either to care more or to care less. Once the choice is to care less, then there is no stopping the momentum of good-bye.Four stars out of five. Read primarily for the Take A Chance Challenge--this was a Library Staff Pick book.

Also on the estate, waiting to be posted, is a regiment of Canadian soldiers. For three months, the young women and men will form attachments, living in a temporary rural escape. No one will be more changed by the stay than Gwen. She will inspire the girls to restore the estate gardens, fall in love with a soldier, find her first deep friendship, and bring a lost garden, created for a great love, back to life. While doing so, she will finally come to know herself and a life worth living."}, {"userName": "Robyn", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4941672-robyn", "userReview": "\"Love is tested everyday, & what is not renewed is lost.

I loved the author's love for them. The characters were a mix of thin and compelling. Jane got some great lines, and Gwen grew on me. Her realization that she has been too defensive in her dealings with the other women working at the garden was resonant. Captain Raley never seemed well rounded enough to justify her fascination with him."}, {"userName": "Marlis", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1168801-marlis", "userReview": "I'm not sure how I felt about this book. The writing was certainly lovely but the story was just so sad, so hopeless. It's not how I like to feel when I finish a book.

The only reason I finished was because the book is only 182 pages and I kept trying to give it a chance.

Unwilling to watch her beloved city crumble under the assault of incendiary German bombs, she accepts a position at a requisitioned estate in Devon, supervising the farming of potatoes for the war effort. A 35-year old spinster with a wicked wit and a fondness for literature, Gwen arrives at her new post to find that the group of \"Land Girls\" she's to supervise have little interest in planting. They're far more eager to cultivate the human crop -- a regiment of Canadian soldiers stationed at the estate, awaiting their assignment. Allying herself with the Canadians' commanding officer, Gwen strategically wins the girls' cooperation by agreeing to a series of evening dances at which they may mix with the soldiers. Pleased to again be in control of her environment, Gwen makes two life-changing discoveries. The first is the existence of feelings she's never before allowed herself to experience. The second is a hidden, abandoned garden on the estate, the secrets of which Gwen is compelled to unlock. With poignant, poetic mastery of her craft, Helen Humphreys has produced a smart, no-nonsense, and utterly sympathetic character in Gwen Davis. And as her affecting story unfolds and she plumbs the mysteries of gardening, readers too will explore the depths of the soil in which grow the tender shoots of love.", "title": "The Lost Garden", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1302575.The_Lost_Garden", "average": 3.77, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348267134l/1302575.jpg", "reviews": 294, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/88591.Helen_Humphreys", "name": "Helen Humphreys"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fiction", "Cultural", "War", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1302575.The_Lost_Garden", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18458907-il-giardino-perduto", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2025604.The_Lost_Garden", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2025600.Coventry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20256751-the-evening-chorus", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/153185.Afterimage", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2025598.The_Frozen_Thames", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/467590.Wild_Dogs", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
