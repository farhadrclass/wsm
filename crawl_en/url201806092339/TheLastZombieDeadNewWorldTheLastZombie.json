Brian Keene's got us living two years after the zombie outbreak, where zombies have come back from, and returned once again to, the dead. The government is somewhat intact and has been living underground until one of the main bases suddenly goes silent. Our group decides to send a team of scientists and soldiers up to ground level to check it out and gather intel in the meantime. One of the scientists, Ian Scott, is still trying to devise a long term vaccine for the zombie virus when he volunteers to be part of the search and rescue team. And before long, he becomes THE LAST ZOMBIE ... dun dun duuuuuuun."}, {"userName": "Dan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6305538-dan", "userReview": "Not really a Zombie story per say but a Post Apocalypse after the zombies book. Th art was okay and so was the story not too sure if I want to read the other 2 volumes."}, {"userName": "Jessica Bronder", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5781282-jessica-bronder", "userReview": "We start with Day 27 of the zombie attack and Dr. Scott being transported to the Colorado FEMA bunker. Zombies are everywhere, his fianc\u00e9 is in the West Virginia FEMA bunker, he should be getting married today, and he is the one with a possible cure to the zombie virus.Fast-forward two years. Zombies have disappeared but other illnesses, like bubonic plague, leprosy, and others, are out there from the decomposing corpses. Also, the West Virginia Bunker has gone offline. A helicopter was sent to check on them and it crashed. Unable to find out what is going on, the Colorado base plans on sending in a two-vehicle team to find out how the county is fairing and to find out what is going on in West Virginia.The convoy starts off and gets to a local town where they find a mother and daughter scavenging. They also stumble upon some zombies and raiders. This is going to be harder than they first though.I really liked this graphic novel. I love Brian Keene and zombies so it just goes to say that I had to get it. I got sucked in and was so disappointed that it was so short. I really liked how they portrayed the raiders, a very realistic situation.Zombie lovers, you will want to get this graphic novel."}, {"userName": "Kaisersoze", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22517400-kaisersoze", "userReview": "A fascinating opening chapter to a unique spin on the world of the undead, it's no surprise such an engaging read should come from the mind of Brian Keene - he who has authored a bevy of fantastic tales dealing with the shambling undead. Dead New World sets things up in a quick and straight forward fashion, without any fat to be trimmed. A number of characters immediately make an impression and Keene wastes no time in dumping his group of protagonists into the middle of some serious action. By the end of this edition, I was left eager for more, and hope the quality continues through the rest of this promising tale.4.5 stars, with only some difficult to discern characters amongst the artwork lowering the score from 5."}, {"userName": "Jonathan Echevarria", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31868064-jonathan-echevarria", "userReview": "Even though I am addicted to the genre, I admit that we are absolutely flooded with zombie titles. There is both good and bad with this happening to us long term zombie fans.On the one hand there is a lot to choose from. On the other hand it is becoming harder to see a story we haven't seen before. Brian Keene attempts to give us something new by offering us a story about what happens after all the zombies are gone. The result is a mixed bag of sorts. As a zombie fan I enjoyed it, but as a comic book fan I wish they got another artist on this. It really doesn't fit the story that is trying to be told here. I give it 4.5 zombies for originality and creativity in a market where the undead are just about everywhere."}, {"userName": "47Time", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33626218-47time", "userReview": "[On the way the soldiers stumble on a child and its mother looking for supplies. They hear a large group of zombies closeby and are forced to open fire. The zombies turn out to be people infected with leprosy instead. They help the soldiers to find Ian who got separated from the group and landed head-first into a mass grave, losing his consciousness. It turns out he has the zombie virus which was thought inactive in the last two years. He decides to take the only medicine available, a drug he worked on that can't heal, only delay the infection.Meanwhile a group of scouts are tracking the soldiers. They intend to report to their main group of marauders which are numerous and well organized. The marauders attack during the night and there are casualties on both sides until the lepers destroy the marauders and their vehicles. The soldiers are changed from this experience, but they must carry out their mission.

It takes place post-zombieworld - and the design of the comic is sound. It has a chalky look and the charcoal shades are effective. The story is actually interesting which is surprising given the convoluted genre. Looking forward to the net addition."}, {"userName": "Dave", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/805867-dave", "userReview": "For fans of the now inescapable series The Walking Dead, Brian Keene's \"The Last Zombie\" is s definite recommendation just based on my short time with this first trade. The Last Zombie shares many things with The Walking Dead, it just chooses to go down a different road. While the latter is basically a soap opera/drama placed within a zombie apocalypse, the former pulls the camera back and instead focuses on the last remnants of the US government years after a zombie outbreak destroys civilization as we know it. Both have great character development, both show some brilliant action, both are in black and white and sport some really great writing and dialog. We find out that there are four FEMA bunkers across the United States where the last surviving pieces of the government are hiding out, along with the military and of course, the scientists that are still struggling to research a cure. We follow a Dr. Ian Scott who is one of the head researchers in the Colorado bunker - there are also bunkers in Washington state, Maine, and one in West Virginia where Scott's fiancee is. 2 years after the outbreak, suddenly the West Virginia bunker goes offline, ceases all contact with the other 3 facilities. Maine sends out a helicopter which they also lose contact with. What's going on? This story already has me by the BALLS and all I want is more. The Colorado bunker decides to send out a team of two APC's - armored personnel carriers - filled with 4 soldiers and 2 researchers in each, heavily armored and able to run on gasoline, solar power and batteries. They are also amphibious and have the ability to be sealed off from radioactive, biological or chemical hazards. This search and rescue team has two missions: one, to drive across the country and discover why the West Virginia facility has gone offline, and two, to research exactly what's going on throughout the country and if the outbreak has ceased. Scott of course has his own reasons for volunteering. Shortly after the team leaves the facility they find out that it's a good thing they are heavily armed, and that they shouldn't underestimate one minute of this new world they are now traveling in and re-discovering.If they made The Last Zombie into a television show a la AMC's take on Kirkman's Walking Dead, it's scope would be huge. If done right, dare I say it might even be better. Again, this is based on my thoughts towards the first book alone. But I loved every single second of it and I finished it too fast. I can't wait to read more and I hope it continues to throw me for a loop, avoid the \"zombie world\" cliche's and entertain the shit out of me. I am quite literally going onto Amazon to buy the next books right after I click \"save\" on this review. If that's not a strong way to end any review, I don't know what is."}, {"userName": "Christopher", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9914138-christopher", "userReview": "the story is pretty cool in this book. i really like the fact that it takes place at the end of the zombie outbreak and that the author recognizes the fact that zombies cant last forever and will eventually rot away into nothing.it's a fresh take on the genre. this volume does a good job of setting up the story and the characters and i can only imagine the next two volumes will really get rolling as far as story progression goes. now for the art,which is lacking. first off it's black and white which is not my fave and the pictures are very dark at times, even more so when the story is set at night. second,alot of the soldiers look very similar and i had a hard time telling who was who aside from planters because he has goggles on his helmet and the sergeant because he is black when most of the others are white. i dont really like the fact that i have to come up with little tricks of telling people apart in a graphic novel.on the whole i found this book enjoyable. even though the art could be better it's not garbage and i found the story made up for it in alot of ways. most zombie books you read take place at the beginning or the middle stages of the pandemic it's refreshing to read one that deals with the end stages of it. i feel invested in the character dr scot and i can't wait to see what happens next. I look forward to reading the next two volumes."}, {"userName": "Dustin Reade", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4905607-dustin-reade", "userReview": "great artwork, but the story seemed too familiar in places. Keene does zombies like nobodies business, but something about this was just...I dunno...lacking, I guess.
