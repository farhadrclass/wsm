Sammy Greene who is hosting a talk radio show finds that there is no end to the wild events that Y2K will bring. Sammy\u2019s father, Jeffrey Greene, is a real estate tycoon in the city but Sammy is hesitant to make contact with him. Sammy was close to her previous step-mother but since her father got a divorce and is now remarried Sammy hasn\u2019t bothered to get in touch with Jeffrey since she moved to California. Sammy has always felt that her dad was more interested in his own life and concerns than that of his daughter.When Sammy gets a call about the discovery of a burned body, she decides to check into the story and discovers that the body has been identified as Ana Pappajohn, the daughter of Sammy\u2019s old friend Gus Pappajohn. Sammy notifies Gus Pappajohn who immediately flies to California to claim his daughter\u2019s body.The story switches back and forth between Sammy\u2019s actions and that of Ana Pappajohn who actually was still alive. Ana is working for an expensive escort service and is separated at a party from her friend and roommate Sylvie. Somehow the two had gotten their purses mixed up and Ana wound up with Sylvie\u2019s purse. When Sylvie\u2019s body is discovered it is thought that the body was that of Ana\u2019s since Sylvie carried Ana\u2019s ID.Ana\u2019s date was Neil Prescott, a U. S. Congressman, who was working with Sammy\u2019s father and had some deals going to insure his reelection. The people Prescott was working with were ruthless individuals that would go to any lengths to promote their own interests. Ana soon discovered that Sylvie was passing information regarding the activities of the escort service\u2019s clients. Ana stumbled on some documentation that Sylvie had hidden and the fact that she might have the documentation put Ana\u2019s life in danger.This novel has several story lines going at the same time. Sammy and her friend Gus begin to believe that Ana is still alive and in hiding and that many details of the burned victim\u2019s death have been manipulated to avoid anyone discovering the true identity of the victim. Sammy takes many chances to discover to locate her friend Gus\u2019 daughter. It seems that at every turn there is intrigue and cover-up. The authors bring the multiple story lines together in a satisfying and surprising way."}, {"userName": "Kathy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4353493-kathy", "userReview": "I have not read the first novel in this series by Deborah Shlian and Linda Reid, Dead Air. Devil Wind can easily be a stand alone novel. This book features Sammy Greene who is a radio talk show host working the midnight shift in Los Angeles. It is the turn of the millennium, December 1999. The Santa Ana \"devil\" winds are blowing and fanning fires in the hills above Los Angeles. There is political corruption and murder in this fast paced story. Sammy's long lost father also makes an appearance as a wealthy real estate developer. A good thriller but I found it almost too fast paced at times as there were many intersecting story lines."}, {"userName": "Ben Matchar", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5402866-ben-matchar", "userReview": "The second in the Sammy Greene Thrillogy! This book is filled with suspense, smart plot turns and the some dangerously real scenarios that will scare and intrigue. Its star is a brash, red-headed, Yiddish-speaking radio host who will not stop until getting to the bottom of it all. The fear brought on by the approach of Y2K and the Santa Ana winds that are spreading wildfires in Southern California are the backdrop to this intelligent mystery."}, {"userName": "Mindi Rosser", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4803363-mindi-rosser", "userReview": "My reading time is limited, and I only risk reading a novel I expect to enjoy from a reader\u2019s perspective. Therefore, I chose to review Devil\u2019s Wind, which is a book written by two female thriller authors.Disclaimer: The following thoughts are only my personal opinion and should not be construed as judgment upon the authors or their other works of fiction. Personal taste for a book should always be considered.---------I admit that I gave up on the book at the 18% mark. I could not force myself to finish something which elicited negative feelings from my reader self. Still, I wanted to point out what I gleaned, as a writer, from the book. Here are my thoughts:Why am I switching into the POVs of almost all the minor characters?I\u2019m so tired of head-hopping. I\u2019m going to scream and hurl the book against the wall...wait, it\u2019s my Kindle.Who IS the main character? Who am I supposed to care about?I am unsure whom I should be following through the story until Chapter 4. Then, I got frustrated and read the synopsis of the story from the author\u2019s interview. Anna, my main character assumption, is not the main character. It is Sammy Greene. If Sammy Greene is supposed to be the main character, why am I viewing much of the story through other people\u2019s heads? I can barely get 2-3 Kindle pages without jumping into someone else\u2019s head.What is the major plot or storyline?This is a thriller, which usually entails subplots. As a reader, I cannot tell which plot or storyline is THE crux of the novel. I do not know what events are important.Some of the premises are interesting, if only they had been written to be clear and engaging. One of the positive points is that the authors succeed at elevating tension.Info Dumping Alert.This is Book Two of a series. The authors information dump the plot of Book One into the first couple chapters with no attempt to \u201cshow not tell.\u201dShowing Off the Research.The authors described minute details of an entire heart attack scenario in the ER, which I thought unnecessary to the story. It felt like the authors were showing off inapplicable research. From a reader\u2019s perspective, I could care less.Make it Believable.The situations that allow for such predicaments to happen in the story feel contrived.For example, the two escort girls are wearing identical outfits, identical hair, and identical purses, they accidentally swap purses to cause an event to happen. Then, one of the girls is murdered by her \u201cdate,\u201d and he drops her body just NEAR a forest fire figuring that the fire should consume the body. Somehow, her swapped purse got into the car after she\u2019s dead AND he actually tosses it near her body in a humph. Really?Editing and Typos.Every chapter contains at least one typo or grammatical error. I was not trying to be knit-picky, but I was jolted outside the story with the mistakes.There are also a few too many adverbs, in my opinion.I garnered many \u201cwhat not-to-dos\u201d and even some \u201cto-dos\u201d from reading 18% of this book. If you do enjoy the story or have read it, leave your comment. I would appreciate any other perspectives. Zealotry for stellar thrillers is my passion.Here\u2019s the official synopsis and author interview for Devil Wind: http://www.thebigthrill.org/2011/04/d..."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1771794-jim", "userReview": "My biggest complaint is the book seems to \"hoover\" for a while; not much advancement in places. That annoyed me. The other minor complaints aren't worth mentioning. Note: I give books three stars unless I'm really impressed and give four. So my biggest complaint should be taken in that context.Yes, I figured out one bad guy early (using guy generically, male or female, since 'bad person' just has no punch), but not due to brilliance on my part, but just because that person was the \"too unlikely\" one (thus, by all that is sacred in mystery books, the obvious bad guy because that character was obviously not the bad guy). I should have known another bad guy before it was revealed, but I'd missed it. The rest just all feel in place.Oh, this book was a double whammy, in a sense. Two tightly related stories in one--unless you add the emotional context, then I think we're up to four story lines."}, {"userName": "Basil Sands", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1906284-basil-sands", "userReview": "All in all Devil Wind was a fairly good story. The pace seemed kind of slow for me as primarily an action thriller reader, but if someone were a mystery or romance reader primarily it may seem quite exciting indeed. As an IT professional both now and during Y2K I found the setting to be rather nostalgic.One note is that there is definitely a left leaning political perspective that is displayed throughout the book. If the reader is of that political ideology you'll be saying, \"Yeah! That's right Sammy!\". If on the other hand the reader is on the other end of the spectrum philosophically you might say, \"Huh? What kinda leftist Republican bashing is this?\" But if one reads it as a story and takes neither side it will turn out to be a decent tale.Pace: ModerateCharacters: Mostly well builtPlot: believableAction: spottyTension: moderate"}, {"userName": "Dan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5131595-dan", "userReview": "It is December 1999, and the Y2K phenomenon is upon us. California\u2019s Santa Ana winds create devastating fires throughout Los Angeles. The perfect time for a terrorist attack and to hide a murder. This is some of what is going on in Devil Wind. The main character is Sammy Greene, a late-night radio DJ, who gets caught up in the investigation.There is some action, but I wouldn\u2019t say it was a thriller. The characters did not do much for me and the plot was just okay. There is a mish-mash of things going on that at times I was lost."}, {"userName": "Pat", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8091521-pat", "userReview": "Loved this book.
