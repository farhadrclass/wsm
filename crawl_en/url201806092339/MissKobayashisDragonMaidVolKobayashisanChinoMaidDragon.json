It's a delightful slice of life series with a bit of a fantasy twist, and it's about a cute dragon-girl named Tohru, who, through a series of comedic events, came to live with and work as a maid for the titular Kobayashi-san \u2014 a single office-working lady programmer with a tough temper and the heart of gold. Tohru came to our world from a different, distinctly epic-fantasy dimension where she used to be a mighty and powerful dragon, but when she ends up living with Kobayashi she has to learn our earthly ways \u2014 funny shenanigans ensue. The manga and the anime are very similar, with most skits and stories adapted into the cartoon almost word for word, as is often the case with this genre.The series has a loveable cast of characters who mesh together really well, and a generally cheery attitude, although it also has a bit of a dramatic turn later on. The humour might be a dealbreaker for some people \u2014 it's a Japanese comedy series, so there are some body jokes here, and specifically a lot of attention to boobs (in this book, all dragons have huge breasts \u2014 D is for Dragon, to quote Tohru). Quetzalcoatl, one of the other dragon characters, is especially guilty of that, her body is the butt (no pun intended) of many jokes and draws a lot of attention. I personally didn't feel like this kind of humour was exploitative or degrading towards the characters since all the interaction regarding the body image happens between the female characters and isn't overtly sexual in its nature, so I was okay with that \u2014 but I can see it being off-putting to some people. Fortunately, boob jokes aren't the main or only appeal of the series \u2014 it really is all about the characters and their interactions. The heart of the book lies in the family-like relationship between all of these ridiculous people (and dragons!) who shouldn't ever be living side by side, but they choose to do so anyway because they love and care about each other.I just realised that I am basically reviewing the entire season of anime, and not all of what I say above may be apparent just from reading the first volume of manga \u2014 consider this my review of the first three or so volumes. The thing is, when choosing between the book and the cartoon, in this case I would actually recommend watching the anime first \u2014 the colours and gorgeous animation really suit this series well, and the impeccable Japanese voice cast helps to better sell characters like Kanna-chan, Kobayashi and Tohru herself (I don't watch anime dubbed, so no opinion on that part). The opening and ending songs are also absolutely glorious and earwormy so much so that I can't even think about this series without instantly hearing Ishukan Communication in my mind. But the anime is also over \u2014 just fourteen episodes and a bunch of short comedic specials is all you get (at least for now), and once you're done you'll probably want more. I know I did! And that's where the manga comes in handy, since it's the source material for anime and is still ongoing.So, Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid. Watch the anime! Then get the manga for more story and moe goodness. It's a delightful series either way, and is a great remedy for a foul mood together with other Japanese comedy classics like Nichijou, Azumanga Daioh and Lucky Star (all of which happen to be my favourites)."}, {"userName": "Daniel", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31814285-daniel", "userReview": "Moram da priznam mnogo sladje nego sto sam ocekivao.

This one was just so much fun!Kobayashi is a normal girl, can't hold her liquor (and it is just hilarious to see how she acts when she is totally drunk), is a closet otaku, but is also friendly and nice, and during one night she encounters something huge and decides to let the creature live at her place. That creature is Tooru and here the adventures start.Because Tooru is a dragon, and she is not from here, so everything is new, everything is different and it is so much fun to see her try to fit in, to try and not blow her cover, to try and please Kobayashi (because she really loves Kobayashi (not a spoiler you find that out in the first/second chapter)). I just had so many laughs because of the silliness that Tooru did, totally not understanding that doing such stuff is seen as not good, dirty or downright wrong. :)Tooru is a cute one though, I just loved how dedicated and sweet she was towards Kobayashi. Caring for her, and learning from her the ways of the new world she is in.About halfway we meet a new character, a friend of Kobayashi, and well you can just imagine how this ends up. Yep, in more silliness and more fun moments.There are also several other mythological beasts that make an appearance, and I was delighted to see them pass by. The art is pretty decent, at times the faces look a bit off, but other than that, the art is definitely good and with the way the characters are drawn, gives you a few laughs.All in all, I would recommend people to read this manga if you are looking for a funny manga with maids, dragons, drunk otaku, mythological beasts, oh and a hint of yuri.

This isn\u2019t as much about the romance between a dragon which shapeshifts into a human form and a dorky office-worker as it is a comedy centered around their relationship. It\u2019s so strange, it\u2019s barely queer, but there\u2019s no mistaking the affection between them as sexual and romantic.But then I read a snippet of conversation on the Okazu blog where this series was compared to I Dream of Genie, which was hella problematic between her being forced to be other than herself in order to fit in.I mean, the husband-wife dynamic (unnecessarily gendered, I know) that develops between the two main characters, especially with the addition of Kanna, a child, in the later chapters, is amusing, but I think I went into this with the wrong expectation. It just feels to fanservice-y, even though it\u2019s not nearly as bad as so many other manga out there\u2026 I am just really conflicted! Based on this one, I am going to read book to just see where this is going."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21887214-rachel", "userReview": "This was really cute!

Yet I ended up really liking this in spite of a few reservations.Normally I hate anime and manga with a focus on maids and maid outfits: it's a type of \"I live to serve you in any way, Master\" fetish fuel; sexist; outdated; degrading; fanservice. Nothing more. At least 'Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid Vol. 1' is more self-aware than most of its ilk. Also it's not so much about the maid's outfit (there are different kinds, as is pointed out here), as it is about the person within it (or underneath it... urgh!)The humour in 'Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid' works well for an \"ordinary human in modern world meets extraordinary fantasy circumstances\"-style slice-of-life, episodic comedy (something I'm not usually into). There are some ironic and witty parts. I like the bored, down-to-earth closeted Otaku Miss Kobayashi, who works at Hell Tours LTD, and likes to drink. A lot. I like her young shapeshifting dragon maid Tohru (how young is made too highly ambiguous) from another world, standing in complete contrast to her, and who's in love with her \"mistress\". Currently it's one-sided, as is typical in sitcoms, yet I'm relieved due to the age issue. The name Tohru, for a girl, reminds me of the main lead in 'Fruits Basket' as well, which automatically scores points from me. And I like the little fellow shapeshifter Kanna. Side characters are also funny and memorable in their own understated ways (even the obligatory big-breasted girl shapeshifter). There is more to them all than initial appearances suggest. The artwork is rather inconsistent, light and confusing. But occasionally the drawings - especially of Tohru in her dragon form, and in the rare panels where she's serious and intense - are magnificent. Raw emotions are there and cannot be mistaken.'Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid Vol. 1' - a kinda cute, kinda crass fantasy comedy with a wild premise and female focus. It definitely has funny and clever elements to it. Plus LBGTQ content (but seriously, how old is Tohru? Even for a dragon? Kobayashi is clearly an adult. Curse you Moe Lolita! I scourge everything you represent!). I haven't enjoyed a manga in a long time and this is a good pick-me-up, like tea, coffee, sugar. It did its job and caught my interest, as I'm sure this is how it snared other readers, and it won't let go. One of my guilty pleasures of the year.Final Score: 3.5/5"}, {"userName": "Teresa", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56683843-teresa", "userReview": "This cute manga is about a dragon named Tohru who is found stabbed by a special sword. When Miss Kobayashi finds her, she takes Tohru in as a maid to help her out, but she has to be in human form. Many neighbors and those Tohru comes in contact with on a regular basis think she is a hardcore cos-player. When another dragon enters the mix, Tohru finds that she is a bit jealous and does not want to share her master with anyone. On top of everything, Tohru is learning how things are different in the human world from her own, and she is just trying to get by!While this manga was cute and is generally for all ages, the reason why I gave it a lower rating than I would have liked is because of the plot. Rather than a larger overarching story, this is more like a bunch of mini stories put together. While cute, funny, and endearing, because there is no major plot going on, there is nothing to keep me going as a reader. It just does not have the same level of excitement that other Manga have. But...it was still good. The are is great and the humor is well places, making it an enjoyable read nonetheless."}, {"userName": "Kim Dyer", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30416437-kim-dyer", "userReview": "I discovered this yuri series at a recent convention and it's certainly a lot of fun. It's structure and tone made me think a little of Yotsuba&, only its clear that this story is meant for slightly older readers (don't be fooled by the tag on the back that says it's for all ages).The artwork is cute and the characters are lovable, especially Tohru. While there are a few panels of fanservice, there is actually far less than I was expecting from this volume. I loved Tohru and Kobayashi's awkward relationship and was left very curious to find out where the story is going, and how Tohru came to be so badly wounded in the first place.My only real issues were a couple of lacks of cohesion, which could be down to translation. There are some points where the narrative didn't really flow and where plot points aren't all that clear (I did not realise that Tohru had been hurt until quite late on in the story). But still, it's cute and I enjoyed it. I definitely would like to read more."}, {"userName": "Ellie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/79896564-ellie", "userReview": "I'm a huge fan of the Dragon Maid anime, so I was very excited to read the manga. I was not dissappointed! I really loved the artstyle, which was very uinque in comparison to other manga.

Her life is changed when she saves the life of a dragon one night. The dragon, energetic Tohru, changes into a maid in order to repay her debt to Kobayashi.
