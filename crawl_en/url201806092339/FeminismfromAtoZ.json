The last one I read was one which was very important to Norway \"ikke send meg til en kone-doktor\" which tells the struggles of Norwegian females and how abortion ended up being free here. And how badly it was before and even the deaths of females because of abortions done in what you would call an back alley. I highly recommend everyone to do check out feminist literature once in a while. This book reminds me a lot of Feminism p\u00e5g\u00e5r by Sassa Buregren and Elin Lindell. This one however does cover a broader specter but I found it somewhat lacking with regards to disability and feminism in that regard and I'd like for the book to look into that more. Another reviewer pointed out Gloria Stenem which I do have a huge problem with, and I do not at all consider her a real feminist based on her statements and sayings of trans people. I'd never ever be okay with it. Another good perk is that if you have a friend or relative that wants to get into feminism but you struggle with giving them a 101, this one could be used as that. It takes history into account which I do think is extremely important since the past does influence us today. I would however like more information about TERFs, SWERFs and white feminism in general. BUT I do think the book does a good job for an intro."}, {"userName": "Isaiah", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10624715-isaiah", "userReview": "I got an ARC in return for an honest review from NetGalley.I got this book because I can't help myself. I am unabashedly addicted to feminist writing and feminist theory. I devour it all. If I agree with it or not, I want to read it. I want to learn.This book had an interesting premise of educating younger feminists and giving them a framework to base their own feminism off of. The book does an amazing job of not being too far leaning in one direction or another of feminism. It is very middle road, with a few exceptions. There was even discussions on TERFs (which if you have read some of my other recent reviews you know how strongly I feel about that branch) and different branches of feminism that I had never heard an official term for, despite being an avid reader.I had three issues with this book:1. Who the heck likes French knots? That is just madness! The idea of doing your own needlework and realizing how being feminine is itself a form of feminism and feminist power is wonderful. I just hate French knots as they kick my butt and always have. For more information about feminist needlework tumblr is a great resource. My favorite blogger has her own site too. She has made waves and is amazing. I wish to one day have her skill.2. I was taught in undergrad by Dr. Luis Cordon about Freud and the unspoken history of Freud's work. Dr. Cordon said that Freud actually believed that the women and girls he was seeing were raped and being abused. However polite society men (the ones doing the raping) told him in no uncertain terms that if he continued with that view that they would believe he was a pervert because no self respecting man would ever do that to his own daughter and that perverts were not going to be tolerated. Freud in fear for his career changed his theory and made the bastardized version people are aware of today. This story is not told in the book, but I feel like it would have made the section about Freud even more powerful as it shows that men have dictated what has and has not happened to women, even if the men themselves were the cause of the trauma. That men who spoke out against the masculine order of things were often forced to change or they were kicked out. It would have been so cool to see that!3. Gloria Steinem. I am so against her being a feminist hero and the go to for people talking about what a good feminist is like. She active fights against trans people and belittles their lives. She has said amazingly problematic things in her speeches at college campuses (such as when she said that rich white women were the most oppressed at her talk on UCONN campus in the early 2010's). While this book stayed away from praising her as perfect as many other books and feminists do, I am just saddened to see her mentioned in any capacity by name when so many other feminists could have made the same points. bell hooks for example was not mentioned until the bibliography/further reading sections and is much more palatable for younger feminists.\u00a0The book covered so much and was such a wonderful starting place for so many future feminists. I am very thankful it exists. I am also thankful that I didn't have to cringe my way through it or have to defend my right to exist or the rights of my friends and family to exist. This book is wonderfully inclusive and even if someone doesn't go further in their reading, they will have a wonderful basis for feminist thought.To see more reviews check out https://mibookreviews.wordpress.com/"}, {"userName": "Faith Simon", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67334270-faith-simon", "userReview": "I received a copy of this title from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. I loved this book!!! I throughly enjoyed reading it, it felt exactly like an action-packed fictional novel, I was entirely enthralled all the way through and could barely put it down. This was filled with absolutely vital information, was very informative, educational, but also quirky and fun. I really enjoyed the end of every chapter with the \u201cTry this!\u201d section, I felt that it helped me connect to the material more and made me feel apart of a revolution, the activities really contributed to my understanding, retainment, and enjoyment of the book\u2019s contents. I also very much enjoyed the \u201cHERSTORY\u201d section of every chapter, a lot of research was clearly done for this book and I learned a lot of history and about a lot of women I\u2019d never even heard of, but whom have obviously greatly impacted the feminist movement and who should be greatly recognized far beyond a few books. I walked away from this book with greatly impactful knowledge and motivation, and I really appreciate that about it. Additionally, I also really liked that images of certain examples being used in the text were included, the content then feels a lot more real when compared to simple visualization. Everything that\u2019s mentioned actually happened!! This book is a brilliant educational tool and a call for action.

Oftentimes when I've read books that claim to be an introduction to feminism, they often end up being an introduction to what the author thinks about feminism. That's not to say those authors are wrong or make bad arguments, but in the past it's made me feel like I've ended up jumping into a conversation without enough contextual information to participate.Feminism from A to Z is a resource that makes you feel like you're being given the tools to start participating in a bigger conversation. These tools come in the form of discussion topics, history lessons, and do-it-yourself activities that equip you to keep thinking and talking about a topic. And it's fun!Other Thoughts:I really did appreciate the history aspect. I don't think I've run into a \"feminism primer\" in the past that has spent time giving clear, independent summaries of meaningful historical events like the Stonewall Riots or where the idea that gay people \"recruit\" comes from. I know that in the last year I read that there is a term called \"womyn\" and that it is problematic, but found the Google results that came up a little confusing. This book made history events clear and contextualized. I wish I had this sort of resource before I started college.I also loved the activities! At the end of every chapter, there are various activities to do. These can be anything from doing a journaling session, learning embroidery, hosting a discussion, or doing research. I was one of those kids who liked doing activities in books like these, so that hands-on approach felt very encouraging and familiar. There was a very well-rounded view of feminism, I thought. There was an intersectional presence throughout the book that addressed how race, sexual identity, gender identity, and class status affect privilege. I was really surprised to see that fatphobia made its way into the book! I do think that there could have been a more prominent discussion of how disability and feminism intersect, but ableism did come up a few times. Overall, this read was easy to engage with but worked hard to ensure that readers will be able to address difficult topics in future conversations. I had a great time reading it, and I might even try to go through this with my younger sister in a couple years when she becomes a teenager. With a resource like this, I would hope that her introduction to feminism will be a lot less confusing than mine was."}, {"userName": "Janet", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7306509-janet", "userReview": "I received a DIGITAL Advance Reader Copy of this book from #NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

As Eleanor Roosevelt stated (sic) \"No one can make you feel inferior without your consent\" - I was raised in a home where one's gender didn't have to be fought for or explained. This book ticked me off as it is common sense written in a misogynistic way: we shouldn't hate boys because \"they\" are not women and that \"they\" will impede your life and goals.So --- I am stating that my power (as a human, as a woman and not as a man) led me to the conclusion that if the young women and old women in my family followed the rules in the book, my nieces would be feminazis.

So most people embrace feminist values, but they're not willing to label themselves with the term. ... How can one, eight-letter word hold so much power? Maybe that's why so many people shy away from it\u2014because it has the power to create radical change.\n Pitman's book explains the basic tenants of feminist theory in the context of an informational ABC book geared towards young adults. Some of the terms used stood well on their own, such as R for Radical, while others, such as E for Easy Bake Oven, required a more detailed explanation on its application to feminist theory. Accompanying each letter was a beautiful, brightly colored illustration depicting some of the topics covered in the chapter. After giving a brief overview on how the term applied to feminist theory, each chapter had a section entitled 'Feminist Herstory', which provides stories about people throughout history (or folklore) contributed to the modern understanding of feminism. Each chapter closes with a 'Try This!' section which includes action-oriented exercises to help further develop an awareness of feminist concepts. I personally did not participate in any of the 'Try This!' exercises, but many of them looked fun and interesting, particularly making a feminist magazine and creating blackout poetry. I have a Master's degree in Psychology so many of the psychological and sociological terms discussed were a review for me. However, I was surprised by how much I learned about feminist theory in general. The point I found most interesting was that there are many different kinds of feminists. The type of feminist I am most familiar with (someone whose focus is on equal rights in the workplace, education, and in politics) is called a liberal feminist.Overall, I am giving this book 4 stars. Even though it is marketed for teenagers, this primer on the tenants of feminist theory will appeal to a wider audience looking for empowerment and equality."}, {"userName": "Kristina", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29044712-kristina", "userReview": "I LOVE this book! Absolutely loved reading it. This book is directed more towards teenagers/\"young adults\"; however, because that was the audience it was aimed at, it had such an ease of language and content, which makes it easy to read for all ages, and not just young adults (i.e., the explanations are not drenched in heavy vocabulary or syntax that is difficult to follow). It's not a stereotypical \"man-shaming\", \"anti-men\", book that is expected of by people who are not familiar with books about feminism, but comes from an educational place while promoting equality, and does so with facts (corresponding bibliography for the sources of those facts), as well as a great deal of historical examples from the past and present. I learned so much about organizations, affiliations, associations, events, and both men and women I had never heard of before, as well as psychological terms that made me think \"So that's what's called? I've experienced that before; now, I know there's a name for it!\" (Think: \"microaggressions\").
