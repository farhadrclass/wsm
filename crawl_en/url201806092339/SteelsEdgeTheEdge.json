So it was a little slower for me the third time through....but still totally amazing. Loved hanging out with the main couple, but more than that I totally adored seeing the kids George, Jack and Sophie need their own series some day. For now I'll just have to catch glimpses of them in the Innkeeper Series as grown-ups.Buddy Read/reread with all my fellow addicts at Ilona Andrews Addicts (IAA), I thought it was impossible but these girls make reading Ilona Andrews more amazing than it already is.Original Review:Steel\u2019s edge is just as fun as any of the other books in this series. It is full of action and family and I enjoyed every minute I spent in this world. Now I know that this is supposed to be the end of the edge series but it seems that even though the older couples have had their arcs completed it is entirely possible that in the future Ilona Andrews might try to do something else in this world that involves George, Jack and Sophie. I would definitely be interested in that series.That said this book is about Richard and Charlotte who are thrown together when Richard is mortally wounded and is brought to her for help. After a devastating incident Charlotte is determined to help Richard destroy the slavers, while the serious man is reluctant to accept her help he sees that they have many things in common and he could use a little help from an extremely beautiful woman he is attracted to. \n\"Congratulations,\u201d he said, his voice dry. \u201cYou finally managed to find a woman as tragically noble as yourself. I didn\u2019t think one existed.\u201d\nThe action is intense and there are a few heartbreaking moments along the way. I like Richard and Charlotte together they complement each other well and both have tragic pasts where they have been wronged by the ones they loved. Charlotte is a great heroine, being deadly and kind. She knows who she is and can put others in their place when they try to encroach on her, especially when the man isn\u2019t Richard.\n\"Having a fling with you doesn\u2019t appeal to me. You\u2019re handsome, but you\u2019re too inexperienced and too arrogant to be good in bed. Having ridden many horses doesn\u2019t make you a good rider; it just proves that you can\u2019t recognize a good one or don\u2019t know how to keep her. You\u2019re too young for me, and in ten years, when you improve, I will be too old for you. So let\u2019s not speak of this again.\u201d\nOne of the best parts of this book is that George and Jack get to tag along through much of it and Sophie gets a spot in all of the deceit and fun too. I love all of those kids and I really would read another book that included or was about them. Sophie is still so broken from her time with the slavers and has become probably more deadly than even Richard or Celise. Gods help the enemy that tries to go up against Sophie.\n\u201cThe death isn\u2019t important. The only thing that matters is the moment of decision. My path is a line. My opponent\u2019s path is another line. In the instant we meet, we\u2019re forever altered. We may both walk away, or my line or his line may end, but for a brief time we exist in the same space on the verge of action, and that space is full of possibilities. It\u2019s the moment in which I truly live. It\u2019s short. It\u2019s always so very short.\u201d\nThe other thing I loved about this book was the relationship between Charlotte and Richard. The resolution of the plot affected one of the MCs in a way that could have really tested the actual love felt between the characters. Without giving away what happened I wanted to say that it was handled so well. When you love someone, really love them, when a tragedy strikes you take care of one another no matter what. I thought it was wonderful the way it played out and I will say I totally teared up at the level of devotion felt between the two MCs This book did tie up very well most of the story lines in a complete manor. There is no wondering what happened to all of the enemies the hand, the slavers or the people in charge of them. I would also say that the story lines for many of the main players are totally wrapped up. The only ones that had great openings still are with George, Jack and Sophie so like I said before I hope that Ilona Andrews has some ideas for them down the road. I know that George is making an appearance in book 2 of the Clean Sweep series for sure.Another great and fun series from Ilona Andrews\u2026what will you guys think of next."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1720620-anne", "userReview": "3.5 starsSo. The Edge isn't my favorite Ilona series, but it's still good. And this (last?) installment wasn't my favorite of this series, but it was still pretty decent.Honestly, I wanted to read about the kids (Jack, George, & Lark) more than I did Charlotte & Richard.One of the amazing things about these authors is that they create such special & interesting characters. And not just the main ones, but the bad guys and secondary characters, too! Anyway, I'd love to see a series about those 3 nuts!And Derek and Julie. And Roman...*big pleading eyes*That's not asking for too much, is it?PLEASE?!Ok, ok, ok. Back to Steel's Edge. Charlotte is/was a Healer. THE Healer. <--she's badassBut her life sucked, b/c her ex-husband was a bastard who only wanted her for her ovaries, and when they found out should could never have children...he divorced her. In a fit of (I think, deserved) rage, she almost sucked the life out of the smarmy a-hole, and in an effort to control her magic and get a fresh start, she runs away to the Edge.Richard had a bad experience with his ex-wife, as well. Only she wanted to have money, not children. Poor guy.Unfortunately, instead of these two meeting at a church mixer, they're introduced to each other by a bunch of slavers from the Weird. See, Richard is hunting slavers for what they did to his niece, and (after some spoilery events) Charlotte is hunting for them because of what they did to someone she cared about in the Edge.Turns out, they make a pretty good team!And that's the gist of the story...ish.Bottom line: If you've been reading this series, you can't miss this one."}, {"userName": "Tadiana \u2729Night Owl\u263d", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8734459-tadiana-night-owl", "userReview": "Done with the EDGE quartet of books! Ilona Andrews really knows how to tell a story, and I liked the way each book in this series focuses on a different couple, though they're all interconnected. Charlotte and Richard, the main characters in this book, are in their thirties, both having survived the breakups of their first marriages. Charlotte is an extremely talented magical Healer, and Richard a fantastic swordsman and dedicated hunter of slavers, a terrible and brutal organization of degenerates who have been kidnapping people and selling them into slavery. Tragic circumstances bring Charlotte and Richard together, pitting them in a fight against the slavers. Richard especially is determined to bring down the entire slaver organization by dealing with the people at the very top. It's a daunting undertaking with a high likelihood of death, especially since Richard is #1 on the slavers' hit list (luckily they know him only as \"Hunter\"). Charlotte is able to use her powers to kill as well as heal, which is incredibly useful, but every time she does it it brings her closer to the dark side of her magic.As is always the case with Ilona Andrews, the hero is incredibly buff and hot and the heroine is both lovely and kickass, but if you're good with that and some sexytimes, her novels are really great adventures."}, {"userName": "Jo \u2605The Book Sloth\u2605", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13870608-jo-the-book-sloth", "userReview": "4 Sophie Stole The Show StarsReview to come tomorrow...Well, almost.

Be prepared for a double shot of it with Steel's Edge. Steel's Edge is book 4 in The Edge series by the wife and husband team known as the author, Ilona Andrews. I've liked The Edge series from the start. Still, being a huge Kate Daniels fan, The Edge series was always \"the other\" books by the author. Not any more, this book rivals any of Ilona Andrews other writings and may very well be my favorite.Why do I love this book?*The story is compelling. Richard is on the hunt to bring down an illegal slave trade. He has been working to develop connections, gather intelligence and dismantle the system. The system reaches to the highest levels in the aristocracy. He is aided in his quest by Charlotte, who as the Greatest Healer of her time, also has dark secrets. For every yin there is a yang. Charlotte has the power to heal but she can also employ that power to kill and bring plague. *The characters are mature. Both Richard and Charlotte are older than the characters from previous books. They are more experienced in life. Both have been married and experienced love before. They come to their union with more understanding and also more baggage. (And there intimate scene are very hot)Charlotte is a striking heroine with an indomitable spirit. In an exchange with an enemy who challenges her standing: \"Don't try to belittle me; you're hopeless outclassed. I see shortcomings in your every single aspect, from your lack of taste to your rotten morality. You've involved yourself in the basest of crimes. You facilitated murder, rape, and the torture of children. Your conduct is unbecoming a peer of realm.\"  Oh, snap! She is confident in who she is and is determined to a fault. And I love her spirit!Richard is my kind of hero: steadfast, honorable, skilled, caring and determined. I love the way he is in awe of her. When he experiences the power of her magic: \"...he stood in the epicenter of her silent storm, a feeling of otherworldly awe claimed him, as if he became part of a mystical event that could be explained, only experienced....He had encountered something greater than the limits of his ordinary life, and he was both alarmed and drawn to it.\" *You got a to love a book that gives a nod to one of the best movies of all time, Princess Bride - \"I do not thing that word means what you think it was means.\"IN A NUTSHELL: This is nearly a perfect book.

Ilona Andrews has made me fall so deeply in love with the characters of Jack and George that I feel positively robbed when I consider the idea that they will not get their own book. A travesty. But I'll get back to my boys in just a minute.The hero of the story is Richard Mar, Kaldar's brother, who we first met in Bayou Moon. He is on a mission to destroy the slave trade thriving in the Weird. The slavers nearly destroyed his niece, Sophie, and now he won't rest until he finds the head of the serpent and cuts it off.Charlotte is the Healer of her generation. Her gift helped her become magic nobility. But even her skills could not help her conceive a child --or keep a husband who married her for all the wrong reasons. His betrayal of their marriage drove Charlotte to use her gifts to harm... and as a result, she fled to the Edge to start a new life.The two cross paths when slavers chase Richard into the Edge nearly killing him. Charlotte saves his life, but his attackers follow him to her home and kill a dear friend of hers. That starts Charlotte on her own path of revenge against the slavers, and she is willing to use any means necessary to take them down. She and Richard join forces --and end up falling in love.First I'll tell you what I liked. The world building in this series is fantastic and unique. I love the idiosyncrasies of the Edge and the Weird. I love the complex social class system and the magic. I love how all the books and characters are connected, and while each book features a different love story, the bigger picture remains. Last but not least, I love the characters. Richard is a solid hero, with just a touch of that \"I'm not good enough for her\" vibe going on. Charlotte is refined, broken, and powerful all at once. She is almost impossible not to like. And --of course-- there are Jack, George, and Lark (Sophie.) Damn you, Ilona, for making me love them without ever giving me a look at their adult lives.This wasn't my favorite book in the series, however. The love story was too fast and the romance too easy. I think Richard and Charlotte were declaring their love in about two days. The real angst was in the external conflict. --My other issue was that it felt like the book was forced into an end-of-series role. It tacked on the Spider and the Hand elements almost as an afterthought... which is a shame considering they were worth their own big story arc. Overall I did enjoy it. Definitely worth reading for any Edge fan.Rating: BUPDATE: Ilona says she may indeed give us Jack, George, and Lark's story --but in a different format than the current Edge books. A trilogy, perhaps.

From the start, all \"The Edge\" books are a fascinating mix of paranormal romance, fantasy, mystery, action, adventure, knighthood. Fourth book has the strongest impression on me, as the collision of good and bad is much more noticable and crushing. The fighting scenes encircled me with action, thrill and adrenaline.In some point, this book feels like two individual stories, which unite to make a fascinating book. I really liked the nicely written, engaging heroines and heroes in this series. In the first part, the authors presented the key stories from Charlotte and Richard life. They both are unique characters with fascinating abilities. In the second part, the book transfers the daredevil adventure, that I read in other books of this series, to a high level in espionage, spying, exclusive deception and tricks. Not forgetting the romance line and a hilarious role both George and Jack play in the world of danger. I hope some day there will be the fifth book about the boys. George and Jack stole my heart from the beginning. Love ya guys <3 The touching story about Sophie/Lark gripped my heart too. I admired her development and change. Though, to sum up all the four books, I found one thing, that annoyed me a little bit in some way. The series has one pattern: rough- tough heroine is in trouble and needs help. She attracts disasters and of course she meets a hot man who is capable to help her. At first they deny their affection, while fighting the evil and after some time they get their \"happy ever after\" (which was really too sweet in the first book). But it doesn't spoil the series, I even found comfort there in the end.

I enjoyed this book, don't get me wrong, but it really didn't feel like a conclusion. I understand that Lark/Sophie, Gaston, George, and Jack are in Sweep in Peace as adults, but so much is left unsaid. And if I'm being really honest, I feel like this series never surpassed the peak of the first book, On the Edge. This is a very fun series, and each book is in its own way good, but if I knew the final installment was going to end like this I probably would have passed on reading the rest. I do also want to note that in Clean Sweep, Klaus Demille is the brother of the main character, Dina Demille, and he has yet to make an appearance. Hopefully, when Dina is able to finally locate him in her series, we will have a little more context since he is the one that recruits George in this series. This final installment was surrounding a healer, named Charlotte, who escapes her privileged life to find herself in the Edge after an unfortunate turn of events. The male protagonist is Richard Mar, better known as Kaldar's (from Fate's Edge) brother, who has put quite a mark on his back for some very bad people who refer to him as The Hunter. They find themselves tangled up in an extremely sticky web and decide to try to take down a very organized sex trade together. Charlotte and Richard were alright, but it seemed like, again, the kids stole the show, especially Sophie/Lark. I would love, love, love a book just about her and what has happened to her since in Clean Sweep, especially with \"help\" from Charlotte's adoptive mother. Also, I always sort of felt like it was going to be Sophie/Lark with Jack, but this book kind of shifted (*ba dum tss*) the romance to George. Either way, she was phenomenal in this book and I don't believe for a second her vendetta is truly over.I'm not sure if IA plans on coming back and wrapping this up a little better, but I certainly hope they do. This world just feels so incomplete now, and I think a fifth book would definitely fill in the missing pieces.

He is Kaldar's brother whose wife had left him years before because she hated living in the Mire. He is also the one who saved Lark/Sophie from the slavers and has devoted his life to bringing down the slaving industry. He has killed so many of them that he has been dubbed \"The Hunter\" and is hated and feared by the slavers. We also have Charlotte, a blueblood royal healer, whose husband left her because she is barren and his family name is more important to him than her. She leaves the Weird to get away from her old life and ends up renting Rose's old house in the Edge. She works as a healer for the local Edgers and has been \"adopted\" by Rose's grandmother.Richard is almost killed by the slavers and is brought to Charlotte to be healed.

It's an appliance from the Broken. you put vegetables into it, push a button, and it chops them into tiny pieces.\"Richard frowned. \"Wouldn't it be easier to chop them with a knife?\"\"It's meant to save time,\" she explained.\"Does it?\"\"Well, cleaning it usually eats up most of the time you save on chopping.\"\"So, you're telling me I'm useless.\"\"It's a neat gadget!\"\"And I'm hard to clean, apparently.\"\n\nthis is easier than cleaning the kitchen after the hubby decides to use the Cuisinart...So, they are both lethal killers - a match made in heaven!We also get George, Jack, and Sophie in this book, and it is fun to see how they are growing up.

When I first discovered that this final book featured a healer as the main heroine, I had some qualms as to whether Charlotte would be able to achieve the level of badass-ery that I've come to expect from Ilona Andrews. Case in point, FATE'S EDGE's Audrey Callahan wasn't a fighter either, and ended up being my least favourite THE EDGE female protagonist. All of my doubts quickly flew the coop though when I learned that de Ney's abilities could also be used to harm, and I'm not talking little ouchies here, but mass murdering plagues. Never have I been so happy to eat my words! The world-building, narration, secondary characters, and storytelling absolutely rocked too. This was the series finale after all, and this author duo doesn't do half-assed. Period.I liked that the protagonists were older; they've both been married once already, are individuals first, and a couple second. Charlotte and Richard have been around the block a couple of times, and as a result, were unwilling to settle for anything less than true love. It made them both more accepting of their respective faults; the flash fire romance was believable on account of them knowing exactly what they wanted in a partner, and not being afraid to go after it. I loved de Ney's flawless poise vs. Mar's backwoods mannerisms, and her raw power to his skill with a blade. She fears transforming into a bringer of plagues, while as he's worried that he's not Blue Blood enough for her. When they finally opened up their hearts to a relationship, it was like two puzzle pieces sliding home.The Andrews' skillfully wrapped-up this series' story arc while still weaving a captivating story about slavers, political intrigue, and also tying up several loose ends secondary character wise. Jack and George play a vital role in this installment, and I loved how they were able to get some closure with regards to their father's abandonment. Sophie gets a piece of Spider for fusing her mother, and even Rose, Declan & Kaldar had brief cameos. As much as I enjoyed the action, I actually liked Charlotte's poised manipulations and tutelage of Lark more. It takes finesse to defeat a foe with a sword, but even more so with words, and clever artifice. However, not everyone got their HEA unfortunately, poor sweet \u00c9l\u00e9onore... And, was it just me, or were there sparks between George and Sophie? Potential spin-off?I've now had the pleasure of listening to eleven audiobooks from Ilona Andrews and Ren\u00e9e Raudman, and let me tell you, the experience is in no danger of getting old. There are many reasons why this trio makes up the bulk of my Audible library including spellbinding performances, flawless pacing, and masterful tone. Raudman is the voice behind the Andrews' written word, breathes life into all of their memorable characters, and makes listeners feel like they inhabit this author duo's fictional worlds. If you're still on the fence about audiobooks, I highly recommend that you give these a try, you won't regret it! In fact, your house may end up cleaner than it has even been because you'll find yourself actively seeking out excuses to read hands-fee.STEEL'S EDGE was the ultimate epitome of go big or go home!

However, there is a darkside to being a healer, they can as easily start a plague as they can heal one, but to do so is to become an abomination. But once Charlotte tastes the darker side of being a healer, she escapes to the Edge to find peace. That is, until Richard Mar stumbles almost dead on to her doorstep with dangerous enemies in pursuit and a cause that Charlotte can't turn her back on. It is no big secret that I am a HUGE fan of Ilona and Gordon Andrews and Steel's Edge is a great example of why; full of adventure, humour and romance I couldn't put it down, my eyes became glued to the page, which let me tell you made it extremely awkward to shower, good job I demolished this book in under 24 hours! For me this was the best in the series and I am glad it is ending on a high (although, you will see my little rant about this series ending at the end of the review!) the fantastic world of the Edge and the Weird has been built up over the previous three books and has created a perfect setting for Charlotte and Richard to wage their war on slavery as well as develop a romance. Charlotte and Richard were great characters, Charlotte was completely different from the other heroines in this series keeping it fresh and interesting and Richard has intrigued me from when he was first introduced in Bayou Moon. Charlotte and Richard's journey together puts them through so many emotional highs and lows making a swashbuckling adventure story into something a little more as they try and right wrongs without losing themselves along the way. The mixture of fast paced action, humour and an intelligent storyline kept me turning the pages with relish.But I am also an avid romance reader so seeing Richard and Charlotte come together so passionately and sweetly after being through so much was also part of the reason I read so greedily. Then there is George and Jack; from the very beginning of this series I have loved them and I am glad that once again they had a fairly big on page presence.The Andrews have once again written a winner and I am begging them to PLEASE NOT STOP! Or at least write a book for Sophie, George and Jack, we have watched them grow from children to teenagers and I don't think I am alone in wanting to know what they do next.

And of course, the awesome thing about these books is that they are really entertaining, you pick them up, you start reading and you keep on reading until the book is done.They're highly addictive.One problem I do have with this series is that it doesn't really end!At the end of this book there are still several sub-plots that are not finished. We don't get to know what happens with Spider, or see George, Jack and Sophie's stories. I think that's really sad and I'm so happy that Ilona decided to combine this with the Innkeeper series in other to bring a bit of closure."}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8575414-emma", "userReview": "The final book in the Edge series- the same high standard as the rest of the series. This time, the budding couple take on illegal slavery and the entire Mar family team helps on the mission, with Jack and George along for the ride. The Ilona Andrews team have created such a full and rich magical setting and world that these books are really quite engrossing- and it's not all about the romance either.

I enjoyed healer's transformation into plague-bearer (welcome to the dark side!) I enjoyed the darkness, the gruesome deaths, the tragedy even, action scenes filled with sword fights and dark magic. I enjoyed beginning of the romance with playful dialogues and Princess Bride references. The first half was intense and griping and I've read it one sitting. Would have given it 5*.But then we get to the part where espionage and scam come into play and it didn't quite work for me. Affair hinged on impersonating the suspect's friend/business partner by changing one of the main character's face via plastic surgery. Well... what about voice, facial expressions, manners, hands, temper, favourite sayings, body language? If it was just a passing glance - perhaps - but face to face conversation in a daylight - I just don't buy it. Anyone calling themselves a friend would notice the difference. Trickery also involved balls, dances, different colour and cut gowns (yawn) and polite tea party conversations (zzzzz..). Not to mentioned that romance at this point became soppy and melodramatic...Anyhow, this is I.Andrews we are talking about - it wasn't all that bad. :) Action picked up in the end. All in all I enjoyed this series immensely. I recommend it to anyone who likes action packed fantasy with touch of humour and romance."}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40997852-nicole", "userReview": "On the Edge (The Edge #1): \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Bayou Moon (The Edge #2): \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Fate's Edge (The Edge #3): \u2605\u2605This is the last book of \u201cThe Edge\u201d series. After not liking the previous one, at all, I avoided reading this book for a long while but eventually, my desire to read Clean Sweep won. I can only thank Annie for reading this book with me or it would\u2019ve taken more even more time to read. Especially since we didn\u2019t like Kaldar\u2019s story. And he\u2019s the fun guy\u2026 so you can say I did not like Richard. Nothing personal, he just never appealed to me. Turns out, this book is more enjoyable than Fate\u2019s Edge. However, the kids continued to be the most interesting thing about the book. Charlotte used to be a Healer before leaving to the Edge, since her husband from the weird turned out to be a complete asshole. Richard\u2019s ex-wife was also a bitch and left him for a richer life in the Broken. Now he is known as the Hunter, he hunts slavers for what they did to one of his relatives. Because of a spoiler, Charlotte now also want to kill all slavers. After rescuing him from some nasty slavers, they make a deal. They will help each other to expose a slavery ring. You see, what I didn\u2019t expect was for Charlotte to turn out a total badass. Silly me, it\u2019s Ilona Andrews, I should\u2019ve known better, I know. I expected a fragile healer and not one who is ready to the forbidden and use her ability to kill. So that was a plus. On the other hand, Richard was likable (something I can\u2019t say about his brother. I just can\u2019t stand him). Nothing memorable but not bad. Their love story took more than 2 weeks to wrap up! Something I can\u2019t say about the other books. I finished it in 2 days so it was a pageturner (since I was reading other books at the same time).However, this book is no match for the first 2. My favorite moments were with George, Jack, and Sophie. The kids are so damn interesting\u2026 and adorable, of course! I\u2019m so looking forward to knowing where their story will go in the Innkeeper\u2019s Chronicles. And is there a romance between George and Sophie?? I totally ship this! They again played an important role in the book and made it more enjoyable. Easily the best thing about this novel.I quite liked the mission in this book. The little politics in the Adrianglia, the nobles there, trying to expose an important person in the country, all of it made the story entertaining. Along with well-developed and likable characters, this book was decent-ish. Nothing outstanding but much better than I expected! Steel\u2019s Edge wasn\u2019t a proper conclusion to this series, in my opinion. We know the destiny of some characters who played an important role in former books and others we wondered about. However, many questions were left unanswered. Truthfully, I don\u2019t mind letting this series go since I don\u2019t think I can digest more similar stories. I mean sure, they are fun BUT I\u2019m not a fan of series in which each book features the love story of a character we\u2019ve met before."}, {"userName": "Experiment BL626", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4582872-experiment-bl626", "userReview": "Snippets from the Authors' BlogMonday Snippet \u2013 Charlotte de Ney by Ilona Andrews.

Charlotte may be a healer but she bared her backbone and I knew we were going to have some fun. I cannot believe how badass she was. The clever twist in her ability was wicked and deadly. Trust me when I say you do not want to get on Charlotte\u2019 bad side. We first meet Richard in Bayou Moon and I was delighted to see him as our hero. Because these characters are older, they are comfortable in their own skin and know what they want. Both are unwilling to settle and this made their growing romance delightful to watch. A little snark, banter and tender moments had me caught up.Steel\u2019s Edge delivered an intense tale as Richard and Charlotte go after a slave trade with deep connections. I loved the way they battled together. His blade to her gift was the perfect match. He was calm, she seethed and it totally worked. Once again, Jack and George are vital to the mission and gads but I adore these two. Rose, Declan and Kaldar make appearances and Sophie gets a little revenge.While the Andrews weaved threads of the overall story arc into the tale giving us long-awaited answers and resolutions there was also some developments that leave the door open a crack for further visits to this world.As you have probably figured out if you stay caffeinated, I listen to all Ilona Andrews\u2019 books.

Everybody likes it, nobody is 100% sure what it is. The series is now complete at four books. I first picked up On the Edge (book 1) right after reading book 4 of Kate Daniel series. No one can avoid book hungover after finishing book 3 and book 4 in Kate Daniel series. So, at the time, I wasn\u2019t impressed with On the Edge. These past few weeks, I reread On the Edge and finished the series in a row. Man. I have been enjoying this series a lot and while each book features different LCs, the world building and the supporting cast are mostly well-integrated.

Why it did or didn't work for me: This couple. They worked. They were beautiful together. Their conversations and thoughts about each other. Their connection. It all works. So wonderfully well. This couple, together, made up my favorite of the entire series. And what would this series be without Jack and George. They make yet another appearance and every second of it is so worth it.

The Edge series and the Kate Daniel's series are just simply auto-buys for me. I know what I'm going to get going into them: Nice sexual tension, a very well written story, and something fresh and different in the UF/PNR world. \"Steel's Edge\" didn't disappoint in that respect. I love the Mar family and have been wanting to read Richard's story for a while so I was just giddy to start this one. My overall take on this book is very positive. There is so much to like about this book: stellar characters that are really vivid, lots of action, and a nice romance. However, the book wasn't perfect, hence not a 5 star read for me. First off, it was a bit long-winded. I could have used about 50 pages less, some more tightening up of the story. I just felt like the pacing was off and the book dragged a bit in the end. In addition, the book tried to do a bit too much. They threw in Spider, and all of the previous characters, and the Mirror and the Hand... it got a bit chaotic in the end. I would have preferred it if the story was a more streamlined. Finally, and this is nit-picking, Charlotte wasn't as engaging of a character for me as previous Edge heroines. I just felt a bit more blah about her, though I was excited by her power.

I was so happy that I finally found the time to read the book. My only wish was that I could have read all four stories back-to-back. I read ON THE EDGE in 2010 and I mistakenly let too much time expire between each story. My bad. I love the word-building of husband and wife team, Ilona Andrews. For some people it can be cumbersome because they start each story at a slow pace. There was a lot of ground to cover and this will put off some readers. But they are one of the few twosomes that I think compose with a single mind. The characters are noteworthy with their distinct personalities and absorbing backgrounds. As I previously mentioned, the beginning starts out slowly but it was rich in content. The action comes later on. In STEEL'S EDGE, many of primary characters from books 1 and 3 return. But repetitiveness, often the bane of authors that write series, was written tastefully and, more importantly, not overdone. It never bodes well when an author devotes too much time dwelling on and rehashing what occurred in previous stories.Lady Charlotte was a kicka** heroine who was cautious, charming and deadly. She had deep morals and was always conscious of where the line was drawn between good and evil. She strived to do her best knowing that she might turn over to the dark side.Richard was an Edger: possessive, quiet and an assassin with a family. He killed with efficiency before meeting Charlotte and would continue to do anything  to keep her safe. This was an adult urban-fantasy. The few sexual situations were detailed. There was plenty of killing really, really bad people. There was a monstrous wolfripper dog that turned into putty, teenagers with moments of angst, snarky humor and some nasty, scum-of-the-earth villains and villainesses with disturbing moments. It was darker and grittier than the previous stories. I believe it is imperative that you read the other books first and in order; otherwise many of the events that occur here won't make sense. I have been in a reading slump as of late. I have started many stories this month and set them aside for one reason or another. But this one worked.
