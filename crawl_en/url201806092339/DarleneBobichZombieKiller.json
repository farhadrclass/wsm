I picked this book up for free, and was in the mood for a good zombie story. It started off promising enough. Darlene is a young woman (mid-20s) who finds herself swept up in the imminent zombie apocalypse. Civilization is crumbling around her. Fortunately, her father taught her how to take care of herself. She has a Desert Eagle (basically a .50 cal hand cannon) and knows how to use it. This and her natural pluck and determination make her a survivor. So far so good.If the story had stayed on the rails, we'd have a pretty good story. I like a good zombie survival story and it's good to see a strong woman as the lead character. Unfortunately, this book goes down some very dark roads. For a strong female lead, Darlene certainly winds up clad only in her underwear, topless, or buck naked an awful lot. Seriously, do the zombies have some sort of alarm system that notifies them when our heroine is changing clothes or something?Now you may be telling yourself as a red-blooded male with a healthy appreciation for the female form, maybe that's not so bad. A buxom half-naked young woman running around gunning down zombies; what's not to like? Rape. Rape is something not to like. Darlene finds herself repeatedly at the mercy of some nasty dudes. Sure, she kills them, but really? Plus, it's just not something that I'd prefer to read about.But, Mr. Matt, you may be thinking, rape does happen. Imagine a post-apocalyptic world. Order has broken down. Surely bad characters would be taking all sorts of liberties with people. True. I imagine that they would. And, I guess, it might be something that could appear in stories about those post zombie worlds. Maybe I am over-reacting and being a prude?Nope. You almost had me. I almost fell for your line of thinking and then the other shoe dropped. The other thing I just can't handle are the zombies (the male ones) sprouting ... um ... aroused ... uh ... boy parts and ... um ... doing ... stuff ... to the hapless females that they run down. You gotta draw a line somewhere and zombie rape seems over that line.1 terribad star out of 5. Long story short, this train wreck of a novelette goes from slightly salty to highly questionable to absolutely over the line. If I could give it fewer stars, I would."}, {"userName": "Alana Woods", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6773454-alana-woods", "userReview": "Armand Rosamillia writes about a post-apocalytic world overrun by zombies. He doesn\u2019t explain how it has happened because that\u2019s not his focus. His focus is on the surviving humans and how they stay alive, or don\u2019t. This review covers two short novellas that follow one character: Darlene Bobich. The first is 'Darlene Bobich, zombie killer', the second is 'Dying days'. The zombies are incidental, really. It could be any enemy the surviving humans are attempting to avoid or, if encountered, kill before being bitten and turning into zombies themselves.While reading I was reminded of a film and another series of books. Do you remember seeing 'Pulp fiction' for the first time? I had no idea what it was about and I remember bursting into laughter and clamping my mouth shut thinking I\u2019d done the wrong thing, only to hear other people laugh after me. These books had that effect on me.Then there\u2019s the heroine, Darlene. She reminded me of Stephanie Plum in Janet Evanovich\u2019s series. Vulnerable but not about to let anyone get the better of her. 'Dying days' doesn\u2019t finish Darlene\u2019s story so I imagine there\u2019s another in the pipeline, if not already published.These aren\u2019t literary novels but I don\u2019t think the author intended them to be. I think he intended them to be easy, fun reads, if you can call zombies fun, and they are certainly that."}, {"userName": "Pheebz", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32536934-pheebz", "userReview": "Another winner from Armand Rosamilia.What would it be like to be a seventeen year old girl ,when the world went down the drain?

Darlene is a well drawn character who feels real. She kicks much ass but is human and makes mistakes along the way. The stories are short but give you insight into what makes the character tick as well as how life during the zombie apocalypse could be. The pace of the book flowed well and this was a quick read. This book gave me a good introduction to the Dying days world and I'm excited to read more books in the series. This book is highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Michelle Perry", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47890275-michelle-perry", "userReview": "I detest the huge trend toward zombie apocalypse in the last decade or so. My son is enamored with them. My friends look at me as if I have grown two heads when I admit that I haven\u2019t seen the latest episode of whichever zombie television show is ruling the airwaves. I even avoid zombies trending on social media. I say all this just to be sure that my next words will be fully understood.I truly enjoyed reading this anthology. Darlene is a fantastically human character that finds strength when the world goes to hell. Not everyone would and clearly, reading through this anthology not everyone did. As often tends to be the case when anarchy rules, in this story the survivors turn into creatures that are different from the monsters only if you count their heartbeats. Darlene Bobich is well told tale of a young woman forced to keep moving in order to stay alive. Along the way she scrounges what supplies she finds and often must face the possibility that her life isn\u2019t the highest price she can pay for survival. Drifting across the eastern seaboard she meets a colorful cast of characters, most of whom are not long for this world and others you find yourself wishing, hoping, that they aren\u2019t. Racing from gangs of rapists, looters, cutthroats and simply very scared people Darlene\u2019s life is certainly exciting, and oh yeah, there is the constant threat of the undead to contend with.All said, I do have a couple of issues. I wish that Darlene had a more clear objective in mind. While the moving from place to place do keep the stories flowing, it is not always clear where they are flowing to. This is a book of short stories and the prequel to a series, so I am almost sure this issue will work itself out. Also, I see no need for the zombies\u2019 overt violence toward women. It doesn\u2019t add anything to make the undead creatures more terrifying and it really doesn\u2019t add anything to story with hordes of surviving humans already behaving in the same manner. It actually detracts from what otherwise is an intense thrill ride.I am looking forward to reading more adventures with Darlene Bobich. This book contains adult themes and intense violence"}, {"userName": "David Caldwell", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5082045-david-caldwell", "userReview": "Darlene finds herself as one of the few survivors of the Zombie apocalypse. Armed with her Desert Eagle, she struggles to survive day by day. She learns that her fellow survivors can be just as dangerous as the zombies.There isn't some great plan here. Darlene goes from one encounter to another in a rather haphazard fashion. The zombies are relentless and it seems every male that she meets is a rapist, including the male zombies. Allies are temporary at best.The parts I really liked is that Darlene is basically a normal person. She doesn't have some supernatural ability to help her kill zombies. She knows it is best to run away if possible and is just as worried about finding food as fighting zombies.The things I didn't care for that much was all of the rape talk. Even the zombies wanted to rape. Another small annoyance was that there are a handful of minor typos throughout the book.The format is a little different than most books. Each chapter is a fairly short encounter. Quite often events are left hanging as Darlene continues her travels. The biggest unanswered happening was a character getting bitten and nothing was mentioned about it again. As a minor note, the book is supposed to contain actual page numbers but I noticed two or three pages might share the same number and other pages are skipped.Fans of zombie fiction should enjoy this but they also might think there isn't that much different from a lot of other zombie stories out there."}, {"userName": "Frank", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3983118-frank", "userReview": "Armand Rosamilia delivers the prequel story to his DYING DAYS series with a collection of short stories called DARLENE BOBBICH: ZOMBIE KILLER. While the this is a short story collection, truly it reads as one long novella. The fact of the matter is that each story wound up published in different places. Read back to back they form a single story and that story sets up the events of the DYING DAYS series.When I first read DYING DAYS I was getting really bored of zombie fiction. Armand Rosamilia proved to me there is still quality story telling that can be done within the genre. This collection reads just as sweet as DYING DAYS. Once again, Rosamilia is able to make a zombie story that is more about the living then it is the dead.You don't need to have started the DYING DAYS series to start here. And if you've already started reading the DYING DAYS series this is a must for important back story on Darlene Bobbich the series heroine. Either way you will be treated to that comfortable way Armand Rosamilia has with telling a gripping story."}, {"userName": "Kat", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3835702-kat", "userReview": "Darlene Bobich: Zombie Killer is a novella that packs a lot into its 110 pages. Darlene finds herself alone after the zombieapocalypse claims her only family, her father - as she travels around the US in search of something she never seems quite sure of, she encounters the good, the bad, and the ugly of the remaining human population.Mr. Rosamilia has a strong imagination when it comes to a zombieapocalypse, which makes Darlene Bobich: Zombie Killer a fun, intense zombie read. As a series of 'short stories', this is a simply a snapshot of what happens to Darlene on the road but it's easy to like Darlene as a character - although she appears to be as tough as nails she has very real fears and emotions that are displayed throughout the story.I really enjoyed this one, it was a quick but memorable read and I'll definitely be checking out more of Mr. Rosamilia's work.Read more of my reviews at The Aussie Zombie"}, {"userName": "Kysha", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9725930-kysha", "userReview": "I haven't read a zombie story in forever so I decided to try some newer ones. This book is actually a compilation of short stories by the author about Darlene Bobich. Just like most zombie stories/movies it focuses on the living not the dead. She travels alone for most of the stories, but does have companions in a few. It seems like every man she meets rapes and beats her. I know humans are ruthless and not that far detached from animals, but really? EVERY MAN! Even the zombies rape people. Serioiusly?The overall story telling is mediocre at best. The stories are typical and been done. I read the whole thing just hoping that part of it would be good. It wasn't.I will not be seeking out the two novels that follow this anthology.I also wasn't impressed by the cover. I know that authors have little control over cover design, btu this one is just stupid looking. It really shows nothing to do with the stories. Also she only has 1 gun that she constantly carries, a Desert Eagle."}, {"userName": "Brian", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32618134-brian", "userReview": "***This a copy of the review posted to Amazon**This is not my first read in The Dying Days' world but it is the most fun. The adventures of Darlene Bobich is wildly entertaining. She is living in a world where you needs smarts, muscles, and a lot of luck. In these shorts stories, Darlene goes from one life threatening area to another. She makes a few friends but also trusts the wrong people and the result is horrifying. She is beat and raped, escapes numerous traps, and slashes the Zombies.The author's writing style seems to change with each book which allows him to build characters in different ways. His tone and descriptive changes as quickly as the Zombies are dispatched.If you like Zombies and a fan of Mr. Rosamilia, you will like this book."}, {"userName": "Eric Lahti", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25894861-eric-lahti", "userReview": "Just finished this entertaining yarn about a tough girl, her Desert Eagle, and her indomitable will to survive in a world gone mad. This is the literary equivalent of a bottle of good tequila, a pack of smokes, and rough and tumble bar. In other words, great fun.
