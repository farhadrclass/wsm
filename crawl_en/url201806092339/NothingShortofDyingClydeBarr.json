I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher in exchange for an honest review. This is an amazing debut novel by Erik Storey! Clyde Barr gets a frantic phone call from his sister, Jen, obviously in distress and in deep trouble. She needs his help and Clyde will do \u2018nothing short of dying\u2019 to save her. Clyde is one of the most interesting protagonists to come along in crime fiction in a while. As the story begins, Clyde has just been released from prison, but don't let that fool you. He has a code of honor he lives by, and helping people in need happens to be his specialty, but it is especially important when it comes to Jen, the sister he shares a very close bond with. So, leaving his peaceful Utah sanctuary, he heads to the rugged Colorado back country in search of Jen, determined to bring her home safe and sound. From this point on, the story takes on an adventuresome quality as Clyde meets a woman who can help him find Jen and insists on coming along with him. The terrain they must travel over is rough, off the grid, with no technological help available. They must survive in a minimalist sort of way, hunting for food, showering in the rain, sleeping in tents, all while living on the edge of extreme danger from the men who are holding Jen hostage. As the story unfolds, Clyde relates to the reader, via a first person narrative, his relationship with his sister and why they are so close despite, or because of, their turbulent upbringing. Clyde has never been able to stabilize, having spent significant time in Africa, then in prison, and is a bit of a loner/drifter. I get the idea he\u2019s like a poor man\u2019s \u2018Jack Reacher\u2019 and that his adventures are only just beginning. I predict the return of Clyde Barr and I rather doubt he will stay in one place for too long, and will always find a battle to fight on behalf of those unable to fight for themselves. Overall, this is a gritty thriller, absorbing, suspenseful, fast paced and a multi-layered action-adventure, with compelling characters, emotional twists, and poignant, bittersweet coda. Clyde learns a few life lessons along the way, that will most assuredly aide him in his quest to live in the moment and take life as it comes. For a debut novel, this one is most impressive. Well written, perfectly paced, with excellent, often profound dialogue, constructed in a way that will appeal to a wide range of readers, from adventure lovers to the crime drama enthusiast. Highly recommend!"}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2337007-brenda", "userReview": "The unexpected telephone call from the sister Clyde Barr hadn\u2019t seen or spoken to in years had him making a promise and packing up his camp to head to a civilisation he hadn\u2019t wanted to return to. Jen\u2019s panicked call which had abruptly ended had sent chills down Barr\u2019s spine \u2013 he knew she was in trouble; he also knew he had to find her before it was too late.Barr had been out of his family\u2019s lives for sixteen years \u2013 travelling across various countries while working as a soldier, a hunter and more. His skills were legendary; tough, fast and lethal, he was not a man to cross. His initial search to find a connection to Jen led him into the dark world of drugs \u2013 the apparent kidnapper was a feared person who was known to stop at nothing to gain control over the drug trade in the west of the United States. The only thing in both Barr\u2019s and Jen\u2019s favour was that Jen was needed alive for something. But would he get to her in time?Joining forces with a stubborn Allie, Barr was at first reluctant to put her in danger. But she had an agenda and wouldn\u2019t be fobbed off. Also she knew what the person they were after looked like. The race was on, but so were the continued attempts to stop them. The dangers were high \u2013 being alert 24/7 was wearing, but they had no choice. As they wound their way into the vast forests of Colorado, Barr felt confident; more at home in the wilderness than the cities. But had they underestimated their enemy? Barr knew that nothing short of dying would stop him finding the sister he was so close to when they were young\u2026Brilliant! So hard to believe Nothing Short of Dying is a debut novel by Erik Storey. Fast paced, original and full of action from the very first page, I raced through it. An excellent thriller, Barr is a great protagonist; his determination to succeed puts him in dangerous situations on a constant basis \u2013 and he doesn\u2019t always win! With this one being #1 in a new series, I\u2019ll be keen to read the next one.

I guess the idea of someone with a shady, perhaps troubled past, yet nothing really to tie them down, provides an appealing canvas from which to create a story. Clyde Barr has seen a lot in his life. A troubled adolescence led him to escape his Colorado home at a young age, seeking fortune and adventure elsewhere. As a hunter, soldier of fortune, and even a convict taking on anyone he sees as a threat, he's had more than his share of violence, death, and visions of destruction to last him a lifetime. He's ready to put the past behind him, and spend his days living off the land and sleeping in the mountains.And then a phone call comes from his sister Jen, whom he has always sworn to protect since they were growing up. Jen begs him to come and rescue her\u2014and then the call abruptly ends. Memories of their shared hellish adolescence return. He doesn't know who has taken her, where she is, or even if she is still alive, but Clyde knows he has no choice but to hunt down those who have kidnapped his sister so he can bring her home, no matter what.\"Those who needed help always managed to find me, no matter where I hid. They tracked me down and pleaded. And I never refused. Somehow, that always caused bigger problems.\"As Clyde struggles to determine Jen's whereabouts and the identity of her kidnappers, he unwittingly finds himself wading deeper and deeper into the middle of a narcotics ring run by a madman and his henchmen. Clyde is no stranger to violence or depravity, but these people stretch even his imagination. He connects with Allie, a bartender who has her own reasons for going on the run, and he looks up some old friends to help him find his sister. But who can he trust? And will finding Jen mean sacrificing his own life in exchange?I found this book to be pretty compelling, and Clyde Barr is a really fascinating protagonist. He's got a penchant for fighting, a fairly strong threshold for pain, and a hair-trigger temper, which makes him a fun character to read about. This is Erik Storey's first novel, and I think he does a great job in developing his characters' backstories while keeping the action and suspense fairly taut and focused. Even if the plot isn't necessarily surprising, Storey keeps you reading, keeps you invested in what will happen to the characters.I like thrillers but sometimes find them utterly implausible or not capable of sustaining my interest. \nNothing Short of Dying\n is neither of these; it's well-told, takes off at breakneck speed, and doesn't really look back. Definitely a worthy entry in the genre.NetGalley and Scribner provided me an advance copy of the book in exchange for an unbiased review.

Clyde has been a soldier of fortune, fought in wars and more recently been incarcerated in Mexico. He knows how to fight and play dirty but underneath he has a basic honorable code of ethics and can recognise evil when he comes across it. This is a high octane adventure of the Jack Reacher type as Clyde attempts to rescue his sister, blow up a major drug racket and keep safe Allie, the girl he picked up along the way. Plenty of fast paced, gritty action in this excellent debut novel.

He had hoped for a storybook homecoming; however, in reality, this was not a dream life. He likes the wilderness and living off the grid, with no technology or frills.cdsJen, his sister  called with a desperate SOS- she needed for him to come and get her. Throughout their childhood, they had been through nights of their mom and dad fighting, mom\u2019s boyfriends, drunks, loss of control, fighting, and abuse. Mostly hiding out to ride out the storm. The two of them against the world. They have secrets. Jen explained  in a whispered voice, for Clyde to hurry, he was going to kill her. She was to help, and then he would kill her. She reminded him he owed her. Before she could tell him where she was, Barr heard a male voice and the line went dead. He was her flesh and blood.  She had a knack for finding the wrong people, times, and places. He had left her to fend for herself because he had been selfish. Now he owed her. This was his chance to make up for his mistakes; however, he needed a track to follow, a direction. Barr knows that nothing short of dying will stop him from saving her.After their dad left,  and their mom died, he did something stupid which almost got him killed. Jen did something worse that saved his life. If anyone ever found out what they had done, they would be serving life sentences. Jen kept quiet and he was free. They had been to hell and back. He would do whatever she asked. Clyde begins his journey  for his sister. She was in trouble again and most likely mixed up with somebody very dangerous. From Colorado, outdoorsman, Clyde Barr returns to the states after serving as a gun for hire in Africa and South American. After leaving Juarez prison, Clyde is camping and receives the phone call. He has no clue where she could be. He has had no contact with his family in years.On his journey,  he meets Allie Martin, a bartender. They both are equally stubborn. Soon a relationship develops as they travel deeper into the remote Colorado\u2019s high country. From drug-ring politics, meth houses, and violence. However, despite the challenges, nothing will stop Barr from reaching his sister, and his strong loyalty to family and blood. What he was dealing with, he had underestimated. In a matter of days, he was dealing with drug dealer gangs, feds, and a girl who started to mean something. So much, for the quiet life. Shortly thereafter, an intense race against time.Storey,  introduces strong female characters, in addition to Barr, for women readers; Allie and Jen, which proves riveting heroes in their own right. Jen is no poor victim. A gal who can handle herself. With a rich cast of characters, an action-packed tale of grit, emotion, desperation, and the resilience of family. From good to evil, the author explores both extremes. New fans will anxiously be awaiting the next installment of pulp-action hero, Clyde Barr. Stark and gripping, with a strong sense of place in rural rich areas, and bold nuanced characterization reminiscent, of Ace Atkins, Lee Child (Jack Reacher), Craig Johnson, and CJ Box.As the author mentions  in an interview, \u201cThe book isn\u2019t a cup of tea at all; it\u2019s whiskey on the rocks.\u201d Indeed, it is like sipping and savoring the spirit. So grab a glass, pour yourself some whiskey, kick back in your leather man (or woman) chair, and do some taste testing and follow Clyde Bar on his adventure. Feel like kickin\u2019 it old school? Have your whiskey in a tin cup in the great outdoors, a perfect side-kick for Nothing Short of Dying.I am always fascinated with the inspiration behind books and authors. Thoroughly enjoyed the  Interview with Erik Storey.  \u201cI wanted to show off this side of the state,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt\u2019s not as visited as Denver. Western Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Idaho \u2014 they\u2019re kind of forgotten. People will fly into the cities, but because the population density is so small, they overlook the rest of the region. To a lot of people, the West is kind of an obscure concept. I want to promote this area with my books. As Clyde\u2019s quest takes him from small town to small town throughout Colorado \u2014 Riverside, Clifton, Palisade, De Beque, Rifle, Meeker, Mack, Leadville, Steamboat Springs \u2014 he unearths both the grandeur and grit of life in the high country and on the Western Slope. What does define Clyde\u2019s character, besides his tenacity and honor, is a deep distrust of cell phones, apps, computers and every other innovation that distracts from the simplicity of humanity\u2019s bond with the land? In addition to the advanced reading copy, also purchased the audio version, narrated by Jeremy Bobb (sexy, edgy, gritty), a perfect match for Storey\u2019s smashing debut, for a full throttle performance ride.Worthy of the hype, Nothing Short of Dying,  equal parts rural country noir and contemporary Western, with a tough hero to stand up and cheer for, and not to be messed with. A rugged guy, the kind you would want to be alone in the wilderness with, for more than one reason. Storey is an author  to follow with many epic-adventures to follow. Sounds like we will visit Clyde next, as he wanders onto a Native American reservation, which mysteriously seems to have been taken over by an outlaw biker gang \u2013 and there\u2019s report of terrorist activity in the area. A Promise to KillCan\u2019t wait. Movie worthy. Awesome cover. Bring it on! A special thank you to Scribner and NetGalley for an ARC in exchange for an honest review.

After the last few years, who can blame him - mercenary and hired gun on three different continents, prisoner on one - call him what you want, he's tired and needs to regain some sense of himself. He also doesn't really need the added complications of electronic communication like a mobile phone but, in this day and age, it seems to be a must-have.Only problem is, the next call he receives is going to shatter his much sought-after solitude with a cry for help from his youngest sister who doesn\u2019t even get a chance to let him know where she is!In trying to figure out her whereabouts and who may have her, he finds himself teaming up with Allie, a bartender with her own reasons for running, who just might know the answer to that question. Together they begin the search! Travelling through wide open spaces and into the mountains looking for clues, they also find themselves fighting for their lives when they cross the paths of some ruthless drug dealers and are double-crossed by someone Clyde once called a friend!As the bodies pile up and he and Allie grow closer, vignettes of a fractured family, abusive relationships and an obscure past begin to form the patchwork of history that is Clyde Barr.This one had been glaring at me from my reading pile for some time and, not having read a \u201cJack Reacher\u201d novel (to whom Clyde Barr has been compared), I wasn\u2019t quite sure what to expect. I picked it up anyway, thinking that I\u2019d \u201cexpand my horizons\u201d so to speak \u2013 and I\u2019m so glad that I did because Erik Storey is a remarkable storyteller.Not only does he give us non-stop action right the way through but in Clyde Barr, he introduces us to an extremely complex man, slowly peeling back the layers to reveal an honourable, albeit tough-as-nails hero. He\u2019s rugged, a wanderer with a strong sense of justice, tough but soft when he needs to be and if there\u2019s one thing he loves more than anything else, it\u2019s his sisters \u2013 even if they\u2019re not all on speaking terms with him. As a woman, I could just fall in love with Clyde - he's not afraid or ashamed to stand up for what's right, he keeps his word and will always defend the underdog!There\u2019s a lot to enjoy in this novel which provided me with a few hours of adventurous escapism such as getting to know our hero whilst exploring Erik\u2019s lush setting of Colorado and the Appalachian Mountains that not only gives the reader a strong sense of place which is integral to the events unfolding around Clyde, but also shows that Erik knows it well.Another big plus for me was that while there are a number of violent scenes (which is to be expected from the genre), Erik doesn\u2019t expose the reader to too much guts and gore. And, once his characters have served their purpose, he has no qualms about expiring them along the way.Clyde Barr is an appealing lead character and Erik Storey\u2019s skill as a writer shines, making it hard to believe that this is a debut. He also strikes the right emotional balance so if you, like me, prefer your action thriller novels not to forsake depth, then don\u2019t hesitate to get this one on your list so that you too can welcome knight errant, Clyde Barr, to the fold. With non-stop action right the way through and a skilfully crafted plot that picks up steadily, this is compulsive reading at its best from an author who is putting true adventure back into the action thriller genre. In saying that, I can confirm that I\u2019m definitely a fan and that nothing short of dying will stop me from reading the next novel in the series!"}, {"userName": "Benoit Leli\u00e8vre", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3634428-benoit-leli-vre", "userReview": "I usually don't like this type of novel very much, but I have to admit this one was very well executed. NOTHING SHORT OF DYING is an action thriller in the vein of Jack Reacher novels. It might not have the intricate mystery aspect of Lee Child's books, but it makes up with meaningful, pertinent action scenes that reveal bits about its character: hillbilly turned mercenary turned professional badass Clyde Barr.I had a love/hate relationship with Barr's exposition scenes, which I thought were very stereotypical, but gave his family a strangeness and an antagonistic edge that are rather uncommon in this type of books (what kind of big sister doesn't protect their little brother? This kind of things are interesting to me). Can't say NOTHING SHORT OF DYING was exactly my cup of tea, but I can't argue with the execution here. It's brilliantly delivered and it reads itself.

The action scenes themselves have for me at least a formulaic flow about them, and as a result did not engage me as much as I thought they would.

There was something else, too: the acrid sweat of the strung out\u2014a smell that reminded me of the little cantina in Bolivia where people in the coca trade use booze to come down from the powder cloud that gets them through the long shifts. If broken souls had an odor, they\u2019d smell like the Cellar.\u201dClyde Barr is full of keen little observations like that one. And he\u2019s not all bad boy.

After sixteen years lending his muscle and expertise in conflicts across Africa and beyond, taking care of the little guy, fighting for the downtrodden and choosing sides in various third world conflicts, Clyde is tired and feeling his age. Having recently been released from a spell in a Mexican prison where he barely made it out alive, he is back in his native Colorado, in the mountains he loves, looking forward to retirement from conflict, and a quieter way of life, when he receives a panic-stricken phone call from his beloved sister Jen, pleading with him to \"come and get her\". He has no idea where Jen is or who has abducted her, but since their shared and troubled childhood, Clyde and his older sister Jen have had a particular bond. Nothing will prevent him from rescuing her.And so it begins. Clyde's hunt for his sister is a roller-coaster of a ride through the wilderness, and small towns of America. A violent, bloody, modern day western of drug barons, hard men and hired guns. Throughout it all Clyde is driven by one thing - the need to save his sister. By day he mows down anyone who gets in his way, and at night he battles his demons, haunted by the memories of past conflicts, the women and children he failed to save, and the bloody bodies he left in his wake. Yet amid all this chaos, and the smell of gun smoke, Clyde shows us his softer side by finding the time to fall in love and rescue a damsel in distress, along the way.This is Erik Storey's debut novel. With this book he shows us what master story teller he is, and the quality of his writing sweeps the reader along and kept me up into the early hours. I really enjoyed this book.Thrillers are my usual genre of choice, although I don't usually go for action packed thrillers like this one. However, I really fell for Clyde Barr. He is Jack Reacher with a heart. He makes silly mistakes, really daft ones where you find yourself shaking your head in disbelief. He tries to do the right thing, he really wants to heal the world, but somehow he has to kill a load of bad men to make good things happen. This book is not for the faint hearted, but if you like thrillers, especially action thrillers, and if you long for the wild west where the lines between good and bad get a little blurry at times, and if you like your heroes, scarred, tough, and at times ruthless, and with a moral code all of their own, you will enjoy Nothing Short of Dying, like I did.The really great news is that Nothing Short of Dying is the first book in the Clyde Barr series. The bad news is we are going to have to wait for book two! If the second Clyde Barr novel is anything like the first, it will be worth the wait, and I plan to be first in the queue!Thank you to newbooks/nudge, the publisher Simon & Schuster UK, and the author Erik Storey for my free copy of Nothing Short of Dying, in return for an honest review."}, {"userName": "CL", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10871763-cl", "userReview": "Clyde Barr prefers to keep to himself away from everything and everyone when he receives a distress call from his sister for help.

It is an action packed page turner that I could not put down and eagerly await the next chapter in Clyde Barr's life - as I am sure there is more to come. He can be likened to Lee Child's Jack Reacher and Noah Boyd's The Bricklayer that I read recently. He's tough, intelligent, scared of no one or anything, he has strong family morals in keeping his family safe and protected and with his awful childhood history it makes you feel sympathy and respect for him.

Even in the press they say Jack Reacher needs to be worried by the new character Clyde Barr, to me he is more Rambo, but with brains, and more dangerous than Reacher. Jack Reacher may be the king of the thriller in the city, but Clyde Barr would eat him alive out in the wilderness.Jeffrey Deaver and CJ Box both recommend Erik Story and they are not wrong, he is a very talented writer, and such a brilliant storyteller, who knows how to keep you interested. He has created a story that paints the mountains and valleys of Colorado red with the blood of those who cross him. This book will grab you from page one all the way to the end and leave you breathless as this really is a roller coaster ride of emotions and passion.Since being released from a Mexican Jail Clyde Barr has been living in the wilds of Utah away from any humans, just him, nature and the big blue sky. When he receives a call from his sister Jen asking for him to come to her aid and rescue her, and Barr always keeps the promised he made, especially to his sister. Barr\u2019s most powerful instinct is also the one that could bring about his early demise, that he has to right the wrongs of the world. This compulsion is driven by his childhood where he and his sister suffered at the hands of his mother\u2019s boyfriends, and she at the hands of those boyfriends. He has made a life out of helping those in need especially in the Third World and in South and Central America.In his attempt to find his sister violence erupts around him like a volatile Icelandic volcano as men, just as war weary as himself. On his journey to find his sister amongst the drug lords of Colorado he finds one person who becomes his ally, Allie, and plenty of people who want to kill him. His mercenary skills that have served him so well across the world are called upon to help him survive, and what does become obvious is he has more lives than your average cat.Clyde Barr has all the skills of Rambo, but with the brains to use those friends he has to find his enemies who have his sister. It becomes very clear the only way that those who hold his sister will have to kill Barr to stop him. Problem is they have to find him first, and if they do keep hold of him.Nothing Short of Dying is one of the best debut thrillers I have read from an American author in a very long time. Barr is that classic anti-hero, everything about him screams avoid like the plague and Storey has created a character you cannot help but get behind. Barr is everything a modern man wants to be, when not sat on his sofa, a man mountain action man and survival specialist who is not to be messed with.Nothing Short of Dying is a thriller that is gritty, authentic and new with a character who men want to be and women want to be with. He is the bad ass we all wish we could be and delivers a relentless ride in to some very dark places on a thrill ride that is non-stop. This really is a brilliant thriller and hard to believe something so accomplished can be a debut, buckle up this is one hell of a ride."}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12691311-debbie", "userReview": "I'm not really sure which luck follows this Clyde character the most, good or bad.

It's flagged as something that will have Lee Child's Reacher watching over his shoulder which clearly flags this is action packed, with a lone hero up against it from all sides central character.Clyde Barr is a mountain man, hunter and a mercenary. After many years fighting conflicts in Africa amongst other places, and a torrid stint in a Mexican jail he's heading back to his native Colorado, out into the mountains, going bush as we'd say in Australia, looking for a low key sort of life. Which all goes to hell in a hand-basket when he gets a frantic call from one of his sisters, and heads out to save the day. At this point you start to find out that Barr's personal life is anything but uncomplicated, his family is fractured, his younger sister has been a bit of a trial and just about everybody is flat out nasty or at the very least disinterested. Unless you count Allie the barmaid with a sort of heart of gold and taste for adventure, who joins him on quest, serving as companion, love interest and recently arrived conscience or reason to get his act together.NOTHING SHORT OF DYING is really quite the roller-coaster ride, and in that I'm not just referring to the action packed, race to find and free the sister. There are many highs and lows in dealing with Barr to navigate as well. The action here is bloody and violent, there's a feeling of the wild west about the pace, and the free-wheeling bash, crash and killing spree. Whilst it's obvious that those who have taken Jen are definitely the black hat wearers, Barr's not so easy to pigeon-hole. There are times when he feels like part of the problem - with a tendency to wipe out anybody who even looks like they are going to get in his way, and times he's haunted by memories of things that have gone wrong in the past, people who he's failed to save, bodies he's left in his wake. And of course, there's a budding romance with Allie - who is carting around more than a few issues of her own.There were points where I absolutely loved NOTHING SHORT OF DYING, and points where I'd cheerfully have flung it across a room. Whilst there are aspects of Barr's characterisation that rang true, that has to balanced up against the constant concept of anything can be solved if you shoot it, hit it hard enough, or drive around it fast enough. All of which has been done - to death - before, although undoubtedly that doesn't sound particularly fair as the same could be said of lots of thrillers. It's all going to come down to a question of connection with Barr and even with Allie. If, as a reader he's somebody you instantly feel you can barrack for, or even just understand a bit, then the quibbles will disappear. If he's somebody you're struggling with, then the lack of subtlety, and the constant bang bang, shoot 'em up, loner out to save the day, getting it wrong, getting it right and the extreme violence is going to be less successful. NOTHING SHORT OF DYING is definitely one for readers to make their own minds up about.https://www.austcrimefiction.org/revi..."}, {"userName": "Garlan \u270c", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1979703-garlan", "userReview": "Lots of action and some pretty good writing, but the storyline wasn't very believable or even that interesting.

As I have said many times before, I am a huge Jack Reacher fan and I am always looking for a new series to fill the gaps. Having read the book now, I had every right to be as excited as I was because it was such a great read.Nothing Short of Dying is Erik Storey\u2019s first mystery thriller novel featuring drifter Clyde Barr. Clyde Barr is enjoying the quiet life in the Colorado wilderness after being released from prison, when he receives a frantic phone call from his sister Jen, who is being held hostage. Barr has no idea who has Jen and where they are, but he knows that it is up to him to find her, bring her home and protect her from danger.It would be an understatement to say that this book is fast-paced and action-packed. It is literally non-stop action from start to finish with a good story weaved in, just the way I like it. There is so much fighting and stuff going on throughout the book that it is a miracle that anyone is still able to stand at the end, but it is written so well that not once did I think that any of it was over the top. Erik Storey has the perfect writing style for the genre because he is efficient with his words but he is still able to get me to engage with the story and characters.Like pretty much every other book in the genre, the plot is pretty straightforward. It\u2019s got a little bit of mystery, but the real hero of the book is the action and the characters. The one thing that does set this book apart from the others in the genre is the use of the wilderness and the Western feel to it, which I thought was really cool and well done, especially as I am not overly interested in Westerns.I think one of the best parts of the book is the characters. Barr is a great lead character because he is flawed, but he is still a good guy and he can kick ass when he needs to as well. He has such an intriguing back story that really shapes his character and I could tell that this book only scratched the surface of it, so I am really interested to see how that progresses. The other great character was Allie. I normally don\u2019t find the secondary characters to anywhere near as good as the leads, but Allie was right up there with Barr. I found her to be the most relatable of all the characters in the book, so that is a real bonus.To sum it up, I was super excited when I first picked up the book and I was even more excited when I put it down at the end. I definitely feel that I have found a new author to add to my must-read pile. I am always looking out for ways to get my Jack Reacher fix and Nothing Short of Dying is written in a similar style, but is still different enough to not be a clone. It would be an understatement to say I am excited to see what happens to Barr next!Is it worth a read? If you like action-packed mystery thrillers with strong characters and a simple, but effective story, then Nothing Short of Dying is definitely worth a read. The best way to describe it is that Clyde Barr is what Jack Reacher would have been if he was a cowboy instead of a military policeman.This review was originally published at Worth a Read."}, {"userName": "Judy Lesley", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4814399-judy-lesley", "userReview": "I received an e-ARC of this novel through NetGalley and Scribner.I think there is the possibility of a good thriller series buried under the mound of dead bodies in this debut novel introducing Clyde Barr. I didn't connect enough with the lead character to make me anxiously await the second book in the series, though. Clyde doesn't really have much for me to connect with in this first book. Okay, he finds himself coming to the aid of underdogs, people having a hard time, people being mistreated. That's it? That's a pretty thin premise to set a series on. Clyde needs a whole range of things to make him more interesting because just killing people isn't going to keep readers interested for very long or at least not this reader. And it isn't even the high body count which was the problem for me. There is one series I follow where the protagonist went up against twelve professional assassins in the first book and lived to tell the tale, but the encounters were smart and different each time and showed the ability to think through a problem. Not Clyde; no Clyde goes barreling ahead and then tries to figure out how to work out the problem once the bullets, arrows or knives begin to fly.If author Erik Storey can formulate his main character into someone other than a one dimensional killer, and if he can ignore the comparisons between Clyde and Jack Reacher (really, there's only one Jack Reacher and comparisons are not doing this author any favors), then Clyde can become someone I want to read about and follow in his exploits. I'm hoping that growth of the character happens and I'm willing to give a second book a try."}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55150858-nicole", "userReview": "I was lucky enough to win a copy of this book via Goodreads Giveaways.I've read plenty of books of this genre; although I don't consider myself to be a connoisseur, I've been around the block a few times. The author brought enough new elements to the table to keep me interested and to not leave me feeling like I was reading \"just another man against the odds thriller\" (which, if I'm honest, I would've been happy enough reading anyway - it's a template I'm okay with - but it's nice when people colour outside the lines a little bit!) I liked the outdoorsy/survival-themed elements and the setting itself, I liked that the protagonist wasn't a suave and collected ladies' man like so many seem to be, or even a respected citizen at all, and that although he seemed a fairly typical 'tough loner' he wasn't magically equipped for everything that happened, too cool for school, or able to fully go it alone.Story-wise, it was satisfying in the way that most books of its ilk are, as it progressed steadily and reached a resolution in the standard sort of fashion! I don't like spoilers, so I'm not going into it further.While it's not breaking new ground and won't turn the thriller-fiction world on its head (what will?), I enjoyed reading it. It's a pretty solid first offering and I'll keep my eye out for anything else by the author; one would hope that since this is \"A\" Clyde Barr Novel rather than \"The\" Clyde Barr Novel, we might be treated to some more of the protagonist's adventures - all of which I'd be perfectly happy to settle in with a nice cup of tea and read."}, {"userName": "CL", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5456658-cl", "userReview": "ARC received from: GoodreadsRating: 5*One-Sentence Summary: Clyde Barr will stop at nothing to rescue his sisterReview: Very seldom do I come across a book so good that I will clear my entire day just to sit and read it in one go. This debut by Erik Storey was one of those!This book is being sold as the \"new Jack Reacher series\" and it was very much in that vein, except with even more fights and gun battles (if that's even possible!). It was non-stop action from start to finish with a few brief softer moments thrown in courtesy of a love interest of sorts. One of the key differences between Clyde Barr and Jack Reacher is the fact that Barr still has living relatives and his relationship with his three sisters is key to this book. His whole mission is to rescue his sister Jen and throughout the book there are flashbacks to Barr and Jen's childhood which helps explain why Barr is the way he is.With Barr's sisters, his murky job history and his time in prison, there is plenty of material here for hopefully a long and successful thriller series.

I was having a craving for a survivalist adventure through the mountains, high stakes and a dash of romance. It was all of that. But it was much grittier than I normally like to read. However, I found it to be refreshing from my usual predictable reads, particularly because there are no sacred cows in this story.The characters are well-created and memorable. I liked Clyde Barr for the most part. I like his soft spot for people in a pinch but a lot of times I caught myself shaking my head and saying \u201cidiot\u2026\u201d. I like a character that can make me do that. He\u2019s a broken hero with a savior complex and a MacGyver-like knack for getting himself in and out of pretty sticky situations. I found his relationship with his sister to be a bit\u2026weird. I don\u2019t know but I felt like at times it leant itself towards more like a romantic relationship would play out than one a result of traumatic experiences binding them together. Maybe that\u2019s just me.Other than that, the other relationships were believable and really enjoyable. Storey has a gift for character creation. The plot itself was pretty wild. Once the story took off, it stayed at a pretty heady clip all the way through the end. I\u2019m not sure if I would pick up another of these novels simply because, again, it\u2019s a bit darker and more violent than I usually enjoy reading but it could be a great fit for other thriller lovers.

I always enjoy books set in places I have been.Nothing Short of Dying is a great read for fans of William Kent Krueger, Lee Child and C.J. Box. I loved the ending.Promising new series...give Nothing Short of Dying a shot."}], "description": "Hailed by bestselling writer William Kent Krueger as \u201cthe year\u2019s best thriller debut,\u201d this furiously paced ride into harm\u2019s way features a drifter with lethal skills, whose mission to rescue his abducted sister pits him against a ruthless meth kingpin and his army of killers.Sixteen years.

All he knows is that nothing short of dying will stop him from saving her.Joining Clyde in his against-all-odds quest is a young woman named Allie whose motivations for running this gauntlet are fascinatingly complex. As the duo races against the clock, it is Allie who gets Clyde to see what he has become and what he can still be.Vivid with the hues and scents of Colorado\u2019s backcountry, and thought-provoking in its exploration of how past, present, and future collide to test resolve, Nothing Short of Dying is, above all, a propulsive, action-driven race against the clock.", "title": "Nothing Short of Dying\n      \n          (Clyde Barr #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27276269-nothing-short-of-dying", "average": 3.66, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1471180050l/27276269.jpg", "reviews": 229, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13993770.Erik_Storey", "name": "Erik Storey"}], "type": ["Thriller", "Fiction", "Mystery", "Mystery", "Suspense"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27276269-nothing-short-of-dying", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29957204-nothing-short-of-dying", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30184055-nothing-short-of-dying", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30366402-ovek-koji-je-dao-re", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32620347-a-promise-to-kill", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39988850-a-promise-to-kill", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23366077-to-hell-with-dante"]}
