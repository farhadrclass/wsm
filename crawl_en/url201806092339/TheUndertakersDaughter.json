I found it hard to pull myself away from the many 'varieties' of stories taking place within these pages. Can you imagine what your childhood might have been like had 'you' been born into a family death business? What questions might you ask your parents? What might you try to hide? How to handle jokes by other children at school? Kate vividly conjures up the Mayfield family household....Father, Mother, and siblings Evelyn, Thomas, and Jemma The Mayfield family try to live a normal life. The parents have community friends over for poker nights, creating a jovial atmosphere in spite of all the morning and death. The family considers themselves part of the town community. Their business is open 7 days a week. The drawbacks is a sense of confinement -- but mostly their father is very proud of the business he runs. He's a proud man ---with a quiet drinking problem. Evelyn, Kate's older sister, had an underlying mental disorder diagnosis. Growing up, Evelyn had mood swings --but no one in the town of Jubiliee used those words. People might say retarded --but in the Mayfield family -- Evelyn's behavior was just buried and ignored.Towards the end of the book, a scene takes place between 'Evelyn, Kate, and the younger sister Jemma, which is a gripping & haunting. Political community problems soar in Jubilee when the Mayfield family inherits an Historical Mansion. Between the youth, the majority of black people agree that crossing the color line is wrong -sinful. When Kate falls for a black boy -- trouble is in the air. Reading about Kate growing up during the 60's and 70's, with the challenges she faced within her family, her peers, the larger community, and the political times --has been memorable. I had a great laugh when Kate talked about the 70's. I, too, could have done without bell bottoms, and \"The Mod Squad\". A very entertaining -'educational' (death business) --life experience book!"}, {"userName": "\u262eKaren", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1076079-karen", "userReview": "The Undertaker's Daughter is the author Kate Mayfield, and we first meet her as a little girl. She lives with her siblings and parents above the funeral home that her father Frank owns in Jubilee, Kentucky; and these are her memories of what that was like for her-- socially, psychologically, emotionally. I was particularly drawn to this true story because in the same era as this book takes place, the 60s and 70s, my mother and I had friends who lived above a funeral home. I always felt both excited and a little creeped out whenever we visited their upstairs living quarters. Some of the Mayfields' friends felt the same way.Mayfield has a gift for storytelling. What I enjoyed most were her younger years. With echoes of Harper Lee's Scout, she narrates how once her father drove her in the ambulance for chocolate meringue pie, how one bite sent her spinning on her stool until she was dizzy. Then it was off on an ambulance call to an old teacher who had fallen. By keeping quiet and collected during the transport, she passed her father's etiquette test for emergencies--and anytime she pleased Frank, that was a very good thing.The story starts out sweet and a delight to read. Then it gets sad and perhaps sidetracked with segregation, mental illness, alcoholism, lawsuits--and I felt a change in the tone and the style, from an endearing Southern coming of age yarn to a loosely woven hodgepodge for a few of the chapters. It's such a downer when a book starts out remarkably and then loses some of its lustre as it progresses. I thought the Epilogue tied things up nicely, though. Mayfield had some answers finally to the perplexities of her family, and emphasized how important the father-daughter relationship was to her. Many thanks to NetGalley and the publisher."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5837456-susan", "userReview": "This memoir tells of Kate Mayfield\u2019s life in a small Southern town in the Sixties. Jubilee, Kentucky was still, to all intents and purposes, a segregated town when Frank Mayfield moved his family there and set up his new business. Mother Lily Tate longed for acceptance and a fresh start in her marriage. For, like all families, the Mayfield\u2019s had secrets. Father Frank was a dandy; a flirtatious and sociable man, who led grieving families through funeral arrangements with respect and care. His liking for the ladies and the mental health of older sister, Evelyn, were known by Kate, and cast a shadow over her life; but they were issues not faced until she was much older than the child she is when we first meet her.Although this book is set in an undertaker\u2019s, it is certainly not dour or depressing. However, when the words, \u201cwe\u2019ve got a body,\u201d were spoken by Kate\u2019s mother, she knew that the family had to be silent and out of sight. There could be no music, no playing, not even cooking smells wafting downstairs, when grieving relatives visited. Kate\u2019s father acted as an ambulance driver, as well as an undertaker, and this is a tale \u2013 not only of his relationship with Kate and his occupation \u2013 but also of small town politics; some of them ugly indeed. There is local family clannish mentality, which means that Frank\u2019s business is constantly taken by his competitor, Alfred Deboe. There are ugly rumours about Frank and his ally, the reclusive and elderly, Miss Agnes. There is also racism, which is taken almost for granted and which Kate inadvertently confronts by her attraction to a young boy at school. Indeed, you cannot blame Kate for her longing to break out of this small town mentality and leaving Jubilee behind. What always pulls her in two directions is her relationship with her father, which remains strong through everything. I found this a very interesting picture of a family and of Kate\u2019s gradual acceptance of her father\u2019s profession. She goes from resentment to embarrassment to respect, as she comes to understand what her father\u2019s work entails. A teacher, who looks down upon Kate, needs Frank\u2019s services and their relationship suddenly changes. Death visits us all and, despite some people not wishing to think about it, the inhabitants of Jubilee are grateful for his care and attention. The relationship between Kate and her father is central to the book and she tells their story well. Also, at the end of most chapters are a section called, \u201cIn Memoriam,\u201d which details some death in the community \u2013 be it the drowning of a girl in Kate\u2019s class or the murder of a local family by a father, and gives a sense of the inhabitants of Jubilee. Lastly, I received a copy of this book from the publisher, via NetGalley, for review."}, {"userName": "Shelleyrae at Book'd Out", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1607230-shelleyrae-at-book-d-out", "userReview": "The Undertaker's Daughter is a memoir by Kate Mayfield whose family owned and operated a funeral home in Jubilee, a small town on the border of Kentucky and Tennessee, from the 1960's to the late 1970's. Kate and her family, her parents Lily and Frank and siblings Thomas, Evelyn and Jemma, lived above the business, housed on the ground floor of their home. As a young child Kate had the run of the place, though she was required to tiptoe around their quarters when a body was in residence. In the first few chapters, she shares her charming curiosity about the deceased that passed through the home, uncomplicated by a fear of death and social disapproval. As Kate grows up, the memoir's focus shifts to the town and her family, though the undertaking business remains relevant. She details the small town politics the family had to contend with, and touches on the issues of segregation and desegregation, through her friendship with the family's housekeeper, Belle, and her own clandestine relationships with two African American boys as a teen. With regards to her family, Kate reveals her sister's mental illness but is especially focused on her relationship with her father, a complicated man she worshiped as a child, but who lost some of his lustre when Kate eventually learned of the secrets he kept as a serial adulterer and secret drinker.Well written, The Undertaker's Daughter is a charming and poignant memoir exploring one woman's experience of life and death in a small southern town."}, {"userName": "Rebecca Foster", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca-foster", "userReview": "Mayfield\u2019s father ran one of the three funeral homes in the small town of Jubilee, Kentucky in the 1960s and 70s. \u201cI wondered why my father chose to wake up every morning to take care of dead people.\u201d Mayfield only discovered after his death that he\u2019d come back from World War II service with PTSD; this, combined with his brother\u2019s death in the war, influenced his decision to become an undertaker. He was a consummate professional and a natty dresser, but also a womanizing alcoholic; Mayfield fosters sympathy for him through her balanced portrayal.The reality of processing dead bodies in one\u2019s home was often gruesome, especially when a local man shot his wife and children and then himself. Mayfield and her three siblings (including a bipolar sister) had to be quiet and sit at the top of the stairs whenever business came in. The family traveled in the ambulance/hearse as a matter of course. Everyone knew when they were coming; while some found it reassuring, others didn\u2019t like such an obvious memento mori.I was interested in the firsthand look at the funeral business and the everyday details about this Southern town, but not so much in the personal stuff about Kate herself, such as her scandalous interracial dating. (The Miss Agnes material, especially, bored me stiff.) My preference was for the cozy, generic descriptions of a small town\u2019s machinations: the increasingly bitter rivalry with another local funeral business, their housekeeper Belle\u2019s black dialect, bridge games, getting pie at the coffee counter, and so on. I especially liked the account of an enthusiastic eulogy \u2013 \u201cWe had an awful lot of God in our town. Jubilee had more churches than it knew what to do with.\u201dThis memoir is written very much like a novel; you can certainly see why it has drawn comparisons to The Help. The recreated dialogue is skillful and enthusiastic, yet I was always aware that Mayfield couldn\u2019t possibly have remembered any of it, and some of it is in a too-obvious father-daughter Q&A format to convey information about her father\u2019s work.

Out of the 60 odd books I've read this year, I think might only be my second non-fiction book. I was persuaded to read this for my bookclub, demonstrating for me the benefit of a bookclub as I never would have picked this up otherwise. This is they story of Kate Mayfield, who grew up in a small town in America's south during the 1960's as the daughter of an undertaker. The various blurb's I've seen for this book referrence Six Feet Under, My Girl, The Help and To Kill a Mockingbird. I can understand why. They are the cultural reference points for storys about undertakers, or life in America's south prior to the Civil Rights movement. However for me the fact Kate Mayfields father was an undertaker or that she is living through a tumultuous period in America's history are sidenotes to the real story. For me this is a book about a family, struggling with many aspects of life, and the host of interesting characters to enter their life. It is a book of discovery, about coming to the realisation that our parents are not perfect....they are fallible...they are human. Like may biographical books, it is a book in which little outside the normal run of life happens. People are born, people die, people fight and people make up. Yet is a compelling read. Mayfield's style draws us in. She is funny and touching in equal measure. This is a strong contender for one of my favourite books of the year."}, {"userName": "Carmen Blankenship ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5586759-carmen-blankenship", "userReview": "The Undertaker's Daughter is a well written memoir of growing up in the small Southern town of Jubelee as much as it is about growing up in a Funeral home. The reason the memoir works is because I really liked Kate. For some reason I kept comparing her to Veda from the movie My Girl. She is a spunky girl growing up during a tough time for the South and to make it more challenging, she is raised around the ceremony of death. While it may seem morbid it really was enlightening to here about the pride her father took in a person's final send off. As I stated before, this memoir is so much deeper than that. I enjoyed every second of this book. Some memoirs can get boring but then I remember that what I'm reading is someone's real life experiences and it shifts the way I'm thinking as reading the story. I'd definitely recommend.

Many will probably be ordinary, live normal everyday, 9 to 5 lives without really thinking about it all. But what if you were different, what if you were the daughter of an Undertaker, growing up in a funeral home during the late 50's, through the 60's and in to the 70's. It would be interesting in the least to say. But that was the life for Kate Mayfield as she takes us through the fascinating moments of her life, and even the secrets she probably thought she would never tell. In the Undertakers Daughter, we get transported back to Kate's young life, of sharing her home with the dead and the memory of her father and that of living in a small town in America where everyone knew everyone and everyone knew what was going on. We get taking from the moment her father answers the phone, through to the friendship's she made and kept secret and to the friendship her father had with the red lady. We follow through her childhood and teenage years, the fights with her sisters and parents, to the moment where she leaves for college and on through to her adult life.The Undertakers Daughter is filled with suspenseful moments and moments where you just grip the book to stop yourself from crying along with the characters. When I first picked the book up, I never really understood what it was about and it was left on my bookshelf for a long time before I finally picked it up and realize that it was a memoir. It moved me greatly as I read it and really would recommend it to anyone who asked.The part which moved me the most was the very ending, the last paragraph of her story. 'He could have chosen to declare the funeral home off-limits to my childhood. But he didn't. How fortunate I was that he allowed me to follow him downstairs each day to occupy his world. He welcomed me with open arms to an environment where I learned to explore, observe, and us my imagination in the midst of death. What a generous gift it was. For when it was time to leave Jubilee, I did so with relish, wide eyes, and an eagerness to test the thumping breast of life. For that, I will always be grateful.

Her family life is definitely not ordinary and you feel for her as she tries to navigate within her familial dysfunction, her unique living situation and life in small town (sometimes small minded) Kentucky.This book had some great moments and some 'just okay' moments for me. I enjoyed the author's voice and had to keep reminding myself that this was a memoir because it read much more like a fictional read and definitely had a 'stranger than fiction' feel to it. And although it did tend to drag a bit in the beginning for me, the pace picked up towards the end climaxing with a very distressing scene between two of the characters.There's a lot going on in this book besides life in a funeral home (which if I'm being honest took a back seat to other story lines the older Kate got). It dealt with segregation, alcoholism, mental illness, death and even a lawsuit. The reader also gets a peek at some of the unique services that the undertakers of the time offered.The book blurb describes this book as a cross between The Help and Six Feet Under but to me the association with The Help was a little weak. I had expected a lot more on that topic but got much more about the inner workings of a funeral home and the antics of the townspeople which were interesting but not what I had expected to read.In the end this book focused on a tumultuous and dysfunctional family with many secrets. The characters were unique and I liked getting a unique look at what life was like for Mayfield as she struggled to come to terms with her changing view of her father, her town's restrictive view of race and her very tumultuous relationship with her older sister. While this is not a light-hearted read it did ooze Southern charm and I enjoyed getting a view into Mayfield's unique life and struggles.My Rating: 3/5 stars** This book review, as well as hundreds more, can also be found on my blog, The Baking Bookworm (www.thebakingbookworm.blogspot.ca) where I also share my favourite recipes. **"}, {"userName": "Rumeur", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14015063-rumeur", "userReview": "Wonderfully written, delightfully descriptive & a \"Must Read\"!This is a memoir told through the experiences of one of Frank Mayfield's daughters, as she grew through the years living above Mayfield & Son Funeral Home in a small town of Kentucky named JubileeThe time period is mainly the 60's & 70's where Kate is enamored with most aspects of her father's business.

Graphic and children's reviews on the blog typically feature two or three images from the book's interior, which are not reproduced here.Note that I don't really do stars. To me a book is either worth reading or it isn't. I can't rate it three-fifths worth reading! The only reason I've relented and started putting stars up there is to credit the good ones, which were being unfairly uncredited. So, all you'll ever see from me is a five-star or a one-star (since no stars isn't a rating, unfortunately).I rated this book WORTHY!WARNING! MAY CONTAIN UNHIDDEN SPOILERS! PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK!Though the title sounds like one of those pretentious 'literary' works of fiction that medal mills love to lavish their trinkets upon, or perhaps the title of an Audrey Niffeneggar novel, unlike most of my reviews, this isn\u2019t one of a fictional work. You could make a decent argument here that the author is subsuming herself under her father in titling it the way she does: making herself a sub-unit of her father rather than her own person. But the author gets to name their novel, so this is her choice - unless Big publishing\u2122 stepped in and wrenched even those reins from her.Talking of which, the names have been changed, as they say, in this story, but it is a true story of one woman's upbringing in a funeral home in the sixties and seventies. She was the first person in her family to be carried from the hospital where she had recently been born, directly into a funeral home - where her family lived, and where her life effectively and paradoxically began!Once the family had moved to a new residence, where her father opened his own funeral parlor on the ground floor of his own home, life became interesting. Her father operated both the funeral home and an ambulance service - not unusual in those days - and they had multiple telephones; they could not afford to disrespectfully miss an important call about someone's dear departed or about someone who needed urgent delivery to the hospital.It was just as well he didn't ignore the call from a mother-to-be, alone and about to give birth, on a day when the snowy weather was so atrocious that not even the police wouldn't respond! That was the day the undertaker not only made it out there to the house, but learned how to deliver a baby in a hearse, when the child decided it didn't want to wait for the hospital.There were strict rules in place for conduct in the funeral home. When the funeral was in progress, life upstairs almost went into hibernation: the phones were muted, cooking was carefully monitored to avoid strong smells which might permeate downstairs, movement was reduced to tip-toeing, and conversation trimmed to a whisper, with TV and radio turned off.The author had a rather strict upbringing, especially by modern standards, and her mother's intransigence and disciplinarian attitude eventually forced her into her spending more and more of her time in her father's funereal domain. It's strange to think of it like that, isn't it: to think that an environment can be so unappealing to you that you'd rather be in a funeral home?!On that score, humor isn\u2019t absent from this story. There are endless stories to be enjoyed here, and there's a sly (and occasionally not so sly) vein of humor running through them. The tone of the novel is perky and vibrant throughout. Curious asides about \"the Egg Man\" (long before The Beatles sang it!) and interesting phrases like \"enough hairspray to kill a cat\" abound making this a really engaging and interesting read.The humor is matched equally with sadness, not just from the upset of people dying who were known to the family, and young children dying who were known personally to the author. There's also racism and the desegregation that really wasn't. On top of all that, there's a rivalry between her father's funeral services and those of the other guy in town. Note that this was not the guy who took care of black funerals, with whom her father got along famously, if secretly. No, this was rivalry with the guy who had the ear of the hospital's director, and some rich businessmen who had financial interests in burials for one reason or another.Overall, I really enjoyed reading this. This book is very different form my usual fare, and it;s probably because of that that i enjoyed it so. I recommend this book as a good read, a trip through history, and a very personal account of life in the sixties and seventies."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10135806-sara", "userReview": "The Undertaker's Daughter seems to be another one of those books that I just didn't quite get, as it seems that my opinion is greatly different from that of everybody else. At the time of writing my review, the book has a solid 4-star average, with nearly everybody making glowing comments on the lovely writing style, the depth of the characters, the riveting plot, and how difficult it was to put this book down. It's been awhile since I felt so differently from the majority of people. To put it simply, I really did not enjoy this one.Kate Mayfield was raised by an undertaker and took part in the day-to-day activities of the funeral home. In her memoir, she reflects on coming of age in 1960's Kentucky, a time when it was still racially segregated and women were not valued. The book has been compared to The Help, which I loved -- but aside from the setting, I can't find any similarities.Our narrator, who strangely never refers to herself by name within the book, is often offensive in her descriptions of her family, particularly her sister Evelyn. Evelyn is branded as the villain from the very beginning, while Mayfield's other siblings are practically saints. She drops hints throughout (and finally reveals at the end) that Evelyn is mentally ill, but there is no compassion or understanding directed at her. At one point, Mayfield states:Many days the daunting task of waking Evelyn in the morning fell to me. Oh, what a joyous task it was. Even in her sleep my sister looked angry, unsettled. It was the only time I could comfortably watch her without her snapping, \"What are you looking at?\"My first question is to why the author feels the need to watch her sister so often, particularly while she's sleeping. I know that I get a little cranky when people stare at me -- I think this is a common feeling, and I wonder why she's writing it as though it's strange. My second question relates to how she would feel if Evelyn had written a nasty memoir about her. Did she wonder how Evelyn would feel if she read this book? She's taken the story of her sister's untreated mental illness and written it as though Evelyn chose to behave this way. Has Evelyn now received proper treatment? Everybody's story is wrapped up at the end, but what became of Evelyn is still somewhat of a mystery.The plot is often unfocused, as Mayfield begins telling one story only to get sidetracked by some minor happening. She leaves out many key details, often including her age, making the timeline extremely confusing. The way she writes herself as a young child is the same as she writes herself as a teenager and also a young adult. Her language and thoughts never evolve to give the reader a sense that she's getting older, unless you count her developing romantic feelings. The writing overall is clumsy, as evidenced in the following passages:Grabbing hold of a tuft of hair, she furiously teased it with her special teasing comb that if I touched I died.The new magnet to his groin worked in one of the church's offices.The thing that most frustrates me in a memoir is an average person believing they've lived an exceptional life. In the case of The Undertaker's Daughter, I felt like nothing particularly exceptional happened to our narrator. Or perhaps it did and she didn't communicate it well. Her father was an undertaker, yes, but she reveals that there were multiple undertakers in her town, as I'm sure was common in this time period. Her father was a close friend of Miss Agnes, the wealthiest woman in town, but this is hardly relevant to the story. The most that happens is her father inheriting a mansion and having some legal trouble with Miss Agnes' family. Mayfield reveals being deeply attracted to multiple African American boys in her class, going so far as to date them in a time of segregation. This was possibly the most interesting thing that happened in the book, and still it felt like it was just there so that Mayfield could feel good about herself for being ahead of the times.It took me six days to read the first 150 or so pages, and I skimmed the remainder of the book. It didn't catch my attention whatsoever, and I felt that large chunks needed to be removed or heavily edited. Again, as I said at the beginning of my review, my feelings are the polar opposite of most of what I've seen about this book, so maybe I'm just missing something. You might really enjoy it, as many people have.Thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for the free copy.[find more reviews at the bibliophagist]"}, {"userName": "Bruce Gargoyle", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22648121-bruce-gargoyle", "userReview": "Full review at http://thebookshelfgargoyle.wordpress...

On reflection, this is quite a broad memoir that not only takes in the specifics of living in a funeral home, but also encompasses the author\u2019s learnings from watching her father\u2019s interactions with various people in their town. There are big chunks of the book dedicated to Kate and her father\u2019s relationship with a reclusive, wealthy lady resident of the town and the resulting friction that occurs between her family and the townsfolk after the lady\u2019s eventual death. There\u2019s quite a bit about the volatile social climate around race in the post-segregation era as told through Kate\u2019s experiences with friendship and dating as a young teen. There\u2019s an awful lot about Kate\u2019s family struggles as she learns more about her father\u2019s less-than-stellar behaviour and deals with her elder sister\u2019s untreated mental illness.So if you have an interest in that time period and its impact on the relationships between different groups in a small town, there will be a lot of extra bang for your buck if you pick up this book. For me though, while some of those bits were reasonably interesting, I really just wanted to find out more about living in a funeral home. By the time Kate gets to be a young teen, the funeral home bit of the memoir is pretty much wrapped up and the rest of the book focuses on Kate\u2019s emerging social awareness, before relating her family\u2019s experiences in dealing with her father\u2019s death.Overall, I suspect this wasn\u2019t really ever going to be the book for me. It\u2019s in no way a bad book \u2013 it\u2019s very readable, and as I said, got plenty to draw in the person with an interest in memoirs that focus on social history \u2013 it just wasn\u2019t quite what I was expecting."}, {"userName": "Paul Pessolano", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4877713-paul-pessolano", "userReview": "\u201cThe Undertaker\u2019s Daughter\u201d by Kate Mayfield, published by Gallery Books.Category \u2013 Memoir Publication Date \u2013 January 131, 2015I went to school with a girl whose father was an undertaker and she lived above the funeral parlor. I often wondered how she could live there sleeping above dead people, for me it had to be creepy and scary.Kate Mayfield\u2019s father was an undertaker and her family lived above the funeral home. Kate not only lived above the funeral home but she took an active part in its operation, well lets say that she had an inquisitive mind. She often questioned her father on what he was doing, although she refused to observe an embalming procedure. They lived in the small town of Jubilee, Kentucky which was very segregated and where everyone knew everyone\u2019s business. Kate tells of several people her father embalmed and their lives. The most telling is the story of Ms. Agnes, a woman who was a little on the eccentric side but became a good friend of her father. In fact, when she died she bequeathed her historic home and all of its contents to him. Kate was a little on the wild side, often challenging the social acceptance of the time, including segregation. She went against her parent\u2019s desire for her Major in college and could not wait until she could leave the town of Jubilee. She accomplishes this only after her father\u2019s death at an early age. She also discovers several things concerning her father, that although he was a loving father and provider for his family he was also a lady\u2019s man and an alcoholic.The final chapter brings her back to Jubilee where she discovers that her life above the funeral home was in fact preparing her for her future life.A very interesting and different memoir that is not only entertaining but a look at society in a small close knit community."}, {"userName": "Brooke", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6775105-brooke", "userReview": "My review is going to be the polar opposite to many of those already available to read. I don\u2019t wonder if I missed the point as I don\u2019t know there was much of a point to be made.This book is strangely unsettling and not simply because Mayfield was raised in a funeral home. What unnerved me was the way she wrote about her family. Mayfield is very open when describing her relationship with her parents and her sisters and this is to be expected in a memoir, however, there came a point, a point I can\u2019t put my finger on, when this moved into the realm of expose and tabloidism. The other part of this that made me uncomfortable was the writing style. In creating a memoir that reads as fiction, it raised the question of how much of this am I supposed to believe? If I wrote a book in this style my family would string me up. I can guarantee you, I would be disowned. Obviously, every family dynamic is different but the style doesn\u2019t sit well with me. Some reviewers have arguably felt the same as me when they write Mayfield\u2019s work reminds them of Harper Lee \u2018s To Kill A Mockingbird. They recognise the fictional overtones but ignore the dishonesty. To see how many other fictional books The Undertaker\u2019s Daughter is likened to is a worry for me because it really does spark an element of mistrust.Full Review - https://goo.gl/scFO3i"}, {"userName": "Victoria (RedsCat)", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4458260-victoria-redscat", "userReview": "Funeral homes have always been fascinating to me. In the small-town where I grew up, I especially remember the one (it might have been the only one) which had the beautiful fountain in front. It seems that every few months someone put dish soap in the fountain so it would bubble and sparkle. And I was completely amazed that a family actually lived in the funeral home. But I didn't know them, and I didn't know what it was like to live there.In Kate Mayfield's memoir, I get an idea of what that was like. She describes growing up there in a forthright manner: what the business was like (cut-throat competition!), what the process is like (from picking up the bodies through the funeral service), and what it's like to be living among the dead. The memoir is always respectful and completely interesting. And it's about more than the funeral side of things. It's about growing up fiercely independent in a town full of small-minded people, in an era of repression and oppression. It's about growing up with a voracious love of reading, a father with too many secrets, and an angry and abusive sister. This is a beautifully told and eye-opening memoir, with respect for the living and the dead.(Many thanks to Gallery/Threshold & NetGalley!)"}, {"userName": "Ionia", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16434239-ionia", "userReview": "This is a lot more interesting than your standard memoir. This book reads easily and at times more like a novel than an account of a person's own life experiences. I liked the honest way the author approached this. I could imagine myself as a child, being told to be quiet all the time and trying to obey the rules--finding it nearly impossible and could sympathise with the author. Growing up in a home where the family business is also conducted is hard on a child. As this book progressed, I felt as though the author was someone I knew well and her story touched my heart. This is the kind of memoir that stays with you, as you see or do something days after finishing it and think about some part of the book--some experience the author described and it makes you smile to realise you have made a connection with someone you have never met because of their writing. Even if you aren't a fan of the memoir in itself, you should give this one a try. I really enjoyed it. This review is based on a complimentary copy from the publisher and provided through Netgalley.

I am usually a bit apprehensive about memoirs because I find that they can often be self-indulgent or otherwise amount to the mechanical recitation of a series of events. But I really enjoyed this book -- as much as a good novel. Mayfield recounts the first 20 years or so of her life in a small town in Kentucky. It is as much a story of Mayfield's own life as the daughter of an undertaker growing up in a funeral home as it is a story about the southern US in the 60's and 70's. In a way, Mayfield's story is the conventional story of a girl who discovers that her beloved father is not as perfect as she thought and can't wait to leave the stifling environment she lives in. But the details of the setting and Mayfield's strong personality which comes through in her confident narrative style made for a very engaging read that was hard to put down. Highly recommended!"}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9936139-kelly", "userReview": "Many thanks to NetGalley and Gallery, Threshold Pocket Books for a copy of this book to review in exchange for an honest opinion.This lovely memoir is the story of Kate Mayfield, daughter of an undertaker in Jubilee, Kentucky in the 1960's and 1970's. It paints a vivid picture of the interesting life of a young girl living in a funeral home. It also covers so much more than that. The book delves into so many other topics; race relations in the South, mental illness, PTSD from WWII, adultery, and alcoholism. This book is extremely well written and reads easily like a novel. I found the small town of Jubilee and it's characters to be so interesting. The relationship of Kate with her father is fascintating. We see her go from idolizing him and his extreme care in dealing with the dead and their families to realizing that he was a man with flaws and many secrets.

I found it very difficult to put down and found that it was quite well written. The combination of eccentric characters were thought provoking and at times inspirational.There are, however, some reasons why I could not give this book five stars. The first reason is because of the depth when it came to certain aspects of the process of preparing the bodies for the funerals. The lead character seemed to be very interested at times in her father's work yet when he chose to explain it in detail she backed out and didn't want to know anymore...often to do with her feeling uncomfortable. This was a little frustrating as admittedly I wanted to know all of the details. The second reason is the distance created between the lead character, Kate, and the reader. After I had finished the book I had to look at the front of the book to read the author's name as I couldn't remember it. Kate is not called or mentioned by her name within the book, this for me created a distance. The third and final reason is the lack of ages being mentioned. Time often moved back and forwards within the book telling us about different times in Kate's life, but it didn't give us her age. There were times when I just thought...so when did that happen? How old was she? How old were her sisters when that happened? This led to some of the back stories being a bit muddled and unclear but they were still very interesting to read."}, {"userName": "Laurie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13496920-laurie", "userReview": "I'm going to give this an enthusiastic 3.8 stars, because I didn't think it was as good as the 4 star books I've rated. One reason is that it took me quite a while to feel much enthusiasm for what I was reading. When I eventually did, my reading took off! My favorite parts were hearing about the racial taboos in the south at that time. The author is several years older than I, but I was still jarred by the differences between the south and where I grew up, and I was secretly thrilled for her and her two boyfriends each time they were able to be together. Some parts of her story weren't very interesting to me, and I wanted to know more about things she gave little attention to. Her writing style was nice, and I enjoyed the spots of humor.

I really loved the first half. It was interesting to read about the author growing up in a funeral home, particularly as it takes place in my home state of Kentucky.The first half was what I expected it to be: about growing up in a funeral home in a small Southern town during the 50s-60s. The author was an entertaining child who didn't shy away from the more macabre aspects of the funeral home. I enjoyed reading about the different ways people deal with grief, as well as the interesting people in her town, such as Belle and Miss Agnes. I also loved the view into the unfortunate racism of the time. I was practically spitting with rage while reading the part where her preacher was abusing scripture to try to support racial purity. It's bad enough that anyone would support such a position, but to twist the word of God to do so? Enraging.However, near the middle, the book seemed to become a completely different book entirely. There were parts that didn't seem to fit with the premise of the book, and it became less about the funeral business and more about the author's own sexual awakening (at a tender 14, no less!), her father's infidelity, and her sister's mental disorder.I wouldn't have minded some of that, like her sister's untreated bipolar disorder, except it seemed out of sync with the first part of the book. I think this wouldn't have bothered me SO much if the book had been marketed better. My impression of the book going into it was that it would focus on the living in a funeral home aspect, as well as the social issues of the time, and the ups and downs of living in a small town. However, that's really just the first half of the book, and the author portrays Jubilee (the setting) as having NO redeeming qualities.So, while I found the first part of the book hard to put down, I had to force myself to get through the second half and finish the book. Really, I feel like 3 stars is being generous at this point, and I may drop it lower on further reflection.EDIT: Reading through some other reviews I just remembered a portion of the book that I must have tried to block from my memory because I forgot about it when writing my original review. The portion about a teacher at Mayfield's school who was allowed to take advantage of the girls in his class. It was so disturbing and completely out of place with the rest of the book. I get that it's a memoir, but there didn't seem to be a point to the section at all. There was no encouragement from the author for anyone in a similar situation to report such behavior. Maybe the author didn't want to be preachy, but so many girls in her class were hurt because none of them reported his behavior. Even now, years later, her tone indicated that she didn't really care what happened to those other girls, or girls in future classes, just as long as she was able to escape it. The passage was wholly unsettling, and worse, there didn't seem to be a point. I'm almost tempted to drop the book down to 1 star just for this section."}], "description": "What if the place you called 'home' happened to be a funeral home? Kate Mayfield explores what it meant to be the daughter of a small-town undertaker in this fascinating memoir evocative of Six Feet Under and The Help, with a hint of Mary Roach's Stiff.The first time I touched a dead person, I was too short to reach into the casket, so my father picked me up and I leaned in for that first, empty, cold touch. It was thrilling, because it was an unthinkable act.After Kate Mayfield was born, she was taken directly to a funeral home. Her father was an undertaker, and for thirteen years the family resided in a place nearly synonymous with death. A place where the living and the dead entered their house like a vapor. The place where Kate would spend the entirety of her childhood. In a memoir that reads like a Harper Lee novel, Mayfield draws the reader into a world of Southern mystique and ghosts.Kate's father set up shop in a small town where he was one of two white morticians during the turbulent 1960s. Jubilee, Kentucky, was a segregated, god-fearing community where no one kept secrets, except the ones they were buried with. By opening a funeral home, Kate's father also opened the door to family feuds, fetishes, and victims of accidents, murder, and suicide. The family saw it all. They also saw the quiet ruin of Kate's father, who hid alcoholism and infidelity behind a cool, charismatic exterior. As Mayfield grows from trusting child to rebellious teen, she begins to find the enforced hush of the funeral home oppressive, and longs for the day she can escape the confines of her small town.In The Undertaker's Daughter, Kate has written a triumph of a memoir.
