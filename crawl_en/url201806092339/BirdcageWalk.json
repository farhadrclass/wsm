Her gift for human observation and the ability to show the horrors of history are picked out.Sadly I reached then end of this novel and shrugged my shoulders. True it was very well written, convincingly evoking the time and place of Bristol in the late 1700s, but the story lacked the depth and interest to really make me enthusiastic. The cover talks about \"...a novel about terror and resistance set in a time of political chaos and personal tragedy.\" I think this gives a false impression, because although the novel is set at the time of the French Revolution, I don't feel the threat from the events in France really making a difference to everyday life in Bristol. Reading about events in the newspaper just doesn't make me feel the terror of what was happening there. Yes the impact means that Diner Tredevant, one of the central characters, will lose his livelihood building houses for the wealthy, but we feel little sympathy for him anyway. As I say, it is a well written book, but in the end it is too sanitised of passion and emotion to work for me."}, {"userName": "Amalia Gavea", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56789747-amalia-gavea", "userReview": "\u2018\u2019Who would look at this place and desire it?\u2019\u2019\n\u2018\u2019The Siege\u2019\u2019 by Helen Dunmore was one of the very first books I read in English, when I was 18. Since then, she has become one of the authors whose work I closely follow. Her stories are raw, with a distinctive kind of beauty, sometimes full of a kind of discomforting honesty as in the case of \u2018\u2019Talking to the Dead\u2019\u2019. In \u2018\u2019Birdcage Walk\u2019\u2019, she provides one more excellent example of Historical Fiction.The original Birdcage Walk is a famous street in Westminster, in London, but here, Dunmore transfers it to Bristol. We find ourselves in 1792, in an era of violence, of political and social turmoil caused by the aftermath of the French Revolution. Our main character is a young woman named Lizzie Fawkes who was born to a mother of radical intellectual beliefs. This creates significant problems to her marriage with John Diner Tredevant whose conservative convictions and worries about the major difficulties caused in his job by the turbulent times, along with a dark secret of his past compose a suffocating environment for Lizzie.I\u2019ve always found the era of the French Revolution magnetizing and I haven't had the chance to read a great number of novels dealing with its impact on other European countries. In \u2018\u2019Birdcage Walk\u2019\u2019, the consequences of the Revolution and the beginning of the Reign of Terror blend in the narration in a coherent, beautiful way. We witness the spreading of the news in England, and the fear caused by the upheaval in the sovereign monarchy of the Albion. Not to mention, the dread of a possible war between the two countries. I was pleasantly surprised to see the assassination of Jean-Paul Marat and the trial of Charlotte Corday being included in the story,an event that continues to fascinate and attract much speculationSo,when you\u2019re dealing with such an important, rich historical period, there's always the risk that your plot and characters may be overshadowed. This isn't the case here. Without presenting a large cast of characters, Dunmore creates realistically problematic protagonists, people that you can love, hate and connect to.\n\u2018\u2019You speak too freely.\u2019\u2019\nThe focus is on Lizzie. She is clever, innocent, but fully aware of her surroundings and the traps that lay before her. She is a very earthly, very realistic character. A woman who tries to balance her love for her family and her feelings for her husband. Diner is, to put it simply, a despicable character.I may sound too harsh or dogmatic, but I hated him from the very first moment and my hatred grew with each page. He is cruel, cold, heartless. He wants to control Lizzie to the fullest. What she eats, whom she sees,where she goes, when she smiles, why she smiles, everything. He is a toxic, suffocating individual. It seemed to me that between him and Lizzie there was only a physical, sexual connection, dark and unhealthy. This is a man who\u2019s incapable of love of any kind.The secondary characters are very well-drawn and very interesting.Julia, Lizzie\u2019s mother, a woman who follows her convictions to the end, Hannah, the nurse, the rock of the household, Augustus, Lizzie\u2019s stepfather, sensitive and with his head in the clouds, Phillo,the stern but faithful young maid, and Will, a young, radical poet, a dreamer. However, the character that casts a long,dark shadow in the plot, is Lucie, Diner\u2019s first wife and the spectre that haunts Lizzie\u2019s mind and marriage.This brings me to the structure and the themes of the novel.There is the Prelude that I found so engaging.The story starts at a graveyard, following a middle-aged man and a striking discovery by his dog,The powerful presence of Death remains tangible during the first stages of the book, and the reader already begins to wonder. Does Dunmore give certain things away too early? Yes, she does and this adds to that gloomy, foreboding feeling of impending danger that shimmers constantly as the chapters fly. There is a distinctive echo of Du Maurier's \u2018\u2019Rebecca\u2019\u2019, the similarities are unmistakable as the first wife's shadow falls on Lizzie, the gloomy,haunting landscape that surrounds her, the dilapidated estate begging for an owner that slowly becomes a prison...Those who are already fans of Dunmore's writing are certain to enjoy \u2018\u2019Birdcage Walk\u2019\u2019. The ones who wish to familiarize themselves with her work will find a perfect introduction in this novel, and a powerful example of well-written Historical Fiction.Many thanks to Grove Atlantic for providing me with an ARC copy through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Bettie\u262f", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie", "userReview": "BABThttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08gxddhDescription:  Set in Bristol in 1792, Birdcage Walk is set against a backdrop of the French Revolution. It touches on Radical idealism, property, political turmoil and private tragedy. Inspired by the real life of Julia Fawkes, a leading Radical writer, none of whose work has survived, Dunmore explores the tensions between generations and genders, and examines the idea of legacy as Julia's daughter Lizzie finds herself torn between her charismatic, self made husband and her idealistic mother. As her husband Diner Tredevant speculates on property in Bristol's housing boom, he risks losing everything in the social upheaval caused by the French Revolution.An acclaimed poet and award-winning novelist, Helen Dunmore's work often explores the interplay between the public and the personal, most famously in The Siege and The Betrayal, and most recently Exposure.Hattie Morahan is a stage, film and TV actress who won numerous awards for her portrayal of Nora in the Young Vic production of A Doll's House. She was part of the cast of Outnumbered and recently appeared in BBC TVs My Mother and Other Strangers. Episode One: A mysterious burial. The story opens four years earlier as a man hides a body in a gorge. The death is unexplained but four years later, the man has a wife - Lizzie Fawkes. Lizzie visits her mother who is ill, and tells her of her husband's Diner's plans to build a magnificent new terrace overlooking the Gorge. It is to be the envy of the city but for Diner a huge financial risk.Lizzie's mother has shocking news which explains her sickness. And Lizzie and her property devloper husband Diner must display their house to prospective buyers.News from France threatens to destabilise Europe and the overthrow of the French king makes Diner anxious that it will upset the housing market and scare off potential buyers. Lizzie is preoccupied with the safe delivery of her mother's new baby.Lizzie has a new baby brother, but must confront a terrible loss. She is also unsettled by her husband's past, and the story of his husband's first wife - a French woman called Lucie. Lizzie is missing her mother dreadfully and troubled by Diner's behaviour. She goes to visit Hannah for her reassurance and has an unexpected encounter. News also come from France of the King's trail. Diner questions where Lizzie has been on her nocturnal wanderings, and a chance encounter with a dressmaker on the streets of Bristol reveals a clue to John Diner's past. Lizzie Fawkes decides to visit the dressmaker to find out more about Diner's first wife Lucie and the mysterious circumstances surrounding her death.The news from France darkens, and Lizzie receives a French visitor - but the visitor has not come to talk of the Revolution. Instead she is searching for Lizzie husband's Diner, and the whereabouts of his first wife's tombstone. Fear over the beheading of the King of France spreads to England and the housing market collapses. Diner faces financial ruin and Lizzie must face a frightening truth about her marriage. Lizzie is reunited with Thomas, but sees the scale of her husband's failure as his office is bare and his creditors come to the house shouting for their money. Diner is forced leave and he is determined that Lizzie will go with him. Diner is taking Lizzie to the far side of the Gorge to a secret place. It is here she must confront the truth about what actually happened to Diner's first wife."}, {"userName": "Phrynne", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne", "userReview": "A bit disappointed over this one. It had so much promise - a beautiful cover, the story built around very interesting historical facts, well written prose, a mysteriously dead wife, some initially intriguing characters. Sadly it just never seemed to go anywhere or if it did it was in such tiny increments I barely noticed. I kept reading in the hope of an exciting ending but it just fizzled out.Nevertheless the writing itself was very good indeed and I have been told the author wrote some much better books.

Lizzie married to a house builder Diner, who is so desirous of having a wife he can control, lead a life that seems dark and brooding. Lizzie worships her mother and at her death assumes responsibility for her mother's newborn son. All the characters tread a mysterious line and one finds that they seem to mistrust one another and possibly fear is evident. Each of the characters seem to be in a constant state of looking over one's shoulder as if they expect the guillotine to fall upon their necks even though they do not live in France.

This may sound like a bad thing, but actually I have nothing but admiration for that book. Ultimately this what any good author should hope to accomplish; books should above all seek to make an impression on you and it does not necessarily have to be in a way that makes you feel happy. A forgotten book is a failed book, in my opinion. However, Birdcage Walk was not moving or shocking like The Siege was and I wasn\u2019t emotionally invested in the story at all. The book claims to be set amidst the backdrop of the French Revolution, but this historical event is woefully underused. The French Revolution was one of the most dramatic events in history and permanently changed the mentality of Europe\u2019s monarchy, yet out of all the perspectives in Europe Dunmore could have chosen to focus on, she chooses the wife of a property developer in Bristol. The blurb talks about a story set amidst the terror of the Revolution but I didn\u2019t get a sense of any terror from the story itself. It never felt like a real threat to any of our characters so what was the point in even mentioning it in the first place? All it does it cause the property market to collapse and Elizabeth\u2019s husband to lose his investment, a plot that didn\u2019t exactly pique my interest in this tumultuous time in world history. It makes me wonder why Dunmore bothered setting the book during the French Revolution at all, if all she\u2019s going to do is have the odd character referring to a newspaper article on the latest execution. It had no impact on the overall plot whatsoever.That was the main problem with this book, to put it bluntly, it was too slow-paced and the plot was boring. Personally, I think this book was in desperate need of a good edit; the dialogue was repetitive and the conversations too long and full of uninteresting comments I couldn\u2019t care less about. If The Siege is an example of everything a good book should be, this is an example of everything it shouldn't.

Research had resulted with few if any details, save that Julia was an author read by many, and the wife of Augustus Gleeson, a noticeable pamphlet writer of the late 18th century, a time when the French revolution was in its height and the reports of the bloody streets of Paris inflamed the anti-Monarchy British intellectuals such as himself.When it was apparent that none of Julia\u2019s Writings have survived, Dunmore took it upon herself to revive the old pioneer English woman writer, maybe seeing much of herself in her imaginary character. The story takes place in late 18th century Bristol, when amidst the speculation about war with France, the real-estate market has collapsed \u2013 sending the economy, the entrepreneurs and many workers to chaotic desperation.The story (in Brief) is cleverly told by Lizzie Fawkes, now Mrs Tredevant, Julia\u2019s sole daughter. Having brought up in a liberal house, encouraged to act and think for herself, to be opinionated and never timid, Julia has broken from that suffocating shelter that her family provided to marry a speculate called John Diner, a widower who has made a small fortune by building houses and has now undertook a grandiose project of building the houses overlooking the Bristol Avon Gorge. As Lizzie discovers that not everything is as perfect as she had convinced herself, we learn about her husband\u2019s jealous character, his endeavours which are slowly but surely going bust, and Lizzy\u2019s warm relationship with her mother and Hannah (their servant and close friend from when she was an infant). The subplot is that of the French revolution, as perceived by random reports that make it in, whether by post or by newspapers, and how differently they are perceived by John Diner and by Augustus and his milieu.This is an historical fiction, but branding it as such does it little justice. Dunmore has managed to bring life into characters that existed (or some have) in real life, with such intensity that makes you forget yourself, all set into motion from a small script on a headstone!The shadow of Dunmore\u2019s disease must have entwined this novel in grimness that is leaping out of the pages \u2013 but give this novel the true colour of life in England and Europe in the 18-1900s. It is a masterpiece, and I dare say \u2013 Dunmore will be missed."}, {"userName": "Roman Clodia", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56111743-roman-clodia", "userReview": "\"You have nothing of your own. You are my wife. All that you have belongs to me. All that you are belongs to me.\"After a slightly slow and awkward start (a framing narrative in the present that simply disappears), this is a wonderfully gripping and intelligent read. On one level, not much actually happens; on another, we have an intimate portrait of Lizzy Fawkes who traverses marriage and a kind of quasi-motherhood, emerging stronger, perhaps more cynical, but also enlightened by the end. Set against a background of the French Revolution, the book juxtaposes questions of idealism vs. disillusionment and makes them play out on both a public and private stage. The revolution which is supposed to herald liberty, fraternity and universal suffrage (though, let's be clear, Tom Paine, an offstage character throughout, only applies human 'rights' to men, property owners, people of the 'correct' religion... but that's by the way and not in the book) descends into political rivalry, mass violence and unending bloodshed; while the idealising union of marriage also reveals its increasingly dark and menacing side.Lizzy Fawkes' mother and step-father reminded me of Mary Wollstonecraft and William Godwin, though Lizzy herself is no Mary Shelley. And one of the great strengths of the book is its refusal to offer up too patterned or neat a narrative. There are lots of 'issues' here (social equality, relations between men and women, marriage, love, violence, capitalism) but they feel natural and unforced, an intricate part of the story being told rather than hijacking the tale.Dunmore's writing is graceful throughout, restrained and unshowy but always precise and controlled. And there is humour here, too, at the 'champagne radical' who talks of social justice while looking down on the maids and only using the best candles...This isn't a long book but it is a rich one, with a grip that we don't always find in 'literary' fiction: 4.5 stars for a story which I gulped down in 2 sittings.

The main characters include the maternal, independent, supportive Lizzie and the jealous, iron-fisted, ruined Tredevant. And the\u00a0plot, although a little slow in the middle, is laced from start to finish with an underlying feeling of despair and a real, palpable bleakness as the ongoing drama, social strife, economic uncertainty, marital tension, and increasing violence unravels.I have to admit that even though Birdcage Walk is not my favourite novel by Dunmore, it is still a beautiful, haunting tale that highlights her talent of writing historical fiction that moves, informs, and leaves a lasting impression. The passing of Dunmore earlier this year is certainly a tremendous loss for the literary world and to quote from the inscription on the grave of her fictional character in this novel, \"Her Words Remain Our Inheritance.\"Thank you to PGC Books & Grove Atlantic for providing me with a copy in exchange for an honest review.All my reviews can be found on my blog at https://whatsbetterthanbooks.com"}, {"userName": "Gumble's Yard", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35482263-gumble-s-yard", "userReview": "Lizzie Fawkes is the daughter of Julia Fawkes a radical feminist writer (in a second marriage to a radical pamphleteer), Lizzie herself has (against her families wishes due to the conventionality of the marriage and of her partner) married John Diner Tredevant, a heavily leveraged property developer whose latest project is a terraced development in Clifton, Bristol above the Avon Gorge. The book takes place in the early years of the French revolution \u2013 as the revolution gets increasingly bloody, forcing the radicals around Julia to examine their own thoughts on the revolution, and the economic uncertainty caused by the prospect of war increasingly hampers Diner\u2019s attempts to sell his properties and expose the precariousness of his credit financed business model.The plot development in the book is limited and (just as in Exposure) much of it is revealed up front. In the first chapter we see a male character burying the body of a female in the woods near the river: all through the book we suspect who the two characters are. The first paragraph of the book tells us that the declaration of war in 1893 lead to a complete collapse in the Bristol house market and the bankruptcy of developers. Nevertheless (like Exposure) Dunmore by her use of atmosphere (weather is a key factor in the story), description of landscape (the heights around the gorge and the mysterious woods on the other side are almost another character in the book) and thoughts (the book is told almost entirely from Lizzie's first person viewpoint as she tries to understand Diner and gradually realises the truth about him, his business and her marriage) maintains the dramatic tension in the narrative.As Dunmore explicitly acknowledges in a very interesting afterword, one of the key themes to her writing, and what gives it its power, is her ability to tell of great historical events or upheavals from the point of view of those who are integral to events but whose voices have vanished or been marginalised from the historical record: the inhabitants of Leningrad under siege (The Siege); the family of Cold War spies (Exposure); Doctors caught in Stalin\u2019s purges (The Betrayal).Here she even more concentrates on \u201cthe ways in which an individual vanishes from the historical record\u201d, but the individual in this case (Lizzie\u2019s mother \u2013 Julia Fawkes) is largely absent from the novel, and even more so than with the figure of Cora Seaborne in The Essex Serpent one is left with a character so apparently compelling as to hold many of the other characters in her orbit (in this case even after her death \u2013 both via her writing and reputation and in Lizzie\u2019s case by way of ghostly visions) but whose fascination is less clear to the reader.Further the \u201cperiod of great political upheaval and social change\u201d behind the look largely centres around the events of the French Revolution and are too often told either by letters from acquaintances or even less revealingly by characters reading newspaper articles aloud to each other \u2013 in some ways then it feels like we are viewing the events one step removed and more in the way it could be experienced in a non-fiction historical record."}, {"userName": "Roger Brunyate", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42294189-roger-brunyate", "userReview": "Dunmore's SwansongHelen Dunmore died in June 2017; this was her last novel. Although it sums up many of the themes of her previous writing, I can't say that it is her most successful work, mainly because so little happens in it and, while its sense of place is unusually strong, its conflicts seem correspondingly diffuse. But a book that one knows must be one\u2019s last (as the author admits in an Afterword) develops an extra depth of interest.Many of Dunmore's novels take place under the shadow of war or other great events; her subjects are usually ordinary people caught up in its fringes. Zennor in Darkness and A Spell of Winter (see below for links) are both set in England during the First World War; in The Siege and The Betrayal, the setting is Leningrad during the Second World War and immediately after; the background to Exposure are the spy scares of the Cold War. Birdcage Walk takes her back even further, to the French Revolution. The novel, however, is not set in France, but in Dunmore's home city of Bristol; this is both its strength and its weakness.It is a strength in that the setting is a striking landscape that she really knows, the Avon Gorge where it plunges down to the river from the Bristol suburb of Clifton, half a century before the building of the great suspension bridge. John Diner Tredevant, her antihero, is a property developer who is building a terrace of fine houses on the hillside, offering unique views. But he is doing the work on borrowed money, and the events in France, with the attendant possibility of war, are scaring off potential investors. Dunmore paints a vivid picture of the excellent craftsmanship of the show house in which Diner Tredevant is living with his young wife Lizzie, surrounded by the shells of its unroofed neighbors. But she is even better in evoking the scenery of the downs at the edge of the gorge, still largely unchanged today:\nVery likely he had turned already and gone home, I told myself, but I did not believe it. He was a poet. If the wind howled and the rain drenched him, so much the better. He could scarcely hope for a thunderstorm at this time of the year, but he would go to the highest point where he might gaze outwards at the weather blowing in from the west against the chasm of the Gorge. He would want to see everything. He would watch the boats beating their way upriver, and the white posts that glimmered through the dusk, marking the towpath far below. He might catch sight of a peregrine folding its wings for a dive. He would stand and face the immensity of dark, leafless forest opposite. I followed the footpath, climbing swiftly as the rain blew in my face.\nDunmore's choice of setting is a weakness, however, in that there is very little connection between the people in her novel and the events in France. The characters in The Siege live and starve in Leningrad itself. DH Lawrence and his wife in Zennor in Darkness are suspected of being German spies. But the presiding genius of this novel, Lizzie's mother Julia Fawkes, is perfectly safe. A committed radical, she writes passionate pamphlets while her second husband (Lizzie's stepfather) goes around preaching equality. Both work far from London, let alone France. And we really glimpse Jean's political passion only as reflected by Lizzie, for whom radicalism has only a personal dimension, in terms of her individual freedom as a woman. Even Will Forrest, the poet in the quotation above, is imperilled only for his writing; his flight to some idyllic exile in the country make him into a romantic figure rather than a political one.At the same time, it is precisely the relative obscurity of Jean Fawkes that makes her so interesting to Dunmore. In a Prologue, written in a male voice, though I suspect it is autobiographical, she talks about walking in a disused graveyard, the Birdcage Walk of the title, coming upon Jean's tomb, and wondering. As she describes it later:\nThe question of what is left behind by a life haunts the novel. While I finished and edited it I was already seriously ill, but not yet aware of this. I suppose that a writer\u2019s creative self must have access to knowledge of which the conscious mind and the emotions are still ignorant, and that a novel written at such a time, under such a growing shadow, cannot help being full of a sharper light, rather as a landscape becomes brilliantly distinct in the last sunlight before a storm.\nIn all honesty, I did not sense that sharper light, but nonetheless the idea of a novelist facing her own death writing about literary mortality is something that moves me deeply. I believe that Dunmore's novels will survive. But she had another string to her bow: her work as a poet. I was quite unaware of this until I read that her posthumous collection of verse, Inside the Wave, won the 2017 Costa Poetry Award. I am reviewing it on another page. But knowing this makes me more sensitive to Will's description of the poet's process\u2026\nI see that you have the wrong idea about poets. We are makers, you know. We do not sit about admiring words. We must seize hold of them and chisel at them until they do what we want. Or what the poem wants, perhaps\u2014but that is another question.\n\u2026and even more receptive to the prose-poem that is Helen Dunmore's final paragraph in her Afterword:\nI want to end as I began, with Birdcage Walk itself. Time has taken away the church which was once attached to the graveyard: it was bombed to rubble in the Second World War. Rosebay willowherb grows so tall that the graves are all but hidden. No one lays flowers here; no one mourns. It is a beautiful place and also, on a winter night when rain thrashes down and light flickers through the cage of iron and lime branches, a place to make the living catch their breath, and hurry on.\n======The following, in order of publication, are links to my reviews of the other Dunmore books that I have read:\nZennor in Darkness (1994)A Spell of Winter (1996)Talking to the Dead (1996)The Siege (2002)The Betrayal (2012)Exposure (2016)Inside the Wave (poems, 2017)"}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41376337-karen", "userReview": "I received this ARC from netgalley.com in exchange for a review.

The main character in the novel is Lizzie, daughter of a radical mother (whose life and activities remind me of Mary Wollstonecraft) and wife of a builder (whose views are very different from those of Mary's family).Although this novel is interesting enough, I don't feel that is up to the same high standard as some of Dunmore's earlier novels, such as The Betrayal and The Siege. The part that I found most interesting in this book was not, in fact, linked in any way to the political situation being described therein. Instead it was the relationships that Lizzie had with her mother and her mother's friends, juxtaposed with her relationship with her husband, and how she managed any conflicts between the two, and how she developed as a person throughout the book. I also thought the descriptions of nature in the book were very good.One aspect of the book that I was rather surprised by, is that Dunmore, near to the beginning of the novel, clarified something that could in fact have been an interesting mystery throughout the book.

Lizzie's husband, Diner, is of a more traditional cast, wanting and expecting Lizzie to find fulfilment in the role of housewife. He is older than Lizzie and was married before to a Frenchwoman, Lucie. Lizzie loves Diner and wants to make him happy, but she feels increasingly restricted by his demands that she doesn't go out unaccompanied; and he seems jealous of everyone else she loves, especially her mother whom she adores. As Diner becomes ever more demanding, Lizzie begins to feel herself trapped...I so wanted to love this book, especially since it turned out to be Helen Dunmore's last.

So it is poignant, though apparently coincidental, that one of the themes she wanted to examine in the book is that of how \u201cthe individual vanishes from the historical record\u201d, especially women, whose lives were so often unrecorded and forgotten.Unfortunately, there are a few problems with the book that prevent it from reaching the highest standards. Firstly, the idea of discussing the Terror in France via those wannabes who cheered the revolutionaries on from the safety of England means that there is never any sense of emotional involvement in the events going on over in Paris. This is further exacerbated by Dunmore telling us about those events through letters and newspaper articles rather than taking us there. Of course, this is how people in England would have received the news, so in that sense it's an accurate portrayal. But it makes those passages feel more like a history lesson than part of a story.The second, and for me the major, problem is that Dunmore begins the book with a short series of prologue-like chapters which basically reveal almost everything that is to follow. So we know from the beginning that the building boom will collapse when war begins and the houses Diner is building will be a victim of that. We know that Julia is soon to die and her writings will be lost and forgotten, leaving no trace of her in the historical record. And we know that a man will bury the corpse of a woman in the woods \u2013 and although we are not told which man and which woman, it becomes blindingly obvious almost as soon as the story gets underway. Suspense may not be an essential feature of all books, but I suggest there ought always to be at least some doubt about how things will play out. Of course, we don't know exactly how it will end, but the bits that are left obscured are rather minor in comparison to those that are revealed too soon.There is no doubt about the quality of the writing, and the development of major and minor characters alike is excellent. I struggled with the idea that Lizzie would have given up a life of relative freedom to marry a man with such strict, traditional views on the role of women, but we all do stupid things for love when we're young, I suppose. Dunmore's portrayal of the stay-at-home revolutionaries rings true, as does her detailed description of life in Clifton at this moment in history. But I fear that detail itself gradually became my third issue with the book. Everything is described in far too much depth, from haggling over the purchase of a shawl to what to feed a baby whose mother can't suckle it. Each bit is vaguely interesting in its own right, thoroughly researched and certainly well described, but it all builds up until I finally felt I was drowning in minutiae, with the story sinking alongside me. I'm not sure at what point creating an authentic background becomes information overload but, wherever the line is, for me this book crossed it. And I suspect that's mainly because the prologue chapters had left me in little doubt of where the story was going so that I had no strong feeling of anticipation to drive me on.So the book's strengths lie in the quality of the writing and the authenticity of the setting and characterisation, and for these reasons it is still well worth reading. But sadly, the problems I had with it prevent me from giving it my wholehearted recommendation, much though I'd like to.NB This book was provided for review by the publisher, Grove Atlantic.www.fictionfanblog.wordpress.com"}, {"userName": "Mel (Epic Reading)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7074816-mel-epic-reading", "userReview": "Helen Dunmore has written a wonderful literary novel set in London during the French Revolution. Well developed characters and a unique perspective kept my interest; even though the plot doesn't show up in the first half of the book. Character Study The first 200 pages are a character study led by our lead gal, Lizzie, and her view of the world. There is virtually no plot at all during this portion of the novel. Instead we learn of Lizzie's marriage, family, class and more. I found it very interesting to have our leading lady caught between the ideologies of her family and those of her husband. With a mother that writes pamphlets and prose in support of the Revolution and eventual take down of the French King, it's understandable that Lizzie has a very independent view on politics. However her husband does not necessarily agree. As a true capitalist in a class society it becomes difficult for Lizzie's husband to accept that the Revolution is a good thing as it hurts his investments. We are lead to see Lizzie's unique thoughts and both perspectives on the French Revolution, even if from a safe (non-bloody) distance in London. PlotIt takes about 200 pages for Birdcage Walk to have some real plot. Once we get into the real story, and not just the characters and their setting, we are then treated to a fast paced mystery that Lizzie is caught in. I enjoyed the overall writing style and setting much better than the plot. I was more intrigued by Lizzie as a character than anything else. If Lizzie had been a boring, stuffy Londoner I would not have enjoyed this near as much. OverallThose who love historical fiction and character studies will likely enjoy this novel. If you're hoping for a book with intrigue and mystery then I recommend you pass; otherwise the first half of Birdcage Walk will possibly suck the life out of your reading enjoyment. This was my first Dunmore novel and I'll certainly look to read more by her.

Set in Bristol in 1792, Birdcage Walk is set against a backdrop of the French Revolution. It touches on Radical idealism, property, political turmoil and private tragedy. Inspired by the real life of Julia Fawkes, a leading Radical writer, none of whose work has survived, Dunmore explores the tensions between generations and genders, and examines the idea of legacy as Julia's daughter Lizzie finds herself torn between her charismatic, self made husband and her idealistic mother. As her husband Diner Tredevant speculates on property in Bristol's housing boom, he risks losing everything in the social upheaval caused by the French Revolution.Today in Episode One: A mysterious burial. The story opens four years earlier as a man hides a body in a gorge. The death is unexplained but four years later, the man has a wife - Lizzie Fawkes. Lizzie visits her mother who is ill, and tells her of her husband's Diner's plans to build a magnificent new terrace overlooking the Gorge. It is to be the envy of the city but for Diner a huge financial risk.An acclaimed poet and award-winning novelist, Helen Dunmore's work often explores the interplay between the public and the personal, most famously in The Siege and The Betrayal, and most recently Exposure.Hattie Morahan is a stage, film and TV actress who won numerous awards for her portrayal of Nora in the Young Vic production of A Doll's House.

Lizzie\u2019s motivation for marriage to John Diner Tredevant is complicated: part passion and, seemingly, part desire for a place of her own following her mother\u2019s remarriage. However, her mother, Julia, remains an influential figure in Lizzie\u2019s life.Lizzie is Diner\u2019s second wife and I found echoes of Daphne du Maurier\u2019s Rebecca as Lizzie is tormented with curiosity about her predecessor, Lucie, who she is told died in childbirth in her native France. \u2018I wondered if any of the men had known Lucie\u2026They would have seen her. They might have spoke to her. When they saw me, perhaps they compared me to her.\u2019 Like the second Mrs de Winter in Rebecca, Lizzie wonders if she can live up to Lucie\u2019s place in Diner\u2019s memory. \u2018I could not see into his thoughts. I was almost afraid to look into them, in case I found Lucie there. Perhaps he was trying to remake with me the life he had loved so much with her.\u2019As Lizzie learns more about Lucie, doubts about the circumstances of Diner\u2019s first marriage start to surface \u2013 doubts the reader may have shared since the opening of the novel. Though this element of mystery runs throughout the novel, it is only one of a number of ideas the book engages with.For instance, the novel explores the contrast between those who can be categorised as doers or makers \u2013 like Diner \u2013 and those whose currency is ideas \u2013 like Augustus and Lizzie\u2019s mother, Julia. As Diner says about Augustus: \u201cCan he lay a flagstone floor? No. He depends upon those who can. He is as much a guest in the world as a three-year-old child.\u201d Lizzie moves between the two worlds, recognising the difference in belief and outlook that separates them. \u2018Diner lay in the daylight world of building, land and money. His imagination went into stone.\u2019Lizzie\u2019s husband, John Diner Tredevant is a wonderfully complex creation \u2013 if it\u2019s not too much of a clich\u00e9, he\u2019s a real Jekyll and Hyde character. On the one hand he is entrepreneurial, single-minded, astute, a self-made man, appreciative of craft skills. \u2018He was lit up all through those weeks of early summer. He could see the stone curve of the terrace shaping itself according to his vision and he did not care how hard he drove the men\u2019.On the other, he is moody, prone to jealousy, possessive, secretive, a hard taskmaster, a man with, one senses, pent-up anger lying just below the surface. Although outwardly loving towards Lizzie, his behaviour shares many of the characteristics of what we would now recognise as coercive control. Added to which, of course, the law considers Lizzie a chattel of her husband. As Diner reminds her, \u201cYou have nothing of your own. You are my wife. All that you have belongs to me. All that you are belongs to me.\u201dFor Augustus and Julia, and those who share their radical views, the initial events of the French Revolution provide a concrete example of the people exercising their rights. \u2018Human beings really were capable of uniting to defeat tyranny and injustice. A new order could be created, based on the rights of man. And woman too\u2026 .Everything they had dreamed of and written about was coming to pass, not two hundred miles from London.\u2019But as events in France spiral out of control, Augustus and Julia struggle to reconcile their beliefs with the bloodshed and killings. Lizzie gets closer to home than she imagines when she observes to Diner, \u2018Once you have taken one life, why not any number? What is to protect you from evil then?\u2026Think of it, Diner. To kill another human being is like crossing a river by a bridge which is then swept away behind you. You can never go back again.\u2019Diner, with his customary shrewdness, foresees how events in France will create upheaval across Europe and threaten war. Before long, his building scheme and the precarious finances on which it is based, is in jeopardy. \u201cIt is this damned uncertainty!\u201d he burst out. \u201cThere is no reason in it. It is uncertainty which is killing the market. If there is war with France \u2013 no one knows, and so no one will act.\u201d And desperate situations can breed desperate acts as the reader will discover.Some reviewers have described the novel as \u2018slow\u2019, perhaps because the mystery contained with the story takes a long time to play out alongside the other story lines. I would instead categorise the novel\u2019s pace as measured or considered, giving plenty of opportunity to appreciate some of the great writing: \u2018My mother was the spinning jenny who span out words to clothe the ideas that burst and bubbled in their brains.\u2019 My one reservation about the novel was the prologue, set in the present day, which seems to serve little purpose.This is the first novel I\u2019ve read by Helen Dunmore but, on the strength of Birdcage Walk, I will definitely seek out her other books. In her Afterword, the author writes that, \u2018The question of what is left behind by a life haunts the novel.\u2019 Helen Dunmore\u2019s untimely death earlier this year sadly means there will be no more books from this talented author but, as far as \u2018what is left behind by a life\u2019, in her case it is a legacy of intriguing, thoughtful literature.I received an advance reader copy courtesy of NetGalley and publishers Grove Atlantic in return for an honest review."}, {"userName": "J.A.

It has the same claustrophobic, flat and disenchanted feel as Du Maurier's Rebecca - which perhaps sounds like I'm not really trying to sell the experience of this book but I absolutely am. That precise set up is very difficult to achieve but Dunmore does it with a few deft and apparently effortless touches. It is set in Bristol after the French Revolution - I've not read many books that deal with the aftermath of the revolution in other European countries so this was an eye opener. I don't think I ever considered the effects our close neighbour's revolution had o the UK. Lizzie is a free spirited, intelligent and innocent girl who grew up in a radical family. Her conservative husband who is utterly loathsome, has a real fear and desire for her, believing that she must be controlled in all ways. This is almost classic 'she would be perfect if I could just change her' type mentality and it is sinister watching it take effect in this story. All the threads are drawn together steadily as the book progresses trapping the reader as effectively as the characters are also trapped in their unhealthy relationship.

At this time, 'Europe is seized by political turmoil and violence'. The Observer calls Birdcage Walk 'the finest novel Dunmore has written'. The Daily Telegraph deem it 'Quietly brilliant... among the best fiction of our time.' The Guardian believe it to be 'a blend of beauty and horror evoked with such breathtaking poetry that it haunts me still'. The novel was longlisted for the Walter Scott Prize, and has been rather highly praised by critics, as the above quotes demonstrate.Lizzie Fawkes, the protagonist of the novel, is the product of a childhood lived in Radical circles, 'where each step of the French Revolution is followed with eager idealism'. Lizzie has recently married a property developer named John Diner Tredevant, who is 'heavily invested' in their city's housing boom, and has 'everything to lose from social upheaval and the prospect of war'. He is displeased with Lizzie's 'independent, questioning spirit', and is of the conviction that she should live and behave only in the manner he wishes her to. In 1793, war was declared between Britain and France, which led to the collapse of the housing boom in Bristol, causing many builders and developers to go bankrupt; this, of course, affects Lizzie and John.The novel opens in present day Bristol, where a dogwalker comes across an overgrown grave: 'If my friends hadn't decided that I should have a dog I would never have opened the gate and gone into the graveyard. I always took the paved path between the railings. Birdcage Walk, it's called, because of the pleached lime trees arching overhead on their cast iron frame.' The grave which his dog, Jack, first discovers 'leaned only slightly backwards'. The name inscribed upon it is Julia Elizabeth Fawkes, an eighteenth-century writer. The narrator is able to find no information about her whatsoever online, and goes to an open day at her known residence in order to ask an archivist what they are able to find out.The novel proper begins with rather a chilling chapter. It begins: 'He must have shut his eyes. When he opened them, there she was. She lay as he had left her, under a tree in the brambles and ivy. He had laid her out straight, and crossed her hands, and then he had wrapped his coat about her head. He had known that she would stiffen in a few hours, and that he would not want to see her once again. There she was. No one had come; he'd known that no one would come. It was his luck. There were no marks where he had dragged her, because he had lifted her in his arms and carries her.' This man, unknown to us at first, then digs a grave and buries her, before scurrying away. The second chapter of the novel, and the majority of those which follow, are narrated by Lizzie, whose mother is a writer.The descriptions in Birdcage Walk are sometimes inventive, and have a vivacity to them. For instance, Dunmore writes: 'But the moon was inside too. It had got into the bedroom while we were sleeping. Its light walked about over the bedstead, over the chest, the basin in its stand and the blue-and-white jug. It was a restless thing and I could not lie still.' I found the first couple of chapters, and the differentiation between tone, character, and period intriguing, but I soon found myself losing interest in the story once Lizzie's account began. Her voice felt too settled, and I could not invest enough empathy in her plight. The dialogue felt forced, unnatural, and repetitive, and the prose and plot were too slow, and plodded along. Julia Fawkes was a real person, but I felt as though Dunmore had no hold upon her character. Whilst Dunmore often excels in her novels with her descriptions of the natural world, and in setting scenes, I did not quite feel as though this was the case here.Birdcage Walk deals with 'legacy and recognition - what writers, especially women writers, can expect to leave behind them'. This has an added poignancy, given Dunmore's untimely death last year. Unfortunately, whilst I have very much enjoyed several of Dunmore's novels in the past, Birdcage Walk neither lived up to its premise, nor to its praise, for me. I am all for slow novels, but I like my historical fiction to be highly absorbing, and well anchored in the period. Unfortunately, Birdcage Walk was neither."}, {"userName": "Chrissie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33603612-chrissie", "userReview": "A quiet novel, yet buzzing with life, Birdcage Walk is a landmine of a tale on the human experience. When I say 'quiet'\u2014I mean it. Like humming. Like a whisper. Like a story being relayed secretly in a dark room. In fact, its slow nature made me afraid that it would dip into the realm of boring, but it never did. It moved along with increasing and surprising urgency. The narrator, Elizabeth, is not terribly young in age, but incredibly na\u00efve in spirit and awareness. So, we almost have a bildungsroman here, as she grows and changes in small ways throughout the book. Her eyes open and she finds her voice all while being surrounded by a mystery she slowly comes to acknowledge.Despite its slower pace, I was pleased to find this story an incredibly engaging one with broad, expansive characters and fully realized settings. The atmosphere is tight, constrained, and claustrophobic, as written by Dunmore, pressing down on the reader as Lizzie stumbles her way through this astoundingly important time in her life. This is a deep and moving novel with the French Revolution and the events leading up to France declaring war on England as the backdrop. Despite that heavy time in history serving as the background, the focus remains on Lizzie throughout the book. However, Lizzie's mother, Julia, is the reason we dive into the story. The novel opens with a man and his dog discovering the grave marker for Julia Fawkes. This man learns that Julia was a pamphleteer in England during the time leading up to the French Revolution. All her work has been lost, and even we as the readers never discover more than a tiny snippet of her writing ability. This novel's author, Helen Dunmore, died of cancer earlier this year, and I love that there's an afterword in her own voice about her experience writing this book. There's something very poignant about this author writing about another writer whose words have been lost.

I loved all the characters in this novel. She captures the complexity of human nature so profoundly. I particularly loved her rendition of the complexity of John Diner and Lizzie\u2019s passion for him. Dunmore has created another Heathcliffe and in spite of the danger bubbling under the surface, she creates a credible comprehension of just why Lizzie married him and loves him (but also fears him). This is a story of marriage, of grief and the cycle of life: death and birth are tightly intertwined. Helen Dunmore\u2019s deft handling of language is always surprising to me.

It's a good premise. Birdcage Walk begins in the present day, as a dog walker stumbles on a grave and starts to wonder about the long dead individual. This first chapter was lively and engaging and I felt optimistic about what was to come.Then we step back in time, to Bristol in 1792. Across the Channel, France is in chaos as the Revolution plays out, whereas in Bristol there is fear about what impact it will all have. Our narrator is Lizzie, the young second wife to a property developer, John Diner. She is curious about his first wife, whom he never speaks about. The uncertain economy is affecting Diner's business and creating tensions within their marriage.

In her latest and sadly, last novel, Birdcage Walk, Ms. Dunmore chose the period of the French Revolution as her timeframe. John Diner Tredevant is a builder and land speculator. He has borrowed money to build a terrace of houses overlooking The Gorge at a most unpropitious time. His wife Lizzie is the daughter of idealists whose support of the French Revolution puts them in constant danger. As Diner\u2019s business continues to fail and his debtors close in, his moods become more erratic and he questions Lizzie\u2019s independence. His past begins to intrude on their present and as she finds out more, Lizzie begins to fear for more than their ability to withstand these financial blows to their future. Birdcage Walk is a dark and brooding book, most likely drawing its nature from the excellently drawn character of Diner. I had less feeling for Lizzie, whose innocence and immaturity I found grating at times. The conversations that take place at her stepfather\u2019s house give good context to the current events of the period.

Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The premise is certainly promising. Set in Bristol in 1792, Lizzie Fawkes' husband, John Diner is a speculative property developer building up-market housing overlooking the Severn Gorge in Clifton. But the French Revolution is in full flow, the King is about to go to the guillotine and nervousness is spreading across the rest of Europe, and especially England, where the imminent threat of war makes Diner's houses hard to sell. Lizzie is an engaging and strong character as is her radical feminist writer mother (shades of Mary Wollstonecraft). However, the male characters are less convincing. Her radical pamphleteer stepfather stays largely in the background and Lizzie's hinted at romance with a young poet, Will Forrest, is also a damp squib. But most disappointing is John Diner who comes across as far too underpowered to be convincing as the murderously controlling husband. Having said all that, there is much good writing- a strong sense of time and place and some excellent details of day to day domestic life.

He begins to look at an earlier history of Bristol (the setting of the book) The gravestone belonged to a woman who was not just \u2018a writer\u2019 but a revolutionary thinker \u2013 the time is that of the French Revolution. The narrator of this book is her daughter, Lizzie. Her mother, Julia Fawkes, might almost be another Mary Wollstonecroft, and her second husband, Augustus, another Godwin. Lizzie, though, is not married to a revolutionary poet. Her husband John Diner Tredevant is in his own way a visionary : one ablaze with the idea of building, property and capital.Dunmore\u2019s book is a book of ideas and ideals, a book of strong and conflicting relationship, and also a thriller \u2013 though I suspect the reader will identify quite early where things are headingVisions of a better society for all based on those heady, revolutionary ideas which rocked the stability of society in this country and in France are set against the ideas of order and security. And the creeping in of doubts as some of the initial idealism of \u2018libert\u00e9 \u00e9galit\u00e9 fraternit\u00e9\u2019 \u2013 not to mention sororit\u00e9 - meets the fact that a revolution is rarely bloodless :\u201cI could not explain it even to myself, that a man might set in motion such a lever and put an end to the world that lived inside another\u2019s head. It seemed so monstrous and yet it could be done so easily. It made killing as simple as pouring a cup of water, There was no danger to the killer, or necessity to wrestle with a fellow creature who would fight for his life as hard as you fought to extinguish it\u201d \u2026\u2026.\u201cThink of it \u2026To kill another human being is like crossing a river by a bridge which is then swept away behind you. You can never go back again\u201dThe central relationship in this book is that between visionary Julia Fawkes and her beloved daughter. Lizzie has fallen for a man who may not be worthy of her, and wants a conventional, obedient wife rather than the free thinker she has been raised to be. This is also a novel about how love can break, as much as make, a person.\u201cI saw clearly now that it was not so easy to step out of the life which held us. No matter how far we went, we would take with us not only our selves but all the ghosts of our lives.\u201dThe novel is also one which is full of psychological tension. There are several ways an author might choose to create tension, each of which can work well, if properly done. Duncan means the reader, I think, to make the links pretty quickly between a shocking event which is described very early on in the eighteenth century section and who the people involved might be. So it is not the reader and their direct need to know \u2018what happens next\u2019 which is the setting on the tension knot. Rather, we are immediately lobbed the \u2018something major happened\u2019 in order that we should solve that \u2018something\u2019 Our tension is rather for the central character in the book, how they change, what changes them, and how they will make the connections as they come to understand what we already are sure of. It\u2019s an empathetic tension she is creatingOne small cavil, but not enough to want to dock a star. The first person narrator of the historical section is not fluent in French. Yet, there is a conversation which takes place entirely in French, where she faithfully can recount everything a French speaking character says, even though she only picks out a couple of forcefully spoken and repeated words (which she asks someone else to translate) I have no problems with the forcefully spoken and repeated words but would defy anyone, spoken to a language which they were pretty lacking fluency in, to be able to make sound and memory sense of it! A moment which felt inauthentic, and jarred.Finally, in a poignant afterword, Dunmore explains her fascination with small, hidden lives, and their effect on history, and her intention in this novel \u2013 which she began before knowing her own terminal diagnosis\u201cOnly a very few people leave traces in history, or even bequeath family documents to their descendants. Most have no money to memorialise themselves, and lack even a gravestone to mark their existence. Women\u2019s lives, in particular, remain largely unrecorded. But even so, did they not shape the future? Through their existences, through their words and acts, their gestures, jokes, caresses, strength and courage \u2013 and through the harms they did as well \u2013 they changed the lives around them and formed the lives of their descendants\u201dI received this as a review copy from Netgalley, and read it during my 2 month reviewing absence. It was with pleasure that I read it again, as I did want to be able to write a review which expressed my pleasure in the book, properly"}, {"userName": "Pam Hutley", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70000921-pam-hutley", "userReview": "A book of smells and tastes, sights and sounds. It is an engrossing historical tale and so real you can feel it all. The characters are drawn clearly with depth and sensitivity. Never over romanticised never glossed over. Even relatively minor characters are afforded descriptions which take them beyond the stereotype. Each has a mind and a soul. Interestingly it is all about what is not researchable, not discovered of the lives of women who could have been historically significant who had strength of character , great convictions, who wrote and lived but about whom nothing remains except a weed infested grave long forgotten ."}], "description": "It is 1792 and Europe is seized by political turmoil and violence.Lizzie Fawkes has grown up in Radical circles where each step of the French Revolution is followed with eager idealism.But she has recently married John Diner Tredevant, a property developer who is heavily invested in Bristol\u2019s housing boom, and he has everything to lose from social upheaval and the prospect of war.
