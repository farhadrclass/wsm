Ash is an elite soldier chick who is framed for the murder of her entire crew and finds herself reunited with the man who trained her, a stoic commander dude named Rykus, who's been tasked with getting information out of Ash about her last mission. I LOVED this at first. There was good tension between Ash and Rykus. Ash's POVs were awesome (Rykus not so much, but whatever), the action scenes were exciting, and the plot was suspenseful. It was all going great until it wasn't :P Sex Stuff comes out of nowhere (seriously man, it was awkwardly done and just plain weird given the circumstances) and the romance as a whole was super gag (and Rykus's POVs got progressively worse and worse). The Sex Stuff and Romance were written too cheesily for me, and it somehow suffocated the better parts of the story. I really enjoyed the telepathy aspect of the plot and I still think Ash is a great character, so I may continue this series."}, {"userName": "Anna (Bobs Her Hair)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3167458-anna-bobs-her-hair", "userReview": "Grade: B-The beginning of Shades of Treason packs adrenaline-rushing action.

The suspense and romance plots married well here because only Ramie and Rhys' previous relationship allows them to win because who else will believe her innocence? Plus, Shades of Treason actually explores the ethics of a commander/subordinate relationship. Ramie, the heroine, convinces as a soldier, which is rare in genre fic these days, because she's practical and deploys some recognizable fighting/survival skills. Because she was so believable I liked the super soldier aspect. God-mode can kills books, but the super soldiers were just people amped up and deployed in different fields, meaning the stakes were still high and intense. Ramie definitely showed both vulnerability and strength. Both characters admired each other and were strong without taking away from each other, a hard balance to strike. It's rare I root for a couple this much. Great plausible action too, fast-paced and researched. Sandy Williams has a light, subtle hand I appreciate. Not to say that there weren't telepaths and almost physiological brainwashing, etc. It is scifi! Four/five stars. Disappointed the sequel isn't available yet.

Learning that telepaths existed and that they had infiltrated the Coalition would make them suspect everyone. The senators already fought and argued and threatened to secede. She wouldn\u2019t give them more fuel to burn their ties.\u2019\nLieutenant Ramie Ashdyn and her team are sent on a mission by the Coalition to steal classified information from the Saricean\u2019s but she is the only survivor. She is subsequently blamed for their deaths and charged with treason. She\u2019s left unable to speak the truth of the situation in order to clear her name because her mind has been altered by a telepath. The proof of the existence of telepaths is the classified information that her team stole and inevitably gave their lives to keep secret because the knowledge of this may be the very thing to tear the Coalition apart.\n\u2018In three days, Rykus would lead a contingent of soldiers in a daring, deadly assault on an enemy shipyard. In three days, the Coalition and the Sariceans would be at war.\u2019\nAshdyn is a stubborn, badass chick who has no problem taking care of herself. Growing up starving on the streets of Glory, she volunteered to become a soldier of the Coalition. She also discovered she\u2019s faster and more powerful than any human being: she\u2019s an anomaly. We\u2019re given very little of her background and the details behind being an anomaly and while it was enough to clarify most questions, I wanted more details because it was an extremely interesting concept. I loved the inclusion of Commander Rhys Rykus and the whole concept behind the loyalty training as well. Due to an issue with an anomaly\u2019s mental stability, they underwent loyalty training which made them dependable soldiers that would follow instruction and wouldn\u2019t snap under the strain they underwent. Commander Rhys Rykus was Ashdyn\u2019s instructor and he\u2019s been requested to use that loyalty training in order to get the classified information from her. It doesn\u2019t help matters that the two have a very complicated and heated rapport, both denying the existence of feelings they may have because a relationship between them is out of the question.Conspiracies, treason, and intrigue oh my! Shades of Treason includes all of that and more (like a pretty hot relationship build-up). I hope to see more delving into the world-building in subsequent installments. Specifically, I\u2019d love to know more about anomaly\u2019s and not just who the Saricean\u2019s are but what caused the war between them and the Coalition. Nonetheless this is still an auspicious start to an exciting series that I\u2019m most looking forward to!I received this book free from Book Tour in exchange for an honest review.

Ramie Ashdyn being interrogated by Commander Rhys Rykus. Ash is an anomaly, a rare group of people with enhanced abilities. They represent only 2% of the known universe. Anomalies volunteer for loyalty training in which they choose to give up their free will in order to better serve The Coalition. Commander Rykus is a renowned trainer of anomalies. Ash was one of his students, the first female graduate of the program. Ash has been trained to be absolutely loyal to the Commander. However, in the year of training under his command, she was a wildcard - always teasing and pushing against his stoicism. She had a talent for riling him up. Was it mere teasing, or something else? Ash is in trouble because she has essential information for the Coalition against its enemies. However, she has been exposed to mind control, a version of psychological warfare, in which she cannot speak about the data or the circumstances surrounding her last mission without blanking out. Furthermore, it is unclear whether it is a good thing for her superiors to possess this information. Ash believes that it has the potential to tear The Coalition apart. I really enjoyed the premise of this science fiction story. The narrative is imaginative and creative. There are heartbeat-raising moments. There is action and adventure and a pretty good romance. The sexual tension between Ash and Rykus is crackling and if you\u2019ve ever had a crush on a teacher, you will easily understand her attraction. I am a fan of Sandy William\u2019s Shadow Reader series and her writing style continues to be very engaging. Ms. Williams puts us right into the middle of the action. This book has lots of potential, but unfortunately, it is not fully realized. When a writer knows that he or she is going write a series, there has to be a balance between wrapping up the current story, and yet, leave the reader wanting for more. This story is a little imbalanced. There are too many unanswered questions and not enough closure. I did not finish completely satisfied. But because I know this is a series, I can be patient and can hope to learn more in the next novel. Sandy Williams, bring it on!IN A NUTSHELL:This is a fantastic, albeit a little incomplete, read. Despite my disappointment with dangling storylines, I\u2019m still happy I read the book. It is worth your investment and time because the series potential is outstanding.

My feelings are totally bi-polar in so many areas, I\u2019m not sure this will even make sense! BUT... here goes...Overall, this book is a high-octane, edge-of-your-seat, non-stop, action-packed science fiction thrill ride. From the moment the first page is turned to the minute the last page is read the story never stalls. Usually that is a great thing (and it did keep me up until the middle of the night reading). The downside for me, however, was because of the way the story was set-up, for over half the book the major emotion was incredible stress! To explain: Ash is accused of horrifically killing all her team and is set to be executed for treason if she doesn\u2019t speak up. BUT, she can\u2019t speak up because the people who really are responsible telepathically blocked her mind so every time she tries, she blanks out. To everyone but herself, it looks like she just spaces out and won\u2019t answer. She is repeatedly interrogated and tortured but there is nothing she can do but try and escape. On top of that, the man she cares most in the world for is the one assigned to get the information from her. See what I mean? STRESSFUL to read! It\u2019s genius on the author\u2019s part because the reader knows the truth and experiences the same desperate emotions Ash\u2019s character does. Still, I\u2019m not sure I like being totally stressed out throughout 2/3 of a book I\u2019m reading for enjoyment. So - while it\u2019s incredibly well done - I\u2019m not sure I liked it. AND.... as a side note - the one area I think the author really went off-track was the sex scene. Made absolutely no sense given the circumstances. Completely awkward placement in the plot and not needed.

It definitely ranks 4.5 stars. I couldn't put the darn thing down - the mystery of the whole thing really intrigued me. The characters were well drawn and developed. This whole book is a classic example of showing instead of telling - the author did not give us page upon page of glassy-eyed page development, she just landed us in her world and told her story. If this had any failing, it was that, perhaps, the world wasn't quite adequately developed and I'm not really sure what the \"Coalition\" was or who belonged to it. Or why I should hate the Saraceans . . . . or even, and maybe the greatest failing, what exactly an Anomaly WAS. Could be I read it too fast for the knowledge to sink in. I did really enjoy the characters. It is written in 3rd person with some character POV hopping, but not enough to bother me. The bad guy is really bad and the good guys are believable. For all my demand of relationships, relationships, relationships, there is really only 1 that is developed here, but I really didn't miss them - the story as it was developed just really held my attention.

I was not at all disappointed. Shades of Treason has non-stop action and is riddled with great characters, terrific twists and turns, and a promising romance. Let's start with the obvious...this is sci-fi. Some of you might lean more toward fantasy and paranormal, as I tend to do. Make no mistake, this is definitely a science fiction story. However, it is not at all overwrought with science-y terms or so futuristic that you can't enjoy the story. Readers who enjoy UF will really be able to get into this story and not get hung up on the science. I was fully engrossed, and there were only a few times that I had to back up and reread to fully understand. A large part of the story takes place on a ship (think outer space, not the sea) and a few of the descriptions of things on this futuristic ship were the only times I found myself really needing to read again.Now, the characters. This story is told from the alternating POVs of Ashdyn and Rhys Rykus. Ash is the only female \"anomaly\" to be a part of a loyalty training program that makes her a stronger and better soldier but attaches her mind's loyalty to a commander. She is a bit feisty and bucks against authority, despite her loyalty to the Coalition and her job as a soldier. She is a complex character, balancing logic with impulsiveness, indoctrination with rebelliousness. Sometimes her attitude reminded me of a grown up Rose from Vampire Academy. She wavers back and forth between admirable and infuriating. Its a purposeful waver, as it gives her character a lot of layers. Sometimes you love her and feel for her and sometimes you want to jump through your book and shake her! She has the added challenge of not being able to actually speak about the events that took place on her previous mission, the events that led to her entire team being murdered and her being named a traitor. This challenge causes a lot of the action and conflict in the story that I both loved and bit my nails while reading. Rhys Rykus is is beloved and decorated Commander is the Coalition's military. He is also the Commander to whom Ash's loyalty is attached. With a certain voice and intent, he can give her a direction that she almost always has to follow. He's the strong and silent type for sure, more action than words. It was good that we got to read from his POV because I don't know that I would have really understood him as well if the entire story had been from Ash's POV. He is constantly having an internal battle with himself about roughly five different things at any given time. One of those battles is over his feelings for Ash...first because everyone thinks she is a traitor and later because he is her Commander. Their romance is sure to be complicated over however many more books we can expect in this series. The last thing I MUST talk about is all the action in this book! There was something exciting happening nonstop. I tore through this book in a very short period of time, which is reminiscent of Williams' other series. This is why I suggest this book to lovers of UF. Those readers will greatly appreciate all of the action: multiple mysteries, never knowing exactly who to trust, well thought out fight scenes, a kick-ass heroine, etc. I highly recommend this start to the new Anomaly series! I was totally absorbed in Shades of Treason the entire time I was reading it. I look forward to what happens to Ash and Rykus next!This review is based on an advance copy of the book, provided by the book tour."}, {"userName": "Lyndi loathes love triangles", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5913818-lyndi-loathes-love-triangles", "userReview": "Lots of action, very little romance, fade to black ending that's basically a cliffhanger.I liked Ash's attitude, but it's hard to determine if her affections for Rykus are enhanced by the loyalty training.

But I like the way these two characters play off each other and I'm very much interested in how things proceed between them while they try to save the universe.I've got the sequel on my TBR list, but I'm so aggravated with the ending that I'm gonna put it off for a little bit and read something else first."}, {"userName": "Christina Marie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10872969-christina-marie", "userReview": "**This book was given to me in exchange for my honest review**This is the first book that I've read by this author, and after reading this one I can definitely say that I would love to read more by her!SHADES OF TREASON is a Sci Fi/ Fantasy book that follows Lt. Ramie Ashdyn (Ash), who is classified as an anomaly -- which is basically a person whose genetic composition makes them a stronger and more intelligent person.

Through his actions, there is much discovered, such as Ash being telepathically silenced. While trying to get to the bottom of the situation, Ash and Rhys find themselves, not only battling an enemy, they also find themselves battling their feelings for one another.I really had a good time with this book. There was a lot to take in -- the world, the characters, everything. But it was a good story. The characters were fascinating enough to me, and in my opinion, they were the most interesting aspect of the story. Especially Ash. The plot was pretty gripping at times, but then there were moments when it felt a little disconnected from the characters and their budding relationship. It was almost like I was reading a romance within a sci fi novel, but I didn't care about the sci fi part. But those moments were few and far in between.I think, especially when it comes to first books in a series, there's going to be an information dump. There's a lot of set up involved. A lot of characters to meet. A lot of world to building. So, I understand why I felt so overwhelmed at times. I feel that way about most first books. But the good part about all of that is -- despite the info dump and the few disconnected moments, I was never once bored. I was still curious as to what the heck was going on and what was going to happen.The action scenes, especially the ones where Ash was being a badass, were some of my favorite moments in the book. Because they were really easy to picture. Ash is a admirable character. Through quite flawed and hard shelled, she is such a good character. There's a lot of depth to her and Rhys is the perfect balance for her. I really appreciate the Williams allowed the progression of the relationships to be as turbulent and as uneven as the plot progression. There was nothing smooth about this story. There were many ups and downs. There was chaos. And I think the relationships mimicked that. The supporting characters were purposeful and very important to the plot's pace and to the development of certain characters. I didn't really feel that much was unnecessary in the telling of this story and I really am interested to see what happens next. The story ends at a spot that doesn't necessarily signify a cliffhanger, but there is a hint of \"there's more to come\".Overall, I thought this was a pretty solid effort on the part of Williams.

A couple days went by and I was feeling really bad that I hadn't written a review yet, because this book certainly deserves a review. I couldn't quite put my finger on why I was vaguely dissatisfied until a week after I finished it I finally figured it out. The amazing cast of supporting characters that Mrs. Williams is capable of writing is missing! There are really only two characters that I would think of as supporting characters and unfortunately they do not have a large presence, even though they are both integral to the story in their own ways. Before you get all dismayed about poorly drawn characters though, let me reassure you that is not the case. Mrs. Williams chooses to focus all of her powers on the two main characters Ash and RIP who share alternating POVs in this book. These are strong, well-defined, relate-able, conflicted characters that you will start to root for from the first chapter. One of the beautiful things is that even though RIP and Ash are in conflict you want both of them to win - it's fantastic! BTW - If you don't find yourself grinning, and even outright laughing, when you read the banter between Ash and RIP maybe you are more of a science text book kind of person because that stuff is funny.Speaking of the first chapter, Mrs. Williams definitely knows how to write a hook that pulls you along through the rest of the book. You will become invested in the characters immediately, no slow-burn here.I am eagerly awaiting the second book, this author has so much stuff to write that I want to read. I am intensely hopeful that now that the battle-lines have been clearly drawn each side will gain a cast of supporting characters (hint, hint, wink, wink) and then this series will undoubtedly make it onto my favorites list, too."}, {"userName": "Cheryl La Pa", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20985154-cheryl-la-pa", "userReview": "Loved it! I am a big fan of Ms William's Shadow Reader series and was delighted to hear that she had a new series out. And she did not disappoint. Shades of Treason is an impressive first book in the Anomaly series.Loved the characters. Loved the sexual tension and banter between Rykus and Ash. Ash is one tough woman with a steely determination and iron will. Rykus is just as tough and determined as Ash, though unfortunately most of the time they are trying to achieve opposing goals. Loved the originality and the action. It was adrenaline-pumping, heart-stopping action from start to finish and I loved the original, unpredictable plot. I did find it confusing in the beginning of the book, with the world building and introduction of all the characters and their pasts, but it all came together for me as I read on and became involved in the story. I eagerly await the next book in the series so that I can dive back into Rykus and Ash's world again."}, {"userName": "Make Kay", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23930728-make-kay", "userReview": "Huh. I thought I had written a review of this book, because boy howdy, did I love it! I squeed about it on many, many book blogs for months after reading it. If you love Rachel Bach's Paradox trilogy, trust me, you will love this book.It's hard to find Sci Fi romance, although fortunately it's getting a little easier as more great authors are joining to write about love in space (and elsewhere!). Shades of Treason feels like mix of UF and sci fi. It's got a totally kick ass female protagonist, which I just love. Fans of Ilona Andrews' Kate Daniels and Cat from Jeanine Frosts' Night Huntress series will salivate over Ash, who is a larger than life anomaly who is stronger and faster than the humans around her. There's great battles and action, and a wallop of political intrigue. This book has it all.I can't wait for book 2, Shades of Honor, which is coming out shortly!!"}], "description": "Ash would have given her life to save her teammates.Instead, they gave their lives to save hers.Lieutenant Ramie Ashdyn is an anomaly, a person whose genetic makeup makes her stronger and smarter than the average human.

Or so he tells himself.Ash wants nothing more than to clear her name and be the woman her former instructor wants her to be, but the enemy who killed her teammates did more than frame her for treason and murder: they telepathically silenced her mind, preventing her from saying anything that might point to the truth about what happened.Now Ash is trapped and set to be executed, the truth dying with her.
