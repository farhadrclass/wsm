Guilt over his best friend's death plagues him and worsens his traumatic medical \"episodes.\" When Chris's younger sister, Beth Martindale, shows up in town, Mark isn't sure he wants to see her. She reminds him of Chris and the friendship he cherished, but Mark has to watch over her, doesn't he? She's Chris's younger sister, and she's new in town. That's what Chris would want him to do. When a killer targets Beth, Mark determines to recover the strength he lost. First off, don't you just love the cover? The design incorporates so many facets of Dog Tags, and one of the reasons I was thrilled to get my hands on this debut novel by Heidi Glick. Beth and Mark are well-constructed characters with a shared history, weaknesses, and goals. I'm a sucker for stories with beloved pets, and Sparky, Mark's dog, played a big part in this book.If you're looking for a quick book you can read late at night, this isn't the one. Filled with appearances by \"The Knight,\" Glick kept me guessing on the villain's identity until the end of the book. The romance lover in me would have enjoyed this book as much without the suspense, but that's just me. Overall, a winner, and I'll be looking for more from Heidi Glick!Disclosure: Sending a big thank you to the author for providing me with a copy of this book in exchange for my fair and unbiased review.

This book was fast paced and very interesting.Growing up, Beth Martindale had a huge crush on her older brother's friend, Mark Graham. Ten years down the road and lots of things have changed. Mark was the man who desperately tried to save Beth's brother's life when they were in the Marines together. The fact that he failed to do so and was injured in the process has defined his life up to this point. When Beth and Mark reconnect, will they both be able to start fresh or will the loss of someone they both cared deeply for hinder a possible relationship?There is another current running under the story of Mark and Beth's relationship. Beth becomes the victim of a stalker. She begins receiving disturbing notes and things escalate from there. Will Mark be able to save her from harm or will his disability make him unable to keep her safe?Dog Tags has a great love story running through it and also a satisfying suspense story. It was a very enjoyable read."}, {"userName": "Allison Kohn", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21184249-allison-kohn", "userReview": "I am really enjoying this book. It's well written and has all the characteristics of a compelling read: suspense, mystery, and a love angle that is realistic and mature. The tension with the knight gets stronger with each encounter and guessing who he might be is as hard as trying to drive through a foggy rain soaked night. There are so many mysteries and the solutions are slippery, at best. I cab tell by the other reviews who actually read the book before writing a review and I have to say, some missed a really good read by putting it aside before actually reading it."}, {"userName": "Catherine", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159502-catherine", "userReview": "I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.This isn't my typical genre. I'm don't read much suspense romance, but the plot intrigued me. I'm glad I picked it up, because it was a fast, enjoyable read. I liked both the characters of Beth and Mark, as well as the secondary characters (though I wish we could have seen a bit more of Beth's friends). I felt their romance was naturally developed, and I got a chuckle every time Beth would tease Martin about being old (my friends and I do that to each other now that we're in our thirties as well). Perhaps the most disappointing aspect was that both characters kept secrets when I don't think they really had to. It was a bit frustrating that they just wouldn't talk about them. But I suppose that's true of real life, so it's not so much a negative as a personal disappointment. I also wish the Knight had been explored a bit more. While we had several chapters from his point of view and we did know his motivation, I was left wondering about his past victim and who she was and how she was killed. Regardless, his motivation for stalking was different than I expected, and I found it interesting. I really did enjoy this book, and I'd love to read more by this author."}, {"userName": "Michelle Castaneda", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58270976-michelle-castaneda", "userReview": "Dog Tags by Heidi Glick is the story of combat veteran Mark Graham who now teaches at a local community college and co-owns a bait shop. In this story, his path crosses with Beth Martindale, the younger sister of his deceased comrade. Mark tries his best to stay away from Beth for many reasons, but he quickly becomes involved in protecting her from a serial killer that has her as his next target. Dog Tags is a well told story of loss and regrets and its plot moves quickly to an exciting conclusion. I would recommend this as a fun beach read. It was well worth reading, although somewhat predictable.

The story opens with the Knight, a serial killer brooding over his latest victim and planning the next woman to \u2018rescue\u2019. Throughout the story, we are gradually shown more of this man\u2019s character, thought life and his past. Aside from the Knight, one of the other main characters is Mark Graham, a lecturer at a local college. He was previously a corporal in the military but retired after he was injured in an attack that killed his best friend. Mark is now confined to a wheelchair and in addition to his lecturing, he runs Fishy Business \u2013 a fishing tackle shop \u2013 with a couple of friends from the military. Mark is learning to cope again when Beth Martindale erupts into his life. She seems familiar but he can\u2019t quite place her\u2026. and then he realises that she is the kid sister of his best friend.Mark fights against getting too close to Beth, afraid she will trigger off some of his PTSD symptoms, and fearful that she will learn what really happened that fateful night when her brother was killed.Beth, too, has her secrets to hide and tries to keep her distance from Mark. Why is she so determined to keep a certain high school year book from him? Who was her secret admirer?All this time, the Knight is in the background, keeping a watchful eye on Beth, determined to rescue her from the man in the wheelchair. Who is this mysterious Knight? Why has he chosen Beth? And how does he know so much about Mark and Beth? Could he be someone that they both know and trust\u2026?I thoroughly enjoyed this book, which kept me avidly turning the pages. I was a little disappointed by the ending which I felt could have perhaps been stronger. But, overall, it was a great read and I hope that Heidi Glick will write more books because I would definitely buy them.I am grateful to Heidi Glick for providing me with a free copy of Dog Tags for the purpose of writing this unbiassed review."}, {"userName": "Anne Campbell", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2866526-anne-campbell", "userReview": "Dog Tags is a romantic suspense, and it will keep you in suspense, trust me. The characters evolve into three-dimensional heroes, heroines, and villains through their thoughts and actions--although sometimes you wonder which are villains and which are heros.Mark Graham was a Marine Corporal, and he'd been injured trying to save the life of his best friend, Chris Martindale. He'd been too late, though, and he becomes wheelchair bound.Beth Martindale comes face-to-face with the man who'd been her school days crush, her brother's best friend. She'd been too young for him then, but now? She's a 26-year-old teacher; he's a 31-year-old college professor. Now, if she can just get him to understand she's no longer a child, she might have a chance with him.And then there's the Knight. He wants to save her. Guys in wheelchairs are dangerous, like his stepfather was. And if she resists being rescued? Well, she just better not.Mark suffers from a guilty conscience and now a fear of not being able to keep Beth from being hurt by the Knight. He hadn't been able to save Chris.

I found the characters engaging and interesting. The premise of a romance between a veteran who was injured in a failed attempt to save the life of his best friend and that his friends younger sister is as stilted and humorous as you might imagine. It's a lot like playing bumper cars in the dark. You just never quite know where you are in relation to the other person.However, I was disappointed in the suspense department. The threat from the knight just lurks in the background for most of the book. I would have preferred a more balanced approach to the story and had the knight and the suspense he promised be a larger portion of the book."}, {"userName": "Ginger Solomon", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7571247-ginger-solomon", "userReview": "It took me several chapters to get into this book, and I considered putting it down.
