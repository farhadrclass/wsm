Ten years ago, Lucas Blackthorn and his father walked away from society and into the Boundary Waters and were never seen again. That is until Lucas was found while breaking into an outfitters store. Lucas appears to be non-communicative and is placed in a psychiatric hospital for treatment and observation.Maya Stark is a language therapist who works in the psychiatric facility where Lucas is placed. She has a troubled past - her Mother abandoned her, and as a teen she spent some time in a psychiatric facility herself. She is asked to evaluate Lucas and although he initially refuses to talk about his father or the ten years they were missing, he does form a bond with Maya.This book proved to be a fast read for me. There are so many questions at the beginning of this book - why did Maya's mother leave? Why was Maya hospitalized? Where were Lucas and his father for the last ten years? Where is his father now? Why is Lucas not talking? etc. There are some twists and turns along the way, with a few revelations to keep things interesting and the characters and readers wondering what is going to happen (or be revealed) next.As Maya connects to Lucas, she tries to find the answers to the above questions but finds that sometimes knowing all the answers comes with a price. I will admit, I am still not sure how I feel about the ending of this book. I did take some issue with the transference in this book. Anyone who has ever worked in the Mental Health field can tell you about the dangers of transference. True, she was not a Mental Health worker, but she did work in a psychiatric facility and the rules do apply. I also saw a lot of red flags regarding moral, ethical and legal issues concerning her behavior. But I was happy to see some of those addressed in the end of this book.So, the ending, everyone gets answers but there is the one thing that did not sit right with me. I would be giving away spoilers if I say why, I am interested if anyone feels the same way. I will say I enjoyed this book right up until the end, then it went a little downhill for me.Thank you to Atria Books and NetGalley who provided me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.Read more of my reviews at www.openbookpost.com"}, {"userName": "Larry H", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5872506-larry-h", "userReview": "4.5 stars here.Ten years ago Josiah Blackthorn took his nine-year-old son Lucas camping in the Boundary Waters, an area of northern Minnesota full of forests and ice-cold lakes. One day it appeared their campsite was ravaged by bears or other creatures, and the two were never heard from again. Once media interest died down, the Blackthorns were all but forgotten.Until a night 10 years later, when now-19-year-old Lucas Blackthorn was apprehended trying to rob an outfitter store. He became aggressive and violent, and was uncommunicative, so he was sent to the local psychiatric hospital for observation. Both the doctors and law enforcement want to know what happened to Lucas' father, but he refuses to talk\u2014to everyone except Maya Stark, the new, young assistant speech therapist, who seems to engender reactions from the once-lost no-longer-a-boy.While at first her interactions with Lucas are mainly keeping him from hurting her and others, Maya begins to build what she belies is a genuine connection with him. She can't explain why he feels like he can trust only her, and she can't quite determine where she crossed the line from acting in a professional capacity to wanting him to be able to find his father, without having to go through law enforcement. She knows he doesn't need speech therapy; what he needs is a protector, an ally, and despite warnings from her supervisor and her father, she's determined to be that ally.The thing is, Maya has issues of her own. Her mother abandoned their family when she was a teenager, and she's spent a number of years blaming herself, as if she wasn't enough or right for her mother. And that's not the only secret Maya is hiding.\"What lies beneath us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.\"Will Maya do the right thing, if she can figure out what that is? Will her single-minded determination to help Lucas put her in danger? Will helping him get her the answers she has been seeking to her own questions, or will her decisions end in disaster?In \nLeave No Trace\n, Mindy Mejia has given us a taut, compelling exploration of the pull of family and the need to be understood. I devoured this book, and while there were certain twists I expected, she threw in some surprises here and there. I found these characters fascinating and even a little unique, and while certainly I questioned Maya's judgment, I could see how past events in her life could lead her to make the choices she did.Sure, not everything in this book is realistic. But you could see why the characters were compelled to do what they did, and how certain events unfolded. The coincidences and other things didn't bother me. I was hooked from start to finish.I really enjoyed Mejia's last book, \nEverything You Want Me to Be\n (see my review), and with \nLeave No Trace\n she proves she's capable of something completely different. She's definitely an author I'll continue to watch with great anticipation, because no matter the genre, she's immensely talented!NetGalley and Atria Books provided me an advance copy of the book in exchange for an unbiased review.

In this outing she gives us a very different book but with equally compelling characters.The blurb gives a great snapshot of the story so I won\u2019t get into the plot too much. The MC\u2019s are 2 damaged people who have more in common than you initially think. Maya Stark is a speech therapist at Congdon Psychiatric Facility. Her youth, innovative style & maroon hair set her apart. She lives with her dad Brian who really wishes she worked somewhere else. Especially after her\u2026em\u2026spot of trouble a few years back. Lucas Blackthorne is Congdon\u2019s infamous new resident. After vanishing with his father 10 years ago, his sudden reappearance has caused quite a stir. The media & groupies are camped out at the gates waiting to hear his story but Lucas isn\u2019t talking. Then he meets Maya. And one struggling outsider recognizes another. Don\u2019t go into this expecting a thrill-a-minute ride. There are moments of action but that\u2019s not what this is about. Like the previous book, it\u2019s about the characters & the effect of the ripples they cause as they pass through each other\u2019s lives. On one hand, it\u2019s a compelling mystery as we slowly learn the MC\u2019s histories. On the other, it touches on deeper themes such as family, loss, memories & the grey area around right vs. wrong. Strong secondary characters flesh out the story as we follow Maya & Lucas on their deeply personal search to understand the past. The last quarter has some reveals that may make you rethink what you thought you knew. And while a couple of them may stretch disbelief a teensy bit, it\u2019s all part of the journey in this strong, well written tale."}, {"userName": "Dorie", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16912659-dorie", "userReview": "\u201cLeave No Trace\u201d was quite different from \u201cEverything You Want Me To Be\u201d but it shared one shining quality, strong, well developed, deeply troubled characters that I desperately wanted to help. Here are some of the key points of the story.Maya Stark is a young woman who has been through a lot in her relatively young life. Abandoned by her mother at the age of 10 without a goodbye or an explanation, Maya has been searching for an explanation for years. She has a great relationship with her father who is gone quite a bit for his job, they share a house and seem to give each other the support and yet the space that they both need.Lucas Blackthorn is a young man who was believed to have been killed during a camping expedition with his father in the Boundary Waters of Minnesota. There has been no word from father or son for ten years. Then one night a young man believed to be Lucas enters an outfitter\u2019s store where he commits a crime for which he is apprehended. Getting no response from Lucas upon interviewing him they feel he is emotionally unstable and he is admitted to a psychiatric facility. It is here where the paths of Maya and Lucas come together. Maya had turned her life around after battling mental illness herself and is now a trained speech therapist. Her mentor and boss, Dr.Mehta, assigns Maya to Lucas\u2019s case. She feels that since Maya had also suffered a loss perhaps she could get through to Lucas, get information about where he has been for the past ten years. The police are also interested in whether his father is still alive and where he is hiding, they have been searching the vast area of the Boundary Waters for years with never a trace found.Once Maya and Lucas do form a bond she is determined to help him recover and be allowed the freedom that he so desires. They share each others stories and secrets and become very attached. Lucas tries to escape several times but he is always apprehended.That\u2019s about all of the plot that I will share but there is a very good story here with plenty of twists that you won\u2019t see coming and an ending that will surprise you.The author\u2019s strength is definitely in her fully developed characters which make you want to keep turning pages and to care deeply how the story wraps up for Lucas and Maya.I received an ARC of this novel from the publisher through Edelweiss, thank you"}, {"userName": "Jamie Rosenblit", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2364302-jamie-rosenblit", "userReview": "Intriguing suspense story with a bit of a wilderness aspect which creates a unique setting.

I was immediately pulled into the story and wanted to know why Lucas was missing for all those years.Maya works at a psychiatric facility as an assistant speech therapist. She previously worked there as an orderly and was once a patient. Maya is asked to work with Lucas Blackthorn. Lucas is a nineteen and disappeared ten years ago after going camping with is dad.

After reading it, I decided that I'd read any story that Mindy Mejia chooses to tell. Her writing is engaging, and her characters are layered, messed up, but relatable because you can see a small part of yourself in each person. She also weaves an elaborate and descriptive backstory to help you understand each characters wants, needs, motivations, and desires.Leave No Trace is a story about abandonment, nature, love, family, mental health, and the ties that bind us, sprinkled with a little bit of geology. It is fast paced, action packed, full of complex characters, and very well written. It makes me want to be outdoors, be one with nature, go camping and sleep under the stars. Leave No Trace is completely different from Mindy Mejia's last book, Everything You Want Me To Be, but it's just as good. The plots are polar opposites, but both books share the same qualities that make them must-reads, and shows how talented the author is at storytelling.

Warning: this review contains spoilers.What I liked: the writing is good and the story is engaging. For the most part, I found Maya (the protagonist) and the mental hospital plot line believable (and as someone who works in the field for years, I am super picky about how these things are portrayed in fiction). And then...well, I feel like the author lost me with Lucas Blackthorn. He just wasn't as believable as a person who had lived off the grid and away from civilization for 10 years. The romance with Maya was a little forced, in my opinion, and the daring escape from the psych hospital was just too dramatic and far-fetched. The ending, with the couple living happily ever after, didn't do it for me - again, I just felt unrealistic.

Breaking her love interest out of a max security \u201clost soul lockup\u201d shows not only the courage but the deviousness of Maya and her total disregard for the laws and moral norms of society, gotta admire that gal.

I bring this up because this book has a lot of content about geology, the vast and unspoiled sections of wilderness still accessible in the United States, and people who love the outdoors. None of those things are appealing to me on a personal level. I hate camping, I assume that most vast wildernesses are hiding either dangerous creatures or serial killers, and while I like looking at the pretty rocks, geology has always been a bit of a snooze for me.But I still really enjoyed this book.I like the way Mejia writes, and I like how she carefully builds her themes. More than the central ideas of family, the questions about belonging reach out into the complicated world of social norms and mental health as well. Maya is vastly different from me, and while sometimes it's nice, important even, for the books we read to serve as a mirror, instead the offered me the opportunity to walk in someone else's shoes. There are a couple of small mysteries in the story, but as I read I was so involved in the questions of mental health and why society is so unhappy and distrustful of people who opt out of being a part of society, that it was more of an added bonus as a mystery fan than then reason why I was reading the book.I did appreciate that I read \"The Stranger in the Woods\" when that came out last year, intrigued more by why than how someone would want to disappear and live off the grid and that served as a great piece of additional context before reading this book. So if you're looking for some reading before the September release date of this book, it would definitely enhance your reading experience.Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for allowing me to read an advanced copy of the book in exchange for a fair and honest review."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/885697-melissa", "userReview": "Hmm... while I guess this is classified as a thriller, for me it was more of a slow burning mystery then the fast-paced thrillers I'm used to.

Ten years ago a man and his son trekked into this wilderness and never returned.Search teams found their campsite ravaged by what looked like a bear. They were presumed dead until a decade later...the son appeared. Discovered while ransacking an outfitter store, he was violent and uncommunicative and sent to a psychiatric facility.
