I know my eyes are still red from crying as I finished this book this morning before heading to work. Obviously that was not a good choice but what do you do? This is a book so full of courage and love that my words won't do it justice. Bryce Courtenay writes his son's story of growing up as a haemophiliac who acquires AIDS from a blood transfusion during the time when AIDS was just hitting the news in the states. Damon grew up in Australia so no one really new what it was all about until it was too late and it was already in the blood banks. Damon's attitude thoughout his 24 years of living with thousands of blood transfusions and an endless amount of sickness of one form or another is amazing! When he is in his late teens he meets Celeste, another teenager and the love that grows between them is one you just don't hear about. She becomes his world and he becomes hers. This book took me through many emotions, including sadness, but it was also an inspiration in so many ways. I highly recommend it.Bryce is one of my favorite authors and even though this was a true story (non-fiction is just not my favorite)he always weaves a tale that sweeps you up and draws you inside."}, {"userName": "Jennifer (JC-S)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/283014-jennifer-jc-s", "userReview": "\u2018Trust Damon to die on April Fool\u2019s Day.\u2019Damon Courtenay was born on 4 November 1966, and died on 1 April 1991. This is his story, written by his father and published in 1993. Damon was the third son of Bryce and Benita Courtenay and was born with classic haemophilia. \u2018Its not a disease, so you must put the idea of a cure from your minds immediately. Haemophilia is caused by a factor missing in your child\u2019s blood, the ingredient which causes it to clot.\u2019\u2018It\u2019s not something we can ever fix.\u2019 In 1983, the Courtenays were advised that Damon had become HIV positive \u2013 most likely because of the blood transfusions he had required to treat his haemophilia. In 1988, he experienced his first real AIDS-related crisis after undergoing surgery for the removal of his wisdom teeth.\u2018I picked up the AIDS virus from the blood product that I use regularly for control of haemophilia. It seems such a bitter irony that the medicine that has saved my life became the poison that may soon end it.\u2019It was indeed a bitter irony, and Damon\u2019s story is a heartbreaking one. But it is not bereft of joy or of love.I have had this book on my bookshelf for 17 years: I knew, broadly, what the book was about but couldn\u2019t bring myself to read it until recently. And now that I have read it, I am saddened by the medical circumstances: of haemophilia; of its treatment and of the fact that the source of Damon\u2019s AIDS appears to have been a consequence of contaminated blood donations. A blood donation process \u2013 since changed - which did not exclude groups at high risks of AIDS infection from donating blood.I found this book moving and upsetting. It describes both the best and the worst of the medical profession: many dedicated people helped Damon even though the medical system itself seemed to move very slowly in recognising the need for change to its processes and systems. Damon Courtenay may have lived a brief life, but one consequence of it is, as I discovered, a perpetual trust fund (the Damon Courtenay Memorial Endowment Fund administered by the Haemophilia Fund Australia) which provides grants that can be used for the care, treatment, education and welfare for people with bleeding disorders and (or) their families. This fund was established by Damon\u2019s parents in 1993 in Damon\u2019s memory.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"}, {"userName": "Jenny", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3501645-jenny", "userReview": "I actually read this book about 25 years ago... but it is a book that will never leave me.I still temember the absolute power of the book and my utter devaststion when I finished reading. it took me on such a rollercoaster ride and made me realise another side of life that I was fortunate to not have encountered.

I understand that it is an attempt to make sense of the death of a greatly loved son, but 639 pages filled at times with the minutiae of serious illness does become a challenge to finish. It is also somewhat dated now, but does serve to show us how things have changed in both attitudes to, and treatment of HIV/AIDS. Hopefully for the better.

This was a long read for me and an incredibly arduous yet loving journey for the marvelous family of Damon Courtenay. To have a son born a hemophiliac is beyond daunting. I had no idea about all of the spontaneous bleeds of a hemophiliac nor the resulting physical deterioration in the body. The \"mother\" part of me reading this book wept openly. How did these parents continue to find their needed strength both physically and emotionally? Add an AIDS contaminated transfusion to the mix and life really becomes challenging. One reviewer I read wrote:\"This isn't a book you actually \"enjoy\" but it is an important book. It is the book Damon asked his father to write, to instruct people about AIDS and, he hoped, reduce some of the stigma attached to AIDS victims. (Damon died in a time when you were expected to wear gowns, gloves and masks when entering the room of someone with AIDS) You will laugh, you will cry and you will scream at too many in the medical community who made things terrible for Damon at various points in his life, from babyhood all the way up to his death.\" So why read this tribute to a dead son? For me it was the empathy I feel and the beginning bud of understanding of this terrible condition. There were so many obstacles: ignorance, depression, seizures, pain, loneliness, but these elements were blended with the dedication of a devoted lover (Celeste), generous and caring doctors (at the end of Damon's life), a profound belief in the power of the mind, an unquenchable attitude of gratitude and a zest for life. My challenges seem smaller now. My life is abundantly rich and full. This well-loved author \"barred his soul\" if you will and in so doing touched mine."}, {"userName": "Brian", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1778081-brian", "userReview": "The Power of One by Bryce Courtenay is one of my favorite books of all time, but since he's not big in the U.S., it's difficult to find other books by him. I found April Fool's Day in a used book store, and was excited to read it.This was a great book, but not in the traditional sense. It's got the same great story-telling feel that Power of One had, but it's completely different because this is the true story of his son Damon's struggle with haemophilia. To stop his \"bleeds\" he needed regular blood transfusions to stay alive, which ironically ultimately killed him as he contracted HIV from one.Some parts of this book were tough to read, and I had to put it down a few times and take a mental break. The effects of Damon's diseases were so awful and the thought of watching a family member go through that was pretty terrible. It's amazing to me that Bryce Courtenay was able to write this book with all the painful memories it must have brought up.I almost feel like the title of his debut novel \"The Power of One\" would have been more fitting for this novel. Despite the horrible fortune dealt to Damon from the moment he was born with haemophilia and later AIDS, he never wanted to be a burden on his family or his girlfriend Celeste. He faced each day with a positive outlook and always believed he could beat his diseases eventually and made huge plans for his future, and he never complained about the immense pain he was constantly enduring. He had an inner strength that is rare for anyone, let alone someone who was dealt such a bad hand.Overall, a great story. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is very sensitive as the story is very honest and the effects of the diseases were disturbing. It will change your outlook on people suffering from AIDS and make you thankful for having your health, something we all take for granted every day."}, {"userName": "B the BookAddict", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19832827-b-the-bookaddict", "userReview": "Courtney at his most honest and his best. \u2605 5"}, {"userName": "Liza Fireman", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28266634-liza-fireman", "userReview": "Wow, wow, and ouch ouch ouch. This book is full of pain, it is heart wrenching. It is the story of Bryce Courtenay's son, Damon, that died at the age of 24, after 24 tough years. Damon was a hemophiliac, and to say the truth, I found out that I know almost nothing about hemophilia. What is a bleeding (well, you can't even see the blood), how it is treated (several blood transfusions every week), how limited is a child with hemophilia, and what are the \"longer\" affects on the body, that is deteriorating and losing even its limited freedom.Now add to that HIV/AIDS, and you got more pain, that cannot be contained. And then, I found out that I don't know too much about AIDS either. So that was eye opening, in the most painful way possible. But it is so very important to know more about it. And at least we made some progress and some of the prejudices have improved.But above all, it is a story about love and dedication. The true love between Damon and Celeste, his girlfriend, and her amazing dedication. And the Courtenays dedication, 24/7, since this is what hemophilia means. And love and dedication play a big role in terminal illness, and they helped the Mighty Damon in almost impossible states, not leaving him for a moment, even when it seems impossible to continue. It is a hard book, but I believe it is the best book to allow somewhat to understand what a terminal ill person goes through. And Bryce Courtenay succeeds to bring it both from the point of view of the family and of the ill person. I can't even describe how I felt throughout some parts, especially when Damon was on the verge of death, in tough life risking states. Heart wrenching, but so so important. You'll learn a lot about hemophilia and AIDS (and about irresponsible medical systems). I don't think that loved the book is a good description, but my heart was expanded (and shrunk at times) by reading it. I ached for the Courtenay family.(4.5 stars but I'll go with the 5 here)"}, {"userName": "Bev", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4806357-bev", "userReview": "Damon was dead. The book starts with his death, so there is no surprise at the outcome. This is the story of Damon Courtney, a hemopheliac who contracted AIDS from a blood transfusion and died at age 24. It is beautifully and sensitively told by his father, one of Australia's best known writers, his girlfriend Crystal, and his mother. I learned more about hemophelia and AIDS than I ever knew and at the end I was sobbing at Damon's death. This isn't a book you actually \"enjoy\" but it is an important book. It is the book Damon asked his father to write, to instruct people about AIDS and, he hoped, reduce some of the stigma attached to AIDS victims.

My friend Steve nearly died in 1996, but then new drugs came along and now Steve and countless others are living with AIDS rather than dying from it.

I found myself skipping a lot of digressions and trivia. This is not of course a commentary on the life, pain and experiences the family went through, which are touching in an exceptional way. The amount of medical malpractice they went through is infuriating and saddening. For myself, I simply prefer more conciseness and deliberate focus when it comes to carving a path or a perspective through a story. Depositing everything into a huge mass comes across as tedious sometimes. From a reader's perspective, selective detail would have been more powerful, I think, emphasizing the craftsmanship of the novel over completeness. But of course the book was written first and foremost as the fulfillment of a promise and secondly as a necessary act of memory for the author.

Thank god the drugs have improved so that those who are HIV+ can live a long life. It was interesting to learn about haemophilia and how difficult a disease it is to manage. My grandfather was apparently a bleeder, but unless it was a very mild case, I am not sure he even had it now. Learning about the way AIDS kills was horrific. I feel so sorry for the poor people dying of this disease. I hope that the medical community learned its lesson and if some other disease appears in blood, they will have a better risk plan in place. To think that the poor haemophiliac community who were already having a shit life shortened by their disease, had to then die horrifically, as well as being ostracised by the community.

Sadly it is a true story about his young son who developed AID\u2019s as a result of an infected blood transfusion, which he received because of his hemophiliac disease. The story is set in Australia, his native home. The narrative is told from different perspectives...Bryce, the father, the mother, the victim Damon and his girlfriend, Celeste. Each adds their own voice to the unfolding of this deadly disease.It is a sad tale, written in memory of Damon, to be an expose on the lacking state of the medical system in Australia at the time. Although the medical system should have known better, they did not take adequate care by banning AID\u2019s patients from donating blood, as other countries had already done. In addition, AID\u2019s was almost treated like the plague, where you were an outcast. Courtney openly admits that it was still easier on Damon who contracted AID\u2019s through medical treatment and not his sexual lifestyle. Nonetheless, Courtney manages to capture the blatant ostracism of anyone with AIDS. I enjoyed reading the book and felt moved as a parent to bear witness to the life and struggles of Damon. His strength dealing with life as a childhood hemophiliac was inspiring. The unfairness of developing AIDS was heart-wrenching and sharing the journey with Damon\u2019s girlfriend, siblings and parents was at times hard to read, but that was because the writing was so poignant that there was little left to the imagination as to their true feelings. Damon\u2019s mother was openly honest as she admitted to being angry and totally raw with grief. Courtney was brave enough to admit that he may have put the writing of his current book ahead of flying home with the family when Damon was so sick.I would recommend this book highly as creative non-fiction. It not only educates you on hemophilia and AID\u2019s but also shares a powerful love story of not only the couple, but of Damon\u2019s brother and parents. It is a sad story, but one that needed to be told. The writing compels you to keep turning the pages.

I felt privileged to be brought into the journey as Bryce, (and other family members), shared their joys, sorrows, triumphs and griefs in the midst of a very difficult circumstance.
