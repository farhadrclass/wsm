I recommend it to those curious about a Jewish Belgian family's experiences during WW2. It reads as a book for young adults. It begins with the German occupation of Belgium, the initial bombing in Brussels and then it follows two families' flight to southern France. They are hidden by Huguenots in Languedoc, France. This is a novel, but is based on the author's family. The book is interesting, filled with all sorts of diverse details. It is about life in rural southern France during the war years. Historical war facts are related, but the emphasis is on how these events played out in France. How the French people helped the refugees, how the villagers and the hidden Jews survived on a day to day basis, what they ate, how they were clothed, the harvesting of chestnuts, the French Resistance, all these topics are covered by following the two Belgian families. The main emphasis is the little things of daily life. I found it interesting because I currently live in Belgium and spend much time in France. I have visited the villages spoken of. I believe this has increased my appreciation; a person who has not visited the towns of southern France may be less enthused.Yes,there are diverse tidbits that are interesting, at least for me!The writing is simplistic. It reads as YA literature. There are four children in the families. The children's perspectives are covered as well as the adults'. The narration by David Baker wasn't fantastic. The story is simple to follow in the audio format, the characters remain constant. Each chapter has both a title and a date, one event following the next in chronological order. Nothing is confusing. Baker did add voice intonations for the different characters and even one had a lisp that you could always recognize. What was wrong was that some of the words were either incorrectly written or incorrectly pronounced. For example, the French word \"merveilleux\" was pronounced \"marveilleux\". Was it written wrong or incorrectly pronounced? Some words were just not correct! Yeah, the book was interesting, but no big winner. Maybe more interesting to me since I live in Belgium and love France!"}, {"userName": "Charlie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2808380-charlie", "userReview": "Lynmar Brock, Jr. creates an intimate portrait of a family's history during WWII. In This Hospitable Land details the hardships experienced by the Severin family. The expansive time they suffered is astounding and their determination to survive, memorable. Historians and those readers with a particular interested in WWII (1940's) will find this a good read. However, the casual historical reading audience might discover the length grueling, daily life repetitive and despite the events, lacking in anticipation. I compare the experience to thumbing through someone else's family photo album or watching home movies. The past is interesting and you get to know the characters, but I felt kept at an arms length and was unable to fully invest. It seemed as if the author was still protecting the privacy of the family and by doing so, I became merely an observer during the journey. For example, when a terrible violation happens to the young girls at school, the matter is given a few sentences and the reaction of parents even less. It was greatly 'breezed' over and took me a bit by surprise. It is an unpleasant topic to dwell on and most families would wish not to discuss. I found myself wondering why more type space was given to describing the slaughter of an animal than to the trauma of these little girls? Perhaps by attempting to be sensitive to private matters, the author was insensitive to revealing a true horror that might have provided a deeper intimacy.Note: My copy was an ARC and contained 604 pages."}, {"userName": "Sandy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2113445-sandy", "userReview": "This self-published book, historical fiction by category, is an interesting look into the plight/flight of a Jewish family at the beginning of WW II.

The removal of a university professor and his immediate and extended family from Brussels to the south of France and a mountain farm with no plumbing was interesting on several levels. The adaptation of this urban, educated family to a farming life and participation in the French Resistance was pivotal to the plot.

Of Jewish ancestry, the Sauverin family flees Belgium just ahead of the Nazi occupation. The family drives to France, where they are initially welcomed. However, France soon becomes occupied by the German army forcing the family to flee further to the south of France. They settle in a mountainous, rugged farming community living among the descendants of the French Huguenots. Amid the turmoil for their survival, the family transitions from city dwellers to farmers working well with neighbors in the struggle for daily survival. The strong resilient French resistance welcomes and accepts the family, sheltering the children and parents among their neighbors, at great risk of their own lives. What makes this book compelling is the French Resistance movement, which both Sauverin brothers, Alex and Andre, become members. The courage of the resistance members at all levels, amid what may appear to be invincible odds, was inspiring. This book was very enlightening and a testament to the courage of those who resist oppression at the expense of their own lives. As a novel however, the characters developed very slowly, exhibiting flat conversations for the first third of the book. Careful editing could have eliminated redundant information or helped the writer fully develop his characters early on. From midway through the book, the characters become real and you feel as if you cannot put the book down until you see what happens to them. Following the book, the author tells what happened to Alex's family, but does not tell the reader what happened to the descendants of Andre, who remains in France. This book is an interesting read for those who like detailed historical fiction. It reveals the strength and courage of the French people in the face of insurmountable odds. With careful editing, this book could be a best seller of 5 star rank in the lines of Sarah's Key."}, {"userName": "PennsyLady (Bev)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12364449-pennsylady-bev", "userReview": "3.5 \u2605---In This Hospitable Land is a moving WW2 adventure that begins in Brussels, Belgium on May 10, 1940 and ends in Brussels on October 9, 1944.Based on one family's harrowing true survival story,we find factual account of a Jewish family (Severin), forced from their home in Belgium during the Nazi invasion of Europe in World War II.\"Members of the Severin family fled the Wehrmacht\u2019s invasion and ultimately settled in the Cevennes area of rural southern France only to find themselves caught between occupied German soldiers, suspicious townsfolk, and the local pro-Nazi Vichy government.The family, trapped in the middle of this chaos, is forced to depend upon already wary neighbors to hide them from possible capture by the Nazis.\"The grateful Severin brothers join up with the resistance fighters of the Maquis and the story evolves.-----------------Biography reveals that Lynmar Brock, Jr. married one of the little girls.\"Having married a girl from Belgium who arrived in the US in 1950 I was really interested in her family for my own sake and as much as for our two sons.I wanted them to know of their mother's story.....getting married in 1963, Claudie and I sat down with her father and aunt and uncle and recorded five hours of conversation about the war years.\"Events depicted are real.Dialog reflects family and other French residents who engaged in the events discussed.(quoted material is from overview and the author's biographical information.)"}, {"userName": "Don", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/750659-don", "userReview": "Very interesting read. The story is a WWII survival story of one non-practicing Jewish family from Belgium and how they are protected in the south of France by various locals. The writing style is interesting, as large gaps of time are passed from chapter to chapter to carry the story from approximately 1940 to 1945; and much of the dialogue can be randomly intense and deep, and almost seems like someone's more internal thoughts. As the story was based on real history, with some name changes, it almost seemed like some of the dialogue was really from an individual's diary and the author incorporated into the story. I point this out because I found it unique, and somewhat surprisingly, not at all frustrating or annoying; rather, on the contrary, I felt it gave the book an extra quality for appreciating the seriousness and intensity of the time being portrayed. As with so many of stories involving the Jewish experience during WWII, and books involving Wars in general, it is easy to become disgusted at the depravity of what humans will do to one another, and dismayed at the terrible choices one must make to survive and protect one's family. However, it also reveals great strength and courage on the part of many individuals, who sacrificed much and risked more to protect innocent people from evil. Excellent read, and like so much good historical fiction, helps brings the raw emotion and the reality of the time period to the reader."}, {"userName": "Bookreaderljh", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1632972-bookreaderljh", "userReview": "This novel reads like a true story and it is based on one. It tells of two Belgium Jewish brothers Andre and Alex and their families as they escape from Belgium and pursuit by Nazi Germany throughout WWII. The brothers and their families end up in occumpied France and hide in the rural outposts by making a living as farmers - a much different life from their intellectual, middle class lives in Brussels. At first they are able to keep their families together (parents, wives, children) but as the war goes on they need to split up as they are hiddent by French resisters in Southern France. The brothers end up joining the Resistance and using their skills to help fight but at a cost to their beliefs and their families. Alex's family basically disappears from the narrative about half way through (which was a little disconcerting) but Andre's story and family is more developed. Amazing that they are protected by virtual strangers and are able to survive which most of the family left behind did not. The writing gets bogged down in spots and the story sometimes is a little too mundane but the book does speak to the atrocities of the war (on both sides) as the war progresses. A large theme is Andre's pacifism and interesting to note in the epilogue that the families move to the US and become Quakers. Not many books on these small stories of resistance and protection inside Vichy France and the life is described well with a large cast of ordinary people as characters."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3771119-julie", "userReview": "I was debating whether to give this book three or four stars, but I really think it deserves praise for its subject. This is a captivating aspect of WWII, featuring Belgian refugees exiled to Nazi occupied France, the hospitality they encounter in the remote mountain villages of the southern country, and their role in the Resistance. I was previously unaware of the political upheaval in France during Germany\u2019s control, the complacency of the Vichy government, and the role of simple peasants in harboring fugitives and supporting the defiant rebels.I wanted to give this book more praise because of the rich historical detail, the realistic and sympathetic characters, and the great atmosphere. However, the writing was pedestrian, the dialogue bordered on absurd, and there were so many mundane details that could have been omitted to make the book shorter and more fast-paced. Although, another reason I opted for four stars is because Amazon Encore plays a pivotal role in giving authors good exposure, which I think this book deserves. Sure, it had its flaws, but it was decent historical fiction (though based on true events) and its positives outweighed the negatives. I received a complimentary copy of this book via the Amazon Vine program."}, {"userName": "Debbie Shoulders", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3813995-debbie-shoulders", "userReview": "Inspired by real events, Brock attempts to tell the true story of the Juliard family. Two brothers married two sisters and led a middle class life in Brussels until Hitler's bombs made life unbearable.Andre, a chemistry professor helped his family realize that they must leave for France. Through a set of luck and good instincts, the families ended up in the Cevennes, a mountainous area in south central France. The region was a refuge for the Protestant Huguenots, a group who suffered at the hands of the Catholic Church for several hundred years. This background made the people tolerant of individual beliefs. Though Jewish by heritage, the Juliards did not practice their faith. This made no difference in the Nazi racial laws. Andre's brother Alex was good with farming and the two were able to offer their talents to help others in the small hamlets in which they hid. Ultimately the brothers who tended toward passive beliefs became part of the French resistance.The book is a day-by-day, year-by-year account of their efforts to survive but presented rather dryly.

It moved me to read more about the Huguenots and the type of caring people they were and what they went through. I was unfamiliar with what happened in this region during WWII. The faith story of Andre is interesting. How he struggled with being a pacifist and yet fighting for his family and people of the region. Coming to terms with ideas and ways of life for the family. Alex and the wives adjusted and changed for the better. Their openness to work hard and become farmers of the land, to become members of that community. They loved that land.
