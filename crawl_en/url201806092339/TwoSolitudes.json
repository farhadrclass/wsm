Part of the annual ritual was a trip to Montreal and Quebec, only a few hours drive across the border. McGill University and the shrine of St. Anne de Beaupre were the unexceptional tourist standards. But what a shock to me - a country in which people could understand English but wouldn't speak it; a country of some vague but pervasive hostility; perhaps most remarkably a Catholic country which wore its religion as a weapon, whether defensive or offensive I could not tell. But it was certainly different; and yet the Appalachian Mountains of New York were visible from the skyscrapers of Montreal.Two Solitudes is about the tension between French Canadians and their English-speaking compatriots at just about the time I became inarticulately aware of it. Little known to me at the time, matters had reached such a state as to threaten the national unity of Canada. Ten years later, secession of Quebec from the Confederation was a real political prospect until at least some of the issues MacLennan touches - official language, ethnic discrimination, the role of the Church in politics, for example - had been addressed.I took an extended camping trip through Eastern Canada, mostly the Gaspe peninsula and the Acadian shore of New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island in 2002. My expectation was, given the absence of international news about Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois separatists, that the reforms of the 1960's had been more or less effective. I was therefore shocked to discover overt hostility to English-speaking visitors and the frequent presence of Acadian independence flags all around the coast.This experience reminded me of one of the most remarkable traits of Canada that isn't shared with its neighbour to the South: cultural continuity. Like the United States, Canada of course is a country of immigrants, and therefore to some degree a 'melting pot'. But in Canada what's in the pot is much less homogeneous and maintains much more of the national flavours of its first white settlers. MacLennan's characters are often frustrated by the Canadian penchant for resolving a problem, specifically the inequity experienced by French Canadians, by ignoring it. Canadians, the reader is led to believe, tend, in a very English way, to muddle through, to make small, incremental, half-hearted attempts at social change. But these same characters despise the absence of cultural continuity and its substitution by greed and ideology in the United States. Given my experience on the Acadian Shore, it strikes me that Canada has indeed found a middle way between the ideological destructiveness of the United States and the political stagnation of pre-WWII ethnic relations in the country. The French-English problem isn't 'solved'. But it's not meant to be. It is too complex to even attempt to fix permanently. Since it evolves, in this case by catalysing isolated French-speaking settlements, it can only be addressed incrementally with enough national energy to keep the whole together without destroying the smaller wholes within it. I don't know if this kind of national social strategy has a name but it appears to be in play in a number of policy areas - First Nation, international relations, immigration, to name only three. And it seems to be a rather effective way to keep the country away from the obvious distress of social trauma and disintegration of its larger neighbour. Appropriately, therefore, while brilliantly describing the existential reality of a multinational country, MacLennan doesn't provide what has come to be called a 'global solution'. Canada, it would seem, has the rare and precious virtue of humility - in its writers as well as its social policy. Or put another way by one of MacLennan's characters, \"Its an odd thing about this country - there are few outright villains.\""}, {"userName": "Stela", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2585926-stela", "userReview": "My ineffable Quebec, my loveQuebec is a magic place. You see it and you are besotted. You live in it and you become addicted. Almost imperceptibly you think of it not only as your home but also as your wonderland. I often wander Montreal\u2019s streets, never tiring to marvel at the people and places\u2019 diversity. Nowhere else in the world the word \u201ccosmopolite\u201d makes more sense than here, furthermore, I almost believe this was the place that originated it, with its incessant scrolling of people from any corner of the world you could think of, with its happy charivari of languages more or less recognizable, with its interesting display of customs and traditions, with its generous, never-ending offer of artistic events. Whatever your mother-tongue, sooner or later you would hear it, in the street, or in a supermarket, or in a theatre foyer. Whatever new the place you happen to come by, sooner or later you meet a friendly face.Therefore, it would seem the last word you could apply to Quebec is solitude. However, it is not paradoxical, not even oxymoronic. And you cannot truly begin to understand Quebec, its history, its aspirations and its very soul if you don\u2019t accept its fundamental dichotomy, result of its perpetual struggle to assert its own identity, its continual need to remind the world but also its own inhabitants that it is a island of French speakers in a sea of English ones. So Europeanly atavistic is this need to define itself, this fear of assimilation despite its so open immigration politics. And so alien for a stranger, even a European like me, who cannot help but sharing the feelings of Paul Tallard, the character with mixed origins in the novel:\u201cDoes it feel funny belonging to both races?\u201d\u201cWell, it makes it impossible to be enthusiastic about the prejudices of either of them, and that can be uncomfortable sometimes.\" Here is one of the reasons I found MacLennan\u2019s book so interesting. It helped me cope with my own incapacity to choose a side or another without feeling like betraying my French-Canadian friends every time I cannot identify with their choices and their views. For it is not a question of taking parts, at least not anymore, it is simply a question of acknowledging that these feelings are an undeniable part of Quebec\u2019s ineffable charm, along with its picturesque places, generous people, undying love for art. Another reason to count Two Solitudes among the great writings of Canadian literature is the creation of a complex and viable and tragic character, Athanase Tallard, born before his times, with a deep understanding of his country, which of course cannot understand him. Not yet. Then there is an amazing reconstruction of a typical catholic village at the beginning of the 19th century, with its closed society suspicious of strangers and gravitating around the priest against whom not even Athanase, whose family had been the most influential in those parts for more than two centuries, can fight. Indeed, it will be Father Beaubien who will trigger, inadvertently, it is true, the ruin of the Tallard family.\u201cWell, Captain\u201d, Athanase said slowly, \u201cthis is just like any other parish in Quebec. The priest keeps a tight hold. Myself, I\u2019m Catholic. Bur I still think the priests hold the people too tightly, (\u2026) Here the Church and the people are almost one and the same thing, and the Church is more than any individual priest\u2019s idea of it.\u201dI agree with all those who observed that the second part of the novel, that follows the destiny of Athanase\u2019s son, Paul, is not as good as the first one. Or maybe it should have been an independent novel, a sequel, maybe, for it harms the unity of the composition by changing tone and direction. Whereas the first part is mainly historical, the second becomes a bildungsroman, sometimes awkwardly constructed. However, there are enough touching scenes and intriguing characters (Heather is one of them, McQueen is another) in this second part also to conclude that even this last dichotomy could count among all the other solitudes in pairs in the book: French/ English, village/ city, male/ female, war/ peace, Canada/ USA, catholic/ protestant, and so on.That  Two Solitudes deservedly gained its place among the the best of Canadian literature it is undeniable. The old-fashioned pace of the narrative, the classic structure and plot-building help to re-create a charming world, whose beliefs, fears and lifestyle have founded the nowadays Qu\u00e9bec."}, {"userName": "Rebecca McNutt", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36977686-rebecca-mcnutt", "userReview": "Two Solitudes is spectacular on so many levels. A true Canadian classic, this book has so much in its pages and is definitely worth reading."}, {"userName": "Keith", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/659583-keith", "userReview": "Hugh MacLennan\u2019s Two Solitudes is an undisputed \u201cclassic\u201d of modern Canadian Literature. It is undoubtedly for that reason that I had never read it. Unfortunately it was not on the syllabus of the one Canadian Literature course I took at university. I now wish it had been. Although it was published sixty-seven years ago, it is fresh and provocative. Indeed, I found it to be mostly a deeply thoughtful and extremely well written novel. Before I read it I considered the \u201ctwo solitudes\u201d of the book to be simply about relations between English and French Canadians. And it is all of that, focusing on the family of Quebec patriarch Athanase Tallard. The Tallard family seat is on land alongside The St. Lawrence River. The Tallards came to Quebec with Frontenac in the 1670s and for nearly three hundred years have epitomized the virtues of rural Quebec \u2013 closeness to the land and the church, a suspicion of outsiders and a contempt for the English; but Athanase has seen the future and it is science and industrialization and his attempts to try to change the village near his country house sets in motion the drama that follows. There are other \u201csolitudes\u201d too; one is that between the village and the city, in Athanase\u2019s case, between Saint-Marc and Montreal. Another space is that between men and women; women play a vital part in the novel, enlivening the whole by their presence and creating complications in the world of city men who want stability and order above all. A fourth solitude is between war and peace. The novel begins in 1917 as the horror of the First World War is grinding to a halt and ends on the day war is declared again, in September 1939. A fifth solitude is between Canadians and Americans. A section of the novel is set in Maine where the Montreal gentry summer in companionship with various Americans of the same class. There is also a vast gulf between Catholics and Protestants, one mostly encompassed by French and English Canadians but even more complex in the case of Athanase\u2019s second wife, Katherine, who is Irish and Catholic. Another theme that was most fascinating about the novel is the role of reading, of writing and of libraries in it. Athanase Tallard has an old and well-stocked library and he wants to write a book about the role of religion in Canadien society. He doesn\u2019t accomplish this but his youngest child, Paul Tallard, works his way through the last third of the novel as a struggling novelist. Indeed the last third could be honestly titled \u201cA Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,\u201d for it is Paul\u2019s education that is paramount here.Finally, one should pay tribute to MacLennan\u2019s lovingly detailed descriptions of the land. This is so much a book about geography, about the specifics of northern geography. This is the first paragraph of the concluding chapter:In that autumn of 1939 the countryside in Canada had never seemed more tranquil. There was golden weather. In Nova Scotia and New Brunswick the moose came out of the forests on October nights and stood in silhouette against the moon-paths that crossed solitary lakes. In Ontario people looked across the water from their old river-towns, and seeing the lights of moving cars in the United States, remembered again that they lived on a frontier that was more a link than a division. On the prairies the combines rolled up the wheat, increasing the surplus in the granaries until it was hard to believe there were enough human mouths in the world to eat it all. In British Columbia the logs came down the rivers; people separated by mountains, plains and an ocean remembered English hamlets, pictured them under bombs, themselves islanded between snow-peaks and the Pacific. The Saint Lawrence, flowing past the old parishes, enfolding the \u00cele d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans and broadening out in the sweep to Tadoussac, passed in sight of forests that flamed with the autumn of 1939: scarlet of rock maples, gold of beeches, heavy green of spruce and fir. Only in the far north on the tundra was the usual process of life abruptly fractured. Prospectors hearing on their portable radios that the world they had left was at war could stand the solitude no longer; they broke camp, walked or paddled hundreds of miles southward, were flown out by bush-pilots, appeared before recruiting stations in Edmonton, Battleford, Brandon, in the nearest organized towns they could find, and faded into the army."}, {"userName": "Adam", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1884982-adam", "userReview": "I thought I'd have more to write about this book's themes and characters &c., but then I read the afterword, by Robert Kroetsch, to this edition, and realized that Kroetsch pretty much says it all in a wonderful short essay. So on I go to the evaluative stuff: Two Solitudes is supposed to be one of the Important Canadian Novels. You'll hear it namedropped on the CBC. Gord Downie might mention it in one of his live, improvised mid-song rants. Academics concerned with Canadian Identity will probably teach it or at least mention it. But, unfortunately, Two Solitudes is, though written beautifully, though impressive in scope, though populated with genuinely interesting and alive characters, Two Solitudes still is one of these self-consciously Canadian books, one of these books that is about Canada and What It Means To Be Canadian. It's really kind of odd, this Canadian Identity stuff. I'm pretty sure the vast majority of the country couldn't give less of a shit about defining Canadian Identity, but on the other hand there's an excruciatingly vocal group, especially in government and academia, it seems, who want nothing more than to constantly try to prescribe or define some Canadian Identity. We probably need some of that kind of thing to guard against American cultural imperialism to the extreme. It is probably true that being forced to listen to Sloan and The Tragically Hip by Canadian Content laws is a good thing for the country in some way or another. But these efforts have the reverse effect of privileging art that isn't particularly good, just because it is deemed Important and Really Canadian. The result is a national literature whose most well-known and highest selling authors speak to absolutely nothing of the average contemporary Canadian's experience, especially not anyone under 35 or so. There's a great rant against this kind of shit in Russell Smith's Noise [http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/b...]. But even that is something of a side issue here. The problem is that the literary establishment in this country is, tragically, obsessed with Being Really Canadian and so will focus its attention on books that are so desperately trying to be About Canada and Really Canadian that they are absolutely not at all fucking Canadian, and not at all good, and not at all interesting, and make a lot of people think that Canadian books and writers are automatically shit, because so much of the shit we're force-fed is indeed absolute shit. Two Solitudes is a good book, but it is also a tiresomely self-indulgent and self-conscious attempt to mark the birth of a true National Literature. And trying to be Really Canadian (usually, by the way, this means you focus on Quebec and Ontario and occasionally mention Nova Scotia, and seemingly forget any other part of the country) is pretty much the least Canadian thing you can do, and is also just annoying, especially to those of us who have lived through years of being force-fed Really Canadian Stuff. Plus it's just not relevant anymore in anything but a historical respect, especially the religious quibbling stuff, which just doesn't matter anymore in this country outside of Quebec, maybe, thank heavens. If you want to read good Canadian literature, a good rule is to avoid books that are trying to distinguish themselves as Canadian Literature by being About Canada in some absurdly self-conscious and pretentious way. Hugh MacLennan is a great author. This has got to be one of his worse efforts, though I haven't read all his stuff. Check out The Watch that Ends the Night first. It's fucking brilliant. This is not. It's the kind of thing that would work if it was really pulled off. This could, I guess, have legitimately been a great Canadian epic, but instead it comes off as competent but forced and over the top. The Watch that Ends the Night: read it. Two Solitudes: don't bother."}, {"userName": "Pooker", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4254245-pooker", "userReview": "I finished reading this book this morning, January 23, 2012. I started on January 14th. Nine days to read it? I'm shocked. I thought I breezed through it. I know I read a little bit every day and looked forward to doing so. There was never a point where I was bored or tempted to skim. That was also surprising since this is a re-read for me. It is rare that I will read a book a second time. But I made an exception for this book because it is one of this year's Canada Reads finalists and it has been about four decades since I read it the first time.On picking it up for the second time, I only vaguely remembered the story line. I suspect that even that shadowy remembrance was due to the book's title. I imagine that all Canadians know the meaning of \"two solitudes\". I do not remember ever thinking that this was one of the best books I ever read, but I suspect I would have enjoyed it, even relished it when I read it.My copy of the book is a 1972 printing. I have no doubt that I would have read it that year or at least as soon as I bought it. In 1972 a book purchased would have been a treat and would not have been relegated to a TBR heap as I have the luxury of so doing today. In 1972 I was newly married. My first child would be born that year. It was also the first year that I would vote in a federal election. I considered it my duty to make an informed choice. I would vote for Pierre Elliott Trudeau as my mother had done in 1968. I'd vote for him not because my mother had done so but because my father's absolute fury with my mother's decision in 1968 piqued my interest in politics. I had always assumed that my parents were pretty well united in everything they did. So what was it about this Trudeau fellow that caused such disagreement and fireworks between my parents? And so at that time, probably more so than any other time, I was interested in politics and thought about the people and things that divided our country and those that held it together; Bourassa and Trudeau; separatism, nationalism, federalism, multiculturalism; Canada as a mosaic, not a melting pot; the desire of the French to preserve their culture; language rights; and hockey. Paul Henderson shoots and scores. :)So this book although first published in 1945 is chock full of things that interested me decades later in '72.So, did it stand the test of time? Did it interest me four more decades later? To my surprise it did. I had not remembered MacLennan's style of writing which seemed almost Dickensian to me on second reading. So delightfully wordy and descriptive.And while I am aware of criticism of the book - that it would have been a better novel had it ended at Athanase's death, I adored the Paul and Heather story. I think their story, as the younger generation being perhaps the solution to Canadian unity, parallels nicely with the aboriginal youth led Idle no More movement in Canada today.Do I think it should win Canada Reads 2013? Nope my money's on Indian Horse. But I do think it is a book all Canadians should read and I look forward to it hanging around in the CR debates, hopefully to the end."}, {"userName": "Amy Rose", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29382445-amy-rose", "userReview": "My third read of this book."}, {"userName": "Sam", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51456636-sam", "userReview": "Long.

The opening & closing paragraphs, which described the majesty of our country's natural beauty, and how our rivers & mountains carved and disrupted and formed our landscapes also carved, disrupted, and formed our people. The divide between the French & English goes back to our founding, as every Canadian knows, but personally, it's always just been a historical fact or something I've known, but never witnessed or understood, or even discussed with an actual French Canadian. I've spent my entire life on the very western edges of Canada & thus am extremely far removed from & unfamiliar with the relationship that has existed over these hundreds of years. So for me, this book was a peek into a previously unexplored part of the Canadian national identity, which makes me deeply value this novel. Aside from the politics, this is also a great story about dreams and trying to find what you're passionate about, then living your life with happiness against the constraints of your culture, upbringing, expectations, and faith/religion. It's about making your mark in this vast country & being who you truly are, without abandoning or ignoring all that came before you.

It\u2019s a novel that has been on my \u201cto read\u201d list for a long time and it is a \u201cmust-read\u201d classic for all Canadians. The novel revolves around the city of Montreal and the province of Quebec from just before the beginning of World War I and ends just as World War II begins in 1939. There are so many layers and so many intricacies in this book and it is defined by two solitudes as the title suggests. The two solitudes are varied. There are the solitudes of the English-speaking Canadians and the French-speaking Canadians, and the book depicts so clearly why there has been so much discord between the two nationalities in Canada. It depicts the solitudes of the Canadian way and Canada and our nearest neighbours the United States of America, and how and why there are such differences between the two countries. The most glaring thing is that Canadians really never considered themselves a separate country until after the second World War. We came into our own after that war, mostly because of the bravery and valour of the soldiers who fought and died in that war. Canada took it\u2019s rightful place on the world stage after that war. There are the two solitudes of the fictional characters in the book. Young French-Canadian Paul Tallard, the son of a fading French Canadian aristocrat, is the soldering iron that connects the old French Canadian families to the English-speaking proletariat characters who controlled the money and affairs of Canada and its destiny. As Paul struggles with his English and French Canadian identities, he goes through many epiphanies that enable him to understand the solitudes and why they are there. When the book opens, the world and Canada are on the brink of war (WWI), but the world is also on the brink of enormous change and Canada is on the precipice of taking the leap forward or not - forever remaining a little country outpost in the British empire. As we all know we took the leap and became the Canada we are today. The main characters in the book are wonderfully drawn, but what really drew me in to the book is MacLennan\u2019s love for Canada and for our vast and beautiful country. It was humbling to realize just how important and wonderful my country is. It\u2019s one of those things that I\u2019ve always known, but never really took the time to really examine. It\u2019s the best place on earth and Mr. MacLennan makes that abundantly clear throughout this wonderful book. \u201cO Canada, we stand on guard for thee\u201d."}, {"userName": "Shilpa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8485664-shilpa", "userReview": "\u201cSome novels are a version of memory. Two Solitudes is just such a novel, and in it a number of characters confront the idea of shared or cultural memory and the consequences of that sharing.\u201dThis afterword encapsulates the complexity and richness of Hugh MacLennan\u2019s brilliant Canada Reads novel. The title reflects a number of themes that are portrayed throughout the book \u2013 the racial divide of a country, religion, friends and even two star-crossed lovers.\"If there had been the slightest suggestion of kindliness, the least indication of a willingness to believe the best of Quebec in such men as this from Ontario, Canada\u2019s trenchant problem would cease to exist.\u201d Throughout the novel there is a constant disparity: be it urban vs. rural; Catholic vs. Protestant; English vs. French-Canadian; father vs. son; or male vs. female. Politics drives a lot of the relationships but the complexity of the First World War backdrop is juxtaposed nicely into the real predicament the characters face in trying to justify their choices.\"Athanase felt the dilemma deeply within his own soul. Quebec wanted prestige but not change. By some profound instinct, French Canadians distrusted and disliked the American pattern of constant change. They knew it was ruthless, blind and uncontrollable.\u201dWe know this constant struggle is still ongoing. As Charles Taylor in his book Reconciling the Solitudes: Essays on Canadian Federalism and Nationalism, put it:The \u201ctwo solitudes\u201d of Hugh MacLennan are still a fundamental reality in Canada; the ways that the two groups envisage their predicament, their problems, and their common country are so different that it is hard to find a common language. They are like two photographs of the same object taken from such different points of view that they cannot be superimposed (Taylor, 1993:24).1Although the story enriches you with deeper sense of the history of Quebec, Two Solitudes by no means feels like a dry history book. The author does a beautiful job of weaving the story of an unforgettable set of characters into a social and political theme. As rich as the book is in giving the reader a perspective on the nation\u2019s European history, it is even richer because of the characters and the human interactions.1Reference: Taylor, Charles.

And almost grudgingly, out of the instinct to do what was necessary, the country took the first irrevocable steps toward becoming herself, knowing against her will that she was not unique but like all the others, alone with history, with science, with the future.\"So fitting to have finished this fabulous Canadian work on the very day Canada celebrates its birthday. Having read Barometer Rising and enjoying it, I was very much excited to receive this second Hugh MacLennan novel as a gift. Being somewhat familiar with Hugh's background, this book, from start to finish, definitely had the flavour of an autobiography with much of it loosely mirroring Hugh's own life. This book is amazing. Impressively depicting the time in Canada's history when, like the teenager it was between the end of the First World War and the start of the second, it found itself; realizing it's not just French and not just English but, like the main character, Paul Tallard, a mix, an individual unto itself. Unlike anything else I've read, this novel initially told through the eyes of the French Canadian, Athanase Tallard and the very English, Huntley McQueen, highlighted for me the extent of the Two Solitudes that existed in this country at the time and how unlike a cohesive country it was. Paul, with his French father and Irish mother symbolized the meshing of the two that needed to happen in order for Canada to acquire it's own unique identity.

There is one thing I vividly remember, one of the characters' father is dying, and its said that even though he renounced his Catholicism many years before, he will still die with \"the candles in his hands\". This had a personal resonance having a parent who was born a catholic but left her Catholicism and became an active faithful protestant. It resonated enough for me to ask if that was what we could expect at their death. The answer: no! An interesting conversation though. The book had great sweeping themes, not least religion. But also politics and ethnicity and geography. It was all there. Does it stand up today, probably not."}, {"userName": "Samu", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38455364-samu", "userReview": "A story about growing up in between two cultures, two languages, two religions and two traditions in Canada in the first part of the 20th century. Without any fanfare, the author manages to describe a world in a very believable manner. Lots of obnoxious characters, it is kinda hard to like anyone in this book safe for Captain Yardley. But I thoroughly enjoyed this. It is hard not to draw parallels to Finland and a similar situation with the Finnish and Swedish speaking communities. The world is so small, you know. We are so similar, no matter how far apart we are."}, {"userName": "Stacy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4143381-stacy", "userReview": "I read this again because I want to know about some of the books in Canada Reads this season. I didn't really like any of the characters and I found the Solitudes to be stereotyped for the 21st century.A lot of the description is of physical characteristics of individuals, which I found really boring. The descriptions of Montreal and other parts of Quebec and Canada as a whole seemed to be there, not to provide beauty, but to point out how much the author knew. The exception was when he described an episode of Paul playing hockey outdoors - that was the essence of Canada in winter."}, {"userName": "Erika", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4856143-erika", "userReview": "This book would get 2.5 stars if I could. I can understand that it is an important read for Canadians because it describes the lives of the \"maudits anglais\" and \"bloody french\" in and around Montreal between 1917 and 1939. This was a time of great change for Canada and the people living in this interface area. If Canada Reads was only for learning more about Canada, this would be my pick but as it is for the best book, this one falls into third place. My order for Canada Reads is: Indian Horse, Away, Two Solitudes, Age of Hope, February.

It provides insights into the two founding cultures which make up Canada - the Protestant English and the Catholic Quebecois - and how they struggled to maintain their own heritage while learning to accept each other's. As a newcomer to Canada in 1970 I learned first hand of the animosity between the two cultures while I lived in Ottawa during the FLQ October Crisis. Hugh MacLennan's book has given me a greater understanding of our differences and our common ground."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8760747-karen", "userReview": "I enjoyed the many dichotomies in this story: English and French, war and peace, city and country, man and woman. It didn't leave me feeling changed or mind blown in any way, but it was an enjoyable read and I loved the author's ability to describe the landscape near the St. Lawrence so beautifully. It's like you could smell the fall leaves, feel the cold wind and bask in the spring sunshine.

The notions of French-English relations, parent-child relations, and urban-rural relations are each never given a front seat in the text. Rather, like life, these drive the smaller choices made by each character from the backseat, refusing to be isolated and analyzed individually."}, {"userName": "Lauren Simmons", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7486119-lauren-simmons", "userReview": "The ultimate slow burn, I didn't really like this book until the second half and didn't love it till the last 100 pages.
