Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of Ryan's work. But this short story, based in the original The Forest of Hands and Teeth world, doesn't feel complete. This short introduces us to teenage Tabitha and her desire to leave the confines of her zombie surrounded village. Our view of Tabitha, her village and her feelings are told, rather than shown. Furthermore, we are not privy to Tabitha's relationships with her parents, her peers, the authorities in her town. All the while I was so drawn in to Ryan's intense, moody writing... I was never able to actually feel the angst she intended the reader to feel. The ending of this story was amazing. Hare Moon is all about the ending. Horror is something Ryan does so very, very well. But unfortunately the lackluster beginning still managed to taint the end of this story. Had Tabitha been a better rounded character, her friends, her love interest, the Sisters, guardians and townspeople been more than a brief passing mention this story could have been marvelous. Even Tabitha herself needed to be more fleshed out. Is she strong? Unstable? As flighty as the Sisters say she is? All we know are her base desires, what she wants and needs right now....meh. For a better Ryan short, seek out Bougainvillea in Zombies Vs. Unicorns. Her talent as a horror and a YA writer truly stand out in that one."}, {"userName": "usagi \u2606\u30df", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1101220-usagi", "userReview": "Can I just say how much I love Carrie Ryan\u2019s zombie-filled world? I LOVE IT. And she finally granted my wish of having some backstory to the Forest Village before the first book! YAY!So here with have Sister Tabitha (who makes her appearance in the first book) and her own little backstory \u2013 and surprise! One of the reasons she\u2019s so hard on Mary is because she herself was like Mary in that she wanted out of the Village and wanted to go out in the Forest to find freedom, and when she meets the boy on the other side, love. Only to be betrayed by his little Infected brother, of course.Now, at least, we know where the last entry in the Village Records came from.Anyway, at 27 pages, this was a delicious bite of what would be a wonderful prequel, if there\u2019s one scheduled or being written. I really hope there is, because I just love this world far too much to give it up for one trilogy and a novella. Ryan\u2019s really sharpened things up in this novella \u2013 you can almost smell the dead flesh that\u2019s haunting the forest, hear the wind in the leaves, and feel the rattle of the fence in your bones. The sensory input is stunning, and Ryan\u2019s at her best in this novella (and in the final novel in the trilogy \u2013 I have the feeling that both were written at or around the same time due to how well the sensory language has been sharpened from the previous two novels. It\u2019s lush, horrifying, and gorgeous all at the same time. We become Tabitha like we become Mary in the first book, longing for the wild Forest beyond the fence \u2013 so surreal that I had to shake myself back to this reality after reading it.Anyway, I\u2019m not one for novellas, usually \u2013 but this one takes the cake. I still demand more, though!(crossposted to shelfari, librarything, and witchoftheatregoing.wordpress.com)"}, {"userName": "Melissa ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1507642-melissa", "userReview": "In Ryan's first book The Forest of Hands and Teeth we meet Sister Tabitha. Now in Hare Moon we finally see the story behind the egnimatic sister. It is story of love loss and impossible choices. I love Carrie Ryan's books. In my opinion they are some of the best teen horror out there. I never pictured myself as a person who would enjoy zombie books, but Ryan's writing is brilliant. Her stories elicit the inherent fear that the image of the zombie is supposed to evoke.While I love her novels, I found myself wishing for more from this short story. I wanted to know Tabitha's family, her relationships in the village, and all the details of her life that would lead her to her ultimate choice. I think knowing that would have helped me better understand this character. Unlike her novels I felt that I was told the story rather than experiencing it the way you do in her other work.Overall this was an interesting foray into one of the side stories of this series. I did like seeing how similar Mary and Tabitha actually were. Definitely worth reading, but it left me wishing for more.Cautions for sensitive readers: violence."}, {"userName": "Sandy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8578711-sandy", "userReview": "Hare Moon is the prequel to The Forest of Hands and Teeth and it tells Sister Tabitha\u2019s story. Some of this makes The Forest of Hands and Teeth make a little more sense because it is just another piece of the puzzle. Sister Tabitha, when she was younger, it turns out was very much like Mary (or should I say, turns out Mary was very much like a young Sister Tabitha). Tabitha feels a call to the forest, to see if there\u2019s more to the outside world than what she\u2019s always been told. She feels a call to anything that remains hidden or forbidden from her. Sound familiar? It makes her being so hard on Mary make more sense because she sees herself in Mary, but Tabitha made a very different choice than Mary will make. And I believe Sister Tabitha can see that coming.Tabitha meets a boy and falls in love. And this shows us that the Sister Tabitha we thought we knew from The Forest of Hands and Teeth wasn\u2019t always cold and uncaring. She wasn\u2019t always without feeling or ambition. She didn\u2019t always know which course she was going to take. You get the impression from The Forest of Hands and Teeth that Sister Tabitha views Mary as this horrible person, that Sister Tabitha believes Mary will bring about the downfall of their village, the village she gave up everything to protect, but Mary didn\u2019t even push the limits as much as Tabitha did when she was younger. Mary never ventured outside the gates until the breech occurred first. Tabitha did. Mary didn\u2019t choose to pursue the ocean until no other option presented itself. Tabitha did. Mary didn\u2019t let infection inside the village. Tabitha did. And even though Sister Tabitha could undoubtedly see herself in Mary, it wasn\u2019t Mary who brought about the downfall of their village like Sister Tabitha feared. Tabitha is faced with the decision to flee and pursue love or to stay and sacrifice it all for the protection of her village. We all know what she choose.That\u2019s the story. Now to how I felt about the story. Tabitha\u2019s story so closely follows Mary\u2019s own story that it frustrated me. I felt like I was re-reading parts of The Forest of Hands and Teeth. I understand why they needed to be similar in some ways and almost exactly the same in others, but that doesn\u2019t mean that experiencing it again under a different name made it feel any different (or any better). The best parts weren\u2019t fully explored and the things that frustrated me about Mary I just got to relive through Tabitha. So while I felt this was an addition to The Forest of Hands and Teeth and it did make me understand Sister Tabitha more and why she behaves the way she does in The Forest of Hands and Teeth, this was only worth 3 Stars for me."}, {"userName": "Jaqueline Miguel", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21692483-jaqueline-miguel", "userReview": "H\u00e1 algum tempo atr\u00e1s (ou deveria dizer, h\u00e1 uns quantos anos atr\u00e1s) li o primeiro livro desta s\u00e9rie, denominado A Floresta de M\u00e3os e Dentes.

Nessa aldeia os zombies chamam-se Excomungados e a floresta \u00e9 chamada de Floresta de M\u00e3os e Dentes (sendo bastante \u00f3bvio o motivo da escolha do nome).

No convento, contudo, h\u00e1 muito mais segredos do que aquilo que ela esperava encontrar.\tAdorei saber o passado desta personagem e adorei tudo o que a levou a tornar-se aquilo em que se tornou.

This short novella takes us through the life of Sister Tabitha, who you'll remember is pretty uptight and very rule-focused. Now, we find out why!Tabitha knows about the hidden paths leading into the forest. She knows that it is forbidden to walk them. But she also knows that she is compelled to do it anyway! In this way, she's not so different from our usual heroine which gives us an invaluable insight into how she behaves in the first book. Tabitha just can't help herself, she opens the gates and walks along the still-fenced-off path barely separated from the Unconsecrated poking their fingers through the wires of the fence to get to her. And then she meets a boy. A boy who is definitely not from her village, who isn't Unconsecrated and who soon, will need her help.Hare Moon surprised me. I expected it to be about choices, which it was. The choices that Tabitha would have to make and the things she would have to have seen in order to become who she does in the other books. The brutality of some of her actions though was really shocking for me and I had a whole new understanding of her character - so much so that I want to re-read the entire series to try and understand that more and see little hints of young-Tabitha in Sister-Tabitha.We still get to see a bit more of the infection which I especially liked but what was really nice was to try and relate this book to the others we've already read. For example, there's one particular cameo I picked up on that made me smile.I whole-heartedly recommend this novella to you. It is, of course, quite short but it will entice to you read the entire collection all over again to piece it all together. Ryan describes Tabitha as having \"a new energy that ebbs too fast so that she immediately craves it again\". That's how I feel about these books - so good that you just HAVE to read them again."}, {"userName": "Justine", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4818199-justine", "userReview": "This is a short story by Carrie Ryan the author of The Forest of Hands and Teeth.*SPOILER ALERT*It's a love story. It's about Tabitha as a teenager and how she \u00a0becomes a nun when the town leaders decide that she is a dreamer so no man would want to marry her. She leaves the town out through one of the gates into the fenced paths. The unconsecrated always surround her. She ventures all the way to one of the gates. Here she meets Patrick, a boy from another village. They sit, chat and fall in love. Patrick stops coming, Tabitha doesn't know why. Then he leaves a note saying he loves her but his father is sick.\u00a0Tabitha goes back to the gate all the time to see if Patrick has returned, he hasn't. Then during the hare moon he shows up with his little brother stating their village is infected but that they are not. Tabitha welcomes them in and hides them. Then in the middle of the night Patricks brother turns and bites two other nuns. So Tabitha has to kill him. Then she turns Patrick out to the unconsecrated.Well the love story started off good units Tabitha basically killed her lover. But I guess if she kept him and they lived happily ever after she just would not be the same in The Forest of Hands and Teeth. She might actually be nice.

I don't want to, though, because she grows into a bitter bitch by the time the events on Forest of Hands and Teeth take place and although I was still intrigued by her character when I read the story then, I much rather her younger self portrayed in Hare Moon) does feel like something that could've been extended into a book, maybe not a 400 pages long book, but a book nonetheless - but that doesn't mean it wasn't amazing.The journey of Tabitha from a selfish, dream-big kind of girl to a woman who puts her village and her God before her own needs and desires is a painful one but also one that will keep you reading it until the last shudder-inducing line. As with Carrie Ryan's other books, this 30-page short story speaks of love, discovery and sacrifice - with a slightly psychotic-er spin on the formula, however.Hare Moons feels, reads and breathes originality and although some of the content in it could definitely have been expounded on, it stands as the best short story I've ever had the pleasure to read since Rachel Vincent's Binge."}, {"userName": "Lara", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/309689-lara", "userReview": "Eh. I'm in the minority (yet again, it seems), but I was not a fan of this. Part of the problem here, I will admit, is that I just don't really like short stories in general. I think some folks actually do know how to write them well, but sadly most people do not. This one felt much more like a basic outline for a full-length novel than it did a fully-realized short story. There's NO character development, very little in the way of plot, and several situations that just didn't really seem believable to me. I appreciated the back story of Sister Tabitha, but just found it very poorly done, and not anywhere near as compelling as the rest of this series. It's a shame, because if expanded on, I think this could make a really heart-wrenching story. I'm not sure why so many YA writers are doing these little side stories and between-books stories these days, but I kind of wish they'd stick to what they're good at. Sorry, Carrie Ryan.

I felt detached throughout the entire book. It's written in third person, present tense, and I haven't read a book written in that perspective, as far as I'm aware. And maybe it's just because I wasn't used to it, but I thought the writing was stilted. It just didn't flow as well as it did for the novels in the series. And the romance was just dry. I didn't feel any chemistry between Tabitha and Patrick (I had to think for a bit to remember what their names were, which just shoes how much of an impression they left on me).Quite frankly, Hare Moon just didn't really need to exist.

Her obsession takes her to the gate every day where she makes contact with Patrick from another village, proving that there are other survivors. Now her dreams are of a future with Patrick, and her dedication to the Sisterhood comes under question.This was an interesting prequel to The Forest of Hands and Teeth, showing how Tabitha found it hard to accept her world, just as Mary does in the novel. Tabitha explores the compound, finding a book that tells of the history of the village and why things are kept from the survivors, which makes her decision much more difficult. Now she understands why they need to be protected from the truth, but her feelings for Patrick leave her conflicted about her own future. The book builds towards a climax as a terrified Patrick arrives with his brother after an outbreak at his village. They seek sanctuary and Tabitha's decisions are to have consequences for herself and the compound. It was an interesting story because it explains a bit of the history behind the zombies and the compound, shedding new light on the motivations of the Sisterhood.

I mean, we females who find zombie culture interesting need to stick together! But I would be lying if I said Hare Moon impressed or entertained me. The writing is formulaic and a rehashing of the major themes in The Forest of Hands and Teeth. I could forgive this if it brought new depth or perspective to those themes, but it does not. Once again we have a selfish heroine who is driven by lust and a desire for more. Sister Theresa was the most interesting character in The Forest of Hands and Teeth. Her backstory negates much of her potential as a complex character. I suspect Ryan's intention is for the reader to ultimately sympathize with Theresa for the difficult choices she is forced to make, but I could not. Theresa's capacity to love and sacrifice seemed false. I was told by the narrator that she loved and ultimately sacrificed her personal happiness for the survival of her village, but Theresa's reactions (such as her heartless dismay in seeing the younger brother and her feeling of betrayal when Patrick comes to her for help rather than romance) are at odds with this.

It is a short story and not a full-length novel, so be warned it is a quick read.Again, Carrie Ryan is very adept at drawing us into the world where a village stands in the middle of a forest surrounded by a fence and the Unconsecrated (zombies). The world building in this series has always been top notch and once again I was enthralled by the world that Tabitha inhabits. Tabitha starts off the story as a character you feel compassion for as she struggles to be free of the constraints of the village. She yearns for freedom in the world beyond and for a short period of time finds happiness.Of course, since Tabitha is doomed to become one of the Sisters protecting the village and the \"villain\" of THE FOREST OF HANDS AND TEETH, we know she is doomed to not find the freedom and happiness she yearns for.Carrie Ryan does a remarkable job with the story and the ending is truly heartbreaking for not only Tabitha, but the reader."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4979538-erin", "userReview": "Hmmm...I have to say this was a little odd, but for a REALLY quick read it wasn't too bad. Obviously everything was pretty rushed given the short 40 pgs., but Carrie Ryan did manage to draw me into the story more than I would have expected. I never read Forest of Hands and Teeth, so this was an entirely new world for me. I was drawn in by Tabitha's desire to see what lies beyond her sheltered life, and her fearlessness as she dares to go beyond the fences. She and Patrick had such a whirlwind romance in the fleeting times they had together, and it was hard to feel attached to the characters in such a short period. Hare Moon had a little danger, a little creepiness, a decent quick romance, and an odd, left-me-hanging ending.

She gives us insight into the development of the steely character of Sister Tabitha, and her resolve to protect the safety of the village over the desires of individuals - including her own.Hare Moon's world building is sparse and lacks the detail to really immerse the reader in the environment of the story. It requires reading at least the first novel in the series to place the cultural mores of the village in context. While it's possible to glean a bare bones understanding of the world from the story alone, I don't think the emotional development of the protagonist has the same heft as it would had the reader greater understanding of the world.As another reviewer noted, the character of Sister Tabitha bears remarkable resemblance to the protagonists of the other novels, in particular Mary from the first novel. This might be considered a weakness - and indeed, there are commonalities between different characters playing similar roles across the series - but my take is that making Tabitha and Mary alike in their general outlook makes their choices more powerful. As they mirror each other in the beginning, the stories show the path not taken in each of their lives, and make the character of Tabitha much more sympathetic and tragic within the novel. Mary makes the choice to follow her own desires, and the decisions she makes have consequences that impact the fate of her friends and loved ones in negative ways. Tabitha, with greater knowledge of the sacrifices made by her forebears, chooses to set aside her own feelings for the good of the community. Tabitha's choices are heartbreaking, and define her hard nature later on, and comparing the two characters and their sets of choices ask the reader to examine the question of whether it is best to follow one's dreams regardless of others, or whether the good of the community outweighs the individual's desires.The prose in Ryan's story is as dreamy and sensual as it is in her novels (again, most particularly in the first novel, which I feel was the strongest). I find this to be effective in allowing the young adult audience to experience the intensity of the emotions of deeply profound and real experiences (death and loss, alienation, betrayal, love, sexuality) without adding graphic detail that might be inappropriate to the audience. It forces the reader to look at what events mean to the character, and how the character feels (or forces herself not to feel) rather than focus as much on what happened and how.Ultimately, I found the story to be an excellent companion to the series, though weak as a standalone piece. It fits nicely into the series as a chronological prequel to be read following the first book. Reading it this way, I feel, gives the short story heft as a background to a minor character in the novel and a counterpoint to the choices made by the protagonist in the novel, while allowing the reader to flesh out the world of the short story with details from the novel."}, {"userName": "Kayleigh {K-Books}", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3996633-kayleigh-k-books", "userReview": "Hare Moon Review on K-BooksI really didn't know what to expect when reading Hare Moon. I absolutely loved The Forest of Hands and Teeth series. It was the first zombie book I ever read and I loved it, and both of the sequels that follow it. However as much as I loved FoH&T Tabitha was without a doubt my least favourite character. I really disliked her so much and to find that this short story set years before FoH&T revolved around Tabitha, well it made me really reluctant to start reading it.Saying that though I actually quite enjoyed it.Tabitha has lived in the village in the middle of the infested forest but she longs to see what is behind the metal fences. Can it really just be the one village and a world full of Unconsecrated? Determined to find out she sneaks away from the village down the fenced in path to see what is there, here she meets Patrick. But can she really betray the secrets and future of her village for one boy?I really enjoyed reading Hare Moon and we get to see a side to Tabitha that I could not have ever imagined while reading FoH&T. During the first book in this series Tabitha comes across as cold and doesn't care what happens to anyone or how they feel as long as the village survives. In Hare Moon, we see her younger and a lot more carefree and I loved seeing the romance between her and Patrick developing. I think Hare Moon really puts a lot of things that happen and how Tabitha acts during FoH&T into perspective and you can really see why she does those things.I did enjoy this short story and I loved delving back into the incredible zombie-filled world that Carrie Ryan has created. It really reminded me how much I really love this series and after reading this if I were to read FoH&T again, which I'm sure I will at some point as I love it, I know I will be reading it with new eyes and a different perspective.This short story is a great read for any fans of this series."}, {"userName": "Michele at A Belle's Tales", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5464054-michele-at-a-belle-s-tales", "userReview": "\"She wonders how the world ever fell apart with this much love in it.\"After reading The Forest of Hands and Teeth a couple of weeks ago, I became obsessed with this series. It is incredibly intense, and I just love it! In book one, Sister Tabitha terrified me so I love that this short story is a prequel that tells Tabitha's story as a young girl. Hare Moon sheds so much light on who Tabitha truly was.Not only is Hare Moon heartbreaking, but it is so eye-opening as to how and why Tabitha grows into the woman that she does and gives a new and different perspective of her actions regarding Mary. It also serves as a reminder that tragedy and grief can change a person into someone unrecognizable. \"Choice is what makes us human. It is what separates us from the Unconsecrated. But that does not mean that choice cannot turn men into monsters.\"This story is a prequel and can be read even if you haven't read The Forest of Hands and Teeth, but I feel it makes a bigger impact if read after.\"...Sister Tabitha understands that she has to decide what she will stand for: her own desire for love or devotion to her village and the people within it.\"This review also appears on my blog, A Belle's Tales."}], "description": "Tabitha can\u2019t shake the feeling that something exists beyond the fences of her village.
