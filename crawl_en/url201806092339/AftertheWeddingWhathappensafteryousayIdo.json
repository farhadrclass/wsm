I was able to follow along quite easily though since there are callbacks to book #1 throughout this book. I wish that I had liked it more, but it just was way too long and dragged in a lot of parts.\"After the Wedding\" is told in the third person and we get to follow several characters who live in or are someone related to inhabitants of the island of Roone. Nell is preparing to finally marry James (they were in book #1). Nell initially dated James's brother Tim, but now the two of them are together. And Tim ended up marrying Nell's long time pen pal (this whole book is so incestuous). Nell's mother has been gone about two years and she is still missing her every day and devastated that she is gone. Nell and James are happy though until James's brother Tim comes back to Roone seemingly hell bent on ruining things for the two of them.We also follow Laura who has turned Walter's home into a B&B. Living with her partner Gavin, her two twin sons, and expecting another set, Laura is content with how things are with Gavin. She doesn't want to marry again since she feels like she already married the love of her life who died and she doesn't feel that way about Gavin.Nell's father is realizing that though he walked away from his marriage, his affair with the other woman is not all it's cracked up to be. Imelda and Hugh are now going to be foster parents. They get a teen girl called Eve who does her best to keep them at arm's length for pretty good reasons.We also have a plot that kind of ties things together with a young girl who goes missing. It turns the island upside down with many people scared that something dark and ugly could happen there.I found myself most interested in Eve's story. No spoilers, but it was heartbreaking. I didn't find myself engaged at all with Laura. I actually found her offputting with how she kept thinking and talking about Gavin. I wouldn't have blamed him for running off. I honestly felt baffled about why Nell didn't tell James's she was uncomfortable about his brother being around. The writing was okay. I am used to Meaney's writing at this point. I have read three other of her books. I just thought honestly that going from character to character hurt this book. Since this book is set up to be a sequel of the first book and is supposedly about Jame's brother not wanting to let go of Nell, that whole story-line barely figures in the first half of the book. When it comes up, it is dealt with in a few chapters and not very well I have to say. The ending left things up in the air for many of the characters which is why I got book #3 in this series."}, {"userName": "Amanda - Go Book Yourself", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4684302-amanda---go-book-yourself", "userReview": "Originally posted on my blog here: http://www.gobookyourself.info/2014/0...After the wedding was provided by Hachette Ireland in return for an honest review.Please note that this is the follow up to One Summer and may contain spoilers if you haven't read the first book yet. Don't say I didn't warn you!!I put off writing this review for quite some time. When the review is written, that's it, it's over....no more Roone...and that's depressing :( Let's face it. There was no way I wasn't going to love this book. I feel in love with Roone in One summer. I personally think A few fans should get together, buy an Island off the coast and name it Roone. It's just so perfect..Okay enough swooning.So here we are, back on Roone. Some familiar faces, some new. Some have come back...and some have not :(. I was saddened to hear that some of the characters would not be heard from in this novel. I can't say any more without spoiling but lets just say it tugged at the heart strings.Tim is long gone..in Dublin with Katie and everyone on Roone is trying to get on with life. Nell is preparing for her wedding, Laura has turned Walters house into a b&b and Imelda and Hugh are welcoming a new foster girl.Life seems idylic until a young child goes missing while her family is visiting the Island. The community is ripped in too. This sort of thing just doesn't happen on Roone. Coming from a small town, I really could really relate to this. When the crime rate is low something like this can really make you question everything you knew about the place you grew up in. Weeks and weeks go by with no sign of the girl. Was it an accident or something more sinister? Could there be a murderer at large on Roone?I would have loved to have more suspense and more of the novel focusing on the missing child but I understand that it must be hard to fit everything in and still have the novel be of a feasible length. Just like One summer, After the wedding is a character driven story. You will care about the inhabitants of this fictional Island. You will worry about them, cry for them and laugh with them. It's an incredibly authentic read.Roisin's writing reminds me of Heaney's poetry. She can take the ordinary and make it seem extraordinary. She appreciates the beauty of simplicity, making me yearn for simple pleasures like a soft blanket on green grass under a sunny sky or a drink in a country pub with old friends.A highly recommended read"}, {"userName": "Malia", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5953660-malia", "userReview": "This is story the follow-up to Meaney's 'One Summer', and just like its predecessor, is a charming, engaging read. The story of Nell, James, Laura and Co. continues some months after One Summer ends. Several changes have taken place, not all of them happy, but Meaney has a lovely style of blending cheerful, happy stories, with very real ones. This would probably be classified as chick-lit, but do not be discouraged by that. It, and Meaney's other books, have much more depth than the stereotypical chick-lit novel. The happy endings in her books are usually not predictable, and not everyone necessarily gets one. There is, as in this book, always a small element of mystery (in this case a little girl has gone missing on the island of Roone where the story takes place). I won't go too much into the plot, but if you like Meaney's other books, or writers like Marian Keyes, Lisa Jewell, Jojo Moyes, I have a feeling you will enjoy this book, too.Find more reviews and bookish fun at http://www.princessandpen.com"}, {"userName": "Nicki Southwell", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15668275-nicki-southwell", "userReview": "Excellent.

However, there is just enough recapping here so that you can dig on in and get to know them all, along with their backstories, without it being overt or of detriment to those readers who have done the sensible thing and read them in order. This is the real charm of Roisin Meaney's writing - believable characters that seem to effortlessly unspool on to the page and capture you in their web.There is so much going on in this book - a wedding, a missing child, retirement, fostering of a very damaged teenager - that it could have been very disjointed and confusing. Somehow it all weaves together as a whole and you get the idea of a very real community on Roone. The myriad story threads are weaved skilfully together and each character has their own definite voice with some being substantially more likeable than others. Indeed, so realistic is the setting and the storytelling that you can feel the briny air on your face and yearn for a swift pint at Fitzgeralds.I'm not quite sure how Roisin Meaney does it but long may she do so. This is yet another book about normal people in (mostly) normal situations but somehow she elevates the mundane to the wonderous."}, {"userName": "Corinne Johnston", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61830139-corinne-johnston", "userReview": "I quite enjoyed this but kept thinking the characters a bit convoluted, then I discovered they are all in an earlier book (which I'll now have to read) wish I'd checked first!

I had no idea this was the case until I finished the book and it certainly didn\u2019t affect my enjoyment of the read (but now I\u2019d like to go back and read the first novel and see what I missed!).I found the writing a bit difficult at first- I don\u2019t think there was anything wrong with it in the slightest but it took me some time to get used to the way the people were presented and to get into the plot. There are a large number of characters to follow and as most are related to each other in some way (but not all!) I took some time getting used to them all before really following the threads entirely.One thing I liked very much about After the Wedding was the island of Roone itself. When I was a child I used to visit my great-aunt who lived on the island of Millport and this reminded me very much of those holidays. I was immediately attracted to the closeness of the inhabitants, the simpler way of living and the sense of community. However with that small community feel when someone does something that is disapproved of you could spend a lifetime having others accept your choices. That would be very difficult to overcome which was the case for Nell\u2019s father. I felt the empathy though for him from his daughter which warmed my heart and connected her to him in a wonderful way- that bond for her was important having lost her mother recently. There are so many great story lines that it\u2019s hard to pinpoint a favourite. I loved Imelda and Hugh, their love and frustration for the child they are fostering were felt across the page and Laura\u2019s B&B was fabulously chaotic- the imminent arrival of her second set of twins while running this hotel single-handedly was great for comic relief as the underlying plot of the missing child was felt by every resident of Roone. I really enjoyed this book and would definitely welcome another Roisin Meaney novel to my book shelf.Thank you to Hachette Books Ireland for our review copy.

We join the islanders before the wedding of two of the characters, and on returning to the Island after their wedding they return to find the Island has been rocked by a tragedy.There is something in the writing of Irish authors that lures you into a story and keeps you hooked throughout; a charm in their style. That is no different here. Roisin captures you from the very beginning and firmly imbeds you in the island community.The story starts with the disappearance of a young girl from a family of holidaymakers and follows the characters through the series of both fortunate and unfortunate events that unfold after it. It portrays the reality of life in a stark contrast to the idyllic island setting.The story of the missing girl is a constant theme throughout the story, sometimes directly in the search for her and sometimes indirectly in the islanders now looking at life and trying to find more positives. The narrative comes from each of the characters in the main cast and this really helps to create the community atmosphere and the sense of everyone coming together in bad and good times to become stronger.Based on reading this novel I will definitely be looking out for more from this author. I think you will enjoy this if you have previously enjoyed Zoe Miller and Penny Vincenzi novels."}, {"userName": "Penny McGill", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7033258-penny-mcgill", "userReview": "I thought I'd like this book more than I did.
