This book literally took my breath away. It was a difficult book to read. I cried and felt conflict and anger. I cheered, hoped and prayed that this young family would find a positive outcome in the end. Though life certainly is never the same, life does go on for those of us left behind - the ones who are left with a hole in our hearts. Though not a typical romance novel, this book does have a heartwrenching love story that will touch your heart."}, {"userName": "Lydia", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9711553-lydia", "userReview": "This book had me from page one. The author's literary way of making the simplest sentence stand up and shout was enjoyable and left me wanting more, despite the tragic plot. The book is about a young, married couple with two beloved daughters, struggling to reconnect and let each other in. Seth, the carefree, emotionally absent husband and father is torn apart with guilt and scorned with blame when their youngest daughter drowns under his watch. The book chronicles the year following their daughter's death and the heartbreaking facts and decisions they are left with. Seth and Alyssa's grief is absolutely palpable in this story. I felt for each one of them throughout every page. Despite Seth's poor judgement, I sympathized with him immediately. And despite Alyssa's crass and irrational decisions, I feel her pain and love for her lost daughter and just could not place judgement on her due to her all-consuming grief. Scenes where she was left to wallow in her sorrow alone really got to me; I teared up for her on several occasions."}, {"userName": "Babette", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10965710-babette", "userReview": "I couldn't put this book down!"}, {"userName": "Ginger", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3104791-ginger", "userReview": "What an emotional read! I had to keep reminding myself this was fiction. I can't imagine losing a child, no matter the age. I actually learned a lot about the grieving process, the court system (due to one of the parents being a substance abuser) and mandatory counseling. Highly recommend this book. Even if you've never lost a child, this book will help you better understand those who have. One would have to be cold-hearted not to root for this family and want to see them pull through such a devastating time in their lives."}, {"userName": "Frederick Brooke", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5493132-frederick-brooke", "userReview": "This is the story of a couple who lose a young child in a tragic accident. It\u2019s a heavy topic, and as the father of three children I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to read it. But once I started, I couldn\u2019t put it down. The author is herself a therapist and specializes in grief counseling. The tragedy has a catastrophic effect on the couple\u2019s relationship, as is typically the case in real life. All sorts of blame games are being played, only they don\u2019t feel like games. The older sister of the accident victim, Daisy, age 5, hasn\u2019t spoken one word since the tragedy. The lives of the main characters are spiraling out of control, as each one of them in his or her own way retreats into an inner space that might still provide emotional safety.The book is set in Santa Cruz, California, a surfer paradise south of San Francisco. In this liberal town there is a good social infrastructure in place to help people like this young family. The court mandates counseling and therapy for both the mom, Alyssa, and the dad, Seth. The depiction of the therapist, Katherine, who brings her own deep dark secret into the mix, struck me as hauntingly realistic and at the same time poetic.As in this little comment at the end of a therapy session with Seth (Seth is blamed for the tragedy because he is a drug user and was getting high instead of watching the two little girls when they were playing by the pond): \u201c\u2019Try to see this as a wake up call.\u2019 I know he wants more; reassurance that everything is going to be fine. Even if the charges are dropped, things will be far from fine, given Alyssa\u2019s refusal to speak to him not to mention the grief that\u2019s going to be kicking his ass for who knows how long.\u201dAs I was reading this book my eyes watered over many times, even in public places. I thought about why it moved me so deeply. It\u2019s a beautifully crafted story of tragedy and redemption. Why do people so often need a tragedy before they will open their eyes? What will give them the strength and courage to recover and survive? Out of Breath tackles themes that will be familiar to every parent and every person who was ever afraid to confront their deepest fears. Prepare a supply of tissues, and read this book."}, {"userName": "Justine", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9209214-justine", "userReview": "Sometimes when I read a book with less-than-stellar writing, I can get past it-- usually because I love the characters, the plot is intriguing, creative premise, etc etc. With this book, however, my problems with the style didn't allow me to really get lost in the story. The author is a counselor, and it shows in her writing in both a good (she really knows grief & grief counseling) way and bad (she writes like a counselor) way. When I say she writes like a counselor, I mean that at times the style was WAY too clinical and \"I am talking about this feeling\" for me. She spelled out exactly how each character was feeling at each moment, bluntly stated what was happening in each scene, and left no mystery as to what the characters' motives and thoughts were behind every. single. action. Not to mention one of the characters was a COMPLETELY unlikable douchebag, which I'm not a fan of-- this guy has been Alyssa's best friend since childhood and she never noticed that he's single-mindedly obsessed with \"possessing\" her to the point that he disregards his own children?! I don't know about that. I did have an emotional reaction, but i felt it could have been stronger, given the subject matter (death of a toddler). This was probably because I wasn't allowed to feel the emotions with the characters because they didn't really  feel  them either, they just stated how they felt. It was interesting to read about a grieving family from the point of view of a counselor, but there wasn't enough novel writing in it for me. I'm still interested to see what comes next from this author though, her subject matter and emotional pull was enough for me to read her second work whenever that may come!"}, {"userName": "Jenn", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51780014-jenn", "userReview": "I loved this book! Seth, Alyssa and their 2 young girls seem like a perfect family except for one thing - Seth's marijuana habit. Suddenly their world is shattered when their youngest daughter, Nevaeh, drowns when Seth was supposed to be watching her. After Seth returns a positive reading for dope Alyssa vents her fury and grief at him, blaming him for their daughter's death. The only people she can trust are her grandmother, who raised her, and her oldest friend in the world, Greg. Seth is distraught with guilt. Meanwhile, Child Services become involved and Seth is forced to leave the family home and get treatment for his addiction. Both he and Alyssa are ordered to receive counselling. Against her better judgement, therapist Katherine agrees to take the case, opening old unhealed wounds from the past death of her own daughter. Throughout the next 12 months Katherine helps Seth and Alyssa understand their grief, and also to deal with the demons in their pasts. In doing so she also needs to deal with her own demons. Seth just wants his family back, but Alyssa doesn't know if she can ever forgive him for Nevaeh's death. Written in the present tense the book is narrated by Alyssa, Seth, Katherine, Alyssa's friend Greg, and social worker Leah. It is beautifully written, giving a real and poignant insight to the complexity of grief, and to the raw physical and mental anguish faced by parents when a child dies."}, {"userName": "Marie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9775024-marie", "userReview": "Susan Salluce, author of \"Out of Breath\" has written a deeply moving story of a couple who loses their 1 1/2 year old daughter to drowning. Nevaeh's death a marriage with Seth drinking and drugging which is alienating Alyssia and pushing her closer to a childhood friend, Gregory, the police officer who arrests Seth for this drowning.The story takes us through dealing with the death of a child, emotions of anger, monumental sadness, blame, deceit, misplaced love and finding a way back to a safe place. With the help of Katherine, who, quite innocently turns out to be the psychologist to Alyssa, Seth and Gregory, the story takes some twists and turns. What makes this book believable is the way the psychologist is so believable - the writer, Susan Salluce has much experience in this field and it comes through in her writing. If you have ever been in therapy, you will know what I mean. A very sad story, heartwrenching and believable. I gave it five stars because of the writer's ability to convey this to the reader and keep the reader interested in what comes next.

I don't think that this really impacted the story since the author included Katherine, a counsellor. I've always heard that you should write what you know and I believe the author did a wonderful job depicting various stages of grief, addiction, recovery, guilt, falling down, and what it takes to get back up again. The characters are believable and honest. I would have given this 5 stars but for the typos and editing errors which I believe should have been caught by the editors and publishers.
