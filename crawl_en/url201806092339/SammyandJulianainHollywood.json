Sin importar ad\u00f3nde fueras. Te encuentran. Y luego te lastiman\".Este es el libro de Benjamin Alire Saenz que se desarrolla m\u00e1s atr\u00e1s en el tiempo. 1968, Las Cruces. Sammy y Juliana viven en Hollywood, pero no en el Hollywood lleno de estrellas, carros lujosos y paseos de la fama, no. Viven en un barrio chicano de Las Cruces y est\u00e1n aprendiendo que la vida cambia de la noche a la ma\u00f1ana, que las revoluciones est\u00e1n estallando y que la bandera del amor trasciende incluso la muerte. Esta historia, que es quiz\u00e1 la que menos me ha gustado de todas las que he le\u00eddo de Benjamin, se centra en c\u00f3mo un grupo de chicos lidia con la p\u00e9rdida de sus amigos, con las guerras que Estados Unidos est\u00e1 peleando en otros continentes y con la consigna de que el amor lo vence todo. Son chicos de secundaria que est\u00e1n obligados a crecer muy r\u00e1pido por sus circunstancias, por el lugar en donde viven y porque, si quieren sobrevivir, deben salir de ese Hollywood en el que est\u00e1n atrapados. Es muy curioso leer una novela juvenil que se desarrolle en 1968, pues las din\u00e1micas son s\u00faper diferentes. No tenemos la f\u00f3rmula del instalove ni de las relaciones r\u00e1pidas, sino un aire nuevo de liberaci\u00f3n, de peleas por derechos que apenas se estaban instaurando, de permisividad, de patriotismo, del pensar que enlistarse en el ej\u00e9rcito arreglar\u00eda tu vida y la de tu familia... Son muchos los \u00e1ngulos nuevos que surgen en una historia de la d\u00e9cada de los 60s. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no me gust\u00f3 tanto el libro? A pesar de saber que las historias de Benjamin se centran much\u00edsimo en sus personajes y no tanto en grandes giros de trama, sent\u00ed que a esta le faltaron ambas cosas. Sent\u00ed que el ritmo era much\u00edsimo m\u00e1s lento que en sus otros libros y, si bien en los dem\u00e1s eso lo compensan personajes memorables, en este no lo percib\u00ed as\u00ed. Sammy, Juliana, el Pifas y sus compa\u00f1eros de colegio son un grupo bastante peculiar, pero ninguno resalt\u00f3 lo suficiente como para que les cogiera cari\u00f1o y adorara la historia."}, {"userName": "Hilary", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2808450-hilary", "userReview": "I'm not sure I've ever given a book 5 stars before, but this one is remarkable.

He has won many awards for his writing, and after reading Sammie and Juliana in Hollywood, I believe they are deserving.I adore this novel, especially for its powerfully drawn characters and fluent, often funny prose. The title characters are wonderful--bold and bigger than life, yet believable. And the plot is compelling and unpredictable, skirting many of the minefields of cliches. Picture an urban high school in the year 1969-poor kids being drafted into the Viet Nam war, racism still blatant and ugly, and girls, especially poor ones, suffering a double standard. Their barrio is the only world Sammie and Juliana know, but it presents them with a terrible choice: escape it now or come to terms with its many deprivations. That is only one of the fundamentally brutal conflicts that fill the novel. The dialogue is true and often heart-rending, when it's not laugh-out-loud funny. Like real teenagers, the ones in this story are not shy about saying whatever they want, no matter how harsh or politically incorrect. As a result, the dialogue cracks with energy and authenticity.

I`m Mexican so I had no problem reading this book at all. I loved Sammy and all the characters in the story. His story was so real and you felt like you actually knew him. The writing was excellent and the plot was great. But I didn`t like how all these bad things kept happening to Sammy. And there really wasn`t a happy ending. Although he is very smart, he goes to a community college and takes care of his sister after his Dad dies. And he is the only one of his friends to stay in Hollywood, when he was the one who really wanted to get out. Overall, it was one of the best stories I have read in a long time."}, {"userName": "Ari", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2519179-ari", "userReview": "There is no glossary in this book, no italics to show that it is a Spanish word. The reader must figure that out from themselves and use the context in order to translate it. I encourage readers to not just skip over the Spanish words, but to learn them (especially if you are pretty good at Spanish, you need to know the slang too, not just the formal talk. My friends who speak Spanish laugh at Spanish students \"proper\" Spanish). As for the look at how gay people were treated, I don't think many current students know how bad homosexuals had it in the '60s and '70s, even though that was supposed to be a \"liberating and accepting\" time. Sammy says it best concerning what love is deemed acceptable \"It's funny, everyone had always told us love was another word for belonging. No one, no one had ever told me that love was another name for exile.\" (pg. 212) I wish it was funny because it was untrue, but it's not funny, and it's true.The nice thing about re-reading is you find new things to appreciate. I was enthralled by how Sammy described people. I wanted to meet him just to hear how he would describe me. When talking about Juliana he says, \"Sometimes, she could look at you and you could see what she was trying to tell you don't screw with me because I've been through things, and you don't know a damn thing about what it's cost me to be here, right here, right here on this worthless piece of ground, so don't treat me like I'm some crack on a sidewalk because if you step on me, you'll never take another step without thinking of me. I swear to God you won't.\" (pg. 13) He's very observant and has a sort of \"old soul\". He's well liked, but quiet, not a big fan of parties. However he does attend some parties and he's not really socially awkward. It was nice to read a book about a guy who's not a nerd (I know that sounds mean, but do you get what I'm saying?). I also love Juliana for that above quote but she frustrated me a bit. The title is sort of misleading because Sammy & Juliana's relationship is not the main focus of the story. However it does serve as the backdrop to everything that Sammy does.Sammy and Juliana In Hollywood is an aching story that is apologetically depressing. I didn't remember it being so maddeningly sad. I'll tell you right now, this book is really about the little things making people happy. It's about leaving home, moving on from everything and anything and appreciating those little joys that are few and far between. This novel covers so much both historically and personally. The Chicano movement is on the rise, people are protesting the Vietnam war, violence against homosexuals, racism against all Brown people, class issues, ageism, students not being free to speak their mind. It's a lot to handle but Sammy has a lot to handle in his own life and this book mirrors his internal turmoil as well as the external. Sammy grows in leaps and bounds and it's the very definition of a rewarding experience to read about. There is so much more I want to say about this novel, but this review is already pretty lengthy.

Saenz has written a thought-provoking book that tells about the United States during the late 1960's through the eyes of a Mexican-American student. Sammy lives in Hollywood - not Hollywood, CA but Hollywood, NM, a barrio outside of Los Crues. Sammy's life is hard; he is a realist, but hopeful. This was not an easy read, but the story is very powerful.I was 15 in 1969; Sammy and I did not have the same high school experiences. It is good to be reminded that my life is not typical or even usual.This was one of the reasons that I really liked this novel. I was getting to see my life from a very different viewpoint. I also liked it because I felt I was living along with Sammy. His experiences seemed real; I laughed and cried along with him. I was sad when the book ended. I am not sure how many young adults would pick this book up in my part of the world. The Mexican-American experience in the US is fairly foreign to these kids. However, I think if they would listen to this story they would be as fascinated as I was. Robert Ramirez' narration really added to my reading experience. There are Spanish words and phrases in this book. If I had been reading the book, I would have skipped right over them. With Ramirez reading to me, I could hear the words and get the context more completely. I recommend this book to young adults who are curious about living through the 60's, to adults who did live through those times and to anyone who liked stories that are realistic and well written."}, {"userName": "Hannahlily", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1878678-hannahlily", "userReview": "It's a YA novel about regret. Guilt, grief, shattered dreams and sadness too, but mostly regret, dealt with in the most poignant and heartrending fashion. A LOT happens, probably too much for one novel, but with characters as vivid and real as these, it's hard to file any serious complaints. Probably the only novel I've ever read that has a twist BEGINNING instead of a twist ENDING, with one of the biggest shocks I've ever read in a book coming in the first 50 pages. The voice is fantastic, with a stylistic repetition I've never seen used before. It's sad, it's very VERY sad, with the tiniest faint glimmers of hope. Emotionally brutal and tragic, yes, but maybe the best novel I've ever read about coming to terms with change, growing up, and the transient nature of life.

But it's also hopeful-- not throughout the whole book by any means, but definitely at certain points. The ending was incredibly ambiguous and time seemed to kind of melt away, but I was okay with that. I think the most interesting thing about this book is that Saenz is clearly trying to teach a lesson to his readers, but never gives an indication of what the lesson is; the purpose is for each individual to find something that holds fast to them. And while I couldn't relate deeply to the novel because I live in a different world than Hollywood, I found what had meaning to me (though I can't really put it in words, so I'm going to keep that to myself). Saenz's novels never fail to stir me up and think.

This may be one of the best YA books I've ever read, my top 5 for sure. It hit me on such an emotional level like no other book has ever done before. It may have been the fact that almost all the characters in the book were Mexican-American and that somehow made it more personal since I myself am Mexican-American. And that kids is why representation matters. I think anyone can fully appreciate this book though, that just made it more personal for me.Set in the late 1960s, the story takes place in the small town of Las Cruces, New Mexico in a Chicano neighborhood called Hollywood. This coming of age story follows a young man named Sammy Santos, just before he's about to enter his last year of high school.I'll just come out and say it: This book is unapologetically depressing. It deals with topics such as race, class, sexuality, and the war that was currently going on in Vietnam. Don't let that scare you though. As sad as this book was, it was also extremely eye-opening to life in 1960s America. In a weird way it was also extremely relevant, even for today, and I think that's where a lot of the sadness comes from. The fact that stuff being said about race and class and war almost 50 years ago is still relevant today.The writing in this book is absolutely beautiful. It took me a few chapters to get used to the writing style but once I was in, I was in. I loved that the author wasn't afraid to incorporate so much Spanish into the book. Most of the time when you see Spanish-speaking characters in books you only ever see the occasional Spanish word or phrase thrown into the mix here and there. Not this one though. In this one you get full pages of Spanish, mostly in conversations. Of course they alternate between Spanish and English during those conversations to give the non-Spanish speaking reader context, so even if you don't speak Spanish you can still understand everything that's being said. It's all very subtle though. As a Spanish speaker, I can tell you that is definitely how a lot of people talk, alternating between Spanish and English. Spanglish.The characters in this book were very different from one another. That may seem like something weird to point out but in a lot of media, not just books, a lot of people of color get put into a box. And they're all expected to stay within that box. And after a while they all blend together. Not in this book. On the surface it may seem like they're all just stereotypes but throughout the story they all defy the stereotypes in one way or another. And they all do it differently. Also, Gigi Carmona is a queen.The only (very small) gripe I had with this book was the fact that the title is a little bit misleading. When I first picked up this book I thought it was going to be a love story. And in a way it was. It just wasn't the love story I was expecting. And maybe that was the point.In the end I think Sammy and Juliana in Hollywood is a coming-of-age story for the ages. I highly recommend it specially if you are someone who is really not into YA but you're still willing to give it a chance."}, {"userName": "Scott", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1031131-scott", "userReview": "Awww . . . Sammy and Juliana in Hollywood, how do I talk about you. You surprised me on most every page. But let me break you down.Pros:Great coming of age story.Nice setting, the barrio and Vietnam war time period.Great heartbreaking characters.good pacing to the suprising end of the first part, don't want to spoil it, but something happens about 50 pages in that is so shocking I was left breathless.Solid writing, very literary.Doesn't hold the readers hand and doesn't pull it's punches. Seems realistic and that makes it all the better.Cons:Large parts are in Spanish, this isn't a con persay, more a warning, and I like that he doesn't take the time to translate everything, because what's the point of writing in Spanish in the first place then. Have a translator handy if you don't speak Spanish. The first 50 pages are hard to read. Slow and predictable, but once you have gotten to that huge surprise it is well worth it.Very depressing. Can't just like 2 good things happen to Sammy. Seriously? Bad stuff upon bad stuff upon bad stuff is not good writing, it's just depressing. But Saenz does balance it all fairly nicely.Overuse of dumb images, The pigeon inside Sammy, The Aztec chin thing.Overall, I was impressed by this book. Once it hooked my attention I was really into it, but it took it's sweet time and I was actual a couple pages from giving up altogether. However, I don't know if it would really relate to kids today. The stuff about racism and having trouble fitting in would still be pertinent, but there are other parts that I think would just turn them off to this book. Like the first 50 pages. Not being able to relate Sammy and Juliana's plight to their own.

My heart aches for Sammy Santos. It's slow, but more in a way that lets the story breathe. There's no rush or crazy plot conflict to solve. There were times the book felt like loosely connected vignettes, but that's fine with me. I loved any snapshot into Sammy's life. And I adore the way his family was written.

I had to fold down the corners on so many pages that contain quotes that I love. My only critique now that I've freshly put it down is that it would have been interesting to hear more about discrimination and prejudice between white people and this Hispanic population.

Sammy, an introverted and pensive teenager lives in the Hollywood barrio in New Mexico with his father and little sister. Before the start of his senior year, he falls in love with Juliana Rios. But before school starts, she is brutally murdered be her own father. After her death, Sammy must come to terms with her death which reminds him of his mother\u2019s death. \u201cSammy and Juliana in Hollywood\u201d depicts the struggles and challenges of growing up and coming to terms with unfortunate circumstances surrounded himself, his friends and family. This book contained many meaningful themes that stood out to me. A particular one would be love and loss. Throughout the book, Sammy gradually loses his friends and family. He is a loyal and caring friend who at the best of his abilities takes care of his dad and little sister. I think through this theme I understand that nothing lasts forever and eventually everybody leaves. Though it may seem like morbid conclusion to come to, it\u2019s a sad reality that we must learn to accept. Another theme would be growth. Throughout the book, Sammy and friends really mature as young adults and they have learned to adapt to their situation and community. For example, losing one of his friends to murder, war, a heroin overdose and a car accident. He\u2019s experiencing difficulties in his life that I think everyone goes through. The author does a wonderful job of incorporating issues like racism and discrimination in the book and he brings awareness to these topics. I could really connect to this; as a child of immigrant parents who have been treated differently, underestimated and not given equal opportunities. Sammy is Mexican-American but his culture doesn\u2019t limit him. In fact, he strives to prove those who don\u2019t believe in him and his friends wrong. This is an important message as this tells readers to not succumb to other people\u2019s standards. This book not only connects to me personally but also to current social issues. In the story, two of Sammy\u2019s friends are brutally beaten up and ridiculed by a group of boys for being homosexual. Compared to 2018, being homosexual in the 1960's wasn\u2019t openly accepted and could even make you a target of brutality. With time and people\u2019s mentality and ethos changing being gay, lesbian, queer, etc. is now majorly accepted. But even with that, there is still a stigma around it and people who are not able to accept other\u2019s sexual identity. In conclusion I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It had a lyrical and poetical ambience to it that I look for and am attracted to when finding a book to read. Overall, I would recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Richie Partington", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1737220-richie-partington", "userReview": "24 November 2004 SAMMY & JULIANA IN HOLLYWOOD by Benjamin Alire Saenz, Cinco Puntos Press, August 2004, ISBN: 0-938317-81-4\"Man, man, man. I turned around and walked. Just kept walking.\"I was pissed. These guys, what was wrong with them anyway? What was it with all the fighting? So what if they were pissed off? I was pissed off, too. I was pissed off about a lot of things. About my mom. About Juliana. About living in Hollywood. About working all the time, and having to save every dime, every nickel, every penny, just so I could go to college. About having teachers and friends who looked at me like I was wasting my time by working so goddamned hard at being a good student. About being called the Librarian behind my back by every asshole who thought being a man meant ignoring the fact that he was born with a fucking mind. Damnit to hell! I was pissed off, too. But I didn't go around kicking people's asses just because I was pissed off. Shit, sometimes having these conversations with myself only made me madder. I lit a cigarette. Once I calmed down, I just enjoyed the walk. It was a nice night. Hot. And it smelled like rain.\"Thinking back on my own life, it seems as if the summer of 1968 was the last time that I was contented in that innocent, blissful fashion that is the true province of childhood. I spent large chunks of that summer--which for me fell between seventh and eighth grade--happily toiling away on my dad's residential construction sites. Occasionally I'd take some of my hard-earned cash, jump on my banana bike, and zoom through the local neighborhoods over to Modell's where they always had the latest 45s and LPs in their music department. I also spent a couple of weeks camping upstate near Gloversville, NY at Woodworth Lake Scout Reservation. But--most memorably--I got to spend a healthy portion of Summer 1968 hanging out on the deck Dad had recently built around the new pool in our backyard.\"Look over yonder, what do you see?The sun is arisin', most definitely.A new day is comin', people are changin',Ain't it beautiful? Crystal blue persuasion.\"--Tommy James and the ShondellsIt was one of those rectangular aboveground pools with a blue vinyl liner and a diving hole dug into the ground on one end. There were plenty of mornings when it was already scorching by nine or ten. I can still recall the soundtrack of those long, lovely summer days when I'd have MusicRadio WABC constantly cranked up and a sweating glass of O.J. waiting on the picnic table as I repeatedly tried to determine how many times I could swim back and forth underwater without coming up for air.\"You're just too good to be trueCan't take my eyes off of youYou'd be like heaven to touchI wanna hold you so muchAt long last love has arrivedAnd I thank God I'm aliveYou're just too good to be trueCan't take my eyes off of you\"--Frankie ValliMeanwhile, in 1968, during the summer preceding his senior year at Las Cruces High School in southern New Mexico, Sammy Santos hooks up with Juliana Rios.\"I remember her eyes, the gray of a sky about to let loose a storm. I remember the way she placed her finger on her bottom lip when she was lost in thoughts as dark as her eyes. I'd have given anything to live that close to her lips.\"The powerful and achingly tragic story Sammy recounts of Juliana Rios and that summer of '68 is but a mere preface in this stunning ode to growing up in the barrio--a neighborhood that some joker has named Hollywood. A tale told in five segments and focusing primarily on the people and events in Sammy's life during the year that begins that summer, I alternately laughed, cheered, and cried as Sammy and his Hollywood friends encounter the prejudices, the Church, the hormones, the War, the drugs, the violence, the music, the aspirations, and the dress code, while making their way through that year both inside and outside of the barrio.\"I need you baby and if it's quite alrightI need you baby to warm the lonely nightsI love you baby, trust me when I say\"Back-to-back readings of SAMMY AND JULIANA accompanied by a solid week of Frankie Valli echoing in my head has me absolutely in love with this book.\"You've got to change your evil ways, baby\"--SantanaBenjamin Alire Saenz creates a beautiful and gritty cast of Hollywood teens here, and the members of that cast are so well-drawn that I will long deal with memories of each and every one of them.And yet, they are all sooner or later upstaged by the tenacious little old lady who lives across the street from Sammy. In the long run, it is Mrs. Apodaca who arguably comes to exert the greatest influence on Sammy's life that year.\"One morning she handed out novenas in honor of the Blessed Mother to Susie Hernandez and Francisca (aka Frances) Sanchez as they passed in front of her house to catch the bus to go to school. 'Go to the priest,' she said firmly. She pointed at their skirts.\" 'God made my legs,' Susie said, then slapped her thigh as if with that slap she could make Mrs. Apodaca appreciate not only the danger but the beauty of a woman's legs.\" 'But who made the dress?' Mrs. Apodaca shot back.\"Actually, it wasn't so bad living across the street from Mrs. Apodaca. Any time I got bored, I'd wander out to the front porch. Sit. Wait. I was always rewarded for my patience. Something always happened. It was her habit to stop people as they passed in front of her house. She was a gatekeeper, and now, as I think about it, I swear she would have made one helluva border patrol officer. 'Who made that dress?' Even from across the street, I could hear her clearly, could see the deep furrows of her scowl, her face becoming a map of the world. 'Who made that dress?' \"In my own life, the summer of 1968--which had been preceded by those two assassinations--ended with the televised Chicago police riot outside of the Democratic National Convention. School began the following week, and my wonderful eighth grade American History teacher helped me to begin connecting the dots, yielding images of the country that forever shook me out of my childhood stupor. The beauty and power through which Benjamin Alire Saenz reveals what was happening in a faraway corner of America during that pivotal time in my own life, and in the life of our country, makes this the book that I'll be giving to our teen nieces and nephews for the holidays.\"She was singing from a different place. In a language that didn't matter a damn. But it mattered to Gigi. And it mattered to us--to Pifas and Rene and to Angel. La gloria eres tu. God, she could sing. And in the moonlight, she didn't seem like a girl at all. She was a woman with a voice. Any man would die just to hear that voice. I swear--just to hear it. I thought the world had stopped to listen to Gigi--Gigi Carmona from Hollywood. I could see tears rolling down Pifas' face. As pure as Gigi's voice. I could feel those wings inside me again--like they were coming back to life, like all they needed was just one beautiful song for them to get up and start beating again. Everything was so perfect, I mean really perfect. Maybe this was what the garden was like. Maybe this was the way the world should end. Not with me and my own thoughts, not with high school boys using their fists on each other, not with Pifas going off to war--but with the tears of boys falling to the beat of a woman's song, the sounds of guns and bombs and fists against flesh disappearing. This is the way the world should end: with boys turning into men as they listen to a woman sing.\"I wish Juliana was here.\"Richie Partingtonhttp://richiespicks.comBudNotBuddy@aol.com"}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8357496-lisa", "userReview": "Another wonderful story by Benjamin Alire S\u00e1enz about growing up in 1969.
