I only gave it a 4-star rating because there are parts where it drags on. But the meat-and-potatoes of it are stellar.Perhaps one of the quintessential works of Jewish Fiction, As a Driven Leaf was written by Rabbi Milton Steinberg, who was mostly an historian. This was his first foray into writing fiction, and in this book Rabbi Steinberg demonstrates a mastery not only of talmudic folklore, but also of Greco-Roman society, as well as the philosophies of both. The protagonist is Elisha ben Abuyah, who is the textbook case of an \"Apikores\" (literally \"Epicurean\", but connotation is more \"heathen\"). The Talmud tells us very little about Elisha. We know that his name was changed to \"Acher\" (lit. \"somebody else\"). Using the little information the Talmud gives us about him, Steinberg weaves a 400+ page tale about a tormented man, struggling between his Jewish culture and the Roman beliefs he eventually espoused. I first read this book as a freshman in high school. I was too young to truly appreciate it back then. In fact, one of my rabbis (who was raised a Reform Jew but later became Orthodox) warned us about Milton Steinberg. He warned us that the conclusions Rabbi Steinberg comes to are not in concordance with the Orthodox Jewish world. How prophetic, Steinberg would be one of the authors who shaped my current beliefs, which do not agree with Orthodoxy at all.Like the Grateful Dead's St. Stephen, Elisha is constantly in search for the truth--even if it means unpending all of his current beliefs. He was born to a Hellenist father, who made him learn Homer while all his friends learned Torah. When his father died, his religious uncle sent him away to yeshiva to learn under Rabbi Joshua ben Haninah. Eventually, Elisha himself became a rabbi. But little by little, he began to have his doubts. Midway through the book, he receives a traumatic epiphany (almost straight out of Gemara Kiddushin), which makes him decide \"there is no justice, there is no judge.\" And so, after getting excommunicated for publicly expressing his doubts, he moves to Antioch (the 4th biggest city in the Roman Empire).Exiled and shamed, Elisha tries to pick up the pieces. Quickly, he learns that Antioch is no bed of roses. He enjoyed the intellectual freedom, but the caprices and the hedonism were not for him. As his friend Pappas told him when he ran away from a bordello that his friends tried to lure him into, some part of Elisha still was a bit of a rabbi. So Elisha eventually embraces Stoicism and starts getting himself published. But then, after angering the Praetor, one Marcus Tinnaeus Rufus (or \"Turnusrufus\", as the Talmud calls him), Rufus completely turns his life upside-down!Elisha is a real tragic hero. He does not find the truth. He ends up a consummate skeptic. While I do not agree with the ending of the story, I still thank it for opening my mind to questioning everything. \"As a Driven Leaf\" is a must-read for anyone who is examining or reexamining any belief system. highly recommended!"}, {"userName": "Maya", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5018238-maya", "userReview": "Forward by Chaim PotokThe novel, based on Talmudic sources, admittedly heavily embellished and not holding strictly to pure factual occurrences, follows the life of Rabbi Elisha ben Abuyah, a Jew living during the time after the second Jewish temple had been destroyed and under the thumb of Roman occupation. Born to a father who rejected the Jewish faith and embraced Greek thought and motherless from an early age, he is taught to read Greek and appreciate pagan philosophies. At ten, his father dies and he is then cared for by his observant Jewish uncle. Immediately, the scrolls of his father\u2019s are burned and Elisha is steeped in the Jewish faith. It is seen as a blessing by those scholars around him that he has been rescued from pagan thought. He rises in prominence to eventually become an ordained Rabbi and then a member of the Sanhedrin, that prestigious body of Sages that rules over matters religious and civil within Palestine.Rabbi Elisha\u2019s faith begins to falter and he is compelled beyond even his own reasoning to find proof of Truth. He decides to search all philosophies, knowing that he charts a very dangerous course. He will invite chastisement and eventually personal ruin and excommunication if he persists in his search, causing those around him to fear that he is an apostate.The novel beautifully depicts the course of his life and his pursuit of knowledge and truth. I found myself strongly identifying with his passion and compulsion to learn even when those around him began to think the worst of him. While I believe we are given a mind by G-d and we are expected to use it, it becomes apparent that Elisha\u2019s mind begins to turn in on itself and tragedy after tragedy follows. One might begin to think that Steinberg is encouraging Elisha\u2019s pursuit, especially when he is desperate for answers, but others are so fearful of even his questions he cannot find a safe way to work out his faith within the context of the community of his fellow sages. At other times his initial logic \u201cmakes so much sense\u201d, but it becomes apparent that without faith, what appears as truth and logic rings hollow and leaves him without any kind of grounding even when that is exactly what the search was for originally.I strongly recommend this book for those that want to explore what life was like around 70-90 CE in Palestine and Antioch and as a philosophical treatment of faith and logic. I would also hope that those within faith communities would read it to learn how to treat someone who is questioning. In the more fundamental (and sometimes not so fundamental) denominations, fear of doubt and fear of anything different within the community can propel potential congregants to leave the community to find answers rather than remain and feel safe to work it out. This novel is extremely timely even though it was published sixty-seven years ago. It is rare for me to be so engrossed in a book that I cannot put it down, but in three days I devoured this one and it will find a permanent place on my bookshelf."}, {"userName": "Maggie Anton", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1280353-maggie-anton", "userReview": "I first read this novel before I studied Talmud, so I didn't realize it was based on actual Jewish texts. I was fascinated by Steinberg's descriptions of life in Roman Palestine, especially how the Jews lived, since there wasn't any other Jewish historical fiction from this time period. I wasn't so happy with the ending, never quite understanding why Elisha had to completely reject his religion when he couldn't reconcile it with Hellenism. Later, when I studied the Gemara where his story appeared, I was even less happy. The Talmud is quite clear that Elisha ascends to Paradise with Rabbi Akiva and their 2 younger colleagues, and that all except Akiva are traumatized by the experience, Elisha so much that he becomes an apostate. Yet Steinberg leaves this crucial scene out of \"As a Driven Leaf\" so we never understand what set Elisha on his difficult path."}, {"userName": "Salem", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1929199-salem", "userReview": "Basically, this book was written for me, so it's not surprising that I loved it.As a Driven Leaf was recommended to me by a rabbi who teaches an Jewish adult education course that I am taking. Two weeks ago we were studying the mitzvot (commandments), and we looked closely at the one in Deuteronomy 22:6-7:  If, along the road, you chance upon a bird's nest, in any tree or on the ground, with fledglings or eggs, do not take the mother together with her young. Let the mother go, and take only the young, in order that you may fare well and have a long life.This mitzvah takes a central role in the book, solidifying the main character's crisis of faith: Elisha ben Abuyah watches a young boy doing as G-d commands; however, instead of the promised long life, the boy falls out of the tree and dies. Thereafter, Elisha leaves his life as rabbi.Part I of the book explores Elisha's education and rise to membership in the Sanhedrin, the highest Jewish authority in the Roman empire. But even as he achieves the honor, Elisha is plagued by doubts, which culminate in witnessing the child's death. Part II is Elisha's life as as secular Greek in the Roman Empire, searching for meaning in classical philosophy and metaphysics. His loyalties -- to his people and to his adopted land -- are put to a final test during the bar Cochba rebellion that pitted the Jews against the Romans.Elisha ben Abuyah is an historical figure, as are most of his friends and colleagues (most notably, the sage Akiba). Steinberg's novel brings the rabbinical period to life, and Chaim Potok's excellent introduction clearly places the novel in its context in Jewish historical fiction."}, {"userName": "AdiTurbo", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2199883-aditurbo", "userReview": "This book has left me with a melancholy feeling and lots of pity for a man who was a free thinker, and who had suffered greatly because of it. As a Jew, I enjoyed learning more about the history of my people, and this book provided great detail and very lively descriptions, although sometimes too long. Many things in this book resonated with things that are happening to us or that we are doing to ourselves these days. As an atheist, I found myself entirely identifying with Elisha, although I can't agree with the message of this book that atheism may cause you to harm others, make immoral choices and do terrible things. As a philosophy fan, I found the explanations about the different philosophical methods of thinking as opposed to those of faith enlightening and well done. And as a reader, I found the book readable, moving and satisfying, although a little slow at some points. All in all, I think it is an important read for Jews, for people interested in any belief or philosophy, people who fight for freedom of thought, and anyone looking for a rich and fulfilling read, intense and well written."}, {"userName": "Chrisl", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11928354-chrisl", "userReview": "6/2/18 - Starting re-read, felt a connection with Williams' Stoner. Maybe it's just the wife.Stoner**Many decades ago, I explored the religion ... wasn't my path to be, but impressive passion ...Here be quotes from the foreward by Chaim Potok\"One day in March 1950 ... I overheard two students talking in Yiddish. ... 'Did you hear the news? Milton Steinberg died last night.' ... Really? He was young.' \"To which the first responded: 'Now they're punishing him for his books.'... \"Later that day, I searched for Milton Steinberg's name in the catalogue of the college library, and discovered that he was not listed. My query to the librarian elicited the terse response: 'We do not keep his books here.'\"So, Milton Steinberg was a Conservative rabbi. What could he have written to earn him such reproval from the guardians of my faith?\"...\"How strange that his books had eluded me, especially his novel. I was then reading my way through many literatures like a person possessed, and thought that someone in my school--a fellow student or an English professor--might have brought his work to my attention. In retrospect, I think quite probably they would have--were he not allied with Mordecai Kaplan's Reconstructionism, whose ideology, though it emphasized Jewish observance, denied the chosenness of the people Israel, the existence of a personal God, and the divine authorship of the Torah.\"I turned to the two books by Milton Steinberg. One, 'The Making of the Modern Jew,' published in the early 1930, was a work of history. The second was the novel, 'As a Driven Lead,' published in 1939.\" ... I turned with some apprehension to the novel. I was fine-tuned to fiction and knew that it was one thing to write a good history and something else entirely to write a good story. Moreover, who had ever heard of a rabbi taking on serious fiction!\"It did not take me long to realize that there was a story in the novel, a gripping story. But as I read it that first time, I found myself becoming slowly convinced that the novel was far more than a mere story, that its central drama--a conflict between religious and pagan ideas, between faith and reason, between postulates of creed and science, as experienced by the early Talmudic sage Elisha ben Abuyah--was emblematic not only of all Jewish history but probably of Milton Steinberg himself. The novel seemed to me to be an extension of the same quest he had set for himself in 'The Making of the Modern Jew:' an exploration of Judaism in conflict with a vigorous and powerful surrounding culture, in this instance the pagan world of Greece and Rome. Steinberg had traveled back in time to arrive at the cradle of Rabbinic Judaism--and his hero was a heretic.\"Little is known about the historical Elisha ben Abuyah--the central character of the novel. His father appears to have been a wealthy Jerusalemite ... He was a student of Greek, loved Greek poetry, and apparently had more than a surface knowledge of horses, architecture, and wine. He read forbidden books ...\"... \"The novel is in essence a Bildungsroman in which we witness the forming of the mind and heart of a Rabbinic sage ... It is a novel of ideas and passions ... an often fiery confrontation of cultures--in a struggle of contradictory Jewish and pagan core concepts about the world and the human experience ...\"**original review -Another of the many books I'd like to reread. Here's the copied Kirkus ReviewKIRKUS REVIEWThe extraordinary success of The Nazarene will in a sense pave the way for this book, which also has a Palestinian setting, and a religious motive. The period is later -- the early second century -- and the story deals with Elisha ben Abuyah, Jewish rabbi, a dissenter whose life was torn by internal struggles towards faith. It is a book which should appeal to the market of Lion Feuchtwanger's The Jew of Rome, for Elisha ben Abuyah was virtually another Josephus, betraying his people to the Romans, despised by both sides. A childhood under Hellenistic influence; an adolescence and early youth under strict Jewish teachers, a marriage without love, and the beginning of a lifelong attempt to rationalize his beliefs. The story of a failure, of the ultimate discovery that Faith is essential to Life, and that not all elements can be fitted into the pattern of Euclid, that reason alone cannot control life. Semi-historical, semi-biographical, but written as fiction, with whole periods -- unknown to historians -- filled in. Not a book for the average reader, but a book that those interested in far off periods of history which have their parallels today, and in the search for a faith as a motive of life, will find interesting and challenging."}, {"userName": "Helen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2429268-helen", "userReview": "I read this back in high school a thousand years ago, as all my friends did. Rabbi Elisha Ben Abuya is one of the most tragic and charismatic characters in historical Judaism. One of four legendary Mishanaic-era rabbis who undertook the study of Kabbalah, Elisha Ben Abuya was the one who became a heretic.(Of the other three, it is said that one went mad, one died, and one was the great sage Rabbi Akiva.)

The whole struggle to find a solid personal philosophical/spiritual foundation in the middle of conflicting cultures and beliefs was fascinating. However, the book's ending was profoundly disappointing to me. Elisha (the main character) and many of his friends and family all suffer tragically from his decision to explore Greek and Roman philosophy.Were his explorations wrong? It's hard for me to think that. I read this book a few years ago and have been wrestling with this question ever since. Is it wrong to be driven to search out truth? And yet [New Thought!], maybe it could be. Maybe it is wrong if one is so focused on finding truth that he is blinded to the injustice and oppression going on around him.Maybe that's the key to the book. Elisha originally turned away from Judaism because he witnessed an act of injustice. Then, after a lifetime of exploring pagan philosophies, he realized that many of the attractive things associated with those philosophies were worthless because they ignored key concepts of justice and mercy. The ideas and truths were more important and more beautiful to those cultures than people were. Maybe it isn't wrong to search out religious truths, but it is wrong to be so focused on the quest for ideas and truths that we ignore the social injustices going on around us.That reminds me of something else. I read somewhere that we shouldn't search out unanswerable questions about God. Maybe that's because it uses up our precious, limited time that we could be using to study things that we can find answers to. Things that help us to \"do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly before our God\"."}, {"userName": "Jan Rice", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5864678-jan-rice", "userReview": "Begins in 80 CE, 10 years after the destruction of the Temple, and goes on through the reigns of Trajan and Hadrian, covering the periods of the Diaspora and Bar Kokhba revolts. \"There is no Truth without Faith.

It doesn't belong, but that's just the point-it shouldn't belong. There's nothing logical or reasonable about faith, and that's why it's so important.

During this period, the Mishnah--the compendium of legal discussions and teachings that formed the foundation of Rabbinic Judaism and of the Talmud--took shape. I found As a Driven Leaf to be intellectual stimulating, historically revealing, and personally affecting.The protagonist is Rabbi Elisha be Abuyah, one of the brightest figures in the Sanhedrin (the Rabbinical decision-making body), who, together with Akiva, Simeon Ben Zoma, and Simeon Ben Azzai, according to the Mishnah, \u201cwent into the Pardes\u201d to immerse themselves in a quest for deeper understanding of the Torah. One Simeon died, the other Simeon went mad, and Elisha became an apostate, rejected by the Jewish community. Only Akiva emerged intact.Although today the term \u201cclash of civilizations\u201d is an overused clich\u00e9, As a Driven Leaf is about such a clash that took place when Palestine, along with the entire Eastern Mediterranean (and much more besides), was under Roman rule. Elisha, as depicted by Steinberg, grows up absorbing both Hellenistic and traditional rabbinic influences. As he reaches adulthood, he finds that he cannot accept traditional religious authority. Instead, he dedicates himself to the study of Greek philosophy in the hope of arriving at a rational foundation for understanding of the world. The Jews differ from the Romans in more than their approach to religion, morality, and epistemology. The Jews are an oppressed nation near the edge of the Roman Empire, struggling to preserve vestiges of their autonomy and hoping to rebuild their ruined Temple. The Romans, by contrast, rule the most of the known world with a system of laws and relatively fair justice, and have total power over the Jews and many other nations. Thus, Elisha, while ultimately concerned with philosophy and the nature of truth, is also sitting on a fault line in a powderkeg situation of ruling power vs. oppressed group. The traditional Jews, as portrayed here, are divided between more moderate leaders who believe that open rebellion against the Romans would be an act of communal suicide, and hotheads who are eager to rise up in rebellion. Elisha, who doubts that the Jewish people can possibly survive, becomes a target of the hotheads, who succeed in having him excommunicated from the Jewish community.As a Driven Leaf is almost unbearably sad at points, as the reader witnesses the slow deterioration of Elisha\u2019s situation. It is also a touching book in the way that it depicts Elisha\u2019s friendships with other Jewish scholars. These friendships are severely bent, but not broken by Elisha\u2019s break with the Rabbinic community."}, {"userName": "Dani Meier", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13159-dani-meier", "userReview": "I greatly enjoyed this book. Steinberg did an amazing job describing the characters and giving me a full picture of all these grand tannaitic sages. Although Steingberg took some liberties with the plot, it seems he really stuck to the general character descriptions as depicted in gemaras and mishnas and I really got a great picture of what it was like to live in that time. Moreover, Elisha ben Avuya's struggle was so great and so interesting and even so relevant to today's times. I am merely left wondering, would Elisa ben Avuya still have become Acher had Modern Orthodoxy existed back in his time?! Or rather would so many of us have become \"acher\" as well?! Lastly, my only criticism, is that at times i felt as though steinberg were trying to get across his reconstructionist judaism agenda, and while it did seem to mimic elisha's struggles, i couldnt help but wonder if Steinberg was transferring his own woes and conflicts onto this tannaitic character.

I liked how the author didn't take sides but just presented the story and question: should you renounce your faith if you don't believe in it anymore?"}, {"userName": "Kandace", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/873415-kandace", "userReview": "This is perhaps one of my favorite books ever. I read it for a history class although it's historical fiction. It takes place about 70AD and shows the role of faith in everybody's life, whether they be devout Jews or the Roman intellectual and cultural elite. I found the story fascinating from a historical standpoint and the ultimate end to the journey almost soul-shocking and, personally, testimony building. I had never thought of faith in the manner it was discussed, trying not to give away the ending because I think EVERYBODY should read it, although it's pretty long."}, {"userName": "Ellen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1761563-ellen", "userReview": "Very well researched and written book about historical people, places, times as the basis but fleshed out with believable fiction. Although I slogged through the middle and had to make the effort to finish it, I'm glad I read this book. Reading about how Jews might have lived amongst the Greeks and Romans was intriguing. Also the plot - that a learned, affluent, highly respected and pious Rabbi could reach a turning point in his life where he absolutely questions his religion and way of life - was thought-provoking and realistically written."}, {"userName": "Alberto Mansur", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24155391-alberto-mansur", "userReview": "The timeless struggle between reason and faith, the need to understand, to make sense of a morality based on religion and its tenets about right and wrong, about a God-made plan for the universe and its rationality. I first read it in high school and came back to it again twenty years later, this book remains a seminal piece of who I am and an example of how there's places where faith alone is not enough and of how reason can only go so far."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5247995-paul", "userReview": "I have some strongly mixed feelings about this book - the female characters seemed mere foils for the men and some of the situations and plots were overly cliched. That said, Steinberg does a great job of putting you into this world and Elisha ben Abuyah's quest. For a book that's obviously so personal, really tremendous how he didn't allow his alter-ego character to go without serious, serious flaws. Some of the religious-philosophical discussions are just fascinating."}, {"userName": "Bruce", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5951931-bruce", "userReview": "This is a book about rabbinical Judaism around the 100 AC. It is fiction, but it was written by a rabbi and is faithful to the teachings and historical flavor of that era. It is a story of a rabbi who ultimately losses his faith in order to follow Greek reasoning only to find out in the end that Greek reasoning would lead him back to his faith. It is an amazing read and I highly recommend it for those who are interested."}, {"userName": "MarMir", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14983565-marmir", "userReview": "This novel is very good at presenting the philosophical differences between the Hebrew and Hellenic view of life. By making the protagonist an expert in both, the author gets to make a compelling argument for each world view. I am only giving this book 3 stars because I found it lacking as a work of literature. The dialogue, in particular, seemed rather forced, as did the \"love story\"."}], "description": "The age of the Talmud is brought to life in a breathtaking saga. This masterpiece of modern fiction tells the gripping tale of renegade talmudic sage Elisha ben Abuyah's struggle to reconcile his faith with the allure of Hellenistic culture. Set in Roman Palestine, As a Driven Leaf draws readers into the dramatic era of Rabbinic Judaism. Watch the great Talmudic sages at work in the Sanhedrin, eavesdrop on their arguments about theology and Torah, and agonize with them as they contemplate rebellion against an oppressive Roman rule. But Steinberg's classic novel also transcends its historical setting with its depiction of a timeless, perennial feature of the Jewish experience: the inevitable conflict between the call of tradition and the glamour of the surrounding culture. In his illuminating foreword, specially commissioned for this edition, Chaim Potok stresses the contemporary relevance of As a Driven Leaf: This novel of ideas and passions. . . retains its ability to enter the heart of pious and seeking Jew alike. Synagogues everywhere are adopting As a Driven Leaf for group study.", "title": "As a Driven Leaf", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/100065.As_a_Driven_Leaf", "average": 4.1, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347463821l/100065.jpg", "reviews": 164, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/57718.Milton_Steinberg", "name": "Milton Steinberg"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7385.Chaim_Potok", "name": "Chaim Potok"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fiction", "Literature", "Religion", "Judaism"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/100065.As_a_Driven_Leaf", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27817646", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/479624.As_a_Driven_Leaf", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1077452.Basic_Judaism", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7934254-the-prophet-s-wife", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/135339.Partisan_Guide_to_the_Jewish_Problem", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5782784-the-making-of-the-modern-jew", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10997225-anatomy-of-faith", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
