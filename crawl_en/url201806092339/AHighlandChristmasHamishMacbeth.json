Having already firmly established with readers the tall, redheaded constable of Lochdubh with little ambition, and the quirky villagers he must contend with in the remote highlands, Beaton focuses on giving fans of the series a magical novella as a Christmas gift. Reading this is like listening to a breezy Dave Koz Christmas offering on the stereo while trimming the tree.It\u2019s dark and wintery in Lochdubh as Christmas approaches and the Calvinist element is sucking the spirit right out of the holiday for Hamish. His mother has won a soap slogan contest, and a free Christmas holiday, but Hamish can\u2019t join his folks because he has to take over Constable McGregor\u2019s patch in Cnothon as well as his own. McGregor has come down with a bad appendix, putting the kibosh on any Christmas plans for Hamish. And with no lights, no trees, no carols, no secular trimmings at all \u2014 except behind closed doors, so as not to get an earful from the pious \u2014 it isn\u2019t feeling much like Christmas to our favorite Highland constable.When a Christmas tree and lights slated for the nearby village is stolen, Hamish is in no mood to be trifled with. It does seem trifling, however, when an old biddy named Mrs. Gallager reports her cat missing and insists Hamish find it. Intuitive as ever, Hamish senses there\u2019s more to her being frightened than she\u2019s telling. He also senses she\u2019s lonely. When a young schoolgirl named Morag, with parents so dogmatic she hasn\u2019t any friends, may be the culprit in one of the cases, what\u2019s Hamish to do but put two lonely people together for a very special Christmas.There\u2019s a lot more here, including Hamish\u2019s romance with a local school teacher, a busload of carolers, and a big Christmas dinner that restores the holiday spirit. Hamish is still grieving over Towser in this one, but the ending offers more surprises in this charming and breezy Christmas in the Highlands with Hamish and all the regulars we\u2019ve come to enjoy over the years. This novella is a wonderful Christmas bauble for fans of the series. If you\u2019re not a fan already, this might make you one. Great fun, and highly recommended!"}, {"userName": "Florence (Lefty) MacIntosh", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10856439-florence-lefty-macintosh", "userReview": "[Someone pinched Mrs. Gallagher\u2019s cat.

This novella is a good holiday read, with the rural Scottish policeman Hamish Macbeth not just solving some (minor) mysteries but also involved in his community.

The hero, PC MacBeth, has more to worry about from his unreasonable and nasty boss than any criminals, apart from one near mishap when apparently his spectral dog comes to the rescue. Having dropped into this, not realising it was so late in the series and just a novella, I found it rather light though it was easy enough to pick up on the situation - the PC unlucky in love and stuck on duty over Christmas in a community where the Calvinist spirit lingers and it is considered unseemly to celebrate in what is viewed a pagan manner. He manages to do some good on that front, helping both a little girl and a frightened and isolated old lady.It was a light pre-Christmas read and at least didn't have the ghastly Agatha Raisin of the author's other series who screams instead of speaking. So an OK 2-star read for me."}, {"userName": "Shiloah", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/973558-shiloah", "userReview": "Now this was a cozy Christmas mystery.

Ugh I know he won't, but I wish he could get over her or she would stop leading him on. The cat and mouse game is getting tiresome. As for the small mysteries, I like how they were tied up. These crimes may seem small, but it takes someone like Hamish who actually pays attention to the small stuff to figure out the answers.

Here\u2019s what\u2019s going on: As Lochdubh and the surrounding Highland villages are mostly made up of Calvinist, Christmas, much to Hamish\u2019s disappointment, is off-limits as it\u2019s still thought of as a pagan holiday. When Cnothan decides to put up a Christmas tree and fairy lights, the town\u2019s in an uproar when they discover that they have been stolen, thus Hamish is sent out to investigate. Although he has his hands full when Mrs. Gallagher, a crabby old lady who lives alone, reports her cat has gone missing and Hamish takes it upon himself to get to the root of Mrs. Gallagher\u2019s problems. As his investigation goes forth, Hamish finds himself\u2014with the help of the new teacher\u2014spreading a little Christmas cheer to a lonely little girl. I\u2019ve been a massive fan of M.C. Beaton\u2019s Hamish Macbeth Mysteries for years and I have to say that this one was such a delight a lovely little edition to the series.While the series is a cozy mystery series, this one is a lot lighter than the others. There\u2019s no death, destruction, or mayhem just a missing cat, a crotchety old lady, a lonely little girl who was never allowed to celebrate Christmas, a nicked Christmas tree, and some stolen fairy lights. Oh, and a new schoolteacher that\u2019s taken a shine to Hamish. And to make things a tad more interesting, Priscilla\u2014Hamish\u2019s on-again-off-again girlfriend who I would love to see take a long walk off a short pier\u2014decides to reenter his life. If you\u2019re a fan of the Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, you will delight in visiting Lochdubh again. If you\u2019re new to the series, you will get a lovely glimpse of a little Highland village filled with unique and memorable residents. One thing that I love about this series is that Beaton truly beings in the Scottish Highlands to life. The dialect, the scenery, and the characters are true gems of the Highlands. So, this is book 16 in the series but, fear not, this book works brilliantly as a standalone. Although do be warned, if you\u2019re expecting the Hamish Macbeth from the telly show, book-Hamish is a tad bit different but just as lovable. Overall, this was heartwarming edition to this series and I\u2019m so glad that I finally had a chance to read it. It\u2019s a novella, so it a bit shorter than the others in the series, but it\u2019s well-rounded and doesn\u2019t leave you wanting more. If you\u2019re looking for a unique Christmas read, give this one a go."}, {"userName": "Kenny", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27336185-kenny", "userReview": "Cozy, fun. Sometimes it's nice to have a very gentle book in which nothing much happens, but what does is nice. This is one of those. The series of Hamish MacBeth (a show I never watched when it came on 20 years ago. Even now I may be at the young end of the demographic) isn't one I've ever read, and after this short, warm/fuzzy book I'd do so again. It's hardly dark or gritty - someone's cat has gone missing, and some Christmas lights have been stolen. There's still time for a few good digs at the Calvinists disapproving of everything, including fun, and there's always the undercurrent of the religious bigotry that's steadfastly refusing to die off. But this is feelgood stuff, and I'll take a bit of schmaltz at this time of year.Unthreatening, and unchallenging. But in a good way.

There is a lost cat to contend with, and some Christmas decorations have been stolen from a nearby village for which Hamish has temporary responsibility, and that's plenty to keep our inquisitive lawman busy. Moreover, Hamish soon enough finds out why one of the village ladies is such a grouch, and cleverly pairs her up with a teenaged girl who's in Dutch with her parents, much to the benefit of both.

Hamish is of course a veritable saint compared to AR, but there are plenty of grouchy types around too.

I don't quite understand the conflict with his boss, but i'm sure it's made clear in another of the installements.This particular one is a feel-good light Christmas mystery.
