They are in every sense of the phrase: displaced persons, and remain so all their lives. They meet and bond with each other in a wretched boarding school. In London they spend their childhood and adolescent years with Hartmann's Aunt Marie, before moving on to lives as successful businessmen, though their business is a frivolous one, low-brow greeting cards at one point, that neither takes seriously. The overarching theme for Hartmann is one of sensuous burial in the present as a means of avoiding unpleasant memories. Yvette, his wife, is deliberately out of step with the liberated women of her generation. She has a severe deficit in the empathy department; and her shallowness is admirably reflected in her materialism, which makes her a perfect fit for Hartmann. Everything with Yvette is appearance, surface, display. Everything with Hartmann is pleasure, indulgence, release. Fibich by contrast is someone who has not left his past behind. He is haunted by the Shoah, particularly the loss of his parents. He suffers keenly all his life from what psychologists call \"survivor guilt.\" He wishes to understand it, but it's too much cognitive dissonance that will never lend itself to neat answers. (One is reminded of the guard in Auschwitz who says to Primo Levi: \"There is no why here.\") The woman Fibich marries, Christine, is Aunt Marie's niece and a more self-effacing and humble character you are unlikely to come across this side of Dickens; though she is without the unbearable tics Dickens gives his characters, or the cloying cheerfulness. Fibich meets Christine when she arrives every Friday to help Aunt Marie prepare her only dish: braised tongue \u00e0 l'orientale. She stays with Fibich during the aunt's precipitous decline and death, and by then they are bound to each other by mutual pain and loss. Life for Brookner's characters, some of them, is a constant risk and worry. Whatever they do they are marked by a certain paralysis by analysis, stuck to the point of inaction. Though they try they can never remedy their affliction. Such are Fibich and Christine, such is also Hartmann, though Yvette is all instinct, and intuitive grasping. As for the writing, the novel all but leaps to life in your hands. Brookner is such an efficient writer; by p. 84 she has gone through the upbringing, childhood and adult psychological life of all four main characters. The section in which Christine and Fibich have a son of their own, Toto, whose sheer life force all but bowls them over, is dazzling. Toto's familiar is Yvette, with whom he shares an adoration for surfaces. He wants to be an actor, and one has to admit that seems perfect for this debauched Narcissus. This is one of my favorite Brookner novels and I highly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7364610-becky", "userReview": "This really is a compassionate beautiful book which will touch your heart. It's central themes are of how to live with a troubled past, friendship, marriage, parenthood and accepting the aging process. The potential for it to present these in a sickly manner is immense and yet is totally avoided here. The faults and qualities of each character are explored in a manner which makes each of them seem totally real. For a novel of only moderate length emotions and events are covered with a delicate and considered touch while being fully explored.

Published in 1988, Latecomers was inspired by the Kindertransport, which evacuated Jewish children from Germany to Britain during the Second World War.Helen Dunmore has written a lovely introduction to the volume, in which she calls Latecomers 'a moving, compassionate portrayal of how we confront the past and live with the present'. She goes on to say that 'The brilliance of Latecomers lies in the way every cherished domestic detail is set against an immense dark canvas.'Hartmann and Fibich have been best friends since meeting at the English school they both attended. Both are named Thomas, hence Brookner's decision to call them by their surnames. Of them, Dunmore writes 'These two, united against the miseries of the school, become each other's family and remain so for the rest of their lives.' Hartmann is the first character whom we meet. Brookner writes that at this point, 'He was now middle-aged, in the closing stages of middle-age, even old, he daringly thought. He had an impressionistic attitude towards his age, as he did towards his daughter's marriage, sometimes resigned to it, sometimes deciding to ignore it entirely.'The men 'respond to their shared history in different ways', and are markedly different characters. Hartmann is confident, taking an awful lot of pleasure from food; Fibich is more timid, and has an unhealthy relationship with food, hoarding it but finding the process of eating rather a chore. 'Fibich,' writes Brookner, 'with his anxious mournful temperament, had nurturing instincts, although what he longed for was to be in receipt of those instincts from someone else. Yet it seemed that this would never be.' The contrast between both men, despite being so close, did work well, but they felt like rather typical characters; there was very little about either which surprised me whilst reading.Brookner also follows several close family members of both Hartmann and Fibich, and whilst this gives the book a little more scope, it feels like rather an inward-facing novel. As ever, Brookner appears more concerned with how people feel than what they do. Despite the novel looking rather different on the face of it, there are still rather a lot of similarities which can be drawn between Latecomers and her other novels: portraits of people, albeit largely men rather than women, are presented at length here; the style of Brookner's prose is rather old-fashioned, and on occasion a little stuffy; and there is actually relatively little included with regard to the plot of the book.Despite the Kindertransport being one of the elements which drew me toward Latecomers, it is barely mentioned; rather, the novel begins when Hartmann and Fibich are already in England. I thought that the Kindertransport, as well as elements of the Holocaust which still affect both boys despite their being in a different country, would be more of a focus than they were. So much more could have been made of these aspects, making the novel stronger as a result. Brookner's oversight really let Latecomers down for me.Whilst Dunmore believes that there is 'a good deal of comedy in this essentially tragic novel', I must admit that from a modern perspective, I did not find it overly amusing. The asides which Brookner clearly intended to be humorous felt very dated. There are certainly some acerbic remarks which have stood the test of time, but, like much of Brookner's fiction, Latecomers is very of its time, and does not translate that well into the twenty-first century. Of course, some of what she writes about is still relevant, but Latecomers, overall, feels like a very secluded 1980s novel, a little underwhelming and predictable in both its characters and plot."}, {"userName": "Hugh", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32318315-hugh", "userReview": "I wanted to read this after reading a recent Guardian article on Brookner's novels other than the Booker winner Hotel du Lac, which was the only one I had read. This is a poised and reflective study of memory, loss and how different people handle it. At its centre are Hartmann and Fibich, lifelong friends and business partners who met as schoolboy refugees from Germany in the Kindertransports. Brookner contrasts the \"voluptuary\" Hartmann with the haunted brooding Fibich, and gets inside the minds of all of her characters, drawing warm and humorous portraits of a close family against the backdrop of darker events."}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2969963-maria", "userReview": "Absolutely perfect."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/281393-jim", "userReview": "This is my fourth Brookner and it won\u2019t be my last. There\u2019s been no logic to my selection, just whatever one happens to come my way, and it\u2019s pretty easy to see why those who like her really like her but also why her detractors accuse her of simply writing the same book over and over. Her palate is not a broad one and you can think of her as limited or you can call her a specialist; I\u2019m not sure at this stage in her life either description would worry her because this is what she\u2019s done and you can take her or leave her. I think she\u2019s probably my favourite female author. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve read more than two books by any other woman and the list of female authors I have read is not an extensive one but I do find myself drawn back to this woman. I could easily pick up another book by her tomorrow.What amazes me about her\u2014and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s too strong a word (hence the five stars)\u2014is her ability to write page after page of what really amounts to little more than description\u2014and minute descriptions at that\u2014and yet keep my interest. I start to bore myself if I have to write more than a couple of sentences and I think this is why she continues to fascinate me because she does what I can\u2019t do and does it so well. Latecomers is a family saga in essence despite the fact she gets through these lives in a mere 224 pages and yet someone manages to devote and entire chapter to a shopping trip and it not feel either out of place or overkill. She begins with the book\u2019s central characters, Hartmann and Fibich, who come to London as German refugees, meet at boarding school and become lifelong friends, closer than most brothers. I only highlighted one extract as I was reading the book:In the office both Myers and Goodman were apt to be stimulated to unusual loquacity on the subject of past days, days from the beginnings of their lives, and their anecdotes struck Hartmann and Fibich as uninteresting, insignificant. Both felt cut off from such attachments, and also from the need to sentimentalize them, knowing instinctively how endangered they were in this respect. Nostalgia is only for the securely based. Neither men can remember much of their past. Fibich, for example, clings to \u201can image of himself as a very small, very plump boy, engulfed in a large wing chair which he knew to be called the Voltaire, feeling lazy, replete, and secure in the dying light of a winter afternoon.\u201d Hartmann \u201cfrom his earliest days \u2026 remembered scenes that might have been devised by Proust\u201d but of the two of them he dwells the least on that time; \u201che had survived: that was all that mattered in any life.\u201d They become very successful\u2014firstly in the unlikely profession of greeting cards, \u201cgreetings cards, of a cruel and tasteless nature, which [pay] their way very nicely for about twenty years, until Hartmann, who did little work but was valued for his \nFingerspitzengef\u00fchl\n [lovely term], his flair, his sixth sense, suggested that the market in this commodity was self-limiting, and that there were fortunes to be made in photocopying machines.\u201d They marry wives that suit their personalities who somehow also manage to become friends, have kids\u2014the wrong kids it has to be said and by that I mean the Hartmanns would\u2019ve been happier with the Fibichs\u2019 son and the Fibichs would\u2019ve been happier with the Hartmanns\u2019 daughter\u2014watch them grow up, marry and have children of their own. Mostly they manage to be proud of their families or at least never too ashamed. Despite never being short of a bob or two\u2014they don\u2019t have to think twice about buying a flat for their kids or hiring a nanny to help them out\u2014these two men live basically ordinary lives which revolve around work, food and appearances.Both men are called Thomas and so refer to each other by their surnames\u2014as, interestingly, do their wives\u2014but I do think Brookner is making a point by giving both men the same name\u2014I say this because I did exactly the same in my own novel Milligan and Murphy where both brothers are called John\u2014because it suggests that they\u2019re two halves of the same composite individual and the simple fact is they do complement each other very nicely. They buy flats in the same building and spend much of their spare time in each other\u2019s company. The odds of them finding two wives who could accept each man\u2019s very different friend is nothing short of miraculous. Of the two main characters\u2014although to be fair entire chapters are devoted to the wives and children\u2014I was drawn to Fibich because he\u2019s the one who struggles the most with who he is. He\u2019s the one who, in his sixties, ends up having to take trip back to Berlin to face his past, a thing although Hartmann is supportive of he would never need to do. To be fair I couldn\u2019t really relate to anyone in the book\u2014the two I disliked the most were Hartmann\u2019s wife, \u201cYvette, who possesse[d] an almost fabulous self-regard, a wonderful body and a childlike lack of sexual response,\u201d and Fibich\u2019s son who could be similarly described although he does have a more grown-up (and modern) attitude towards sex. Everyone is wrapped up in his or her own wee world and although this is me calling the pot black, being that way is fine but reading about self-absorbed people can be a bit wearing which, again, is when Brookner surprises me because she holds my interest. I\u2019m not sure I ever got to the stage of caring about these people but I was absorbed by them.So, five stars. Had I reviewed this on my blog I might\u2019ve been a bit more cautious realising that the book\u2019s not going to be to everyone\u2019s tastes but on Goodreads I\u2019m more subjective. I liked it. If I could\u2019ve managed to get through the book in a single day I would\u2019ve."}, {"userName": "Chris Gager", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5295008-chris-gager", "userReview": "A while ago I was perusing the book shelves(which I straighten out when I go there) of the stuff trailer at our local transfer station(dump) and spied a veritable pile of Anita Brookners - eight in all. I'd vaguely heard of her so I took them home - rescued really, as they throw all the books away when there are too many of them. They've sat on my bookshelves unread until now. I've been reading R. Russo's memoir \"Elsewhere\" and he mentions AB several times. Apparently he recommends her writing, so here I go ...So far I'm very much enjoying my first \"Brookner\" a lot. Who are these people she writes about? They seem to be some of those \"English middle-class nobodies\" that Eleanor Bron was referring to in \"Two for the Road.\" And yet, AB manages quite nicely to make their lives ever so interesting. She's witty, perceptive, caring and respectful of the humanity of her subjects and its easy to see why Richard Russo likes her stuff. She takes her time in building each of the backstories of her four protagonists and begins to weave the threads together. Henry Green and Anita Brookner - two very nice discoveries for me lately!- Alice Munro, Alice McDermott, Iris Murdoch, Anne Tyler ...Moving along and still not a lot going on here, just people living their challenging lives. Being themselves seems to be enough of a challenge. Toto seems to be the one who will spur some action, probably not in a happy way either. To read and enjoy this you've got to be \"down\" with AB's way of writing. Back and forth, here and there, back-filling and deepening our understanding of her 4(make that 6) characters. Reminds me of William Trevor with more words and fewer ominous empty spaces. As with WT, however, you need to read every word. Also, this is very funny at times. Humor is not usually an aspect of Trevor's writing.- The Fibich/father-Toto/son contrast is excellent. Toto is a great creation - reminds me of Wacker in Nobody's Fool. Pure id on the loose.- One theme here is the tenacious grip that the past has on the lives and personalities of the characters. But also, how the accidents of genetics may produce a surprise like Toto, who seems to be unrelated to either of his parents.Finished the other night with this excellent book. I'm so glad I have many other AB novels on my shelf to choose from after reading my first one. I'll give this a 4.25* rating, which rounds down to 4*. Why not a 5*?

Brookner upbeat for once, a delight.The book is about two Kindertransport children, Hartman and Fibitch. It slowly expands to cover their wives and their children. There is the usual Brooknerian (?) lack of a plot. Mostly we read about their thoughts and motivations, and anything that does happen is entirely banal and serves only to reveal some hitherto unexplored psychological angle. Hartman is vivacious and carefree, Fibitch anxious and submissive. Each marries a woman similar to himself, but their children are their opposites. This has many things to recommend it, of which I will note three. First, Brookner is a master stylist, her writing compressed and at the same time rhythmic. She manages to remain just on the right side of sententious, a quality I suspect achieved through the strict avoidance of cliches. This of course is true of her other books, or at least the ones that I have read (past a certain point in her career she apparently wrote only about unloved women, a theme which can only excite so much interest. Still I enjoy them tremendously because of the way they are written).Second, here (and elsewhere too) it is clear that Brookner saw two distinct types of person, one self-interested, assertive, and dominant, the other anxious, selfless, and submissive. I am also fairly confident she saw herself as the latter (useless as this type of speculation is supposed to be). This is not an uncommon mindset, I probably share it or so I am told. The regular tendency of the more submissive types is to view themselves as morally superior to the dominant ones. Indeed at the root of all submissive behaviour lies a desire to be liked and valued, to be \"good\" so that you may be seen as cherished for your goodness. One reason like Brookner so much is that she humanises the self-interested type from the perspective of the submissive. Fibitch's admiration of Hartman, and Brookner's portrayal of the latter, are prime example - the relationship between the two is completely devoid of bitterness. Each accepts his role and cherishes the other. It might be an unrealistic conception of human relations, but Brookner makes it sounds extremely credible. So I guess it helps me get rid of my own bitterness.The foregoing is probably me being a cuckoo amateur psychologist. Third, Latecomers stands out from the rest of her books because of its warmth. In the Brookner books I have usually been confronted with an unhappy woman who cannot deal with relations between the sexes, or one who cannot conform to someone's expectations of her. She then comes to terms with her position and is overcome by a melancholia which persists until the end of the book. There is nothing of the kind here - melancholia is there, but all of the characters want to be happy, and a good half genuinely are. I should also say that there are bits that are simply funny - pretty much everything that Yvette (Hartman's wife) does stirs a smile, some of it is laugh-out-loud funny.I started going through her work last year and abandoned it at some point thinking I had seen it all and it is something I might return to later, I think I was wrong and also that this time might be now."}, {"userName": "Kyc", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18371391-kyc", "userReview": "Anita Brookner was an enigma. She's such a fine stylist that you almost forgive her anything, and her novels are always well honed but at the end of most one has a sense that she has said that before, and maybe better. Latecomers is another such novel that she produced at the rate of one every year or so, all the way until her death. It's a permutation of her perennial theme of loneliness, of two Jewish males who settled from Germany to Britain, here interweaved with the Holocaust (even though peripherally), in parts beautifully observed, yet in the last resort there's a mournful, almost moribund feel to it. If this comes at the end of a long life and career then it might sum up a literary life aptly and poignantly. This however arrives midway through Brookner's late-starting career and it seems to be a prototype of a life unlived that Brookner seemed to be quietly grieving over, book after book. The sad thing is that this grievance appears autobiographical, and that it reappears once every year under a different guise. One longs for Ms Brookner to write something more life-affirming but now that she's gone, we have only these novels to treasure, the upshot which tears me both ways."}, {"userName": "Rosamund", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15102850-rosamund", "userReview": "[What made it even more significant was that the novel was published in 1988, when the Berlin Wall was still up.

Diese Vergangenheit spielt zwar unterschwellig immer wieder eine Rolle, wichtiger aber ist der beschriebene Prozess des \u00c4lterwerdens, die Ehen der beiden mit den ebenso zentralen Frauen, die Beziehungen zu den Kindern, der historische Kontext, der das Bild von Hausfrauentum und Sexualit\u00e4t pr\u00e4gt, ebenso ein gewisses Standesbewusstsein.

The writing itself is fine...at times very beautiful and inspiring, but on the whole there is too much repetition of thecharacters personalities. It is a relief to read a book of Brookner'sthat isn't just about a sad woman, disappointed in love. The focus here is on two close men friends of very different temperaments...who become business partners...and about their families."}, {"userName": "Patricia", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9113276-patricia", "userReview": "This is a deep dive character development and slow moving examination of the lives of Thomas Hartmann and Thomas Fibich two German boys sent to England during WWII. The novel examines their adult lives, marriages to Yvette Hartmann and Christine Hardy Fibich, and their young adult children Marianne Hartmann and Toto Fibich. If you want a novel with \"action\" this isn't happening in this book. Instead this is a well done examination of the lives of six very closed introverted individuals."}, {"userName": "Jean Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2958428-jean-kelly", "userReview": "The same terrific effort but I think this is the first Brookner novel I have read where the men, women and male and female children are developed and worked with.

It's a gentle, insinuating sort of novel. You come to care about the main characters very much, even though not a lot happens to them.
