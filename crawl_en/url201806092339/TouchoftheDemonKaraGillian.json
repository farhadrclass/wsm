This is an amaze-balls followup to the last 4 books. The last 4 were really good urban fantasy with procedural stuff, but this book throws that formula into demon-town and is even more interesting for it. I was awestruck at the twists and turns and the, \"Oh MAN why didn't I see that before!\" So...yeah. If you like the series you gotta read this, and if you haven't read the series start in, because this series is top-notch in the genre.

This installment shifts from urban fantasy to high fantasy. I wouldn\u2019t mind that if it was well done. Instead this book meandered all over the place, abolished previously established rules and introduced a slew of new characters. The first half of the book consists of descriptions, and little else, in the mass world building. I was so bored reading about the way all the different demons look, talk etc. Also about the castles and flowers and birds and walls and mountains and seas\u2026 And don\u2019t get me started on the sigils, rituals and potencies which were delved into at great detail. The descriptions just went on and on; pages and pages of zero dialogue, nothing at all happening. Which brings me to my issues with pacing. What little plot there was, it was stilted and unbalanced. Parts of this book were honestly tedious to read. The character assassination was somewhat expected, but said character is made into over-the-top deranged lunatic. On the other hand the NEW LORD ends up coming across as a perfect knight who says and does all that is perfect (in the second half anyways). Meh\u2026boring. I was told he\u2019s mysterious and scary and broody, but I was not shown anything to make me believe it, or get on his band wagon. Him not having a frank conversation with Kara after he summoned her was an obvious plot device. It made little sense, even after he explained his inane reasons. He was a poor carbon copy of any hero in a paranormal romance book. This series already had one very boring male lead \u2013 Ryan. Do we need another one? Finally, my biggest problem - Kara. What happened to this woman? She was such an original heroine in the first couple of books. Mature, real, logical and analytical what you\u2019d think a detective would be. Now she is an impulsive and very crude 16 yr old trapped in a grown woman\u2019s body (and every male wants her). She is all powerful, yet needy and most of the time helpless. I would say she has morphed into a hybrid of a typical UF heroine. Gone is all that made her different. In general, this book was not fun to read, I don\u2019t care what happens next, everything is pretty predictable. In short, I\u2019m done with this series, a real shame for me, since it was one of my favourites."}, {"userName": "Ami", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/134600-ami", "userReview": "1.5 starsEven now, hours after I read it, and I already slept on it, I still felt VERY BITTER about this book. So forgive me, because this is not going to be a proper review. This is going to be A RANT. Plain and simple. It is also VERY SPOILERY. You've been warned.----Three words: Frustrated. Disappointed. Pissed-off.HATED IT. HATED IT. HATED IT.Those are the feelings I have for this book. I have never been this pissed off and annoyed with a PNF/UF series before. Even the ones I gave up (because I can't remember giving any of those books below 2-stars). BUT, it must be done. I can't even force myself clicking the 2-stars (my standard rating for books I dislike). Oh, book, how I hate thee? Let me count the ways:+ The combination of well-grounded police procedural and urban fantasy that I love from previous 4 books? GONE. Instead, this book is switched into high fantasy in the demon realm. Do I care about the castles, the courtyards, the sigils, the grove, etc, etc. NO! Do I care about all those demons with hard-to-pronounce names? NO! Do I care about the ryeza, the syraza, the faas, or whatever bloody level of demons they are?! FRICKING NO! I love Kara when she is among his team: Jill, Ryan, Zack, Cory... and they are nowhere to be seen, except for what, the last one chapter?!+ Kara, the level-headed female detective from the previous 4 books? GONE. So yeah, I know that Kara has the seed of being horny woman (she did have sex immediately with Rhyzkahl the first time she summoned him)... but OMG, here, instead of using her head to be in the game (you have been KIDNAPPED, WOMAN!) she uses her vagina to make her decisions. Seriously, Kara, SERIOUSLY? So Mzatal tortures her, she runs away to Rhyzkahl and have sex with him (Yep, that is what Kara is thinking, and I quote \"I wanted to have sex not watch lords, Chapter 13\"), then Rhyzkahl betrays her, and she goes back to Mzatal. Let's have fight because Rhyzkahl is evil. OOOh, we win!! Oh, Mzatal, you look handsome. So let's do celebration with sex. YAY! WTF!! + The slow friendship with Ryan and the possibility with that kiss in the last book? GONE. Ryan is just an after-thought here. Kara thinks, \"Oh Ryan kissed me and I kissed him, he said he loved me, what did I feel about him?\" ... but then OOPS, there goes that handsome demon lord. I better have sex with him, because hey, that's the only way I can get laid in this demon realm, isn't it?? F*CKERY!+ Not impressed with all the past-life-what-evers-sequence of it about Elinor too. Don't bloody care.And considering the ending here I can say that I am done with this series. DONE. Because yeah, after being kidnapped and tortured, Kara thinks it's a FANTASTIC idea to return to demon realm, to experience TRAINING for 6 months and to resign from the police force. Bye bye Ryan, Zack, Jill, Tessa, I'm off to another SEX sessions with the demon lords!!Sorry, I can't take another 5 books planned for this kind of wtf-ery. I regret that I didn't 'read' this fast enough so I can return the Kindle content back to Amazon (within 7 days) and demand a refund.Adios, Kara Gillian!! It's been a nice beginning, wonderful middle-part, and such cr*ppy ending of our relationship.PS: The only reason I can still give an extra 0.5 stars? Some of the secondary characters are still fun to read. Like Idris, the human summoner, and of course Kehlirik the popcorn-loving demon from book #2 makes an appearance. But since they're \"secondary\" and the whole issue I have is with the main character, they cannot save the book."}, {"userName": "Christina", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5379483-christina", "userReview": "I'm conflicted about this one. While I did really enjoy finally getting answers to all the questions from the previous books & learning more about the demon realm & all the arcane mechanics I REALLY missed the cop/investigation/case procedural element from previous installments. Also it felt like there was WAY TOO MUCH downtime & all the characters I had grown attached to barely make a cameo appearance. All that did allow me to relate more to Kara's state of mind because as the reader I was missing her home, friends, family & life just as much as she was but that also left me just missing everything I like about this series & I found myself losing interest. I found that I had to force myself to get through the book when I normally would have torn through it. So I guess it breaks down to I'm happy to have gotten answers but sad that it was at the cost of all the things I love about the series & now I'm dreading the direction the series is going but I hope I'm wrong."}, {"userName": "Heather the Queen of (Smut)Books", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3999421-heather-the-queen-of-smut-books", "userReview": "Edit...Update:You mean I stalked one of my favorite author's Facebook page, website and twitter for THIS?

Give me more!We're leaving Earth for a brand new sidewise world! Heck yeah!The best part is when Kara learns that her paramour can't be trusted. Big surprise? Maybe not.

Kara finds herself betrayed, imprisoned, and used as a pawn in struggles that began long before she was born. For those of you that love angst, pain and torture; you will get your fill, for those (like me) who want revenge, uh, justice, you will get that in ways you never expected (I mean it, you NEVER expected). Let us not forget the bit of passion and near erotic nature of previous novels, yep, that is here also, what\u2019s not to love? You should be forewarned that this book is going to be more of an independent novel in comparison to the previous books and I suppose it was needed to keep the series from becoming stale. The changes here will breathe fresh air into an already exceptional series for several more novels. The myriad plots and subplots that Ms Rowland throws out throughout the book keep you guessing and also provide enough action for her to do some new world building and fill in some history of this new world without boring the reader. Additionally, revelations concerning instances of Kara\u2019s own recent history previously hidden will be revealed, almost NOTHING is as it seemed. RATING:This is a well crafted novel that serves the purpose of soothing readers that were less than happy about the ending of Sins of the Demon (book #4) and taking the series off in new directions while holding the same level of excellent writing exhibited in previous novels. Fans of this series are going to love this, there may be some stress and concern in the early and middle portions of the book but you will cheer the ending \u2026\u2026 trust me :) 5 Stars easy and more great novels in this series still to come!Series reading order at this link:http://www.dianarowland.com/index.htmlView all my reviews"}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7017312-michelle", "userReview": "I have been a HUGE fan of this series from the start! I hated the ending of the last book because it left the reader hanging and waiting for more. Maybe the anticipation had me expecting to be blown away and thoroughly in love with book five. I'm very saddened to report that I wasn't!This book began with me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happened next. And while there were a few 'oh my God!' moments for me there were also a lot of 'Oh heck NO!' moments! As a dedicated fan I am invested in these characters and so when a betrayal takes place as the reader who feels invested I too feel betrayed. Not only betrayed by the character but by the author as well!I felt the author took it way too far. I'm not reading horror and I don't need to read such vile things to be entertained. I'm looking for a little less gruesome and just something different that takes me out of my world and sets my imagination souring.What I feel I got in this installment was negative in every way. I don't recall a single feel good moment. Even when Kara triumphed she did with little umph for me because it meant another character I'd invested in did not triumph. And then we have my perception of Kara. I felt she changed from a woman who invested in relationships to one that simply slept around (or would with a little prodding anyway) with every man that looked at her! And really - what is up with all of a sudden EVERY male having the hots for Kara? Is it just me or were others scratching their heads over that one? I thought this woman wasn't a looker? I know her personality isn't the drawing factor! And was I the only one that did NOT see Idris had the hots for her too? All of a sudden it was Kara talking to Mzatal about it.. what? And then where did the Mzatal feelings come from? One minute it's friends the next it's naked?And for me personally I have to say I still don't feel that there has been any time or effort put into her relationship with any of the male characters other than Rhyzkahl. I haven't any idea who Ryan (aka Szerain) really is and I never felt the buildup to warrant the \u2018I love you\u2019 at that end of the last book. Even so, the author felt it necessary to introduce yet another man with the SAME ISSUE!!!! It's as if Diana has no clue how to build relationships in her books! I'm not sure why it wasn't as big of an issue before but now it's just glaringly obvious and I find it very off putting!I feel as if there are all these new characters and they all just fall flat! I know what they look like physically but that\u2019s about it.Bottom line is - we need more ANSWERS and far LESS loopholes!Am I the only one that was left scratching my head thinking what the hell? And if I had to guess I\u2019d say the next book plot is going to be (at least in part) about getting Idris back? And possibly his lineage? Yet Idris is another character we haven't invested in and know nothing about? Yeah, can\u2019t WAIT to read THAT one!I'm at a cross roads: I LOVED LOVED this series before this book but I'm not sure I even WANT to read book six. I'm going to put that decision on the back burner and wait until the description of the next book comes out. Who knows?Overall \u2013 my opinion is this may be one to skip! Just because you didn't see something coming and the author manages to shock you - does NOT mean it's a good thing! This author took a great risk - like standing too close to the edge of a cliff -in her effort to produce shock value. Well she did it! Unfortunately it went all downhill from there! Sorry Diana - this was a free fall!My opinion - the other books were 5 stars for entertainment but this one I could have done without!"}, {"userName": "Erin Tanner", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5238024-erin-tanner", "userReview": "I will probably be the only person that gives this book a 1 star review but I have my reasons. To start, the first 100 pages were like a complete waste of time. NOthing really happened! It was maddening to me. So many times I started to put the book down. When Kara finally escaped to Rhyzkahl was when things got interesting. Rhyzkahl is mysterious, enigmatic, mysterious and nefarious. He has all the qualities to be a great anti-hero. Now after having readers get invested in the relationship between Rhyzkahl and Kara through four books she decides out of the blue to make him a sadistic bad guy. I did not like this at all. It almost felt to me as if she knew that she should be wrapping up this series but to keep it going she had to come up with some kind of twist. Yes, I realize Rhyzkahl is a demon and all of them are untrustworthy and have hidden agendas but the way that he has been with Kara in previous books as well as the beginning of this book made me feel this was way out of character for him. And then her reasoning for Rhyzkahl to go to such extremes was to make Kara a thrall and use her to retrieve Szrain's blade. Couldn't he have gotten her to do that without carving her up? I think so. Secondly, if he was just using her then why was he acting so damn jealous and possessive when anyone touched her, especially Mzatal? I believe that Rhyzkahl does have some real feelings for Kara. Speaking of Kara, she really got on my nerves in this book. She acted so clueless and so damn helpless while still talking smack.I wanted to tell her to shut up. This brings me to Mzatal. I don't like him and I am not buying that he and Kara are into each other all of a sudden. Their romance feels as forced to me as the one between Kara and Ryan. Kara belongs with Rhyzkahl. Mzatal and Ryan do nothing for me. I also didn't like this book because I felt the author went too in depth with descriptions of the demons and the arcane stuff. It bored me. The whole Elinor/Kara essence connection was okay but I felt it would have been better if Kara was her descendant and that was why all of the lords wanted her. Not only for having a potential for great power but also because they'd loved her ancestress.The reason I have read the series for so long is because I became emotionally connected to the relationship between Kara and Rhyzkahl. Now that his character has been completely assasinated, this will probably be the last Kara Gillian book for me."}, {"userName": "Bonnie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5136858-bonnie", "userReview": "My rating: 4.5 of 5 starsA copy of Touch of the Demon was provided to me by DAW/Penguin Group (USA) for review purposes. Thank you!Diana Rowland's Kara Gillian series has been a favorite of mine from the very beginning, but with 'Touch of the Demon' she's truly taken this series to a whole new level and as Kara is so fond of saying, \"Shit just got real.\" \u2018Touch of the Demon\u2019 truly mixed things up and allowed this series to remain outstanding for many more installments.Touch of the Demon picks up right where the last one left off with that dreaded cliffhanger that I think had us all pulling our hair out. Kara finds herself in the demon realm and she's being held against her will by the demonic Lord Mzatal. Unclear as to why he's keeping her but positive that it's not for anything good she finally manages to escape and get to Rhyzkahl but she finds herself in any even worse situation. It\u2019s a complex story that has Kara spinning in confusion trying to figure out how to get out of this situation and finally get home, to Earth.The best part of this story was the imagery Diana created. Her depictions of the demon realm were meticulous allowing you to visualize it completely. From details of the palaces she stayed in to the trees to the various different demons that she had never encountered before. Each additional detail really added something distinctive to making this story highly creative. There are so much more that could be said but there were so many intricate aspects to this story-line that each detail is essentially a part of the spoiler\u2026 and I would hate to ruin this for anyone. If you\u2019ve been a fan of this series though, you will definitely love this one.Touch of the Demon is hands down the darkest, grittiest installment yet, and it was absolutely fantastic. The cliffhanger lacking ending was music to my ears and still managed to set in motion potentially awesome storylines.

I have different reactions myself: sometime I gobble it down without breathing and sometimes I look at it in wonder and can't even open it. Sin of the Demon had ended with such a high peak (and a cliff-hanger) that I was leery of reading this one. I pre-ordered it, got it on kindle for New Year, re-ordered the paperback (I love this series) and then went to wait. (Don't ask, I don't know why I do act this way.)As I noted with Naysa a few days ago in a comment, every one is gleefully useless in their happiness over a book, but every one else hates it for a different reason. So I tend to agree on this book rating, but for my own reasons. I did not mind the game-changing, I did not mind the switch to fantasy, I did not mind losing the procedural for a book. But God I did mind all the rest.Pace: the book was pretty intense for the first half, then as soon as she went back to Mazral, boom, it went downhill and stopped. Half a book of almost nothing was a bit too much. There are plenty of books made this way and I do not mind when the plot is good (it was good). But stopping it midway is like having a car wreck while speeding. The damage is bigger. Characters. Ok I get that the demon lord R had to go. But having him going mental was really over the top. He could simply be the demon Lord with his own agenda ready to screw her over. Nope he had to be lunatic all of a sudden.What happened to Kara? Where's the logical cop? The strong minded heroine? I loved her snark, yes, but here she was only that, Miss Snarky. I get that she is powerless and scared. I understand she's masking her fear. And yet...And yet she has been betrayed, tortured, betrayed again. And nothing happens to the character. Trust is such a delicate flower. Once shattered, it takes years to have it grow back. Here, it snaps back as one of the demons in the story...There was no place in this book for sex. Sex is trust and you do not have sex (after a near death experience) with a guy that has betrayed you exactly like the one who tortured you in the beginning. Or maybe you can have sex, but not the rest (friendship, kinship, again (I'm a broken record today) trust). I'm kind of flabbergasted.

She betrays Ryan with the new lord in her life and just generally behaves like she has a magical vagina. The girl needs to keep her legs closed. That said, Kara is naive and needy during the entire novel. She runs To the wrong lord, gets tortured..by someone she shouldn't trust in first place..and then runs back to The Lord she ran from and trusts him completely instead?? What the hell? Strong and independent Kara now makes me want to slap her and tell her to stop being so weak. Ugh. The elements I liked were missing - down to earth urban fantasy, the strong female main character, and the cop work. Even the relationship between Ryan and Kara is fizzling. The actual story is going to fantasy component of the urban fantasy and Kara not only has a magical vagina she must share with everyone but she's also special enough to have grove affinity that gives her lord like powers, control over a lord's blade and thanks to the magical vagina some weird connection to a lord she shouldn't have boned in the first place. I'm very disappointed in this book, and Alittle sad I pre-ordered it. I was expecting the old Demon series - not fantasy.

No! - What the FUCK! - Holy crap! How many demons, reyzas, faas, and everything else under the demon sun are we supposed to keep track of?

You can't fool me. Everyone knows you're going to screw Mzatal if not once, a hundred times while you're with him. - I was so excited after reading the last book in the series. What a cliff-hangar. I couldn't stop thinking about it. But what the hell? To wait all this time for the new book only for Kara to stay stuck in demon hell for pretty much the entire book? - I'd like an explanation as to why she's getting power from the grove. - What the hell does Elinor have to do with Kara? I don't understand the connection. - Kara, your gut-feelings suck. Pay attention! Get a clue! - You quit your job?! What the hell? How do plan on making money?- Will I be reading the next book? Yeah, most likely. I just hope it's better than this one. - Shit! Now I'm wondering why I gave it three stars. Okay, I'll be generous and give it 2-1/2 stars. You know, I should do all my reviews like this. Maybe I'm onto something."}, {"userName": "All Things Urban Fantasy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2732683-all-things-urban-fantasy", "userReview": "With such an thrilling beginning, it will be no surprise to find that the first half of TOUCH OF THE DEMON is a complete game changer for Kara Gillian. Swept away into the demon world, at the mercy of beings whose motives and manipulations she can barely comprehend, Kara is operating outside of everything known and comfortable.This degree of change was disorienting to read, but I\u2019m glad I stuck through the initial deluge of demon names, magical techniques, and political machinations. TOUCH OF THE DEMON is a pivot point for this series, opening up a long term plot line that builds off of hints from past books. The first half of the book felt a little slow for me, especially as I anticipated the twist at the story\u2019s halfway point, but that made it no less satisfying when the story changed direction. Some of the magic still seems vague (and I still can\u2019t tell a syraza from a savik from a reyza, demon-wise) but Kara\u2019s friendships, relationships, and personal growth more than carry the story for me.Though a slow start kept me from giving 5 bats, this book is both strong Urban Fantasy and a killer mid-series offering. It\u2019s hard to believe that any book could create as much anticipation as the climactic end of SINS OF THE DEMON, but TOUCH OF THE DEMON opens up a whole new world, mythology, and love life for Kara, leaving me dying for book six.Sexual Content: Sex scenes."}, {"userName": "Naoms", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2152441-naoms", "userReview": "It's as if Diana Rowland has never heard of balance. Lol! The first books in the series were way cop procedural heavy and just when I was like of the series doesn't get more fantasy driven I'm out, she gives me this book which is 100% fantasy! It's as if the author couldn't figure out how to pull a kate Daniels and give us an investigation with lots of magic intertwined. I'm interested to see where this series goes. But, this book lived up to the artsy covers that this series has. Though, Kara's relationship to men makes no sense to me. I'm not slut shaming but it's weed that she had the big I love you moment with one guy at the climatic ending of book 3, but then sleeps with two separate guys in book 4. Is she in love with the guy or not? She doesn't even have a moment where she considers not sleeping with the guys when there is a man back home worried shitless and grieving for her... Just strange."}, {"userName": "Gina", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2537465-gina", "userReview": "oh my god. I read all four books in three days and I am currently at the point of withdrawal. To put it less subtly, WANT MOAR.*edit 9/13*Okay, it took me a very long time to read this book, despite my love of the previous books in the series. Every review talked of the genre shifting to high fantasy, said they missed the policewoman aspect, that this book wasn't as good without Kara being on Earth. I. TOTALLY. DISAGREE. Now, I'll admit that recently I have been reading more fantasy, but I don't believe that coloured my perception. I actually thought all the demons popping up on Earth was silly. But, going to the Demon realm, it's far less hellish than one would imagine. It's downright beautiful. The Demon LORDS however, are far more treacherous than I wanted to believe. I rooted for Rhyzkahl in 1-4 and he just had to go and fuck it all up. And that Mzatal guy (I may have spelt his name wrong...

Is it good? Yes. Let me say that first. It is a good book. In fact, it reached me emotionally more than the ones that came before it. It is full of twists and turns and feelings and betrayal. I was on the edge of my seat and had my heart in my throat more than once. Diana Rowland is a gifted author.But. The main character has been plucked from the world and circumstances she has inhabited for the first four books. She is dropped into an entirely different dimension and it changes everything. I felt like I was reading an entirely different series. What was once a police procedural with a paranormal element is now \u2026 Well, I don\u2019t what it is anymore. Pure fantasy? Maybe? It\u2019s entirely set in the demon world. No crime, no police, no urban half of the urban fantasy.Not only is the setting different but so is the cast of characters. Yes, Rhyzkahl is there, but the nature of his relationship with Kara alters so drastically that he is almost unrecognizable. Ryan is on an entirely different plane, which is frustrating, coming off the big I love you reveal at the end of the last book. And then, to shake things up even more, is the introduction of the demon lord Mzatal. Just when it seemed like there was one too many love interests in Kara\u2019s life, now there\u2019s yet another.Side note. I am not one for slut shaming. I love sexually empowered female heroines, but I have real trouble with the idea of Kara being in love with one man while having sex with others. I would have the same issue if she were a guy. It is the romance reader in me. Kara, herself, struggles with the issue and I appreciate that it\u2019s not ignored. But I don\u2019t like taking such a scenic route to the romantic HEA. It makes it hard for me to believe in a love when it can be set aside for some good horizontal action.Anyway, with all of those issues aside, it was a captivating read. Rowland really puts Kara through the wringer and the things she sees and learns shake her very foundation. She has to endure a lot, which makes for some difficult reading at times, but it also made me emotionally invest in the character even more. Other than her extremely questionable romantic choices, Kara is quite an exceptional character. She is tough and she learns quickly. She respects the beings around her and\u2026 I just like her.There are a ton of new characters and new species of demons introduced. I struggled at times to keep up with them all. But many, like Mzatal and Idris, are obviously big players in the future of these books.I have no idea what the rest of the series will look like. I am mourning a little of what was lost, despite the fact that enjoyed the book, because I feel like we\u2019re never going to be able to go back. I liked this book, but I liked what the series was before too. I guess I need to wait and see what happens next."}, {"userName": "Suzanne the Bookaholic and Proud", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7627379-suzanne-the-bookaholic-and-proud", "userReview": "I know this review is a little late, but wanted to start number 6, wish I hadn't nowthe Kara Gillian book we're amazing to start, you got a lot of insight onto different demons and their realm and the heirachy in which they are placed, from biggest to littlest, strongest to weakest, I really liked how she was juggling being a cop to being a summoner and the highs and lows of many people, from having stress and no money, (we can all relate to that), but when starting book 5, I was also a little disappointed, the story just started to get weird, Kara was summoned to the demon realm, where she found out her sexy demon lord, didn't want her for her, but what she can do for him, (we all missed it at the start lol), but then it just went downhill for me, the one she thought was the bad guy turned out to be the good guy and vice versa, (a bit cliche to me), I genuinely thought it was a series that would last the full hog, but no it was sadly not to be, it's just sad that a good series to start just doesn't last. hope to find the next series does last"}, {"userName": "Kristin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3600796-kristin", "userReview": "[Then they fucked each other!!!! What the supermotherfuckingfuck?????!!!!! I was really happy that there was finally a relationship that was just based on respect and friendship, even though she admitted he was hot, but then it took a very sudden, out-of-the-blue turn that was so fucking cheesy I\u2019m surprised my eyes didn\u2019t hurt, I was rolling them so damn much. The sex scenes with Rhyzkahl have always been pretty hot, but the one with Mzatal was just\u2026there. And the only real reason for it seemed to be so that their essences or whatever would be changed and more in tune with each other or some such crap, because Kara even thought to herself it\u2019s not love and if it never happens again, that\u2019s fine, though she thought it was super hot (and bonus, unlike Rhyzkahl, he actually stayed with her all night *swoon* *barf*). So what I want to know is, is this going to turn into one of those series where Kara has to fuck her way through the demonic lords to gain power, \u2018cause if it is, please tell me now so I can call it quits. Actually, if it is, I\u2019m still out but just point me to the sections where she attempts to seduce the two gay lords, because that might be pretty amusing. If Kara thought Ryan was pissed about her banging Rhyzkahl, just wait until he finds out she not only fucked him after professing her love for Ryan, but also that she banged yet another demonic lord!

I was really anxious before starting this novel \u2026 Indeed, there are widely different reviews regardless wherever the place where we read them and it is true that between a friend who was completely disappointed and one who completely loved it, I was not sure where my heart was going to swing. It remained for me to read it to know my verdict. And finally I was very surprised by this novel, and in the right way. It\u2019s true, I also understand why some have a little more trouble. This book is very different from the others which we have been accustomed to, and I felt that the series took a big turning point in its history this time. But I must say it has completely convinced me for my part. I dare say that this volume is my favorite of the series. All I wanted to know since the first book was revealed in part. Of course there are a lot of events whose we remain totally shocked about. I had to reread certain passages to try to understand what was going on, to try to understand the reactions of certain characters or to see how the situation could change in such a short time. I think we can only be completely surprised by this novel, whether by what is going on or by this new plot that we follow.Since the end of Volume 4, I could not wait to see what would happen in the demons realm. Who would not? We knew nothing of this place and I really wanted to learn and understand how it was governed. I must say that the explanations and information has exceeded my expectation. We learn so many things here, either about the characters, the world or the past of each person. Kara is in the hands of a Lord who makes her do many things. But despite appearances, the Lord does everything he can to protect his world and hers, and Kara is a threat. At first I was quite disturbed to see that she was not rebelling more compared to what she was going through, it was pretty strange to see her that way, but we understand very well that whatever she might do, nothing will change her state. However she does not remain there doing nothing, and she is waiting patiently for her moment to act and break free of her \u00ab chains \u00bb. She discovers that she has an affinity with this world she thought she did not know about and a mysterious past is revealed to her gradually throughout the novel. As I also said at the beginning, there are some quite unimaginable events and it\u2019s pretty hard to understand all the actions. Kara is actually quite naive and trusts others rather easily, something that will put her in big trouble. There is an event that particularly shocked me, and we wonder throughout the book what happened, why everything turned this way and what really were the reasons. Our heroine has a pretty amazing effect on each of Lords and we wonder what will happen on the end and what skills she will develop.There is perhaps one thing that bothered me a bit in the novel. When I started the series, Kara showed enough \u00ab suspicion \u00bb in relation to people with whom she had a relationship. Or at least it made \u200b\u200bher think a lot and I feel that she had forget about all that without a reason. And she does not need much. It\u2019s not a lot but it\u2019s true that I\u2019m curious to see what Diana Rowland reserves us later to see what happens then. It was therefore a very good volume and a real surprise."}, {"userName": "Melindeeloo", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2766907-melindeeloo", "userReview": "Ok, so last we saw demon summoning homicide detective Kara Gillian, she was hanging from a cliff (figuratively) and this book picks up the instant after that ending.I liked Touch of the Demon (Kara Gillian), it finally answered some questions that have started to pop up in the last few books while opening new doors for Kara, but... I missed the police procedural/arcane murder mystery in the background. Touch of the Demon was more 'fantasyish' with most of the story set in the Demon Realm and some really awful things happen to Kara which put cracks in her normally snarky demeanor.Even though I liked the story which was meandering at times - since there was fair amount of descriptions of the different environs in the world and with interactions between Kara and the supporting cast - I did get to one point in the story just before the big finish where I had no problem putting the book down. Actually, not quite a nit but more of a comment, Kara continues to be a 'love the one your with kind of girl' which feels sort of odd to my inner romance reader - but this is sexy UF, so I guess the steamy times with no intention of looking for a HEA is par for the course for Kara.Touch of the Demon opens up new horizons for the series and some big things that happen to shift Kara's view of some of the stories players and some exciting things near the end meant that, despite the not quite nit and the lulls, book was still entertaining and I am looking forward to the next one but glad that there wasn't another cliffhanger ending here - since this time I am going to have to actually wait for the next book."}, {"userName": "Katie(babs)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/179852-katie-babs", "userReview": "Since this is a series, you can't just pick up Touch of the Demon and start reading.

The last book, Sins of the Demon, was such a cliffhanger, I was ready to explode because she had to know what was going to happen to Kara, the Louisiana police detective and demon summoner who was forced into the demon realm and now stuck there. What happens to Kara in Touch of the Demon will blow your mind away. As I read, my jaw was on the floor the entire time. The cast of characters introduced and the world, mysticism and terms created are very inventive. I don't know how Diana did it all.There are so many twists and turns and OMG moments, specifically with Kara and her demon lord lover, Rhyzkhal. What happens between these two will stun readers. You won't expect anything. Also hot demon sex makes up for the last book. Lots of demon sex and total shocks galore. Some loose ends are tied up, mainly with FBI agent Ryan.
