When Angel was still a baby, her father, Cal left and never came back. Curiously, Naomi is her paternal grandmother. Ruth and Naomi basically just tolerate each other and they all are living in Naomi's house. Angel is convinced that Ruth and Naomi have been keeping secrets from her but can't get anyone to talk. One summer night, Cal phones and tells Naomi, who answered the phone, that he will be coming home for Thanksgiving. Angel immediately sees that Ruth is not at all pleased by this development even though her parents are still legally married. Angel determines that she will find out the secrets that everyone has been hiding from her. This basically is a coming of age novel, and as a 62 year old, this type of novel usually doesn't appeal to me all that much. However, I must say that I actually liked this novel quite a lot. The character development of Angel, Ruth, and Naomi as well as of several more minor characters was excellent. Angel's best friend, Sophie, is a rather self-absorbed, beautiful girl whose mother is dying of cancer. Old Susan is a Native American rumored to be a witch. Angel runs into her one day after an unsettling experience and they become good friends. Patsy is Cal's half-sisterwho is hospitalized for a mental illness but whom Angel suspect of holding the key to the secrets she is attempting to unravel. Dottie, the town's doctor's wife, may be wealthier than most in the town but has a heart of gold and really comes through when anyone needs her. Naomi is a very strict Christian who fervently believes in corporal punishment and who sees the devil in both Ruth and Angel. Jenkins, the hellfire and brimstone preacher, has his own secrets to protect. There is a lot of small town southern flavor, the goodness and also the dark side of this circa the seventies. Kingsley makes all of the characters, even the rather unsympathetic Naomi, seem like good people despite or perhaps even because of their foibles. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a story about love and forgiveness."}, {"userName": "Bev", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1923948-bev", "userReview": "I liked the book and am really glad I won it. It keep my interest and the characters were interesting and believable. I thought I knew how the book was going to play out at about page 117 however it did not quite turn out the way I imagined. This kept my interest to the end. The interactions between family members, and the secrets they keep from Angel leads to some angst for a girl coming into her teens...but as she learns, even her friend families have trials and twists and no family lives up to the \"perfect\" ideal. I liked the interactions of Angel and her friends, and the undercurrent of \"Daddy's\" return and the positives and possible negatives of life changes....made for interesting reading."}, {"userName": "Kimber", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1414012-kimber", "userReview": "I devoured this book in one setting and am now anxiously awaiting this author's next work. Set in the early 1970s in rural East Tennessee the story is told in the voice of 13 year old Angel, who is convinced that not only is she bound for hell because her precociousness goes against the grain of her Bible-thumping grandmother, but also that she is responsible for her father leaving when she was a baby. In turns funny, heart wrenching and witty, Kingsley pulls you into Angel's world and doesn't let you go until the very end, where she still leaves you wanting more, even though the ending is very well resolved.Mary E.

Since it was told from the perspective of a teenager, I was a little bit concerned that I would dislike it as much as \"Catcher in the Rye\", but fortunately, Angel is much smarter and not annoying like Holden Caufield!

Obviously, I found the premise of the book to be very interesting. If I hadn't I would never have downloaded it to my Kindle. With that being said, I find myself struggling to know what to say.Against my better judgment I finished this book. I hate not finishing stories, even when I don't find them compelling. I find myself hoping that they will improve or teach me something valuable. Because I finished it, I will give it two stars instead of one.Never engaging and very predictable, I found myself wanting so much more. I wanted to become immersed in the storyline. I wanted to find myself connecting on a personal level with each character. I wanted to have the desire to keep reading into the wee hours of the morning just to see what was coming and what had happened in the past. Unfortunately, none of those things ever really came to fruition for me.In addition, there were elements that I absolutely hated. Though not overly graphic, the story includes a near assault by friends, crass references to anatomy and sexuality, descriptions from an illustrated book about sex, a hypocritical-homosexual Baptist minister, a mistreated victim and a child molester.I am under no delusions that everyone lives happy, perfect lives. I understand, more than most , that bad things happen. I have read books that cover such heavy subjects and I have been moved deeply. However, I don't feel the writing did justice to the circumstances. For example, Angel remains friends with the two young men that nearly assaulted her--even inviting them (and their families) to a party in her home. In reality, that would never happen!The resolution found in the final 5 paragraphs, as it should be, was the best part of this book. I only wish I had enjoyed the story as much as the conclusion."}, {"userName": "Gabby", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7290629-gabby", "userReview": "For a not so long book, it was a slow read. The author keeps you interested in the main character Angel and her journey to figuring out why her father has been gone all these years. There are many other interesting characters that are introduced throughout the book, though it sometimes gets confusing on who they are. The ending I did not see coming, and I was slightly confused and had to read it again. But it leaves the reader feeling satisfied when Angel finally gets the answers she has been looking for.

It brings me back to younger days of Cheerwine, transistor radios, and first kisses. My teenage years were spent in East Tennessee (the setting for the story) so it enabled me to sink into sweet reminiscence as I turned each page. The narration, told in first person from Angel\u2019s point of view, is fresh and engaging. She is witty and honest and a believable character. Actually, all the characters are credible\u2014with redeeming qualities as well as evident shortcomings.Orange-haired Angel Bishop (she is quite literal and doesn\u2019t like being referred to as red-haired) is an energetic thirteen-year-old with many unanswered questions concerning her family. Is it her fault Daddy ran off when she was just a baby? Why is Aunt Patsy locked up in a crazy house? Why does Mama and her grandmother, Naomi, barely tolerate each other? Why won\u2019t anybody tell her the truth?When out of the blue, her daddy, Cal, calls and says he is coming home, she wonders if it's a good thing. Isn't this what she'd always prayed for? More questions surface and Angel sets out on a quest to find the answers. She searches for clues from the town recluse, Old Susan, and her beloved Aunt Patsy.I recommend this book. It is a quick and easy read (though some topics may make some readers a little uneasy) that drew me in from the first page. The dealings between Angel and her friend, Sophie, and her first boy-crush, Ray, are sincere, sometimes frustrating and always realistic. But my favorite relationship is that between Angel and Aunt Patsy. Her eccentric aunt adds a lot of humor, soul and purpose to this story. I enjoyed Mary E. Kingsley's ANGEL. It is a memorable book with a powerful message and lasting effect."}, {"userName": "Cindy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7549226-cindy", "userReview": "\u201c...he\u2019s held my heart in his hands for all of my thirteen years.

Angel was no exception.I was in love with this book up until the end. Everything else was perfect but the ending seemed to fall flat.This was Mary E.

Her father left for places unknown and for reasons not explained when she was about 1 year old. Naomi is a radical Christian, constantly quoting scripture to Angel to show her the error of her ways. Mama seems to be afraid of Naomi and does what she is told. Angel only wants her dream of a daddy's return and a home of their own. Then one day an unexpected call comes from her daddy saying he is coming home for Thanksgiving. Now Angel must deal with her nerves at meeting him and the secrets surrounding his disappearance. In this stuggle, she finds that there are more than just that secret hiding in this small village of hers.

Things start unraveling and coming to light when he calls out of the blue and announces he is coming home. Suddenly everyone is acting a little strange and Angel sets out to find out why. While the book description focuses on the father part of Angel's story I felt like the book was much more about her coming of age than anything else. Her father's part in her story was actually a small piece as far as I could see. Yes, the whole book centers around Angel trying to find out information on her Dad but what happens while she is doing that is where I think the real story happens. Kingsley's first book was well-written, moved along at a decent pace, and had enough character development. I have no real complaints about it.

This debut novel, by an author that I hope to read more from in the future, takes place in the early 1970's in Eastern Tennessee and is told through the eyes of thirteen year old Angel Bishop. Angel has questions and no one will give the answers. Angel's father, Cal, left town supposedly for work when she was a baby and has not come back since. A phone call to Angel's Mother Ruth Ellen and her Grandma Naomi from Cal changes everything. Cal is coming home. There are a lot of sub-stories in this book with some content that is sensitive and even uncomfortable. You will also find many faith references.

I think the relationship with the Aunt needed to be explored more with regards to Angel's relationship with her. Angel growing up in a household of her mother and paternal grandmother confused me at first given the secrecy of the family dynamic and how is got there but as the story unraveled things became more clear. I was more appalled at how the grandmother completely idolizes her son even though I think she knew that things were not right. The way she treats the mother and at times Angel, is believable for those \"overbearing\" mothers who think their sons walk on water (I know there are some still out there today) in this setting. I think the main theme of the book is to highlight this family dynamic/relationship and possibly help us to not so quickly dismiss others because their claims about a person don't necessarily match up with the image we see everyday."}, {"userName": "Rosemary Cantrell", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51951682-rosemary-cantrell", "userReview": "This is a young adult coming-of-age novel and is surprisingly good, especially for a first novel.

I really enjoyed the story of this journey that Angel makes. All changes when her long-lost father calls to say he will be home for Thanksgiving. No one will ever talk about him or why he left and now she will make the discoveries herself, with the help of some interesting characters who help her to see with new eyes.I would recommend this novel to youth and adult alike.
