There is precision and beauty and a twining of tales that will be meaningful to anyone who has been a mother or had a mother, adoptive or otherwise. Kate St. Vincent Vogl tells the story of coming to terms with being found by her birthmother almost immediately after the death of her mom (her adoptive mother,) and shortly after becoming a mother for the first time herself. She tells it honestly: the pain, the tension and the humor. She tells it with beauty, even the not so pretty parts. I was completely pulled in and can't wait to see what is next from this author."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2643509-mary", "userReview": "This beautifully written book is a must read for any mother considering adoption or already experiencing the miracle of adoption. The author takes the reader through an amazing true story as if the reader were with her. We get to experience how adoption affects a child, an adult, a mother, the family,etc. We also experience the struggles and triumphs."}, {"userName": "Maureen M", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/944992-maureen-m", "userReview": "An interesting life story by a writer who was adopted and then reluctantly gets to know her birth mother. As personal a story as it is, it is told in a fairly impersonal way, so that the reader doesn't really see what the writer is going through. Adoptive kids and parents will make the connection but a general reader probably won't."}, {"userName": "Linda S", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1999055-linda-s", "userReview": "I read this after hearing Kate speak at a retreat. It is a very touching story that had me laughing and crying. I'm not touched by adoption and I am not a mother but it was still struck me as a wonderful book about families and how they are formed in many ways."}, {"userName": "Jenny", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1774454-jenny", "userReview": "liking it so far - her style of writing loses me occasionally, but her perspective is so interesting."}, {"userName": "christin walth", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2493123-christin-walth", "userReview": "Loved it!

Kate accepted the fact, but it caused stress between her sister and her parents,After law school Kate married, had a daughter and her mother died of cancer. Through her obituary, Val, Kate\u2019s birth mother called her and she started a relationship. She also ended up meeting the family of her birth father who was killed in a car accident. She was accepted by this new group, to the point of introducing her father to them.I saw ranges of emotions as she went through this journey that kept me turning the pages. She questioned her own mothering skills, how she adopted family would feel, coming to terms with her father\u2019s second marriage, and a very emotional scene in a car when Val broke down with regret for letting her baby girl go.This scenario ended well, my mother\u2019s did not. She always knew she was adopted and waited until; her parents passed away to go through Catholic service (where Kate\u2019s adoption also took place). Mom was adopted in 1936, and found both of her parents. Her Dad explains our shortness and sense of humor. Her mother wanted grand \u2018children\u201d, and most of us the seven of us were adults. Agnes not accepting my mother\u2019s adult children was very hard on my mom.I will give this book to my Mom to read, and try to see if Kate would like to meet her. I am glad her story had a happy ending."}, {"userName": "Cathy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8074442-cathy", "userReview": "Meh. I know... a somewhat thoughtless rating for a compelling topic. This is a topic with which I have some personal experience, albeit indirect, so I expected to be enthralled. While the writing was strong and vivid in many ways, and certainly authentic in its presentation, it was somewhat wordy, at points. It also circled a bit unnecessarily at points... to the past, without a clear pattern of, or appreciable understanding for why the author has done so. I also do not feel as though I got to know the author's birthmother to the degree that I got to know her mother..."}, {"userName": "Jeanne", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19751864-jeanne", "userReview": "This is a true story of a woman who meets her birthmother after the death of her adoptive mother.
