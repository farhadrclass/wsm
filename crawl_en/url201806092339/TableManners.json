Here are a few flaws that totally defeated my willfull suspension of disblief:- Deidre and her arch-enemy Marla go on tv together. Marla slips on the wet floor and ends up falling down and getting covered with cake batter. Later, Marla gets her revenge by loaning Diedre a too-tight dress, which rips while Deidre is wearing it at a fancy shindig. Stoooooopid.- Deidre gets pregnant. Her gay best friend comes over for lunch one day and noticies. Yet her fabulous wonderful caring boyfriend, who presumably eats with her regularly and sees her naked on occasion, completely fails to notice anything amiss for nine weeks! But they have a fabulous relationship and he's the bestest man EVAR.- Deidre's business completely falls apart AND she gets in a car wreck. Yet she doesn't call Mr. Fabulous to let him know any of this. He's not mad or hurt when he finds out he had no clue about the major events in her life. But we're still supposed to believe they have this great relationship. Does not compute.- The final conversation of the book, which can be summarized thus:Kevin: Will you be my wife?Deidre: Yes. Will you be the father of my child?Aside from the remarkably clunky way Deidre words her question, it's completely stupid. The guy already is the father of her child, and has been for nine weeks. He just didn't know it. I get what she was trying to say, but this couldn't have been expressed more awkwardly.There were still fun parts of the book, but overall Deidre comes across as an idiot with low self-esteem. Furthermore, most of the plot complications in this book are straight out of junior high. Kevin's sister calls in his ex to try to break up the relationship? Really?? Come on."}, {"userName": "Leah ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2432818-leah", "userReview": "I was disappointed with this book - definitely not as good as the first! Deidre in \"Good Things\" was a strong, businesswoman who went after what she wanted. Deidre in this book got wishy-washy, jealous that her boyfriend was spending time with a beautiful womand and impulsive. I also did not like that she got pregnant AT ALL. What was the point of that? I felt like there were too many story lines and none of them were developed well."}, {"userName": "Staci", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/177641-staci", "userReview": "I loved her first book, Good Things, which introduced me to Deidre McIntosh and she quickly became a character that I really felt an affinity to. I was happy to hear that King decided to write a sequel to tie up the loose ends from her first book. I again, loved Deidre, but there were times when I felt the writing wasn't as tight as it should've been and that this was written as an after-thought. Don't get me wrong, it's a fun book to read. But, the plot was cliche at times and I know King can do so much better than that. I know it feels like I'm thrashing this book doesn't it???.....I'm really not trying to be negative, I enjoyed it, but I wish it would've matched the first one in the caliber of writing."}, {"userName": "Keri Daskam", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2446230-keri-daskam", "userReview": "This book was pretty much meaningless.

Deirdre has her television show up and running but her gourmet cookie line is stalled in production. Deirdre's friend William is preparing for his commitment ceremony with his live-in partner. Lindsay is recovering from illness but has lost interest in her diner Wishbone. While Kevin and Deirdre are still very much in love, the sudden appearance of Kevin's ex-fiancee Sabine causes Deirdre anxiety. Is Deirdre's happy ending starting to unravel?Review:I had loved Good Things and was so excited to read the sequel Table Manners. But just as I was about to start, I was worried that I wouldn't enjoy the sequel as much as the first book because Good Things was just so fun. I couldn't see how Mia King could add to Deirdre and Kevin's love story. I was wrong again!Mia King does just that! In Table Manners Deirdre continues to care for her many friends, bond with Kevin's family, and support Kevin with the same humor and spirit that endeared her to readers in Good Things. Meanwhile, Sabine and Marla Banks add just enough spice to the story for us to worry.If you enjoy books that incorporate food into the plot, you'll love that food is an important part of the story in Mia King's books. As in Good Things, this book includes recipes of dishes mentioned in the novel. Here are some of the recipes you'll find: Leek and Proscuitto Tart, Summer Beef Bourguignonne Skewers, Pan-Seared Rainbow Trout with Warm Summer Tomato-Olive-Caper Salad, Hunan-Style Marinated Lamb Lollipops with Nicoise Vegetable Ragout, Ricotta Cheesecake with Fresh Seasonal Fruit, Green Tea Tart with Lychees and Raspberries, Macarons Chocolat, Sparkling Pomegranate Lemonade, Lemongrass Green Tea, Lychee Martini with Crystallized Ginger.I highly recommend Table Manners to anyone looking for a fun love story. It's a great summer read! If you haven't read Good Things yet, start the love story from the beginning.

It was well written, full of mouth watering recipes (there\u2019s even a recipe section in the back) and I enjoyed the character and her adventure, however this book just didn\u2019t grab me and I thought this it was relatively average.We follow Deidre McIntosh as she\u2019s working on developing her own cookie line while navigating her boyfriend\u2019s wealthy family where she doesn\u2019t quite fit in, especially around his sister who becomes determined to see the back of her.This is chick lit with a heroine who has drive and determination and a career she loves. There are laugh out loud moments and some mouth watering descriptions of high end cookies and meals she creates. I got the impression throughout the novel that Deidre would have landed on her feet if she was unsuccessful at saving her new company, her man and/or both and I found that refreshing, while at the same time I don\u2019t think it gave me enough to latch onto. The stakes didn\u2019t seem particularly high maybe.I didn\u2019t get sucked in or emotionally involved as I would have liked to and although I had fun watching Deidre flounder to try and save all that was dear to her, I just wasn\u2019t blown away by this novel.I thought Table Manners was a solid 3 Star. I didn\u2019t hate it and would gladly read another of Mia King\u2019s novels, but I didn\u2019t adore it either, so it\u2019s smack dab in the middle. ***After updating my Goodreads review and reading the other reviews, I found out this novel is a sequel. Who Knew? Certainly not myself nor my review partner when we ordered it, nor me when I read it. Maybe that's why I felt something was missing? I just pulled out the book and it doesn't state it anywhere. How aggravating because I certainly would have read them in order had I known."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/254596-mary", "userReview": "From the moment I finished reading Good Things by Mia King I've been keeping an eye out for the sequel. I finally got my hands on a copy of Table Manners and am pleased to tell you that Ms. King gives readers a sequel that is sweet, fun and satisfying.Deidre's life, although good, has become hectic. She's helping her friends William and Alain plan their commitment ceremony; launching a new pastry line; and then travels to help another friend in dire need of her assistance in Jacob's Point (a small lakeside community and location of Kevin's vacation home). Toss into the mix Kevin's ex-fiancee and you've got a recipe for disaster.Will Deidre and Kevin's relationship survive the challenges and obstacles in their path? Well, you'll just have to find out for yourself. Table Manners could be a stand alone novel but I recommend reading Good Things first. You'll want to read about Deidre and Kevin from the very beginning. One more thing: stock your pantry because you're probably going to want to bake or cook after reading these books. There are recipes!"}, {"userName": "Jenny", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1332648-jenny", "userReview": "This was a good, mindless read. Somewhere in the first few pages, I thought to see if this was a sequel - which it is - so then I felt like I was coming into the story halfway through. (Which I hate - I'm always that person to start a series from book #1 and go through them chronologically.)At points this was ridiculous. When an author jumps between characters irregularly or too frequently, it seems amatuer, like the author doesn't have enough character development or plot to drive one character's perspective and needs to jump to others to fill in plot. (I had a similar compaint in Before You Know Kindness.)I couldn't quite figure out the point of the book. I guess it was the success of Sweet Deidre? And the \"excerpts\" from Rosemary's gossip column were stupid. Does the world REALLY care that much about this chef? Not even the Iron Chef warrants a gossip column and this woman is far less famous."}, {"userName": "Becky R.", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1836567-becky-r", "userReview": "I really have grown to love Mia King's clear writing style and voice. This style really helped me learn to love her main character, Deidre even more in book two. The one part I found surprising and satisfying was Deidre's reactions to really difficult situations or strife. In my head I could see the main character lashing out, showing what a strong woman can do, but Deidre didn't need to do that. Somehow this character continued to make choices that felt low impact, not as emotionally ridden as I would have thought the author would take them. I kept waiting for tears, yells, or quiet wallowing. Instead, Deidre methodically faced her circumstances, and I really admired that. Also, even though I felt like I sometimes knew the storyline, it still surprised me. For me, I found Mia King's second novel to be a fun, sweet success!"}, {"userName": "Connie", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie", "userReview": "Deidre McIntosh was developing a new line of cookies after starring in a successful cooking show on TV. She was also seeing Kevin Johnson, a successful wealthy bachelor. Life seemed good until she had to deal with Kevin's sister who does not want her to be a part of Kevin's life. Then, Kevin's ex-fiancee comes back to town. On top of that, her cookie line is not getting rave reviews from the test audience.I felt that some of the characters seemed like caricatures, especially Kevin's sister who resembled Cruella de Ville. There were quite a few of the story elements that seemed very predictable, such as when Deidre is googling on her cell phone when driving and gets into an accident. It's a light read, but there are more entertaining chick lit books out there to take to the beach."}, {"userName": "Jenn O'Brien", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2054052-jenn-o-brien", "userReview": "I enjoyed this sequel as much as I did the original. The characters are not stagnant, they are growing and changing in a natural progression, they are facing new problems and challenges, which makes it a fun read. My only question is what happened to Claire? Except for one sentence mentioning her, she has all but disappeared from the family.I\u2019m glad the reader learned more detail and background about characters who were background in the first book. Several new characters were introduced in this book and some of the storylines were left dangling - paving the way to a third book in the seriesI like the sparring between Deirdre and her frienemy Marla.

This is the sequel to Good Things and it was just a fun read. The books have recipes and are light and believable. They take place in Seattle which I love as I lived in that area for close to 30 years.

I definitely enjoy books that weave in any storyline around food/cooking/entertaining and this is no exception. I'm so glad to have discovered Mia King- I think she is a fantastic writer, good stories that are essentially a \"romance\" and perhaps a dash of \"chick lit\" but it feels several steps above that. The story line seems REAL. I love a good chick lit book but sometimes the story can get so outrageous it can be insulting to one's intelligence. I definitely LOVE Mia King, as a nice light but addicting read with real characters - characters that could easily be plucked out of my own life."}, {"userName": "S", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1839488-s", "userReview": "This is an enjoyable quick chick lit novel. However I feel as though it is a sequel, since it appears that there were references to a previous time without much back story.
