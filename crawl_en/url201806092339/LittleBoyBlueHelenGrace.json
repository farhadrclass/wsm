Things they want to hide. Even from their closest friends and their family. These secrets, if found out, could destroy a person\u2019s career, their family and their entire existence.  Men and women go out alone at night. To a place they have been several times before. Looking, searching, hopeful, excited. For one man, the night does not end the way he hoped. In fact, for him, it is his last. Helen Grace knew this man. Knew him well, in fact. Her team is sent in to investigate, yet if she divulges her connection to him, the secrets she has kept hidden for so long, will come out. Helen\u2019s fate and the fate of others is entirely in her own hands - or so she thinks. M. J. Arlidge\u2019s \u201cLittle Boy Blue\u201d is a novel that filled me with a myriad of emotions. It had me clenching my fists, waiting with bated breath, scared half out of my wits from the very first chapter all the way to it\u2019s stunning, breathtaking conclusion. Having now read 6 books in this series (as I read one out of order), M. J. Arlidge has me so invested in the characters that I was sobbing at certain point in this novel. What can I say? I just love these characters - some of them are extremely relatable and real - even when you wouldn\u2019t expect them to be. I feel like I\u2019m friends with some of them (the good ones that is: Helen and Charlie - in case you were wondering!). \u201cLittle Boy Blue\u201d is one phenomenal thriller and is one of the best books in the Helen Grace series. If you haven\u2019t started this series yet, all I have to say is, what are you waiting for?! This was a Traveling Sister read with Brenda and Kaceey. I LOVE reading this series with them as they love Helen Grace and Charlie Brooks as much as I do. Having read book 6 \u201cHide & Seek\u201d in this series first by mistake, I will be anxiously waiting for them to read it so we can read book 7, \u201cLove Me Not\u201d together. Thanks M. J.

Arlidge. Helen Grace is called to the scene of a murder inside a club ironically called the Torture Room. A cozy, little hide-away catering to clientele who, surprise\u2026enjoy S&M. Could this just be an \u201cadult game\u201d taken too far? Or is this indeed a malicious murder?Helen and her ever-changing squad of detectives have their hands full as they dive deep into this subculture looking for answers. Meanwhile, as in previous books, Helen finds herself alone in her quest to find justice. We flew through this book over one weekend and all thoroughly enjoyed! I\u2019m loving all the characters...both the good and bad! As always, Charlie still remains my favorite! It appears that M.J. Arlidge is determined not to allow Helen to have one moment of peace! It seems everyone either turns on her or ends up dying around her! The poor woman just cannot catch a break!! I\u2019m really hoping she can find some happiness and peace in one of these books! Fingers crossed for her as I start book six\u2026 Hide and Seek.

Well, it was bound to happen. Helen\u2019s personal life and professional life are about to have a head on crash and it\u2019s not pretty.When Helen is called to the scene of a crime, it becomes her absolute worst nightmare. Without saying too much, Helen is- shall we say- acquainted with the victim. Desperate to keep her dark secret from being exposed, Helen begins to lose her grip on the investigation and her behavior becomes erratic. Charlie, however, seems to have grown a backbone which strains her relationship with Helen. Can Helen close this case and keep her hidden peccadilloes from becoming public knowledge or have the chickens finally come home to roost? Oy! This was a very intense story! From start to finish this one kept me on edge- and I mean the white knuckle, I can hardly bear to watch, nail biting, kind of suspense that should come with a warning label. This installment reminded me of that old \u2018Godfather\u2019 quote: Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in. Just when Helen had begun to distance herself from her secret, lurid underground life, she is plunged neck deep into the most horrifying scenario she could have imagined. It's almost surreal. Once more, Helen finds herself trolling the dark recesses of the BDSM clubs, only this time, she\u2019s looking for a killer. It goes without saying that Helen will have to handle this case with kid gloves, and it has her feeling jumpy and out of sorts, as she worries about her own connection to the murder. But, as the story progresses, a plot is revealed that just might be Arlidge\u2019s most diabolical one to date. If you follow this series, you know that\u2019s really saying something. I got behind on this series, but now I\u2019m glad I did, because after that \u2018to be continued\u2019 conclusion, I won\u2019t have to sit on pins and needles waiting for the next installment to come out before I can find out what happens next!! Once again, Arlidge sucked me right into his cleverly spun web, trapping me inside the confounds of Helen Grace\u2019s world, which is not always the most pleasant place to be, and is one you enter at your own risk, because once you step inside her world, you can not, not even for one tiny moment let your guard down. 4.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Skyler Autumn", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12859342-skyler-autumn", "userReview": "[ After watching your favourite detective fall so far it's going to be amazing to watch her rise and fuck up those that went against her I'm talking about you Detective Superintendent Jonathon Gardam you perverted little prick (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Gary", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15055195-gary", "userReview": "I have read all four of the previous releases by MJ Arlidge in the DI Helen Grace series so when I was offered the chance to read the latest release I was looking forward to it.Although it can be read as a stand alone novel I think it works better when you read each book in order so that you get a true feeling for the sub plots.The lead character is DI Helen Grace, a no nonsense woman whose private life is littered with dark secrets. In this book Helen investigates the shocking and unexpected murder of a close friend found cocooned in plastic. It looks like it was a tragic accident - a sex game gone wrong. The investigation soon threatens to expose Helen's private life and she has to make some tough personal choices along the way, as she hunts a twisted and elusive killer, who is swiftly racking up more murders. As Helen closes in on her prey, a shocking truth is revealed - these murders are part of a calculated attempt to bring Helen down.This book is full of suspense which made it a quick read for me as I found it difficult to put the book down. I found this book as good if not better than the previous four and I eagerly await the next one in the series.I would like to thank Net Galley and Penguin UK for giving me a copy of the latest MJ Arlidge novel in exchange for a honest review."}, {"userName": "Tracy Fenton", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18478389-tracy-fenton", "userReview": "MJ Arlidge latest book in the Helen Grace series does not disappoint...actually it does I am really disappointed it ended! What a thrilling, fast paced edge of your seat story delving deep into the murky world of BDSM. If you haven't read this series yet... why not?

Anyway, I'm really thankful that I have the next book as an audiobook was well since this one ended with a frustrating cliffhanger. I'm also glad I did not read the book and then had to wait until the next book was published!In Little Boy Blue must Helene Grace tackle a very personal case. The murder victim is someone that she knew, but for reasons can't she tell her fellow colleagues that she knew the person in question. Now, she has to keep her emotions in check while trying to find the devious murderer. But, how long can she hide the truth?As usual, has M.J. Arlidge written a thriller that from the start captivated me. I quite enjoy listening to this book. Elizabeth Bower is a great narrator, and her ability to change her voice for all the characters make it easy to know who is who. Also, the book is so thrilling that the hours just fly away when you're listening to the book.I did suspect the identity of the killer, I'm not quite sure when it hit me who the person probably would be. However, it made the book more interesting to listen to. Was I right about my suspicious or not made the book more thrilling? Btw, yes I was right...Little Boy Blue is just as the previous books brilliant. I do recommend reading this series from the beginning and not from book two as I did. This is a series that definitely is best suited to read in order."}, {"userName": "Aditi", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16069171-aditi", "userReview": "\u201cWe should forgive our enemies, but not before they are hanged\u201d  ----Heinrich HeineM.J. Arlidge, the bestselling English author, pens an exciting new thriller in his DI Helen Grace series, Little Boy Blue that is the fifth book in the series as it revolves around the life of DI Helen Grace getting sucked into yet another mind-boggling murder mystery and this time the killer preys on someone who is close to Helen Grace. But it is difficult for Helen to confess the fact that she knew the victim personally as that might open the door to her other life that she has kept hidden from the public eyes for so long. Synopsis: Detective Inspector Helen Grace is no stranger to tragedy. But when a body is found in a Southampton nightclub, the death cuts too close to the bone. Hiding her personal connection to the victim - and a double-life which must remain secret at all costs - Helen becomes a woman possessed, working her team around the clock to chase down every lead. As the killer strikes again, the investigation takes its toll not only on Helen but also her senior officers. Tempers flare, friendships fray and Helen faces an impossible choice. Confess her sins and lose control of the case? Or keep living a lie, protecting her darkest secrets, and risk getting trapped in this tangled web? But whatever she does, this killer will not stop until the truth is revealed: there are some fates worse than death. Detective Inspector Helen Grace has got a new case- to find the killer who has murdered a man in a S&M nightclub, by luring the man with the prospect of BDSM. This victim is close to Helen but unfortunately Helen can't confess about it as that might put her a subject of mockery, joke and shame in the eyes of her colleagues. And as the killer strikes again, it is clear that the killer wants to unravel the other life of Helen which she has kept hidden from the eyes of her colleagues and friends. Will Helen fall for the killer's traps before she confesses about her secret life?I've been fortunate enough to finally get my hands on the book by the master mystery storyteller, M.J. Arlidge. I know after reading this book, I definitely need to grab the previous books by this author. Nowadays it is so difficult to find a good crime fiction that will not easily give away the identity of the killer before its climax. And I'm so grateful that I finally found one such book that kept me questioning, anticipating and puzzling till the very end. Moreover, the primary character is equally complex like the plot and kept me on my edges with her unforeseeable moves.The author's writing style is absolutely eloquent, laced with suspense and thrill. The narrative is highly engaging enough to keep the readers glued till the very last page. This fast-paced, gripping pot-boiler has an excellent and articulate plot that is easy to comprehend to for the readers. The author explains everything in this book so expressively that it is bound to make the readers feel like they are watching this whole intriguing story with their own eyes. The mystery is tightly wrapped under thousands of layers of twists and turns that are unraveled eventually by the author. The plot is so addictive yet unpredictable that the readers are bound to search for the identity of the killer like a moth looking for a ray of light in the darkness. The author has depicted the story line strikingly by featuring adrenaline rushing action scenes and frightening events and scenes that will make the readers turn the pages of the book till the very end despite the vivid horror and raw violence.The author here opens the lesser-known world of S&M widely and letting his readers to be enlightened by its knowledge. The author did a thorough research in this subject as he diligently portrays everything under this subject like the objects used for BDSM, the kind of sadistic people who involve themselves in this dark world, the painful tortures to achieve sexual pleasures, etc. Yes it might definitely frighten some readers with the in-depth details and it might excite a few readers.The primary character, Helen Grace who is the protagonist of Arlidge's books, is highly well developed with her flaws, shortcomings, complexities and her emotions. Yes she is bound to make the readers hungry for action and non-nonsense drama. The author projects her so strongly into the story that it feels like she is getting inside the heads of the readers messing with it, in short, she will have that psychological grip inside the heads of the readers. The supporting characters are equally well-etched out with their flaws and negative attributes. In a nutshell, this a must read page-turner that is captivating and highly thrilling from the first page to the very last where it ends with a cliffhanger that will make the readers look out for the next book in the series.Verdict:  A must read thrilling page-turner. Courtesy:  Thanks to the author, M.J. Arlidge's publicist, for giving me the opportunity to read and review this book."}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5903843-matt", "userReview": "First and foremost, a large thank you to NetGalley, M.J. Arlidge, and Berkley Publishing Group for providing me with a copy of this book, which allows me to provide you with this review.It has all led up to this, in Arlidge's sensational DI Helen Grace series. Four well-crafted novels, full of psychological intrigue and laced with character backstories, have built-up to this novel, one that pushes Grace into the spotlight and uses all the loose threads of past plots to create a masterpiece. When DI Grace and her team are called to the scene of a murder at an S&M club, no one is sure what to expect. A man is found, bound so tightly that he suffocated, though no one saw anything out of the ordinary. When he is unmasked, Grace's personal life spins out of control, as the victim is none other than Jake Elder, her former dominator. Grace scrambles to keep a straight face as she vows not to let this dark secret interfere with the investigation or become common knowledge amongst other team members. There is significant infighting within the team as they jockey for spots and positions of power, leaving Grace to keep them in line as she hides her defensiveness. The secrets do not end there, for series readers know all too well about Emilia Garanita, the roving crime reporter who is regularly up in Grace's craw but also knows the aforementioned deep secret. During the jockeying for power, Garanita leaks this information to a member of the team, which blows the investigation wide open. While Grace has her own misgivings about her personal choices, a second dominator is found murdered, someone with whom Grace had a brief and very poisoned S&M relationship. Grace panics and spills her secret to her superior, who relishes knowing all this, as he has been courting a secret crush on her and uses this to draw ever closer. Remaining a single step ahead of everyone, Grace is summoned to the home of her current and infrequent dominator, who has recently been killed. Someone is targeting her and she may have discovered the link, though she is in the crosshairs of her own team, who seek not only to out her as a social misfit, but a murderer. Will DI Helen Grace be able to outmaneuver her team long enough to catch the killer, or has this house of cards finally come crashing down around her? Arlidge has concocted a novel of such impact at a poignant point in the series that readers will be left shocked and stunned with the cliffhanger presented to them.I am almost unable to put my thoughts into words as I seek to review this novel. I sped through this series, not out of obligation but because they read so easily. I was pulled in by the crisp style that Arlidge has to offer in his lightning-fast chapters, as well as the varied style in which DI Helen Grace is presented; a superior police detective with a dark side of her own. While some have come out and called Arlidge the new Jo Nesb\u00f8, I feel this is both a disservice to both authors, as well as to Helen Grace and Harry Hole. Grace effectively balances her personal life and the need to release her tension in a way that does not interfere with what she leaves at the office. As is mentioned throughout the series, Grace has no family of her own, save an estranged nephew, and can easily find herself at the mercy of her work life. Arlidge seems to have laid the groundwork for this novel in the previous four, from the character backstories to the dramatic revelations made to certain characters and the means by which the team has changed. While still falling into the psychological serial killer genre, this novel is much more personal, from the opening paragraph to the final sentence and Helen Grace is firmly rooted in the spotlight throughout. Series readers will lap it up, but those seeking to test to waters ought not begin their Helen Grace journey here, for numerous reasons. Stunning developments that I still am trying to organise in my head!Kudos, Mr. Arlidge for knocking me off my feet with this one. How I can have devoured so much in such a short time speaks volumes to your writing abilities and my interest in your work.

see where DI Helen Grace's story was going to go. Closer to home it would seem.... much closer!We start off with a body that Grace recognises and throws everything around her into disarray. Taking us in Grace's secret world; a sex act appears to have gone wrong launching the DI into an investigation that becomes emotionally difficult to say the least. Cut to some time later and another body turns up that Grace knows. Are the cases linked? If so, could they be led back to Grace herself? What follows is an investigation that could lead into a world that Grace wants to keep strictly private but how does she do that without arousing suspicion all around her?The usual players from the previous books are there and though this could be read as a standalone, it makes much more sense and frankly a whole lot would be lost if the previous books weren't read beforehand. As for the book itself, I wanted to love this way more than I actually did. There's nothing wrong with the premise and the writing hasn't changed, short, sharp punchy chapters follow one after the other to keep the reader interested. But, I don't know, I just couldn't quite get there into the 'excited zone.' It took me over a week to read and for one of Arlidge's books (for me anyways), that's quite long. It just didn't have the same ratcheting tension that previous books had and at times I found myself not really caring where it was all going. Actually I kind of had an idea where it was three quarters of the way through; so the ending came as no surprise. What it has done is left it all on an enough of a cliffhanger for me to want to carry on with the series.Looking ahead, I would like to see DI Grace get more of a grip of herself, and for female leads to not so often appear to be falling apart every which way. It is possible? Isn't it?! It does get tiresome after a while - the gung ho attitude!For hard bitten fans of Arlidge's books in this series, it's another competent continuation. Personally I'm hoping for a tad more in the next one.

Put another way, if you want to find out how (or whether) lead character detective inspector Helen Grace gets out of the tangled mess she's in at the end of this one, you'll have to wait till the next installment is published. I must say that ending, or the lack thereof, rather annoyed the heck out of me. But other than that, this is a doggone kick-butt book. In fact, I had a hard time putting it down. Thankfully, the chapters are short so it's easy to get in one or two while the coffeepot finishes up or even during commercials as I watched a favorite TV show. It's a fast-paced plot with enough murders to make the Boston Strangler wish he'd lived in merry old Southhampton. The plot also smacks of kinky; in fact, it begins with a murder in a popular S&M club called the Torture Rooms. How bad? Well, I know I'm not fully cognizant of the words and phrases common to this fetish, but I admit to having to look up the definition of one or two. Understandably, secrecy is the order of business here; and when Helen sees the victim and realizes they knew each other, she nearly panics. That's a part of her life she really doesn't want revealed, but she knows keeping her proclivities to herself will become more difficult as the investigation progresses. Then, the unthinkable happens: Another murder, and once again, the victim is connected to Helen.Clearly, Helen has issues - some of them whoppers - but then so does just about every person she works with in the department. And that doesn't count a bulldog-like journalist, once Helen's friend, who's sniffing in all the corners and under the beds in hopes of making Helen suffer and landing the scoop that will boost her career to the stratosphere. This is, for the record, No. 5 in the series; I've read (and enjoyed) one other, so I was delighted to be approved by the publisher to read it in exchange for an honest review. For the most part it stands alone, although it was clear here and there that I'd have had a better understanding of some things had I read earlier editions. For that reason, I'll give the same advice I always do to readers of books in any series: For best results, start from the beginning."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27246754-sarah", "userReview": "Little Boy Blue is the fifth book in the Helen Grace series. I have to say I think the author gives enough background information in this book, so for any readers new to this series I think it does work well as a stand alone, though having read all the books in the series, believe me you will want to read them after reading this one.I have loved all the books in the series and after finishing each book I think that, that particular book is the best one yet. Well let me tell you that Little Boy Blue is with out a doubt the best book in the series, hands down!With a shocking first chapter, the author had me well and truly gripped right from the off. The whole storyline is uncomfortably to close to home for Helen and tensions between Helen and her colleagues are at the highest levels ever.I think due to the nature of this case, it has Helen as well as the reader on edge straight away. It has to be one of the most darkest and dangerous cases to date for Helen as her whole career depends on finding the killer.Little Boy Blue is without a doubt a tense and edge of your seat read. There are so many shocks in store, not only for the readers but for Helen also. I have no idea how M J Arlidge manages to up the level of each book, but he has, and with Little Boy Blue he has not only raised the bar he has totally obliterated it! Without a doubt one of my top reads for 2016!Many thanks to Netgalley and Penguin UK \u2013 Michael Joseph for an Advanced Readers Copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Esther", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42963501-esther", "userReview": "This series definitely gets better with the books to come.

As soon as I started I was straight back into Helen\u2019s world and was absorbed within a matter of a few chapters. One thing I will point out is that although you may well be able to read this as a standalone book, it is made so much better by the fact that I have been following the series. You have a real sense of the characters and their history and how each path has been crossed with other people. Helen is an outstanding character and as many readers will know she has her own secrets which will put her firmly in the firing line in this latest book.A body is found to start us off, only this time it\u2019s found at a Southampton nightclub which was hosting a fetish ball and as soon as Helen arrives she realises that she has her own personal connection to the murder. This alone makes for an outstanding read, but add in all the other factors such as the return of favourite characters and I knew this would be a full5 star read and I wasn\u2019t even halfway.Helen\u2019s superior Gardam made for such a good thread to the story I had no idea where the story would go with it until it smacked me around the face (I didn\u2019t see that coming). We also see Helen\u2019s juniors Sanderson and Brooks fighting for their position as Helen\u2019s right hand woman. The murders continue to increase and every plot thread added to the tension and ratcheted up the nerve endings. By the time the last quarter of the book was upon me, all thoughts of dinner, washing and anything else remotely house related went straight out the window. The real kicker was the ending. It was a real OMG moment and I was FURIOUS that Arlidge has left us hanging. It was so good it was bad (if you know what I mean). All I can say is I am literally on tenterhooks waiting for the next book which is due for release on 8 September 2016. An absolutely brilliant book which I think is Arlidge\u2019s best yet and I cannot recommend this series highly enough."}, {"userName": "CL", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10871763-cl", "userReview": "I have read all of the Helen Grace stories and I have to say this is the best so far.

Although the books are written in third person, I feel the author develops Helen\u2019s character well and I love the fact she is not your typical female lead.

She is a TOTAL badass. Plus, she hangs around in my old manor, so she must be alright. I've enjoyed every one of MJ Arlidge's books in the Helen Grace series, but this one blew me away. Starting with a shocking murder, one that made me stop for a minute as I couldn't quite believe it (and I recommend you read the others in the series so that you can fully appreciate the impact of the murder in this book!), the team are thrown into the murky world of S&M to try and uncover the killer. As usual, Arlidge treats us to a fast-paced roller-coaster ride, with this latest instalment being, in my opinion, the best one yet. The killer is revealed, and is someone that I was NOT expecting, and the explosive ending is superb - I, for one, am definitely left hanging, desperately hoping that Arlidge gets pen to paper as soon as possible, because I cannot WAIT for the next Helen Grace novel."}, {"userName": "Tonya Smith", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28078351-tonya-smith", "userReview": "I liked it.

Initially this was driven by the incisive writing style of M.J. Arlidge which ensures the pace never relents and builds a mounting sense of tension as each of the chapters races past. Alongside this the series also features the indomitable DI Helen Grace who makes for one of the most fascinating characters in modern crime friction. Hard as nails in the working environment, Helen is pure steel and determination as she powers into the fray on her Kawasaki and motorbike leathers. A no-nonsense woman she wears her heart on her sleeve and has won battles with both her superiors and her enemies. Curiously set apart from the team Helen is notoriously private outside of the workplace and the fact that she is such a loner and tormented by the miseries of her past adds a realistic fragility to her character.Attempts to undermine Helen has been a running theme in the series, from superiors through to subordinates and local journalist Emilia Garanita and this fifth outing continues in that vein and also brings Helen's complicated personal life to the fore. When DI Grace is called to a notorious BDSM nightclub in Southampton she is shocked to discover that she can identify the victim. Helen keeps quiet about her connection to the man but pretty soon the team get the sense that she is more edgy than ever and that this case has unnerved her. When a second victim is identified the connections become impossible for Helen to ignore and she is faced with a decision to confess her sins and risk being taken off the case or to keep quiet and hunt the killer down and ensure justice prevails. Helen wrestles with her conscience and is forced to question whether she is guilty of being wilfully blind to the clues and has hindered the team.With the sparks flying and DI Grace on tenterhooks the team are unsettled and is doesn't take long for the newly promoted Charlie Brooks and DS Sanderson to engage is a battle of office politics as they vie to become the DS of choice and heir apparent to Helen Grace. The battle for superiority threatens to derail the progress of the case and with Helen's nemesis and local journalist waiting in the wings with a lurid headline and hellbent on causing trouble this makes for an explosive read.Aside from my adoration of Helen Grace from a purely objective standpoint I feel duty bound to point out that this was the first of the series where things seemed to get a little over the top and were taken a stretch too far. I was also of the opinion that after a great build-up the ending felt a little overly rushed and things were wrapped up just a little too neatly. Although my least favourite of the series so far, it was a compulsive read and I enjoyed every minute of it. Whilst I must admit to being a little underwhelmed by this novel in contrast to the previous four instalments it has not diminished my enthusiasm for the writing of M.J. Arlidge. The premise for this fifth in the series always made it difficult to envisage the status quo remaining at Southampton and I am eager to know how things progress. Whilst It was fairly obvious to me who was behind the murders from reasonably early on, M. J. Arlidge still delivered a final twist and the ending of Little Boy Blue was a surprise and a brilliant hook for the launch of Hide and Seek later in the year.Whilst Little Boy Blue can be read as a standalone as is the case for all of the DI Helen Grace novels, I really do think that maximum enjoyment will be best delivered if readers have an appreciation of the back story and the events which Helen has been through. The series has crossed into her personal history on several occasions and is well worth investing your time in and comes very highly recommended."}], "description": "Detective Helen Grace faces her own dark compulsions in the twisty new thriller from the author of Pop Goes the Weasel and Eeny Meeny.In the darkest corners of the city, there is a thriving nightlife where people can let loose and cross the lines of work and play, of pleasure and pain.
