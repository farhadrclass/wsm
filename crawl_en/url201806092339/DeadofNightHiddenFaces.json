I appreciated the Christian Fiction/Crime-Mystery merge. There were things I definitely liked, but it also tipped in the other direction. I liked the plot. It was intriguing and had some twists that were well placed.My main two complaints may be linked. I didn't care for the MC. I prefer the MC to be a little stronger and not a complete mess, especially when they have to carry the entire book. My dislike of her might be linked to the narrator. I listened to the audio and it felt way over acted and the MC came across as super whiny.

I like the complexity of her plot, and the plot ideas are quite clever and engaging, at least in the two books I've read.But I just can't take the writing style. First, I'm not at all a big fan of first person. It's a form of emotional dissonance to me, trying to force me into pretending I'm the main character when I know I'm not and I frankly don't want to be. I don't read a novel to experience what the main character experiences. I want a good plot without all the extra \"please identify with my main character\" stuff. The action and plot are what I care about.So I should enjoy a novel such as this because the plot is good, right? I should. But I don't because of the weird phrases and ways of saying things this author has. The beginning and the endings are the worst for these things (although there often are a few scattered throughout). It's almost like those two parts are overworked, like the author thinks she can twist words/metaphors around to make them sound clever when they just come across as rather pompous or nonsensical. They drag me right out of the story, and that's especially not something you want to happen when the reader is in the middle of the climax action. I had a really hard time getting past a very early reference to a dead body as smelling sweet like rotting vegetables. One, rotting vegetables can in no way be described as a sweet smell. And two, my dad was a renderer so I KNOW what dead animals smell like, which is similar to dead humans. NO WAY they are described as sweet. Ever. Ever. Just never.I hate it that these things have come up in both books because I think if it weren't for the first person and the pretentious words pictures in places, I would probably enjoy this author otherwise. But sadly, I can't get past these things. They make me want to throw the book across the room (especially those few at the end, right in the middle of the action). Sorry.Oh, and as for the sister interactions in this, a couple of scenes between the two dragged on a bit and didn't seem to provide much to the plot.The plot itself was good, well-researched and very believable."}, {"userName": "Lisa Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7092311-lisa-johnson", "userReview": "Title: Dead of Night (Hidden Faces #3)Author: Brandilyn CollinsPages: 457 (large type edition)Year: 2005Publisher: Thorndike Press (large type)Annie Kingston is back in this third installment of the Hidden Faces series. This time she is tasked with drawing lifelike images of the murdered victims of a serial killer. She also is still dealing with her son\u2019s poor choices and behavior as he gets involved with drug dealers. Her sister has also moved in with her to help her \u201cbabysit\u201d her son. She has a great deal of stress in her life and realizes the only way she can cope is with prayer. She has dedicated at least \u00bd hour every day to reading her Bible and prayer so she can face the day and its challenges. She also begins to realize her next door neighbor, Dave, is interested in more the friendship. Is she ready for a relationship when her life has so much chaos? As the murders become more frequent, Annie learns she knows one of the victims. The killer is becoming more and more brazen. Who will be next? Can Annie do anything to stop this killer?I couldn\u2019t put this book down. There was so much suspense, action and mystery in the plot I was hooked from the first page. Having read the first two books in the series, coming in contact with the same characters again was like meeting old friends. Annie is now such a strong woman of faith, so much more than she realizes. I loved the emphasis on the power of prayer, especially as a weapon against evil and in the maturation of the relationship between God and His children. I would recommend reading the first two books in the series before this one as they serve to introduce the characters in book one and then further develop them in book two. This was a great book!My rating is 5 stars.Note: The opinions shared in this review are solely my responsibility. Other reviews can be read at http://seekingwithallyurheart.blogspo....

The plot (a Christian-focused serial killer novel) is pretty interesting. There is some decent suspense. And the identity of the killer was a nice twist.But the main character was not likeable to me. That is the result of two situations. The first was when she got angry at the police for not doing anything about her son getting beat up. Well the reason they didn't do anything was because he son (who is also awful) wouldn't talk. The second issue I had about her was how easily she got tricked in the end of the book.The ending of the book was kind of lazy. The identity of the killer was a twist, mainly because it didn't make any sense. The two other people I thought might have been the killer had reasons. The real killer? None, and the author never gives any motive. The author also left a few of the relationships unnecessarily open. The main character seemed to have two guys interested in her but the book end with absolutely no resolution whatsoever. Lastly, I don't particularly love the author. I'm not taking about the writing style but the author herself. Especially early in the book, she makes use of some stereotypes about race and rap music. Alienating an entire race isn't exaactly the best way to spread the Christian message.In the end, this was a decent book that could have been much better. I know the book is by a Christian publisher but the message often overpowered the plot. This wouldn't have been as big an issue is it had been done in a good way. Unfortunately it was not. Instead, the message was expressed in a way that many non-Christians take issue with; in a shove it down your throat and sometimes close-minded fashion."}, {"userName": "C.J.

That same day she discovers the sixth victim of a serial killer in the woods on her property. Placed there randomly? Or is the killer trying to taunt her?Book #3 in the Hidden Faces series continues the saga of forensic artist Annie Kingston with page-turning intensity. Not only must Annie draw the victims of the killer for identification, she must also face the escalating consequences of her teenage son's rebellion and the challenges of living out her new-found faith. Interspersed throughout the first person narrative are chillingly evil, yet often strikingly poetic, scenes in the killer's point of view. I was reminded of Edgar Allen Poe's story \"The Telltale Heart\" as I read them.With this novel, and the rest of the Hidden Faces series, Brandilyn Collins has pushed the envelope in the emerging genre of Christian crime fiction. She's not afraid to tell it like it is, yet spares us the gratuitous details most secular crime writers thrive on. That said, DEAD OF NIGHT isn't just about crime and its aftermath. It's also about the power of prayer.

Each book in this series just gets better! Truly suspenseful. This time around during the climax of the book I found myself pulling my feet up off of the floor and scrunching my face, reading with one eye open as the latest victim, always Annie Kingston at some point, was literally on the brink of death!Typically, when things run in series it seems on number 2 or 3 the steam runs out - not the case here! And just when you think she will wind up the dilemmas she doesn't, she amps them up! I should have mentioned earlier, in my first review, but forgot. Not sure about everyone else, but as a serious reader I think of myself as \"literate\". Brandilyn Collins has sent me to the dictionary more than a dozen times over the course of these past 3 books. The first couple times I thought, \"nah, probably won't see that word again in my lifetime\" but then she kept using it or added to the bank of \"unknowns\" in my brain! So I had to crack the old dictionary.Here are some of the words I'm proud to say I've learned, but haven't necessarily memorized :-)portent, pique, roiling, miasma, nonplus-ed, enervation, obsequious, darkling, sibilance, banal, denizens, morose, minutiae, insipidity, insouciance, pas de deux, nascent and drosser!Happy Reading!"}, {"userName": "Marissa", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/173542-marissa", "userReview": "I took a little hiatus between book 2 and book 3 in this series. Fortunately, one really doesn't involve the other much when it comes to the main crime storyline. There are occasional references to the previous family situations but they cover that pretty well. As for the main plot...what a horrible way to die! As soon as I thought I thought I figured out who the murderer was on 2 occasions. Boy was I wrong! Never saw that one coming until the end. Collins did a good job playing out the storyline. Some parts were a little too detailed and they became stale, but she was still able to keep the pages turning. Also, there was a little too much \"God/Jesus/prayer\" in this book for me. That's fine if that's your thing, but I felt like it was almost pushed on to me as a reader.
