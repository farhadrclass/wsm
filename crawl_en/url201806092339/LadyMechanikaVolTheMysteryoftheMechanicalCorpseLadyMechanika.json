When I saw the cover of this comic on NetGalley I said to myself why not give it a try as the cover looks promising. The artist who could draw so good must have an interesting story to tell. And I wasn't disappointed a bit.\nOh my God the artwork! \nI can look at the artwork for hours and hours. The illustration, the detailing, the colors are all just so so amazing. \nAnd the story! Too good! \nThe story is full of action - a lot of action. There is element of suspense, thrill and mystery. A lot of twists and turns kept me on the edge. Lady Mechanika - A lady who has mechanical limbs but no memory of her past. She is smart, fearless and determined to find out who did this to her. She thought she was the only one like that - part machine, part human being. To her surprise she found out she wasn't anymore. There was a mechanical corpse of a young girl. While investigating for the death of the poor girl, she unraveled mystery of some unique people and uncovered horrendous experiments of a science maniac.Although I have read this volume but I still want to add this beautiful comic to my collection so I can read and admire the artwork anytime.I can't wait to read the next volume.

And what soulless thing is left behind?\"The entire takes place in a steampunk city called \"Mechanika\" that was built by the greatest minds of this Victorian-rooted world.Lady Mechanika is our titular character who is an ass-kicking, name-taking kind of gal. She's on the lookout for another mechanical lady who reportedly ripped through a dozen soldiers before collapsing in a train station. Lady M investigates the doctor who helped her. And boy do we get steamrolled by this quirky, gorgeously stylised comic and its simultaneously slow-burning but gunfire-pace story. And Lady Mechanika. I just love her. But I'll get into why a little later.The Characters and the Banter: A Study in MechanicLady Mechanika is one of the most complex heroines I've read of late. She's extremely empathetic:Sarcastic and knows how to handle bratty kids:Deadly:And with a deep, deeply troubling past and tics that go with it (she hates being touched): Then we have LewisI love Lewis. He's the Watson to Mechanika's Sherlock, except much more useful than Watson. \"Is alrigh' doctor. No offense taken. I was forunate enough I didn' have a father wot disapproved of m' tinkerin', or anything else for tha' mat'er. Never actually knew the bloke. I just love their banter!!!He's an alcoholic sidekick who's a good-for-nothing jack-of-all-trades. Bit of an oxymoron but hey, you'd understand if you read (and you should) this comic. And Lewis gets really worried about Lady Mechanika in such a brotherly way. It's very sweet. But he's lost some important people in his life.Character expositionYou're never told outright about the characters' past, but given little hints. We only know what Lady Mechanika knows - everything else is for us to snoop out. All the characters' pasts underlie the narrative and run beneath the surface of the very busy plot. I can't begin to describe the complexities of this comic and all of its themes. This comic is a fantastic example of show and not tell. What I also loved:\"I may not be superstitious, but I've found there's usually a kernel of truth in every story, even the rubbish printed in the tabloids.\"Mechanika is one fine lady, but she's still smart and she never uses her looks for seduction. She's a serious kind of woman. I hate that people seem to have a problem with stereotypically beautiful women portrayed in comics. She has so much more depth, sass and emotion seeping from all the corners of her lovely dresses.There's a certified Romani cirque du freak, and they're just awesome (With some real lessons on family bonds)And finally, the bad guys: \"But unless we can find the strength to confront those painful memories and accept them...\"Both Commander Winter and Blackpool have a very complex, gritted past they share with either Lewis or Lady M. Blackpool has quite the strapping jawline teeehee\"Our minds have mechanisms designed to protect us from those unberable realistic that life may at times lay upon us.\"ConclusionI've given this five stars abut I feel there is something small missing that could make the story totter off the edge of caution and fall into a pool of greatness. BUT THIS STYLE IS SO DAMN GORGEOUS MY EYES ARE BURNING.I truly love how show-and-not-tell is used here. I love that Lady Mechanika breaks stereotypes and isn't a typical Court of Thorn and Roses bad-ass who can do absolutely anything and must be worshipped for her prowess. Nope. She's a flawed human with a bit of junk in the trunk.Edit: Spelling and grammar"}, {"userName": "Gabrielle", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6753400-gabrielle", "userReview": "This comic has so much stuff that I love in it: steampunk machines, awesome Victorian outfits, a freaking circus!The Lady Mechanika is a famous huntress, who was once the subject of a gruesome experiment that resulted in her arms and legs being replaced by mechanical limbs and that changed her eyes to creepy black and red peepers. In this story, she investigates the death of a young girl with similar mechanical apparatus for arms, in the hopes of also figuring out who grafted her artificial limbs on and what her life was before this transformation, as she has no memory of who she was before.The story is fun and action packed and the artwork is absolutely stunning, with all the awesome steampunk hallmarks like goggles, automatons and weird air-crafts gorgeously drawn up. That being said, the emphasis on the main character's boobs ended up annoying me. Seriously, I know this is a graphic novel, but it was a bit much. The point of strong female character is that they kick ass without an exploitation of their sexual features... or maybe that's just my personal hopes and dreams...Anyhoo, besides that grating aspect, the graphic novel was very enjoyable!

Started in 2010 this series never got a fair publishing shot as it was infrequent and never completed. Kudos to Joe Benitez for never letting this series and character fall into oblivion. To read this review and more please visit my blog at Epic ReadingFor those who are not big comic fans let me assure you while these are comics there is a lot of story here. This set of 6 comics probably has more writing than a full 50 comic run of any other superhero comic you can think of. The art is rich and beautiful, the mystery is intricate and who doesn't love steampunk!! If you love The Lunar Chronicles (Cinder, book 1) then I believe you will love this story (and hey sometimes pretty pictures are a great break from dense reading). For those who already love comics, Lady Mechanika deserves to stand next to other leading ladies series like Dawn, Vampirella, Witchblade and more! I highly recommend this series if you love fantasy, science fiction or steampunk , even if it's your first foray into comics, it's a solid choice. Please note: I received an eARC of this book from the publisher via NetGalley.

It's pretty, and steampunk, and has a badass lady cyborg whole fights crime. But I've read too many amazing graphic novels (just in the past year alone!) to be able to overlook its underwhelmingness. Don't get me wrong, it's not terrible! It's kind of fun, if slight. But.* can we move past Badass ladies with cartoonishly swollen balloon tits? I refuse to use the words breasts, they're not breasts. They're clearly tits, in the \"you ridiculous tit\" sense. These boobs are idiotic. LADY FIGHTERS WOULD STRAP THAT SHIT DOWN OR HAVE A REDUCTION. large boobs HURT when you run or jump or bounce and get punched in them. They are IMPRACTICAL. And LM is corseted to within an inch of her life - she has great outfits, except for those TITS which are just HANGING OUT THERE in lacy, unsupportive bits of fabric. My back ached just looking at that.*see also LM's porn lips. Don't think they had lip injections in those days gentlemen.* There's a certain kind of writer that can't tell the difference between \"adorable, precocious child\" and \"rampaging, never-disclipined brat that would be punched in the snoot if they said these things as an adult\" (you see this a lot in TV dramas where the teenage son decides that the apocalyse / invasion / other crisis is a good time to start lashing out at mommy / daddy because I dunno youth is harrrrrd). Lady Mechanika contains such a child. I really hope in a future storyline she gets kidnapped by bird monsters and dropped into the sea. She's awful.* fake \"cockernee\" written by Americans, and \"Victorian\" English peppered with anachronistic phrases. Argh Argh Argh.* lady-badass fights nemesis-lady-badass and their antagonism is fuelled by a long-ago falling out over... A MAN.

She begans to follow their trail, but it runs cold as the last girl appears to be dead from gunshots injuries, and recovering her body only leads to encounters with people from Mechanika's past.Her travels following more information on the mechanical girl puts her on contact with the Circus Romani, made up of a bunch of people who are distrusted because they are different (but who share the same distrust towards others), but who are gonna end to be crucial in helping her in her forthcoming adventures, as she ends up striking some kind of friendship with Sr. Gitano, who turns out to be the father of the deceased mechanical girl, called Seraphina.I love the steampunk flare of this graphic novel, the little girl who wears pants and openly defies Lady Mechanika thinking she is an \"imposter\", the consistency of all the characters, how bad the bad characters are (even if some of them are come forward quite as \"nazies\"), and I think overall this is a very entertaining lecture."}, {"userName": "Jeannette Nikolova", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2574284-jeannette-nikolova", "userReview": "Also available on the WondrousBooks blog.\n*** 3.5, but not enough for 4 ***I enjoyed Lady Mechanika a lot more than I did Wraithborn. Considering my immense disappointment with the latter, I was almost scared to start Lady Mechanika.But as I received both of these, and the 2nd volume of Lady Mechanika, from NetGalley, I had to finish it. I am glad I had this incentive, because ultimately, Lady Mechanika is by far better than Wraithborn.Lady Mechanika is the epitome of steampunk. Everything about it is highly detailed and intricate. If you look at the illustrations, you would notice that there are layers upon layers of art and attention to detail and I can't not admit how impressive that is.The art, in general, was much better here than in Wraithborn. If you remember my review, I was aghast at the depiction of women. They are still very sexual in Lady Mechanika, but it's done a lot more tastefully, to a point where I can agree that this is the wet dream of a classy\u00a0high school boy.I also found the story more intriguing. I enjoyed the main story arc about the mechanical people a lot. The part that didn't impress me as much were the sub-plots and hints at other relations between the character that just add fluff to a story that could go without. Almost all characters are related in pairs and have common past. These two are siblings, those two worked together, the two men know each other, etc. etc. As far as the story about the Frankenstein-esque doctor who creates the mechanical people goes, there's already enough suspense that everything else is just micromanagement of pages that need to be filled.And speaking of, my major issue with Lady Mechanika: the writing. Literally. The author really wanted to write a book, didn't have enough material for that, but he obviously had too much for a comic book. There is just SO MUCH DIALOGUE. It doesn't go harmoniously with graphic novels. A book rat such as myself can tell you as much: when you are reading a book, you can take as many pages of text as there are; but if you are reading a comic book, you are not prepared for the insane amount of dialogue that is just out of place and both disjoints the story, and distracts the reader.Looking at this, I remember what I thought when I was initially reading it: This is honestly outrageous."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2452488-kim", "userReview": "The art work was absolutely beautiful in this graphic novel.

Beautifully illustrated, this collection is sure to create another generation of fans to join the cult following Lady Mechanika already enjoys.She is Lady Mechanika, the lone survivor of a mad scientist's experiments, which left her with mechanical limbs. She has no memory of her former life and finds that she must rebuild a new one for herself. She becomes an adventurer and private investigator, using her strange and new abilities to solve crimes the police are not able to. When the corpse of a young woman with mechanical limbs is found in the very city where she was found, Lady Mechanika may finally have a lead to her very own origin and moves all she can to investigate. Set in an alternative Steampunk Victorian England where magic and inventions clash for their hold on reality. Where beautiful women with mechanical appendages and corsets and steam powered dirigibles fill the skies. this new Lady Mechanika tale tells the story of a young woman's search for her past.Joe Benitez continues the story of Lady Mechanika and with terrific artwork backing up some of the best storytelling going around he has created an independent comic line not to be missed.

It's got adventure. It takes place on a large scale, but doesn't forget the struggles and successes of the characters on a more personal level. My one main complaint - as there often is one - is that (for me) the visuals for the female characters make it clear that there is a male team behind the stylized artwork.

Looking forward to the next volume!Thanks to the publisher and Netgalley for providing me with a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review!"}, {"userName": "Tom\u00e1\u0161", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3215836-tom", "userReview": "Mozek \u0159\u00edk\u00e1 za t\u0159i, o\u010di \u0159\u00edkaj\u00ed za pln\u00fd po\u010det hv\u011bzd.

Having no memory of her captivity or her former life, Lady Mechanika eventually built a new life for herself as an adventurer and private investigator, using her unique abilities to solve cases the proper authorities couldn't or wouldn't handle. But she never stopped searching for the answers to her own past. Set in a fictionalized steampunk Victorian England, a time when magic and superstition clashed with new scientific discoveries and inventions, Lady Mechanika chronicles a young woman's obsessive search for her identity as she investigates other mysteries involving science and the supernatural. This volume collects the entire first Lady Mechanika mini-series The Mystery of the Mechanical Corpse, including its prequel chapter The Demon of Satan's Alley, plus a complete cover art gallery.", "title": "Lady Mechanika, Vol.1: The Mystery of the Mechanical Corpse\n      \n          (Lady Mechanika 0-5)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28116143-lady-mechanika-vol-1", "average": 4.09, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1449489725l/28116143.jpg", "reviews": 184, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/54938.Joe_Ben_tez", "name": "Joe Ben\u00edtez"}], "type": ["Sequential Art", "Sequential Art", "Science Fiction", "Fantasy", "Science Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28116143-lady-mechanika-vol-1", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29599442-lady-mechanika-vol-1", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28414769-lady-mechanika-volume-1", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28260229-lady-mechanika-volume-1", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35561945-lady-mechanika", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9864447-lady-mechanika-0", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9898016-lady-mechanika-1", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12315391-lady-mechanika-2", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29151467-lady-mechanika-vol-2", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13296408-lady-mechanika-3", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19755140-embassytown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32858845-off-to-be-the-wizard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10931746-the-stepford-wives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13604418-the-long-earth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34111309-the-man-of-legends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193375-fellside", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204943-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18806963-prayers-to-broken-stones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18126623-2061", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29425329-alas-babylon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193696-3001", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9409759-powers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38213061-leviathan-wakes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18162904-dreams-and-shadows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35106805-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23249416-an-unwelcome-quest"]}
