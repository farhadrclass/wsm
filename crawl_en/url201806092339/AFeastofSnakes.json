But somehow I expected more. I mean, the premise is fantastic . . . Every year in the little town of Mystic, Georgia (high school football team \"the Rattlers\"), there is a \"Rattler Day,\" which features the crowning of a high school girl as \"Miss Rattler,\" followed by her ritual torching of a huge snake effigy, followed in turn by a pit bull battle. Then, the next day, the real fun: hundreds of snakes are released into the woods and the snake hunt begins . . .  Many of the incidents are shocking, vicious and memorable, but--in spite of its spare style and mere 175 pages--it meanders (like a snake?) until it reaches its violent, inadequately motivated end.

Special thanks to Trail Member Leanne for nominating this work.\n\u201cThat was the only decision there was once upon a time: what to do with the night.\u201d\n\nHarry Crews (June 7, 1935-March 28, 2012)I was introduced to the works of Harry Crews through the anthology Grit Lit: A Rough South Reader, edited by Tom Franklin and Brian Carpenter. Included was the first chapter of A Feast of Snakes. I was hooked. (For my review of Grit Lit, see http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/... , a continuing project) Want to take a trip to the Rough South? Let Harry Crews take you down to Mystic, Georgia, for the annual Rattlesnake Roundup, a dark mixture of booze, sex, football, and violence, in his eighth novel, A Feast of Snakes.\nFirst Edition, Atheneum, New York, 1976Mystic, Georgia, is basically a dot on the map these days, located in Irwin County, with a population of 229. At twenty-one Joe Lon Mackey is a has been. The former Boss Snake of the town's high school Rattlers, a mean football machine, could have played anywhere he wanted except for one thing. He wasn't a good student. Though a star on the grid, and over the hood of head cheerleader Berenice Sweet's Corvette, Joe Lon scored on a regular basis, Joe Lon wasn't accepted to any college.\n\"That's the way they all put it in Mystic: Joe Lon Mackey is not a good student. But it was worse than that and they all knew it. It had never been established exactly if Joe Lon could read. Most of the teachers at Mystic High who had been privileged to have him in their classrooms thought he probably couldn't. But they liked him anyway, even loved him, loved tall, blond, high school All-American Joe Lon Mackey whose exceptional quietness off the playing field everybody chose to call courtesy.\"\nBerenice has moved on to the University of Georgia. Her younger sister Hard Candy is head majorette at the high school and goes with the new Boss Snake Willard Miller. Though three years younger, Willard is Joe Lon's best buddy. It's Joe Lon's link to his glory days.Joe Lon's real life makes him want to howl. He has married Elfie who started out pretty enough, but after he's put two babies in her belly one after the other, Elfie has lost that girlish appeal. Their two boys constantly wail, and Joe Lon had rather be anywhere other than their double wide. Elfie is the target of Joe Lon's constant emotional abuse and, at times, physical.Big Joe Lon was the town bootlegger. Little Joe Lon has been allowed to take over the business. He spends his days selling shine and unlabeled bonded whiskey. The big money comes once a year when the Rattlesnake Roundup rolls around.Joe Lon bought ten acres of land, turning it into a trailer and campsite. The Roundup started out small, but through the years, the word has gotten around. Thousands of snake loving hunters and snake curious tourists descend on Mystic and Joe Lon's camp ground.\nA typical snake pit at a rattlesnake roundupThe Roundup is a macabre gathering of grotesques and freaks, not that the citizens of Mystic are much less so than their visitors. Old Joe Lon trains fighting pit bulls. The training is cruel. His daughter Beeder has sealed herself off in her room, abandoning the real world for a television set.Sheriff Buddy Matlow, a veteran of the Vietnam War, has a peg leg and a sense of entitlement. If a woman doesn't put out, he locks her up on a trumped up charge until she does. Joe Lon's bootlegging operation is off limits. The sheriff drinks for free at the gas station that covers the liquor business. But his predatory sexual practices will exact rough justice when he chooses the wrong woman to mess with and pushes her over the limits of sanity.As the hunters and tourists gather for the roundup, Joe Lon sees his chance for a return to the glory days when Berenice comes home from the University of Georgia. The one problem is she's brought a new boyfriend, Adam Shepherd, who is on the debate team. But one glance at her former Boss Snake is all it takes when Joe Lon orders her to assume a four point stance.\nGot it? Berenice understood perfectly.Crews writes rough as a cob. He's out to shock and he does it. Crews' detractors have accused him of relying on broadly drawn southern stereotypes. But he hasn't. Characterization is Crews' strong point. Throw in perfect pitch dialog and you have a fierce and angry Southern Gothic novel.In structuring \"A Feast of Snakes\" Crews divided the novel into two parts. In the first, Crews has Joe Lon Mackey seeking a nostalgic return to the days of his past fame. In the second, Joe Lon deals with the reality of his present life and contemplates what the future holds.Flannery O'Connor wrote:\n\"When you can assume that your audience holds the same beliefs as you do, you can relax a little and use more normal means of talking to it; when you have to assume that it does not, then you have to make your vision apparent by shock, to the hard of hearing you shout, and for the almost-blind, you draw large and startling figures.\"\nCrews follows O'Connor's formula to perfection. The conclusion to \"A Feast of Snakes\" shocks, shouts, and paints a canvas of hellish violence reminiscent of Hieronymous Bosch. Joe Lon is a monster. However, he is a monster that Crews so artfully portrays, the reader is mesmerized, and perhaps a bit empathetic.\nThe Earthly Delights aren't all they're cracked up to be."}, {"userName": "Brian", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1938805-brian", "userReview": "In one of his essays collected in Blood and Grits Harry Crews explains that there came a time when he was trying to write fiction that he realized, if he was going to be any good at his craft, that he had to stop pretending to be someone he wasn't and start writing about what he knew. Embrace his roots. There was plenty that Crews wished he had never experienced, but he didn't get to pick whether or not he grew up poor in Bacon County, Georgia. Because he decided to be true to his heritage, we readers get the opportunity to get a glimpse into a slice of his hell. Bare-knuckled, uneducated, violent and alcoholic hell. Going nowhere fast.Joe Lon Mackey, the former All-American running back from Mystic, Georgia could be considered the protagonist of the story, but that would be a lie. The real protagonist of this book is Mystic itself - a backwater small town far enough away from Atlanta it may as well be Atlantis. Mystic hosts an annual Rattlesnake Roundup where people come from around the continent to fetch themselves some diamondbacks. This event plays as the backdrop to a host of local yokels, each potentially more fucked up than the next, with Joe Lon as the somewhat central star that calls their orbit. We watch Mackey's deterioration as the narrative unfolds; his withering alcoholism mirrors everyone else that has failed to escape Mystic. The town has a gravitational pull comprised of booze, easy sex and the halcyon recollection of youthful days. It circles its denizens with a pit of snakes, literally and figuratively, and the only hope one has of achieving an escape velocity is education. Crews writes in the third person omniscient about Joe Lon: He wished to God he could escape. But he didn't know where he could go or what he wanted to escape from. Fat, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life, son. But if you must, there's a place for you here in Mystic.I'm not going to pretend that this was easy to read. There is adultery, rape, murder, domestic violence, specific violence, general violence, dog fighting (along with a very, very specific and violent training regimen that makes it clear that Crews was exposed to this horrific event), mayhem. There are no likable characters (out of about a dozen). I was so shocked by the ending of this book I spent the afternoon talking about it with my wife and a friend. But this is how good Crews is, and why - as a reader that seeks the real - I am so happy that he chose years ago to embrace his past. I may be a son of the south, but I never knew Crews' people: Grits. And if he didn't write about the shitty, awful existence of poor, alcoholic, uneducated, racist, violent and seemingly execrable humans - people that didn't choose to be born in that place and time, how would he ever be able to show that it was possible to rise above that scum to do better? Crews is the Doppelg\u00e4nger of Joe Lon. He proves that you can get out, that life is better. And it doesn't have to end the way that this book did."}, {"userName": "Rae Meadows", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3184-rae-meadows", "userReview": "This book is completely bonkers! Harry Crews's southern Gothic tale packs in racism, rape, dog-fighting, madness, suicide, murder, wife-beating, and snakes, snakes, and more snakes. The violence in this novel is everywhere, above and below the surface, a pulse all its own. It's 1975 in rural Mystic, Georgia, and Joe Lon, an illiterate former football star feels the abyss of sadness and meaninglessness open up to engulf all his remaining days, which happens to coincide with the annual Rattlesnake Roundup, an event that brings hundreds of amped up people to town to hunt snakes. There is no one to root for in the book--except briefly when young Lottie Mae exacts revenge on her rapist--and everyone is wretched. The whiskey never stops, and the simmering rage and disappointment of the characters made me want to put the book down only to immediately want to pick it up again.Would I recommend it? No! Or at least not to everyone. But I gave it five stars because it's unlike anything I've ever read, and I think it will stay with me for a long time. It is utterly compelling and devastating. It stressed me out. The frenzy of moral decay is unrelenting. The language, the syntax, I found mesmerizing and it felt true. The crazy end of the book is, of course, as inevitable as it is completely over the top. (It is Gothic after all.) Dark and darker, even in the moments that were meant to be comedic. Read at your own risk."}, {"userName": "LeAnne", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7862560-leanne", "userReview": "Yow! This was a fantastic, brutal, and exceedingly dark comedy. Totally blew me away. That said, most readers probably ought to avoid it unless they can distance themselves as one would with \"Lord of the Flies\" or \"The Orphan Master's Son.\" If you are a fan of Nick Cave's And the Ass Saw the Angel, get a copy of Feast ASAP.The authenticity of poor southern grammar and pronunciation is pure (Im a Louisianan - trust me), but the howling bleakness is like something out of classic Russian literature. You have no idea where the story is ultimately going, but like gawkers at a train wreck, the compulsion to know that destination pulls you along. Bizarre side characters, baton twirling, and a cultish devotion to snakes all adorn this freakish crown of grit lit.Why will most people shy away, then? There is graphic, nasty, but consensual sex. Dog fighting. Constant guzzling of whiskey. Racism. Rape. Dis-memberment. Doglike devotion that will revolt you.But it is amusing in a dark way! When two local studs are challenging a newcomer as he pumps iron outside his camper, they decide to beat the muscle man at his own game (page 85):\"Joe Lon and Willard slipped out of their shirts. Willard flipped over and walked around in the dirt on his hands. Joe Lon took the bottle of whiskey out of his back pocket, set it carefully on the step of the Winnebago, checking out Susan Gender's red pants again as he did. Then he went into a steady handstand and did six dips, his nose just short of the dirt each time he went down. They both came off their hands and looked at Duffy.\"I'm impressed,\" said Duffy, shortly. \"What the hell are you, gymnasts?\"\"Drunks,\" said Joe Lon picking up the bottle.\"Loved this book for its \"what the hell??\" moments and Joe Lon's miserable life. I gave it 5 stars, but most of y'all will hate it. It includes the best suicide note ever composed!"}, {"userName": "Lou", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3699303-lou", "userReview": "Prepare to let Harry Crews take you by the hand in this narrative, to dark places and witness things you would hate to see.Right from the get-go he immerses you. Read the following visceral sentences in this first paragraph..\"She felt the snake between her breasts, felt him there, and loved him there, coiled, the deep tumescent S held rigid, ready to strike. She loved the way the snake looked sewn onto her V-neck letter sweater, his hard diamondback pattern shining in the sun. It was unseasonably hot, almost sixty degrees, for early November in Mystic, Georgia, and she could smell the light musk of her own sweat. She liked the sweat, liked the way it felt, slick as oil, in all the joints of her body, her bones, in the firm sliding muscles, tensed and locked now, ready to spring--to strike--when the band behind her fired up the school song: \"Fight On Deadly Rattlers of Old Mystic High.\" \"He said in an interview on video this...\"The writers job is to get naked!To hide nothing.To look away from nothing.To look at it.To not blink.To be not embarrassed or shamed of it.Strip it down and lets get down to where the blood is, the bone is.Instead of hiding it with clothes and all kinds of other stuff, luxury!\"He has achieved this successfully with this story. He takes you right to the bone of the story no glossy coating; his prettiness is the detail and the showing of his characters that ooze a visceral human ugliness and beauty. The main character in this story Joe Lon is married with two babies and has other partners on the side, he has a had a lot of pain in the past and lives on the edge in the present a snake hunter, snake eater, drinker, a tough guy, power lifter and he's violent most of his life and that's all lived through in this story. He hosts yearly a event of snake hunting on a stretch of land for camping near woods filled with snakes.There is racism in this story and it does feature a black girl who receives abuse from a nasty man. There was to be a day of joy for her, which I was pleased for her. Here she comments in the story of her dilemma.\"White people were dangerous and snakes were dangerous and now the two were working together, each doing what the other told it to. She was sure she had seen a snake in a weeded ditch with the head of a white man. Right after she came out of the house on the way to Big Joe's, which she had immediately forgotten, she saw it, long and black and diamond-patterned in the ditch with a white man's head. It had blue eyes. The bluest eyes any white man ever had. She was sure she had seen it. She thought she had seen it. Maybe it was only a dream or a memory of another time. Whatever it was, she still saw it every time she closed her eyes, coiled there on the back of her eyelids, blue-eyed and dangerous.\"He achieves the task of putting you into dark corners of the rural south into lives of these wild, bizarre and violent characters. He stops you in you tracks and possibly leaves you thinking and pondering on the evil that men do.You will love or hate these characters contained within this novel. I do warn you this story does is hair raising and has some ugly moments of violence. For instance there is a page filled with a scene of dogs fighting to the death as a part of a game during the snake-hunting event. As a dog lover it does shock being there. He does successfully leave a mark and shock with his writing.There is snake eating in this story. I first learnt of snake eating from Donald Ray Pollock's novel Devil all the Time. This story reminds me of characters in that story also Frank Bill's short story collection Crimes in Southern Indiana and possibly recent Last Cll or the Living by Peter Farris.Readers may say his writing this is over the top, he tells it like it is!I am sorry to say but the horrible things contained within DO happen in this beautiful place of ours called Earth. That doesn't make it right but his writing makes us not forget its there.As a writer I think, from watching his interviews, he wanted to stand out and be heard. He\u2019s a writer who wrote with the experience of a lot a pain and challenges in life. He has done it all he has testified himself that there is nothing he has not tried. Been in a swamp with crocodiles, slashed his wrists as part of failed suicide and been 12 times in rehab. His life was plagued with drugs and heavy drinking.With all this in his life he is a talented writer, when he puts pen to paper he sinkers you in to his characters, setting and voice.His writing it seemed to be his therapy everyday he wrote 500 words and if he didn't he felt guilt.A lot of the fuel, the energy for his writing, comes from his pain, he has had very hard and brutal upbringing as a young child suffered from polio he's father died young and mother.He mentions hard times growing up with his brother.A man that lived on the edge right to the brink of danger and comes back and writes stories recognized by many a great works. He was a hard working writer that has gained a large respect amongst readers.Harry Crews will be remembered as a larger than life character, more and more as his work is read and life learned of.Some things in mentioned in an interview about writing. \"The real artist with no tear in his eye and no sadness in his heart, puts the pages in the fire and does it again!\"\"All art is a metaphor it's by telling you one thing when your mean something else.The Old Man in the Sea is not about fishing!\"\"Writing a book is like torture that you don't know, but after it\u2019s done and there it is.

He's just so astonishingly insulting about them. In this mad novel not a page goes by without whiskey or beer or shine being drunk usually by the driver of a motor vehicle which is not stationary. Every ten pages someone you'd sell your left kidney to not have to meet does something unspeakable to a yet more hideous other. I guess if this book has a theme - apart that is from the one-eyed trouser snake theme, the one familiar to us from the Garden of Eden, it's an examination of male rage and male agony. Hard to imagine a more full-tilt macho society than the one depicted here, and hard to imagine more loathsome disgusting men. They rape, they beat women, they breed pit bulls, they kick animals to death, they hardly ever floss, but are they happy? Well, you'da thought so, but it seems the answer is no, they ain't. Harry should concentrate on exploring what happens to these guys when they don't immolate themselves - could be an interesting novel in there - or possibly he just thinks there really is no escaping the impasse of untrammelled machismo. Well, that may be so. Isn't every massacre/suicide from Killeen and San Ysidro to Hungerford and Virginia Tech a living, dying demonstration of this? This is the 2nd Crews novel I've read and in each one he organises a crazy frenzied crowd-goes-raving-mad scene at the end, like a southern gothic version of a gang of peasants burning down Frankenstein's castle. Kind of like throwing us all a big party.So Harry Crews, yeah, he's another novelist I'd walk on the other side of the road to avoid. Finally : One thing Harry does really well, like Pete Dexter, is write dialogue.  \"Say, we done good\" said Lummy. \"Howsomever, it don be whatall I come to axe you bout.\"  Or here's a girl giving advice to her friend who's terrified of snakes: \"Can you shoot a gun?\"\"Can't shoot no gun. Ain't got no gun.\"\"Knife?\"\"Razor.\"\"Don't be without you razor.\"\"I couldn't kill it.\"\"Just in case you can, be handy to you razor.\""}, {"userName": "Anthony Vacca", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27183668-anthony-vacca", "userReview": "When you get right down to it and cut all the bullshit?

I was happy to be finished. But I think that was entirely the point.I haven't read Crews before and I probably wouldn't have if it wasn't this month's book club book. I'm not opposed to Southern gothic lit - Flannery O'Connor is one of my favorite writers, I've mostly enjoyed most of what I've read so far by Daniel Woodrell, and there are others that my sun-stroked mind isn't coming up with right now.There's a grittiness in all these authors that appeals to me, normally. This story, however, takes that grittiness to a whole 'nother level. To this really mean level. This is not a book for the faint-hearted or highly sensitive.I liked the premise - there's a congregation of sorts in a southern Georgia town for the annual rattlesnake hunt. That's not something you read about very often, right? A whole motley crew of folks show up and shit gets real. I mean... shit really gets real. Blood is spilled, and in some rather ingenious ways. (Again, not for the faint-hearted.)It's also a quick read, partly because it's short (less than 200 pages), but also partly because you don't want it to go on for very long because you will lose any hope you might have for the good in humanity. These people are dicks, straight up. These are not people you would want to know, and I'm not sure if these were people Crews knew and liked, or knew and didn't like, or if he considered himself one of them. I don't know enough about him and while I haven't read anything else by him, I'm under the impression most of his fiction is like this.But, whatever, it's a mean, mean story. Mean people doing mean things and being mean to each other. It wasn't a comfortable read. This doesn't make it bad; but it didn't exactly appeal to me either.

I finally just put it down for good at the point in the story where there is a scene of animal cruelty. I didn't see the point of prolonging the agony. My advice is \"don't bother\" (unless you like terrible images that stick with you for longer than you'd wish).

Hates the characters, their slithery morality and unfulfilled aspirations, hates how the emptiness, the vacuum left is filled the coiled hissing forms of snakes and how it gets under the skin and into the stomach and bowels. I acknowledge the power and intensity Harry Crews has at his command, but I do not admire his A Feast of Snakes.Each year in Mystic, Georgia, Jon Lon organizes the Rattlesnake Roundup, a festival that attracts a denizen of unsavory gypsies, thrill-seekers, and drunkards. They arrive in campers and Winnebagos, setup wares, fight dogs, partake in a beauty pageant, and set fire to a thirty-foot-tall snake. So yes, it\u2019s a hillbilly version of the wicker man.\u2018Hillbilly\u2019 is an appropriate term, since the Jon Lon\u2019s plight plays out as hillbilly angst. That\u2019s because Jon Lon cannot find love. Not in his wife, his inamorata, his children, his friends, his family, his job, or his position as organizer of the Roundup. No, Jon Lon only laments for the past and his former glories of high school football star and his old girlfriend. One wonders how Jon Lon expects to find \u201ctrue love\u201d if his definition involves atm, which Crews graphically describes in one of many vile, foul, and cruel sex scenes. So Jon Lon is stuck operating the liquor store once owned by his father and spends most of the day drinking and bitching at his wife. His father isn\u2019t much different except that he bitches at his daughter since his wife killed herself years ago.The whole book is foul and cruel. Foul because Crews revels in shock. Cruel because Crews casts a hateful eye on all his citizens and puts them through the wringer. Even Lottie Mae, the sole redeeming subplot in the entire novel, is brutalized, driven insane, and disturbed by snakes before she is able to exact an even crueler revenge.Lottie Mae, a young black girl, is the object of the sheriff\u2019s desire. The sheriff Buddy is a mangled man, a landlocked hillbilly pirate, I guess, with his peg leg. His real leg he lost in \u2018Nam. Buddy, too, laments the past for he, too, was once a football star. Most of the male characters were. Now he occupies his time by carrying snakes, one in a sack and the other in his pants. Yes, that is a metaphor Crews pounds in your head, over and over. The phallic nature of snakes. The sexual connotation of Eve\u2019s temptation, of the snake in the garden. And on and on.I\u2019m exaggerating somewhat, since the snake metaphor is one of the few things Crews deftly handles, despite the overkill. His similes and his prose, however, are dull, especially in the first half. Let me quote a little gem here describing Jon Lon\u2019s wife: \u201cTwo inches below her navel her belly just leaped out in this absolutely unbelievable way.\u201d Well, that\u2019s absolutely unbelievable! But it gets better: \u201cshe looked like she was carrying a basketball under her dress.\u201d A basketball, no kidding!The dialogue, mostly in dialect, is authentic, though I questioned some of the intentional misspellings. And the prose does get better in the second half, lyrical at times, but he still stumbles over similes. With obvious imaginative powers, why does Crews stumble with similes?Rereading what I wrote, I\u2019m shocked I haven\u2019t mentioned the violence. The book\u2019s back cover notes that Crews covers the vices of \u201cadultery, castration, suicide, and murder.\u201d This list, of course, leaves out bullying, rape, drunkenness, drunken driving, fights, lies, animal brutality including mutilation and dog fighting, racism, sexism, abandonment, kidnapping, battered wives, neglected wives, paraphilia, madness, delusions, feces fascination, religion bashing, and idleness. All of which are ingredients for an instant cult classic!But yes, there is a lot of violence, a lot of touting of masculinity and then more violence. One could posit that Crews argues against masculinity and its corrupting power, which is true. But Crews idealizes athleticism in a well-rendered scene of weight-lifting and dick-measuring, which in the south is how one determines the pecking order. The equivalent of dogs sniffing the other\u2019s rectum.Despite the Southern Gothic nature, it\u2019s rather insulting for readers cite Crews alongside the masters Faulkner and O\u2019Connor. Both incorporated humanity in their works, dealt with underlying problems in the south, and both, in the end, were redemptive, even if at times it was a freak show. Crews, however, is just a freak show. With the exception of Lottie Mae, who\u2019s in so little of the book and so distant from the main thread, A Feast of Snakes has little value, which disappoints me since Crews does have intensity as a writer."}, {"userName": "Kata", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6953743-kata", "userReview": "Sometimes how you come to read a book is intriguing. Perhaps you browse the shelf after shelf, book jacket after book jacket at a book shop. Maybe you read vast literary reviews or reviews by your contemporaries who have similar book tastes. On rare occasions, I find a book just happens to fall into my possession out of thin air I cannot for the life of me recall how I came to own it. But the very best way to acquire a book, I believe, is when an acquaintance who truly knows your literary taste says to you, \"You must read this.\" This is how I came to read \"A Feast of Snakes.\" My boyfriend, John who knows my literary palate and bookshelves (sometimes better than me) recommended this book. We were on a shopping spree in one of thee best second-hand book stores in all of Florida when he handed me this book. He explained that Harry Crews was a well known Floridian author and then sealed the deal by saying, \"You will enjoy this.\"John was right. Crews immerses the reader into the deep south of Mystic, Georgia where the local dialect is much different than what I am accustomed to. If I can muster a complaint about this book it is that I had to take my time wrapping my Yankee brain and tongue around sentences like, \"Hit tetched me all the living while.\" But that is just a small hurdle for this Yankee reader because what pulled me in nose first into this book was the raw rough edges of the characters' lives. Okay, I'll be honest there was one other part of the book where I shook my little Yankee head. Okay, I'll tell you and you can judge me viciously! Two adult females had a baton twirling contest outside and I had a hard time imagining baton twirling in my backyard. The main character, Joe Lon Mackey was the epitome of an alpha-male when he was in high school and during the first few opening pages you feel how far down he has fallen. You are pulled with him into the gravitational disgust of his dismal life: an unhappy marriage, unwanted children, a drunken father who abuses dogs, a psychologically disturbed sister and his lethargic job running the local tavern. A man who once felt on top of the world has fallen into the gloom of reality in Mystic. I don't want to mislead you, this is not a book which revolves around one person. There is a small cast of characters which Crews does a great job weaving into dark places as well, some characters into darker places than Joe Lon even experiences.Crews pivots each character around Mystic's annual snake festival. Imagine a small town filled with an influx of people, snakes and drunken festivities. A town already filled with darkness and then amplifying it to its greatest extent. This composite of tourists and the snake festival itself are more than enough to make the book severe but it is the local residents which draw Crews to write with a undeniable rough edge comparable to that of Cormac McCarthy.The darkness in Mystic becomes a common thing and the characters think nothing of the gloom in their lives or in the lives of others. It is a gloom they accept and attempt to forget. In one sentence, a man (Lummy) over hears Joe Lon screaming at his father over the telephone. Crews writes elegantly \"But Lummy might as well have been hearing a woodpecker in a tree or rain on a tin roof. It was the natural sound of the world, too much like everything else, and he wouldn't remember it.\"I may not have the rural southern dialect mastered, but I clearly understood the battle against darkness, gloom and utter despair which unraveled in this book. More than that, I love reading a book that is dark and elegant all at once. But most importantly it was recommended to me by someone who knew I would enjoy the darkness, the elegant sentences and then contemplate the sociological composition of the book. Not only does a reader enjoy a book, they cherish how they acquired the book."}, {"userName": "Josh", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10773168-josh", "userReview": "Three audiences I will address:1) If you're familiar with this title, and know what you're getting into........go for it; it's a ruckus ride- pretty much what you expect it'll be based on what you know is coming.

The local sheriff is a one-legged, hard drinking, ex-local football star who locks up any woman he fancies until they \u201cput out.\u201d Joe Lon, another character was a former football star resentful of his girlfriend Berenice, former Miss Mystic Rattle beauty champ, who had the temerity to go off to college where she became enamored of a \"debate player\" leaving Joe stuck with his wife Elfie, whose body has gone to hell after two children, messed up her teeth and can't keep the kids quiet. Elfie\u2019s sister, Beeder, meanwhile is descending into her own private hell, lying in bed doing nothing but watching \u201cthe TeeVee\u201d at loud volume and smearing feces in her hair after seeing her mother commit suicide rather than stay with her abusive father.  Lottie Mae, a young black girl, helps out Joe's sister sometimes by cooking for them. She likes watching the TeeVee with Beeder, especially during the NBC Nightly News that was so much better than detective stories and soap operas where you had to \"put up with a lot of talking and fooling around before you got to the good parts.\" The news \"went right to the robbing and killing, the crying and the blood, burning buildings and mashed cars. Them NBC Nightly News sumbitches was mean. Soon kill you as look at you. Killed somebody every night. Sometimes drowned whole towns in the ocean. Or made babies grow together at the shoulder.\" Followed by a Ford commercial, \"The closer you look, the better we look!\" Joe was beloved by the whole town and his exceptional quietness off the field \"everybody chose to call courtesy. He had the name of being the most courteous boy in all of Lebeau County, although it was commonly known that he had done several pretty bad things, one of which was taking a traveling salesman out to July Creek and drowning him while nearly the entire first string watched from high up on the bank where they were sipping beer.\"  Joe's only future seems to be selling illegal liquor. Everything is closing in on him as he begins to feel like in a barrel of snakes, \"a writhing of the darkness, an incessant boiling of something thick and slow-moving.\" Joe's father is an intensely cruel and savage man who runs his pit bulls to exhaustion to prepare them for the dog fights the night of the snake hunt. Joe knows that things have become a little crazy, as more and more people crowd into the campgrounds, overflowing the portapotties, and an undercurrent of violence begins to pervade the area. \"Just a bunch of crazy people cranking up to git crazier,\" he says. \"But that's all right. Feel on the edge of doing something outstanding myself.\" He does indeed go over the edge, and the sheriff gets his comeuppance in a spectacularly appropriate manner by Lottie Mae, one of the sheriff's victims who faces her fear of his snake in her own way. Crews portrays a dark side of the South, filled with grotesque characters and bizarre places, incest, adultery, and murder. One wonders how people could descend to such depths. Personally, I think it's the influence of country western music."}, {"userName": "Cody", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48027559-cody", "userReview": "Here\u2019s where it all comes together: the dense religiosity; the vituperative male hostility and dogmatic racism; the freakish impulse to kiss Death\u2019s purpled lips rubbing clavicles with POV\u2019s that switch with the precision and rhythmic grace of rail tracks. The critics and readers alike are entirely correct in considering A Feast of Snakes Crews\u2019 best. From an objectivist\u2019s standpoint, there\u2019s no contest. While it is not my favorite\u2014that would still be the hyper-naturalist masterpiece The Hawk is Dying\u2014I readily cede that it is his crowning achievement, the summation of a career in that it brings together all of his many strengths between two convenient covers. As this is also his most popular book, there\u2019s also no need to add all that much. If you are one-stop shopping for Crews, look no further\u2014this has it all. The fact that Harry was able to pull it off (hey, maybe taking that year off was a good idea!) is astounding, as virtually all of his trademarks are accounted for. For fans of his freaks, your box is ticked (though, thankfully, subdued). For you deep Southern Goth hillbilly bats, your check has been cashed. Lover of the patented Crews switcheroo ending that no one sees coming and leaves you gobsmacked? Your ardor is returned tenfold with spangled kisses on your brow. Read this from the opening of Part Two, and bear witness to the particular genius of Crews atop his own private Idaho: \u201cDuffy Deeter in an effort of will was thinking of Treblinka. He had already finished with Dachau and Auschwitz. Images of death pumped in his head. Behind his pinched burning eyelids he saw a pile of frozen eyeglasses where they had been torn from the faces of long lines of men, women, and children before they had been led into the gassy showers. \u201cDaddy. Please, daddy, come. I love \u2026 love \u2026 But it hurts.\u201d Duffy allowed his eyes to slide open. He permitted himself one glance through the window of his modified Winnebago. Children raced over the dusting landscape with snakes wrapped about their arms. Directly across the road an old man with twists of gray hair screwed into his head waved his hands wildly at two heavily muscled young men who alternately hustled their balls and spat in the dirt. Duffy\u2019s gaze remained on the two young men for a long moment and then he clamped his eyes shut again. Oh Jesus Oh God. Think about those showerheads and the wonderful gas spewing out into the children. Think about the stunned and naked mothers and their gassed dying children. Duffy felt her writhe beneath him as she whispered: \u201cYou\u2019re killing me.\u201d Yes, and by God he would. He\u2019d kill.

To take the edge off his sense of failure he\u2019s turned to the bottle and still tries to maintain his top-dog status in the area.He has a hard-nosed father (Big Joe Lon) who has a talent for dog-fighting, a damaged sister who stays in bed all day watching TV, a sheriff friend who likes to play with young girls, a saintly wife and two children and a hot lust for an ex-girlfriend who has returned to Mystic from college.The opening at a football game is full of energy \u2013 sexual, violent and disturbing \u2013 and pregnant with the bizarre. It\u2019s clear from the off that this book is going to be out of the ordinary and that understanding is powerfully underlined as it continues.There are some very strong elements that a reader can hold on to. There\u2019s the subtle depiction of racial relations and the way people work within the boundaries of time and place. There\u2019s an existential slant to the examination of purpose and the implications of losing direction whether that be through age or accident. There\u2019s a view of the power within relationships on a small and larger scale and that damage that can be done when power is the only tool one has in the box. There are thoughts on madness and the thin ice that we all tread upon. We also get to see the extremes of complete control and absolute anarchy and the dangers of each extreme.The plot is a gently meandering one is some ways. I read the book slowly even though there was a page-turning element to the writing that might have had me jumping on to find out what was about to happen. Taking my time seemed important as there\u2019s so much to savour. In tone the words and the dialogue seem simple, yet there\u2019s a wonderful subtlety to it all that means it might be better not to miss the gems on each page by rushing.I was really struck by the parallels between the old dogs coming to the end of their fighting lives and Joe Lon. They\u2019ve all been bullied by Big Joe in ways that no creature should be. It might be that Big Joe feels this is the right thing to do, but his clarity is hugely misguided. The fates of the dogs and the son are sealed and have been for a long time; it\u2019s a shame none of them had other strings to their bows.The dog fighting and training scenes are fully developed and hard-hitting. They\u2019re gritty as they could be. I\u2019m pleased I only read this after writing \u2018Smoke\u2019 otherwise I may not have felt up to the job.There are also a couple of scenes and situations of bullying that are so profound as to be hugely disturbing. What Crews does here is rather special. Instead of laying the violence and the harshness of the acts of cruelty bare with no supporting frame, he manages to bring out a huge empathy with the victims. Whether it\u2019s Lottie Mae suffering under the sheriff\u2019s weight or Joe\u2019s wife putting up with the most humiliating treatment or the retired salesmen who runs into the wrong people at the wrong time, they\u2019re all flinchingly well-written.The book really struts to its conclusion and feels like it has put on many pounds of muscle along the way. By the end it has the strength of a powerful beast and, like Goliath, there\u2019s only one way for the beast to go.There\u2019s a line early on from cheerleader Hard Candy as she feeds a rat to a snake that puts me in mind of what Crews can do to a reader: \u2018Nobody\u2019s going to hurt you, little rat. We just gone let the snake kill you a little.\u2019 Be warned.This was my second read of a Harry Crews story. The first time around, I really didn\u2019t manage to get beyond the beauty of some of the prose. A Feast Of Snakes is something else altogether and now, at last, I can see why the author is so widely hailed as a talent and a huge influence upon more contemporary writing."}, {"userName": "Ed", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1077703-ed", "userReview": "For my money, the best fiction from Mr. Crews published during the Bicentennial hoopla.

He makes Harrison read like a society page columnist in comparison. Actually a better comparison might be Albert Camus. Seriously. I think if Camus had been born in Mystic, Georgia, he might've written this book instead of The Stranger.A similar existential abyss sits at the center of Crews's novel, an abyss as mean and violent and frightening as the snake pits and dog-fight pits covering the landscape.Just as it's almost impossible to embrace Meursault, it's impossible to like Joe Lon, a raging, wife-beating-cheating drunk. But such is Crews' talent that you come to understand, even sympathize, with Joe Lon (understanding and sympathy occupying rooms at opposite ends of the house from liking, of course). Mind you, Crews crosses the line (wherever you place it, he crosses it) in a defiant fashion that almost dares you to toss the book out the window. The quality of Crews' prose was the only thing that kept me hurdling the first few lines -- hell, ditches, trenches, moats, swollen rivers -- he crossed. The man can write. And tell a story. There's something deeper going on here than simple, mindless redneck preening and rage. And while the ending is way over the top -- think of Grand Canyon-wide line -- it is also has a surprising element of ambiguity and subtlety, a final image that is both disquieting and generous. In fact, if you were to pitch Crews as Southern Gothic writer, in his own strange way, I find him more subtle than Flannery O'Connor, who I find increasingly mechanical, even a touch didactic, upon rereading.Whether you love or hate this book, by the end you will probably feel like, in the words of Coach Tump, a \"tainted sumbitch.\" And that ain't necessarily a bad thing."}], "description": "From the acclaimed author of such novels as \"Blood and Grits\" and \"Childhood\" comes a wildly weird and breathtakingly original visit to the rural South that reveals the exotic subculture that erupts in all its glory at the Rattlesnake Roundup in Mystic, Georgia. \"No number of adjectives in the thesaurus can do full justice to the dazzlingly bizarre nature of Crews' creations\".--\"Washington Post Book World\". 192 pp.", "title": "A Feast of Snakes", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1897814.A_Feast_of_Snakes", "average": 4.01, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1364644613l/1897814.jpg", "reviews": 334, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13996.Harry_Crews", "name": "Harry Crews"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Gothic", "American", "Horror", "Novels"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1897814.A_Feast_of_Snakes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24847.A_Feast_of_Snakes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/460964.A_Feast_Of_Snakes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24849.A_Childhood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24844.Classic_Crews", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24848.Body", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28313.The_Knockout_Artist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24850.Scar_Lover", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
