She was SO DRAMATIC and her Zachary was just over the top. The rest of my review stands. 2011- Let me say first that it's a wonderful book. The characters are people you care about, and get very involved with. The plot is fun. The writing is excellent. However, I think it is dated, no matter what Wendy says to the contrary. The attitudes of the menfolk, first of all- Daddy makes all the calls, takes the women and children out of danger, and dictates what his wife may not wear (pants, natch). John, the priggish elder brother, follows Daddy's lead here. The overarching worry about nuclear war with the Soviets dates it. The wondering if humans will ever fly to the moon dates it. The painful slang- including \"hoods\" and \"beatniks\". Even the logging trucks with one log per load make it read as dated. And who calls their father 'Daddy' un-ironically when they are 14? Or like John, 17? Why do I find this particular book dated in a fashion I don't notice with, say, the Betsy-Tacy books? Probably because it feels like L'Engle is attempting to comfort the people who were genuinely Vicky's age when this book came out. There's an undercurrent of very pointed reassurance that seems to be grounded in time, and I think that's what makes parts of this book a little stale. I think that had I been reading this as a young teen in 1963 I would have clung to it like grim death. I read it as a young teen in the mid-70's and thought the slang very silly at the time. But it didn't stop me loving the book.In addition to the things I'm complaining about, there's a timeless story here too, wherein a young girl tries to make sense out of the senseless, to grasp the meaning, if any, of her life at the same time she's beginning to pull away from her family of origin and find her own path. Here is the place in which L'Engle shines like the sun. Her essential, unshakable conviction that there IS a reason for everything, that there IS a hand at the wheel, and that the driving force of that hand is the power of love, infuses every word. And makes all my bitching about beatniks sound as small as it is.It's a wonderful book. I love that it's anchored at both ends with Grandfather. I'll always love Grandfather for giving me Henry Vaughan, but as Kipling said, that is another story."}, {"userName": "NebraskaIcebergs", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2376750-nebraskaicebergs", "userReview": "I discovered The Moon by Night in a high school library. After devouring it, I was hooked on Madeleine L\u2019Engle. I love all the introspective passages from Vicky\u2019s viewpoint. Her thoughts hook me from the very first page: \u201cIndoors there was excitement and confusion and I guess a lot of happiness. I was the only one who seemed to be unhappy because nothing would ever be the same again. Up to a few days ago my life had been all of a piece, exciting sometimes and even miserable, but always following the same and simple pattern or home and school and family.\u201d From this point onward, Vicky faces the confusion of change starting with the decision of her parents to move the family to New York. Then there\u2019s the fact that her Uncle Douglas and Elena have gotten married. There\u2019s also the fact that Maggy, who by the point has lived with the family for two years, will now move in with Uncle Douglas and Elena. To cushion all these changes, the Austin parents decide to take the family on a camping trip to California to visit the newlyweds. Along the way, however, Vicky encounters even more changes, starting with the car that sped through their campgrounds. As the car passed \u201csomething was flung out of the window and shattered against the side of our station wagon with a sound like an explosion.\u201d This event leads to showdown with a gang, along with questions about stereotypes: Should the Austins be frightened by teenagers? Or should they resent Tennessee, the state in which this gang appeared? With the introduction of these questions, Madeleine L\u2019Engle sets the stage for the arrival of troubled boy Zachary Gray. Through him, Vicky is forced to deal with the reality of evil and therefore questions about God\u2019s part in it. Being a teenager facing my own first doubts when I first read this book, I found great comfort in Vicky\u2019s conversation with her Uncle Douglas about faith. Since then, I have spent much time sorting through my questions about God. Oh, and I have also thought a lot about the nature of love, a topic that is naturally a large part of books for young adults. Yet I don\u2019t know if anyone ever truly has all the answers about faith and love. For that reason, even as an adult, The Moon by Night still resonates with me."}, {"userName": "Kathryn", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4181111-kathryn", "userReview": "The Moon by Night is the second Austin family book. This one, like the first, is told from Vicky's point of view and focuses on her experience of growing up.In The Moon by Night, Vicky and her family are traveling across the United States on a camping vacation as a sort of last hurrah before they have to spend a year or two in New York for her father's research. A lot is changing in their lives; not only are they leaving New England for that time, they're also giving up their foster sister Maggy to their Uncle Douglas, who is marrying their mother's friend. While Vicky is happy for Douglas, Elena, and Maggy, it's still a change for her, and she's at the age where changes are difficult. She's also beginning to wrestle with her faith and the problem of evil.And then...*sigh* enter Zachary Gray.I'm not the only one who TOTALLY HATES Zachary Gray, am I? Vicky keeps telling us there's something special in him, but I don't see it. Not here, sure as hell not in Ring of Endless Light, and not in A House Like a Lotus and not in An Acceptable Time. All I see is a seriously messed-up kid, who certainly has good reason to be messed up but who is still MESSED UP. He keeps promising reform but NEVER DELIVERS. He's an abuser, and he wants Vicky - and later, Poly - to be his enabler.I wonder who Zachary Gray was to Madeleine L'Engle, and if it hurt her to see readers misunderstand him the way it hurts Vicky to see her family misunderstand him. Not that *I* think I'm misunderstanding Zachary, mind you. I think I understand him just fine, and what I understand is that he is POISON and Vicky needs to steer clear of him and Poly could do SO MUCH BETTER.So anyway, I would probably give The Moon by Night another star if it weren't for Zachary Gray. I pure hate that guy."}, {"userName": "Wendy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1182381-wendy", "userReview": "Growing up, L'Engle was one of my favorite authors, and I read pretty much any book I could find by her. Some became all-time favorites. Some I would not recommend or want to read again. This is one of the latter.Since I have a real soft spot for A Ring of Endless Light (a later book in the same Austin family series) I thought I would revisit this one. I had read it so long ago that I had forgotten much of it, except that it involved a cross-country camping trip and the introduction of Zachary Grey. Promising enough, right?Why, then, is it so disappointing? Partly because of how ordinary it is. I really missed the fantastical sci-fi elements of other L'Engle books. The book also feels dated with its references to specific 60's happenings. While these are used to illuminate more timeless, universal issues and questions, they are a bit jarring nonetheless.I also had issues with the characters. I understand that Vicky is younger and trying to find herself still. But I wasn't quite rooting for her here. Zachary, too, was a disappointment. He's a troubled kid, for sure, but in other novels he seems more likable to me despite his flaws. I did like the uncle and Andy (whatever happened to them in later books?)The message/moralizing here is a bit over the top, too. L'Engle has a definite point of view always, and I don't always have to agree with her conclusions, but I like when they are expressed a bit more subtly.Bottom line: Skip this one and read A Ring of Endless Light instead."}, {"userName": "Apryl Anderson", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5895568-apryl-anderson", "userReview": "There's really no better way to pass a quiet Sunday afternoon in the hammock (or fireside couch) than with a L'Engle story.'The moon by night' was charming, delightful, enjoyable but not dull from lack of heart-stopping action. It was even kind of eerie and uncanny to experience Vicky's 14yr old view of the American cross-country vacation. I regret that I tried so hard to be a muffin at that age--read the book, you'll understand--that I overlooked what was right before my eyes. This is the grace that L'Engle's writing provides: she assumes that her readers are intelligent, caring people of all ages. Her books are living water in a dry and dusty land!"}, {"userName": "Judy", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3333943-judy", "userReview": "I love Madeleine L'Engle's books. Aside from A Wrinkle In Time, she has written many other novels, some for adults and some for young adults. The Austin Family Chronicles would be shelved as Young Adult I suppose.I am not generally a reader of what I call \"comfort fiction\" but there are a handful of authors who write in a way that comforts me and L'Engle is one of them.The Austin family was first introduced in Meet The Austins. They are portrayed as a variation on the ideal American family who live in a rural Connecticut town. The time is contemporary for the year the book was published (1960) and they are a tight knit bunch with wise and loving parents.In The Moon By Night, Vicky Austin is again the narrator. She is now 14, the second of four kids in the family. At this time she is going through the pangs of adolescence, those first stirrings of private thoughts and longings, mostly about boys. She tries to guard this closely in her mind and heart while suffering the inability to fully share with her parents and her adored older brother. Oh, I remember those feelings from when I was 14! Because this volume was published in 1963 when I was 15 going on 16, I felt a special affinity for Vicky. That year was possibly the last year of white middle class American life before the country exploded into a chaos of change.The Austin family is about to explode into change as well. Dr Austin has accepted a job in New York City so they will move in the fall from their idyllic home to life in the city. Vicky will be forced to leave her friends and the only lifestyle she has ever known and go to a new school, make new friends and experience urban life for the first time.The parents have decided the whole family will take an extended vacation for the summer, a camping trip across the United States to California and back. The kids are rather appalled at this idea, each for different reasons, but the parents rule. So off they go with their station wagon, tents, and portable stove.Thus the backdrop for Vicky's first summer as a teen is a road trip and the reader gets to experience National and State Parks with all the various climates, topography, and varieties of people to be found in our vast country. Vicky meets two boys over the course of their travels and must decide on her own, but with intrusive barrages of advice from her parents and siblings, how to understand and love these two very different examples of male creatures who are not family members.L'Engle manages to sidestep excessive sentimentality, to show examples of good parenting and conjure the feelings of adolescent sexual awakening. Yes, it is rather tame and the escapes from danger a bit unbelievable at times, but I was never bored. I think the author was creating in this series the traditional family she wished she'd had. Since I had something close to that when I was growing up, as well as road trips every summer, I felt right at home. I shared Vicky's exasperation; that feeling that your parents will never understand who your really are along with the hope that they will."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1006779-karen", "userReview": "Re-reading some books by a favorite author.

Maybe it's just that my relationship to adolescent coming of age stories has changed now that I'm no longer 13. I still really like a lot of what L'Engle does, particularly the little details. She still got me in the end; there were just few little things that stuck out along the way that I found vaguely irritating(like apparently Mr. Austin doesn't like women in pants). I really enjoy the Greek professors and Andy (though I remember that part of the book being a lot longer). John and Vicky's relationship continues to be one of my favourite things, though I can't help be struck by how exceptional all of the Austins are. Which I didn't notice as much when I was reading these books when I was younger.I did like how Vicki's skepticism (sort of) re: religion is handled and her broodiness.

While there are elements that are timeless and which remain relevant, this book is now also fascinating as a historical study - a family vacation across the United States at a point when culture was just changing and how a somewhat traditional (although unusual, even then) family reacts to situations. The first-person perspective of the teenager works, even though the author was in her forties. There are plenty of issues that have not been resolved in the subsequent decades and L'Engle's beliefs ought to be considered when addressing these.

Yes, that\u2019s the point of the story, but why is the idea of people celebrating Hanukkah such a novel concept, and the idea of other countries not liking America so surprising?? Again, I did not live in the \u201860s, I don\u2019t know what it was like, but seems weird to read from a modern viewpoint \u2022my favorite part of the book is the discussion Vicky has with her Uncle halfway through the book, in California. It\u2019s so nice for Vicky to have a relative who actually somewhat understands her\u2022another favorite part would have to be when Suzy offhandedly mentions a tesseract and Vicky is like, \u201cit would be nice if we could have, like Meg and Charles Wallace Murry, but that\u2019s another story.\u201d It\u2019s so infuriating but also so funny that they treat the Murry\u2019s as fictional characters but just two books later Vicky will fall in love with a boy who worked for them :-) \u2022[I\u2019ve tried and failed to figure out the timeline of the entirety of the L\u2019Engle books so many times and it\u2019s so impossible, I think L\u2019Engle just honestly didn\u2019t care???] \u2022\u201dcomparisons are odious\u201d was one of my fav parts of the book too\u2022let the record show that I hate Zachary Gray with a burning passion and I wish he wasn\u2019t in this book OR A Ring of Endless Light, OR that he wouldn\u2019t bother Polly in her two books, either, but alas... would rather have had Vicky just deal with Andy but then maybe she wouldn\u2019t have fallen for Adam in AROEL so maybe this plot line isn\u2019t too bad \u2022Zachary says that Suzy, Vicky's 11-year-old sister, has sex appeal whereas Vicky does not. a few problems with this. #1: if a 17-year-old guy said this to me about my 11-year-old cousin I'd punch him, probably. why in the world is this okay??? #2: why does every single damn person in this book keep saying that Vicky isn't special, isn't pretty, is too moody, etc, and then two guys fall hard for her?? Vicky just doesn't understand how appealing she probably is to guys\u2022but ultimately, Vicky is a very sweet character and very relatable. her struggles to understand the world are things i've gone through, too. when i read this book as a 17-year-old, it felt like L'Engle was speaking right through the pages and straight to me and me alone\u2022\u201cit was all fascinating, if not violently exciting.\u201d -Vicky talking about redwoods, a lumber mill, and a canned tuna factory (oh Vicky why ya gotta be so EXTRA)\u2022\"I hate religious PHONIES, they're so PHONY\" lol gotta love the influence of Holden Caulfield on Zachary Gray :-)\u2022and then the book ends with, \u201cAnd that\u2019s about all that happened that summer.\u201d Like omfg Vicky did you want MORE to happen???? \u2022and finally, I now want to go on a cross country camping trip \u2022next up, The Young Unicorns, aka The One Where They Move to NYC !!!"}, {"userName": "Gregory Strong", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25861763-gregory-strong", "userReview": "I am reading through a number of books by Madeleine L'Engle. I started with a re-reading of the Time series: \"A Wrinkle in Time\" through \"An Acceptable Time.\" Most enjoyable! Then I decided to try a non-fantasy or non-science fiction series by L'Engle, beginning with \"Meet the Austins\" and then this book, \"The Moon by Night.\" I had not read the Austins series before. The books are targeted toward teenage readers (and that's a wide range of educational and maturation levels), but I am enjoying them. This is partly because L'Engle gives the \"voice\" of the narrator of the two books (Vicky Austin) just enough of an adult-looking-back perspective, and it is partly because L'Engle weaves ordinary family life currents with key dramatic family life moments in an artful and moving way, at least for me. I have always found appealing those works of literature for children and young people which explore daily life at the same time they convey and cast a larger vision for life for the reader. As an adult (and now of a decidedly senior demographic!), these elements in literature still deeply appeal. All this being said, I have found the two books on the Austins entertaining, from the mundane to the humorous to the serious to the poignant. To contemporary young people the books may seem old-fashioned in some ways, given when they were written, yet their human qualities persist. If you are younger or older, and you have any interest, I recommend these books. And taking my own recommendation, I now am going to start the third in the Austins series, \"The Young Unicorns.\""}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6812165-rachel", "userReview": "This book was a tween favorite of mine. (I\u2019d have given it 5 stars then.) It\u2019s beat-up from all the times I've read it. It\u2019s been 30ish years since I last read it though, and I don\u2019t really know why I pulled it off the shelf, but I\u2019m glad I did. It\u2019s a story about growing up, about seeing the world beyond the safety of your family, and about trying to shift from a child\u2019s understanding of God to a more mature understanding of faith in the context of pain and injustice. The cover of my version is obviously late 70\u2019s (released in 1981), and that was misleading. When I read it when I was young, I picked up on some of the out-dated speech, but didn\u2019t think much about when it took place. In many ways, it felt contemporary, probably because I related to Vicky so much. This time though, I really registered the two historical events that set this book in 1959 (Queen Elizabeth\u2019s tour of Canada and the Yellowstone Earthquake). So, note to people designing/choosing covers for future editions: if you\u2019re using an illustration of the main characters, please, please, please, set them in their time. Although the theme is timeless (as they say), this is a period piece. And as it is a period piece, be prepared for some unconscious white privilege.

Vicky, who was then twelve, is now fourteen, and experiencing the typical doubts and growing pains associated with adolescence. In addition to her personal changes, she\u2019s also forced to confront some serious family upheaval. Uncle Douglas has, as predicted by the family in Meet the Austins, married Aunt Elena, and Maggy, the orphaned girl who has been staying with the Austins will now move in with Elena and Douglas, who are her legal guardians. The rest of the Austins will move as well, from Thornhill, their childhood home, to New York City, where Mr. Austin has found work as a doctor. Before heading for the city, however, they take a road trip to Laguna Beach, California, where Douglas, Elena, and Maggy will make their new lives. On the way, the Austins visit well-known attractions like the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone, make the acquaintance of a snide and sickly young man named Zachary Gray who does his best to woo Vicky, and share in surprising adventures involving everything from bears to flash floods. Vicky also makes her own internal, spiritual journey, as she begins to come of age.Back in the Fall, when I reviewed Back When You Were Easier to Love, I wrote, \u201cThe right book is the one that just fits. It clicks with [the] reader in a way that makes her feel as if the book was written specifically for her. \u201c I haven\u2019t felt that way about a book in a while, but I definitely did have that feeling while reading The Moon By Night. I really identified with Vicky\u2019s journey and felt that many of her internal and emotional experiences mirrored my own. In fact, while the road trip is of course an interesting storytelling vehicle, I think the emotional journey was the more compelling aspect of this book. I like, for example, the way Vicky characterizes her need for time away from her family: It was about time for me to be alone for a while. On a camping trip you\u2019re falling over each other twenty-four hours a day. Most of the time it\u2019s fine, but every so often you need to get out. You have to go off by yourself or you just stop being you, and after all I was just beginning to be me. Sometimes, like that evening at Palo Duro with the scouts yelling back and forth as if they owned the place and nobody else had a right to be there, I felt that doing nothing but be with the family was making me muffiny, though we\u2019re not a muffiny family. So that\u2019s not really what I mean. I guess what I mean is, I felt they were sort of holding me back, keeping me from growing up and being myself. (p. 70)The reference to \u201cmuffins\u201d comes from the Anti-Muffins chapter in Meet The Austins, but is also briefly explained in this book - probably due to the fact that \"The Anti-Muffins\" was removed from the original text and replaced later on. I love L\u2019Engle\u2019s understanding that a teenager can love her family and still want to be apart from them, and I loved the philosophical nature of the idea that \u201cyou just stop being you\u201d in the presence of others. I can recall having feelings such as these at the age of fourteen, but I never had words for them until now. I also really like the way the road trip provides opportunities for the Austin family to see how the outside world looks at them, and how they differ from families and groups in the rest of the country, and even outside of their country. Zachary, for whom all the Austins except Vicky feel little affection, is the most threatening example of this, because he embodies a fatalistic outlook that the Austins have never really considered or encountered. Other characters pose similar puzzles, though - especially the \u201choods\u201d who harass the Austins at one of their first campsites and some Canadians they meet who have decidedly negative opinions of American tourists. As with the two L\u2019Engle titles I\u2019ve already reviewed, this one, too, has a spiritual side. The title of the book comes from Psalm 121, in which Vicky finds great comfort: The Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand.The sun shall not smite thee by dayNor the moon by night. The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil; He shall preserve thy soul. The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore. Vicky also has an important conversation with Douglas about her doubts about the existence of God, which touches on the questions all faithful Christians face - mainly, how we are to believe in God when there is no definitive proof of his existence. Speaking to this conundrum, Douglas makes some of the most significant comments of the entire book, at least as far as Vicky\u2019s religious life is concerned. He says that \u201cPeople should never try to make God in man\u2019s image,\u201d and that \u201cwithout [God] we\u2019re just a skin disease on the face of the Earth.\u201d He encourages Vicky to believe despite her lack of understanding and ultimately plants the seed that allows Vicky to realize the sentiment expressed in my single favorite line from the book: The point was that now I knew it didn\u2019t matter whether or not I understood. It didn\u2019t matter because even if I didn\u2019t understand, there was something there to be understood.There are some things about this book that unquestioningly date it to the 1960s - the concern over impending war, Mr. Austin\u2019s dislike of women wearing pants, the fact that Grace Kelly is still alive - but the themes are as relevant to fourteen-year-olds - and to adults, too - now as they ever were. This review, though already on the lengthy side, really only scratches the surface of what this book has to offer; I have no doubt that future re-readings will shed light on layers and connections that didn\u2019t surface for me in this first reading. I very highly recommend The Moon By Night, especially to people of religious faith. It\u2019s also a great summer vacation story, and the perfect book for quirky kids who often find themselves on the margins, even of their own families."}, {"userName": "Catricia", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33963664-catricia", "userReview": "Surprisingly relevant to today, despite the fact that it takes place during the summer of 1959 (the book doesn't explicitly give a year, but I'm going by the earthquake that takes place in the book). Yeah, there's things different, like a lack of technology - which isn't too obvious, since \"roughing it\" even today has little technology use - and the way people interact with each other (Vicky's boyfriends are a little too possessive of her for my comfort). But as Vicky says her mother says Shakespeare says, etc., \"comparisons are odious.\" And there is so much more that has parallels in today's world.Also, yes, this is a book about a teenage girl as she grows up and discovers her place in this world, but I'm a 30-year-old woman and I found plenty to identify with.It would be cool to retrace the journey the Austins took across North America."}, {"userName": "Tina Wilson", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19984694-tina-wilson", "userReview": "Picked this one up because it is about the Austin's as they spend a summer camping and we were going camping so it seemed appropriate. Also, wanted to reread to see at what age/stage to share this one with Brooke. She's still got a few years to go (15ish?). Definitely keep this (and other's in the series) to read together, although she could read alone as well. Just so much good stuff in here to open up conversations about life and God and boys and the confusion of the teenage years. I so love L'Engle..."}, {"userName": "Lorelei Jaramillo", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21981297-lorelei-jaramillo", "userReview": "Love seeing the character development; however, it's hard to grasp that a 14 year old would be as nonchalant about receiving attention from a boys. Vicky is a very mature 14 year old. I don't think I would have been that way at 14 and looking at my 14 year old daughter now, I don't see her behaving similarly to Vicky. As a parent, I don't think I would have been as willing to let her hang out with Zachary alone. :)"}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1121915-jessica", "userReview": "In a time when most families are lucky to get a week of vacation together (or for some, any vacation together at all!), it was a little hard to suspend my disbelief of this family taking an entire summer off to travel around the country camping.
