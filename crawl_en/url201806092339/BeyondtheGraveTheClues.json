Amy and Dan have found the next clue and have had a near-run-in with the dreaded Madrigals, who have smashed up the Ekat stronghold in Cairo. Allastair Oh has returned from the dead (once again), the Kabras have been led astray to Lake Tash, and Jonah Wizard and his dad are on the way to Morocco after following a false lead. Hot on their trail is bad girl ex-KGB spy Irina, and we have no idea where the Holts are. We gain a little insight into her life, too.

This implies that either: a) Allastair is responsible for that fire, or b) Alistair knows who killed Amy and Dan's parents."}, {"userName": "Tarissa", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2630602-tarissa", "userReview": "My favorite in the entire 39 Clues series so far. I love the educational adventure that these books bring for kids. I'm quite fascinated with Egypt's history, and since Amy and Dan Cahill find themselves in Egypt for this volume, I was happy to be reading this book. Although it doesn't come from from a Christian perspective exactly, this particular book infused something Christian-related into the plot---VERY, very good, Jude Watson! Now, there may have been a comment or two that I didn't quite enjoy in the story, but it all must be taken in stride. It will be a while before I read another 39 Clues book that excites me as much as this one!"}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1735763-laura", "userReview": "The chase continues as 14 year-old Amy Cahill and her 11 year-old brother Dan rush off to Cairo, Egypt in search of the next clue. You can feel the heat and smell the exotic spices as we catch up with the duo at the Khan market. Two new characters are introduced in this book, Theo, an Indiana Jones-type Egyptologist and Hilary, who is the childhood best friend of Grace, Amy and Dan\u2019s dead grandmother. Instantly likable, they play an important part in the story.Amy and Dan learn a little about Grace\u2019s past through Hilary who gives them a card with a message from their grandmother. But the message seems so detached they begin to question why their grandmother (whom they miss terribly) would send them on such a dangerous hunt. This doubting causes pain and friction between the brother and sister, adding internal conflict as the team escape a scary crocodile encounter, a submarine disaster, being buried alive in an Egyptian tomb, and the clutches of the Ekaterina branch members. Alistair Oh makes a brief appearance, but it is Irina Spasky who is close on their tail this time.In addition, it is Irina\u2019s vulnerable side that is revealed in this book. She has a painful history attached to that of Grace, making the reader wonder what exactly happened. I\u2019m getting really curious about Nellie Gomez, too, the children\u2019s au pair who has the uncanny ability to get them out of scraps time and time again. She has very convenient talents. I am certain this isn\u2019t coincidence, and I look forward to seeing how it all plays out in the next books. Finally, I was somewhat disappointed with the way things ended up with Hilary. I would have liked for this relationship to end differently.I must add that the titles of the books have double significance. For example, Beyond the Grave is a good indication the next clue is somewhere in a grave, but also hints at Grace\u2019s message coming from \u201cbeyond the grave\u201d since she is already dead when they receive it. It's a cool play on words, which, by the way, is how the clues are discovered in all the books.This book was another exciting adventure that has me waiting to read the next book in this fun series suitable for all ages."}, {"userName": "Jeremy Juarez", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35375935-jeremy-juarez", "userReview": "Amy and Dan continue their look for the next clue,but find some trouble along the way.They were tailed by Irina Spasky,but escape to a store with an Egyptian goddess statue,the Sakhet.

Con su consabido sentido del humor, siempre est\u00e1 haciendo chistes y quej\u00e1ndose del calor y de que tiene hambre y que odia los museos y las bibliotecas; pero debo admitir que aqu\u00ed se pas\u00f3. Se pas\u00f3 por completo. Hay partes donde se pelea con Amy y es una persona completamente diferente. Me gust\u00f3 much\u00edsimo eso.- Irina. \u00bfDesde cu\u00e1ndo la rusa tiene coraz\u00f3n? \u00bfY marido? \u00bf\u00bf\u00bfE hijos???- Theo. Theo es bello, lo admito.

Lo am\u00e9 instant\u00e1neamente...Ahora, cosas que no me gustaron:- Alistair- Te hubieras quedado muerto, papi, please. No. Me cae mal. De paso, resucit\u00f3 y los carajitos no le preguntaron \"hey, papi, qu\u00e9 pas\u00f3? pana te perdei feo\". No, nada. Absolutamente nada. Ni un \"Hola, c\u00f3mo te fue en el m\u00e1s all\u00e1?

I never imagined that I would see Dan upset. With his usual sense of humor, he is always making jokes and complaining about the heat and that he is hungry and that he hates museums and libraries; But I must admit that it happened here. It happened completely. There are parts where she quarrels with Amy and is a completely different person. I really liked that.- Irina. Since when the Russian has a heart? And husband? And sons???- Theo. Theo is beautiful, I admit. It reminds me of Milo Thatch:I love when he flirts with Nellie, otp.I loved that mix of Indiana Jones and Milo Thatch that he has. I loved it instantly.Now, things I did not like:- Alistair. You shoud have stayed dead, honey, really. No. I do not like him. By the way, he was resurrected and the kids didn't asked him: \"hey, where have you been? you died, you get lost pften, dude\". No, nothing. Absolutely nothing. Not a \"Hi, how was the afterlife?

But they still stay in the hunt, showing time and time again that they think the rewards of the hunt are worth the risks for them."}, {"userName": "Hope", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44486464-hope", "userReview": "awesome. love it"}, {"userName": "Alix", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23691352-alix", "userReview": "I like the book 39 clues\u201dBeyond the Grave\u201d by Jude Watson, because there are a lot of intense situation that happen throughout the book. This is number four in the series.The last book leaves Dan and Amy trapped in a cave. This book continues from there. This book shows you how kids can figure things out by using what they have for resources. It also deals with American history. Dan and Amy are still in the lead to win the race to be the most powerful family in the world. Someone is always fighting to stay afloat in this competition. Dan and Amy next clue lead them to a museum in Egypt . When they get to the museum they find their next clue behind a brick in the museum wall. Dan pulls out a brick and the security guard sees him do it . Dan threw the brick at the security guard so they could escape. The clue was a map and a key. The key they found opened the door to one of the rooms in their hotel. Behind the door there were plans for a doomsday device. This is when it gets very exciting.39 Clues \u201cBeyond the Grave\u201d takes place in modern day Cairo, Egypt.The book 39 clues \u201cBeyond the grave\u201dshows how you have to figure out some of the clues. It makes your mind think as you read how you would try and figure out some of the clues. Trusting no one is more dangerous than just trusting one person. Dan and Amy though they could trust their cousin Natalie, but she ran off with the clue they team up to find. I would recommend this book for any body that likes adventure books. If you like series there are more book that continue from this book. In the 39 clues beyond the grave there are lot of serious situations this book would be great for eighth grade and up.I think some adults would enjoy the 39 Clues series also."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1212796-heather", "userReview": "I'm going to give a generic review of the series. Basically because I'm lazy and don't want to write 39 reviews. Okay, 11.We finally read Book 1. And then because we liked it so well, the entire series. One son (age 12) has read them all, the second son (also age 12) is on Book 2. And son #3 (age 8) will be starting as soon as he finishes his current book.I thought the premise of this book very interesting. I loved how they integrated history and geography along with problem-solving skills and code cracking. Add in the action, humor and intrigue and kids (and some adults) can't put them down. All three of us that have read 39 Clues thought Book 2 the weakest of the series. But as one son said, after finishing the series, \"Gordon Korman seems to be getting better. I think he's a decent author now.\" Some of the books are better at teaching the history part, others just barely skim the surface and you don't really learn about the person they're 'highlighting'. I appreciate that they're clean books - no curse words or you-know-what going on. There is some violence (very little, if any, blood) and several murder attempts, but they never work.The series would most likely be called twaddle by my Charlotte Mason friends. I do, however, think it has more redeeming qualities than most kids literature and I'm happy to see my boys devouring a book every day or so."}, {"userName": "Beaulah Pragg", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5738996-beaulah-pragg", "userReview": "Another excellent book in this ever developing series. I love that reading this book as a young adult, I still get a lot of value and enjoyment out of it. The cover even looks sophisticated enough that I don't feel embarassed reading it at University (when technically I should be studying).This part of the adventure takes place in Egypt, a place I thought would lend to a great deal of stereotype - Tutankhamen, the Pyramids, the Sphinx - you know the deal. Hence I was pleasantly surprised to find that the facts we learn are less obvious and significantly more interesting. The dam in the Nile for example, and the way that the ruins on one island had to be moved to another when the water level rose.I particularly enjoyed the way that the characters became more fleshed out and showed real human flaws and weaknesses. Both Amy and Dan go through a crisis of faith and come out stronger for it. Even the bad guys start showing a few interesting cracks.All up, 39 Clues is turning into a complex story that is so simple to read that you just absorb the complexity in your stride. I am kept guessing right to the end and even when something obvious has happened, I find myself wondering why I didn't see it coming. A great story with wonderful consistency from book to book despite there being four different authors so far."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/611105-jennifer", "userReview": "Book #4. But what clue are we on? Will there be 39 books? Have we only had four clues? It seems like we are probably on clue #11. Okay, so I went on wikipedia and there will be ten books in the series. These are pretty fun kid's books. Better than the Series of Unfortunate Events, not as good as Percy Jackson (which, in turn, is not as good as Artemis Fowl). This series is a quick read. I like the clues and the hunt. I get tired of the getting lost from the au pair and the reality that a hunt like this would be very expensive and time-consuming. The best part about this series is that it is written by multiple authors so a new book comes out about every three months. There is a website for the series and each book comes with clue cards (which I have not seen since I have always read library copies). I went to the website a few months ago on a lunch hour and spent a half hour clicking around and reading back up info. Probably a lot of fun for an 8-14 kid but I wasn't completely sucked in. Also, there are clues hidden in the page numbers of each book. I have not worked them out though. So basically, there is a lot going on that I am not taking advantage of.

Interested in reading the other books. I loved it! I'm a big fan of suspense and mystery, and this book does it right! The series is interesting and a good book about finding clues and betrayal.The 4th installment in the series, betrayed by their cousins, left alone by their uncle, and no idea where they are, Amy and Dan Cahill are completely lost in Egypt with no one to help them guide through the endless crowd of tourists. With also the fact that they're being tracked down by a Russian ex-KGB agent called Irina Spasky. However, they were able to lose her and crossed paths with a man named Theo who helped them find their grandmother, Nellie. They successfully all regrouped and continued the search for the 39 clues. Will they ever find Grace's secret? Will Amy and Dan find the clue after perilous adventures? Or will they be completely lost forever and fail the challenge? And can they trust ANYONE after everything that's happened to them?That's what makes this book feel like a ticking time bomb. I love the suspense and love the series! This book will want you to keep reading and never put it down!

Amy and Dan should have stuck to that all throughout even if it meant meeting their grandmother's best friend. But it paid off in the end anyways 'cause now, Irina Spasky, their ex-KGB cousin, set sail on the wrong destination. LOL. That goes for the Wizards and the Kabras as well. Still no updates from the Holts. Thank you Jude Watson for that nice read. Despite a couple of cliches, it was still good. And I was really fascinated by the historical facts about Egypt.These books may seem very unrealistic to some of the readers. I mean, two underage children travelling the world with their au pair 'cause of this scavenger hunt stated on their grandma's will? That's crazy enough. They also have to deal with their kin who never runs out of homicide attempts. (So much for craziness in their family) And there's this group of peepz called the Madrigals to watch out for. As far as the series went, Amy and Dan had managed to elude a lot of dangers.

It definitely redeemed itself after the less-than-stellar book 3. Once again a new author, a different writing style, and one that I really enjoyed. It was a bit different take on Amy and Dan, with more humour in the mix, but one that I thought worked very well. I also have to praise Jude Watson for her stepping outside the box and telling us some of the past of Irina, Allistair, Bae, and Grace. She delves deep into their motivations and past. Eygpt certainly seems to have an affect on the older members of the hunt!Amy, Dan, and Nellie are in Cairo to hunt down an ancient egyptian artifact that could just contain the next of the 39 clues. Along the way they meet old friends of Grace (some helpful, some treacherous) and Uncle Allistaire decides to \"come back from the (suppossed) dead\" to team up with Amy and Dan once again.
