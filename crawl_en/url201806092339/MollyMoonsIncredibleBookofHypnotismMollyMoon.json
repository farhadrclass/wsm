This book shares a story of a misunderstood, awkward orphan child, who discovers she possesses amazing \"powers\" and creates an incredible life for herself using a book of hypnotism. This book is about an orphan young named Molly Moon hates living in Hardwick House. Every day she is 'bullied' by Miss Adderstone, the owner of the orphanage, who makes Molly's life miserable. Her best and only friend Rocky has just been adopted and is moving to New York City and she finds her life near unbearable. But one day, when Molly stumbles upon a mysterious old book on hypnotism, her world is suddenly turned upside down. She discovers that with this book, she has the amazing power to make people do things. There's nothing Molly believes she can't do now, and starts her works on becoming a New York City Broadway superstar. What Molly doesn't know, is that a stranger is following her with different plans of his own. This book to me is more than just a funny story about an orphan who learns how to hypnotize people. It turns into a moral children's story about exploitation, character, and learning to care for people. Molly is one of those characters you hope never gets hurt, and you hope she gets her revenge because she is constantly being picked on by her peers in the orphanage. I found myself very connected to the characters, but felt like the plot was rushed into and too unbelievable, even coming from a book about a little girl mastering hypnotism. In conclusion, I can say \"Molly Moon's Incredible Book of Hypnotism\" is one of the only books that had kept my attention long enough to finish it. I enjoyed it a lot and I recommend everyone to read it. While reading this book, you could learn a few important life lessons that will surely come in handy."}, {"userName": "Polina", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4310926-polina", "userReview": "Molly Moon's Incredible Book of Hypnotism is really the first book that wowed me. It was a mix of everything I adored. It had the elements of a fantasy, but yet when it was so unreal at times, at others it was just simply about this average potato-nosed, green eyed, skinny, akward looking girl named Molly. By displaying how average Molly was, it made the elements of fantasy in the story seem more believable. I think that a good story balances out the unreal parts of it by adding some regular traits to the characters to make them seem more realistic. This girl grows up in such an unfortunate way and then this sudden shock of happiness makes one hopeful about the future. I found the story amazing, and enjoyed how the author gave importance to even the smallest things and details. This book is one you'll see on the shelf and want to read again, simply because it's familiar and you enjoyed it. This is the kind of book that there needs to be more of because it's an enjoyable story with elements of different genres. I now try to look for books like this one. This was my first real amazing read. This book will set the standards for what makes an amazing book when you go to choose a new book to read. I could really relate to this book, therefore making me enjoy it more. I can't wait for the newest Molly Moon to come out."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4569356-michelle", "userReview": "I really cannot express how much I love this book. I first read it when I was nine and now eight years later I am still enchanted by it. I also cannot remember just how many times I've read it, but each time I finish it I fall in love with it even more. And, each time I start it I attempt to savour every sentence, only to be drawn into it completely and have a marathon reading session for the last quarter of the book. Molly breathed in the fresh cold night air and grinned at the still, sleeping countryside. Tonight, life was almost too exciting. What had she thought when she'd first found the hypnotism book? That the possibilities were endless? Tonight Molly felt that was certainly true about her life. From the top of her head to the tips of her toes. Life felt completely magical. And once again, Molly thought how happy she was to be ordinary, plain old Molly Moon. Ahead, the road shone like a silver ribbon in the moonlight, all the way home to Happiness House.The book follows the story of Molly Moon, an orphan abandoned at birth, as she finds a book that will literally change her life. However, she soon finds out that her new life is not all it's cracked up to be. She realises that she would rather be back in the horrible, grimy old orphanage as long as she can have her best friend Rocky back. Although the novel is mainly from Molly's point of view, there are occasional passages from other point of views, including that of Petula the Pug. Byng uses the technique as a way to inform the audience of situations and feelings that Molly herself is not aware of. I love this element and I feel that it enhances the book, without detracting from Molly's story. The chapters are relatively short, especially towards the end, which helps with the flow of the book. The story is also quite fast-paced, with no boring bits which is also a plus. Overall it is an absolutely charming story which teaches audiences that the grass is not always greener on the other side. Absolutely superb!"}, {"userName": "Wezy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1415881-wezy", "userReview": "Orphan Molly Moon was found as a baby in a box marked 'Moon's Marshmallows'.For ten miserable years she's lived under the cruel rule of Miss Adderstone in grim Hardwick House.

It's a refreshing fantasy-adventure tale in that our young, parent-less heroine isn't trying to save the world from the ultimate evil (aren't you getting a little sick of that worn-out plot?) but instead escaping an awful life and having her every wish fulfilled. Until, of course, she realizes that having your every wish fulfilled is never all it's cracked up to be. True, it's a little cheeseball with the moral, but, like I said, I enjoyed it, and I don't doubt that many kiddos will too. Side note: I honestly thought for a long time that this was a book about a dog named Molly Moon because there's a dog on the cover, but the dog is actually a pug named Petula who (also refreshingly) is pretty much a normal-acting dog and not a talking one. Additional side note: There's an ice cream shop in Seattle called Molly Moon's that has a dog in its logo. Coincidence?

Before I started, I thought it would be a poor rendition in the Harry Potter/magical/fantastical genre, but I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised and quite enjoyed it. It's about a young girl in an orphanage who is typically picked on and made fun of. She finds that she has the power to hypnotize people, and through pluck and ingenuity, embarks on escapades and adventures while doing good. Well-written and unique enough to stand on its own and apart from Harry Potter.

She is described as being plain looking with a large \"potato\" nose, wobbly knees and green eyes. She is usually beaten down upon by Ms. Adderstone, the woman in charge of the orphanage, and Hazel, a snobby orphan girl. During a cross-country race at school, Molly and Rocky have a fight and Molly storms away to the town library. As she walks in, she finds a man yelling at the librarian about a book he ordered, but ignores him. While looking in a curious compartment of the restricted section, she finds a book on hypnotism, placed in the wrong section because the \"H\" was ripped off the spine. Intrigued, she steals it and sneaks out of the library. She takes it to the orphanage to read it.She fakes being ill so that she can study the book better. Curiously, she finds that chapters 7 and 8 (\"Voice-Only Hypnosis\" and \"Long Distance Hypnosis\") are missing. Not long after her discovery of the book, she learns that Rocky has been adopted and taken to America with his new family. Determined to see her friend again, she gains the actual ability to hypnotize from the lessons in her book, first successfully hypnotizing the orphanage dog, Petula. Later on, she is able to hypnotize both Ms. Adderstone and their orphanage chef Edna. Using her ability, Molly wins a large sum of money from a local talent competition, by hypnotizing the crowd into believing that she is a talented singer and dancer. She uses the money to fly to New York City, taking Petula with her. Before leaving, she buys a large gold pendulum, where the mysterious professor from the library learns about her, after he bought some anti-hypnosis glasses.Soon after arriving, Molly hypnotizes her way onto Broadway, landing the lead in a musical called \"Stars on Mars\". However, she steals this part from a real child star, named Davina Nuttel, in the process. The show is a roaring success, and catches the attention of a man named Simon Nockman, who has passed himself off as a \"professor\" of hypnosis, but is truly just a criminal. He theorizes Molly must have obtained the book and learned hypnosis, and formulates a plan. After one performance of \"Stars on Mars\", Nockman kidnaps Petula, threatening to kill her if Molly does not comply with his orders, and she cannot hypnotize him because he always wears the anti-hypnotic glasses he bought in Briersville. He orders her to use her power of hypnosis to rob some rare jewels from a bank for him.Having no choice, Molly agrees. All goes as planned with the robbery until she finds Rocky, who much to her surprise has also learned hypnosis. He had previously stolen and learned from the missing chapters of Molly's hypnotism book, \"Long Distance Hypnosis\" and \"Voice-Only Hypnosis\". He also reveals that he had intended to take Molly with him when he was adopted, but had not been able to hypnotize his parents. Since then, he left them as they were not much fun. Together, the two pull off the robbery, but later form a plan to return the jewels. Rocky uses his talent to hypnotize Nockman into giving up his life of crime. He then helps Molly return the stolen jewels by placing them in hollow garden gnomes and placing them around the city. However, Molly keeps one diamond, which Petula found in her jacket.Molly gives her part in \"Stars on Mars\" back to Davina, and returns home with Rocky. Out of sympathy for the broken man, she takes Nockman with her. Before leaving, they work together to record a commercial, using their hypnotic powers to convince people to be kind to their kids. However, when they return, they find Ms. Adderstone and Edna have disappeared, leaving the orphanage in chaos. With Nockman's help, Molly and Rocky get the orphanage back into a livable condition, and get Ms. Trinklebury, the orphanage maid, to run it along with Nockman. The orphanage is renamed 'Happiness House' and the money that Molly earned in New York is used to buy new things and decorate the orphanage. However, it is implied that Nockman has returned to his old ways as he steals a camera, a lollipop and five pounds from children in the orphanage.At the end of the book, Molly is mysteriously summoned to the library by the librarian, Lucy Logan. Lucy explains that she is the descendant of Professor Logan, the man who originally wrote the hypnotism book, and is a skilled hypnotist herself. She had purposely hypnotized Molly into finding Professor Logan's hypnotism book and keeping it for a month. Now, Molly must return it.In an epilogue, it is revealed what happened to Ms. Adderstone and Edna; Ms. Adderstone left to become a pilot, and Edna is now an Italian chef. \""}, {"userName": "Samuelle", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13876128-samuelle", "userReview": "I don't remember much about this book except for the fact that i LOVED it."}, {"userName": "Cristina Boncea", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5484880-cristina-boncea", "userReview": "Molly nu-\u0219i cunoscuse niciodat\u0103 p\u0103rin\u021bii \u0219i locuia la C\u0103minul Hardwick \u00eempreun\u0103 cu al\u021bi copii abandona\u021bi.

As for my adult critique--the writing wasn't that great, the hypnotism was way over-used. (Mollie is explaining her gift of hypnotism to Rocky while he is hypnotizing her, while she and he have both been hyptonized by the librarian, etc.) It reminded me of that Tom Cruise movie MI 2? where every time you turned around someone (good or bad) pulled off a rubber mask showing that they weren't who you just thought they were. The first time it was cool and surprising. The rest of the time it just became ridiculous.Also, while unrealistic on so many levels, the idea that a 10 year old girl lives in New York City eating ketchup sandwiches and candy, comes back to her orphanage in England and lectures the other children about the need for good, healthy food and a well-balanced diet.

She knows I hate them, that\u2019s why she gives it to me!\u201d The idea of being able to get revenge for being served vegetables they hate and being force-marched to bed at 9 o\u2019clock makes Molly Moon a fun and silly read for the 8-12 crowd.I also made the mistake of reading it by myself. It was actually a restart. Mags and I had started reading it last spring and had to set it aside when we were 1/3 the way through while she went to visit her dad. We never picked it back up, and I figured it\u2019d be a quick book to help me hit my 75-book goal (this one makes number 68, only 7 to go ) I remember we\u2019d laughed and laughed until tears came into our eyes and my throat was hoarse from doing the voices and cackling so much. Without her, however, I only chuckled a couple times and found myself wishing I was sharing it with her.

In this book, Molly lives a dismal life in the Hardwick Orphanage, and the owner is a cranky old lady, whose name is Mrs. Ardwick. Mrs. Ardwick not fond of little children, but that is exactly what Molly is: a little girl. She has only one friend, named Rocky. She and Rocky have to face Mrs. Ardwick's bad temper, breath, and lots and lots of work. But one day, when Molly is lolling around in the library, she finds a book about hypnotism. She finds out about her hypnotic power, so she hypnotizes her way out of the orphanage, makes the usually mad dog be one of her best friends,and escapes the drammy orphanage to the airport, buys a ticket to LA, and hynotises her way into a posh hotel, and orders room service and everything for free. Then, a mean, sinister man who also wants the hypnotism book for himself, follows Molly to LA, and hunts her down. He forces her to do some dirty work for him, otherwise he will kill her dog.That is what mainly happens in the story, and I won' say any more."}, {"userName": "Suhitha", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6743171-suhitha", "userReview": "Molly Moon's Incredible Book of Hypnotism was a great book! It was a constant page turner filled with suspense on each page. This book was adventurous and made me feel like I was there watching the whole thing happen! Even when I was not reading the book, I still felt like I was In Molly's world. The book was about a young orphan named Molly, who found the key to her life... the book of hypnotism. Ever since the book landed in Molly's hands, it had changed her life forever. She had traveled from England all the way to New York, using her new skills of Hypnotism to get her way around things. As soon as she lands In New York, she immediately begins her new, dream job of starring in broadway musicals. She hypnotizes everyone into thinking that she is amazing and enjoys her luxuries and fame. Unfortunately, one day she gets blackmailed by a professor and gets talked into robbing a bank. Then she gets told that if she does not rob the bank, then her secret will be let out. What will Molly do?

And if I do have to read about them, there better be a good payoff in the end.\"The payoff was there but it was way late and a dollar short. I found none of the characters to be likable enough to inspire my attention and the moral, the lesson, the moment of redemption, remorse and reconfiguring, was not boldly drawn so as to make up for the pages and pages and pages of selfish, irresponsible behavior perpetrated by all of the book's characters.It was readable. And the story was interesting, if purposefully odd in its Charles Dickens orphan meets A Star is Born. But I, like the reviewer quoted above, would have quit looooong before the end had I not read that there WAS a moral. I'm glad I kept reading. But this is not one for kids who aren't really paying attention to each word. This is a book that must be finished or the lesson becomes \"do whatever you want whenever you want as long as it makes you happy.\" Not a good lesson, that."}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2057823-becky", "userReview": "HA HA what a hillarious read! In this amazing and well...hypnotizing novel, you will learn about a girl named Molly Moon with an extraordinary talent, hypnotism. Watch as she uses her electric green eyes and drowsy voice to set people all over into trances. Follow Molly as she puts people into trances and even uses her powers to rob a jewel bank! all for a good cause though. Of course she has to learn how to hypnotise and that is where the old book she finds in the school library comes in. This book is amazing, it teaches her how to control people only using her eyes! she decides that she hates her life at the orphanage in england and chooses to go to the city that never sleeps, New York. Here she hypnotises her way to success but later deserts her glamourous life to go back to her life in england because her friends, almost like brothers and sisters need her help. Put it this way...this book is good with spontanious and vindictive charactors. I found this book to be a funny, adventourous and totally awesome at the same time. Out of ten would give this book a 20"}, {"userName": "Wendy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1728859-wendy", "userReview": "The dull orphan of Hardwick House Orphanage is like aby ordinary orphan.

Seriously, if I was Molly, I would totally rebel. Rebel against everything in that awful hell-hole of an orphanage. She is like a priest for having such tolerance for all of the disrespect and vulgarity she is given there. If someone told me that I had to wash out all of the toilet bowls with my own tooth brush for a week as a penalty to \"using too much bathwater\" I would WITHOUT A DOUBT not do it. I really hope that things like this don't happen in real life orphanages. On a brighter note, this book was cute, because you kind of got to explore the ambitions of a child living in a disgusting, poorly maintained/run orphanage. It's really adorable how Molly talks about the Qube Soda ads she sees on billboards and on TV, and how she just longs for the moment where she gets her revenge on everyone who was disrespectful to her in the orphanage."}, {"userName": "Karen Field", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1548610-karen-field", "userReview": "Molly Moon\u2019s Incredible Book of Hypnotism by Georgia Byng is a children\u2019s book that breaks all the rules. When an agent or a publisher tells a writer that they cannot write about people smoking, or about children doing naughty things (like stealing and running away)\u2026don\u2019t listen to them, because this book has all these things and more.The author tells an interesting story about an orphan girl who finds an old book on Hypnotism in the local library. The girl\u2019s name is Molly Moon and she discovers that if she puts the lessons from the book into action, she can literally get anything she wants. She uses this art to better herself, in quite a selfish way, and at the expense of others. However, all the \u201cbad\u201d things she does lead to a lesson to be learned and I felt the author tackled these issues quite well.The story is humorous, unusual and well written.

The kids decide to stop using hypnosis and be fair. I mean, WTF?! You can hypnotize whoever you want, get whatever you want, and you decide to throw it all away! Why can't someone finally write a book about people using their special powers for themselves and only for themselves, and that they're not a villain? I'm sick of all goody-goody characters.
