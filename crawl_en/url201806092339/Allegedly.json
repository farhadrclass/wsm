Sometimes the best kind of books are those that make me sad, afraid and just FURIOUS for the characters - and this was one of those books. If you want to be angry, then put this on your reading list.In fact, it was a solid five-star read up until the very last chapter. The ending took a turn that I thought weakened the story; throwing in a last minute \"oh my god!\" for the sake of thrills, but losing some of the powerful messages that had been built throughout. That being said, I would still recommend this to anyone with a strong stomach and a liking for thought-provoking reads that shine a light on some of the darker aspects of the world we live in.Mary B. Addison is a black teenager who allegedly killed a three-month-old baby when she, herself, was nine. The white baby girl, Alyssa, was left in the care of Mary and her mentally ill mother, but when her parents returned later that evening, Alyssa was heavily-bruised and no longer breathing. Fast forward to the present and Mary has just been transferred from \"baby jail\" to a group home.\nMost of my life, no one has bothered to explain anything to me. It\u2019s been one \u201c\u2019cause I said so\u201d scenario after another. I stopped asking questions and in six years I have not run into one adult who would do me the common courtesy of explaining why something is happening to me.\nIt is told in a very straightforward style without feeling emotionally manipulative, complete with urban slang/AAVE. For me, this kind of narration is all the more powerful for its simplicity - the only authors who can pull a strong emotional reaction out of me are the ones who don't seem like they're trying to. Mary is an extremely complex and sympathetic human being, bullied by the other girls she lives with and the women who work at her group home. She longs to take the SAT and go to college, but doing so requires a lot of complicated hoop-jumping, and those in charge of her well-being constantly discourage her by pointing out how colleges and employees will not want a murderer.She is stuck; unable to change her life, better herself, or make any of her own decisions. If I wasn't already pissed, I would have been the minute she becomes pregnant and the adults decide that her baby will be adopted. As someone who is an advocate for reproductive rights/choices AND a new mother, I was enraged. It also prompted me to do some further reading about the babies of pregnant prisoners being taken away and the high depression rates of those women - it is truly so heartbreaking and scary.\n\u201cWhat does it mean when you love and hate someone at the same time?\u201d I ask.He laughs. \u201cIt means they family.\u201d\nMary suddenly finds new reason to fight for her freedom when they threaten to take her baby away. But it's a complicated battle and it seems like the whole world is against her. She is torn between her natural desire to protect her sick mother, and her need to tell the truth. She hits roadblock after infuriating roadblock in her quest for justice.Though I desperately wanted many things to turn out different, I also felt that Jackson made it very easy to understand Mary's reactions and decisions, for the most part. She also highlights the importance of black female friendships and support - something so rare in YA, where people tend to celebrate the inclusion of the lone non-white character - and it is extremely moving. Seventeen out of eighteen chapters were utterly fantastic. I just can't help feeling let down by that ending.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"}, {"userName": "Deanna ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15662887-deanna", "userReview": "My reviews can also be seen at: https://deesradreadsandreviews.wordpr...Oh my...ALL THE STARS!!This is a dark, emotional, twisted, and powerful novel that blew my mind.Mary B. Addison killed a baby when she was just nine years old...AllegedlyThree month old Alyssa Richardson was taken care of by Mary's mother, Dawn Marie Cooper.

She is anxiously awaiting a visit from the most conniving woman in the world....Her mother.Every other Sunday, her mother comes to visit her at the group home where Mary now lives. She arrives at 2:35, right after church. Hair, make-up, and clothing all perfect. Always putting on a show, even if no one is watching.\"Momma is all about appearances\"Many people think she's a wonderful mother who deserves an award for visiting Mary.\"Inside her bubble, nothing or no one could get her down. She smiled during evictions, smiled after Ray would beat the shit out of her, smiled when we were dead broke, and even smiled during my manslaughter sentencing (\"See baby, it's not so bad. At least it's not murder!\"). She's the most optimistic person on earth. Even when she's visiting her daughter in a group home.\"Her Momma doesn't ask how she's doing. She talks about Church and Mr. Worthington, Mary's new stepfather. Talks about all the good food she eats and trips she's taken.

There's even books written about what happened....The Devil Inside: The Mary B. Addison Story and What Happened to Alyssa?Throughout her trial she never spoke a word. When she was sentenced she never spoke. However, things are different now. Now Mary has a very important reason to speak up.But after all of this time can she? Will people believe her? Should they believe her?What really happened to baby Alyssa?I flew through this book. Honestly I could have read this book in one sitting if time had allowed. I was so engrossed in the story and Mary's past and present. The story is told from Mary's point of view. It flows well and is easy to follow. We see how the case played out in the media. There are news articles, book excerpts, court transcripts, depositions, and interviews interspersed throughout the book. All of this added to the story.Mary is an awesome and complex character. I think that all of the characters came across as realistic. Damaged and flawed but still real. The author writes about relationships in a way that is authentic and compelling. It was fascinating reading the dynamic relationships between characters, especially between mother and daughter.I think that this is a fantastic novel. Very well written. It's hard to believe that it's the author's debut novel. Powerful, heart-breaking, suspenseful, and gripping. Any way you cut it, in my opinion it's an amazing read.I am really looking forward to reading more from Tiffany D. Jackson.Thank you, Katherine Tegen Books for providing an advanced copy of this book for me to read in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Kristin (KC) - Traveling Sister", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4971692-kristin-kc---traveling-sister", "userReview": "*4 stars*This story spoke to me in a voice so pained and confused and hopeless: An eight year old girl convicted of murdering of an infant. Allegedly. The plot is set eight years after with Mary, now sixteen, living in a group home amongst other \u201ctroubled\u201d girls, facing an everyday fight for her own survival. Mary is still just as pained and confused and hopeless, and I can almost feel her not looking me in the eye as she tells me her story. I loved this book just about all the way through; its grit and bravery astounding me. Its smooth flow and natural dialogue pulling me quickly through its pages, squeezing my heart in the palm of its eager grip. And then something happened that changed its dynamic in a way I wasn't hoping for nor expecting. Maybe it became too fabricated. Maybe it became too real. I felt cheated and sad and angry. And then I realized that maybe we as readers aren't supposed to love everything about this one. Maybe we\u2019re only supposed to FEEL it. Really, truly feel it - straight down to our bones - and that I did.I can appreciate the turn out, now that my boiling feelings have simmered, because it represents something bold that delivers a powerful statement, no matter how painful and ugly. That\u2019s not to say I\u2019m not left with residual angst, because I am. I also found myself wanting more story, which is a first for me as I\u2019m not an overkill kinda gal. But in this case, a little more would have sufficed. However, I must give credit where it\u2019s due: Allegedly is a beautifully written book, one that will no doubt rip you out of your comfort zone and place you somewhere unique and fearless--which is basically all I can ask for in fiction."}, {"userName": "C.G.

Although I've only made it through four books so far! Lol! Book ruts happen! Absolutely phenomenal debut by Tiffany D. Jackson! All the feels! This was probably one of the best audio's I have ever listened to. The narrator, Bahni Turpin, hits it out of the park! Truly brilliant! I will be listening to more of her audio's in the near future. That's for sure. She's so good!Mary B. Addison is 15 and in a group home/halfway house. She \"allegedly\" killed a baby 6 years prior from where the story begins. Did she kill the baby? Does Mary get out and start her life? What happens to Mary in the home? Well I'm not going to say, but if you read this, you will go down the rabbit hole and into Mary's dark, sometimes funny and twisted world!Even if you do not normally read YA you might love this one.Highly recommended!!!"}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31923026-laura", "userReview": "Beyond compelling. Well-crafted. Simply unputdownable. I could not stop reading until I found out the truth. It\u2019s shocking that this is only the author\u2019s debut!Mary B. Addison allegedly killed a baby at nine years old. Mary\u2019s mother was babysitting the three month old baby when it happened. She never said what happened, but was convicted anyway and has rarely spoken since. Did Mary do what everyone says she did?\nGuess birthdays don\u2019t mean nothing in a group home. I mean, it kind of makes sense. Hard to celebrate the day you were born when everybody seems to wish you were never born at all. Especially after you come into this world and fuck it all up.\nShe was in \u201cbaby jail\u201d for six years until the state decided she wasn\u2019t a threat and could be put in a group home where she has been for three months when our story starts. It\u2019s awful, which is a nice way of putting it. The girls are horrible and are all there for serious crimes themselves, only they hate Mary from the beginning like most everyone she comes into contact with. Because she is a baby killer after all. Allegedly.Eventually Mary finds out she is pregnant with another nursing home volunteer\u2019s baby. This changes things when she comes under the realization that nobody in their right mind is going to let her keep her baby when she is in the system especially with the crime she committed. So for the first time Mary is going to fight to clear her name. What really happened to baby Alyssa?The story is interwoven with fragments and excerpts from books, newspaper articles, depositions, police interview transcripts, magazine articles, and several other different kinds of reports. This helped to break up the story slowly revealing the details of Mary\u2019s crime through the eyes of those involved in the case (whether police, witnesses, or even the media reporting on it). Other than these excerpts/fragments, the entire story is told from Mary\u2019s perspective. I enjoyed her voice. She is complex and one hell of a narrator.\nThat joke of a bookshelf has the same crap they had in baby jail I\u2019ve inhaled three times over and I\u2019d kill for something - anything - new to read. But I\u2019d never say that out loud. I\u2019m a killer after all; they\u2019d probably think I\u2019d really do it. Figures of speech are luxuries convicted murderers are not allowed to have.\nThis book had a way of tugging at your heartstrings while also immersing you into this dark world. It was truly the perfect blend of contemporary realistic fiction and mystery/thriller. I could not get enough! I enjoyed how the criminal justice system and state foster care system played such a huge part in the story. It is a harsh reality and was depicted in a way that shows just how much research went into writing this novel. It\u2019s phenomenal.It\u2019s brilliant how the author displayed the effects of sensationalization done in the media. And there\u2019s the look at mental health and life in a group home. Not to mention the real star of the story which ended up being the increasingly convoluted relationship Mary has with her mother.\nBut I can\u2019t be a fly, not today. I have to prepare. Be on high alert and focused. Because in a few hours, the most dangerous, most diabolical, most conniving woman in the world is visiting me today:My mother.\nThere are so many elements of  Allegedly that I could rave about. That ending! The fact that it was based on the actual 2012 case in Maine where a ten year old girl was charged with manslaughter of a three month old baby while her mother was supposed to be babysitting. Diversity!! It\u2019s dark and filled with the most compelling writing I\u2019ve read in a while. The main point here is that you should definitely read this book. It will 100% keep you guessing leaving you on the edge of your seat. I can\u2019t wait to see what Jackson comes out with next."}, {"userName": "Elyse", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse", "userReview": "One of the best things this book did for me was have me explore more about theAmerican juvenile justice system. I found myself reading about other high profile cases about children who commit murder, the psychology behind it, and punishment. The current debate on juvenile justice reform in the United States focuses on the root of racial and economic discrepancies in theincarcerated youth population. Zero tolerance policies in schools have increased and numbers of young people facing detention. Low income youth, youth of color with learning and cognitive disabilities are over represented in the justice system and aredisproportionately targeted by zero tolerated policies. Plus much of the criticism revolves around the effectiveness and rehabilitating juvenile delinquent. This book was a mixed-bag for me -- mostly because I wished for the story to have moved in a different direction---more 'direct' focus on rehabilitation- for a child's crime- was my interest ---but I understand the high ratings. I think it's a great discussion book... which opens questions from \"should kids who commit adult crimes go to jail in the first place\"? to.... how do we get to the bottom of what really happened when a child is accused of a killing? It was not a matter of me liking or disliking the ending of the story..... I'm actually neutral about it --but the choice that the author made invalidates the purpose of the entire story. It was a manipulative type ending.... which didn't fit - didn't flow - didn't match well with the rest of the story. Even if people liked it - or didn't like it --- either way --- it was a very controlled tightly chosen ending. As I say... I'm neutral about it myself --my emotions aren't strong one way or another about it. However ...The ending took away some of the integrity and authenticity of what I believe the authors overall purpose was in telling this tale: which was to give us an inside look at a broken juvenile justice system. Tiffany D. Jackson got many parts right though too. We 'do' see and feel the injustice around race for example. We do see how hard it is to rehabilitate the youth from a group home for trouble kids. We feel the cruelty, the abuse, emotional and physical...and we see how horrible it is to be in a facility where because of a high profile case everyone knows your specific story: your horrendous crime: whether it's true or not. As for the love story in here - well, I could have taken it or left it. There was some stereotyping and predictable scenes..... again --I was kinda neutral about this part of the story. Overall -- there some important things in this book. Plus, for me it generated expanded interest. I deepen my awareness and hope that we come up with better solutions to reform juveniles that commit a crime.... solutions that work - for them and Society. 3.5 rating"}, {"userName": "Lindsay - Traveling Sister", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54886546-lindsay---traveling-sister", "userReview": "4 stars! This was an intense, gripping and powerful read! And that ending!?!?!?.....I\u2019m still working on picking my jaw up off the floor\u2026\u2026The story follows Mary who, at the age of nine, was convicted of murdering a three-month-old baby. Mary is now fifteen years old and living in a group home after surviving six years in \u201cbaby jail\u201d. Mary\u2019s situation really got to me \u2013 I found myself rooting for her from the first chapter. The novel is highly emotional, disturbing and very sad at times. With that being said, it is so well-written that it sucked me right into the suspenseful drama where I was hanging on every single word eagerly anticipating what would happen next. The characters were very well-developed. I had strong feelings (both good and/or bad) for each character \u2013 several times I wanted to reach right into the book to interfere with the storyline and where \u2018I thought\u2019 it was headed.I will warn readers to be ready for some BIG feelings (mainly sad) when reading this intense story. The group home setting is very negative and quite hard to read at times. Though I found myself cringing through a lot of the story detail, I have to hand it to the author, Tiffany D. Jackson, for making me feel a whirlwind of strong emotions. Jackson packs a powerful punch \u2013 this story made me feel anxious, hopeful, nervous, upset, heartbroken, disappointed, shocked, angry and frustrated.It was such a fantastic experience to buddy read this with my amazing GR pal Kristin \u2013 it was so nice to have someone along with me on this crazy ride!

It was a tough, really exhausting read. Normally, I could finish a book in two days, one if it\u2019s an easy read but I had to stop reading Allegedly every after a few chapters and read something light and fun because the plot of this story is like a hard punch in the gut. It\u2019s blatant, it\u2019s violent, it\u2019s nasty, it\u2019s gritty, it\u2019s painful and you just have to have enough guts to be able to go through the story. I could not remember the last time I felt so stressed out by a novel but I think that suggests a good thing because it only means that the story and the characters got through me.What drew me to this novel is basically the premise. Teenage girls who committed serious crimes but are not old enough to go to prison stay together at a group home. Go figure the outcome. The group home is basically like the Hunger Games exclusively for girls but this one\u2019s worse because they\u2019re not mandated to kill each other. They simply just want to. I swear I could hear my heart beat against my chest every time I picked the book up worrying about what horrors await this time. That\u2019s what Mary (who at nine years old was allegedly convicted of murdering a baby) had to face every day. That\u2019s only the background picture though because the bigger picture is this- Mary who is now 16 is going to have a baby. How effin' ironic is that?! The characters felt real and the entire thing was very genuine because of the straight to the point writing using the voice of Mary, as she narrates the story. The book is emotionally a challenging read but I admire the author for boldly addressing social issues like racism (as Mary is a black girl who is convicted of killing a white baby), abuse, parental neglect and so many other bigger social issues that are often taken for granted. The only thing that didn\u2019t work well for me is the ending because as much as I enjoy surprises and plot twists, I honestly don\u2019t think it worked this time for this novel. For me, it didn\u2019t sit well with the preceding events of the story or perhaps, it was a bit forced. But still, this is a pretty strong debut novel and if you\u2019re up for a challenge and want to go out of your comfort zone, this is highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Dem", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2752994-dem", "userReview": "What a terrific suspenseful and disturbing debut novel by Tiffany D Jackson.\nMary B.

Allegedly is one of them.After I finished this compelling novel, I needed some time to process everything that was going on in the book, as well as calm myself so I could understand my feelings.Reading this, you probably think I\u2019m exaggerating.If I was you, I\u2019d probably think the same.But I am telling the truth. Sometimes we don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to react to a certain book, and sometimes our reactions can surprise us.Going into this story, I knew it would be difficult for me. I was even aware how disturbing it was.You probably hear about Allegedly, as one of novels written in own voices, one that was praised in \u201creading diversity\u201d movement (if that\u2019s a movement, I\u2019m not 100% sure), the book that is important to read.First of all, I agree with the statement how it is important for this book to be read, and for author\u2019s voice to be heard.This is one hugely important, disturbing book that represents not only people of color, but minority that we don\u2019t get to read often about \u2013 teenagers in group home.Honestly, I am afraid how I\u2019m going to sound when I say this, but I will say it anyway: this novel reminded me how happy my life is. When I reflect and compare it to lives like ones I read about in this novel, to teenagers who yes, committed crimes during their lives, but are still alive and have to live with invisible \u201cScarlet letter\u201d that follows them every where they go, without support of their families, in poverty and with someone else deciding about everything in their life, I understand how privileged I actually am.And once again, I used the word I am really not a fan of, but there is no other word to say it better.The story is told in first person, following Mary\u2019s POV.Beside Mary\u2019s narration (and I have to state that Mary is one of the best narrators I had a pleasure to read about), there are bunch of newspaper articles, police interviews, excerpts from doctor\u2019s papers and other similar stuff.Reading Allegedly was thought provoking and emotional experience.It definitely wasn\u2019t easy.Some scenes were violent and disturbing, some were harder to understand, some were extremely sad, but what hit me the most was how everyone underestimated Mary all the time.I rooted for her, even though she never stated if she did it, if she killed the baby. She said she did, allegedly.But yet, you as a reader don\u2019t believe she would do such a thing. She does not seem like that kind of person.The writing style is amazing, and I simply can not believe this is a debut novel.One more thing I\u2019d like to emphasize is the role of the State (here I mean criminal justice system and state foster care).Mary\u2019s (and other girls\u2019) destiny depended so much on those two, that it feels like the State has it\u2019s own personality.There is one more thing we need to discuss: the last chapter.I tried and tried to decide whether I like how this story ended.At fist I was shocked, but resolved that I liked it.Now, after some thinking, I wish the story ended differently.Why?Because, even though I understand why the writer chose to end the story the way she did, I can\u2019t help but feel that some messages delivered through the story were (partly) erased with that conclusion.Fun fact: When doing my research, I found out that this book was inspired by true event that happened in 2012, when 10 years old girl was charged with manslaughter of a three month old baby.\nRead this and more reviews on my blog: http://bookdustmagic.wordpress.com"}, {"userName": "Kelly (and the Book Boar)", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11183856-kelly-and-the-book-boar", "userReview": "Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier to keep an animal in a cage than to play with it.\u201d\nMy friend SUSAN\u2019s review is what put Allegedly on my radar.

This is how mary B. Addison became a household name\u2026 was there something that made her snap, or was the evil dormant all along?\n4.5 StarsAllegedly is a brilliantly written, well plotted piece of fiction that speaks to deep, dark truths in modern society. THE CHARACTERSMary is beautifully released as the main character. She perfectly incapsulates a mixture of intellectual potential, voiceless exhaustion and clear-eyed awareness of the hopelessness of her own position. At times it was emotionally exhausting being in her mind. I really loved how realistically her choices and decisions were portrayed. She was a poorly socialised, lonely, disenfranchised 15 year old and many of the choices she made, and situations she found herself in, reflected that reality.\nShe smiled during evictions, smiled after Ray would beat the shit out of her, smiled when we were dead broke, and even smiled during my manslaughter sentencing\u2026 she was the most optimistic person on earth.\n The relationship between Mary and her mother was so well done. Being in an abusive relationship where the abuse is hidden creates huge cognitive dissonance. I felt like this confusion was handled sensitively and honestly. However, not all the characters were as realistically drawn. In a book about a girl unfairly demonised it is worth noting that much of the monstrous violence of the other girls goes unexplored and unchallenged. Some of the other supporting characters were well drawn, others not so much. What is of note was the exchange between the therapist and the girls. The therapist, an affluent, educated woman, attempts to relate to the girls:\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry to hear you say that, Kelly,\u201d she says, her voice shaky but determined. \u201cBut I am trying my best to . . . give you the emotional tools . . . to help you succeed.\u201d\u201cHow? By making us write in these stupid books?\u201dKelly tosses her book in the middle of the circle. Ms. Veronica\u2019s face stiffens.\u201cYou know, even though I haven\u2019t been exactly in your situations, I can still relate,\u201d she says, growing defensive. \u201cI . . . I lost my first boyfriend, my first love. And I was in a dark place for a long time. Even had to move back home with my parents. But I dug my way out of my depression, went back to school, and found a career that I love. So you see, ladies, I\u2019m here, almost to be an inspiration. That you, too, can overcome anything.\u201dAn entire minute goes by and no one says nothing. Finally, Kelly busts out laughing.\u201cWhat is so funny?\u201d Ms. Veronica demands, clearly offended.\u201cYo, Ms. V,\u201d China says slowly. \u201cNo disrespect, but are you really trying to tell me you having a dead boyfriend is like being in a group home?\u201dMs. Veronica\u2019s face turns red. She starts to say something but stops herself.\nI thought this was a really important exchange. So many people who work with people with complex needs come from a paternalistic position. They have very little understanding of the realities of their clients lives and are confused when clients aren't compliant because \"I'm trying to help you\" without acknowledging that, in many cases, compliance with the worker is demanded- to keep their housing, their government payments, to keep them out of gaol or in the hopes of regaining or retaining custody of their children. I was really pleased to see a darker reality of social work. People who go into case work \"to inspire and help people\" are often looking to get their own needs met through client compliance, not the other way round. THE PLOTI had my heart in my throat for a lot of the novel. I desperately wanted to see Mary receive justice and was so afraid it wasn't going to work out for her. Unfortunately, I felt that the ending was a bit of a let down. The story was engaging enough- I didn't feel any twist was necessary and it weakened an otherwise very strong novel. The writing was simply perfect. The style was sparse, littered with slang, and felt appropriate to the content. THEMESThere are some very obvious themes here- racism, powerlessness, grief, the cycle of poverty and crime, media justice and our obsession with murderers. These were handled with a deft hand. Although I was aware of them I was primarily reading a story. Which exactly how reading fiction should feel.This is a powerful story that reflects some stark realities. I loved it.Recommended for: Readers who liked Dangerous Girls and The Hate U Give, readers who enjoy reading about sociological issues, people who like thrillers and contemporary fiction. This is not YA. If you usually avoid the genre let me reassure you that it has none of the painful cliches that can ruin adult enjoyment in YA stories."}, {"userName": "Taryn Pierson", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13977687-taryn-pierson", "userReview": "If you\u2019ve ever been unexpectedly dive-bombed by a bird, then you know how it feels to read the ending of Allegedly.

Heart pounding, eyes darting, you might illogically wonder for a moment if you hallucinated the whole thing.But no, it really happened, you have indeed been the victim of avian intimidation, and yes, Tiffany D. Jackson really did just execute the debut novel equivalent of a mic drop.Mary Addison was nine years old when she killed a baby. Allegedly.

When she finds out she\u2019s pregnant and the social workers tell her she won\u2019t be allowed to keep her baby, she decides it\u2019s time to tell her story.

I\u2019ve seen this book compared to Orange is the New Black, and I can see where they\u2019re coming from with the way Turpin brings all the voices of the girls in the group home to life. It\u2019s not a happy place, and there\u2019s a lot of yelling in just about every accent you can imagine. The soft, almost tender way she reads Mary\u2019s words makes the first-person narration even more intimate.

Jackson. Purposefully, I haven't been reading much YA lately so I put a lot of trust in my fellow adult reviewers who have been showering this title with shiny 4 and 5 stars. After reading, I can safely say the praise isn't too generous and it isn't undeserved. In my experience, it has been difficult to find complex YA that is as captivating for adults as it is for teens. They are few and far between in my opinion. Allegedly held my attention from start to finish. I was engaged and invested, and found it surprisingly unpredictable at the end which is a feat for this genre. The realistic quality of this novel is strong. Over half of my career in the field of behavioral health has been spent in the dependency system. I know foster care, therapeutic group homes, and even \u201cbaby jail\u201d inside and out and this portrayal of a minor growing up in these settings is not far from the truth.

Sometimes when this happens we too think that the book is awesome.

What I can say is that I enjoyed Deanna\u2019s review more than I did the actual book.I had to set the bad grammar aside in this book because it was told from the first person point of view. The grammatical errors were done intentionally to showcase the lack of education of our narrator. So who is our narrator? Why is her grammar so bad? What story does she have to tell us?Mary B. Addison.When Mary was only 9 years old she was convicted of killing a baby. The baby was in the care of her mother and the details of the death are hazy and confused. When Mary is accused, she doesn\u2019t speak. She refuses to answer questions or talk at all to detectives. All they have is the testimony of Mary\u2019s mother and the evidence. While the evidence indicates there may be more to the story than meets the eye, Mary\u2019s refusal to speak leaves them with no choice. The story is told in parts. We get Mary\u2019s firsthand experience in the world of juvenile detention facilities. She refers to her first six years in the facility as \u201cbaby jail\u201d. She was released to a halfway house of sorts for children who have committed crimes. The girls in this house are violent and cruel. While the house is meant to be a means of rehabilitating these girls, the \u201cwardens\u201d within it are worse than the criminals. They are aware of the goings-on and yet refuse to intervene. They do nothing to help aide these girls in their attempts to better themselves- merely mocking and demeaning the girls at every turn. Mary is far from innocent. She is allowed out to work at a nearby hospital where she tends to the elderly. She sneaks off with her boyfriend, Ted, who is 2 years her elder and also housed at a detention facility for criminal youth. And Mary is pregnant with Ted\u2019s baby.Mary decides that the only way for her to keep her baby is to convince her mother to tell the truth about what happened that night when Mary allegedly killed the baby. The events in this book were frustrating to me as a reader. It seemed to take forever for the author to get to the point and tell us what happened. Instead we get the everyday mundane rituals of the halfway house, underdeveloped side characters and the confusion of what actually occurred that resulted in the death of a baby. I felt the ending was garbage. After reading almost 400 pages I expected something much better than what I was given. And I didn\u2019t care for a single person in the book. To me, there is no worse feeling than not having a single character to pull for, or stand behind. Mary\u2019s refusal to say outright what happened annoyed me. At the very least let the reader know. It was uneventful and I found myself bored more than once. If you want to read the great review that led to me reading this book you may do so here.
