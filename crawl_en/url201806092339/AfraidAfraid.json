I might as well be honest about that. Also happy ever afters. Further, in the interests of full disclosure, you should know that I read AFRAID by Jack Kilborn (with a view to a review) because Joe Konrath dared me to do so.He has a thick skin, and a strong stomach... and anyone who reads AFRAID needs both.This is not a book to take on a fishing trip, especially if you've left your loved ones at home, alone. In fact, this book ought to come with a free membership of the NRA. You'll want your Brinks alarm turned on, and a loaded shotgun under your mattress if you read AFRAID in bed at night. You might want one of those panic button pendants, too.Be warned. It is gruesome. AFRAID is the sort of book to be read aloud, in a large group. Maybe journalists who need to be kept up all night --for a slow-to-break story on Airforce One, for instance-- or secret types on a stakeout, would get a bang out of AFRAID.The villains are seriously, SERIOUSLY, nasty. My own most horrible villain (Insufficient Mating Material) rendered his victims insensible, had his wicked way, then took a small plug of pubic hair for a souvenir. Jack Kilborn's baddies do a great deal more than that. You get a sense of the horrors to come when a faceless bad guy sits on his first victim's bed, and when she asks what he's going to do to her, he says \"Everything.\"And that's just page 7.Jack Kilborn is exceptionally readable. His prose is clear, elegant, vivid, and intelligent.

He could be living anywhere. Possibly near you Considering what he writes, that is a very scary thought.Fortunately, I do know where he lives. He resides in the body of author J. A. Konrath. During the day he is harmless. But at night, he sneaks out and makes Mr. Konrath write these deliciously disgusting little books. Or at least that is the way I imagine it.The one thing that is clear is that Kilborn is not for everyone. Afraid is a non-stop action/horror novel that is waist-deep in blood and violence. It is also very creative and very witty in a droll sick way. The basic plot features an invasion of a Wisconsin town by a special forces team from Hell, figuratively speaking. What they are after and who will survive is the mystery. If you like action and horror you will get a satisfying double dose. If you don't, I understand The Help is available on DVD."}, {"userName": "Blake Crouch", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52535740-blake-crouch", "userReview": "AFRAID is a bungee jump into pure terror, a story that plays brilliantly on all our primal fears, and stands shoulder to shoulder with the very best of Harris, Koontz, and King.

While this novel is touted as horror, I see it more of a horror/action hybrid that travels at an unrelenting pace, and is inhabited by likeable heroes and vile villains. Set during one harrowing evening, Afraid pits the citizens of the sleepy Wisconsin Northwood's town of Safe Haven against a special forces unit programmed (with implanted computer chips and chemical enhancements) to torture, maim and kill whoever gets in their way. How and why are these trained killers let loose on the unsuspecting town? That answer lies in the land of spoiler alerts, and I won't tread that line in this mini review. Rest assured, the Safe Haven citizenry--average citizens who could reside in any American town--rise up and fight back against this Goliath-like enemy. While I generally shun spoilers, I will warn readers about becoming too attached to these likeable characters. Like I said, the pace of Afraid is relentless, and there are casualties along the way--even the fleshed out characters you can imagine settling down to a good long life are at risk of untimely demise. Recommended for horror and/or thriller fans."}, {"userName": "Ophelia Julien", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2133674-ophelia-julien", "userReview": "Jack Kilborn knows that a small town in America's heartland is the perfect place to set a horror thriller: remote, surrounded by shadowy woods, and sparsely populated by residents who still live by an unlocked-door policy. After reading this book, residents of small towns everywhere will be locking their doors with deadbolts and going to bed with .357 Magnums under their pillows. I know I would.The evil that descends upon this town, literally, in a helicopter, is motivated by the worst of all nightmares: inflicting pain and death for the sheer enjoyment of it. Sure, there is an agenda behind it all, but the reader realizes pretty quickly that the agenda is secondary to the basic goals of pain and death, in that order. And pain is dispersed among the townspeople in spectacularly grisly fashion. Mr. Kilborn is very good at visiting every possible nightmare from biting to stabbing, from burning to drowning, dismemberment to electric shock, with unremitting darkness and the occasional bout of claustrophobia thrown into the mix. One can almost picture Kilborn sitting at his keyboard and rubbing his hands in cackling glee as he speeds from one ghastly vision to the next. This is not to say that the entire book is nothing but gore. The reason this book succeeds so well is that beneath the surface layer of horror is a tight, strong, well-founded story that follows the path of three (and a half) unlikely heroes as they battle not only to survive but to overcome the monstrosity that has derailed their lives. The fact that all of them have been clothed in very real flesh and blood by the author will keep the reader turning pages to see what happens next, because you will care what befalls each of them.If you are seeking a page-turner that will have you switching on more lights as darkness descends and will linger in your mind long after you've reached the end, then AFRAID is the book for you. Just do yourself a favor and try to read it when you can consume it in one gulp. It's that good."}, {"userName": "Veronica Morfi", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5510829-veronica-morfi", "userReview": "Rating: 5/5OH MY GOD THIS BOOK!!! I have no words... but I'll try to find some, just so I can write a review.Afraid is the first book by Jack Kilborn/J.A. Konrath that I've ever read, and let me tell you it's not going to be the last. I was in the perfect mental state for a book like Afraid. I really wanted to read something action packed, with a military experiment gone bad, and a group of people trying to survive. And Afraid was exactly that, plus it was terrifying and totally gory, which I adored. So, in Afraid the small town of Safe Haven gets a surprise visit from a group of physically enhanced soldiers, created to bring mayhem and distraction, when a helicopter crashes near the town. None of the people has the slightest idea what is going on or why those people are suddenly after them. And what originally looks like a military mission gone bad, may turned out to be exactly what was planned for the little town. This book as insane. So much action, never a boring moment, always someone's life in immediate danger, there was so much death and fights and running from the enemy, it was really insane, beautifully insane. The first few chapters were the most terrifying thing I've ever read, and I read them at night, right before sleep. The story is very addicting, once I had the book in my hands I couldn't stop reading.I loved the characters, even the bad guys, there all just gave life to the story. Seeing them suffer and run for their lifes kept me on edge for the whole book. My favorite one has to be Duncan, the little kid involved in the story, he was pretty amazing for a kid. If things like that happened to me when I was his age, I'd just hide under bed until the bad guys found me. Anyways, this is an amazing story. It has a movie sense about it. I could picture everything going on. But be warned, it is not for younger readers. There is so much torture and gore, that I would only recommend this to adults only and not the fainthearted ones."}, {"userName": "Tressa ", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/226335-tressa", "userReview": "Safe Haven, Wisconsin.

I really cared about the characters and was rooting for the small group of people (and scene-stealing Woof) fighting the evil that had come to their town. Nothing supernatural going on here, just a horrifying thriller.

Much like the works of Jim Butcher and David Morrell, Kilborn\u2019s premiere work, AFRAID, is non-stop tension. Each section break, while short, somehow manages to ratchet up the suspense to the point that you wonder how much more you can take. You won\u2019t want to put the book down once you start it and a small part of you will wonder what possessed you to pick it up in the first place. The story is a non-stop horror ride\u2026once on, you can\u2019t get off.The story centers on Safe Haven, Wisconsin, a small town that prefers its privacy over even economic depression. Snowbirds flee south for the winter, leaving the 900+ full-time residents to their quiet, peaceful place of fishing and relaxation. That is, until what appears to be a helicopter crash ignites a world of trouble for every one of the town\u2019s 900 inhabitants.The main characters are 70-year-old Sheriff Streng, three weeks from retirement, Josh VanCamp, a young firefighter dealing with the loss of his fianc\u00e9 and the desire to save people as a paramedic-in-training and Fran Stauffer, a single mother whose husband had earlier been killed in a traffic accident, leaving her and their ten-year-old son, Duncan, emotionally scarred. Through their eyes (and half-a-dozen other peripheral characters), we witness the horrors that can befall those unprepared. The attacks, when they come, are lightning quick\u2026yet seem to last for hours. Gripping stuff!From page one of AFRAID, author Kilborn grabs the reader and refuses to let go. The story slowly, methodically unfolds even as the body count rises. The gruesome factor rises exponentially as the story heads toward its violent climax, but the real horror, the real suspense, comes from those scenes where the information is doled out in tidbits, allowing the mind to fill in the gaps\u2026and it is guaranteed that those gaps will eventually be filled with the most awful things imaginable. It is to Kilborn\u2019s credit, however, that he manages to come up with horrors that make even the unimaginable feel tame.The antagonists, (yes, there are multiple baddies), gain brief moments of humanity before they are snuffed out by the monsters they\u2019ve become. There are moments of pure beauty, selfless heroism and several scenes that, were this to be a movie, would illicit screams of pandemonious glee and gut-wrenching terror. AFRAID, as a novel, does pretty much the same thing. It is exhausting. I didn\u2019t want to put it down and yet, at the same time, I wanted to fling it across the room and run screaming from it. The words are visceral. You can see the enemy approaching, smell the burning flesh, taste the blood, feel the knife slither across your skin and hear the sounds of your heart thumping madly in your chest. Yes, the book is that good.This may be Kilborn\u2019s first novel, but he writes with the assuredness of a seasoned veteran. That is not to say this is a perfect book. The characters are not as fully-rendered as I would have liked and the nasties felt, at first, contrived and dull. However, like a pro, Kilborn takes these quibbles and sets them aside, due mostly to the frenetic pace of his story, the bareness of his prose and, in the end, our personal desire to see good triumph over evil. The realization that we humans are capable of atrocities similar to what are revealed throughout this book permeate the soul long after the last words are read, much like mold over rotting food. It is a bitter pill to swallow, that we are capable of such great good and yet, perform such hideousness upon one another. Both sides of that coin get equal billing here.Get AFRAID and be afraid. Then hold on tightly for a ride you will both want to jump off\u2026and ride again and again."}, {"userName": "J.

After being told I needed to keep up with more contemporary horror writers a few years ago, I bought a selection of novels, Afraid included. Here's the first sentence:\"The hunter's moon, a shade of orange so dark it appeared to be filled with blood, hung fat and low over the mirror surface of Big Lake McDonald.\"In my opinion, this is all you need to read of the novel to know exactly how badly-written the rest is going to be. This novel has an average of four stars, and I'm always happy to hear that people enjoy reading--heaven knows we need more people reading. But I've read a lot of very good books and some very bad books, and there's just no way this gets more than one star. I found the characters flat, the story trite and, as I mentioned at the start, the writing abominable. I suppose I could say that the good news is there are no typos. Sure, why not, I didn't see any typos. Grammar? Well, look back at that first sentence. Sorry, you can't fill a shade of orange with blood, that's simply a badly-phrased sentence. And it's the first one in the book. (And yes, I managed to make my way through the entire book. I gave Jack Kilborn the benefit of the doubt. My doubts were justified.)There are a whole lot of really great books out there to read, and many more that are simply passable.

Now imagine controlling the human brain by electrical stimulation and making it function more like a computer. Forget years of study and practice, simply download information directly into a person\u2019s brain and, depending on the program, anyone can have any skill set desired. In Jack Kilborn\u2019s Afraid, \"transhumanistic neuropathology\" is the underlying concept behind the development of his modified soldiers, or \"Red-ops\". Government-sponsored terrorists, Red-ops are trained in all aspects of munitions, battle and war and they function as small strike forces with three goals: isolate, overpower and annihilate. Forget the ethical implications with this type of science and the type of ideal world this could possibly create, we\u2019re not reading Afraid to think, we\u2019re reading Afraid to be entertained and this book is loaded with entertainment. Kilborn provides that entertainment by taking things a couple of steps further. Rather than training regular military personnel as Red-ops, he gives us Hannibal Lector combined with Rambo with transhuman modifications. In other words, unstoppable human monsters. We see a team made up of death row inmates: psychopaths and sadists, and rather than isolate, overpower and annihilate, they torture, rape and murder. And they do it well. Now drop this team of scientifically engineered mutant maniacs into the sleepy town of Safe Haven, Wisconsin, population 907, and the result is\u2014 well, the result is something you\u2019re going to have to find out for yourself. Afraid is billed as horror, but for me this wasn\u2019t horror and I didn\u2019t find the story frightening. However, this was an amazingly tense thriller; a violent (maybe too extreme for some readers) page-turner of the highest order. The action starts quickly and aside from taking breaks to reveal more layers of the plot, doesn\u2019t let up until the end. If you\u2019re the type of reader who doesn\u2019t like to wait, you might want to start Afraid early in the day or early in the weekend because you're not going to want to put it down once you start.

Taylor reminded me so much of GR13 (Dolph Lundgren). Taylor preferring toes to ears and both psychotic killers before their brains were tinkered with.

The other 2 people were talking about what kind of fish they pulled out of the local lake. This sort of inappropriate narative was all through the book.

AFRAID is so downright guilelessly gripping and fast-paced that I read it in ONE sitting, and literally on the edge of my seat, not getting up even once!There were NO boring parts, and in fact the story barely gave breaks to catch breaths; I just needed to keep turning those pages in the hopes of bringing the tension to an end, and boy, was there tension.Page after page of unnerving, relentless suspense and with every paragraph passed, I wasn't sure how much more I could take. Or in other words, I was AFRAID.Another reviewer phrased it as \"I got sucked in on the first page and didn\u2019t come up for air until the end.\" - That about sums it up perfectly.The bad guys in this book are very, very, very bad guys, and they do some really, really, really bad things.So what is it about? Well, all you really need to know for now is that it starts with a helicopter carrying a secret Red-Ops team of super soldiers (government weapons) trained in psychological terror that crashes into a wooded area in Northern Wisconsin and unleashes those sick and twisted human monsters on a small, unknowing town to have their way with them.As other reviewers have mentioned, probably hundreds of times, this story contains a deluge of brutality and gore.Violence and blood flow liberally, and NOBODY is safe.While I don't exactly seek out books in the gore-fest genre, I am willing to read stories of substance and enigma. Although there is a lot of torture and slaughter of the very unfortunate residents in \"Safe Haven\", the story is also a thriller from the very first page that makes it hard to put down.I love themes of fighting evil, but there's nothing at all supernatural happening in these pages; this time the monsters here are simply horrifying humans that Safe Haven locals must try to outwit and defeat.If you think you can handle the gore, I do recommend this read, because horror aspects aside, there is really a great mystery to what is going on so much that this story comes off as cinematic in your head.And as might reasonably be expected when feeling concern for characters in a story, especially one filled with so much anticipation and non-stop thrills, I probably did utter a lot of unintelligible, apprehensive noises while I read it.AFRAID is a fun, horrific and original novel that is equal parts gruesome and intrigue, but when you pick it up to read it, you damn well better be strapped in for the shit that is about to go down.One thing I can promise, you will want to make sure all the doors in your home are locked."}, {"userName": "Space Out With Sci Fi in June The Haunted Reading Room", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7302570-space-out-with-sci-fi-in-june-the-haunted-reading-room", "userReview": "Review soon (this is one of the grossest books I've ever read, worse to me than reading about the My Lai Massacre or Argentine's Dirty War--but in the end, very well worth the reading. There's more than a couple of really shocking surprises I never saw coming. Thanks much to Author Adam Light for challenging me to try this for the second time-this time I made it through, and I'm glad!) PS: this is not a full review yetReview:Review of Afraid by Jack Kilborn5 stars\tThis book amazed me in that I was able to read it. I had tried in 2012, and only read the first chapter or so because I found it too violent. Another author challenged me to try again, and so I did, with gratitude because despite the cruelty and violence, I really did enjoy the book. I will specify that this novel is definitely not for either the faint of heart or the weak of stomach, and those who abhor \u201csplatterpunk\u201d should avoid it. That specified, I enjoyed it for the backstory, and for the several shocking surprises in which everything I thought I knew or guessed about the plot and the characters were overturned, and I found out how wrong I was. Yet it all fit together logically and believably.Mr. Kilborn (a pseudonym of author J. A. Konrath) is a multiply-published prolific author; he is also a very talented author. The writing in \u201cAfraid\u201d and its sequel \u201cTrapped\u201d (different plot line, mostly different characters, same region but different locale) is smooth and thrilling. This is a non-stop adventure/thriller/mystery."}, {"userName": "Kaisersoze", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22517400-kaisersoze", "userReview": "[willing to end a number of them in less than pleasant ways (hide spoiler)]"}], "description": "ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE DARK?
