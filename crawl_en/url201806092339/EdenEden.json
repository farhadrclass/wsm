As the story progresses the reader is led into a post apocalyptic world where the problems of the real world are still present and very much alive unlike the masses of infected outside the walls of Eden. We are also introduced to a few new species of zombies like the runners and brains.Juxtaposed into the storyline are excerpts of various back stories of the survivors from before the outbreak and how they came to be at Eden for the most part.The story reads well and holds your interest. There are very few issues with grammar and syntax or punctuation. The one very minor error that I was able to find related to spelling was a simple reference to giving something a wide birth whereas it should have been berth. As I said very minor and does nothing to detract from the overall storyline.Another minor issue is the collection of firearms that the survivors seem to have access to. Some of the weapons are quasi-exotic to really exotic and would be difficult if not impossible to procure within the US and especially within the state of New York where the story takes place.These exotics would include the South African Striker shotgun, outlawed in the US since 1986 mainly because it had an aggressive sounding name. I know, stupid reason but one worth noting. The US version was known as the Amsel Striker and was made by Sentinel Arms but is no longer produced. The Walther WA-2000, a very exotic bullpup configured sniper rifle that is very difficult to locate outside the UK and even there it\u2019s strictly a military issued rifle. The Spectre M4 submachine gun, a nice concept for a subgun but it has gone the way of HK\u2019s G11 and is no longer in mass production. While considered by some to be an excellent example of a 4th generation submachine gun, it has fallen to the wayside much like the Calico series of rifles and subguns.The use of these weapons within Eden in no way detracts or is detrimental to the storyline. In fact, most readers won\u2019t even realize what I pointed out if they didn\u2019t work in the firearms industry in some capacity. I only mention them from my perspective and knowledge base of weaponry.Having spoken to the author, it appears he likes to use exotic weapons as maybe a trademark in his writing based on his past reading of the 1980s-1990s Gold Eagle book titles, The Executioner, Able Team, Soldiers of Barabbas and others. I too was an avid reader of most of these titles and understand why Mr. Monchinski would want to include such firepower into his work as homage to the characters of Mack Bolan, Carl Lyon, Gadgets Schwartz, Pol Blancanales, weapon smith Konzaki and others.Overall, Eden is highly recommended as one of the best zombie apocalypse novels on the market and Mr. Monchinski has put out several sequels to the original. Eden far surpasses other novels in this genre and I personally look forward to more of Mr. Monchinski\u2019s work.Hey Tony, how about working in an AA12 into one of your books? You know Carl Lyons famous Atchison shotgun?"}, {"userName": "Felicia A", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1739957-felicia-a", "userReview": "I am shocked and awed, but I actually finished this book. This was no easy task for much of the book, and it took me a lot longer to read than it would have otherwise. The book is just SO poorly edited, that it's very difficult to follow. Having said that, if you can get past that, which is extremely difficult, it does 1) get better and 2) become worth it.As surprised as I was to have actually made myself overlook the poor editing and continue on with this book, I was just as surprised at how good the story actually is, and how much I am looking forward to reading the sequel, which I have already ordered."}, {"userName": "Patrick D'Orazio", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4328815-patrick-d-orazio", "userReview": "I read a lot of zombie fiction. Just take a gander at my reviews over the past couple of years on Amazon and you will see that 95% of them are zombie fiction. No, this is not all that I read, but typically it is what I review ever since I got on my zombie reading kick a couple of years ago. I have enjoyed zombie movies for many years but I have taken it upon myself to try to read as much zombie stuff as there is available via Amazon more recently. In this genre there are plenty of graphic novels, a small select group of mass market stuff, a wider array of product published by the likes of Permuted Press, which is a strong genre house that has produced some really solid zombie epics...and then there are the self published works. I have read many of those, even the ones that previous reviewers have given ample warning that I should not even be considering because of their horrible editing, uninteresting storyline and atrocious character development. I enjoy zombies enough that it seems not to matter at the outset; my craving for stories of the undead seemingly unsatiable, although I have to admit that I really regretted forging ahead with some of the really horrible self published garbage out there. Not here, not with this book. This one is definitely a keeper. I was hesitant at first. Why? Perhaps it is because of the my own confusion surrounding who wrote this book. It seems obvious that Tony Monchinski wrote the book, cops to it twice here on Amazon, but created an indepth fabrication as to who Tommy Arlin is. I was not sure about that but I can appreciate it as sort of the author's attempt at creating a pen name with a wink and a nod at the reader. Tony does a bang up job with this story. He does change the writing style part way through but while I got used to quick automatic beat of the words early on I was able to settle in to the more traditional way he writes further on. Our story centers around a high school principle named Harris who lives in NYC as the zombie plague breaks out. We follow him and numerous other folks that interact with him at one point or another, through his experiences after the zombies come and up to and beyond his time in Eden, a walled in fortress in Queens where a group of survivors are trying to survive and thrive as best they can. The story jumps backwards and forwards on different time tracks, giving us various perspectives and unveiling bits and pieces of the puzzle and mystery that is this story which starts out with our main character bitten and already cognizant that in less than 24 hours he will be dead and rising from the dead to become one of repulsive fiends he hates so much. This little tidbit is not giving away any secrets: we know within the first couple of sentences that Harris has been bit and we go from there. He wants to find out what human being allowed this to happen to him and get to them before he dies. The story is a bit disjointed with the shifting time frame that allows the author to reveal both minor and major details at his own pace, not allowing us to understand the whole truth of things until the very end. It is a bit confusing but I was certainly able to keep track of it all, enjoying the pace the storyteller was able to set. The author does a good job coming up with a few \"tweaks\" to the zombies themselves in addition to having a good story to tell. The undead can be slow, fast, screamers or silent and there are even a few \"brains\" amongst them, the true predators of the breed. They are smart enough to know how to hunt humans down more effectively and are, by far, the most disturbing of this new breed. If I were to be critical, it would be that we did not really get to see any of them in action during the book, or so it seemed. If you are going to create new varieties, use them. Not a big criticism by any means though. I thought the author did a great job in describing the rapid breakdown of New York with plausible military intervention and government reaction to such a unthinkable catastrophe. Individuals come and go in the book but are not treated as extras but rather as solid human beings even if their fate is an abrupt and painful one. It is clear that our author knows the city and knows its people and uses this knowledge to great advantage here. Solid character development, great tone and flow of story, and overall another worthwhile ride into the doomed world of the zombie apocalypse."}, {"userName": "Andrew Vachss", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2610991-andrew-vachss", "userReview": "Joe Lansdale once told me \"Charles de Lint is the only writer who could make me read about faeries.\" Put me down for the same my brother's having--only make mine Tony Monchinski and zombies."}, {"userName": "Kristen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1116185-kristen", "userReview": "If you are looking for a down and dirty Zombie novel, then look no farther. Provided of course that you can wade your way through multiple typos. The author has created almost the stereotypical architype of a zombie book. Masses of undead, survivors banding together, total government breakdown, slow zombies, fast zombies, loud zombies, good survivors and bad survivors - it's all here.The timeline leaps back and forth starting from within the walls of Eden, a santuary from the undead back to prior to the outbreak, then through various scenes of the pandemonium that followed. Some may dislike this format, I personally didn't mind it. The characters are very real, human, and flawed. Some are tortured by the loss of loved ones, others must deal with what they had to do to survive. The zombies in this book are what many zombie lovers would consider \"old school\" mindless shambling hoards of the undead.What is interesting is that even though there isn't a single aspect of this novel that has not been done or seen before, this book reads as an all new story. I would consider this a must have for your zombie library. When I previously referred to typos, and there are plenty of them they mainly involve a lack of spaces between words at times, and at other times the leaving off of the last letter of a word, example the word \"took\" turning into \"too.\" If you don't mind that then I highly recommend this book to the 15+ zombie fans.Rated R for gore, violence, language both profane and racist, no sex is shown but it is very strongly eluded to."}, {"userName": "Selena", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7304671-selena", "userReview": "This book has to be one of the best zombie books I have read, even if I haven't read that many, but I plan to and I'm going to be reading Blood Crazy by Simon Clark next.The fact that the chapters aren't in order makes the book just that much more enjoyable because you don'y know what's going to happen in the next chapter. The way the book is done, with the chapters being out of order, shows how life would be in an apocalypse. There are no rules or government or anything. This book is a perfect display of that.The characters are easy to like or dislike and some of them just stick with you. Tony Monchinski did a great job at the characters. None of them were the same, they were all different which is part of what makes the book good. All of the characters had something interesting about them and not really boring, so it made the book easier to read. The book has it's funny moments, sad moments, \"oh my god, I need to know what happens next!\" moments and many others. I look forward to reading the next book \"Crusade\" as I'm sure it will be just as enjoyable as the first one.This is definitely a must read for zombie lovers!

I have since discovered that there's a 2nd book, but since I'm sure it has the thinkers in it, I'm not going to read it. The main setting is a compound \"Eden\" where several survivors live and die.

It was great. Barnes and Noble has recommended me crap before (see The Forest of Hands and Teeth), but this one was an A+ choice. It catered to everything I loved in a zombie novel, plus some. (And, yes, I judge books by their covers.)Most of the story revolves around a man named Harris who is doomed to die from the very first line of the book. The rest of the book follows accordingly, taking the reader through the events of Harris\u2019 life and the people that surround him as they pertain to the apocalypse. Through snippets only pages long, Monchinski introduces a list of characters and places that define the corner of New York known as Eden\u2014a colony of survivors scraping by within the confines of two blocks of former suburbia.It\u2019s amazing what was fit into just over 300 pages of work. I can\u2019t really say I was invested in the characters, because I wasn\u2019t. I was invested in the story. I felt like an observer watching these characters go about their daily lives (Creepy? Yeah.) and I felt an impact when one of them died, but I always wanted to know how it was going to end.There were more than a few graphic scenes. It\u2019s a zombie novel, and Monchinski beat that undead horse for all it was worth. There was just enough description to make my stomach lurch in the most pleasant way possible.Not only were there shamblers, but sprinkled throughout were other zombies\u2014sprinters, lurkers, howlers. There were even times when the characters would come across a zombie that had no interest in the living, which was a nice touch.The only problem I had with this book\u2014and, when I got to the end, I considered it a minor one\u2014was the fact that each chapter was at a different time in Harris\u2019 experience and some were from the perspective of other characters completely. It takes some getting used to, and as events unfold it\u2019s easy to get the minor characters confused.All in all, Eden is spectacularly written and beautifully plotted with an ending that made me want to punch somebody. It\u2019s not the best zombie book I\u2019ve ever read, but it\u2019s easily in the top five. It\u2019s not an all-purpose, recommend-this-to-everybody zombie novel like World War Z, but zombie lovers will enjoy it.High five, Tony Monchinski, I will definitely be buying the sequel."}, {"userName": "Pete Aldin", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7239631-pete-aldin", "userReview": "Terrible. I abandoned this book at page 61, after forcing myself to read those last 30 pages or so.I am gobsmacked this book has as high a rating as it does. It is a shame I hated it, because the first chapter had me hooked. But from Chapter 2 (not that the chapters have numbers), it annoyed the hell out of me...The narrative timeline jumps all over the place for no discernible reason. Point of view characters appear, get us to know them, then die. Somewhere amidst the chaos of out-of-sync flashbacks there are snippets of the story we're promised in the blurb (Harris solving his own murder before the time runs out, which would have been facinating), but it's not enough. Not nearly enough. Especially when I have to sit through a whole chapter of people sitting around discussing junk food. Who cares?????And don't get me started on the abysmal neglectful approach to editing that both the author and the publisher have taken. Entire chapters appear to have been skipped by both. Wordsrun togetherlike this. Whole paragraphs lack a single verb, which may be a literary device, but just reads like someone wrote it in a hurry. Other things happen to jolt you out of the story such as the fellow sitting in his cell, then standing outside it, then sitting back inside it again -- all without moving. Here's a sample, typed verbatim: \"When rummage expeditions for canned goods and supplies Harmon always kept an eye out for another flick to add to his library.\" (When rummage what?). A few lines down on the same page: \"Mickey's living room had beenconverted\" -- there's those words stuck together again. Scrivener has a habit of doing this when you compile your manuscript: a good reason to actually edit it.Sigh.Usually I don't give reviews to books I hate, putting my lack of interest down to a difference in taste. But this book annoyed me. I am irritated a publisher got it out there into bookshops. I am irritated people I trust told me to buy this. And more irritated I could have spent the $25 on something much much better.

While, I don\u2019t really judge a book by its cover, I admit that the cover for this book was a bit corny and so, I thought the story would be as well. Nope, the story was better than I expected it to be. While, there were some flaws, I did find myself drawn to the main character Harris. He was just a normal guy, trying to survive. He was smart and had a good personality. Some of the other characters I did find uninteresting and this did take away from the story. On that note, there was a lot of jumping around between the time lines of past and present and many different characters coming at me that in beginning I was confused. The transfer involving the past and the present was not smooth at all. I do have to give props that there is plenty of action. Right away from page one, the reader finds Harris and his wife, Julie fighting for their lives as their home is invaded by flesh-eating, brain-sucking zombies.

I found that I don't like the gore in your typical zombie novel. People getting their guts ripped out, being dismembered, or otherwise being ingested by the living dead is just not for me. Also, I expected a bit more social commentary or something rather than just an all-action story. There was some of this, but it remained relatively hidden. Some more came out at the end, which, as with so many series, is what actually compels me to find the next book. I did enjoy the characterizations. They were complex - some were never even fully explained - and well-developed. I found Harris' characterization as a tough survivor but still committed to living well and pursuing lasting relationships refreshing from many other similar novels, too. Though I was at times a bit confused with the nonlinear storyline, flashing between characters, events, and dates every chapter, I thought it added more depth to the development of the overall plot. I'm definitely looking forward to finding out more about this zombie apocalypse and its survivors in the sequel, Crusade.Disclaimer: I received my copy of this book from the publisher in return for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Mary (BookHounds)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1378745-mary-bookhounds", "userReview": "MY THOUGHTSREALLY LIKED IT The earth has been devastated by a disease that turns humans into zombies that crave human flesh and a core group of characters, some neighbors, some traveling from safe site to site across the North East of the United States try to band together to form a community in order to exist. The story centers around Harris who dreams of a zombie free life once again and reminisces about the past with the new citizens of a walled in area that protects them from the invading hoards. The story focuses on the small day to day interactions and the horror that has become their survival. When Harris finds himself bitten he knows he is infected with the disease that will soon turn him zombie. I found it fascinating that he goes through all of the grief stages, much like a terminal cancer patient. He also refers to three types of zombies: walkers, sprinters and thinkers. The thinkers are few, while the sprinters are the scariest. Most of the action in the story is trying to get away from the invading zombies and killing them with a shot to the head.

I really enjoyed it, but one thing bothered me. The book flips from different time periods after every chapter. This in itself would not be so bad, but there aren't any dates to let you know what the setting of the chapter is. Sometimes new characters are introduced and you have to keep reading to find out the time relation of this chapter to the present. It also slowed the pacing of the main story. At times it was confusing, but I did get used to it. One benefit of this method was that it allowed the author to go back in time and show how some things came to be. This was especially effective for the ending.There are some very intense, action-packed scenes in this book. A couple of my favourites are the drugstore raid and operation kitten rescue. Not a book for the squeamish. I'm a jaded horror reader, but there were parts of this novel that made me go \"ugh\". There are some sequels to this book.

In fact, it is fairly standard for the genre. Essentially it follows a group of characters, mostly one, that have created a safe haven (Eden) in the middle of the zombie apocalypse. We can deduce Eden as being somewhere in New York, but it is not actually defined.The book suffers from one major flaw, but is redeemed by its innovative take on the zombies themselves. The zombies are a combination of the various classic cannibal corpses - slow shamblers that overwhelm their prey - but also combining the newer fast zombies, and with a nod towards the smart zombies of the later post-zombie inundation styling. However, while this gives both a nuance to the world of the novel, and allows for interesting plot developments, the book doesn't really use them to great effect. Yet, the major flaw of this novel is the scattered thread of the plot. We begin the novel in Eden when the zombies have broken in, but after this first chapter, we bounce back and forth between our main characters timeline in such a way that it becomes impossible to keep track of which events take place when, aside from certain key moments (meeting of characters/death of characters). In addition, scattered into this labyrinthine narrative are random tidbits from people who are just in the zombie apocalypse. Unfortunately, these narrative decisions pull us away from the overall story and ultimately leave us wanting some form of consistency. In fact, the final chapters don't fit with the early story line at all, and almost feel as if they were added as sequel bait - of which there are a number of novels.Basically, if you like zombie novels you will enjoy this book as I did, but will be frustrated by the inconsistency in the story. If however, you are a casual reader of the genre you may find many things to interesting, but you will most likely not enjoy the novel overall."}, {"userName": "Submarine", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/82793732-submarine", "userReview": "This is what zombie novels were meant to be. Any fans of post-apocalyptic and zombie literature need to pick up a copy of this immediately. Well-written, dark, well-paced, and interest-holding. What else is needed?

Originally I thought it was written with numerous flashbacks but I think it is more written in a non-linear fashion, bouncing back and forth in time. I once read a book-writing novel by Dean Koontz that said you should have your hero in peril in the first 3 pages. This book succeeds in doing that in the first sentence. this is the reason I think the book is written the way it is. It starts with our hero Harris waking up to a zombie attack. The book then goes back and forth from the \"current\" storyline following the aftermath of the attack and Harris's pursuit of the individual that enabled the attack on his home and the flashbacks going back to the beginnings of the zombie outbreak, Harris's meeting with Buddy, their initial days in Eden and so forth. However, even those are not written in order. It almost appears as if the author wrote the chapters in linear order and then said, I'm going to start with the attack (chapter 20 in the \"original\" draft) and end with this chapter (chapter 19), now let's mix up the rest of them in between. It is a bit annoying because you bounce all over the place and it takes a minute to figure out if you are in the current timeline (relative to the first chapter) or somewhere in the past.Another reason I think the order is jumbled is because the events from Harris's attack to finding his \"killer\" and dealing with him, are not all that interesting or eventful. They are actually rather mundane. which means if the book would have started with that point, the story wouldn't have gone very far and if it would have been in linear fashion, the last quarter of the book would have been really dull.Given it's format, it turned out pretty decent but is far from being one of the best zombie novels out there as it is billed. Other than the non-linear fashion, it's rather straight forward and average."}], "description": "Overnight the world transforms into a barren wasteland ravaged by plague and overrun by hordes of flesh-eating zombies. A small band of desperate men and women stand their ground in a fortified compound in what had once been Queens, New York. They've named their sanctuary Eden. Harris--the unusual honest man in this dead world--races against time to solve a murder while fighting to maintain his own humanity. Ultimately, the danger posed by the dead and diseased masses clawing at Eden's walls pales in comparison to the deceit and treachery Harris faces within.", "title": "Eden\n      \n          (Eden #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3619400-eden", "average": 3.79, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347488986l/3619400.jpg", "reviews": 64, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2898869.Tommy_Arlin", "name": "Tommy Arlin"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1402051.Tony_Monchinski", "name": "Tony Monchinski"}], "type": ["Horror", "Horror", "Science Fiction", "Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3619400-eden", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3313983-eden", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6399342-eden", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9792728-eden", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11573879-eden---a-zombie-novel"]}
