Roslyn is married to film star Malin Lovgren. Marlin is found murdered. Ewan Strachan, the Scottish journalist, finds his trip to Sweden turns into a nightmare. Anita Sundstrom, divorcee and blunt Swede, is brought in to investigate. Who would want to kill Marlin Lovgren?This had a very old fashioned feel to it. A kind of Agatha Christie style mystery, with a well crafted lead in Anita Sundstrom. There were a few red herrings, thrown in for good measure.

I will read the second one. I liked it that much. Why then the two stars? Because of the completely ridiculous ending. The scene of the final struggle is (literally) over the top and too improbable to accept. That's the first thing. The other is that, while I like a twist at the end, this twist I just did not believe. There was no preparation for it in any way and I ended up just shrugging my shoulders and deciding I just didn't care enough to go back through the book and see if there was any clue at all. I do like Anita Sundstrom, though, and hope to see her develop further, and kick her snus habit (very unappealing)."}, {"userName": "Liz Barnsley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16471876-liz-barnsley", "userReview": "Enjoyable crime romp featuring new detective on the block Anna Sundstrom, entertaining throughout with some great characters. Yes a certain amount of suspension of disbelief is required, most especially with regards to the ending, but overall very good indeed.The strength in this story comes from the two main characters \u2013 Ewan is slightly hapless, when he seizes the opportunity to use old ties to secure a decent interview he ends up embroiled in murder. Anna, the detective on the case is an extremely credible character with surprisingly few issues \u2013 she is what she is and she does what she does. Refreshing that the author didnt feel the need to resort to cliche. The interaction between these two formed a great backdrop for the events of the novel \u2013 their growing relationship giving a nice little sub plot to sink your teeth into.The mystery element is well drawn \u2013 some great little twists and turns in there, cleverly done and keeps you turning the pages. Yes ok the end I think will divide opinion but for the most part it was solid and highly readable, a great new addition to the crime genre.Overall then pretty terrific.

The book opens with the apparent suicide of a young female student at Durham University, from where the story moves forward twenty five years and we first encounter Ewan Strachan, a less than talented journalist working for a tinpot local magazine in the North East of England. Getting wind of Strachan\u2019s former involvement at university with a high-profile film director, Mick Roslyn, now based in Sweden, Strachan is despatched, not altogether unwillingly, to Malmo to interview Roslyn, and Roslyn\u2019s glamorous wife, the actress Malin Lovgren. However, Strachan quickly comes to the attention of Swedish detective Anita Sundstr\u00f6m and her team when he stumbles upon a murder scene- Roslyn\u2019s wife has been strangled and Strachan is put firmly in the place of chief suspect. As the investigation progresses, however, Sundstr\u00f6m becomes increasingly attracted to the unprepossessing figure of Strachan, and proving his innocence has serious ramifications for our intrepid detective. And just what are Roslyn and Strachan concealing about their university years?I think the first thing to say about this book is that I enjoyed the characterisation very much, both of hapless journalist Ewan Strachan, and of MacLeod\u2019s keynote detective Anita Sundstr\u00f6m. Strachan was portrayed as a wonderfully underperforming, unfulfilled waster, who let\u2019s face it would never get within an inch of a Pulitzer for his journalistic output. I thoroughly enjoyed his seeming lack of confidence when Sundstr\u00f6m begins to take a more than professional interest in him, and his whole little-boy-lost demeanour as he struggles to get to grips with both his potential involvement in a murder, and the trials of dealing with this in a strange country. Equally, Sundstr\u00f6m played a significant part in my enjoyment of the book, not being too weighed down with the usual cliches that attach themselves to female detectives, and for the most part carrying a credibility about her character throughout. I was slightly perturbed with the building romantic involvement between herself and Strachan, but think that MacLeod largely succeeded in the believability of their growing attraction. He handled the balance of Sundstr\u00f6m\u2019s professional investigation and character well with a sub-storyline that could have caused all manner of pitfalls. Generally, the plot was well played out, and as the events of past and present became more intertwined, my attention was kept focussed by the slow reveal of the skeletons in Strachan\u2019s and Roslyn\u2019s past. However, I would slightly take issue with the ending, as I did experience a growing feeling of \u2018oh- he\u2019s not going to do that at the end is he?\u2019- as the murderer is revealed. Maybe my prolific crime reading has bitten me on the bum again as I did feel a little dissatisfaction with the denouement.It\u2019s always interesting to see how a non-native author depicts a country and its residents based on an outsider\u2019s experience, as MacLeod is a Scot by birth, but obviously has a comprehensive and affectionate knowledge of his Swedish setting. Tempered by the interesting depiction of some very familiar locations to me in the North East of England, it would be fair to say that he achieves this well. My only criticism would be that sometimes, I did feel a little more immersed in his detailed travelogue than was strictly necessary, and that the level of detail he applies to the Swedish locations did feel a little too in depth at times, at the expense of driving the plot forward more quickly, and as we entered another network of streets and buildings, I did lose interest slightly. However, I did accrue some little nuggets of local information that could make me look more interesting at social gatherings, so all was not lost.In fairness, much of this book worked when looked at as a whole, and as a pre-cursor to my reading of further books in the series, garnered enough of my interest to see how the series progresses. I\u2019m always keen to discover new Scandinavian set crime so MacLeod is another good find to add to my list.

I'm not being petty either. It's really miserable but it could have been good, it had all the right elements but it falls down early on in the piece and never seems to recover. The synopsis sounds good. A Scottish journalist, Ewan, now living in England meets up with an old university pal, Mick, who's now a film producer in Sweden and married to a gorgeous Swedish actress. He invites him to Malmo to interview him and the wife but when Ewan gets there he finds the wife dead and he is a prime suspect after Mick discovers him leaning over his dead wife. After he is ruled out of the investigation other suspects emerge, including a connection to Sapo and the murder of Olaf Palme. Ewan has fallen head over heels in love with Inspector Anita Sundstrom and surprise, surprise, she is starting to fall for an overweight, middle aged Scottish journalist. Why am I not surprised?What bugged me initially was the same thing that annoyed other reviewers, the over emphasis on Anita's beauty, she's an atypical Swedish beauty, but then we get into day to day conversation in English between Anita and her colleagues, which is perfectly okay but having them using terms like wanker and tosser, just don't work unless your novel is set in the U.K or you've got a British national working as a policeman in Malmo. The overall conversation seems to be inspired more by those tedious BBC cop shows and simply transplanted into the novel.Anita is supposed to be an experienced detective, with the rank of Inspector but the way she's portrayed in the book you'd think she was just a rookie cop, a bundle of nerves and what she puts up with from male colleagues doesn't even make sense. This is Sweden for Christ's sake not some backwater hick small town in America. If he wanted some Swedish inspiration then watching The Bridge might have provided some better inspiration than this flighty, sometimes cool, fabulously beautiful woman who really can't stop falling in love with one of her suspects.The sense of place is probably the only thing I liked, MacLeod obviously had some local knowledge but the character development is appalling and seems tacked on with only a half baked idea of character arcs. The ending is absolutely idiotic, in fact skip to the end of the book and save yourself the trouble of wading through an entire book. There was no foreshadowing, just this man who everyone thought was innocent until big surprise he turns out to be the murderer and the book ends with me thinking okay what was all that about? It reminds of that last scene in Basic Instinct where the camera drops down to the ice pick while the former suspect is screwing the cop who was investigating her for murder. The ending in this book treats the reader like an idiot.This book could have been better with more work on character development and arcs. If, like me, you do write crime then this is probably a good example of a first draft that needed to be rewritten, in fact I've got several drafts of my current novel, none of which will ever see the light of day because I rewrite and rewrite and rewrite again until the story comes to life. Use this book as a teaching tool to learn how not to write crime and an example of tedious tropes.I gave this one star but it really deserves half a star because even that is being generous."}, {"userName": "Linda Root", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20450380-linda-root", "userReview": "This book started out as a strong five. I was elated with the early pages and captivated by the way the plot was evolving. Then, by the time I was 2/3 of the way to the end, it started to slide and settled down to a four, and by the end, it was so disappointing I am giving it a *** +. The quality of the writing makes it a better than average read, but the characters become less believable and far less likeable as the story progresses. There are a few too many twists and turns and the end is way too 'camp' to be credible. I spent 23 years prosecuting major crimes and worked with investigators of varied skill, some less professional than others, but in this novel the entire police force of Malmo is a crew of Keystone cops without the humor. Torquil MacLeod as a writer is rich with talent and promise--but he needs to write his protagonist into another line of work. Because this is his first in a series, I may go back for the next book just to find out how the myopic female investigator manages to survive in law enforcement.

When he discovers the directors glamorous film star wife dead in her apartment, the Sk\u00e5ne County Police are called in to solve the high-profile case. Among the investigating team is Inspector Anita Sundstr\u00f6m, who soon finds the list of suspects growing. As Anita battles to discover the answers amid the antagonism of some of her colleagues, she even begins to think that the person she is becoming attracted to could be the murderer.-------------My take..I've not read any Scandinavian set crime fiction for well over a year and this one was slightly unusual insofar as the author, Torquil MacLeod is an English-based Scotsman.We start with a seemingly unconnected incident 25 years ago, where a young student falls to her death from Durham Cathedral. Present day, we pick up with a journalist, Ewan Strachan. Strachan\u2019s in a dead-end job, but a chance opportunity to interview former university friend and now successful Swedish film director, Mick Roslyn sees him flying off to Malmo. On the morning of his appointment with Mick, Strachan discovers Roslyn\u2019s film star wife, Malin Lovgren dead in their flat \u2013 murdered.This now introduces us to the other main foil in our story \u2013 Swedish detective, Anita Sundstrom. Sundstrom we soon discover is attractive, capable and slightly disorganised in her personal life as well as single. She\u2019s a slightly under-valued member of the investigative team. Her boss, Erik Moberg is a bit of a chauvinist, with a sometimes bull-dozing and blinkered approach to investigations\u2026\u2026locate suspect, decide likelihood of guilt, assemble facts to support hypothesis and discount other avenues of enquiry. Sundstrom offers a more considered, balanced approach to the investigation.Strachan, also a person of interest as he discovered the victim, manages to upgrade his journalistic gig with his newspaper to that of temporary crime reporter as the story breaks back in his home town and his editor keeps him in Malmo. Strachan\u2019s fascination and attraction to Anita makes his prolonged assignment an attractive one.The investigation brings added pressure, given the high profile identity of the victim. Inquiries indicate that Roslyn\u2019s wife was subject to the unwelcome attentions of a stalker. Further digging in the direction of her husband, opens up other possibilities \u2013 a project Mick was working threatened to throw an unwelcome spotlight on the still unsolved murder of Swedish prime minister, Olof Palme back in the mid-80\u2019s and the possible involvement of extreme\u2019s elements within the police service. Additionally Mick had been playing away from home with his business partner\u2019s girlfriend. Was Mick\u2019s affair serious enough to drive him to murder and was he setting up his old friend, Strachan into the bargain. Did his partner suspect Roslyn\u2019s dalliances and exact a twisted revenge? Plenty of possibilities for motive and murder. I must admit, I was undecided as to the perpetrator and MacLeod skilfully kept me guessing until the end and the reveal.Great setting with an interesting mix of characters and a bit of police politics thrown in, with some bristly characters butting heads. Enough of Sundstrom\u2019s personal life was offered to make her more than just a detective and someone this reader warmed to and liked. Our other main character, Strachan was interesting and sympathetic and the way they interacted with each other, especially as Ewan felt an attraction to Anita added another layer of intrigue to an extremely enjoyable mystery.There\u2019s more to come from Torquil MacLeod and his Swedish detective Sundstrom in the future with additional books appearing soon.

Yes, Ewan Strachan never has reached his full potential, but he's a bit of a charmer, and it's easy to forgive him a failure or two. In fact, the reader wants him to make a complete success of his interview with the famous film director and his beautiful movie star wife-- after all, Ewan's got the inside track, doesn't he? In her own way, Inspector Anita Sundstr\u00f6m is just as appealing. She's a bit of a loner, having tired of the dating scene, and she's dedicated, hardworking, and just doesn't know when to quit.If you like mysteries with more twists and turns than Lombard Street in San Francisco, Meet Me in Malm\u00f6 is the book for you. I had an idea about the killer's identity from the very beginning, and I enjoyed seeing how that idea held up as the pages turned. As good as the plot twists were, I have to say that the ending-- with that last shocking volte-face-- was very abrupt. It almost felt as though the author had written one very long novel and decided that this was the best place to divide his manuscript into two books. Some readers may be put off by that ending, but it made me want to read book number two.Do you enjoy crime fiction set in Scandinavia?

This book, the first in a \u201cnew\u201d series of Anita Sandstr\u00f6m novels, is clumsily written and translated and the characters are all pretty much plastic. The lead is the usual tall Scandinavian blond, single and horny, the plot is predictable until the last page when it becomes stupid and the male characters are all \u201ctypes\u201d: Erik Moberg is obese, pushy and dunder-headed. He makes mistake after mistake and never apologizes for himself. The worst character is a cop named Karl Westmark, a foul-mouthed sexist who is thoroughly and stupidly in capable of civil discourse if there is a woman around. He, predictably, tries to hit on Anita to no avail. She is she is busy contemplating a toss in the hay with a reporter, Ewan Strachan, a Scotsman, in Malm\u00f6 ostensibly to interview an old classmate at college, Mick Roslyn, a famous film director. Shortly after he arrives Roslyn\u2019s wife, Malin Lovgren, turns up dead. The natural suspect, Roslyn, later takes a dirt nap as well and things get rowdy. Throughout, MacLeod awkwardly describes events, actions and characters: \u201cThere was a further silence as they absorbed this permutation,\u201d he says of new evidence: \u201cHe didn\u2019t feed himself properly, she concluded. The she chided herself for thinking like a mum when she should be thinking like a cop.\u201d Awkward stuff like the preceding pops up all over the novel. Another weakness is a character that sometimes serves as narrator who turns out to be a liar. This person tells lies in the narration but the reader doesn\u2019t find out until the very end that he/she is lying. The character throws red herrings all over the landscape that turn out to be meaningless except that we readers are kept in the dark and not allowed to interpret the testimony he/she gives until the last four words in the novel. The whole practice smacks of literary cheating and made me resent the book even more than the awkward writing had already done.

The first of a series introducing the female detective Anita Sundstr\u00f6m.

Whilst he is there, the directors wife is murdered, and the leggy blonde Anita is part of the investigating team. We are exposed to much of the dysfunction of Swedish police, involving bullies, sex pests, and unprofessional conduct; much more bullying in the ranks of journalists in North East England; and an analysis of the cultural differences between the UK and Sweden through the eyes of our journalist. I hope/imagine the quality of the plots gets better as the series progresses. The most interesting aspects of the plot concerned an attempt to weave in the role of the Swedish secret service in the murder of Olof Palme in 1986 - the director was making a film on this subject when his wife was killed.

I struggled to complete this book but the ending was just too much!! I will not waste my time on any more of this series. Stick to Jo Nesbo or Henning Mankell. They know how to write engaging and realistic crime fiction in the Scandinavian region! Too bad Steig Larsson died before completing the next three books in his series."}, {"userName": "O", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60030613-o", "userReview": "Fairly well-written and interesting book, with a lot of local knowledge added - nice for anyone who knows something about it - although the very many spelling mistakes and typos are annoying. How difficult can it be to have a competent editor checking it, and, in this case, anyone with local knowledge to check street names etc?The twist at the end that seems to have a annoyed a lot of reviewers didn't really annoy me - it was a strangely quirky book throughout so I didn't think that made it any more quirky/strange really."}, {"userName": "Cindy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3532544-cindy", "userReview": "Looks like a good beginning to another series of detective mysteries headed by a female inspector. Easy to read and interesting tidbits about Sweden. It made me get to a map to see where these places were located.I found the conclusion most improbable and that somewhat diminished my rating of the book. Will try the next book to see how it goes.
