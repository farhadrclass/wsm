I didn't enjoy the read, but I didn't hate it either. I'm mostly neutral toward the story as a whole. Well, I'm mostly neutral toward a lot of things these days, and this book just happened to catch me at a bad time. (Going through another reading slump and haven't been able to find anything un-put-down-able.)If you like baking, sweets, baking sweets, Vancouver, and some romance and magic in your urban fantasy, then you might like this book. You might even think it's cute, and I suppose it is. It's a light fluffy dessert that, while not for my particular salty palate, can be enjoyable for people who like Sarah Addison Allen's books.Full review at https://covers2covers.wordpress.com/2..."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24425033-kim", "userReview": "Cute book. The surprise twist ends up being pretty darn obvious, and there is some trouble with pacing. Sometimes the story drags and other times too much seems to happen too quickly. I think it could have benefited from some stricter editing (every sentence in the prose that starts with, \"yes, I...\" should have been cut. They're annoying, unnecessary and happen way too often).The narrator, Jade, is a bit too little-miss-perfect for my tastes (gorgeous, gifted, is good at everything, has a line-out-the-door successful bakery at 23, and everyone loves her), but I did like she had obvious problems with her multiple, super hunky love interests being super stalky. Which, unfortunately, strays from the norm for the genre. And while, as a baker myself, I can appreciate the time, detail, and realism in describing the cupcakes, there were times it was a bit much.Still, the book is focused more on magic lore and action than the many hunks, which is also a refreshing change from this sort of female-geared urban fantasy book. And if it was pared down just a little bit more, I'd find Jade's voice much more entertaining. I always did love snarky main characters.Overall, it's a good beach read, but nothing overly special. Although I do have this to say: who has a problem with the smell of a bakery?

Maybe examine why I was so reluctant to read a book with such a cutesy cover. Well, it turns out this book is kind of offensively bad. It oscillates between \"inane facebook post\" and \"needlessly cryptic DeviantArt entry.\" Calling it a fluff romance would be generous--it's mostly a dizzy and not at all realized non-character of a protagonist complaining quite a bit in between eyeing every male in the book and describing her wardrobe. For chick lit, it's almost entirely devoid of chicks, and the ones that do exist seem to all be pitted against each other in the long run. Kind of offensive, weirdly. No thanks. I tried.

I am not sure if her writing has evolved, because the writing has always been good; I think it is more the right, dare I say it... recipe in this book. :-) The cast of characters, from Jade to the supporting cast of relatives and supernatural creatures, were all just right - a combination of mysterious, dangerous, interesting, and with unclear loyalties when it comes to Jade's welfare. The drama and action are both enough to keep you up past your bedtime, but not so unrelenting that you feel tempted to roll your eyes.There is one plot development that might be considered a twist, except it did not come as a surprise. Honestly I am not sure if it was really meant to - we as readers are the observers after all, not the characters who themselves might be struck with surprise at some turns of events. I don't personally think it is an author's duty to always make such reveals a surprise (unless they set out explicitly to do so) rather it is to make the watching of events unfolding ingeresting regadless of whether we saw anything coming. That definitely succeeds in this book - when I began reading the book's climax, despite having expected the development, I was actually so engrosseed I got some extra time on the treadmill without even noticing. :-P (Got to earn the calories for the cupcakes anyone reading this book will be craving...)Memorability Factor 9/10Follow this author: already do.

She thinks she's half-witch, half-human...when really she's not even half-human, she's half-something-else. What? I have no idea. She still doesn't know either, and the mystery of it is also delicious.I love that this included vampires and werewolves but that they weren't the focus of the story. As in, they weren't the protagonist. And they both seemed out to help her, not eat her. I get tired of the typical vampire story pretty fast but this wasn't like that. I loved the dialogue between the main character, Jade, and her sister. It was so typically like siblings that it always made me laugh.I loved that the obvious mentors, Mom and Grandma, weren't around to rescue Jade or make things easy on her. She's finding out who she is and WHAT she is, and in the meantime making the most awesome sounding cupcakes ever. I want to buy those cupcakes. *hint...the author has recipes for them on her website.

Yes, my name is Jade and I collect jadeite.\" Ugh. Stop.Also at one point she said her relief was \"palatable.\" Um... pretty sure the word you're looking for is PALPABLE.

The main character, Jade, owns a bakery in a Vancouver that is essentially a magical backwater. Not a lot of huge names in magic, but lots of dabblers. And as we pass through an interesting setting, this is where the cracks start to show. That is, we spend some time getting to know Jade, our main character. I'd say she's idealistic, but thinking and skimming back through the book, she's not. I'd say she's na\u00efve, but that's the same case. The most accurate phrases I can think of are mildly self-deluding and willfully ignorant. I have a soft-spot for protagonists that can grate or be otherwise unpleasant, but this was a bit too much to find palatable. At one point after realizing that this girl was painfully oblivious, I had to walk away from the book for a few minutes in frustration.  My other issue with Cupcakes is a strong tendency for telling instead of showing. Her feelings for a possible love interest seem to pop up out of nowhere. (One yoga class and a smoothie? Really? That's it? You could have loved him for creeping on you and buying you a smoothie that costs less than a tenner?) There's also an attempt to quietly drop a hint about stools in the earlier chapters that ends up coming across more like a stampede of elephants. The entire last chapter felt essentially like a rushed summary. I understand the idea of leaving a few unanswered storylines to keep us coming for the second book, but I felt that too much was left out to be even somewhat satisfying as its own book.  Despite these issues, I did make it through the book. The plot was clich\u00e9, true. However, for a read you can knock out in just a few hours, it was a fun kind of clich\u00e9. Sure, getting it from Jade's point of view occasionally drove me to teeth-grinding levels of irritation, but I was actually interested in the murders, and in the politics of the Dowser universe.  In the end, I'm giving Cupcakes two stars. Jade might have made my list of least favorite POV characters and things could have been less rushed and summarized. Still, the storyline was fun, and the brevity means you can knock this one out in an afternoon. It's not something I'll put on my recommendations list, and I seriously doubt I'll buy anymore of the Dowser series. Still, this book deserves a general 'meh' instead of a 'hissing while deleting it from my Kindle and trying to remove it from my library.'"}, {"userName": "Ana", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7608352-ana", "userReview": "I hate people who blatantly lie but, most of all, I hate people who know they're being lied to and do nothing to get to the truth.

She never questioned anything they ever said, no matter how ridiculous it sounded, and then she gets pissed when her sister and Kett threw that in her face. She also blatantly ignored her sister's evilness. Were you fooled? 'Cause I wasn't. Not from the first time she showed up. When Jade actually caught Rusty's magic in the zombie...I immediately thoughtSienna! How Jade managed to be hurt and shocked is beyond me. How the whole werewolf/vampire thing ended? No surprise there 'cause that's just how high-handed both her mom and gran are. Sure as hell won't stop trying to control her life now only 'cause she found their lies. Stupid girl.

Why are Jade\u2019s trinkets turning up at the scene of the crime?

We met quite a few different supernaturals in this story, and it wasn\u2019t easy to guess who the overall culprit was.I totally loved the cupcake part of the story though.

She is a dowser, she can sense and see others\u2019 magic and even track the magic. Also, she takes trinkets with residual magic and pieces them together into necklaces and artwork. She is happy with her uneventful life, until a vampire shows up on her doorstep! Soon, she is thrown in the magical world of shape shifters, vampires and magical beings. She didn\u2019t pay attention when her powerful Gran was teaching her about magic wielders. It seems that a dark magic wielder has been murdering shape shifters in the area. The Alpha of the Pack and an ancient vampire are asking, no demanding that Jade help them solve the murders. After all, her scent and trinkets are on the victims! Jade doesn\u2019t even understand her own powers and discovers that Gran and her mom have been telling her half-truths her whole life.  This is a wonderful story of a heroine discovering her true powers, her hidden heritage and above all, it\u2019s just a humorous adventure! Jade and her new \u201cfriends\u201d track down the dark magic murderer and while I pieced together the identity of the person, the apprehension was totally unexpected! There are only close encounters of the romantic kind, but this is only Book One in a series that promises to be spellbinding. No pun intended! There is just one suggestion for potential readers!

With that being said, it's currently free on Kindle, and if you are looking for a light read, it's not the worst thing ever.As noted in the title, this book made me crave cupcakes like crazy. Jade is the owner of a cupcake bakery in Vancouver. She is known as a dowser, an individual who attracts magic and magical creatures; she's also half-witch. In addition to baking, Jade makes trinkets - something like found-art/jewelry - and hangs them all over the bakery, wears them, gives them as presents, etc. Right in the beginning, she sees a vampire standing outside the bakery watching her. Later, he accosts her in a nightclub bathroom, and then follows her when she walks home. This sounds a lot worse than it really is, as this vampire isn't all that bad.Eventually, werewolves also start showing up. Murders have been occurring, and Jade's trinkets are being found on the bodies. The mystery so ensues!Jade's character isn't well though out. She flip-flops between cool businesswoman and airhead. I just wanted the author to pick one, rather than trying to have this character be all these different sorts of characters.The ending and twist is rather telegraphed and not so surprising. The magical people besides Jade don't get too much of a role in the book. Jade is constantly talking to herself, and often will detract from the scene. The one big mystery about Jade's parentage is not solved by the end of the book, in typical fashion of series. And there is barely any romance at all.There is one scene where Jade goes to Whole Foods for a juice with a werewolf after a yoga class. I just had to laugh at that! So it's that kind of book. It's not a serious urban fantasy.

I found the book impossible to put down. Something about the interactions of the characters really hooked me. If you like contemporary-era paranormal mysteries, you may love this, especially if you like your books on the lighter side. I got this e-book for free from Bookrooster.com with the promise to review it. Usually, I'm skeptical about free e-books. Often, they lack the much needed assistance of a good editor. This one surprised me, though. The writing was good and the story drew me in. Now I'm REALLY looking forward to the next in the series. The premise is that a low-level half-witch in Vancouver runs a bakery. Her adopted sister and grandmother are big in her life, and her mom is a free spirit. One day with her grandmother is out of town, a vampire shows up at her door, scaring her. Then she meets a bunch of weres at a dance club. All of them are in town investigating a murder, and some signs point in her direction. One of the weres wants to date her, but that doesn't go so well. Eventually, she is drawn into the murder investigation and discovers some surprising things about her heritage.There were a couple things that bugged me about his book that kept if from a true 5-star. 1) When someone died, there was little to no emotional fallout. That's what I mean by \"lighter\". It's almost a \"cozy\" - a mystery where sex and violence are downplayed - but not exactly. I think this might be a case of a newby writer more than intent, so this could change as the series progresses. 2) The cupcake bakery gimmick dates this book. I'm really tired of cupcake bakeries in pop fiction. Two Broke Girls and the Diesel series by Janet Evanovich are enough for me, thank you. It's the go-to girl job this decade, like opening a coffee shop was in the 00's. 3) I figured out who did it fairly early. The clues were a bit too obvious to me. 4) The title is misleading.

She can taste the different kinds of magic as if they were cupcakes, and crafts together magical objects she finds, making trinkets to decorate her house, bakery, and herself.

It was really good and funny too. Jade is a witch, but not a particularly strong one and she doesn't really like using magic much either. She makes cute little trinkets out of pieces of old jewellery and other odds and ends with their residual magic and that's about it. She runs a cupcake store (I SO want to live near this store as it sounds heavenly!) and leads a fairly mundane life, but that's all about to change! One day an odd character appears at her store - a vampire in the daytime! No one else can see him, but her wards prevent him from entering. Jade believes she is safe for now until he appears at her window that night making accusations against her. Jade really has no idea what is talking about, but at another chance (or was it?) meeting he accuses Jade of murdering someone with her magic. Jade soon becomes involved against her wishes and own common sense in the hunt for the murderer once it becomes clear she was not directly involved, but unfortunately whoever it is has been using her trinkets to channel their magic. She feels indirectly responsible and as scared and ignorant of the supernatural world as she is, she knows she must help if she can. What she does discover is the last thing she ever wanted to find, but at least she finds some answers to the problem and some answers to who she really is and who her family are as well. She has been kept in the dark for too long and now it's time to tell Jade what she wants and needs to know. I liked Jade. She has been so sheltered for her whole life that she is really clueless about other supernatural creatures and the world they all inhabit. She has to learn quick on her feet and her snarky attitude in times of fear or stress is hilarious. I did guess the murderer quite early on, but was surprised in the turn around of the events and was surprised that Jade hadn't figured it out either. I am going to grab the rest of this series now and look forward to reading more about Jade and her involvement in this new world."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9481759-laura", "userReview": "3.5 starsOverall I found this to be a quick and enjoyable read. Of course it helped that I was in the mood for this type of urban fantasy. I don't think the cover really does the story justice in that the cupcake caused me to anticipate something fluffy and silly and it wasn't really like that. The story itself was fairly typical of urban fantasy. There's a half witch with questionable parentage who has been led to believe that the father she's never met was an average human man and that her magic level is minimum despite EVERYONE else knowing or suspecting that this is not the case. There was a lot of neck sniffing and \"What are you's\" floating around in this story. That was probably the most significant annoyance I had.The rest of the plot centered around the deaths of several werewolves and certain evidence left at the scene pointed to the heroine as a suspect and after its determined that she isn't the culprit, she's tasked with helping to figure out who the guilty party actually is. This leads to a working relationship with the pack and their crabby muscle-bound leader, who I thought was also somewhat typical but certainly not the worst I've read. On the positive side it tosses a few really likable characters into the mix.In conclusion, I will probably continue the series. I'd like to know more about the mysterious unknown father and I'm curious to see how the relationships progress. Hopefully there will be enough character development to keep me satisfied."}, {"userName": "(Tori-Smexybooks) smexys_sidekick", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3094317-tori-smexybooks-smexys-sidekick", "userReview": "An entertainingly start to an urban fantasy/paranormal mystery series that has a lot of potential once the author settles the storyline, smoothes out the dialogue, and gets a handle on her tendency to repeat herself."}, {"userName": "Abbie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10194401-abbie", "userReview": "Actual rating - 3.5I liked the main character in this, but I think I'd like her cakes more! This was a pretty good read, which managed to keep my interest. The first few pages made it very difficult to resist baking/eating cupcakes though, so beware of this book if you're on a diet!Overall, A decent read."}], "description": "If you\u2019d asked me a week ago, I would have told you that the best cupcakes were dark chocolate with chocolate cream cheese icing, that dancing in a crowd of magic wielders \u2014 the Adept \u2014 was better than sex, and that my life was peaceful and uneventful.
