You won't see it coming!Also, beside the strong mystery angle on the storyline, Emma Healey, the author, was able to construct a wonderful portrait of the time when people reach old age, they have memory troubles, and after a whole life of being independent, they need to rely on the help of others, younger than them and even their offspring are giving them orders and telling them what they can do and where they can go.If younger people tend to critize and not being patient to their elders, just try to be in their places and maybe you will understand better how they may be feeling about the whole situation of getting older.Elizabeth is Missing! Isn't she? Mmh... who are you?! Why are you reading my review?! Why am I writing a review?! Let me check my pockets, it seems that I have some notes... give me a moment.A kinda downside point is that while is a quite short novel with like less than 250 pages, even so, I think that this story could work even better in a short story setting. It's not like that each episode is boring or anything, quite the contrary, and even some side-plots proved to be totally essential to the main storyline. However, even with the possitive impact left at the end of the reading, I do believe that in a short story development this could be a real masterpiece worthy of 5-stars rating. So, I think that taking out a star from the rating is enough to show my \"feeling\" that this could be better as a short story regardless that it's still a narrow novel.If you decide to read it, you won't regret it... or forget it! ;)Elizabeth? Which Elizabeth are you talking about?! I was here for a reason, right? Was I writing something? Was it something about a book? Did I read a book? Really? I don't think so! You must be confused! If I'd read that novel \"Elizabeth is Missing\" that you are talking about, I would remember it, right?"}, {"userName": "Kelly (and the Book Boar)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11183856-kelly-and-the-book-boar", "userReview": "[MAUDE!

Her memories of the past and the disappearance of her sister Sukey have become confused with the disappearance of her friend in the present day, Elizabeth. Suffering from dementia, her days have become a jumble of things, images and thoughts that don't seem to fit. I would imagine how challenging writing a book from the perspective of a woman suffering from this malady , but the author has done a wonderful job. At times humorous, at times poignant, one cannot help feeling so very sorry for Maude, as a character she is very likable. Her present is not all there and even her past becomes hard to hold on to, so she relies more and more on her pocket full of sticky notes.

I feel lost, much like Maud did in this book.There's two stories going on here... Maud an 82 year old woman who has dementia and then young Maud, who is desperately searching for her sister who has just vanished. I will say the author was spot on with dementia. I worked with my grandmother for a full year before she passed this January and she acted a lot like Maud. That's all I can say because it is still a touchy subject for me and the wound from grandma passing is still fresh. The young Maud is close to her sister and then one day Sukey or Susan vanishes. Her husband also goes awol but then reappears later in the story to ask where his wife was and Maud continues to look for her, therefore overlapping into the older Maud who is searching for Elizabeth her friend.The two stories do intersect but I felt so confused at the end. I guess I was expecting more of a crazy ending than there was.Not the best book and I wish I would have quit but I wanted to find out what happened... I wouldn't recommend... Sorry!

It's not your conventional crime novel, but it certainly is compelling. The main protagonist is an 82 year old lady suffering from dementia. The way the author has dealt with the subject of dementia is quite remarkable. She's captured brilliantly the anxiety, the confusion, and the fear associated with it, so much so, that it's hard to believe she's not yet thirty herself! It's beautifully written, hilarious at times, heartbreakingly sad at others, and it maintains its suspense right the way through. Emma Healey is a wise, intelligent and perceptive writer, and this is a really good debut novel. Can't wait to see what she has to offer in the future."}, {"userName": "Ivonne Rovira", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3803671-ivonne-rovira", "userReview": "My Cuban mother \u2014 God bless her soul \u2014 used to lament, \u201cIvonne, \u00a1llegar a viejo es lo \u00faltimo!\u201d (Ivonne, getting old is the absolute worst!) Still in my 30s, I nodded sympathetically, but I really had no idea at all. Emma Healey\u2019s Elizabeth Is Missing brought those memories back for me \u2014 rather ironic for a novel about the gradual fading of memory. Elizabeth Is Missing ostensibly recounts how Maud Horsham, a tenacious 80-plus-year-old Englishwoman battling dementia, tries to investigate the abrupt disappearance of her longtime best friend, Elizabeth Markham. But it was a very, very different novel to what I imagined. (To say any more would be to spoil it.) However, I can say that this bittersweet novel, in addition to examine Maud\u2019s obsession to the very end with finding Elizabeth, unblinkingly examines the indignities, small frights, embarrassments, patronizing remarks and attitudes, and limitations that come with aging. Whether humorous, cringe-worthy, or poignant, these episodes ring so true to life. This exploration of the fragility of memory and identity, coupled with two fabulous mysteries, will keep you glued to Healey\u2019s amazing debut novel. Maud calls Elizabeth repeatedly, then repeatedly visits Elizabeth\u2019s home, then visits her church, and Maud keeps on relentlessly investigating. Recognizing her slipping mind, Maud scrupulously jots down her every discovery and clue on slips of paper she squirrels away in her purse.Although her daughter Helen, granddaughter Katie, caregiver Carla, and just about everyone else presumes that Maud is merely indulging a senile obsession, Maud knows that something has gone terribly wrong \u2014 no matter what Peter, Elizabeth\u2019s tightfisted, unpleasant, foul-mouthed son, tells the world. As Maud investigates Elizabeth\u2019s disappearance, she finds herself increasingly thinking about another disappearance nearly 70 years ago, when her beloved older sister, Susan \u201cSukey\u201d Gerard, vanished in the autumn of 1946. Both cases contain remarkable parallels. Investigating one disappearance reopens that earlier case in Elizabeth\u2019s mind, which she re-examines in a fresh light. As the novel progresses, Maud remembers less and less about the now and more and more about then.Readers will find themselves embracing proud, vulnerable Maud, who writes herself notes on the case for when her memory fails. They\u2019ll also find themselves sympathizing with Maud\u2019s beleaguered daughter Helen and enjoying Maud\u2019s cheerful bohemian teenage granddaughter Katie. A loyal friend to the end, Maud doesn\u2019t want to let go until she gets to the truth \u2014 and you\u2019ll find you can\u2019t let go of Maud Horsham long after you\u2019ve devoured the last page and unraveled both mysteries, the new and the old."}, {"userName": "Dem", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2752994-dem", "userReview": "Elizabeth is missing was an emotional story about an elderly lady who is living with dementia.I liked the story as I found it extremely effective at highlighting how difficult the illness is on family members; I found the character of Helen so real in this story and I am sure there are daughters and sisters and family out there reading this book and can identity with the character of Helen as she tries to look after and understand the world in which her mother finds herself struck in. \nInterestingly... we don't get the story from Helen's prospective and yet I sympathised so much with her character and I think the reason for this was that I became Helen and Maud became my mother while reading the novel\nI found the author's use of language very effective throughout the book and her descriptions of situations very real. Maud is such a convincing character in this novel and I could have rated it 5 stars alone for how well Maud's voice stands out in this story. I did however find many holes in the plot and the book became rather repetitive half ways through.

Elizabeth is Missing written by Emma Healey is a thoroughly intriguing and a highly compelling novel.Thank you Penguin for providing me with an ARC.Maud is a 82years old woman, suffering from dementia. She is getting forgetful hence she writes notes to remind herself of petty things and to keep up with her own life. She couldn't reach her best friend Elizabeth, so she assumes something terrible has happened to her and keeps repeating that Elizabeth is missing. She chants those words to everybody around her, to her daughter, Elizabeth's sons, police-men, but nobody pays heed to her. She tangles the present situation of Elizabeth with her own sister, Sukey, who disappeared after the end of the war in London. The author has woven the story in a very beautiful way by giving two angles to the plot, one is the mystery with the right elements of twists and turns and the other is the old age, memory-loss. Her story-telling is wonderful; it's more like she manages to bring this drama into our rooms, as if every detail is unfolding right in front of her eyes. The story is so gripping that it'll completely hook you from its very first pages. Maud's character totally justifies and fits perfectly with the plot, a woman whom no one pays attention to, as it\u2019s getting harder for her to remember things. We can feel her frustration and pain and the author gives us a thorough insight into the life of an old woman suffering from dementia and how she manages to unravel a mystery surrounding her best friend and her sister.It\u2019s one of the most anticipated novels of this year, undoubtedly the best and the most intense one."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41464918-linda", "userReview": "Emma Healey did an extraordinary job of putting me into the mind of 82-year old Maud who was suffering from Alzheimer's disease. From paragraph to paragraph, you never knew if you would be in Maud's past where her older sister, Sukey, disappeared or in her present trying to find her close friend, Elizabeth, who she believes to be missing. Yes, I wanted to know what happened to Elizabeth and Sukey, but I got so involved in Maud's thinking process that I felt like I was reading three novels at once.\"Elizabeth is Missing\" had a very interesting storyline which kept me engaged throughout, but I couldn't help wish I had read this book before I watched this disease take a close friend and my beloved aunt away from me.

I must say, my expectations were high given its early hype. Originally titled Strange Companions, it was much remarked upon for drawing global interest and sparking a bidding war between nine publishers at the London Book Fair; a year before it was due to come out in the UK, translation rights had already been sold in five countries. Bearing that in mind, I was expecting something really remarkable. It's not remarkable. It's just quite good.Narrator Maud is in her eighties and suffering from Alzheimer's. Her narrative is coherent, but presented as a continuous inner monologue, so on one page she may remember who someone is, or what she's supposed to be doing in that moment, but the next she has forgotten; an effective way to create a voice for someone with severe short-term memory problems while avoiding too much repetition or disorder. The main plot hinges on Maud's conviction that her closest friend, Elizabeth, has disappeared, a belief that nobody else will listen to or take seriously, particularly as Maud can't remember when she last saw Elizabeth or how long she has been 'missing'. Interwoven with this is the story of Maud's older sister Sukey, who really did disappear, in the aftermath of the Second World War. Maud frequently goes back to memories of Sukey and her own youthful efforts to find out what happened to her sister, in passages that often merge with Maud's pursuit of the truth about Elizabeth. Both threads slowly build to connected revelations. Much has been made of how brilliant an idea it is to have Maud as the main character but, in my opinion, it's a bit of a trick, a clever device that easily covers up other flaws. It's impossible to say you dislike or don't sympathise with an elderly woman suffering from dementia without sounding like a terrible person. (Incidentally, I didn't dislike her or fail to sympathise with her, but I didn't feel like I cared about her anywhere near as much as I should have done, either. The character is supposed to be unforgettable but I'm pretty sure I will have forgotten all about this book very soon.) Equally, the fact that Maud is suffering from memory loss and mental confusion can be used to explain away a plethora of issues with the story, from muddled parts of the narrative and endlessly repeated phrases ('I can't think'), to the unbelievable neatness of the ending. Earlier this year I read The Night Guest by Fiona McFarlane, another debut novel with an ageing, mentally addled protagonist in which memories may or may not be reliable; the past bleeds into the present; there is a mystery which might only exist in the character's head, etc. I found The Night Guest to be a much more complex, nuanced and effective exploration of these issues than Elizabeth is Missing. Despite the hype and fuss about the central conceit, the thing that really stood out to me was the authenticity and compelling nature of the post-war scenes. Given the fact that Healey is a young debut author who hadn't been published at all prior to this book, it's amazing how effortless these parts of the narrative feel, and I found the Sukey plotline much more gripping than the Elizabeth one. While I enjoyed this novel, I was left slightly disappointed that it didn't live up to its status as one of the most anticipated debuts of 2014. I don't know how to recommend it, really - I can't imagine this being the type of book that anyone would absolutely love rather than just like, yet I've already seen numerous glowing reviews, and it seems that I'm in the minority by not adoring it. I think my problem with it was that I enjoyed the story more than the characterisation, but the book is really all about characterisation, which means the conclusions of the two plotlines turn out to be somewhat pedestrian. While a good, solid debut, Elizabeth is Missing failed to ignite any particular spark in me."}, {"userName": "Frona", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58118625-frona", "userReview": "As in The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time, the story is told through the lenses of a certain mental condition that only few have access to. In this case, it is Alzheimer\u2019s that disables the protagonist from reaching what her mind has set before her: solving a disappearance of a beloved one. But whilst providing an old lady with countless obstacles, the disease does more; through forceful emergence of what was trying to be forgotten, it opens the sheer possibility of the task. The past takes lead and shapes present, or what it needs from it, in tailored patterns. The book shows credibly how losing a hold over continuity of the present necessarily leads to strengthening of an inner world and enforcing its persistence to act out regardless of everyday barriers that slow down a healthy person: fears, others, physical obstacles. The gap between inner and outer, past and present, is sometimes lost in the narrative, but the author reinstates them with the help of a mystery, which gives the protagonist some focus and unity. What would otherwise remain dispersed and hidden from the outer world, is in this way made sensible and given a logic of its own.As in The Curious Incident as well, it seems that only a peculiar state of mind is not itself enough to make the story interesting. The mysterious hook is needed to lighten up the matter and show the disease in broad spectrum. The tool with which both stories are told is similar to the psychological test where you need to make a castle out of a sheet of paper \u2013 what is assessed isn't the final result itself as much as all the characteristics that one reveals unconsciously by focusing on the result: interactions with others, forethought or rashness, working under time limit etc. So, if all you care about mysteries is who's done it, you'll probably be disappointed by the book's predictability, but that was never really the point."}, {"userName": "Malia", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5953660-malia", "userReview": "So, I've finally read it, and can confirm, it is worth all the fuss. I can hardly believe this is a debut! It is written with such confidence and eloquence, but then Healey did study creative writing.The story centers around Maud, an 81 year-old woman descending ever deeper into dementia. The book is told both from Maud's present and her past, and as the story moves along, the line between these times becomes ever more blurry, disintegrating slowly as Maud grows more confused. While Maud is the kind of character you want to hug and make a nice cup of tea, she isn't portrayed as this vision of perfection. From the flashbacks into her past, we see a willful young woman who isn't always the easiest to sympathize with. But taking that into consideration, Healey manages to create very real character for us. A person with flaws, but a good, kind heart and you cannot help but be drawn into her world, as much as you might actually want to escape it.I was truly impressed with the thoughtfulness and level of dignity in this book, and the handling of a subject that is often dismissed or misunderstood. Growing old is, in today's society especially, treated as an illness in itself, but the alternative is nothingness. Maud's story emphasized the fact that old age is deeply deserving of respect. What happened to her to get through her 81 years was no walk in the park, and what she, and surely other sufferers of dementia, are faced with is terrifying, for them and also for the families having to watch their loved ones get lost and being unable to do much to prevent it. Maud had a kind daughter and granddaughter, who were overwhelmed, but helpful, and seemed quite realistic. This is certainly well worth reading. But read it when the sun is shining, before winter swoops in and everything is gray and too bleak to read such a sad story.Find more reviews and bookish fun at http://www.princessandpen.com"}, {"userName": "Evelina | AvalinahsBooks", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13716524-evelina-avalinahsbooks", "userReview": "When I got this book from NetGalley back in 2014, I put it away for a long time because I didn't even know what NetGalley was all about back then. But now I know I should have read it much sooner. It is a great book. It has really been an emotional experience to read it.The book tells a story of an old woman, slowly sinking into senility (perhaps Alzheimer's? It's never pointed out). She seems to be stuck on the fact of her friend Elizabeth being missing, and although she's heard the answer before, she can never seem to remember it, nor can she let it go. Perhaps it's because something similar has happened to her 70 years ago, when her older sister disappeared. So we watch the old lady's efforts to bring back her friend, whilst seeing how she gradually loses her memory, all of her current life, making her past more real than the present. The story of her sister's disappearance is gradually uncovered as she looks for her missing friend, and the ending is satisfying and meaningful. In a way, it's a psychological story which makes you relate to the old and suffering, as well as a passive sort of suspense story where you have to keep guessing at what happened to her sister 70 years ago. This book is really touching in many ways, as you start relating to the problems of old age and memory loss, and you it helps you understand what you could have never pondered, especially if you're young. The author really did well trying to put you in the position of someone who is slowly losing their world, and it's really easy to sympathise with the main character and understand her position, same as everyone else in the story. This book will teach you compassion for the old, the weak, it will also make you understand the fragility of time and your own life.

That in itself is terrifying, (as I look at all the reminders to myself tacked to the desk on a sticky note!)

Why doesn't anyone understand you? That said, I felt that this story just went on, and on, and on. Which is what Maude must have felt. I was anxious to get to a resolution.....about Elizabeth as well as the disappearance of Maude's sister so many years ago.

It is also one of the most unique ones. The story of this novel is quite simple: we follow our main character Maud, who is an older woman suffering from dementia, so to say that she is forgetful would be quite an understatement. Maud is convinced that her best friend Elizabeth is missing, and that is where the story starts. I wouldn't want to spoil anything more because I went into this novel knowing just this, and I feel like I enjoyed it more because of that. Even though I did enjoy the plot of this novel, and how past and present blended together, my favorite thing about it would be the writing style. Since I've read a few of negative reviews for this book, I can see how the writing style can annoy a person, but to me, it made the book even more unique and better. The Author, Emma Healey, in a perfect way presented Maud's disease: through her way of thinking, and how she constantly repeated the same things. That really set this book apart from other mystery novels. To conclude, Elizabeth Is Missing definitely is not a novel for everybody. It's quite strange and the writing style can be annoying at times. However, I completely enjoyed the novel, and after a few days of thinking about it I decided to change my rating from 4 to 5 stars. The book stayed with me, and I couldn't keep my mind of it, so it definitely did deserve 5 stars from me."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5210022-julie", "userReview": "Elizabeth is Missing by Emma Healy is a 2014 Harper Publication. I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review. For me this was a stunning novel, not only as a mystery but one that gives an unique insight into the mind of someone dealing with dementia and the effects it has on them and their family.  When Maud who is 82 years old, realizes her friend Elizabeth is gone, she desperately tries to convey this to her daughter, Helen, who is her sole care taker. No one takes her seriously, which frustrates and agitates Maud even more. But, this turn of events has jarred loose a torrent of memories regarding the disappearance of Maud's sister \u201cSukey\u201d when she was much younger. She tends to confuse the two events in her mind and of course is fighting so hard to keep things straight and communicate to those around her who are totally clueless about what is really going on in Maud's head When her sister disappeared, Maud was driven nearly mad by it . Slowly, Maud's mind sketches together the events of the past with the present day vanishing of her friend Elizabeth. It's a slow moving realization and the saddest thing of all is Maud's inability to hold on to her train of thought long enough to enjoy some kind of peace of mind or obtain closure in any way for herself. I found myself feeling intensely angry with Helen and the police and Elizabeth's son, Peter. While I know it is so difficult to deal with a parent suffering from dementia, and I am certainly not making light of that burden, I couldn't help but feel irritation at Helen's making faces at Maud behind her back or dismissing her symptoms with the doctor or a thousand other ways she was rather unkind to her mother. I mean, this was her mother!! She resented every single thing she had to do for her and blamed her brother for not helping out more, which of course I would have to agree with that, and realistically this happens more often than people realize among siblings. Helen performs her duties admirably, but it's seldom she shows any real empathy or tenderness for her mother. The two mysteries, the cold case, if you will, and the current mystery of Elizabeth's disappearance is compelling mostly because we know that there is something twisted up in Maud's mind and our frustration is as deep as hers. We know on one level that Elizabeth's disappearance is more of a catalyst for the deeply buried trauma of Maud's memories regarding her sister, but there is also a feeling of foreboding in regards to Elizabeth, mainly because Maude simply can not turn the idea loose. She is like a dog with a bone when it comes to her great concern over her friend's absence. I think at times there are books placed in a rather generic genre classification, like mystery, suspense or psychological thriller, and that fits in this case, no doubt, BUT, it also leads people to draw a certain expectation of what to expect, and then perhaps, as could be the case with this book, the reader isn't quite sure what to think. The mystery is certainly understated, but I'm afraid many missed the poignancy of the story and the truly remarkable thing the mind really is. While, Maud was mostly unaware of what she has ultimately revealed by insisting Elizabeth was missing, it is astounding what she has managed to accomplish here. No, this is not exactly a whodunit in the traditional sense. Yes, it is difficult to read, and is very emotional and yes, it is slow moving without many of the elements most mysteries employ. So, I suppose it might have been best to have added this one to the literary fiction or contemporary fiction category along with mystery/ suspense to give the potential buyer an idea of what lay ahead. I thought this was a well thought out novel that maybe went over the heads of some who perhaps are not in any way familiar with dementia other than what they see on television. If you know someone with this disease, I can think you would look at this book with a different perspective. If you are interested in reading the typical mystery novel, police procedural, detective, forensic, sort of thing, then keep going. But, if you are looking for something that digs a little deeper into the human psyche and examines the long term emotional effects of loss, crime, guilt and in some ways even redemption, give this one a look. 4.5 stars rounded to 5"}, {"userName": "Stacey (prettybooks)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3533262-stacey-prettybooks", "userReview": "Maud has one of the most poignant, memorable and distinctive voices I've ever read. She's eighty-two years old and suffers from Alzheimer's disease, meaning that everyday life is struggle for her, although she doesn't always realise it herself. Maud buys tins of peaches even though she has a cupboard full of them. She makes cups of tea and leaves them to go cold. She has to be told don't leave the house, don't cook, don't keep calling the neighbours.One day, Maud finds a piece of paper in her pocket that says \"Elizabeth is missing\". Elizabeth is one of Maud's closest and dearest friends, so she embarks on a confusing and disorienting journey to find out the truth. She needs to find ways to ensure she doesn't forget her mission, so she makes little notes of her discoveries. Maud's present experiences are twisted with memories of her sister Sukey's disappearance decades before, and she often cannot tell whether she's living twelve-year-old Maud's story or her future.If you've ever struggled to comprehend what having dementia must be like, surely Elizabeth is Missing is one of the most vivid ways of experiencing it for yourself. As the reader, we're in the mind of Maud. It'll leave you frustrated on behalf of Maud and a little angry at the way people with dementia are treated, yet you'll find yourself understanding it at the same time. It's a lose-lose battle for everyone. Maud frustrates her daughter, annoys the doctor and amuses the police, and not one of them is able to help her find Elizabeth. Because dementia is one of those things that both fascinates and terrifies me, I adored the present story (\"Elizabeth is missing\") but occasionally wanted to push past her sister Sukey's. As the story went on, I couldn't wait to see how both stories were connected.Elizabeth is Missing is brilliant not because of the mystery aspect of the story, although it kept me on edge, but because of its unforgettable perspective. It'll leave you questioning your own memories and ability to hold onto them. Elizabeth is Missing has done a fabulous job in showing the world just how serious dementia is \u2013 it doesn't receive as much attention as illnesses affecting younger people, but Maud \u2013 as a much older protagonist \u2013 shows us that she is most certainly still here.I also reviewed this book over on Pretty Books."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1179650-cheryl", "userReview": "This is one book I was really looking forward to reading. So when it arrived I picked it up right away to start reading. I actually thought this book would be more psychological thriller. It kind of did mess with my mind but the problem was that I found most of the characters lacking personalities. Also the story seemed to drag on and move at an incredibly slow pace with little action. Another thing that I did find distracting was the many different characters introduced though out the story with hardly any background as to what part they played in the whole story. The last third of the book is where the whole story comes together and the mystery surrounding what happened is revealed."}, {"userName": "Annet", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1166369-annet", "userReview": "Lovely book!

"Talk about an unreliable narrator...When we first meet Maud- the older woman seems kind and a little scattered. She flashes back between the past- when her sister, Sukey went missing and present day. Her friend Elizabeth is missing and she can't quite figure out what to do. Everyone she tells struggles to believe her and usually by the time she gets someplace, she quickly forgets why she is there. Maud struggles with the onset of dementia. Watching her spiral into her own head was heartwrenching. I felt so strongly for Maud's family and how frustrated she was to accomplish anything and constantly forgetting.The writing was good for a debut novel, but not great. It was a quick book with a somewhat satisfying ending- even though you know there will never be a happy ending for Maud herself as she battles this disease. The author's note at the end of the audio version mentions that she based the idea for this book on her own grandmother, which I found endearing.

When the past and the present seemingly come together until her identity slowly dissolves?Set in England, \"Elizabeth Is Missing\" is that story, and as it unfolds in the first person narrative of Maud, the aging mother and grandmother, we are soon catapulted into her interior world, almost as if the losses are ours.Most poignant of all is the terror and fear that Maud feels when she begins obsessively searching for her friend Elizabeth whom she is certain has been taken or spirited away. Perhaps by her son. The feelings are enhanced by intermittent memories of a time in her younger years when her sister Sukey went missing. That mystery haunts her, and as she reminisces, it is almost as if that loss is entangled with the present losses: of her best friend Elizabeth; her own independence; the memories that elude her; and the feelings of invisibility.Why does Maud feel compelled to dig in the garden? Why does she gather odds and ends into secret containers? Is there a very real connection between the past and the present that could explain these mysterious events?I totally empathized with Maud, especially since everyone in her life seemed to ignore her feelings and treat her like someone who no longer mattered. I felt her frustration, and even anger at her dismissive daughter Helen. Yes, I am sure Helen's feelings and impatient behavior were mitigated by the burden of being a caretaker, and that they might also be based on her worries and fears for her mother's safety.So imagine our surprise to find out that some of Maud's behavior might have a strong basis in fact, and are not just the ranting of a paranoid and obsessive old woman.Every page I turned brought to light new pieces of the tragic events in Maud's past and present life and her losses, and I could not wait to find out more. An unforgettable voyage that reminds us of the importance of empathy and understanding. Five stars."}, {"userName": "Ellinor", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8307014-ellinor", "userReview": "Elizabeth is Missing is told from the perspective of Maud, an 82-year-old woman who suffers from Alzheimer. Maud is trying to lead her life as well as possible. With all her struggles there is one thing that bothers her in particular: her friend Elizabeth is missing. While trying to find her, Maud remembers another unsolved mystery from her youth: shortly after the end of WWII her sister Sukey disappeared never to be seen again. As the story evolves, Maud\u2019s condition slowly but steadily deteriorates. In the beginning she still is able to lead a halfway decent life and always recognizes her daughter and granddaughter. After she is made to move in with her daughter she can\u2019t adjust to the new place and believes her daughter and granddaughter to be strangers most of the time.The reader slowly finds out more about what happened to Elizabeth and Sukey. What makes this book so extraordinary is that as Maud tells her story and a picture is slowly evolving for the reader, Maud is forgetting what happened. The only thing she always remembers is that Elizabeth is missing. This thought occupies her mind until the very end when all mysteries have been solved \u2013 something Maud doesn\u2019t remember anymore.The book is written is a very light way that often makes you want to laugh but also plucks your heartstrings. What is going on in an Alzheimer patient\u2019s mind probably couldn\u2019t have been described any better than Emma Healey does here. I highly recommend this book to anyone who would like to read a book from a new and different perspective. There have been comparisons to The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime and I can only agree with those. Both books involve a mystery solved be a person who doesn\u2019t fit into your usual detective models and who also isn\u2019t the type you normally deal with.(I received a free digital copy via Penguin/NetGalley)"}, {"userName": "Carolyn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19559507-carolyn", "userReview": "Eighty two year old Maud is slowly slipping into dementia. Her memory is failing and she can't always find the words she needs to tell people her inner thoughts and feelings. She is very concerned that her friend Elizabeth is missing. She's been to her house (several times) and she's not there, she told her daughter Helen (many times), she's phoned Elizabeth's son Peter (several times) and even been to the police (several times) but no one will listen. In her confusion her mind keeps harking back to another disappearance, that of her married sister Sukey just after the war. Despite the police investigating she never did find out whether Sukey ran away from her husband, cutting all ties with her family or was murdered. As she tries to recall what happened and what she has learnt since the pieces of the puzzle start to fit into place but no one is listening to her ramblings about the past. Will Maud find Elizabeth and will she ever find out what happened to Sukey?This is a very good debut novel. The writing is assured and confident. Maud as the main character feels like a realistic picture of an elderly woman struggling with her foggy memory. She is clearly loved by Helen, her busy daughter who loves her Mum but struggles to cope with her wanderings and forgetfulness. Inside Maud's confused brain is not a pretty place to be and we can feel her frustration as she searches for language and memories of what has happened to her friend and her sister. The tension slowly builds as we urge Maud to hold on to those thoughts and piece the puzzle together."}, {"userName": "Emma Sea", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5558652-emma-sea", "userReview": "My grandmother moved in with me in 2000 and I cared for her while she developed vascular dementia, until in 2013 I had to find her a residential care facility that specialized in dementia patients. Because of this I found the book very emotionally challenging to read. It brought back all the guilt and self-doubt I have about not caring for my grandmother at home any more.The book is gorgeously written, and brilliantly structured, but I found it just so heartbreaking and upsetting. I'm not sure I would recommend it to anyone caring for a family member with dementia, because the depiction of the disease is perfect and raw."}, {"userName": "Dale Harcombe", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4800708-dale-harcombe", "userReview": "Three and a half starsEighty two year old Maud is having problems with her memory. She may not remember what she did earlier in the day or even five minutes earlier, but there is one thing that keeps coming back to her repeatedly. Elizabeth is missing. At times Maud does not even remember her daughter Helen or her granddaughter Katy, but she remembers her sister Sukey who went missing years earlier and was never found. These memories surface and intertwine with her present and the idea that Elizabeth is missing. The other recurring point that keeps emerging is about planting and growing marrows. This is an interesting book and a clear picture of someone suffering from dementia and the difficulties of dealing with them. I found it easy to sympathise with Maud in her confusion of events but also with Helen, as she seeks to try and care for her mother without resorting to putting her into a nursing home. However Maud\u2019s muddle of dementia also makes the book harder to read. At times I considered putting it aside, but somehow I couldn\u2019t bring myself to do that. I wanted to know what happened, even though I had a suspicion of where the story might be heading. So, while this is not the easiest book to read it is worthwhile persisting."}], "description": "In this darkly riveting debut novel\u2014a sophisticated psychological mystery that is also a heartbreakingly honest meditation on memory, identity, and aging\u2014an elderly woman descending into dementia embarks on a desperate quest to find the best friend she believes has disappeared, and her search for the truth will go back decades and have shattering consequences.Maud, an aging grandmother, is slowly losing her memory\u2014and her grip on everyday life.
