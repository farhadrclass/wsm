An exploration, which is not merely to find a place, a balance with the world but rather to understand why is it that nothing makes sense or rather why \u201cnothing\u201d makes \u201cperfect sense\u201d. Can one live with this perception of nothingness and senselessness while still carrying a rational mind or is one in the danger of drifting away, as they say, with the flow of unrestrained thoughts? Surely, Beckett doesn\u2019t answer that. Suffering from an acute depression almost throughout his adult life, Sam\u2019s writing is an expression of his deep state of melancholy. As a reader, you are a witness to his feelings of extreme despair. If you don\u2019t keep a check and if you have, at any point in life, been plagued by hopelessness, you may find yourself moving towards a state where nothingness seems to prevail. Is it a warning? Perhaps yes. One needs to be cautious while reading him, specially this trilogy. It shakes one up; inside out to grasp the undeniable notion of the ultimate reality, to come face to face with it and let its voice enter inside you; a voice, which is constantly speaking to you, even if you are trying your best to ignore it. Is the experience fearful? I would say, no. It isn\u2019t. It is just coming to terms with the inevitable. But then question is, why such a difficult prose; a prose where there seems to be no definite start and no explicit end, which seems more like a babbling of a disturbed mind than a rational approach. The answer for me is well; Sam\u2019s writing is concentrated on the illustration of the idea of absurdism, as is apparent in his plays, and the writing here isn\u2019t seeking out the reasons for the absurdness but is rather a grave transport of complete resignation; a resignation arising from a deep despair which can only culminate into the inescapable (that which isn\u2019t obviously known). It reminded me of the \u201cMyth of Sisyphus\u201d by Albert Camus and the famous quote:\u201cThe Struggle itself is enough to fill a man\u2019s heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.\u201dThe delivery of the intended despair wouldn\u2019t have the same effect or wouldn\u2019t have touched so deeply, if the prose had been but undemanding.The trilogy starts with Molloy, moving on to Malone Dies and finally The Unnameable. It seems like a sequence, although there is no explicit reason to believe that. Only perhaps the impression of a cycle completed! In Molloy, there seems to be a plot, because there seems to be an action, a few characters with whom Molloy connects. Though being physically impaired, he is on the move always, in search of his mother. This much we know, because he tells us that. We know that he comes across a Policeman, and then a woman, whose dog is accidentally killed by Molloy but who still offers to care for him. Then there is another character of Moran, in the second part of book, who is on the look out of Molloy. He ventures out in his search with his son. Through a monologue by Moran, we are told about how the days are spent in search, how Moran seems to have killed a man (perhaps the same policeman, we don\u2019t know) and how he also comes across a man, who from the appearance seems Molloy. Towards the end of second part you even contemplate whether Molloy and Moran aren\u2019t the same persons. But it is not important, what holds you is the incessant working of mind, the statements stated with a complete submission. \u201cFor to know nothing is nothing, not to want to know anything likewise, but to be beyond knowing anything, to know you are beyond knowing anything, that is when peace enters in, to the soul of the incurious seeker. It is then the true division begins, of twenty-two by seven for example, and the pages fill with the true ciphers at last...\u201d In Malone Dies, Malone is awaiting his death. His movement is restricted as he is bedridden. He appears to be living in an asylum. To pass his time, he tells himself stories. The drivel which is carried on, in his mind, is an exercise in keeping himself occupied.\u201c So I wonder if I should go on, I mean go on drawing up an inventory corresponding perhaps but faintly to the facts, and if I should not rather cut it short and devote myself to some other form of distraction, of less consequence, or simply wait, doing nothing, or counting perhaps, one, two, three and so on, until all danger to myself from myself is past at last.\u201dBut it is the third one in trilogy, i.e. The Unnameable, where everything appears (so it seems) to come together. It sweeps you out of your mind. Yes, because here we don\u2019t know who is talking to us, it may be one voice or another and it may switch places. It can be Molloy, Malone, Murphy or Moran or still, one who is not known, hence, unnameable. Could it be someone who\u2019s been always there, from the very beginning; the beginning of times? Someone who has witnessed the coming and going (birth and death) of the likes of Molloys and Malones? This voice undoubtedly suggests this. But from where is it talking, i.e. if it is talking? The origin of the voice can be ascribed different places. It can be a grave, a place like heaven or hell, or it can be something in between, possibly inside a man, waiting to be released. But it certainly is coming after a death; death perhaps of Malone or Molloy, we don\u2019t know that. It witnesses the passing of both of them on an interval, but we don\u2019t know if the interval is regular. Now look at a quote from Molloy :\u201cAnd I, what was I doing there, and why come? These are things that we shall try and discover. But these are things we must not take seriously. There is a little of everything, apparently, in nature, and freaks are common. And I am perhaps confusing several different occasions, and different times, deep down, and deep down is my dwelling, oh not deepest down somewhere between the mud and the scum.\u201dAnd this one from Malone Dies:\u201cYes, those were the days, quick to night and well beguiled with the search for warmth and reasonably edible scraps. And you imagine it will be so till the end. But suddenly all begins to rage and roar again, you are lost in forests of high threshing ferns or whirled far out on the face of wind-swept wastes, till you begin to wonder if you have not died without knowing and gone to hell or been born again.......\u201dI wonder whether Beckett wrote these books one at a time or was he writing the three of them simultaneously. Molloy passes and then Malone passes too, both unaware of some other presence, which witnesses their passing and seems to be always there, a consciousness turned into a voice, perhaps waiting for its birth too. I also wondered whether Sam has tried to incorporate the concept of rebirth i.e. the birth cycle from Hindu philosophy, where a soul is consciousness and which never dies but is in the process of being born and dying as in a cycle.\u201cI hope this preamble will soon come to an end and the statement begin that will dispose of me. Unfortunately I am afraid (as always) of going on. For to go on means going from here, means finding me, losing me, vanishing and beginning again (a stranger first, then little by little the same as always) in another place, where I shall say I have always been, of which I shall know nothing (being incapable of seeing, moving, thinking, speaking) but of which little by little - in spite of these handicaps - I shall begin to know something: just enough for it to turn out to be the same place as always, the same which seems made for me and does not want me, which I seem to want and do not want (take your choice), which spews me out or swallows me up (I'll never know)...\u201dThere were some more quotes which I felt related. For example, Beckett says:\u201cMy master.\" There is a vein I must not lose sight of. But for the moment my concern..... (but before I forget: there may be more than one, a whole college of tyrants, differing in their views as to what should be done with me, in conclave since time began or a little later, listening to me from time to time, then breaking up for a meal or a game of cards)Doesn\u2019t it seem like waiting for the judgement before being born again? Beckett also employs humor here to express his disdain with God. He takes a few quips before arriving at conclusion that perhaps, He too, is working under some compulsion, that He is bound to do what He is supposed to be doing. Hence, He is not to be blamed. The end of the work is completely overwhelming, leaving one dazzled, as the writing reaches its culmination, asserting the need to go on, as there is but nothing else to be done, to be understood. The voice which may or may not belong to a man, the consciousness which may exist anywhere, anyplace, is subjected to the unfathomable because nothing is in one\u2019s hands, neither the birth nor the death, so while one may find it impossible to move on, for there is no purpose in moving, one has to move on. In the words of Albert Camus - Opening oneself to the benign indifference of the Universe - one must go on. \u201cYou must go on.I can't go on.I'll go on.\u201d"}, {"userName": "MJ Nicholls", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2386804-mj-nicholls", "userReview": "A venomous spate of reviewer\u2019s block has rendered me incapable of forming opinions on all novels over the last few months. So I will keep this simple. I am now a Beckett convert. The prose! The prose! Samuel, O Samuel. It has taken me some time to backslide into the charms of hardcore modernism (so accustomed to pomo as I was), but this threesome of existential novels that interrogate the thing of narrative itself (and thing of life itself) has opened me up to the power of that movement (perchance because these novels, esp. in the self-referential The Unnameable paved the pomo path). On the whole, I prefer not to make the same remarks as countless millions of Beckett lovers have made before, so I will limit this to ecstatic superlatives. Molloy: hilarious, surreal, fucking brilliant prose, infinitely re-readable, fabulous. Malone Dies: darker, more baffling, hilarious, fucking brilliant prose, infinitely re-readable. The Unnameable: maddening, insane, fucking brilliant prose, enough to leave one squirming on the floor in all manner of priapic fits of pleasure and pain. The prose, the prose!

I gave him my copy of the trilogy, and he made it about thirty pages. -I really don't see what's supposed to be funny, he said.-Well, I actually underlined the lines that made me laugh, I said-Is that what that is? I had no idea...My ex was an intelligent person; he had a vast knowledge of art history and fairly broad taste in books, but I fear he was hopelessly in love with beauty, health, youth. He just couldn't understand why a book like Molloy should exist.Beckett's art is often discussed as a formal reaction to Joyce and other modernists. While that's a valid approach, for me Beckett reads like a fairly straightforward realist. I've worked as a caregiver and companion to the dying. I've lived with tramps and homeless men, and visited prisons and mental hospitals. Absurdity is not a literary invention. Beckett writes about the shadow side of human existence, and does so with noble fidelity. And while death can never be experienced in the first person, the trilogy pushes about as far in that direction as can possibly be done.(Perhaps I should add that if you don't think Molloy's funny it's unlikely the next two books will cheer you up much. Just as Beckett's narrator grows less and less mobile, his language hollows out, shedding the delightful/icky wit of the first volume.) *3/22/16Seeing things in the world that make me think of Beckett. The other day I was biking home when I noticed a man walking in circles in the middle of a busy intersection. Cars kept having to swerve to avoid hitting him. I joined the small crowd of pedestrians that had gathered on the sidewalk. We called out to the man, \"Come here! come here!\" Sometimes he'd look at us, take a step in our direction, but then jerk erratically back to the street. A man in his forties. His eyes were glassy, a layer of sweat glistening on his face. After about ten minutes a cop car rolled up. To his credit, the officer really did an excellent job controlling the situation. Without using force, the cop was able to get the man to come to him, out of harm's way. And then the man finally spoke, and all he could say was, \"I'm scared.\" It occurred to me that while other writers might do a fine job describing the scene, or even recreating the man's life, no one but Beckett could really touch the depths contained in that simple  I'm scared*3/27/16 (Easter and, it so happens, the birthday of my nephew, who's now six months old, and while far from grotesque, quite the opposite in fact, at the moment his claim to personhood is somewhat inchoate or liminal, so perhaps it's not such a stretch to see him as a Beckett-like character or maybe the subject of one of Beckett's inimitable philosophical investigations) - this being the third time I've read the trilogy all the way through from start to finish. My awe undiminished. Beckett's masterpiece and certainly one of the books of my life. My first encounter was nearly 15 years ago, as a teenager who'd recently stopped believing in god. I could be cocky and defiant in my atheism, but was also prone to fits of depression. I'd look to books for solace. Beckett fascinated me. I was always able to appreciate his humor, but he could also be too extreme for my delicate temperament. When I read the trilogy it often felt like I was being taunted: Ha, see how ugly and meaningless it all is, this is what it's like to live in a godless world...Perhaps I'm stronger now, or else more lucid in my frailty. It's still painful reading at times, particularly the last 50 or so pages of the Unnameable - the most intense, suffocating, feces-smearing scream in literature, I'm glad that doesn't go on for too much longer, but I'm also grateful something so singular exists. Beckett's tone no longer strikes me as at all mocking or superior. There's no denying all the filth and despair on display here, but in the depths there are also strange moments of tenderness, as between Moran and his son or Moll and Macmann. I now see the trilogy as an act of solidarity with the cowardly, weak, wretched, incontinent, and insane - all of us, in the long run.Yes, I know they are words, there was a time time I didn't, as I still don't know if they are mine. Their hopes are therefore founded. In their shoes I'd be content with my knowing what I know, I'd demand no more of me than to know that what I hear is not the innocent and necessary sound of dumb things constrained to endure, but the terror-stricken babble of the condemned to silence.

Or was it Sarah? Edgar? I don\u2019t know. No matter.I could simply leave this as my review and summary of Beckett\u2019s trilogy of nothingness, but in the spirit of Beckett himself, \u201cI\u2019ll go on.\u201d Wow. Just\u2026. yeah, wow. I\u2019ve never read anything like this. Parts of The Unnamable at the end drift into what I call \u201cliterature of the black speech,\u201d which like Leautreamont and Kafka, end up like being some evil incantation in which reading is reciting; there\u2019s no meaning because the lines themselves embody the meaning, which here is nothingness or an attempt to achieve nothingness. Needless to say the attempt is a failure. YOU WON\u2019T BE TAKING THIS ONE TO THE BEACH, KIDDIES.What are we to do with Beckett? I read Murphy earlier this year, and enjoyed the holy hell out of it. It\u2019s Pynchon before the Pynch and better. Witty and intellectual and interestingly described and\u2026 All of those attributes are under totalitarian siege in the trilogy. We see from Molloy \u2018til the end of The Unnamable a gradual wearing down of thought until it is almost (but never quite) at its most primal level. Beckett\u2019s fav authors were Proust and Joyce. Both of those dudes wrote looooong books filled with words. In an essay, Beckett said Joyce had done all there is to do in transcending the word by use of words. I bet he looked at Proust and figured he\u2019d done the same with the ability to craft fictive scenarios chock full of characters and setting and furniture and all the rest (I guess I\u2019ll have to read his monograph Proust to find out). Beckett chided Rilke for thinking his \u201ccase of the fidgets\u201d had resulted in him finding God, when they were really just the fidgets. So we have an anti-transcendentalist, but nonetheless a transcendentalist at heart, sapped of traditional narrative ambition, seeking anti-transcendentalism in the absolute breakdown of the narrative psyche. For anyone, like me, that believes an author\u2019s works constitute a map of the author\u2019s mind, the treatise of Beckett\u2019s trilogy will be a specter that continues to haunt. The Muse herself is revealed for what she is: Nothing (with a capital N, which is something in itself\u2026#paradox) By the end of the trilogy, Molloy seems not only beautifully written, but copious in plot. That\u2019s an insane achievement in itself, worthy of the Nobel Prize. I agree with Leo Bersani, when he says in his essay \u201cBeckett and the End of Literature\u201d:The open-ended novel, ready to receive a rich variety of unpredictable extensions both from the author and his public, tends, as we have seen, to be narrowed into the predictable, excessively determined structures of pathological compulsions in Robbe-Grillet\u2019s work. Beckett\u2019s struggle toward unrelieved monotony and total inexpressiveness, on the other hand, has taken on a kind of bizarre heroism given his fantastic talent for stylistic and dramatic diversity.\u201d Insert anyone you like for Robbe-Grillet, be it Pynchon or R.R. Martin, or whoever. Beckett mastered these guys in his first book; it truly is heroic then, albeit in a brutal kind of way, to choose and continually attempt the antithesis of what most writers only dream about achieving."}, {"userName": "Banu Karayel", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54905203-banu-karayel", "userReview": "Fiziksel varolu\u015fun can\u0131 cehenneme art\u0131k s\u00f6zden m\u00fcte\u015fekkil bir varolu\u015fa merhaba!

My interest level throughout was all over the place, as the below graphic demonstrates:Reading this was similar to reading Proust -- I had to be absolutely ON while reading, or I'd lose the train of thought, and have to re-read paragraphs. And when there are literally 80+ page segments in here without a paragraph break, that becomes an ordeal. Sometimes I would get in the flow (mostly during Molloy and the first parts of Malone Dies), but other times I would just be reading words without understanding meaning.And honestly, I'm not sure I understood much in the way of meaning in general. I can get around the fact that there isn't much in the way of plot, characters, traditional storytelling devices, etc. Hey, I love the weird stuff. But I feel like you have to be in a MOOD to be able to read this. Some days, I just couldn't make it happen.Not that there aren't moments where it all came together, and I went A-HA! GENIUS! And it's pretty darn funny in spots, as well. But really, what IS all of this? What does it MEAN? I have no IDEA.Molloy seemed to make the most sense. Deconstruction of a typical novel. Cool parallels between characters who may be the same person. Funny stuff. But as the pages went by, I couldn't get anything out of the text, and stopped looking forward to reading it.At any rate, I think I failed Beckett here, and probably should try again in 10 years or so, when I'll hopefully be a better reader."}, {"userName": "K.D.

So, I might as well add it as a read book and add a point in my Goodreads' 2014 Reading Challenge. I liked all the three novels. Reading Beckett is totally like a different experience. I have been reading a lot and a couple of weeks back my eyes would just cry for not reason at all. The doctor and my wife both said that I am abusing my eyes by working (I am a workaholic) and reading (I am a bookaholic). So my eyes are oftentimes dry and so they cry to lubricate the surface of the eyeballs. Now I am using artificial tears (brand: Tears Naturale) to help in the lubrication. They (the doctor and my wife) suggested to refrain from reading too much but what can I do. I love reading and I still have the 3rd and 4th volumes of Samuel Beckett's Centenary Collection and the other 2,600+ books in my to-be-read folder (all inside my and my wife's bedroom). They are my treasured possessions. My distraction from the daily travails of living in a rat-race kind of life. This is one of the best trilogy that I've read ever. Well, it did not topple The Lord of the Rings in the no. 1 slot but this trilogy will be something that I will remember maybe forever. It is a joy to read. The first two have a recognizable plot about some kind of weird bicycle-riding boy Molloy (4 stars) and the second one has Malone (5 stars) who is dying in his cell, thus called Malone Dies but writing a book about a boy Macmann who like Molloy goes around and meets all interesting people and does a variety of weird stuff only Beckett would imagine. My only concern is book 3, The Unnameable (3 stars) because it just appeared as an afterthought of Molloy, Malone and all the other fictional characters that Beckett gave life to in his novels. It is just like capping the strong story lines of the first two books with beautiful words that felt like dramatic lamentations of goodbye.If you simply want to distract yourself from reading well-defined plots and enjoy the brilliance of a different post-modernist prose, go for this trilogy. Beckett is like eating in a French restaurant if you are an Asian. It's a feast for your eyes and nose. Asians have lots of eat-all-you-can restaurants. In those, there are so many choices and they will surely fill your tummy to the brim. When you go to Paris, however, you will rarely find buffets. You'll find artsy restaurant offering small servings of delectable and nicely presented piece of food served on a large white porcelain plate with nice decorations. It will also make you feel full but not to the extent that you would like to burp or run to the nearby toilet. You will feel some kind of class by paying a lot for a food that filled not your tummy but your other senses.That's Beckett for you."}, {"userName": "Natalie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/654799-natalie", "userReview": "Beckett definitely gets 5 stars from me, but he's not for everyone.

I don't think I'm as cynical or dry as SB and his antiheroes, but for some reason i really embrace them.

It is a synthetic whole, a synthesis synthesizing itself from disjoint elements of perception, body, state of mind, self-consciousness. The synthesis is effected by the continuity of memory and action, by transcendental apperception of self, by one\u2019s conscious idea of oneself, by reification in the gaze of the Other, and by a unifying conceptual framework, both one\u2019s own and that of the social whole. In his trilogy, Beckett examines this synthesis by dissolving it, revealing every element in a state of decay and breaking apart from the others.The first of the trilogy, Molloy, gives us two characters \u201ccrumbling...dispossessed of self.\u201d It dwells on their grotesque, painful, ever-rotting physicality, the errant extremes of their emotions. They are the kind of miserable, erratic individuals found in Dostoevsky and Hamsun, but here they are taken to their outermost limits. They are all ramblings and gesticulations. The first is a pitiful fellow, held together only with absurd routines and vague connections to his mother; the second, a cruel one, holding himself together by insistence on his own rules, by brutally lashing the world and the people within it with his will and his ideology. By the end, the latter character resembles the former: they have become the same by both dissolving into the minimal elements of human reality. Above all, neither can stop narrating: the narration, the telling of their own story, the use of words to circumscribe, to connect, and to unify: language, that body of concepts that defines the world and allows us our intersubjective relations, is the final thing maintaining their being. But the narration is cut apart, broken with comma upon comma upon comma splice, by ambiguity and rapid contradiction. Like everything else, it is crumbling.The second of the trilogy begins at the existential level where Molloy ends, telling a tale consisting solely of the ramblings of a dying man lying alone in a room. The man wonders where he his and what he\u2019s doing there. He speaks in \u201cquarter-truths, quarter-inclinations.\u201d He tells of the objects that define his being by being his: a stick and a notebook, for example. (He ponders how to define what belongs to him; this is as important as anything else.) He tells a story to amuse himself. His story makes little sense. Its protagonist changes names willy-nilly. By the end, it becomes poignant, telling of the rise and fall of a love affair and its grotesque physicality. By the end, the narrator and the character can\u2019t be distinguished. By the end, it matters little whether they are one and the same, because the narrator creates himself, exists as a pseudo-permanent thing, only in his telling, in his creation, of his own story.In the final book of the trilogy, not even characters remain. The movement toward stasis found in Malone Dies is complete: there are only thoughts thinking themselves, ever rambling but never moving. The unnamable narrator tells brief tales of himself sitting, forever immobile and incommunicative, in a chair, other people orbiting as planets about him; he tells of a character living in a jar in front of a restaurant, the joys of having a tarp placed over one\u2019s jarred head; he tells of a pile of mush with an eye, alone in a room, others peeking in. He is obsessed with the vacuity of words. They are always the words of others. Their meaning is questionable. But they keep spilling out. In one of the greatest stylistic moments I\u2019ve ever read, the novel ends with dozens of pages of great seas of run-on sentences sliced into horrifying, headlong rhythms."}, {"userName": "Szplug", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1843184-szplug", "userReview": "Mind-bending, breathless prose unlike anything else. Beckett's fascinating, disturbing, exhausting and droll depiction of consciousness\u2014stripped of all outside contact and reference points by the time we stumble, benumbed, into The Unnamable\u2014will definitely not appeal to everyone, but I found it hypnotic; even the third book, which friends (fans of the first two) had said was unreadable, drew me in with its relentless hyper-babble and I can't go on, I'll go on iterations.There's plenty of looping and heaving humor etched into the non-stop flow, in especial the sequence of the sucking-stones and the obsessive ordering of them in the pockets at hand in order to achieve mouth-time equality. Throughout the course of the three books the body becomes more and more of an irritating and alienated appendage, eventually to be misplaced and regretted no more than the bicycle of Molloy. There are also the tantalizing references to an austere and removed God and angelic messengers that send the narrating entities on missions for which the purposes are inscrutable, the means a further fragmentation of the physical from the mental, and the end result a more circuitous, tortured route for consciousness to end up back at the starting point, no further enlightened (indeed, even more confused) and stimulating the endless counter-measures by the naked soul to repel the nausea\u2014and quiet the abhorrence\u2014for existence that the pointless eternity of the now engenders.Definitely requires more than one reading, perhaps even reversing the order of the novels to experience Molloy's emergence from the echo chambers of the Unnamable, the Beckettian ontic proceeding from the ontological."}, {"userName": "Stephen P", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11602286-stephen-p", "userReview": "This book is bigger than me.

The last thing I remember it was two Sundays ago and I was thinking to myself, \"Huh, the next few days will be pretty bus\u2014\" and the next thing I knew I was waking up in a ditch by the metaphorical tracks while a bullet train composed of book signings, broken computers, early-morning and late-evening meetings, social calls and looming deadlines, raced past my throbbing head. In the far distance, receding all the time, I could just make out the tiny shapes of overlooked blogging commitments I had passed somewhere along the way.My commitment, for example, to re-read Beckett's could-be-called-a-Trilogy with blogging friend Anthony, who has by this late date posted his thoughts on both the first and second books. I can barely distinguish this commitment, way back last Wednesday, waving forlornly to me from a distant platform. I knew, though, that I wanted to take my time with this post even if it meant delaying, because Molloy, Malone Dies, and The Unnamable are among those books in my personal canon\u2014the ones which sustain me, which arrived in my life at a key moment and changed my ideas about what's possible in literature and even in life. The ones whose lines and rhythms and bizarrely beautiful narrative voices reverberate in my brain as I go about my days. This, for example:And I said, with rapture, Here is something I can study all my life, and never understand.Or this:And I myself will never lend myself to such a perversion (of the truth), until such time as I am compelled or find it convenient to do so. And I knew this swamp a little, having risked my life in it, cautiously, on several occasions, at a period of my life richer in illusions than the one I am trying to patch together here, I mean richer in certain illusions, in others poorer.This re-read of Molloy, hurried and fragmented as it was, lived up to all my memories. A two-part, cyclical work, it has the most plot of any of these three books, which incidentally is not very much. We get two sections, both narrated in first-person by two different (but not all that different) men: the first is the ancient Molloy, who recalls his own name with difficulty; the second is Moran, who believes he is an agent sent to track down Molloy. Both men set forth, one after the other, on torturous, convoluted journeys\u2014in many ways the same journey, since Moran attempts to follow in Molloy's footsteps\u2014in which they persevere in spite of mental vagueness and rapid, inexplicable physical deterioration. Both men become obsessed along the way by seemingly irrelevant details\u2014the best manner in which to suck sixteen stones in succession without sucking the same stone twice, for example. In the end both men, somehow, return to what we assume is their beginning point, although in both cases much has changed and this change exceeds their understanding.This is the classic Beckettian \"pointless journey,\" much like Mercier and Camier and Waiting for Godot. These are journeys in which a character seeks fiercely yet intermittently after something that never appears; something of which the traveler often loses sight or memory, which the reader suspects may not exist in the first place, and which the traveler would probably not reach even if it did. Yes, I was straining towards those spurious deeps, their lying promise of gravity and peace, from all my old poisons I struggled towards them, safely bound.I must admit that I find this construct oddly comforting, this idea that the objects of our obsessions are irrelevant to our overall experience\u2014or, if not irrelevant, they are related in ways not immediately obvious, especially as they often go unexamined for long periods of time and our minds and bodies do not cooperate with our stated aims. Molloy knows, although he sometimes forgets, that he is trying to visit his mother: an ostensibly simple task. But he is unable to remember why he wants to visit her; he can barely remember his own name and doesn't recall if hers is the same; he can't ascertain whether the town in which he finds himself is the one where he (and she) live, and he is prone to getting distracted for months or possibly years at a time, being taken in by batty old ladies, or washing up on the seashore for months, perplexed by the stone-sucking dilemma. Likewise, private detective Moran believes that he's pursuing Molloy: a straightforward tail job. However, he's not even sure if his object's name is Molloy or Mollose: most of his \"facts\" on the case originate in his own imagination; he devotes most of his energy to bullying his son and housekeeper rather than constructing a plan; and in the end none of it matters anyway, as his legs inexplicably become stiffer and stiffer until he can barely move at all, and he abandons the search for Molloy in favor of dispatching his son for a used bicycle. Nothing is accomplished and nothing is known. And yet in the midst of the despair and laughter at this futility there are glimpses of an abiding attachment to human life.I went on my way, that way of which I knew nothing, qua way, which was nothing more than a surface, bright or dark, smooth or rough, and always dear to me, in spite of all, and the dear sound of that which goes and is gone, with a brief dust, when the weather is dry.All this is rife with the hilarity and horror of being a) such a rickety contraption as a human, who must b) glean your understanding of the world through flawed sense perceptions, and your reality is moreover c) divorced from standard assumptions about cause, effect, and continuity, but you must nevertheless d) shape your experience into some kind of coherent narrative, or else cease to speak at all. Beckett's work is often called \"absurdist,\" but in my experience it's actually less absurd than most of us might like to believe. Instead, it seems to me an accurate picture of life without the mental filtering mechanisms we use to stay sane. The systems of habit and filtration we use to make sense of our world are so delicate and complex, and can veer off the rails with surprising ease\u2014yet we take them for granted out of necessity, because otherwise even the simplest task would be impossible. We pretend, for example, that we are the same person from moment to moment, when our reality may be more fragmented and unpredictable (\"A little dog followed him, a pomeranian I think, but I don't think so.\"). Or that we perceive the world and then narrate based on what we perceive, rather than creating or half-creating the world via our acts of perception and narration (\"I resumed my inspection of the room and was on the point of endowing it with other properties when the valet came back...\"). In the absence of these trusty shorthands, the task of communication, even with oneself, becomes daunting. I felt more or less the same as usual, that is to say, if I may give myself away, so terror-stricken that I was virtually bereft of feeling, not to say of consciousness, and drowned in a deep and merciful torpor shot with brief abominable gleams, I give you my word. Yet there is something in us which spurs us onward, so that we continue attempting until the very end, despite our inevitable failures and detours along the way. Despite the lack of externally-imposed meaning, and the gaping holes in any system we create to understand the world around us, we are compelled to continue trying, to continue shaping our narratives however we can, incorporating the contradictions and random-seeming obstacles that rise before and within us.And of myself, all my life, I think I had been going to my mother, with the purpose of establishing our relations on a less precarious footing. And when I was with her, and I often succeeded, I left her without having done anything. And when I was no longer with her I was again on my way to her, hoping to do better next time. And when I appeared to give up and to busy myself with something else, or with nothing at all any more, in reality I was hatching my plans and seeking the way to her house.Notes on Disgust(For more information on the disgust project, see here.)The subject of disgust in this novel would take another long post all on its own, and I have to admit that I often found myself swept away with the beauty and hilarity of Beckett's language to such an extent that I forgot to examine the sections that deal in disgust. They are there, though, and plenty of them. On my first read, I remember being struck by the repugnance of Moran's character, his cruelty to his son, and in particular the scene in which he gives his son an enema. There's also Molloy's allusions to the fact that he may have had sex with his ancient crone of a mother. On top of this is the obvious disintegration of both men's bodies throughout the course of their journeys; Molloy is elderly and Moran appears simply to be inexplicably disabled, but both are falling to pieces, and mixed up sexually and otherwise with other human bodies which are falling to pieces, such as the old whore who may or may not have been Molloy's one experience of \"love\" (whatever he means by that). At the time she approaches him, I was bent double over a heap of muck, in the hope of finding something to disgust me for ever with eating...If I were to hazard a hypothesis on not very careful analysis, it might be that disgust here is something unavoidable which must be accepted, no more or less \"meaningful\" than anything else in life (unless we make it so) and something which we are all bound to both feel, and to occasion in others. Molloy depicts an undifferentiated world, where questions and observations we normally filter out of our stories and our thoughts (why a person is not a landmark; whether we truly recognize our home towns) instead get dwelt upon compulsively and become ordering principles, substitutes for meaning. As such, the disgusting, which normally dwells in that undifferentiated mass outside normal boundaries, can be found wherever you look and is neither a sign of any particular quality, nor a deterrent to finding meaning there.And if ever I'm reduced to looking for a meaning to my life, you never can tell, it's in that old mess I'll stick my nose to begin with, the mess of that poor old uniparous whore and myself the last of my foul brood, neither man nor beast."}, {"userName": "Jeremy", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/869064-jeremy", "userReview": "Beckett writes from the edge. The voices (and they seem more like voices then characters) that narrate these books are those of wretches occupying some dying twilight world of their own dwindling consciousness, faced with their own immanent dissolution. They are literally just on this side of aphasia and death. The prose in each of these is singular. You could recognize one of Beckett's sentences in a heartbeat. There is, to my knowledge, just no one else who writes like this, or who would want to try. These three novels are books of sentences. Not chapters, not sections, not paragraphs, but of one skittering clause chasing after another in this dark, staccato style that seems to refuse any progression. They babble, repeat and curl back into themselves with the sort of logic you usually only here from sad, raving homeless people. Yet they are also weirdly affirming in spite of their darkness, you get the sense that these voices are forever circling the void, merely perpetuating themselves by some act of sheer will that is as futile as it is inevitable.

MOLLOY *****Nella stanza che fu di sua madre, Molloy, un vecchio ormai senza pi\u00f9 le gambe, guercio da un occhio e con molte rotelle fuori posto, scrive senza sosta, come un fiume in piena riversa sulle pagine quello che ricorda, o che crede di ricordare, o che vuole a modo suo ricordare del viaggio intrapreso nell'ultimo anno per arrivare a casa della madre (con cui aveva una questione da sistemare). Questo viaggio durato circa un anno, Molloy l'ha condotto entro i confini di una contea grande appena 5 chilometri quadrati, dapprima in bicicletta, poi sulle stampelle, infine strisciando.E' una narrazione fatta di reticenza, di confusione, di menzogne, di scoppi d'odio, d'indifferenza, d'introspezione frustrata e inutile, di osservazione della propria progressiva decadenza, d'autocompiacimento nella descrizione della propria lordura e sudiciume; \u00e8 capace di fissarsi a lungo, in modo ossessivo e persecutorio, su particolari del tutto inutili e allo stesso tempo di sorvolare del tutto altri aspetti senza ragione alcuna, su niente vuole gettare luce perch\u00e9 non ha alcun interesse a chiarire nulla, aspira piuttosto a una condizione ideale di felicit\u00e0, di pace assoluta, quella cio\u00e8 di sapere di non poter sapere nulla.Molloy naturalmente fallisce nel suo scopo, non arriva alla casa della madre se non dopo che questa \u00e8 gi\u00e0 morta ed \u00e8 stata portata via. Ma in fondo Molloy non aveva nessuno scopo e il suo agire alcuna motivazione o spiegazione. Cos\u00ec il suo fiume di parole si interrompe bruscamente in un fosso al limitare del bosco.Inizia qui una seconda narrazione, collocabile temporalmente pi\u00f9 o meno all'inizio del viaggio di Molloy. A scrivere \u00e8 questa volta un tal Moran, una specie d'improbabile agente segreto che, nella sua casa vuota e abbandonata, sta redigendo per il suo boss Youdi un rapporto sulla missione di cui era stato incaricato, cio\u00e8 rintracciare Molloy.Questo nuovo racconto si sviluppa in modo pi\u00f9 piano e tradizionale rispetto al primo, presentandosi questo Moran come un razionale. Tuttavia, se il caos della mente di Molloy si era palesato da subito, il viaggio nella testa di Moran diviene a poco a poco sempre pi\u00f9 sgradevole, in quanto questo puntiglioso detective nonch\u00e9 fedele frequentatore della parrocchia locale, si rivela essere un folle psicopatico e soprattutto un padre malato. Le pagine in cui Moran descrive il suo modo di rapportarsi con il figlio - e che occupano buona parte del racconto - sono a tratti insostenibili. In ogni caso, non solo la missione di Moran \u00e8 destinata a fallire, ma lo \u00e8 anche la sua narrazione che si impantana nei preparativi, nel viaggio di avvicinamento alla contea in cui Molloy vive e in episodi che in maniera sinistra ricalcano le vicende di Molloy stesso, tanto che Moran e Molloy sembrano simbolicamente avvicinarsi, se non addirittura sovrapporsi e confondersi l'uno con l'altro, finch\u00e9 non ci si domanda se non potrebbero essere la stessa persona.Se Molloy ci ha offerto un ritratto grottesco della condizione umana, riuscendo spesso a divertirci e a strapparci parecchie risate*, ridicolizzando qualsiasi nostra velleit\u00e0, cogliendo in pratica il ridicolo che c'\u00e8 nella tragedia, dall'altra parte Moran ci ha rivelato il lato pi\u00f9 disgustoso e inaccettabile della nostra follia e stupidit\u00e0 (seppure, a tratti, anche lui divertendo); e Beckett, da parte sua, ha probabilmente scritto un capolavoro, un'opera d'arte che \u00e8 un fare le capriole nel nulla, tessere una tela inesistente, per piantare poi il tutto in basso, molto in basso.\"Che volete, il gas mi esce dal culo in qualsiasi circostanza, sono quindi proprio obbligato ad alludervi ogni tanto, malgrado la ripugnanza che mi ispira. Una volta li contai. Trecentoquindici peti in diciannove ore, cio\u00e8 una media di sedici peti all'ora. Non \u00e8 un'enormit\u00e0, dopo tutto. Quattro peti ogni quarto d'ora. E' una cosa da nulla. Neanche un peto ogni quattro minuti. E' davvero incredibile. Via, via, non sono che un mediocre scoreggiatore\". ---------* Molloy porta in tasca alcuni sassi e di tanto in tanto li succhia per lenire la fame. Ebbene, signore mie, v'\u00e8 una tirata di parecchie pagine in cui Molloy cerca di stabilire un sistema che gli permetta di succhiare i suoi sassi a rotazione in modo da essere sicuro di non ri-succhiare mai lo stesso sasso che \u00e8 un pezzo di virtuosismo letterario (e talmente divertente!) come non ne avete certamente mai letto uno. Consigliatissimo anche ai pi\u00f9 convinti detrattori di Beckett.2. MALONE MUORE ****Ve lo ricordate l'Adorno dell'impossibilit\u00e0 della poesia dopo Auschwitz? Ebbene, al di l\u00e0 di qualunque cosa si possa pensare di quella sentenza, \u00e8 inevitabile, procedendo su queste pagine, ripensarci, impossibile non riflettervi e leggere la presente narrazione nella precisa ottica del non poter pi\u00f9 stendere narrazioni come si faceva prima, perch\u00e9 il protrarsi verso la morte di Malone ne \u00e8 la messa in pratica. Malone muore (1951) \u00e8 un'opera importante nella produzione di Samuel Beckett, la sua stesura segue a rotta di collo e in pratica senza soluzione di continuit\u00e0 Molloy e precede quella sorta di approdo che sar\u00e0 Aspettando Godot (1952), immediatamente successivo e precedente al terzo romanzo della cosiddetta trilogia, L'innominabile (1953). Se l'immane carnaio della II Guerra Mondiale segna la svolta creativa di questo autore - \u00e8 talmente palese, enorme, la diversit\u00e0 del primo Beckett da questo, che si pu\u00f2 parlare di due periodi nettamente distinti - e Molloy rappresenta forse la miglior testimonianza di questa svolta, Malone Muore ne rappresenta il punto di non ritorno. Malone attende la morte con neutralit\u00e0, non vuole accelerare n\u00e9 rallentare questo evento che definisce nelle primissime battute \"rimborso\". Esordisce, Malone, con un perentorio \"Non perdono a nessuno\", seguito da un augurio di una vita atroce per tutti. Stima arbitrariamente un residuo di 15/20 giorni prima di morire e pianifica il riempimento di questo lasso di tempo con la descrizione della sua situazione attuale, con la narrazione di tre storie (in un magistrale anti-climax: una prima storia con protagonisti \"umani\", una seconda storia con \"animali\", una terza storia con \"oggetti\", pietre) e con la stesura di un inventario dei suoi possedimenti.Malone giace in un letto, in una camera che ritiene sua, non ricorda come ci \u00e8 arrivato, si \u00e8 svegliato l\u00ec nel letto, prima il vuoto. Da qui cominciano le non-narrazioni di Malone che, in fondo, attraverso i vari personaggi che con la sua matita mette su pagina, non fa altro che tentare, fallendo, di raccontare sempre s\u00e8 stesso (come \u00e8 naturale che sia, come \u00e8 nella vita). L'infinito narrare che fin dall'antichit\u00e0 era un tentativo di tenere lontana la morte, un tentativo di salvezza, \u00e8 qui ormai senza scopo alcuno, essendo la nostra stessa esistenza una narrazione che non arriva a vedere la sua fine perch\u00e9 interrotta dalla morte.C'\u00e8 in questo Beckett il rifiuto di qualsiasi sospensione dell'incredulit\u00e0, la messa in scacco di qualsiasi narrazione affabulatoria, mistificante, falsa, c'\u00e8 una inquietante aderenza con la realt\u00e0. E cerca di farlo proprio uscendo dal linguaggio, per sua natura artificiale in quanto puramente convenzionale. In pratica si mette in un corto circuito sapendo di farlo. Ne risulta una voce, se vogliamo \"narrante\", che \u00e8 pi\u00f9 un brusio, un ronzio, il continuo rumore che fa la vita. In questo senso \u00e8 uno dei libri pi\u00f9 onesti che si possano leggere, davvero qui non \u00e8 possibile leggere semplicemente una storia, perch\u00e9 non c'\u00e8.Beckett, tutto sommato, esce da questo tentativo con successo. Non fa ancora il miracolo, quello lo far\u00e0 di l\u00ec a qualche mese, un anno dopo, con Aspettando Godot, la sua pi\u00f9 celebre pi\u00e8ce teatrale: dove non succede nulla ma dove riesce, incredibilmente, a coinvolgere e pure divertire il pubblico, e parliamo di pubblico medio, di massa, non di una spocchiosa frangia intellettuale. Probabilmente ci riuscir\u00e0 perch\u00e9 metter\u00e0 il pubblico stesso al centro del nulla che viene rappresentato e quindi il miracolo sar\u00e0 doppio in quanto \u00e8 assai difficile che un lettore/spettatore abbia il coraggio di aderire a quel tipo di verit\u00e0 che gli viene sbattuta in faccia, non esattamente facile da sopportare. Ma questo Malone che cerca inutilmente s\u00e9 stesso, questo uomo/libro, questa voce, questo inutile brus\u00eco che a un certo punto viene meno senza che per questo il libro abbia una fine - il libro non finisce mai, al limite tu lo chiudi ma poi lo riapre qualcun'altro, e cos\u00ec \u00e8 la tua vita che finisce mentre gli altri vanno avanti - \u00e8 una importante tappa di un percorso creativo che mette sincerit\u00e0 e onest\u00e0 prima di ogni altra cosa.3. L'INNOMINABILE *****L'imporante \u00e8 continuare, \u00e8 andare avanti, non importa con che cosa.Si va avanti. Una voce, un monologo. In fin dei conti dobbiamo evidentemente affrontare un insolubile problema di pronomi personali. Ma chi li ha inventati? Chi \u00e8 l'artefice di una tale sciagura? C'\u00e8 un io contrapposto a un loro, boh, ma perch\u00e8 non un lui, allora? Loro gli hanno insegnato alcune cose, lui non ha mai fatto attenzione o forse ha fatto particolare attenzione a non fare attenzione, per dimenticarsi tutto, ma inevitabilmente, contro la sua volont\u00e0 le cose rimangono, persistono, non ce ne si sbarazza mai del tutto e cos\u00ec le si utilizza. Prendiamo ad esempio le parole che gli hanno insegnato: quante combinazioni sono possibili con tutte queste parole, che discorsi, che frasi, che racconti escono dalla combinazione di queste parole! No, nessun racconto esce dalla combinazione delle parole, che cosa vogliono dire queste parole lui non lo sa, le usa perch\u00e8 gliele hanno insegnate ma non ha idea di che cosa vogliano dire. Il problema \u00e8 in realt\u00e0 un pelo pi\u00f9 radicale, certo questa voce sembra assumere sostanza, materia, addirittura gli d\u00e0 un nome, Mahood, poi anche un altro, Worm, ma lui \u00e8 veramente un tempo stato Mahood e poi \u00e8 diventato Worm? E dopo Worm, ancora, questa voce \u00e8 qui e non si sa se provenga da lui o d'altrove. E Molloy? E Murphy? E Moran? E Malone? E... Mercier!, non \u00e8 Mercier quello? E' cos\u00ec, ogni tanto gli passa davanti qualcuno, cio\u00e8 entra nel suo campo visivo da una parte e esce dall'altra. Che gli girino attorno in orbite pi\u00f9 o meno regolari? Finiranno per scontrarsi tra loro? O \u00e8 lui che gira? Di che diavolo stiamo parlando, di corpi celesti? Sono io che sono al centro con questi (loro) che mi ruotano attorno o sono io che ruoto attorno a loro? O loro sono l\u00ec, dietro alla parete che osservano ogni mia mossa attraverso fori per guardarmi. Che diavolo avr\u00f2 (ha lui?) di cos\u00ec interessante? Mi guardano diventare umano? Sono io che osservo gli effetti di tutto quello che mi hanno insegnato? Gi\u00e0, il problema \u00e8 davvero un pelo pi\u00f9 radicale. Cosa possono dire le parole di cui disponiamo, che ci hanno insegnato a usare? Cosa posso dire di me? E quest'occhio lacrimante, di chi \u00e8? O, chi \u00e8? Che cos'\u00e8 che piange?Per me, io mi fermo qui. E vi assicuro che sto bene. C'\u00e8 gi\u00e0 questo libro che va avanti al posto mio e forse ci sono io che posso leggerlo all'infinito. So che si dovrebbe continuare, lo so, ma mi fermo ugualmente.Opera dinamitarda, meravigliosamente estremista, L'innominabile \u00e8 un fiume di parole dotato di uno strano, stranissimo potere: quello di tenerti incollato alla pagina, di non permetterti di staccare un attimo gli occhi da queste righe forsennate nonostante tu ti perda continuamente, nonostante tu non ci capisca niente - ma questo non \u00e8 vero perch\u00e9 non c'\u00e8 niente da capire, in realt\u00e0 tutto \u00e8 chiarissimo. L'esperimento cominciato e portato avanti nelle due tappe precedenti giunge in porto, cio\u00e8 da nessuna parte, ovvero proprio qui dove ci sono io che annoto queste mie misere impressioni. La dissoluzione del personaggio \u00e8 definitiva, al punto che procedendo nella lettura, mentre stavo in guardia e credevo di scorgerne qua e l\u00e0 dei segnali identificativi, ad un tratto mi sono accorto dell'inutilit\u00e0 di quel che stavo facendo, anzi che proprio stavo sbagliando tutto, che non potevo leggere come al solito, che il discorso era ormai andato ben al di l\u00e0 di una eventuale riflessione \"sul personaggio\". Era rimasta solo una voce, il personaggio non c'era pi\u00f9 e io stavo osservando qualcosa di simile al moto dei corpi celesti, o quello degli elettroni attorno al nucleo dell'atomo. Una voce farneticante, inconcludente, balbuziente, completamente superflua e inutile, anche se questa \u00e8 una serie di aggettivi del tutto inadeguati a descrivere questa voce, perch\u00e9 sono appunto aggettivi, hanno la pretesa di evocare delle qualit\u00e0! B\u00e0h! Non sar\u00e0 che questa voce, questo rumore di fondo continuo che \u00e8 questo libro, sia la cosa pi\u00f9 aderente alla realt\u00e0 che ti sia mai capitato di leggere? Gi\u00e0, proprio come in Malone ma con qualcosa in pi\u00f9, c'\u00e8 un ingrediente segreto che Beckett ha versato in queste pagine. Ha, in qualche modo misterioso, qualcosa a che fare con la geometria: come fosse la proiezione ortogonale delle parole qui contenute che intersecando il piano delle pagine balzano fuori sotto forma di solido. U\u00e0u! Forse \u00e8 cos\u00ec! S\u00ec! Dammi un cinque!Il linguaggio \u00e8 pura convenzione, \u00e8 privo di contatti con quello che ti circonda che, di fatto, \u00e8 senza nome. E allora di che cazzo parli con questo linguaggio di cui disponi? Boh, magari fai una roba cos\u00ec, tipo questo libro, che forse ci va un po' pi\u00f9 vicino (a quel che ti circonda) di qualunque altra ingannevole storiella da leggere."}, {"userName": "Dan", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan", "userReview": "Brilliant. If you have read Waiting for Godot, Beckett\u2019s famous play, you will recognize his style of writing in these three novels.Beckett was the most famous of the existential playwrights/writers that comprised the Theatre of the Absurd genre. In all of these novels, we are immersed in existentialism. His writing is more minimalist compared to Joyce, who he was often compared to. Beckett once commented that instead of adding to the descriptions he removed words so he could take a different path than Joyce. Here is a very brief synopsis of the three novels. I don\u2019t think I have given away any spoilers here as the stories are all existential and a bit absurd and open to a fair amount of interpretation.In the first novel, Molloy, we see the ruminating of what seems to be an old man confined to his room. He is at times fixated on his mother, who is probably dead, and other memories. Later we see a thread emerge through the eyes of a detective who is traveling across the countryside. It seems by the end of the story that the detective and Molloy are maybe the same individual. Five stars. This story evokes a fair amount of empathy. In the second novel, Malone Dies, a man is confined to an asylum of some type, is taken with some other patients on a day trip to an island. Traveling by a horse drawn wagon, some strangers are picked up. An accident occurs and they are eventually transferred to the boat and several people are stabbed. They eventually continue on to the island. Five stars. Very vivid story. Reminded me a little of One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest.In the last novel, the Unnamed, we see a thread that is largely a stream of consciousness full of contradictions and absurdity. There is not much of a story per se here. This was not my favorite story but the theme was true to the title. So there is a quality to Becket\u2019s writing that resonates for me. He is at his best when writing about nothing important or simply the mundane such as in Malone Dies when he describes the importance and the look and shape of a pencil.\u201cSo little by little my little pencil dwindles, inevitably, and the day is fast approaching when nothing will remain but a fragment too tiny to hold. So I write as lightly as I can. But the lead is hard and would leave no trace if I wrote too lightly. But I say to myself, Between a hard lead with which one dare not write too lightly, if a trace is to be left, and a soft fat lead which blackens the page almost without touching it, what possible difference can there be, from the point of view of durability.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Sentimental Surrealist", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9707921-sentimental-surrealist", "userReview": "Language is a real son of a bitch. On the one hand, it's an essential part of human communication, the most common way we use to get our emotions and experiences across. Yes, there's much to be said for a visual approach, but even paintings and sculptures can be boiled down to words: in fact, there are plenty among us who dislike pieces of visual art because they don't appear to convey anything that can't also be conveyed by words. In fact, language (along, of course, with technology, but some could argue that technology springs from language) is the number one thing separating us humans from the - for lack of a better term - \"lower animals.\" On the other hand, despite being an essential component to human existence, language is also imprecise. We all know what it feels like to lack the proper words to express something: some of my more intense experiences with psychedelics have definitely fit under this label, as have, on a more mundane level, those times when I just can't say what I want to. We all know what it means to miscommunicate, to lose our train of thought, to think faster than we can speak. And if any idea is at the center of Beckett's trilogy, it's the idea of this contradiction behind language: so vital, yet so flawed.In my readings, I've stumbled across the theory that every Beckett play is about confronting God, God as this terrifying, merciless force that creates and destroys. Well, I'm gonna postulate a little, and say that the \"God\" behind Beckett's Trilogy, isn't the deity-as-we-know-it but a more primal conception of it: language, the Word Made Flesh. I'm going to theorize that Beckett wants us to understand that there isn't a hell of a lot of difference between Camus and Kafka's absurd-world God who's just as flawed as his creations and language, a powerful force that's almost impossible to understand and yet one that nonetheless suffers from crippling flaws. Consider the anxiety felt by the Unnamable, who wants to stop talking and yet cannot. Or consider how Malone tries and fails to tell both his own story and the story of Sapo, and consider how this ties into Molloy's inability to simply tell the tale of his journey in a coherent fashion and express his mother's mental state, which in turn ties back to Moran and his obvious parallels with Molloy, his future self that he is nonetheless looking for (the snake eats its own tail), which ties back to the fact that many characters in this trilogy are crippled (i.e. unable to express themselves without aid, and even those aids fail them in the end), which ties back to...Look. I recognize the potential for either futility or redundancy in what I'm doing, since here I am trying to communicate the fact that this book is about the things we can't communicate. This is rapidly becoming a self-reflexive mess, and I get that not everybody likes self-reflexive messes. So let me, if you don't mind, make a quick jump to the point: while Beckett's trilogy may at first appear to be abstracted beyond the level of meaning anything, but ends up revealing something essential about the human experience. Beckett isn't the most elegant of writers - he's strange and unsettling and has a seriously dark sense of humor (but is undoubtedly funny; just don't be surprised if you find yourself wondering why you're laughing) - but the insight, originality, and vitality of this work, whose surface I'm sure I've only just scratched, is astounding. An astounding achievement by any standard."}, {"userName": "Forrest", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/811928-forrest", "userReview": "I read this on a long train trip from Chicago to Salt Lake City and back several years ago. It was an excruciating read, difficult, a real grind. When I finished, I felt that I had read a masterpiece of literature (I had!), but the experience was so painful that I only gave it four stars. Now, after I skim it again, the images and experience comes back in a flood, but with only a modicum of the pain. It's an incredible, exhilirating feeling, tinged with a very slight pinch. What an incredible piece of art. It's time to fill in that fifth star and consider a re-read.

Except that the terminal station was reached with Watt, a book that pushes its audience's tolerance far further than these three. So why the pullback? Why return to Purgatory, as if Beatrice and the flower-drain of circling angels had never existed? My guess is that, like many experimenters, Beckett needed to reach his end before he could go back and synthesize it into the less punishing Molloy, which really is an incredibly beautiful book, and maybe the one novel of B's that I can take utterly seriously. Beckett tries to reduce the novel to its essentials, but the novel is inherently inessential, and resists. Malone Dies is interesting sentence to sentences (Beckett is always interesting sentence to sentence). The Unnamable, not so much. Our author is unforgiving, or at least has created a theater of unforgivingness (a real word: I just looked it up). An inquisitor lurks, a thinner man inside the thin one.

There is no old-style plot in any of them. Somehow, this is exactly what gave Beckett recognition. What we get here is accounts of long interior monologues of three highly miserable and unreliable characters. Also the narrator in all three is physically challenged due to different reasons (injury, old age and deformity) and also probably mentally challenged. There are hardly any links between the three novels except that the narrator of third claimed the creation of first two but he also claimed the creation of another novel - Murphy (which I haven't read). The novels ride completely on back of Beckett's unusual narrative style - completely absurd, often self-contradictory, explaining very obvious activities in a great detail and a very sad, pessimistic and dark humor - some of these things are common to most of Beckett I have read.I have reviewed them separately too but here are some examples of prose to be expected:Self contraditory:\"A little dog followed him, a pomeranian I think, but I don't think so.\"\"I found my bicycle (I didn't know I had one) in the same place I must have left it.\"Dark humor:\"I don\u2019t wash, but I don\u2019t get dirty. If I get dirty somewhere I rub the part with my finger wet with spittle. What matters is to eat and excrete.

Samuel BeckettIn the first novel, the unreliable narrator recounts his decline but through the monologue, the reader learns not so much his past as declining state of mind. From his phrases and sentences, we realize how far he has departed from reality and how little we can trust his words. And even Molloy couldn't trust his recollection of events and his perception of world. In the second part of the first novel, the narrator Moran, a private detective searching for Molloy, follows a similar decline into delusion and his world becomes as unreal as Molloy's. As if they are the same person. In Malone Dies, an old man confined to an asylum recounts his story and that of a boy named Sapo. But here, as in Molloy, the unreliable narrator conveys not so much the events as his delusion and decline. And we see Malone's death on the last page of the novel through the paragraphs and sentences distorting into fragments to reflect the narrator's last thoughts.\u201cLemuel is in charge, he raises his hatchet on which the blood will never dry, but not to hit anyone, he will not hit anyone, he will not hit anyone any more, he will not touch anyone any more, either with it or with it or with it or with oror with it or with his hammer or with his stick or with his fist or in thought in dream I mean never he will neveror with his pencil or with his stick oror light light I meannever there he will nevernever anythingthereany more\t\u201d from Samuel Beckett's Malone Dies.Beckett's Birthplace, Foxrock, Ireland (Photographed by Sarah777)In The Unnamable, the narrator asks \" What am I to do, what shall I do, what should I do, in my situation, how proceed?\" As if only a nameless person, perhaps a nonexistent person, can seek to act and to live. The narrator claims to have created Molloy, Malone and other characters in Samuel Beckett's novels, and like them, he also struggles to communicate reality and follows the same path toward non-existence. Beckett's trilogy is a postmodern fiction, not a meta-fiction but a story where the plot collapses and character and, even more so, style dominates. Through the narrators' babbling and occasional insight, through the fragmented thoughts and distorted sentences, we learn about their psyche, isolated and delusional.

Molloy is by far the best, and I would actually recommend it. It's consistently funny and entertainingly weird. Malone Dies becomes tedious, but still has some wit about it. The Unnamable (I recognize this is by now a very old pun) is nigh unreadable. It drones on, repeating the same thoughts in pretty much the same words, for so long that you start to consider dropping whatever class you're reading it for (if it's not for class, you don't get that far in before you stop reading it).The received wisdom about these novels seems to be that in them, Beckett is removing, piece by piece, the traditional elements that novels are supposed to have. Already in Molloy, a coherent plot and relatable characters are absent. We don't have to question everything our unreliable narrator tells us, because he questions it right after he says it! To the point that this becomes irritating and you wish he could just lump all those statements into one broad disclaimer at the end (e.g. \"I don't know whether any of what I have said is true\"), and save us all a lot of time.Next, in Malone Dies, plot of any kind has gone missing. We're treated to a single, long monologue of a character who says he's dying and doesn't seem to know much else about himself. We learn all about his room (he's bedridden), and he tells us several stories as we wait for death (his or our own, whichever comes first). The stories aren't as good as the ones in Molloy.Finally, in The Unnamable, character, plot, setting, and any reason to read the book other than to say you've read it, are all MIA. At this point, if not earlier, it has become apparent that some at least of the traditional elements of a novel are there for a good reason and shouldn't have been thrown out. If you are a being constituted similarly to myself, you may begin to read this book out of curiosity, but it will require compulsion to cause you to finish it.inb4 \"Dude, you were supposed to hate it, that's the whole point!\""}, {"userName": "Ellie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2908629-ellie", "userReview": "Like getting drunk on words in a vacuum."}], "description": "The first novel of Samuel Beckett's mordant and exhilirating midcentury trilogy intoduces us to Molloy, who has been mysteriously incarcerated, and who subsequently escapes to go discover the whereabouts of his mother.

In the trilogy's second novel, Malone, who might or might not be Molloy himself, addresses us with his ruminations while in the act of dying. The third novel consists of the fragmented monologue - delivered, like the monologues of the previous novels, in a mournful rhetoric that possesses the utmost splendor and beauty - of what might or might not an armless and legless creature living in an urn outside an eating house.
