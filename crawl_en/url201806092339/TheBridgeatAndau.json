That explains why Michener, a historian of enormous breadth and critical understanding, chose storytelling, and much of his backlist is historical fiction, telling the stories of history through the people who lived it. The Bridge of Andau is not a novel; Michener was present at the Austrian border to greet and assist Hungarian refugees of communism in 1956. The flight occurred in November of 1956 and this book was first published in March of 1957. The book reads almost as an extended news report, but with the natural novelistic flow of Michener's best epics. He does a tidy job of explaining Hungary's recent history of political subjugation, its long history of tensions with every one of its neighbors, all framing the current crisis (as of his writing) of the people's revolution over communism, told from the varied perspectives of Hungary's industrial workers, intellectuals, KVO members, and children. The Michener of 1957 doesn't know that the Soviet presence is not removed until as recently as 1991, although his plea for Hungarian sovereignty does help to stir the pot, so that even today the government leans toward a socialist-liberal agenda with democratically elected leaders and membership in the EU. Reading this book really helped me put a chronological order to the long list of -isms that have plagued so many nations of Eastern Europe. It also illustrated some extremely powerful and disturbing images of exploited power and war."}, {"userName": "Checkman", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5117003-checkman", "userReview": "Knowing that this was a product of the Cold War era I still had high hopes for this book, but the propaganda weighed it down.I didn't expect Michener to get all the facts since he wrote it shortly after Hungary was invaded in 1956, but I like primary sources. They often provide an immediacy that is lacking in later publications. Sadly this one was too immediate. It was nothing more than a piece of Agitprop ,which is odd, when one considers that Agitprop is credited to the Soviet Union and Communism. Anyway the book is overheated and strikes me as something that one would have found in an issue of Life or Esquires back in the 1950's. So ,while of mild historical curiosity, it isn't that great of a read. I won't be keeping this one."}, {"userName": "Julie Daines", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/651002-julie-daines", "userReview": "I don't normally read non-fiction, and especially I avoid war non-fiction.

The decision to annex Bosnia in 1908 and then use the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand as a pretext for declaring war on Serbia (in an attempt to consolidate the hold on Bosnia) led to WWI and the deaths of millions of people. In the post-war political turmoil, Hungary shifted dramatically to the right and formed an alliance with Nazi Germany. In WWII Hungary declared war on several of its neighbouring countries, and hundreds of thousands of Hungarian soldiers took part in the invasion of the Soviet Union, an invasion in which 25-30 million Soviets died. During WWII about half a million Jews were sent from Hungary to Nazi death camps. Michener either ignores all of this or touches on it briefly here and there without expanding. Instead he clumsily tries to paint a picture of a brave nation, a proud nation, a nation of heroes, who were oppressed for no reason whatsoever by a mixture of Soviet conscript soldiers and Nazi-collaborating homosexuals who only joined the secret police to take revenge on the boys at school who were better at sport than they were.He then accuses the Soviets of creating clumsy propaganda, without realising that this is exactly what this book is. It would be interesting to put this next to a similar book written by someone who fled the CIA sponsored coup in (insert name of one of dozens of countries here), if only to see if that writer did as poor a job as Michener did. I would not advise against reading this book, it does have value when placed in context, but viewed in isolation, it\u2019s appalling."}, {"userName": "Ciro", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75784492-ciro", "userReview": "I only made it through about 80% of this book\u2014not because it was boring, it just started to repeat itself.

I would probably have given this book a higher rating if Michener hadn't chosen to display some depressingly era-appropriate but no less disturbing homophobia in his composite picture of the 'bad guy' of this book: a typical member of the AVO (Hungarian secret police). I suppose he wanted to add extra moral weight to his image of the AVO as an evil, twisted, and degenerate organisation, but from a more modern perspective it reads like an especially ham-fisted condemnation of 'deviated preverts', who appear to be the only people who flourish under communism.I certainly don't discount the evils carried out by the communist system, and have no reason to suggest that the sufferings of the Hungarian people under that system should be in any way downplayed. Yet Michener's account of events veers into outright sensationalism and, dare I say, agitprop in its most negative form, and should be read alongside an account of the uprising that is more deserving of the name 'nonfiction'."}, {"userName": "Daniel", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1639207-daniel", "userReview": "A must read for anyone who attends a state sponsored school.

First, he does tell several stories of the events in Budapest in a competent and occasionally gripping way (his account of how the \"revolutionists,\" as he calls them, managed to destroy so many Soviet tanks is pretty riveting stuff). His focus on individual values and the struggle for personal freedom in the face of massive state totalitarian tyranny is also well-done (with a caveat I'll get to in a moment). In fact, it's that part of the book that makes this volume still particularly timely, albeit we are facing a different form of totalitarianism today, one that is more subtle and insidious than Michener and his Cold War companions could ever possibly have imagined (as is demonstrated in his complete misunderstanding of the nature of modern imperialism displayed in his record of arguments with Asian students in the penultimate chapter). But it's in this thing that he does well that, paradoxically, lie the seeds of the undoing of his work in this particular book (and in much of his other work more generally). For Michener fundamentally (and probably willfully) distorts the category \"communism\" beyond any logically precise definition. Sometimes he uses \"communism\" to mean Soviet-style state capitalism (which is how most of the critics of his day, and even still today, think of the word). If he stuck to that definition his argument would be stronger, but he can't help attempting to throw other forms of western Marxism into the \"communism\" catch-all; when he does this he ends up tripping over his own words (sorry for my own tangle of metaphors...). He claims (at the same time, mind you) that Hungarians overwhelmingly rejected \"communism\" by fighting the Soviets and their imposed Hungarian security service (the AVO), AND ALSO that many of those who fought remained \"communist\" in their beliefs and wishes for the post-Soviet evolution of their state (for example, the continued collectivization of farms and farm machinery, which Michener is forced to call \"an acceptable liberal policy\"[!]). Is it possible that Michener really didn't see that there is a difference between socialism and Soviet-style \"communism?\" Perhaps (and many academics continue to make this same error by refusing to closely analyze the socioeconomic formations of the Soviet state). But to my mind, this sort of argument reads much more like Cold War propaganda along the lines of many of the things J. Edgar Hoover had written in the previous decade before this book was published. Along these lines (and probably because of them) Michener is laughably wrong in his attempts to generalize and extrapolate the consequences for \"communism\" in the world after 1956. This, of course, is somewhat understandable (who can perfectly extrapolate from events so recent?), but what I find not comprehensible (what I might even call hypocritical) is Michener's later failure to write in such scathing terms about the totalitarian regimes sponsored by the US in, for example, Chile, El Salvador, and Nicaragua. Where are Michener's volumes condemning these atrocities? At least in Hungary there were hundreds of thousands of survivors walking across the border into Austria. Where are the disappeared from Central America that the US had a hand in burying in shallow graves? Where is Michener's outrage about those lives lost? Ultimately, this book fails because of Michener's own propagandizing and lack of imagination (or integrity). It's a low point in the career of an author who, in many other respects, had a depth and breadth of vision that continues to astonish."}, {"userName": "Ray Ziemer", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5931665-ray-ziemer", "userReview": "My copy of \u201cThe Bridge at Andau\u201d by James A. Michener sat around my junior high classroom for years as part of the schoolroom library. To my knowledge, not a single student ever read it; nor did I, until I picked it off my bookshelf last week. I should have read it a long time ago.I learned a lot of startling facts about the brief and violent Hungarian Revolution, but what I can\u2019t get out of my head is the realization that these events took place when I was eight years old. On October 23, 1956, a demonstration by young workers against the communist regime in Budapest escalated into a full-blown rebellion. For twelve days of violence and exhilaration, the people of Hungary fought the state operatives known as the AVO and their Russian overlords. Originally they were protesting the authorities who had promised a worker\u2019s paradise but delivered a police state. The violence increased, as those oppressed by the communist elite cried out for freedom. They had seen their country\u2019s wealth and the products of their own factories shipped off to Russia, while they struggled to avoid poverty. Michener tells the story based on first-hand accounts of freedom fighters from many different walks of life: intellectuals, office workers, factory workers, students. These were the people who fought police and paramilitary forces and eventually burned hundreds of Russian tanks in the streets of Budapest. Their triumph of course was short-lived. After twelve days, Russian forces regrouped and attacked the city in strength, destroying buildings block by block and wiping out the resistance.In those days thousands of refugees ran for freedom, many of them crossing the border on a rickety footbridge over a canal near the Austrian town of Andau. That\u2019s where Michener and other journalists met the survivors and heard their tales of terror and valor. The author can never be accused of objectivity in this book. He viciously attacks the Hungarian communists and holds nothing back in his contempt for the Russians. He makes much of the fact that the rebellion was fought by the very workers the communists thought they had indoctrinated \u2013 loyal workers betrayed by the corrupt system. The youth of the nation also heeded the call. Hundreds of Russian tanks were destroyed by fighters under 20 wielding homemade gasoline bombs.Nearly two hundred thousand refugees reached Austria in those days after the Russian attack. The Hungarian freedom fighters who had listened to Radio Free Europe and hoped for help from abroad were disappointed. Yet Michener spins the story as a Russian defeat. Writing just a year later, in 1957, he sees Russia losing the battle for the souls of young people, workers, and peasants. He extols the struggle as a warning to other satellite nations, and as wake-up call to socialists in Western nations and around the world. Of course we know that the communist hold over Hungary grew tighter and more vicious, with retribution and executions, and the country suffered many more years before experiencing the freedom that generation fought for. This twelve-day rebellion made little impression on me and most Americans in the 50\u2019s. It was forgotten amid Cold War escalations closer to home, tales of Berlin Wall desperation, Prague Spring hopefulness, Southeast Asia and the Domino Theory. Michener, though, must have felt closure in 1990 when the communists ceded control to a democratic government and Russian troops left the country. Certainly the end of the Soviet Era must have stirred some strong memories among those who didn\u2019t cross the bridge at Andau."}, {"userName": "Ali B.", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5296093-ali-b", "userReview": "James Michener was right there at the Bridge at Andau, watching and helping some of the 200,000 Hungarian refugees that fled to safety into Austria in the weeks following the five-day Revolution in 1956. The book was published just months later, and Michener goes to great pains to detail his reporting practices and dedication to truth, knowing full well that the incredible stories he recounts are beyond belief. He also understands that, in 1957, much of the world is still on the fence about the merits of Communism and whether Russia is as evil as the Americans say. For this reason, the Bridge at Andau serves as an excellent historical account of the Russian occupation of Hungary and mid-century American attitudes toward Communism and immigration. Michener is clearly worried about the spread of Communism, a fear that means next to nothing in 2018. So the book has a dated quality but it's one that serves the subject well, as it's a very honest account and analysis of Communism as it was in the 1950s. It's also a serious love letter to Hungary and the Hungarians. About two-thirds in, Michener admits he is decidedly pro-Hungary, a crush that began when he boned up on Hungarian history in an effort to play devil's advocate to his Transylvanian roommate's frequent rants against his former oppressors. That and Michener's experience in WWII and reporting on the Korean War and other Communist-riddled areas make him a biased-but-sincere narrator of the Revolution. The author is clearly fond of the Hungarian people, and occasionally lays on the praise a bit thick, gushing about the strength and character of these \"remarkably attractive people. Small, wiry, quick to anger, they have finely chiseled faces and bodies admirably adapted to games.\" Yet the thing is, I agree with him! I also recently fell in love with Hungary, first through studying it and then living there for three months. And, yes, Hungarians are hotties, at least the ones I met in Budapest were. But as a historian, Michener might have toned it down a notch for the sake of accuracy. I also cringed at how he rated the \"three waves of refugees,\" deeming the Second Wave\u2014the only one he actually witnessed\u2014as the one most worthy of emigration, because this group, he believes, held the most brave revolutionaries. (The first wave, he says, was prostitutes, ne'er-de-wells, and cowards, and terrible ambassadors of Hungary. The third wave, a full 175,000 of the 200,000, were, he says, not brave enough to fight in the revolution and jumped ship when the going got worse, thus did not earn the right to flee and are not befitting of hero refugee status.) Yuck. I finished this book the same day President Trump called Africa and Haiti \"shitholes\" and, indeed, Michener recounts likeminded racist words from mid-century American politicians who also didn't want dirty refugees from the shithole situation that was Hungary. (The United States was initially reluctant to accept Hungarians and greeted the first few arrivals very poorly. By September of 1957 we had accepted 35,0000 Hungarian refugees.) Michener does an awful lot of speculating about the future for Hungary and Hungarians, both in governing and social roles. This was likely a useful viewpoint in 1957, but today it feels quaint and much of his fears never came to pass. Yet, his observations are a useful study of American, or perhaps Western, opinion of refugees and Communism, and an exciting account of the Hungarian Revolution. I'm glad the author was alive in 1989 to see Hungary freed from Communism."}, {"userName": "Launette Shaw", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5424990-launette-shaw", "userReview": "I'm on a quest to learn about Europe.

When it came in on ILL, I decided I might as well put forth a good effort, and I was really glad I read it. I really like Michener most of the time, but his early episodic fiction and non-fiction tends to lose me, Pulitzer for \"Tales\" notwithstanding. With this one, it's a mixture of intriguing subject matter and authorial passion. Michener always wears his heart on his sleeve. He's good at injecting his opinions and analyses. Even if you don't agree with his bias, you have to appreciate that the man makes a point and discusses it well. Andau shines a light on a part of European history that a lot of Americans my age probably don't know much about: the communist Russian takeover and occupation of Hungary after WWII. Michener spent some time listening to and documenting stories from Hungarian refugees after crossing into freedom in Austria at a small, seemingly insignificant bridge at the village of Andau, Austria, and what he hears and reports is horrifying. True, this book is naturally dated, as communism in Europe is gone, but remnants of both its ideology and its horrors will perhaps always remain. What Michener documents here is no less horrifying than the holocaust and, in some ways, is more horrifying because communism as it was practiced in Hungary and many other nations cultivates a steady, longstanding state of complete mental and physical terror. Tens of millions of people died under communism, as we now know, and many are still suffering and dying in its throes today in North Korea, and now, as then, there are still pockets of ignorant philosophers in free nations who hold dogmatically to its ideals as if it could actually work. Michener argues against this in impassioned terms, not from a politically right-wing stance but from a heartfelt place where he cares for the survival and happiness of the human species.I'm glad I read this.

A popular historian and novelist, Michener's account of the Hungarian uprising awakens the reader to the shocking plight of millions who suffered the iron fist of communism and Soviet puppet leadership. The revolution was a rebellion of students and intellectuals directed against the Soviet occupation and communism in Hungary. Viewing the revolution as a threat, the Soviet Union mercilessly sent tanks into the city center of Budapest violently extinguishing the uprise. The Soviet destruction of a magnificent city left Budapest and the Hungarian people in ruin.Interviewing those who escaped Soviet repression in Hungary, Michener traveled to the city of Andau at Austrian-Hungarian border putting the courageous stories on record. The bridge at Andau was an escape route and path to freedom for Hungarian refugees fleeing across the border into Austria. For several weeks, Michener hovered at the border village of Andau as beaten Hungarians limped and staggered away from Soviet terror. Michener writes in detail about the domineering relationship between the Soviet Union and its satellite communist states. What was the catalyst that sparked the revolution and why did over two hundred thousand Hungarians cross the border and obtain freedom from Soviet domination?Arranged into a series of interconnected stories, The Bridge at Andau revolves around young students, intellectuals, and reformed communist political leaders. The novel opens on Tuesday evening, October 23, 1956, on \"a day which the world will be slow to forget\" (Michener, 1). Attracting thousands of protesters marching through central Budapest, the revolution began as students demonstrated in the streets calling out over Radio Free Europe shouting, \"Out with the Russians! Out with the Russians!\" (Michener, 17). Starting as a collection of students seeking to end repeated changes to their curriculum, the revolution quickly became a five-day rebellion of the Hungarian people. The protesters no longer sought educational reforms but wanted drastic change within the government. Reformers called for sixteen demands. The major objectives were Soviet troop withdrawal from Hungary, improved economic and living conditions, free elections, and the formation of a multi-party system.To gain control over the Hungarians, the Soviets infiltrated every aspect of the their lives. Some were Soviets sent from Moscow; however, many were locals promised special advantages if they would be the eyes and ears of the Soviet authority informing on their fellow workers and neighbors. \"Certain members of the party get all the rewards of society - the good apartments, the good radios, the good food, the best clothing,\" while the rest of the people starve (Michener, 14). Neighbors and friends were scared to talk to each other about the Soviet infiltration in fear of who might be listening and reporting back to Soviet officials. Living in perpetual fear, people sought change and wanted freedom. How did the Soviets structure of communism push many Hungarians, especially men, into positions within the government that they knew went against their best interests?The Soviets shaped young men to into communist leaders through constant bribes building a trusted inner core of elite communist leaders. The Soviets gave the young men power and promised a better life. These promises were so vast and unrealistic that it was impossible to obtain them. The false sense of hope drove young men into the communist party even though they knew the expectations could not be attained. Young men had little or no options other than to assimilate into the communist party. Anyone who openly opposed the Soviets were sent to violent torture camps in Siberia and never heard from again. Silencing the opposition ensured that the best of the best became communist leaders in Soviet satellite states.Michener keeps the book moving at a fast-pace recounting what life was like for those living in Hungary under Soviet communism. Communism promised, \"consumer goods such as they had never known before, increased wages, increased social benefits, shorter hours of work, improved education for everyone, a greater social freedom, and a government directly responsible to the working class\" (Michener, 116). With such a long list of promises, it is easy to see how the Soviets enticed the Hungarians into a false sense of possibilities. After two years of communism, the Hungarians realized the promises would never materialize and were living in continuous fear.Using the AVO, the brutal Hungarian secret police, the Soviets promoted terror and instilled fear in the Hungarians. Paid more than workers in the factories and given power over the people, the AVO routinely terrorized the Hungarian citizens. Strictly enforcing rules and regulations, the feared AVO police unleashed a reign of terror across Hungary. People were afraid of speaking out against the Soviets and many families went behind closed doors to educate their children about the harsh reality of communism.One of the most heart wrenching parts of the novel deals with the Hungarian children. Michener breaks this down across multiple chapters and is a continuous theme throughout the novel. The first has to do with children that were involved in fighting against the Soviets and the second deals with education of young children. Many adults used children in guerrilla warfare since they were small and agile. Unseen, children would scurry out into the streets and place brown dinner plates upside down. From inside a Soviet tank, these plates looked like mines. When the tankers stopped, children would sneak up and drop a homemade Molotov cocktail into the tanks engine. Repeated attacks against Soviet tanks sent the Soviet's into a temporary retreat. This demonstrates the lengths to which the Hungarians fought to save their country. The fight for Hungry involved everyone. The Hungarians fought for their country from the inside out hoping to push the Soviets back reclaiming their country.Dedicating two chapters about the education of the Hungarian children, Michener describes the lengths that the Soviet infiltrated the schools and how families counteracted the Soviet educational system. Inside Hungarian classrooms hung portraits of communist leaders. Marx, Lenin, and Stalin were the most popular and teachers emphasized the glory of communism. At home, parents taught their children Hungarian history, culture, poetry, and religious values. Parents put themselves and their children at serious risk from interrogation by the AVO. There was a constant battle between what was taught in school and what was learned at home. It was gripping to read how parents counteracted what was taught in the school system. The Soviets used education as a tool to push the communist agenda while at home parents taught their children what it was like to be a Hungarian.One particular moving story dealt with a little boy who was turning six years old. The boy's father proudly dressed his \"son in full national costume with an armband so big it could be spotted a block away\" (Michener, 166). The boy was spotted by a policeman and sent home to change. When the boy asked the officer where his national colors were, the policeman replied, \"I wear them in my heart\" (Michener, 166). This sense of national pride was necessary to the Hungarians and demonstrates why so many people were willing to die for freedom.Throughout the novel, Michener provides a humanistic quality of the Hungarian people while depicting historical events in an interesting narrative. Reading this I could picture young children participating in the fight for their country and students rioting in the streets for freedom. His argument that Soviet communism ate away at the fabric of society and ultimately turned on its self is compelling. The tipping point, the student rebellion, gathered momentum and eventually Hungarians saw their right to fight for freedom. The Hungarians had had enough of Soviet occupation and the reign of terror unleashed by the AVO. The countless stories of children and teenagers building their own weapons shows the reader how dear freedom was to the Hungarians. Prior to attacking the Soviets, one college student said to another, \"We will die here today\" (Michener, 71). There was not a single story were the Hungarian fighters felt they would make it out alive. Michener shows the reader how dear freedom was to the Hungarians and that they would die to gain freedom.Michener exposes the reader to the hardships the Hungarians dealt with on a daily basis. What many American's take for granted were luxuries by the Hungarians. For example, the black-market was the only place women could get makeup. \"Five or six girls would band together to buy one black-market lipstick and one flat cake of rouge\" (Michener, 48). If a girl wanted to go out with a specific boy, and wanted to look nice, she would have to borrow the makeup the girls shared. It was a luxury to go on a date four times a year. One particular woman, Mrs. Pal, was married but she still enjoyed a night out with her husband. In the words of Mrs. Pal, \"I looked pretty twice a year\" (Michener, 49).Purchasing a suit for her husband was also a challenge. Many times Hungarian men would wear the same clothes for several weeks and save for six months to purchase a new suit that was often previously worn by a Soviet and sold at an exorbitant price in a Soviet owned store. While saving for a suit, Mr. Pal was unable to take his wife out to the movies, go dancing, purchase records, or books. This is just one of several examples of the hardships Hungarians faced on a daily basis. Hungarians rationed their funds saving for items most Americans do not think twice about purchasing.Michener goes into great detail of the brutality of the Soviets against the Hungarians. From my knowledge of Eastern European history, I was aware of how bad the Soviet Union was. I knew that communism was evil and that the Soviets had murdered a lot of people while forcing their communistic agenda across Eastern Europe; however, it was not until I read this book did I realize just how evil and brutal the Soviet Union was. Michener composed his book from over hundreds of the 200,000 people that escaped across the Hungarian border into Austria over the bridge at Andau. Michener is very careful to backup everything he says and to substantiate the historical evidence he puts forth in the book. This is a really shocking book and a must read for anyone how loves freedom, liberty, and cares about human rights.As the novel progresses, Michener describes the whole story about the revolution, and one of the most amazing aspects of the novel was the detail Michener writes about how the Hungarians fought against the Soviets. It was incredible reading how the Hungarians fought with virally no weapons and without military training were able to destroy hundreds and hundreds of Soviet tanks with homemade weapons. Fighting for their country, a vast majority of these tanks were destroyed by young people seeking freedom from Soviet repression. The Bridge at Andau is an amazing story of heroism and courage.Traveling to Budapest three times, I gained a different perspective on the places I visited after reading the novel. At times, the narrative might seem disjointed as Michener jumps between perspectives, but after reading the novel, I saw the bigger picture. I understand the price the Hungarian people had to pay to gain their freedom from Soviet communist rule. Telling the story from various points of view provides the reader with a complete perspective without bogging down into too much historical detail. Each chapter builds upon the previous allowing the narrative to mesh together in one of the final chapters, appropriately named, The Bridge to Andau.The Bridge at Andau is a powerful read for those of us living in a free society. This is not just a story about Soviet-occupied Hungary, but all countries occupied by the Soviets after World War II. This is a story of collective desire for hope and freedom. The actual bridge at Andau is a small wooden footbridge the width of two people. Under the bridge is a shallow river and the water would come up to the top of an adults shoulder. Crossing the bridge at Andau represents the struggle the Hungarians went through to obtain freedom \"and if a Hungarian could reach that bridge, he was nearly free ... [and] by accident of history it became, for a few flaming weeks, one of the most important bridges in the world\" (Michener, 173). In contrast to what I had originally thought when selecting the book, many of the Hungarian refugees were young people with a purpose. The average age was around twenty-three. The evacuees were students from the best universities, intellectuals, professional football players, accomplished artists, and skilled engineers and scientists. Hungary was losing the elite of their nation at an astonishing rate. The Bridge at Andau is filled with vivid accounts of people fighting for their freedom. Michener gives an accurate account of what life was like under a totalitarian regime recounting stories from ordinary people. Infringements on people's freedoms are very real, and The Bridge at Andau highlights the motivations of why people fought back against Soviet communism giving a country hope for a better future."}, {"userName": "Ryan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7122119-ryan", "userReview": "James Michener\u2019s The Bridge at Andau details the Hungarian Revolution from the side of the revolutionists. His Western perspective influenced his interpretations, and his writing clearly reflects a contemporary cold war mentality. Sometimes exaggerating his depictions of life in Communist Hungary, he has clear anti-communist motivations present in his stories. The Hungarian revolutionists whom he interviewed were also responsible for the embellishments found throughout the novel, no doubt sharing similar concerns about communism with Michener. Michener uses embellished storytelling from a Western perspective and in The Bridge at Andau to warn against the spread of communism and encourage more committed American intervention in the Eastern bloc.\tMichener\u2019s overarching interpretation of events in his book is critical of communism; not once does it display the theory of government in a positive light. He depicts a vastly powerful, brutally oppressive communist regime pitted against defenseless innocents merely seeking the \u201cdecent life\u201d they could not hope to obtain in such a system (Michener, Bridge at Andau, 1). Early on, Michener characterizes the cold war mentality in the West: an intense fear of the spread of communism. He informs the reader that he authored the book \u201cin order to remind myself and free men everywhere that there is no hope for any nation or group that allows itself to be swept into the orbit of international communism\u201d (Michener, Bridge at Andau, 2). He repeated his message many times throughout his writing, warning that \u201cno matter on what elevated plane communism begins, it sooner or later runs into such economic and social problems that some strong-arm force is required to keep the civil population under control\u201d (Michener, Bridge at Andau, 132). Michener uses statements such as these to deter intellectuals in Western countries from pursuing the path of communism. Michener\u2019s Western bias toward the Hungarian revolutionists is at times obvious, as he denies the possibility that the theory of communism might have some validity. He injects his own commentary into the events portrayed in the book, making it clear he has an agenda: utilizing pathos to inform the minds of others against communism. Michener\u2019s descriptions of the political prisons and the sadistic torture the prisoners endured are especially poignant: without cause, men of the AVO would subject prisoners to heinous, sometimes unspeakable, attacks that would humiliate, damage organs, or even kill. He also appeals to the empthasies of the West, recounting families who could not afford to buy a second outfit of clothing, let alone a car, or how married couples could never save up enough to own a wedding band. Appeals such as these would likely disenchant many contemporary Westerners who were contemplating communism as a viable political theory. Soviet communists of the time used propaganda extensively to control perception of the regime, and Michener was motivated to combat their attempts. Leading communists of the 1950s claimed that their system of government workedaccording to a plan, but Michener contradicted this statement with a huge number of examples of how the communist system oppressed the proletariat and benefitted the higher classes within the regime. One man recalled radio announcements describing how communism exalts the worker and enriches one\u2019s life (Michener, Bridge at Andau, 30). Contradicting this notion, Michener depicted the working class as destitute, often unable to afford even the most basic necessities, and told of how the near-ubiquitous presence of the secret police drove people into an ever-narrowing world of propaganda and restrictions on speech. Michener wants the reader to believe that virtually everyone under communism rose up against the system when the revolution began: \u201cOut of 15,000 workmen on whom communism depended for its ultimate support, only forty remained loyal.\u201d (Michener, Bridge at Andau, 162). Statements such as these, which are likely exaggerations, are helpful to his goals of demonstrating the ultimate failure and rejection of communism in Hungary, but they are disingenuous as they do not depict the real motivations behind the revolution\tThe Hungarian government transitioned to communism in the backlash of the fascist Nazi regime of World War II, and communism was actually quite popular among the people, albeit with some helpful manipulation from the Soviet Union; Stalin had little interest in giving up Hungary. Largely speaking, it was not communism that sparked the Hungarian revolution, but heavy-handed Soviet domination. Michener himself wrote the revolutionists complained chiefly about Soviet troop's occupation of Hungary and the export of goods and resources from Hungary to Russia. In reality, the people sought to put in place a more liberal form of communism with more freedoms and to rid themselves of the Soviet occupation; it was more of a Hungarian nationalist uprising against Russia than an uprising of the people against the government system of communism. Michener neglects to make this significant distinction, and instead uses the revolution to signify the peoples\u2019 rejection of communism: \u201cThis was communism itself, rejecting itself. This was a solemn foretaste of what communists in India or Italy or France or Indonesia would themselves conclude if they ever had the bad luck to live under the system\" (Michener, Bridge at Andau, 168). By interpreting the basis of the revolution in this manner, Michener is able to warn against the spread of communism in the West, which clearly reflects the cold war mentality in the West: an intense fear of the spread of communism.\tIn addition to attempting to discourage the spread of communism, Michener\u2019s book is also highly critical of the lack of military support from America during the Hungarian revolution. He uses an interview with a Hungarian man to convey that Hungarians were misled by American radio that broadcasted rhetoric of freedom over the airwaves into communist countries. The man passionately argues that \u201cIf America wants to flood Eastern and Central Europe with these words, it must acknowledge responsibility for them. Otherwise you are inciting nations to commit suicide\u201d (Michener, Bridge at Andau, 259). Michener pleads with the reader to \u201crethink our attitudes in the cold war,\u201d asserting that America will have no excuse for not militarily supporting the inevitable revolutions in Eastern Germany or Poland, as Americans \u201cwill have been warned that men do take words seriously\u201d (Michener, Bridge at Andau, 259). Thus, not only does Michener use The Bridge at Andau to warn against the spread of communism, he calls for America to take a more active role in providing military aid to countries looking to overthrow their communist leaders, rather than simply broadcasting messages of freedom.\tMichener\u2019s Western-influenced storytelling with subtle embellishments serves to tell the heroic story of the Hungarian revolution against their communist leaders. These exaggerations serve to demonstrate an overwhelming rejection of communism by the Hungarian people, casting light on the pitfalls of a communist system and warning against the spread of communism in the West. Additionally, he explains the influences of American radio, which broadcasts messages of freedom into the Eastern bloc, and calls for America to provide military support to countries which begin revolutions as a consequence of this influence."}, {"userName": "Maria Louise Schreffler", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50257593-maria-louise-schreffler", "userReview": "Real-time Account of the Hungarian Uprising in 1956First, this is not a work of fiction. While Michener changed most of the names of the people he interviewed for their safety and the safety of their families, all of the events actually happened. This book offers very good insight into what happened in Budapest in the fall of 1956. Most of the population rose up against the Hungarian communist government. After a few days of freedom and planning for life after communism, the Soviets stormed the city with thousands of tanks and heavy artillery, reducing much of the capital to rubble. The revolution was crushed, and a mass exodus ensued. Michener talked to hundreds of refugees that escaped to Austria and recounts their stories in this book. He took great pains to verify the stories. While most of us of a certain generation are aware that the Soviets \"invaded\" Hungary (and later Czechoslovakia), I have never read so much detail on why the people revolted, who did the fighting, and that for a brief period of time, it looked like happy days for Hungary. I visited Budapest last year, and wish I had read this book prior to my trip. I will need to go back now and visit some of the areas discussed in this book.I didn't give the book 5 stars for several reasons. First, it was published within months of the events that took place, so it lacks historical perspective. Secondly, one of the last chapters is Michener's beliefs of how communism is doomed to fail. While Soviet communism and the Iron Curtain did indeed fail, communism is alive and well in China and North Korea, so he got it wrong there. Finally, realizing this was written in the 1950s, I was disappointed that he clumped homosexuals and people with intellectual disabilities into what he called \"deviants\" when describing the tour of person who works for the Hungarian secret police (AVO). I hope the world is more enlightened now."}, {"userName": "Bronze", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/72494468-bronze", "userReview": "The Bridge at Andau is a compilation of viewpoints from Hungarian refugees that depicts the struggle of the Hungarian revolution against the Russians. The book also highlights the heroism shown by the unprepared Hungarians and their fight against the Russian powerhouse and all of its lies and propaganda. Michener made the book so that the world could be informed about the massacre of the Hungarians. I was disgusted by the way Russia treated the Hungarian people by their lies and enslavement of the people as a whole. The Hungarian people lived in constant fear of being tortured if they are found speaking poorly of the communist regime. Hungarians workers were paid minuscule amounts which made buying clothes and even food expensive. This would lead to starving Hungarians ratting each other out to Russian spies called the AVO in turn for food. I ended up feeling exuberant when the Hungarian people rioted against the cruel system. If you have the curiosity to learn about the gruesome stories and injustice that took place during the Hungarian revolution, then this book will demonstrate the corruptness of Russian communism. One of the ways Hungarians are treated badly by the Russians is when during the revolution, Russian soldiers are given the order to kill anything that moves. This leads to the slaughter of many defenseless children and women. Another example is when fleeing Hungarians are captured and then sent to a camp called Recsk. At Recsk, prisoners were beaten and tortured just because the guards enjoyed watching them suffer. In one case, a prisoner is beaten so badly that he doesn\u2019t notice when his hand is literally being burnt off."}, {"userName": "Erik", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4960377-erik", "userReview": "The story told is an important one, and one worth knowing. For that reason, I am glad I read this book.However, the way it was told was a little disappointing. For one thing, the author had some odd turns of phrases or oddly constructed sentences, and it took me a few re-reads to understand what he meant. Also, some of the words he used didn't mean what I believe he thought they meant.Another problem was that the story felt rather disjointed until the end. Sometime the author would switch from one situation to another or from one character to another mid-chapter with little or no transition, and the result was a bit jarring.Finally, I feel like the author wanted to convey the miniature stories within in an exciting way, and so parts of it read more like a novel. However, it was also important from him to relate the reality of the situation, and sometimes facts would be laid out as if in a history book. There is a balance to be found in doing both things together or side-by-side, but Michener couldn't find that balance.So I won't be reading any more books by James A. Michener. I'm not happy with the way he wrote this book, but I appreciate being exposed to this part of Hungary's history that I had not known before."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/700589-laura", "userReview": "I've long been interested in this part of the world, and wanted to read more about its political history. This book tells the story of the Hungarian uprising of 1956 and its rapid suppression by the Soviets. It's made up of vignettes about events throughout the city and at the Austrian-Hungarian border. Michener acknowledges in the afterword that he fabricated some of these stories from things told to him by multiple informants, and that he did so to mask their identities and thus protect family members they had remaining in Budapest. But knowing this does weaken the impact, I think, of the narrative. Michener's writing style is also really, really biased, and often reads like anti-communist propaganda. Sometimes it's specifically anti-Soviet propaganda, but by and large, he really seems to be trying to discredit communism as a political and economic system generally, not just the specific problems that led Hungarians to rebel in 1956.

It was the widespread fear and anger against the AVO which helped spark the popular uprising. Tales of torture and abuse at the hands of the AVO are many and disturbing. The revolt was short lived however, with Russian tanks and troops regaining control before long.Many thousands of citizens were able to escape to neighboring Countries during the revolt, and especially to Austria over the Bridge at Andau.
