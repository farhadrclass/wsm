For Your Eyes Only contains the following stories:1. From A View to a Kill2. For Your Eyes Only3. Quantum of Solace4. Risico5. The Hildebrand RarityThe first three titles would probably be familiar to anyone who has watched more than a couple James Bond films over the last 20 years. The only issue is, they are only BARELY (if at all) recognizable. They share the title with the films, but that is about it. And that isn't a bad thing. I rather enjoyed the three movies, but the stories here are (for me) more nuanced than most of his books and all of his movies. Fleming is experimenting a bit. He is upping the literary and dialing down a bit the adventure. Not so it isn't recognizable. They are still all Fleming novels and ALL James Bond stories. But they each, in different ways, bring a bit of humanity into the Bond collection."}, {"userName": "Carmen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen", "userReview": "[ Bond comes to deck to find Krest dead, the fish he was searching for stuffed into his mouth. Bond suspects both Liz and Fidele, even though it seems clear to me that the woman did it. I guess Bond suspects Fidele as well because he is Creole and Bond thinks they have hot tempers. And Krest was needling him pretty hard. Liz offers to sail with Bond on the yacht for a few days. Bond thinks she may be a murderer, but he accepts without hesitation. As I have said before, Bond respects people who defend themselves and he understands when people do what they have to do to survive - no matter how ugly. If she did murder her husband, Bond actually would respect her a lot.Bond cleaned up the murder. He cleared all evidence and threw the body overboard. He says it's because he didn't want to be caught up in a police investigation. But I know it's because he hated Krest and thought he deserved what he had gotten.

What a film. 1981 was quite a year at the movie-house: Arthur, Das Boot, Gallipoli, Chariots of Fire...and this. The movie doesn't follow the book's plot particularly closely, adding stuff from another short story, inventing stuff...but what the hey, why should this one be different?It's a standard revenge-action-espionage flick. Nothing in space, some stuff underwater that makes some kinda sense, and the best Bondmobile ever: A Citro\u00ebn 2CV! from Wikimedia on a Commons licenseSo yeah, being a little sarcastic there, but this film brings out the snark in me. Simon Templar does his smirking best as Bond. The man's just about as sexy as beans on toast.But the reason I watched it again, after not liking it in the theater in 1981 (a horrible year in my life, which probably had a lot to do with my response), is the fact that this is Bond as a SPY! An actual espionage agent. It's refreshing to see, after the previous decade's endless progression of villain-fighting. That got tedious. Carole Thingummy, as Melina, was ~meh~ but the story was more involving and less superhero-suspend-all-disbelief-ye-who-enter-here and so a big relief to see.Sheena Easton sang For Your Eyes Only, another ubiquitous Bond theme. It was wearing after a while, but it was memorable. I suppose modern audiences, desensitized by the horrors of hoop-pup and elektronika and suchlike nonmusic, will feel that way about Adele's blah, forgettable Skyfall. Bah. She's better than that.Oh yeah, For Your Eyes Only. Decent, if only just, and worth a rental."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1895570-jim", "userReview": "Is it possible to write effective short stories about spies? When I started reading Ian Fleming's For Your Eyes Only, I thought, \"Ho, ho! I can't see where this'll work.\" In fact, none of the five stories are, strictly speaking, spy stories. No SMERSH, no SPECTRE, and only a couple mentions of the big bad Soviets. In \"From a View to a Kill,\" James Bond patiently finds who murdered a SHAPE courier by becoming one himself and luring the assassin.The title story is a plain and simple revenge murder at M's behest of a gangster who killed two dear old friends of his in Jamaica.My favorite story is \"Quantum of Solace,\" in which 007 finds out from the governor of the Bahamas why it is not such a great idea to marry an airline stewardess.\"Risico\" finds Bond trying to help the Americans nail a European drug dealer -- except that the enemy turns out to be an ally; and the ally, an enemy.Finally, \"The Hildebrand Rarity\" contains an unsolved but utterly deserving murder of a cruel American billionaire. These five stories are as good as anything Fleming has written."}, {"userName": "Handan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6342835-handan", "userReview": "Having grown up engrossed by the James Bond films (with one or two exceptions...you know which Bonds I mean...), I was curious as to how the original novels would rate. I have come away from my second Fleming fascinated, if not thoroughly impressed. The films accurately capture how scattershot Bond's life is--he hops the globe the same way he breathes, seemingly indifferent. However, the novel far surpasses any film in that we see Bond's logic and internal monologues, complete with banal asides and notes of the local atmosphere and environs, something sadly lacking on the silver screen. As well, (go figure) Hollywood ratcheted the sex appeal more than a few notches; at best in the novels Bond glances at a girl and analyzes her. Any reference toward sexual activity is merely hinted and left to the reader's imagination. While the story never captured my attention (Hollywood does a cleaner job of connecting all the dots of and tying them all back to one super-villain), Bond novels may become my summer reading of choice."}, {"userName": "Jesse A", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21013603-jesse-a", "userReview": "As with all collections of short stories, the quality varies.

It was bound to happen that eventually there would be a collection of stories that included titles of movies my brother and I haven't (re)watched yet. As I held this in my hand, flipping through it, I panicked. How do I do this? I wondered. Do I read just For Your Eyes Only since that's the movie we most recently watched? And then check the book out again for, say, A View to a Kill? And then again for Quantum of Solace?It was a bit overwhelming. So I didn't read this for a while. Because I was paralyzed with options.In the end, I just sucked it up and read the whole book because a) it's not like I'm being graded on this project and b) this is for my own shits and giggles, no one else's and c) I fail miserably at not finishing a book once I've started it. So, whatever, I'll figure something else out after we watch A View to a Kill and Quantum of Solace and whatever else is totally ruined for me because I read the story first which is not what this project is about anyway.I really sort of liked the movie of For Your Eyes Only. It's painfully 1981, but Carole Bouquet is absolutely stunning, and I dunno, there's something about watching men in Members Only jackets running through the woods that makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Oh, and Julian Glover. I mean, really.From what I understand (ie, Wikipedia), the movie was based on two stories in this collection - obviously the title story, but also Risico, in which Kristatos (Glover in the movie) really shines.The stories in this collection are actually rather good, which is surprising because that's hardly what I expect from Fleming these days. I would probably argue that these stories are stronger than his longer novels. That's unusual, right? Maybe because they're shorter stories, Fleming needed to really focus on what he wanted to portray, what he wanted to say, and how he wanted to execute those thoughts. They felt like tight little packages.I actually like what the movie folks did with this film, combining those two stories. I would have liked to have read the book that I feel should have been For Your Eyes Only and Risico together. The movie combined them so well that I'm sure the story as a whole would have been pretty fantastic as well.Did I mention the movies was undeniably 80s? The theme song was sung by Sheena Easton. I think that says it all, doesn't it?Next up...

There\u2019s some exciting action and amusing observations, but they don\u2019t really add up too much. However looked at together, they do show some interesting things about Fleming\u2019s conception of his lead character. For example: \u2018Quantum of Solace\u2019 \u2013 which is certainly the most passive Bond tale I\u2019ve come across so far, in that all he does is sit there and listen to a story \u2013 sees Bond at the end gripped with ennui. He has the realisation that, for all the glamour and danger, his job is inconsequential when compared to normal people\u2019s everyday lives. When you read that tale \u2013 placed right in the middle \u2013 you remember that sense of weariness in \u2018From a View to a Kill\u2019, before encountering the strange rumination on murder and revenge that is \u2018The Hildebrand Rarity\u2019.Of course there are the normal Bond traits, an underground base in \u2018From a View to a Kill\u2019, exploding yachts and shoot-outs in \u2018For Your Eyes Only\u2019. And so if you just dipped into the collection and read the stories in whatever order over a long period, you might miss the changing sense of character that runs through this book. Fleming didn\u2019t subscribe to the \u2018super-hero\u2019 Bond of the movies, but going through this collection it\u2019s clear that he was happy to undermine a lot of that heroism which surrounded even his version of Bond. (I saw the film of For Your Eyes Only recently, and it does mark the point where Roger Moore starts to look really old. [Anyone not in Britain, put the words \u201cRoger Moore\u201d and \u201cPost Office\u201d into Youtube and see that there are some fates which even being James Bond can\u2019t save you from.:] The main Bond girl looks young enough to be his daughter, while the secondary Bond girl \u2013 who positively throws herself at him \u2013 looks young enough to be his granddaughter.

There is, for my money, more tension in the climactic moments of From A View To a Kill and For Your Eyes Only, and even the seemingly unassuming subject matter of Quantum of Solace is written in such a way as to draw the reader into it as with the other stories. There are enjoyable nods to the usual Bond fare \u2013 beautiful women unable to resist his charm, familiar locations and references to the Cold War nemesis that we are used to Bond battling."}, {"userName": "Missy J", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7406091-missy-j", "userReview": "2017 Jamaica Challenge #1: The National Bird of Jamaica is............On the colorful book cover of this Ian Fleming novel, you can clearly see the bird. \nThe most beautiful bird in Jamaica, and some say the most beautiful bird in the world, is the streamer-tail or doctor humming-bird. The cock bird is about nine inches long, but seven inches of it are tail - two long black feathers that curve and cross each other and whose inner edges are in a form of scalloped design. The head and crest are black, the wings dark green, the long bill is scarlet, and the eyes, bright and confiding, are black. The body is emerald green, so dazzling that when the sun is on the breast you see the brightest green thing in nature. In Jamaica, birds that are loved are given nicknames. Trochilus polytmus is called 'doctor bird' because his two black streamers remind people of the black tail-coat of the old-time physician.\n Ian Fleming, the author of the James Bond stories, wrote most of his works in Jamaica. This was the first time for me to read a book by him and I'm quite surprised how James Bond is depicted more complex than in the Hollywood movies. Also, M is a man in these short stories (I'm only familiar with the female M in the movies). This book contains 5 short stories:From A View To Kill: Set in Paris, this action-packed short story was too fast for me. It wasn't clear who the villain was, but at least James Bond is revealed to also have some self-doubts. One star *.For Your Eyes Only: Set in Jamaica and the US-Canadian border. The book is named after this short story and is about revenge and the professional vs personal motive to kill in the spy world. Bond girl Judy Havelock appears. Three stars ***. Quantum of Solace: Set in the Bahamas. Bond gossips with the Governor about an infamous former stewardess who had to pay dearly for betraying her husband in Bermuda. Uncharacteristically, this short story doesn't include any action. Four stars ****.Risico: Set in Italy. Bond is sent to investigate the burgeoning drug smuggling trade in Venice and to kill the top leader responsible. Things get messy very quick, no one is who they seem and the mission that unfolds in surprising ways. Action-packed and suspenseful. Four stars ****. The Hildebrand Rarity: Set in the Seychelles.

In \u201cFor Your Eyes Only,\u201d Bond tracked a vicious war criminal to the forests on the U.S./Canada border, where he subordinates his deadly mission to the quest for vengeance of a grieving young woman. \u201cQuantum of Solace\u201d cast Bond as the audience for a tale of the ways a mismatched married couple visited cruelties upon one another. \u201cRisico\u201d dropped Bond into the world of Italian drug gangs, in a desperate quest to cut off the heroin supply to England. And in \u201cThe Hildebrand Rarity,\u201d Bond endured the company of a rich, bullying American in the search for a rare aquatic specimen, before things took a violent turn.Ian Fleming was rightfully celebrated for his Bond novels, but the author was a deft hand with the shorter format, too. There\u2019s a certain charm to seeing these tales boil down and focus on essential elements of the franchise, freed from some of the more complicated plot structures of the novels. \u201cFor Your Eyes Only\u201d is probably the most typical \u201cBond Story\u201d here, with its kill mission and espionage games. But it also was the rare glimpse of the personal loyalty Bond had for his enigmatic boss, M, who had a personal stake in the case. \u201cFrom A View To A Kill\u201d showed off Bond\u2019s intelligence and ability as an investigator, while also spotlighting some of his more entertainingly roguish characteristics. \u201cRisico\u201d was an excellent action piece that also made strong use of the period\u2019s crime elements.The other two entries are somewhat less expected. \u201cThe Hildebrand Rarity\u201d spotlighted the franchise\u2019s ability to transport readers to an exotic locale most would likely never visit (a group of small islands in the Indian Ocean, near the Seychelles), but also almost entirely jettisoned any sort of espionage underpinnings for a brutal turn of events rooted in a complex interpersonal dynamic. \u201cQuantum of Solace\u201d was the most offbeat entry of all, featuring nary a single action beat. Bond was cast in the role of listener, taking in a story of domestic emotional warfare from a fusty colonial governor that engaged the spy in spite of himself.At their best, these stories illuminate particular qualities of Fleming\u2019s famous anti-hero, whether spotlighting his complex, at times contradictory, moral code, or his ability to enjoy or deplore a variety of different cultures. His devilish sense of humor popped up at times, while other stories took a more stone cold approach. Whichever setting Fleming used, he always found some way to illuminate a facet of his lead, which is the true strength of the collection. As usual with this series, a modern reader needs to be prepared for some period-accurate attitudes about racial and gender characteristics that aren\u2019t exactly in step with contemporary views.And yes, that blasted Sheena Easton song will echo in your brain whether you want it to or not.For Your Eyes Only isn\u2019t the most essential entry in the Bond series.

Of the 14 Fleming books featuring the exploits of the world's best-known secret agent, only \"For Your Eyes Only\" and the author's posthumous \"Octopussy\" (1966) consist of short stories, and the five collected in this earlier volume are a particularly good batch indeed. Two of them had been published previously; the other three were originals for this volume. All feature what is popularly known as the \"Fleming Sweep\"; the ability of the author, through fast pacing and a remarkable amount of picturesque detail, to make the reader accept even the most improbable of scenarios. And although two of these stories are not exactly espionage tales per se, they all provide insights into the fascinating character that is the literary 007.The collection starts off strongly with \"From a View to a Kill,\" in which Bond is given the task of finding out who has been murdering governmental dispatch riders on their motorbikes and stealing top-secret documents. The tale takes place in the suburbs of Paris and features some exciting gunplay at the conclusion, as well as an intriguing female ally, Mary Ann Russell, who we unfortunately do not get to know overly well.In the title story, \"For Your Eyes Only,\" Bond goes on a personal mission for his boss, M, whose old friends, the Havelocks, have just been killed by an ex-Gestapo agent named von Hammerstein and his Cuban hitmen. In the northernmost wilderness of Vermont, Bond finds these men in a mountain lodge, and (as in the 1981 film, which otherwise is completely different from this story) encounters the Havelocks' daughter, hot on the vengeance trail herself. The suspense quotient in this tale is very high, as Bond uses all his commando skills to sneak up on the villains' lair, and, as in the collection's first story, an explosive finale caps things off. A most satisfying tale indeed.The book's third offering, \"Quantum of Solace,\" originally appeared, of all places, in the May 1958 issue of \"Cosmopolitan\" magazine. This is a most unusual story in the Bond canon; indeed, it is one that is narrated TO Bond by the governor of Nassau, where 007 had just completed an assignment involving Cuban revolutionaries. The governor's after-dinner tale concerns a couple that he once knew in Bermuda society; one whose marriage went sour after infidelity, jealousy and bitterness poisoned it. It is a fascinating story of domestic hell, and one that makes Bond realize that his (previously regarded) exciting life may be a little dull when compared to some others'.In \"Risico,\" M, much against his will, condescends to involve his Secret Service in drug busting, and sends Bond on a mission to Rome and Venice to smash the heroin ring that had recently started to corrupt British youths. Bond encounters two rival smugglers in Rome, Kristatos and Colombo (again, two characters that feature in the \"For Your Eyes Only\" film, in a wholly different context), as well as the mysteriously motivated Austrian Lisl Baum (ditto), and participates in a ship raid on a drug-storage warehouse. The story is fast paced and generally exciting, and features an incredible amount of travelogue detail to add to its realism.The collection concludes with \"The Hildebrand Rarity,\" which initially appeared in the March 1960 issue of \"Playboy.\" Like \"Quantum of Solace,\" this is not really a secret agent tale, but rather an adventure that Bond is involved in, after investigating certain security arrangements in the Seychelle Islands for the British Admiralty. He and his friend Fidele Barbey (similar to the Quarrel character in 1958's \"Dr. No\") are hired by a boorish American millionaire, Milton Krest (a completely different character than the one portrayed by Anthony Zerbe in 1989's \"Licence to Kill\"), to go on an expedition to capture a rare tropical fish for the Smithsonian. Aboard Krest's luxury yacht, Bond meets Krest's attractive and abused wife and gets involved in a sudden murder. Fleming's love of scuba diving yields effective results here; his detailed descriptions of undersea life are both gorgeous and evocative. This story, although lacking any real action per se, features wonderful characters, great suspense and a nicely ambiguous conclusion. Like \"Quantum,\" it is an unusual Bond story that succeeds marvelously, bringing to a conclusion this rather winning collection of (as the book's subtitle puts it) \"Five Secret Exploits of James Bond.\" The book should serve as proof positive that novelist Ian Fleming had a sure hand with the shorter form as well. It is required reading, needless to say, for all fans of 007."}, {"userName": "Scott", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6948799-scott", "userReview": "For Your Eyes Only is a collection of short stories by Ian Fleming, featuring the exploits of fictional Secret Service agent 007. The book contains five short stories which rather like the featured novels of earlier work picked up with Bond on a mission and acted like a quick glimpse into his world. It was a great change of pace for the most part and an enjoyable read. The themes that I found to run throughout are that of Justice, revenge and morality. Bond questions his role as an agent and assassin in these books in a subtle take on his feelings rather than a grand epiphany you may expect.From a View to a Kill: This was my favourite of the five. Bond investigates the murder of a motorcycle dispatch-rider and the theft of his top-secret documents. The immediate change of pace from the opening lines from Goldfinger had be wishing that this was its very own novel and not just a short story. It\u2019s a sharp conclusion and full of action and suspense throughout For Your Eyes Only: The title story for the novel. The focus shifts from Bond to M in this one. When the Havelocks, personal friends of M, are brutally murdered in Jamaica by two Cuban hit men. M sends Bond on a voluntary assignment to kill the man who sent them. It was another step away from the normal with bond really being an assassin but this time for his friend.Quantum of Solace: I was looking forward to reading this as I had always wondered about the title. This was a very different affair from any story I have read so far. Bond is in Nassau and attends a dinner party at Government House, after completing a mission. The story follows a conversation bond has with The Governor. The Quantum of Solace is the death of common humanity.Risico: M sends Bond to investigate a drug-smuggling operation based in Italy that is sending narcotics to England. This is an interesting tale but one that from watching movies I has already picked up the theme. The characters in this story however make the tale much more than the plot.The Hildebrand Rarity: While Bond is on an assignment in the Seychelles Islands he meets American millionaire Milton Krest, who Bond aid him in the search for a rare fish. This was a strange story, a big side step away with no real reasons for bond doing what he does. The focus I found was the inner monologue of bond and how he sees and feels about death.."}, {"userName": "Danny M", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5756910-danny-m", "userReview": "YES, I AM A FAN OF THE JAMES BOND BOOKS! MY MOTHER DURING THE 1960'S PURCHASED THE COMPLETE SET OF IAN FLEMINGS BOOKS, THE JAMES BOND SERIES, FROM A SIGN UP OFFERING OF A BOOK CLUB FOR $1.99. IN MY EARLY TEENS I READ EVERY BOOK AND IT STARTED ME AS AN AVID READER OF SPY AND SUSPENSE NOVELS. I HAVE PROBABLY READ THE COMPLETE SET ABOUT 6 TIMES FROM 1960 TO PRESENT. I AM GOING TO WRITE A GENERIC REVIEW OF THE JAMES BOND SERIES AS EVERYONE PROBABLY KNOWS THE STORYLINE FROM EITHER READING THE BOOKS OR WATCHING THE MOVIES. YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THE TIME FRAME WHEN THE BOOKS WERE WRITTEN AND PLACE YOURSELF IN THAT TIME PERIOD. THE BOOKS WERE REVOLUTIONARY IN THIER THEME. SOME OF THE GADGETS WERE VERY ADVANCED COMPARED TO WHAT WAS AVAILABLE AT THAT TIME. THE CREATOR OF JAMES BOND, IAN FLEMING, HAD A REPUTATION FOR BEING AN AUTHOR, WHO IN REAL LIFE WAS AS COLORFUL AS HIS CHARACTERS, AND HIS NOVELS MIMICKED THE AUTHOR'S PERSONALITY.THE BOOKS CONTAIN INCREDIBLE SUSPENSE, UNEXPECTED THRILLS, AND EXTRAORDINARY DANGER. THE NOVELS ARE CLASSIC IN THIER GENRE, AND ARE REQUIRED READING FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN SPY OR SUSPENSE NOVELS. THE BOOKS ARE FAST PACED AND ACTION DRIVEN IN THE GENRE OF ESPIONAGE. ONE NOVELS LEADS INTO THE NEXT, AND YOU SHOULD START WITH THE FIRST NOVREL AND FINISH WITH THE LAST IN THE SERIES. THE NOVELS ARE WRITTEN UNDER A CLOUD OF THE COLD WAR, WITH A NOSTALGIC VIEW OF THE GLORY DAYS OF THE BRITISH SECRET SERVICE. THE BOOKS ARE CLASSIC SPY THRILLERS IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD.THE BOOKS ARE EASY TO READ AND FOLLOW, AND WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT WAY TO START A YOUNG PERSON INTO THE ADDICTION OF READING FOR FUN.

If you have tried to read a Bond novel and found it not to your liking, I would suggest that you give these a go.From a View to a Kill: A British army motorcycle dispatch rider is murdered on his way to NATO headquarters. Unconvinced that this was not a serious breach of security and anxious to protect MI6\u2019s assets, M instructs Bond to investigate.For Your Eyes Only: Following the murder of a pair of British ex-pats in the Caribbean - who happen to have been friends of M - Bond is asked to ensure that the culprits are punished.Quantum of Solace: This is actually one of my favourite Bond stories purely for the novelty value. Bond finds himself the final guest following a dinner party held by the Governor of Jamaica. Although the two men have little in common, a glib remark by Bond leads the governor to recount an amusing anecdote about a cuckold husband and his adulterous wife.Risico: Bond is ordered to sever the pipeline of narcotics entering the country and a meeting is arranged with the CIA\u2019s contact. Following the meeting, Bond is given the name of the man behind the whole operation on the condition that the man is permanently removed from the equation. When Bond finally makes contact, things appear to be more complicated than he has been lead to believe.The Hildebrand Rarity: Bond is hired by an arrogant rich American to assist in hunting down a rare fish that the collector has promised the Smithsonian as part of a tax break.

It collects five stories all in different locations, but all with similar plots. For the most part I wasn't a fan of these stories. Not much happens in them and some are kind of boring. I only found the title short story interesting.The short story \"For Your Eyes Only\" is only one I liked in this collection. I didn't so much like the first part of the story, but I loved the fact that most of the story took place in Vermont. I live in Vermont, so reading one of my favorite action heroes kicking ass in my home state definitely made my night. Fleming seemed to write a more accurate version of the Vermont woods then most people too. Comes to find out he spent many summers in Vermont.\"Quantum of Solace\" kind of brought down this book. In my opinion it was a very boring story. Not sure how they made a movie of it because all it seemed to talk about was a married couple and how Bond couldn't get married. This was information that I thought we already knew and didn't need to read about again; it's obvious he can't be a married man a sleep with all these beautiful women.The other stories were a little better, but again they just didn't grab my attention. I baffled by the fact that they made some of these movies. They are all about 35 pages each and the movies are about two hours. Seems to me like they just used the titles and some names and changed the plot around.I wish I could give this a higher rating. If this was just the story \"For Your Eyes Only\" and with more about Vermont, then I'd be in love with this book. Yet there is only one story I really liked. If you want to read Bond this one isn't necessary, but I'm reading them all."}, {"userName": "GoldGato", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6401606-goldgato", "userReview": "JAMES BONDthe indestructible agent who thrives on trouble--both violent and voluptuous--pits his devastating wiles and deadly charm against the most bizarre fiends he's ever encountered in these high-voltage exploits taken direct from the files ofIAN FLEMINGmaster of murder, mystery, and incredible suspense.Aahh, you have to love the way the original Bond novels were marketed in the early 1960s...a time of Cold War served with martinis, timeless clothing, and British spies who could swing with the best.

Whilst many of the titles were used as titles for the films, the film plots have limited connections to the stories here. From a View to a Kill: A SHAPE agent is mysteriously killed so Bond goes to investigate. It's almost more of a murder mystery as Bond tries to work out who the assassin was and where he came from. It's a decent story with a superbly atmospheric opening sequence. For Your Eyes Only: Bond is sent on a more personal mission by M. M's friends are killed and Bond is sent to kill the murderers. Typically the victim's daughter is trying to do the same and Bond has to try and deal with her presence as he completes the mission. A different kind of story and it feels odd to see Bond as a simple assassin. Quantum of Solace: An odd one in that Bond is only used as the framing device- the story itself is told to Bond at a party. It's essentially tells the story of a socially-unequal relationship. Nothing about it feels like Bond and I would have preferred if Fleming had kept Bond out of it altogether. It's a homage to W Somerset Maugham which feels so weird in the Bond universe. Risico: Bond is sent to stop some drug smuggling and ends up working with Colombo, who is essentially partakes in serious organised crime (though not drugs). What works really well here is Bond working with someone who is not on his usual side (MI6/CIA etc) and the relationship between the two of them. The Hildebrand Rarity: Whilst working on an underwhelming job in the Seychelles Bond joins millionaire Milton Krest on a mission to catch a rare fish. It turns out that Krest is abusing his wife and Bond has to decide whether to intervene. Another different style of story and for me the best in the collection. What I really liked about this collection was that the stories were so different from normal Bond plots- none of these feature Bond investigating a possible villain and getting heavily involved in them. Even Risico which is closest to that format gives us a pleasing twist. My only criticism is that the addition of a Bond girl in every story felt unnecessary- it kind of works when there's a chance to build up a relationship in a novel but it just made Bond comes across as a serial womanizer even more than usual. A great collection with four superb stories and one which isn't really a Bond story at all."}], "description": "A departure from the full-length James Bond novels, For Your Eyes Only is a stunning collection of five stories that sends 007 to Bermuda, Berlin, and beyond, and places him in the dangerous company of adversaries of all varieties.
