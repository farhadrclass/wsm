Now Jessie must sort through a long list of knaves, knights, and wenches who might have wanted to see the chocolatier double-dipped and dead.REVIEW: A great, easy-to-read cozy mystery that takes place in the midst of a Renaissance Faire Village in South Carolina. Loved the setting, great plot, and enough twists and turns to keep the reader interested. Jessie is a great, main character and her sleuthing gets her into just enough scrapes and problems from which she has to extricate herself (often with the help of her boyfriend, the bailiff) to keep you wondering what will happen next. I look forward to reading more of these Renaissance Faire mysteries. FAVORITE QUOTES:'You never know when you are going to say exactly the right thing.

The Characters are well developed and they still continue to be pointed out in a great fashion. The mystery of this book is fine, in fact it had me going around in circles for a time. I was a bit disappointed in Jessie's apprenticeship though. She was to be working for the hat maker and most of the time she was either late or talking movies with the hat maker who used to work in Hollywood. Little was talked about the craft of making hats, or how important hats were to the Renaissance period. If this was something she was supposed to be working into her dissertation, meh. I learned very little and personally I prefer to learn something from this type of book, be it a cozy mystery or not."}, {"userName": "Vera", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/356181-vera", "userReview": "More adventures at the Renaissance Fair! This time Jessie ends up working in the hat shop, but as always murder disturbs the village. Fun series, and good mystery, which was more true to life than some stories of crazed serial killers stalking the land.

And by now you think everyone would reject her just because whomever she is apprenticing usually ends up a suspect in a murder. There is also a new group of Templars at the Faire causing conflict with the regulars. Unfortunately when one of the Three Chocolatiers is murdered, Jessie's boss, Andre is suspect and she is determined to help clear him.I still enjoy the characters and the setting as both continue to grow with the books."}, {"userName": "LORI CASWELL", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4770012-lori-caswell", "userReview": "This series features Jessie Morton, an assistant history professor at the University of South Carolina at Columbia. Each summer she returns to Renaissance Faire Village to work as an apprentice for her dissertation - \"The Proliferation of Medieval Crafts in Modern Times\".This summer she is working with Andre Hariot at Harriet's Hat House. Andre used to work in Hollywood making hats for many famous movies but something drove him away and he ended up at the Renaissance Faire Village.Living at the faire is quite a treat for Jessie until one of the Three Chocolatiers is found drowned in a vat of chocolate with a hat pin in his eye. Maybe this summer's apprenticeship with be curtailed if her boss is found guilty of the murder. But he is just one of several suspects, turns out the sweet treat maker had quite a few enemies. Jessie feels obligated to do little investigating on her own to find out who really killed the chocolate candy man and save her sweet hat maker in the process.I find myself looking forward to my adventures with Jessie and all the knaves, knights, wrenches and fools as we travel to the Renaissance Faire. This year it's even more exciting as a whole new group has been added to the Village and the residents are not happy which adds yet another element for humor and strife.I have liked all the books in this series but this is the first one I can say I loved because the mystery was much more complex, the characters have gained depth and are more real. That is what happens with series books, the author becomes more comfortable with the characters and they evolve naturally and effortlessly for the reader. There were also a couple of surprises and teasers that leaves the reader waiting for the next installment. This is definitely a series to read in order to appreciate the entire series and the reader will see how each one just keeps getting better and better.

The vivid setting details take you into daily life as a worker/actor at a Renaissance Faire. The varied, memorable characters were engaging. Jessie and her boyfriend dealt with realistic relationship uncertainties and problems, especially considering the general bed-hopping behavior of the other characters and in their own past.Suspense was created by physical danger to Jessie and by wondering how her relationship troubles with her boyfriend (the Bailiff) were going to work out. One of the mysteries could be solved through clues before the \"reveal.\" Jessie solved the main mystery as quickly as the clues were uncovered, and it was a well-developed mystery.My only problem was with the \"prank\" done near the end. I've been to several Renaissance Faires and had friends who worked at them. I've never seen a sharpened sword allowed on a worker/demonstrator. It's not something I think could have gone unnoticed in those circumstances, either. It makes for a great scene, but it's not realistic. Not to mention that knowledge of how to use a sword doesn't make a heavy sword any lighter for a woman to use.There was a minor amount of explicit bad language. (Unmarried) sex was implied and was mentioned in a \"she's sleeping with him\" fashion, but there were no sex scenes. Overall, I'd recommend this enjoyable, engaging mystery.I received this book as a review copy from the publisher."}, {"userName": "Susan Ferguson", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5666895-susan-ferguson", "userReview": "As always, I enjoy the books in this series. Jessie is at the Renaissance Faire again. She is apprenticed to Andre Hariot, the hatmaker who used to work in movies making hats for the stars. Most of his hats are custom-made to order and he makes all the hats for the different workers at the Faire. He also designs an individual hatpin for each customer. An idiosyncrasy that comes in handy in solving the murder of the bossy head chocolatier of the Three Chocolateers.Jessie has no apprenticeship set up and is stuck at the frog-throwing booth at the Renaissance Fair. Which is not one of her finer moments. Chase comes through though and gets her an apprenticeship with Andre Hariot who is despairing of those apprentices that he has. The name of the shop is Harriet's Hats due to a misunderstanding of the signmaker, but no one as bothered to change it. Andre is a fount of miscellaneous information about the movies. Jessie enjoys their conversations about the movies. She also gets a closer look at some of the intrigues and romances going on, which lead to jealous displays and fights. Which ends up in murder of the head chocolatier in his own chocolate vat - with a hatpin through his eye."}, {"userName": "Pam", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2607874-pam", "userReview": "I didn't realize this was part of a series until I'd already started it. Fortunately for me, the way the story is laid out it didn't really matter. The premise/setting is unusual and the setting vividly described, with lots of colorful inhabitants of the Renaissance Village. The characters that play a more prominent role are pretty well rounded and the plot flow is smooth, with a good integration of fun, mixed in with Jessie's sleuthing. Chase is a typical hero and a nice guy...but he most definitely plays second fiddle to Jessie and the way she goes about looking for the killer.I really enjoyed Andre...the hat maker and prime murder suspect. His personality was the most rounded of the secondaries and I loved how the author threw in pieces of Hollywood movie/costume history. Adding in the Knights Templar was a nice touch and helped to keep things lively and most full of action. There were a few twists and turns but the killer wasn't exactly a big surprise in the end. It'll be interesting to see what kind of trouble Jessie and her friends can get into next."}, {"userName": "Grey853", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/202173-grey853", "userReview": "Jessie is spending the summer in the Renaissance Faire Village as an apprentice hat maker. She's still involved with Chance, but they're also still bickering. Apparently Chance is keeping a big secret. The main plot of the novel is that a chocolate maker is killed by chocolate and a hat pin is found on the body. Jessie's hat maker master is a suspect in the murder.This is a fluffy series in that it's hard to take much seriously when everyone is running around in costumes and pretending to live in another age.It would also be a better series if the Jessie and Chance scenes weren't constant fighting and making up. I found that to be very tiresome.It's a quick and easy read with some humor. Even though it's the 4th in the series, one doesn't have to read the others to enjoy the book."}, {"userName": "Vickie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/253719-vickie", "userReview": "I liked this book well enough and I will try another of the series, but I like the authors' other series better, especially The Missing Pieces Mystery series. I'm not sure if it's the setting of an entire Renaissance village or the cutesy names of each shop and eatery that irritated me. Or it might have been the insecurity of the main character, Jessie, with her boyfriend, the Village Bailiff, Chase Manhattan...(really)....apparently every woman just waits for Jessie to no longer hold interest for Chase and he will move on to one of the comely lasses in the village. She wavers between being just fine with the relationship and following him everywhere he goes. The mystery was okay, enough to keep me reading to see if I was right on the whodunit (I wasn't). I think I will locate the first in the series, WICKED WEAVES, and see if this helps my enjoyment."}, {"userName": "Dharia Scarab", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11756730-dharia-scarab", "userReview": "Since I don't normally write reviews unless I have something specific to say, here's the break down of how I rate my books...1 star...

The author(s) have finally let the Renaissance Village characters be themselves instead of, well, Renaissance village \"characters.\" Personally, I'd love to see what Jessie looks like because apparently the men just can't seem to stop hitting on her. And honestly, this gets to be a bit much. I get it that she is brave, and nosy, and relatively friendly to everyone, but she comes across as a kind of Renaissance Cindy Crawford. Regardless, this time the subplot with the Knights of the Templar was interesting when added to the murder mystery plot. Altogether, not a bad read, and an easy cozy mystery via which to escape real life."}, {"userName": "Valerie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2553516-valerie", "userReview": "There are times I wish that Goodreads allowed 1/2 stars. This is one of those times because really I'm between liking this one and really liking it. There are elements of the story that I really enjoy and yet the mystery itself wasn't that exciting for me. It got to the point that by the time we found out who killed the chocolatier, I just didn't care. But there were other parts of the story that I thoroughly enjoyed, such as Jessie & Chase's relationship and the way it grows through this storyline. In the end, I decided on 4 stars because it's better than just 3 stars, but really I feel it's about a 3.5."}, {"userName": "Gretchen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4460374-gretchen", "userReview": "This is the fourth book in this series.

How can such characters and situations not be fun and clever? The answer is that they most certainly give this book a unique and creative background for the action. However, the only thing good about the book \"is\" the background. The rest is just boring silliness. Think of this book as an \"I Love Lucy\" episode in an alternate universe (where \"I Love Lucy\" stinks).
