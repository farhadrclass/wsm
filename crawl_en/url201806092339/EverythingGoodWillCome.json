Since I was cooped up with her it\u2019s a good thing I liked Enitan; her high spirits, sharp tongue, feminist discontent and friendliness towards other women like Sheri, whom her family and husband dislike, made her a firm friend from early in the telling. The friendship between the two women is the most attractive thing about the narrative to me and Sheri's sparkiness provides some needed leaven. Both of them have to negotiate a position in a culture that has limiting and exacting expectations of women and they meet the sexism they experience in totally different styles. It was good to see stubborn Enitan admitting she had learned from Sheri, and confident Sheri taking advice from Enitan when she needed it. Such subtle details give the story emotional richness, and the strong focus on relationships integrates with flavourful descriptions of everyday life and political commentary. Atta's direct, unornamented but sure-footed and witty style binds everything together to give the impression of real autobiography, told chronologically and without foreshadowing. Enitan's changing priorities move the narrative forward, rather than a storytelling voice shaping and smoothing. Instead of leading to a central crisis, the story is set in a zone of unrelenting tension, where the emergence of Enitan's political consciousness roots in the reader a deepening sense of Nigeria's problems. Atta doesn't explain, rather the text embodies the losses and conflicts of community and tradition in the age of extractivism; for example Enitan discovers in her relationship with an artist her limited knowledge of her Yoruba heritage, and remembers her mother's flamboyant style of dress before she became absorbed in the church, and it's possible to read the creeping cultural homogenisation of global neoliberalism in the language and desires of the characters, for example the way economic problems are blamed on Muslim 'Northerners'. However, the focus on personal happiness and self-determination rang my social justice bells pleasantly. This is an easy read with far-from-easy themes."}, {"userName": "\u0633\u0644\u0645\u0649 Selma Mohaimeed ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12212574-selma-mohaimeed", "userReview": "\u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u064a\u062c\u064a\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0627\u0642\u0631\u0624\u0647\u0627 \u060c \u0648\u0644\u0645 \u064a\u062a\u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0634\u064a\u0621 \u0639\u0646 \u0645\u0627 \u0643\u0646\u062a \u0623\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0647 \u0641\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0633 \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0642\u0637\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0642\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u062f\u0639 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u063a\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0627\u062d\u0634 \u0648 \u0644\u0627\u0623\u062d\u062f \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u062a\u0635\u0641 ! \u064a\u063a\u0645\u0631\u0647\u0645 \u0641\u0633\u0627\u062f\u064c \u0643\u0628\u064a\u0631 \u060c\u0643\u0628\u064a\u0631 \u060c \u0643\u064a\u0641\u0645\u0627 \u062a\u062a\u062e\u064a\u0644\u0647 \u0641\u0647\u0648 \u0623\u0643\u0628\u0631 \u060c\u0633\u0628\u0628\u0647 \u0641\u064a \u0631\u0623\u064a\u064a \u0645\u0633\u0644\u0633\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0642\u0644\u0627\u0628\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u062a\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u062a\u062e\u0631\u062c \u0645\u0646\u0647 \u0646\u064a\u062c\u064a\u0631\u0646\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0643\u0644 \u0645\u0631\u0629 \u0628\u0639\u0645\u0644\u0629 \u0623\u0636\u0639\u0641 \u0648 \u0623\u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0642\u0644 \u0648\u0628\u062f\u0648\u0646 \u0623\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u0648\u0627\u0631\u062f \u061b \u0648 \u0644\u0644\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0621 \u0637\u0628\u0639\u064b\u0627 \u0646\u0635\u064a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u062f \u0645\u0646 \u062a\u0628\u0639\u0627\u062a \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0633\u0627\u062f \u0648\u063a\u0646\u0627\u0626\u0645\u0647 . \"\u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0641\u0636\u0644 \u0622\u062a\" \u062a\u062d\u0627\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0627\u062a\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u064a\u062c\u064a\u0631\u064a\u0629/\u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a\u0629 \u0633\u064a\u0641\u064a \u0623\u062a\u0627 \u0625\u0642\u0646\u0627\u0639\u0643 \u0628\u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0648\u0628\u0627\u0644\u0631\u063a\u0645 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0636\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0632\u0631\u064a \u0623\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0647 \u0641\u0625\u0646 \u0628\u0637\u0644\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u062a\u0633\u062a\u0637\u064a\u0639 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0632\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0645\u0633\u0642\u0628\u0644\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0642\u0644\u0629\u064b \u060c \u0633\u0639\u064a\u062f\u0629\u060c \u0647\u0646\u064a\u0629!!! \u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u0639\u0633\u064a\u0631 . \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0637\u0648\u064a\u0644\u0629 \u0646\u0633\u0628\u064a\u064b\u0627 \u0648\u0645\u0645\u0644\u0629 \u0628\u0639\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0651\u064a\u0621 . \u0632\u062f \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u0637\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0628\u0639\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631\u0629 ."}, {"userName": "Emma Deplores Goodreads Censorship", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship", "userReview": "This is an interesting and colorful, but also disjointed and rushed, story of a young woman growing up in Lagos, Nigeria. It begins in 1971, when she\u2019s 11, and ends when she\u2019s 35. Unlike a lot of African literature, this book seems aimed more at insiders than outsiders (unsurprising since it specifically discusses this issue), with the result that the story and setting seem complex and authentic, although some of the dialogue was confusing to me as an American reader.There isn\u2019t really a plot here, unless \u201clife happens\u201d is a plot. When we first meet our narrator, Enitan, she is an only child in a well-off but unhappy household, and finds her new best friend in the next-door neighbor of whom her parents disapprove. Then Enitan goes off to boarding school; when she returns home for vacation, she witnesses something terrible happen to her friend. Then she goes to London to complete her education, becomes a lawyer and works there for awhile. Then she tires of England, returns to Lagos, and clashes with her father. Then she has a relationship with an artsy guy, but breaks it off when he cheats on her. Then\u2026. well, you get the picture. There is nothing tying all these scenarios together, except that they involve the same character and that the challenge of being a modern woman in Nigeria is a prominent theme.Despite all that, this isn\u2019t a bad book. Atta can write. Her characters and settings are interesting, her ideas well-expressed and her scenes vivid. This book contains the seeds of at least three excellent novels; I wish the author had chosen and nurtured one of them rather than stuffing seemingly everything she wanted to write all into one book. Many of the scenes and situations in the book are fresh and painfully real, giving glimpses of what a great book this could be if the author focused in and fully developed a few of them.Many readers have apparently disliked Enitan. Perhaps because she\u2019s a modern-minded woman who pushes against her society\u2019s expectations, but I suspect the real culprit is that lack of development. For instance, Enitan\u2019s husband has traditional ideas about gender roles, expecting her to serve his friends drinks and not stepping in to help even when she\u2019s grieving. And she is a well-educated urban professional with a strong sense of herself and her opinions. When no reason is shown for her obviously poor choice in marriage \u2013 she chooses this guy seemingly at random, without his first displaying any positive qualities \u2013 it\u2019s easy for readers to become annoyed with Enitan\u2019s subsequent frustration. How can we fully sympathize with her dissatisfaction when she puts herself in these situations and we don't understand why?[Note: I have read no fewer than three books in the last few months with this same problem, the inexplicable marriage of our heroine to a guy with no redeeming qualities, who of course turns out to be a turd. All 20th century settings, all employed heroines with college degrees and a reasonable sense of self-esteem. Authors, I know you want to make clear who we're meant to root for, but healthy people don't just marry whoever looks their way.]In the end, then, this book shows talent but not quite enough discipline; it has some strong plot moments and characters, but its plotting is disjointed - as, sometimes, is its writing, jumping from one idea to another without transition. I'm open to reading another book from this author, but I'd want to see some strong reviews first."}, {"userName": "Mphokolo", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8547028-mphokolo", "userReview": "Definitely a must read.

An incredibly compelling story held together by a not-altogether likeable narrator (which, strangely enough, tends to be my favourite kind - I enjoy a anti-hero(ine) which she isn't exactly, but I still found I felt somewhat ambivalently towards her), the novel tells the life story of Enitan, a Nigerian woman, from childhood through adolescence, early adulthood and marriage. At the same time,it sketches a picture of modern Nigeria from the time of the civil war up until the Abacha era. Underpinning the narrative are her many relationships, especially those with women (her best friend Sheri, her mother, a journalist called Grace Ameh). This is the first of Atta's books I've read, but I have been interested in her work for a while having read some of her views on WOC feminism. I appreciated observing how Enitan's views on her place as a woman in Nigerian society and her understanding of man-woman relationships evolved over time, even though sometimes her bluster was somewhat grating at times. Of all the characters, Sheri was my favourite - perhaps because in some strange way she embodies for me the archetypal Nigerian woman (able to rise above her past to make something powerful and meaningful of her life, even if it lies within the narrow confines of Nigerian society). I will definitely re-visit this book in the future."}, {"userName": "liz", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67550-liz", "userReview": "Fantastic Nigerian novel!!!

I saw that in the past I'd been inclined to want to break rocks, stamping my feet and throwing tantrums when I couldn't. Acting without grace.

It was entirely another to face an African dictatorship and tell them how to treat people like citizens.Reading this so soon after devouring Elena Ferrante's first three Neapolitan novels, I was struck by the overlap of interests of these books: a memoir-esque account of a girlhood friendship between two clever girls that remains a lifelong touchstone as they grow up to struggle against patriarchy, against oppression. The political situations of the books are different, though both cover many brutal events, and Atta's novel left me feeling a lot more optimistic and emotionally satisfied. There is less emotional ambiguity in its ending. (And I loved the ending! Atta nails the last part of the book beautifully. The book earns its title, not with the amount of awfulness and heartbreak it--and protagonist Enitan--endures, but because it insists that all those pieces matter.)The official book description focuses on childhood, but that part of the book is very brief. What's being traced throughout the book is Enitan's development as a woman, person, citizen. She's never not been capable of argument and self-assertion, but especially to start with, a lot of it is rooted in her sheltered childhood and in her privilege. But the personal is political, and the political is personal, and Atta takes care to show how Enitan's beliefs and analysis are rooted in her experiences and in her interactions with other women. One of my favorite passages is when Enitan is struck with the idea that she could in fact be correctly labeled a feminist--not just because she's an outspoken woman--and thinks about the frustrating categorization of women: By the time they came of age, millions of personalities were channeled into about three prototypes: strong and silent, chatterbox but cheerful, weak and kind-hearted. All the rest were known as horrible women. I wanted to tell everyone, \"I! Am! Not! Satisfied with these options!\" I was ready to tear every notion they had about women, like one of those little dogs with trousers in their teeth. They would not let go until there was nothing but shreds, and I would not let go until I was heard. Sometimes it felt like I was fighting annihilation. But surely it was in the interest of self-preservation to fight what felt like annihilation? If a person swiped a fly and the fly flew higher, would the fly become a flyist?I can see the flaws of Everything Good Will Come, and I can predict all the ways other readers might find it unappealing (I'm sure the feminism in this book is considered too didactic by readers, the time-skipping structure doesn't seem to lift the narrative well, the book didn't always smoothly integrate its exposition, and I was alternately in love with or frustrated by the prose--but my favorite line was, \"My mother was hollow, I thought. There was nothing in her. Like a drum, she could seize my heartbeat, but that was all.\"). I still really liked this book, though.I sighed. \"I want to be something like\u2026like president.\"\"Eh? Women are not presidents.\"\"Why not?\"\"Our men won't stand for it. Who will cook for your husband?\"\"He will cook for himself.\"\"What if he refuses?\"\"I'll drive him away.\"\"You can't,\" she said.\"Yes I can.

Enitan comes from an upper middle class dysfunctional family where the mum is obsessively religious and the dad is a somewhat successful lawyer.

I would like to say that this is a book about friendships that stand the test of time and the challenges of being a woman in an oppressive society and country.

I wanted to go back and pick over everything slowly, paying more attention to each detail, thinking about each situation, analysing each character.I am planning to move to Lagos, where Sefi Atta\u2018s Everything Good Will Come is set. Sure, the book opens in 1971, one year after the end of the Biafran war, and ends in 1995. A lot has changed, since then. Or has it? In any case, I don\u2019t think people change much. Skyscrapers may rise and roads may be built, but the old attitudes remain, by and large unexamined and unchallenged. This may sound pessimistic of me, but let\u2019s just say that I don\u2019t want to expect too much. I tell myself I should be prepared for sexism, corruption and hypocrisy. It\u2019s very much present in the world anyway, and from what I have heard and read, rife in Nigeria. I should remember that Don (my fiance) is an exception, and not the rule.Anyway, back to the book. I read Atta\u2019s A Bit of Difference a couple of years ago and, since then, have wanted to try her other stories. Unfortunately, never having won a \u2018major\u2019 award (i.e. one that is based in the West), Atta\u2019s books are not easy to find in Malaysian bookstores. (Sad to say, even Kinokuniya, or at least certain Kinokuniya buyers, is guided by endorsements by British and American lit awards\u2019 committees.) I found Difference in a remainders store (BookXcess) and ordered Good from ABEBooks.Everything Good Will Come is partly a coming-of-age novel. Its protagonist is Enitan who is eleven at the start of the book. At this point, living with her warring parents in Lagos, she becomes friends with her new nextdoor neighbour, a Muslim half-caste called Sheri.The backcover blurb gives the impression that the novel is about the two girls, but Enitan is the focus. It\u2019s her life, her struggles \u2013 with her parents, at school and university, as a working adult, and in her romantic relationships \u2013 that are portrayed in detail. And it\u2019s from her point of view that the story is told. Sheri drifts in and out of Enitan\u2019s life, serving as a contrast in personality and circumstances. She is an interesting, complex and contradictory character. On one hand, she panders to society\u2019s expectations of women, but on the other, she plays the system to her advantage.Enitan and Sheri lose touch in adolescence. Enitan goes to boarding school and university in England, and Sheri becomes Miss Nigeria. When they reconnect in adulthood, Enitan, now a lawyer, is doing her National Service and Sheri is mistress to a married man. She appears to be totally submissive, but a development in the plot reveals hidden depths.I like Sheri whose way of thinking I don\u2019t agree with, but whose reasons for acting the way she does, I can understand. She is practical and kind, but also ruthless when she has to be. I find her a more natural and believable character than Enitan whose idealism and actions seem somewhat contrived. It\u2019s like Atta decided to use this book and Enitan to make several points. Enitan sometimes talks like she\u2019s making a speech, and the narrative too often breaks into clumsy and heavy-handed social and political commentary. Still, I enjoyed reading it all and took it as a way of educating myself about Nigeria\u2019s history that was more entertaining than reading a wiki entry, academic text or history book.A few reviewers on Goodreads mention how unlikeable Enitan is. I didn\u2019t warm to her immediately, but I admired her awkwardness; her uncertainty; her prickly, contrary nature. I felt she was brave. I liked the way she stood up to her parents and the way she could admit to her mistakes and backtrack on wrong decisions. I liked the way she could feel love and yet be disgusted by some things about her lovers. Sure, she often seems like Atta\u2019s mouthpiece, but otherwise, her flaws make her real. When she\u2019s not being used to hammer home the author\u2019s opinions, Enitan feels as equally lovable and annoying as my dearest friends.I\u2019m not entirely sure about the ending though. Enitan makes two decisions and I understand and applaud one, but am still in two minds about the other. But then again, I realise, as I type this review, that the reason for my doubts isn\u2019t a very good one. It\u2019s based on the personal history of one of the characters, and the empathy I feel as a result of what I know. Aren\u2019t Enitan\u2019s actions heartless? How will her husband cope, considering what he has gone through before? I realise my reaction reflects the sort of person I am and reminds me of the bad decisions I\u2019ve made because of this anxiety I feel about being inconsiderate. It amazes me that my response to Enitan\u2019s decision should reveal something about me to myself. It makes me love this book even more.Finally, I must include this passage, in which Enitan talks about what Africa is to her, as opposed to how it is portrayed in books written by white writers:\u2026 books that described a colonial Africa so exotic I would want to be there myself, in a safari suit, served by some silent and dignified Kikuyu, or some other silent and dignified tribesman. Or a dark dark Africa, with snakes and vines and ooga-booga dialects. My Africa was a light one, not a dark one: there was so much sun. And Africa was an onslaught of sensations, as I once tried to explain to a group of English work mates, like eating an orange. What single sensation could you take from an orange? Stringy, mushy, tangy, bitter, sweet. The pup, seeds, segments, skin. The sting in your eyes. The long lasting smell on your fingers.\u2019Life is not all positive or all negative; all painful or all pleasurable. Life is everything, and everything is everything. The good will come, so will the bad. But to remember that \u2018everything good will come\u2019 (eventually?) is a good thing. The title is like a prayer, a mantra. It\u2019s significant to me right now, and gives me hope."}, {"userName": "Virginie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53578869-virginie", "userReview": "J'\u00e9tais tr\u00e8s charm\u00e9 au d\u00e9but, puis j'ai trouv\u00e9 que \u00e7a s'\u00e9tirait un peu vers le 2/3-3/4, pour reprendre int\u00e9r\u00eat plus pr\u00e8s de la toute fin.

It moves through the chronology of the main character, Enitan's, life as a young woman growing up in Lagos, Nigeria. Sometimes large chunks of time are skipped over, and at other times, detailed moments are delved into. Maybe it's not as crafted as it could have been, but I liked it for not forcing itself to be pretty and appealing, for being slightly sloppy and untidy. It's the kind of narrative that a woman might share over many cups of tea with an old friend that she's summarizing her life to, explaining how she landed where she is now.Enitan's story comments on sexism, chauvinism, patriarchy, marriage, modern vs. traditional, old money vs. new money, and the development of a social activist consciousness. There were some times where I felt like Atta really got it right in how she expressed certain experiences and ideas. For example, on the mundane challenges of marriage:\"I would eventually grow used to this and other marital surprises. I didn't know a man could have his own way of squeezing toothpaste. I didn't know I could come close to lunging across the dining table to throttle a man, because of the way he chewed.\" (p. 182)On the expectations of what it means to be a woman:\"I'd seen the metamorphosis of women, how age slowed their walks, stilled their expressions, softened their voices, distorted what came out of their mouths. They hid their discontent so that other women wouldn't deprive them of it. By the time they came of age, millions of personalities were channeled into about three prototypes: strong and silent, chatterbox but cheerful, weak and kindhearted. All the rest were known as horrible women. I wanted to tell everyone, 'I! Am! Not! Satisfied with these options!'\" (p. 200)On the perceptions of Africa by non-Africans and the portrayal of Africa in literature:\"... books that described a colonial Africa so exotic I would want to be there myself, in a safari suit, served by some silent and dignified Kikuyu, or some other silent and dignified tribesman. Or a dark dark Africa, with snakes and vines and ooga-booga dialects. My Africa was a light one, not a dark one: there was so much sun. And Africa was an onslaught of sensations, as I once tried to explain to a group of English work mates, like eating an orange. What single sensation could you take from an orange? Stringy, mushy, tangy, bitter, sweet. The pup, seeds, segments, skin. The sting in your eyes. The long lasting smell on your fingers.\" (p. 261)I enjoyed reading about Enitan's life and her thoughts and how she made sense of what she experienced around her, especially when what was going on around her didn't make much sense at all. Enitan's voice is a critical and wise one. I look forward to reading Atta's later novels."}, {"userName": "Anastasia", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/412789-anastasia", "userReview": "Although this passage is not representative of the novel or what it's about, it was one of my favorite parts:From Everything Good Will Come, pgs. 260-261\u201cAnd African authors, it seemed, were always having to explain the smallest things to the res of the world. To an African reader, these things could appear over-explained. Harmattan for instance. You already knew: a season, December-January, dust in the eyes, coughing, chilly mornings, by afternoon sweaty armpits. Whenever I read foreign books, they never explained the simplest things, like snow. How it crunched under your shoes, kissed your face both warm and cold. How you were driven to trample it, then loathed it after it became soiled. All these things! No one ever bothered to tell and African! This never occurred to me, until an English friend once commented on how my accent changed whenever I spoke to my Nigerian friends. That was my natural accent, I told her. If I spoke to her that way, she would never understand. She looked stunned. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d she said sincerely. \u201cThat is so polite.\u201dAfter I\u2019d come to terms with how polite I was being, I became incensed at a world that was impolite to me. Underexplained books, books that described a colonial African so exotic I would want to be there myself, in a safari suit, served by some silent and dignified Kikuyu, or some other silent and dignified tribesman.

And for the better informed: \u201cHow about that Idi Amin Dada fellow, eh?\u201d That Mobutu Sese Seko fellow, that Jean-Bedel Bokasso fellow, as though those of us who just happened to be living in the same continent could vouch for the sanity of any of these fellows.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Ebehi", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2028906-ebehi", "userReview": "I was told this was a critically acclaimed Nigerian book so patriot that I am, I decided to give it a try. By the time I was halfway through I did not see any reason to finish it other than the fact that I had already started. I will not pick it up again except for a class, and even then I will be reluctant to do so.It started out interesting enough. I liked the childhood story and found Enitan's friend, Sheri very complex and fascinating. Enitan was only interesting because of the role she played in the dynamics of the relationship. I think the problem was that the only time that Enitan's life seemed worth reading about was when she was with Sheri. After we lost touch with Sheri,the story lost me.Atta uses a memoir-like style as she narrates events in Enitan's life but there were very few times that I felt like I should care. Enitan just tells us her lifestory but I don't really see a plot. And even though we're stuck in her head, I think she is the dullest character in the book. Sheri, and Enitan's parents all have more depth and it get's annoying when she keeps telling us things that happen in such a boring way. I really don't care about her.I started reading this book and then couldn't get through it. I tried to read it again a year later but it wasn't any more engaging. There are very few memorable scenes in this book and I wish Atta had tried to entertain more than inform.

I like how Enitan writes about her life...basically like a synopsis of her life.It is amazing how she drops gems inside this book about the thought process of when a woman loves a man or is it when a man loves a woman? All the politics in the book coupled with steamy food stuff and all the different cultural backgrounds she had to interact with. Makes for a really good read.I like it that she shows her imperfections and admits that having a family is tough work. How the topic of being barren was tackled deserves a hat tip. For women, the older you become, the harder you have to try..the key thing is not to give up.Governments known for extrajudicial killings are scattered all over this continent of Africa. A shame the law does not recognize people\u2019s rights even with the advent of reticent constitutions. You mention rights...they tell you respect your elders....or easily get labelled an activist.The family structure was really put to test here... with Enitan coming from a dysfunctional home and being forced to choose sides. That is such a hard choice... When she finds out she even has a brother...it is difficult to know when the rain started beating. Men are portrayed as harbouring secrets.https://storify.com/samdemic/everythi..."}, {"userName": "Anny", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14607265-anny", "userReview": "Honestly, this book disappointed me. It started off really good, the way she described Enitan's childhood and how she introduced each character. Sheri, Niyi, Sunny and a few other characters were well thought out. But from the part where Enitan was married had me trying to connect the young Enitan and the older Enitan and it just didn't fit. The jump of 10 years destroyed any chance of me understanding why Enitan turned out the way she did. I will describe the older Enitan as childish, confused, self-centered, indecisive and antagonistic. I did not like her at all. The only reason I kept on reading the book was because I thought that she would finally grow up but it turns out that she didn't. She thought only of herself, how situations affect her and expected that whatever decisions or choices she made should be accepted by her loved ones, all as a way of \"supporting\" her. In my opinion, the author left us hanging at the end. It was not the kind of ending that makes you wonder what happened to the characters after but the kind that made you feel like you wasted your time."}, {"userName": "Chinelo", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19943798-chinelo", "userReview": "How to be an independent woman ; easy you just have to be independent. Let go of everything holding you back and stop trying to fit in, doing what tradition expects you to, because often times those expectations are there to make it easier for men to oppress women. Growing up, Enitan watched her friend get raped and always blamed her friend for being too open but gradually, in this books that stretches from pre to post military regime Nigeria, she sees the problems with her society and would become a hero for bold and young feminist women. This book made me love Nigeria, my country, with all its potholes and superstitious traditions. It also made me laugh , with Nigerian expressions that we are only too fond of and some even harder after a brief second of wonder. In the end, the characters win their fight not only against the brutal dictatorship in Nigeria but also against society.

While she walks against the injustice of being a woman in Lagos, for most of the book she remains like a sulky, impetuous teen. Despite being surrounded by other strong women, she can't reconcile herself to the ways they seem to appease men. None of them can be her role models, so she must find her own muddled way toward something that gives strength, not just to herself, but to other women as well. The tale is slightly uneven, sometimes rushing too hastily over stretches of time, sketching biographical details - telling not showing - without really building a sense of character. In spite of this uneveness, Atta unfolds a believable tale, with believable characters, with a great sense of place in Lagos."}, {"userName": "Carolee Weber", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4383497-carolee-weber", "userReview": "Good book, but not great. Uneven writing -- some great patches here and there, but a lot of very average prose. It was interesting to me because I'm living in Lagos, so much is familiar, but I don't know if someone unfamiliar with Nigeria would find it very compelling. The plot (if there is one) is rambling -- it's supposedly about the relationship between the main character (who I never really liked that much) and her wild friend, but much of the book doesn't focus on that at all. Some of it just seemed to be written to express frustration with the difficulties of dysfunctional and difficult Nigerian life and societal norms and destructive Nigerian government.

This book bridged together the issues we'd been discussing in the course including ethnicity, class, economics, politics, and rape culture. It focused on one woman living in Nigeria and featured her friend who belonged to a different ethnic group and had a different experience of living as a woman in their part of Nigeria. It covered the time from the Biafran civil war up to more modern times. This book was filled with great quotes and imagery. My only criticism of this book is that it glossed over certain parts, and the transition was jarring at times. However, this structure does simulate the narrator's experience."}], "description": "Everything Good Will Come introduces an important new voice in contemporary fiction. It is 1971, a year after the Biafran War, and Nigeria is under military rule\u2014though the politics of the state matter less than those of her home to Enitan Taiwo, an eleven-year-old girl tired of waiting for school to start. Will her mother, who has become deeply religious since the death of Taiwo's brother, allow her friendship with the new girl next door, the brash and beautiful Sheri Bakare? Everything Good Will Come charts the fate of these two African girls, one born of privilege and the other, a lower class \"half-caste\"; one who is prepared to manipulate the traditional system while the other attempts to defy it.Written in the voice of Enitan, the novel traces this unusual friendship into their adult lives, against the backdrop of tragedy, family strife, and a war-torn Nigeria. In the end, Everything Good Will Come is Enitan's story; one of a fiercely intelligent, strong young woman coming of age in a culture that still insists on feminine submission. Enitan bucks the familial and political systems until she is confronted with the one desire too precious to forfeit in the name of personal freedom: her desire for a child. Everything Good Will Come evokes the sights and smells of Africa while imparting a wise and universal story of love, friendship, prejudice, survival, politics, and the cost of divided loyalties.", "title": "Everything Good Will Come", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/227730.Everything_Good_Will_Come", "average": 3.82, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1172880170l/227730.jpg", "reviews": 79, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/133292.Sefi_Atta", "name": "Sefi Atta"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Cultural", "Western Africa", "Historical", "Literature"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/227730.Everything_Good_Will_Come", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38466754", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2198950.Everything_Good_Will_Come", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12194441-le-meilleur-reste-venir", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20429294-everything-good-will-come", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15830495-a-bit-of-difference", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8255951-swallow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8025746-news-from-home", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8228054-lawless-other-stories", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12844822-it-s-my-turn"]}
