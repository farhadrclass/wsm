Laura is a divorced and broken woman for whom intimacy has proved to be a disappointment. She finds employment as housekeeper and assistant to writer Anthony Peardew, who experienced heartbreak with the loss of his beloved Therese on his wedding day. That event has coloured and haunted his entire life, with guilt over a broken promise, a lost communion medal, and led to the enormous collection of lost items which he has found with the hope of reuniting them with their owners. He dies, leaving his home, Padua, to Laura for whom it is a sanctuary, with a condition that she makes efforts to restore the lost items to their true owners. Whilst owning Padua brings security and delight to Laura, the real prize turns out to be the task Anthony sets for it offers Laura a path toward resurrecting her life again, tenuously learning to trust people and connect with the world again. With faltering steps, Laura befriends the extraordinary girl that is Sunshine, a downs syndrome child who has been bullied. Sunshine is special and has the capacity to see and understand things that elude Laura, particularly when it comes to a irascible and troubled ghost and the lost items. Laura, Freddy, the gardener, Sunshine, and Carrot, a rescued dog, begin to connect as a unit slowly developing the strength to overcome obstacles such as the ugly local rumours concerning Laura. There is a parallel story about Eunice and Bomber, and the tragedies and triumphs that litter their lives through time. The storylines do eventually connect. Interspersed throughout we have entrancing and shocking tales of some of the lost items, and the various situations that the owners found themselves in. Laura, with the help of Freddy and Sunshine, sets up a website documenting the lost collection only to find it becomes so much more than she envisaged.Ruth Hogan has weaved an intelligent, magical and fantastical tale of loss, love, heartbreak, redemption and hope. It is infused with whimsy and laugh out loud humour. It is beautifully written, and wonderfully descriptive. The wide ranging characters are what really makes the book, including the minor ones like the monstrous Portia and her ghastly novels. I cannot recommend this book enough, it is an enchanting contemporary fairytale and a great read. Many thanks to John Murray Press for an ARC."}, {"userName": "Elyse", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse", "userReview": "Library ebookOnce in-awhile a book comes along that feels a little lacy, dressy, decorous, cultivated, rosy, sweet, courteous, cordial, romantic, a little mysterious, quirky, touching, sad, humorous, warm, cozy, and loving. AND YOU\u2019RE UP FOR THE TASK! This novel was very unexpected- I not only mean the novel itself\u2014 but my enjoyment of absolutely EVERYTHING ABOUT IT. I consider myself to be a modern woman \u2014- I rarely tap into an appreciation for people\u2019s sentimental tchotchkes. I \u2018did\u2019 ......tap into my appreciation for the smallest \u2018lost things\u2019. Silly me! Darn....where is that hair clip I lost- which I use to love? Would one of you please return it to Westgate Ave. in San Jose? Thank you, kindly!There are two plot-timelines. Both were engaging\u2014-but there was also a \u2018third\u2019 treat: stories within the storytelling. They were good! Afterall the Gentleman- Anthony Peardew, \u201cKeeper of Lost Things\u201d, was a writer! When housekeeper Laura inherits the job as \u201cKeeper of Lost Things\u201d....and tries to reunite them to their owner, she gets inventive, and gains new friends. The quiet calm tea drinking novel takes off - things get a little wacky - fun. Great characters \u2014from gentle tranquil comforting ones to a downright wicked woman. Oh my gosh..... please enjoy your favorite drink tea \u2018 properly \u2018 when you read this novel .....Ha....Here is an excerpt that might warm some readers hearts ( if you\u2019re in the mood as I was).... or perhaps you\u2019d like to skip that page.....but I cherished it! A little context first: Laura was interviewing for the job as housekeeper/personal assistant. She fell in love with the house right away- the Padua. Anthony would later hire her. He became her employer and close friend for 40 years. The day of the interview: \u201c Anthony had made her tea at the interview. He had brought it into the garden room; teapot with cozy, milk jug, sugar bowl and tongs, cups and saucers, silver teaspoons, tea strainer and stand. All set out on a tray with a tray cloth. Pure white, lace \u2013edged linen. The tray cloth was definitive. Padua was clearly a house where all these things, including the tray cloth, were part of every day life\u201d. Ha.... and that\u2019s the way I prepare tea in my house every day, several times a day. Why don\u2019t you believe me? Old-Fashion values - decorum- manners - I found it to be enchanting! Lovely book ....read it when you\u2019re in that special mood!!!"}, {"userName": "Esil", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil", "userReview": "Charming, light and whimsical are the words I would use to describe The Keeper of Lost Things. Set in England, the story features two parallel stories that ultimately come together quite nicely. One story features middle aged Laura who inherits a house full of lost objects which she is tasked with reuniting with their owners. The other story features the lengthy unlikely friendship between Eunice and Bomber. What makes this one good are the details such as stories about the lost objects and Laura's friendship with a neighbourhood girl. The writing is fluid and enjoyable. I gather this is Ruth Hogan's debut, and I hope she writes more books because she is a lovely storyteller. Had I known that a slight tolerance for ghosts, magic and over the top coincidences are required to enjoy The Keeper of Lost Things, I may have been hesitant to give it a try. But none of this ended up interfering with my appreciation of this one.

Sometimes you have to believe, that things happen for a reason. And this book, certainly points that out.Anthony Peardew is the keeper of lost things. His wife died many years ago. On the day she died, on the way to meet her, Anthony lost some precious item that she gave to him and made him promise to always keep with him. Anthony was distraught at loosing his wife and also the one item that would keep his promise and keep him close to her. So, in turn, he began to collect things that others had lost, hoping to return those items to them. He meticulously documented the items he found, eventually writing stories about them. Laura, who is completely lost, after marrying a dolt of a husband she probably never loved, comes to be Anthony's housekeeper at a wonderful home. When Anthony passes, he leaves the house to her and a condition, that she begins to return the lost things to their rightful owners. And so begins this wonderful tale. Throw in a small little love story, a wonderful neighbor Sunshine, a girl with disabilities, and you have such a heartwarming story. But there is also another interweaving story line - Eunice, who has lost something and lost the love of her life (literally). But Eunice has also found something and these two stories come together.OK, so in the end it was a bit predictable. There was a bit much going on too. At times, you also heard the stories that Anthony wrote about the lost items, then you throw a ghost into the mix. Wait...what? Honestly, I would have preferred to focus on Laura's story. But I didn't care. Such a wonderful thing, to return items to people who have lost them, often times, it was more the memory of the item that made them happy, rather than the item itself. But for me, the standout was the lovely character of Sunshine. I love her. I listened to this one via audio and enjoyed it tremendously. However, sometimes I got lost a bit in the switching of stories back and forth and wish I had the print. Overall, a read I would suggest to anyone who wants a quick, quirky read that will lift their spirits."}, {"userName": "Phrynne", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne", "userReview": "This book was a real pleasure to read. It had a bit of everything, romance, ghostly presences, magic, mystery and clever literary references being just some. I enjoyed all of the characters especially Sunshine with her quirky speech and odd ways. Two main stories alternate and meander gently through the book, interspersed with lovely anecdotes about the lost things. Some of these are quite sharp and counteract the general sweetness of the book. Mind you this is a book which starts and ends with a biscuit tin full of someone's earthly remains so it is not all sweetness and light!At the end I discover that this is a debut novel (impressive), the author comes from Bedford in the U.K (so do I) and that she wrote much of the book while she was being treated for cancer.

Okay, this was really bad! Maybe my expectations for this book were a bit too high since I picked it up because it was nominated for Goodreads\u2019 Best Fiction 2017, but I can\u2019t say I understand why it\u2019s on this list. \u201cThe Keeper of Lost Things\u201d is, in my opinion, a mediocre and sentimental love story that operates with superficial characters and unbelievable scenes. For instance, The Keeper of Lost Things turns out to be an old man who collects lost things he finds and then writes down where and when he found them. One thing I did like about this part, though, was that he\u2019s a writer who writes cute and imaginative stories to go along with these lost things. Then, he decides to pass his huge collection on to his house assistant and asks her to make sure everything finds its home, and this is when the story began unravelling to me, because she accepts this challenge as a way to make up for her being a huge disappointment to her parents? I found a lot of the story to be superficial and too convenient. For instance, there is a scene in which two men meet for the first time. One man asks the other man whether he likes being a taxi driver, and the other man says yes but then elaborates with an incident in his early career in which he ran down a man? \u201cBut don\u2019t tell my daughter\u201d, he adds. Who in their right mind would share such an incident within the first sentences of a conversation? The beginning of this novel was kind of enchanting, but as my reading progressed my interest took a turn, and by the end I read with a constant cringing of my toes.

But she never came, and by the time he got home that day, he had lost them both. He went back to look for the medallion. He searched the streets and gutters, but he had known that it was a hopeless task. It was as though he had lost her twice. It was the invisible thread that would have connected him to her even after she was gone, but now it was broken along with his promise to her. And so it was that he began to gather other people's lost things; gather them in and keep them safe, just in case one day, one of them could mend a broken heart, and thus redeem a broken man.\"The Keeper of Lost Things is a delightful debut by British novelist Ruth Hogan. The story centers around two different sets of characters. The primary storyline is modern day and revolves around Laura, an assistant to aging author Anthony Peardew. Laura has suffered some major setback in her life but finds refuge at Padua, Peardew's estate. After her employer dies, Laura is left with the task of finding the owners of all of the lost items that he had collected over the years. The second point of view is told from the perspective of Eunice and centers around her life-long relationship with publisher/employer/ best friend Bomber. The story is beautifully written, humorous, and includes many colorful and charming characters, human and canine, along with a few odious ones. The story really begins to flow after the first forty pages and the pieces of the stories begin to connect. I would describe the novel as a modern day fairy tale in which fantastical events intertwine all of the characters and their fates. It examines love in its many forms and includes literal and figurative ghosts. I highly recommend this novel for anyone looking for a charming, feel-good read."}, {"userName": "Alena", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4456042-alena", "userReview": "I was so drawn to the premise of this book -- a man mourning the loss of the love of his life collects lost objects, hoping to reunite them with their owners, meanwhile writing short stories about each object.

Marcus Aurelius \nAn uplifting, enchanting and marvelously crafted escapist read with minimal fluff and maximum appeal. The Keeper of Lost Things is the perfect antidote for what ails us. As much a tale about the loss of things as people, love and even self, the threads that connect us and the kindness of strangers.Hogan has seamlessly plotted two separate stories, each just as entertaining, while weaving the imagined stories of the lost items throughout. She then added more than a few eccentrics, a feisty spirit and a sweet innocent by the name of Sunshine whom you will come to love, and gave us a story brimming with wit, wisdom and charm galore.Whether The Keeper of Lost Things is a story of happenstance, serendipity or the fickleness of fate is up to each reader to decide, but for me it was a gloriously clever and heartwarming story that belied its simple premise and gave me much to ponder. And I\u2019ve already put her new novel, The Wisdom of Sally Red Shoes on my list for when I need a small dose of frothy, feel-good bookishness.__________Excerpt from an interview with Ruth Hogan for those of us who like to know the inspiration for a story and just a teeny bit more: The Keeper Of Lost Things began with a single sentence that came into my head on a train journey and that sentence eventually became the first line of the novel. But it took a while for me to come up with the rest of the story. I often describe myself as a documentary junkie, and the more weird and wonderful the topic, the more it interests me. I\u2019m forever cutting things out of magazines and newspapers, and the plot for Keeper was initially sparked by two news articles \u2013 the first about the strange things that end up in Lost Property Departments, and the second about the fate of cremation remains that are never claimed from funeral directors. My leading man, Anthony Peardew, was inspired by a former neighbour of mine who, I was told, became a reclusive hoarder after the tragic death of his fianc\u00e9e. I named him Anthony and gave him a house called Padua, because Saint Anthony of Padua is the patron saint of lost things. Peardew was a little joke that I had with myself. It is pronounced in the same way as \u2018perdu\u2019 \u2013 the French word for \u2018lost.\u2019 Anthony\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, Therese, was named after Saint Therese of Lisieux, who was also known as Saint Therese of the Roses, which just happen to be my favourite flowers."}, {"userName": "Steve Walsh", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25246765-steve-walsh", "userReview": "I was sent a copy of The Keeper of Lost Things by Goodreads, which means that it is a shame that I feel duty bound to put up a review of this book.

I don't even know where to start. Maybe with a single positive - the first three chapters were quite good, and it's a terrible shame that Anthony Peardew didn't stick around because things went decidedly downhill after he died. I started to really worry about the book when it became clear that there would be no shift in the narrative voice whatsoever - and what I mean by that is that, when the little 'stories behind the items' were included, they were narrated in the exact same manner as the text that had come before it, with Laura in centre stage. Given that they were supposed to have been written by Anthony, this was a grievous mistake. Now I'm no stranger to alliteration and similes and I understand the purpose that they serve. However, Hogan took this TOO FAR. Everything was an alliteration - Poisonous Portia, Slinked seductively into the salon (everything was alliterated, all the time!) and the clich\u00e9s were never-ending. The dialogue was nothing short of embarrassing, 'Liar Liar Pants on Fire!' Etc etc. I don't think anyone speaks to friends and family like that. By far the most AWFUL part of the book was Sunshine, the 'dancing drome' character with Down Syndrome. This was truly, truly appalling and really quite shameful. 'Is it time for the lovely cup of tea' will haunt me until my dying day. What a horrendous sentence to impose upon the character, whose sole purpose *seems* to have been to provide some comedy for the woeful characters that were her 'friends' - such as best friend and 'heroine' Laura who mocks her, hides from her in the larder and, at no point I would argue, is likeable in any sense. In fact, despite Anthony's belief that she is a tortured soul who loves the house as much as him ... she spent most of the last 200 pages trashing it in a rage. Added to that Sunshine's preternatural capabilities, a TERRIBLE, predictable and sickly-sweet plot, not to mention another 15,000 similes and cliches ... this was not a good read. AVOID."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/546484-anne", "userReview": "The Keeper of Lost Things by Ruth Hogan is published in hardback by Two Roads Books on 26 January 2017, and is the author's debut novel.Every now and again, a book comes along that can make the reader laugh out loud and then cry within just a couple of pages. The Keeper of Lost Things is one of those books. I have been absolutely entranced by it for the past few days.Anthony Peardew is the keeper of lost things. He has spent most of his life picking up the items that others have lost, taking them home and treasuring them. He began to collect things after losing something of his own, something that was so precious. His aim is that one day he may be able to reunite the lost items with their owners, and heal some broken hearts.Not only does Anthony lovingly store them, and label them, he also writes stories about them. His imagined tales of how the item came to be lost.When Anthony dies, he leaves instructions for his housekeeper and companion, Laura. She must do her best to find the owners, and give back the missing pieces of people's lives.Running parallel with Anthony and Laura's story, the reader learns about Eunice and Bomber - from a different era, but living in similar circumstances with Eunice keeping house for Bomber. These two stories are so cleverly interwoven, and gently overlap towards the end of the book.Ruth Hogan has created a wonderful, beautiful, touching and funny story with some incredibly crafted characters. Each one of them has a distinctive voice, from Portia, the cruel, vindictive sister of Anthony, to Sunshine the lovable neighbour of Anthony and Laura.I adored the stories that Anthony wrote about the missing items, I howled with laughter whilst reading about the blue jigsaw piece and sniffled quite a bit when it came to the white umbrella. The imagination and creativity that has gone into each short story, alongside the expertly written main plot is amazing.This story is multi-layered, with a range of themes. It's a love story, it has a bit of magic, there are ghosts and story-telling. The author explores family dynamics, relationships, illness and loss, and all are dealt with beautifully and with feeling.The Keeper of Lost Things is an absolute delight. It is gentle and charming and full of wisdom. I loved every pagehttp://randomthingsthroughmyletterbox..."}, {"userName": "Saoirse Milotte", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42369733-saoirse-milotte", "userReview": "Laura has nothing left to lose when she applies for a job as a housekeeper and secretary for writer Anthony Peardew. Her marriage to her cheating childhood sweetheart has collapsed, her burning desire for children was never fulfilled and she has no education to speak of. Anthony\u2019s house is like a balm on her soul, quiet, beautiful and filled with the bitter sweet memories of Anthony\u2019s dead wife. There is only one room, the study, that she is not permitted to enter. When Anthony dies and leaves her everything Laura is shocked, especially when she learns there is a caveat to the will. Inside the study is a lifetime\u2019s worth of lost objects that Anthony has collected and meticulously catalogued. He wants Laura to reunite them with their owners and complete his life\u2019s work.This novel has a little of everything, mystery, history, magic, ghosts and romance. Some aspects are great and some are not. First, the parts that did not work. The ghost of Anthony\u2019s wife, and the magical ability of Sunshine, a neighbouring girl with Down Syndrome who becomes firm friends with Laura, seem a little forced. Rather than manifesting themselves slowly they appear as and when the plot needs to develop. The relationship with Freddy the gardener also feels a little flat, and truly the story would have been all the better had Laura built herself into a strong independent woman without him. It is a colour by numbers romance: hot, mysterious, silent man; woman who believes she could never be considered attractive again; lots of misunderstandings...it never really rings true. Finally, there is something a little snobbish about some of the descriptions that pop out like a poke in the eye. In one instance Laura describes the girls her husband has affairs with as \u2018the kind of girls that drop their knickers as quickly as they drop their aiches\u2019, there were also some comments about single mothers on benefits all smoking Benson and Hedges that were irksome. Now whether these are Laura\u2019s opinions, a woman who admits she wished to escape her poor upbringing for the kind of life that has tea-tray doilies, or the author\u2019s own, remains to be seen.Now for the parts that work. The flash back stories linked to each object are fabulous and show Hogan\u2019s incredible skill at creating immediately relatable characters. Each story is an absolute gem, giving sufficient information to peak your interest but leaving enough unsaid to have you wondering what happened next. The descriptions of the house are rich enough for the reader to believe they are there, and Anthony\u2019s character is fascinating. Beyond all else though, it is the concurrent story of Eunice and Bomber, which runs throughout the book that is an absolute joy to read. Eunice is gregarious, colourful and full of life, while Bomber fills the page with his personality making it easy to see why Eunice falls in love with him. The descriptions of their small publishing office, their dogs and their beautiful, platonic relationship throughout the years are exceptional and so believable that you will feel like you are saying goodbye to friends when you finish the last page. Their story will have you laughing and crying in turn, making them the true stars of this novel."}, {"userName": "Syndi", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1656405-syndi", "userReview": "i am surprise by this book. i though its going to be boring book. reading couple first chapters it does looks very very boring. but then it gets very intereting about 45%. see how magical it is for the keper of lost things collecting lost objects and try to reunite it with the owner. or at least putting it on narrative. i always though lost things uave their own story. story about the joy, the lost, the salvation of the owner. delightful reading."}], "description": "Once a celebrated author of short stories now in his twilight years, Anthony Peardew has spent half his life lovingly collecting lost objects, trying to atone for a promise broken many years before.Realising he is running out of time, he leaves his house and all its lost treasures to his assistant Laura, the one person he can trust to fulfil his legacy and reunite the thousands of objects with their rightful owners.But the final wishes of the Keeper of Lost Things have unforeseen repercussions which trigger a most serendipitous series of encounters...With an unforgettable cast of characters that includes young girls with special powers, handsome gardeners, irritable ghosts and an array of irresistible four-legged friends, The Keeper of Lost Things is a debut novel of endless possibilities and joyful discoveries that will leave you bereft once you've finished reading.WE'RE ALL JUST WAITING TO BE FOUND...", "title": "The Keeper of Lost Things", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33815380-the-keeper-of-lost-things", "average": 3.84, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1483832501l/33815380.jpg", "reviews": 3505, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15305372.Ruth_Hogan", "name": "Ruth Hogan"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Contemporary", "Fantasy"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33815380-the-keeper-of-lost-things", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30363088-the-keeper-of-lost-things", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33828785-the-keeper-of-lost-things", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33828677-the-keeper-of-lost-things", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34217557-the-keeper-of-lost-things", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33828743-the-keeper-of-lost-things", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36052194-o-guardi-o-dos-objetos-perdidos", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34856247-the-keeper-of-lost-things", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39860004-the-wisdom-of-sally-red-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39880954-la-noyade-pour-les-d-butants", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40059510-vielleicht-tanzen-wir-morgen", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40383104-el-guardi-n-de-los-objetos-perdidos"]}
