Vanessa Van Horne--socialite, landscape architect, photographer, spinster (\"'Young man,' I said; 'what I said to you was: I have never married. I did not say anything about my profession.'\"), survivor of a Japanese internment camp and a series of heart attacks--has spent 45 summers at a family-owned, coastal Maine hotel that has seen better days, as have its guests (one in particular). At heart a murder mystery with an eccentric cast of characters, but beyond that a whimsical, even farcical (but no less sincere for it) study of friendship, loyalty and resiliency in the face of the corrupt military-industrial complex. Lots of tongue-in-cheek snideness about Canadian-American relations in the thinly-disguised Reagan years. Oh, and an iceberg. Probably a 3.5, but I'm feeling generous because I needed something light but engaging and this fit the bill perfectly."}, {"userName": "Maxym Karpovets", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5344121-maxym-karpovets", "userReview": "Timothy Findley is a former actor and radio performer and scriptwriter from Canada who has written one incredible novel (Not Wanted On the Voyage) and quite a few good ones. He won the highest prize of Canadian Literal Association and prize of Canadian Governor-general. The author became popular with publishing two incredible novels \u2013 Piligrim (1999) and Spadework (2001). There is no such thing as a characteristic Findley novel, and this is no exception.The story full of secrets, but don\u2019t believe that it is a simply detective story or thriller. We cannot exactly identify what the author tells us about, because a lot of omissions and suggestions. So, the events take place on the south coast of Maine, at a resort hotel with an assortment of characters. The narrator/protagonist, a middle-aged woman, not only tackles and solves the mystery, but intersperses the main plot with memories of her experiences in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp during the Second World War. We do not really know where the corpse has disappeared, why this death has awakened the attention of politicians from the White House. The only hitch in this story random shots of our elderly lady. Had she ever known how these shots changed her life!People who need to read the translated variant can do this with excellent Russian version in well-famous Inostranka (Nina Fedorova did a brilliant work!). Nevertheless, you might spend a good time with this novel. It\u2019s worth rereading. 4"}, {"userName": "Meaghan", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/740508-meaghan", "userReview": "When elderly pharmaceuticals mogul Calder Maddox dies suddenly on the beach at the Aurora Sands Hotel in Maine, some of the other guests believe there may be more to it than natural causes. The main character is 59-year-old Vanessa Van Horne, a landscape designer and amateur photographer who is drawn into the case because she was there on the beach with her camera when Maddox died, and because some of her closest friends, including Calder's mistress Lily Porter, are involved.The cast of characters in The Telling of Lies consists of mostly older, wealthy people who've spent every summer of their lives at the Aurora Sands Hotel, and consequently have known each other for years. They're an interesting but mostly not terribly likeable bunch. It's an interesting scenario, placing all these people and their various rich people problems together in an isolated location and introducing a shadowy conspiracy into the mix. I like that aspect of it.However, I'm not sure how I feel about the book overall. For much of it, the larger context of Vanessa's suspicions regarding Calder's death is only hinted at: we know there seems to be some kind of larger plot going on, but it was never clear to me why I was supposed to think that the strange goings on had much to do with Calder Maddox and not just a Presidential visit. I couldn't figure out whether the idea was that the President had murdered Maddox, and if he did, why would he do that? It was all unclear.I also felt the parts of the novel about Vanessa's past as a prisoner in Indonesia during World War II were somewhat clumsily written, with a way too large number of \"It reminded me of that time when I WAS IN PRISON\" type sentences and paragraphs to make sure this background was never far from the reader's mind.In the end I did get quite drawn in by the mystery, and the solution was interesting if perhaps a bit unsatisfying, because honestly, I still don't really understand why all the shadowy government presence had to happen."}, {"userName": "Felice Picano", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/351464-felice-picano", "userReview": "The late Timothy Findley is one of Canada's best known and most accomplished authors and its a shame that this delightful and openly gay man didn't write much about GLBT matters or characters. But the novels and stories he did write are excellent. The Wars and Famous Last Words, especially. And now this odd little mystery, set in a conservative, traditional Maine seaside comunity. The narrator is a woman in her sixties and most of the main characters are about that same age. Meaning that they have reached a mature stage in their minds and lives --which is a treat compared to reading about inexperienced immature people being stupid. But in the case of some of the men, it means they've reached a height in their powerful political careers, too. When one of the usual guests of the hotel is suddenly found dead, everyone seems to be willing to believe it was illness. But some of the regulars easily see what is not routine about it, and they come to think it was much more than that -- murder. When they begin to investigate, they unearth an amazing, complex, and dangeorus spiderwork of connections leading to the White House and the Congress of the U.S. where power has corrupted absolutely. In this novel, men and women are equal in ability, interestm and eagerness to get themselves into peril-- which is true in life. As one woman says testily when she is called a spinster-- \"That is not my profession, I've never spun thread in my life.\" The book won an Edgar Award for best mystery of the year."}, {"userName": "Garlan \u270c", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1979703-garlan", "userReview": "I was a little disappointed in this book after having read \n and \n.

The writing was still good, but the story wasn't very compelling, and I had no deep interest in any of the characters.

I was moderately intrigued for two-thirds of the page count...only for the novel to completely lose my interest after the introduction of a bevy of new characters that overload the story and stretch out the plot for another 100 unnecessary pages.
