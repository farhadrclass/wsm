And Scaachi Koul did not dissaopint with her wry humor and telling insights on a plethora of subjects. Dealing with fear, anxiety, grief, parenting, insecurities, racial discrimination, racial advantage, shadism, white privilege, sexism, feminism, online harassment, sexual harassment, diversity in media, and so much more. Koul won my heart over almost instantly with her essays.\nSourceBut most of all, I knew I was a goner when she talked about her family. Getting to read about a small piece of her Kashmiri family history was intoxicating. I wanted more and more and more. Her parents remain two of the most caring and daring ones I've had the pleasure to read as of late.And I'm not even kidding when I say that most of my favorite pieces were about them. I mean:\u201cMy dad first saw her at his cousin\u2019s house\u2014my mom was her friend\u2014and was flustered by her beauty. Ask my dad and he\u2019ll wax poetic about my mother\u2019s cheekbones, her rich eyes, her long hair, how he needed to get to know her. My mom didn\u2019t even know he was there.\u201d#GOALS.\u201cNothing bad can happen to you if you\u2019re with your mom. Your mom can stop a bullet from lodging in your heart. She can prop you up when you can\u2019t. Your mom is your blood and bone before your body even knows how to make any.\u201dDaughters showing love for their mothers is how my heart remains fulfilled.\u201cIn the fifth grade, I got my hair chopped off in an ill-advised pixie cut, some two feet of dark black hair sheared off me like a sheep. Mom gathered it all and stuffed it into a heavy-duty Ziploc bag. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked her as she tucked the bag into her purse. \u201cWhen you\u2019re older,\u201d she said, \u201cyou\u2019re going to get married, and this we can use for hair extensions on your wedding day.\u201d She put the hair in the deep-freezer in the garage and it\u2019s still there; sometimes when I root around for Pizza Pockets I will instead pull out a bag filled with my DNA. My mother would like a wedding, please, and it is not optional.\u201dThis is so extra. I love it.\n\n\u201cPapa ends most of his calls with me the way you might close a conversation with someone you want to menace. \u201cAnyway,\u201d he\u2019ll say, \u201cI\u2019ll be here. Staring into the abyss.\u201d Or, when I have given him good news, \u201cThe talented will rule and the rest will perish in the sea of mediocrity.\u201d Or, when I have given him bad news, \u201cI am sorry for everything that happens to you, as everything is my fault.\u201d HE\u2019S SOMETHING ELSE\u2026\u201cWhen he started watching The Wire he answered the phone with \u201cWhat up?\u201d or \u201cWho dat?\u201d or some other linguistic appropriation that does not actually appear in the show. If I don\u2019t acknowledge this greeting (perhaps with a similarly enthusiastic, \u201cIt\u2019s ya boy\u201d), he will say it another two or three times. It\u2019s important that you notice this good mood he is in, because it is fleeting.\u201dReal talk, I want a whole book where Scaachi Koul gets to talk solely about her dad, please. 5/5 stars just for him. And so I loved how each essay ended with a snippet from one of her emails with her dad. I got to a point where I was looking forward to see what would be shared next at the end of each written piece.\u201cNone of this\u2014the impatience, the frustration, the willingness to hold a grudge against an inanimate object\u2014is new to me. He\u2019s always been waiting for something to ruin his life. When I was little and would pretend to be a doctor and he my patient, he\u2019d ask me surprisingly real questions about his hypertension and cholesterol, when all I wanted to do was \u201ctest his reflexes\u201d by hitting him in the shin with a plastic mallet. He colours with Raisin but wants her to do something more \u201ccerebral\u201d with her talents. \u201cNo, don\u2019t colour like that,\u201d he says. \u201cColour in the lines. The lines! Well, if you\u2019re going to do it that way, at least do some Cubist-inspired art. Show your inner angst. Show how angry you are at the establishment!\u201d She frowns at him and tries to ignore his commands. \u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cColour Dora\u2019s face.\u201dThis is the quality content I'm here for.Also, I lived for this iconic moment when her dad was introduced to Scaachi's older (by thirteen years) boyfriend:\u201cThey shook hands. Papa led him into the kitchen, where all serious family matters tend to take place. He offered Hamhock tea. \u201cYou look good,\u201d Papa said. \u201cFor someone your age.\u201d Let me rephrase, this is not an iconic scene this is THE iconic scene. However, since I kind of disliked her boyfriend a lot, my enjoyment was lowered every time he was mentioned. (Which turned out to be quite a lot for a memoir...)But circling back to the positives, all of the pieces are entertaining, riveting and humorous, but some worked better for me than others. Like, the piece on body hair -which I'm still beyond grateful that someone finally wrote about in a book- remains one of my favorite essays.\u201cI didn\u2019t shave more of it off. I didn\u2019t want James to know he had gotten to me, so I figured I\u2019d wait until the summer, the way I did for my moustache and brows, so that everyone would just forget I ever had hair in the first place. In class, though, James noticed the bald patch on my forearm. He laughed. \u201cDid you try shaving your arm because I told you that you were hairy?\u201dJames works in finance now. He lives in Boston. We are all eventually punished for our sins.\u201dTHIS GIRL.\nAnd last but not least, this crucial piece on social media and interaction:\u201cWho do you even talk to on Twitter?\u201d Papa asked me after I told him I had rejoined. \u201cWho could be so important there?\u201d I thought about my family\u2019s traditional Kashmiri last name, how any other Kashmiri can point us out in a phone book and know where we\u2019re from. This has, literally, happened: when I was still living at home, a recent immigrant looked up our listed number, called us, and asked if he could come over to talk to my parents and get some help integrating. Mom made him fried vangan and Papa offered him chai and I was perplexed that my otherwise very private, very protective parents let a complete stranger stroll into their home just because he came from the same region they did. But they were trying to find connection, to talk to someone who understood them. I will likely have to tell you, here, that vangan is eggplant, but online, I can find someone in mere seconds who already knows that. Our worlds become a little smaller, we feel closer, we feel less alone.\u201dOne Day We'll All Be Dead and None of This Will Matter is something I won't be forgetting anytime soon. Candid, outspoken, laugh-out-loud funny essays are the way to my heart. And I hope we'll get to see similar books released in the very near future because I crave more and more and more. \nNote: I'm an Amazon Affiliate.

The first essay really got to me, which I wasn't expecting.

One Day We'll All Be Dead and None of This Will Matter is an engaging collection of personal essays. The author is a young Canadian woman who's family is originally from India. She grew up in Calgary and lives in Toronto. Her personal essays deal with, amongst other topics, family, relationships, race, body image, hair, drinking, family weddings and her parents' reaction to her older white boyfriend. Her essays feel young, irreverent, angry and honest -- at times bordering on a bit too much honesty for me. There is also plenty of humour and the odd swear word. Many times, Koul made me feel old, but I enjoyed the window into her world.

She really won my heart with her essay about clothing, and the hopes we women pin on finding just the right shirt, skirt, or jeans.It's happening, I thought. The item, the big item that changes the way I dress and thereby changes the way I am as a person. It's not just a skirt; it's the entry fee for a better existence. I would exude a new confidence, it would smooth out the wrinkles in my body, it would hide all the ways I have disappointed and failed people in the past. While wearing it, women would approach me and beg me to tell them where I got it. I would act coy and wink to the camera (in this version of the fantasy, I am perpetually in a commercial; don't worry about it) and say something like, \"I'll never tell\" or \"Oh, just something I picked up.\" People would see me on the street shoving fistfuls of Teddy Grahams into my mouth on the way to the podiatrist, and they would think, \"Boy, that lady sure does have her life together.\"Koul sparked a real shit-storm in early 2016, when she asked that submissions to BuzzFeed Canada be from people \"not white and not male.\" She received so many angry online tweets, she began responding with quotes from Good Will Hunting, but she closed her Twitter account after getting too many rape and death threats. I was getting a few hundred notifications a day, all largely negative, all vaguely menacing. Many of the essays deal with family, particularly the author's strained though frequently hilarious relationship with her father. Papa Koul is fond of using the silent treatment as a way of punishing his daughter's transgressions. Despite the grief she has obviously caused him, he was kind enough to write a very funny author bio for this book. Maybe everyone is just mellowing with age.Few things get less complicated as you age, but your family, that at least should become easier. You should eventually make peace with everyone, with their decisions and their quirks. With your parents in particular, you should fight less because you have less time to fight.In all, not a bad collection of essays from a gal who's only 26 years old.AND, she really knows how to rock red lipstick, something I've never been able to master."}, {"userName": "emma", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32879029-emma", "userReview": "I mostly just found this profoundly...eh.

One of those books was ONE DAY WE'LL ALL BE DEAD AND NONE OF THIS WILL MATTER by Scaachi Koul, a culture writer for BuzzFeed Canada.I'd been looking forward to this book for a while. I love BuzzFeed and I had heard that this book was going to address many topics like feminism and racism and cultural identity. Plus, it's written by someone who's roughly my own age, give or take a few years, and it's always amazing to read books written from someone in your generation - especially if their observations are written from a different perspective than your own. It's like seeing the world with new eyes...for better or for worse.ODWABDaNoTWM is about Koul growing up in Canada in the 90s and early 2000s. The daughter of immigrant parents from India, she was in the unique position of being the only \"brown person\" in an area of Canada that didn't have many minorities at the time (I'm blanking on the exact location, but I believe it was a part of Calgary that was mostly white). She writes, with candidness and humor, about internal and external racsim; sexism; interracial relationships; rape culture; substance abuse; beauty standards; and dating. She's incredibly witty and makes some very cutting observations on Canadian and Indian culture, but she also talks about what she loves about these two different cultures, too, and how they have helped shape her identity and make her into the person she is now. Also, her relationship with her family, especially her parents, is both endearing and hilarious. I love how she includes some of her emails to her dad.I really loved this book. Koul brings a fresh perspective to the millennial memoir collective, which seems to be mostly overrun by YouTube celebrities and pop stars. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but I prefer books with a little more substance. This is the second book I've read that was written by current- or ex-BuzzFeed staff (the first was I HATE EVERYONE BUT YOU by Allison Raskin and Gaby Dunn) and let me tell you, I am impressed. Both ODWABDaNoTWM and I HATE EVERYONE BUT YOU are pitch-perfect and culturally relevant, discussing many relevant and controversial issues that millennials - especially female millennials - face on a day to day basis.You should definitely read this.4 to 4.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Lata", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13126933-lata", "userReview": "I found myself laughing out loud as I read.

In her debut, Koul tackles regular essay collection stuff\u2014meditations on relationships, family, identity \u2013 but the best part of it is that she\u2019s funny as sh*t.I laughed out loud on a dozen occasions throughout this book, from her descriptions of a torturously long five-day family wedding in Jammu to stranger details. For instance, Koul refers to her boyfriend affectionately as \"Hamhock,\" a \u201csweet, precious moron\u201d; she hides packets of sweet-and-sour sauce in her bra. One essay starts with this line: \u201cLike farts and the incorrect retellings of classic literature, racism is a lot cuter when it comes out of a little girl.\u201dKoul was raised in Alberta, Canada, her Kashmiri parents having immigrated from India. She writes often about her family, and if there\u2019s a strong thread that runs through the book, it\u2019s one of lineage. Koul has inherited parents\u2019 anxieties and fears, the baggage that comes with being born brown.Beyond the personal, some essays cover topics about the larger evils of the world. For instance, \u201cMute\u201d details the Twitter backlash Koul experienced when she encouraged non-white, non-male people to contribute to BuzzFeed (where Koul works). Alt-right poster-boy Milo Yiannopoulos sent his followers after her, which turned into a terrifying flood of rape and death threats. Learning about her experience firsthand will make you shiver and want to lock your virtual internet twitter deadbolt door. Koul reveals a core truth about Internet trolls: \u201cwhat they say to me online is the purest distillation of the rage they feel.\u201dBut the most powerful essay in the book is \u201cHunting Season,\u201d which illuminates the way men prey on women. We're talking about observation on the most primal level. \u201cMen watch women at the gym, at work, on the subway: in any space occupied by men and women, the women are being watched,\u201d Koul writes. The perils of course are steepest at the bar: as Koul says, \u201cWhen a guy asks to buy you a drink, suggest he buy you a snack instead and see how that goes over.\u201dIn the end, it becomes clear the title of the book is a bit of a joke. One day we will all be dead, but after reading Koul's essays, you'll recognize that these things do matter. They matter so damn much.Read more at https://www.bookofthemonth.com/one-da..."}, {"userName": "Carol (Bookaria)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1880531-carol-bookaria", "userReview": "Wonderful memoir from Buzzfeed senior writer Scaachi Koul.

We don't even have a resolution to the alcoholic's story- she never explained what happened to him, only about how she was mad for a while and now she's over it?

I think my favorite sections of the book are about Koul's family. Oh, how I wish her dad had a Twitter account...The book is entertaining and youthful, but also surprisingly thoughtful. I appreciated Koul's honesty and willingness to poke fun at herself. There are some preachy moments that irritated me, but Koul's earnestness keeps the collection grounded. It's easy for me to see that she's just genuinely trying to figure life out, and I like and respect her for that. So One Day We'll All Be Dead (etc.), is a quick, light read.

I hope Koul keeps writing, because I am definitely interested in reading her future books.ARC provided by publisher through Net Galley.See more of my reviews at www.BugBugBooks.com."}, {"userName": "Alice Lippart", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27078093-alice-lippart", "userReview": "A funny, interesting and heartfelt collection.

We rarely acknowledge it, and when we do, we're punished, as if we're speaking badly of an elderly relative who can't help but make fun of the Irish.\nWith One Day We'll All Be Dead And None Of This Will Matter, Scaachi Koul joins the ranks of other web-based writers \u2013 like Lindy West or Jenny Lawson \u2013 who have lately collected essays into book form, and as with these other writers, I find Koul's writing to be smart, funny, and self-deprecating; a suitable tone for exploring weighty ideas without getting all heavy about them. Yet I confess to finding a samey-sameness to this writing \u2013 to the web-shaped voice; the breezy confessionals; the casual f-bombs \u2013 and when one could be reading their ideas for free and at leisure on BuzzFeed, Jezebel, or The Bloggess (when I never personally seek out long-form web-based writing; pretty sure I'm not the target audience for your average BuzzFeed article), I need a reason to pick up one of these books. I was led to ODWABDANOTWM by a glowing newspaper review, and happily for me, as she is the Calgary-born daughter of Kashmiri immigrants, Koul does have an interesting and unique viewpoint \u2013 on being a Canadian, and a woman, and a bridge between two cultures \u2013 and I was enlightened and entertained by the whole thing.\nOnly idiots aren't afraid of flying. Planes are inherently unnatural; your body isn't supposed to be launched into the sky, and few people comprehend the science that keeps them from tumbling into the ocean. Do you know how many planes crash every year? Neither do I, but the answer is more than one, WHICH IS ENOUGH.\nKoul opens her book with an essay about a trip she took to Thailand with her boyfriend Hamhock, and this allows her to introduce the three most important people in her life: the boyfriend who encourages Koul to do the things that scare her, and the overprotective parents who try to keep her safe by promoting fear. She deals with outright racism and subtle shadeism \u2013 in India Koul is considered very light-skinned, but in Alberta she was the brown kid; she recognises and is uncomfortable with her own shadeism (and especially as it relates to her niece, Raisin, whose mother is white) \u2013 and details the time that trolls (calling for her rape and murder) forced her off Twitter for a while. She writes about party-culture at university and rape-culture in general (and the two times she was roofied); she writes about learning to accept her body and the futility of fighting against it with clothes and compulsive grooming. And throughout it all, Koul speaks long distance to her parents every day; needing to hear their voices as much as they need the reassurance of hers. The essays are broken up by email exchanges she has had with her father throughout the years, and each of them made me laugh at his quirkiness. After reading about their visits back to India (and Koul's rejection of sexism and patriarchy and all the old, traditional ways she finds there), the final essay \u2013 in which Hamhock forces Koul to finally tell her parents about him (after four years together) \u2013 didn't end the way I expected: Although they liked Hamhock when they met in person, Koul's parents were adamant that the older, white man wasn't suitable for their daughter. And when she moved in with him despite their objections, Koul's father stopped talking to her for months, with the following serving as the semi-hopeful ending to the book:\nPapa has never been the strongest person in the family \u2013 that's always been Mom, who carries everyone's burdens on her back. He's never been the most stubborn either \u2013 that's always been me. He's not even the most sullen \u2013 that's my brother, at least since my birth. But Papa will crack, putting his surly contemplations about my relationship aside for good and not just in temporary bursts, as suggested last week when he answered the phone with, \u201cThe vagaries of time are taking their toll\u201d (believe that this is him in a good mood), or a month before when he ended our call with, \u201cYou are brave, you are too brave.\u201d Or at least I need to believe in his ability to let things go when they are ultimately out of his control, because otherwise we're both just alone, spinning separately when we're supposed to be in this together.\nI found that a sad note to end on. Like Koul, I have lived in Alberta, and although I currently live within an hour of her on the other side of the country, my experience as a (older, white) Canadian woman couldn't be more different. I might not have found much unique about the web-shaped voice Koul writes in, but her story is entirely her own, and worth hearing."}, {"userName": "Susan Feng", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64511856-susan-feng", "userReview": "It's nearly 1 AM, but it felt important to get this down in the moment. It's been a while since I've finished a book in the middle of the night, and when I closed this book after reading the last few pages of acknowledgements, I cried. Heavy, hot, mysterious tears, my sinuses stinging.I can't pin point why I'm weeping. Maybe it's because I too grew up as the child of first-generation immigrant parents who worked hard, harder than they should've ever had to. Parents who loved me the best way they knew, but often clashed with this incomprehensible hybrid of a daughter they had as I grew older.Her experiences from her trips to India were at once not at all the same and exactly the same as mine the two times I've flown to China in the last sixteen years. The frustration of the stifling customs mingled with the melancholy of knowing you've lost parts of yourself, your history, your people's history.Beyond that, her explorations into what it is to be a woman in Western society: a woman with opinions, a woman who drags uncomfortable topics into the spotlight, or simply a woman who's had too much to drink. I've been lucky to not have experienced abuse or trauma, but I remember every injustice, professional or personal, that have happened to the women in my life. I remember all too well the time I half-carried my roofied friend out of a house party and took her to the emergency room.Scaachi's voice is unique, fierce, unapologetic. Her humour cuts like a knife, threaded deftly through the sometimes heavy topics of her essays. She achieved the rarity in writing, producing something that made me feel a striking connection, a clarity, a sense of recognition.I look forward to her future work, and I wish all the good things for her.

I knew a bit about Scaachi Koul from some of her Buzzfeed essays, but didn't quite know what I was in for with this book. Yet, from the very first essay, I was emotionally hooked. Koul weaves a kind of intimacy through these essays that is sometimes absent in other memoir essay collections (sorry, Mindy Kaling and Ellen DeGeneres). Despite having had very different upbringings and experiences, I felt a sense of relief reading her essays-- someone else knows how I feel and what I worry about. It is this kernel of raw humanity at the centre of each essay that makes the collection so good. We may not all have been to an Indian wedding, but we all know what parental/family pressure feels like; we may not all have been cut out of a skirt with a stuck zipper in a fitting room, but we all know what feeling insecure about our bodies feels like. The title, depending on how you read it, has two contradictory meanings: one day ... none of this will matter / one day this will matter . Accordingly, Koul tells stories about her life that are seemingly small and ostensibly won't matter in the grand scheme of things, and yet the way she tells them and connects them to shared human experiences (pains, fears, desires, questions) suggests a hope that these small things do matter."}, {"userName": "Bailey", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3506967-bailey", "userReview": "I used to read a lot of these, quirky contemporary essay collections by women, all rising stars in the literary community, fresh voices, unique perspectives.

A month ago I thought it was out but realized that was just in Canada and not the U.S. Found it on Netgalley and finally was able to read it after begging the publisher to approve me on Twitter. :DScaachi Koul is a Buzzfeed writer who\u2019s probably best-known for when she put out a request on Twitter for non-white writers and started a completely undeserved shitstorm. The very people who often disparagingly call liberals \u201cspecial snowflakes\u201d lost their freakin\u2019 minds. Anyway, before I go off on that tangent (and she talks about this whole episode in her life in the book)...Koul is the child of Indian parents, specifically parents from the Kashmir region of India, so that\u2019s another reason I wanted to read this: I\u2019m really interested in reading writing of people with whom I can identify, even a little bit.In that, the book didn\u2019t disappoint. The struggles of an immigrant or the child of immigrants are uphill, especially when you\u2019re younger, and Koul really gets into that, throughout multiple essays. One thing that I think a lot of brown people who grew up here can identify with is this particular line: \u201cI tried to force myself out of brownness at her age, but the older I get, the more I tuck myself into it.\u201d When you\u2019re younger, you try to separate yourself from your culture to fit in (despite all the shit you face from your parents for doing so), but as you grow older you realize what a mistake that was.Fitting is a luxury rarely given to immigrants, or the children of immigrants. We are stuck in emotional purgatory. Home, somehow, is always the last place you left, and never the place you\u2019re in.Some of the strongest parts of the book were when she talked about her parents: their experiences as immigrants, their relationship with her, their perceptions as people living away from their homeland. I saw a lot of my parents reflected in her parents, and it made me consider them in ways that I probably hadn\u2019t enough thought to before. This line especially resonated:So much of immigration is about loss. First you lose bodies: people who die, people whose deaths you missed. Then you lose history: no one speaks the language anymore, and successive generations grow more and more westernized. Then you lose memory: throughout this trip, I tried to place people, where I had met them, how I knew them. I can\u2019t remember anything anymore.Her experience of returning to a place in India as an adult that she\u2019d previously visited only as a kid could have been me doing the same thing in my life. Knowing that others have these same feelings and experiences, and reading about them, is so validating. I\u2019m so glad that voices like Koul\u2019s have a place now in mainstream culture. You don\u2019t think about it actively, but it\u2019s like all the arguments being made for having more than just white people on TV and in movies: Representation matters.The essay on rape culture, Hunting Season, was another stunning, strong piece. I\u2019d actually read it before on Buzzfeed (which leads me to believe that much of the book may be from pieces she\u2019s already written online), but it can certainly be read over and over and shared with everyone you know. Her insights on how men watch women are so on point.Surveillance feeds into rape culture more than drinking ever could. It\u2019s the part of male entitlement that makes them believe they\u2019re owed something if they pay enough attention to you, monitor how you\u2019re behaving to see if you seem loose and friendly enough to accommodate a conversation with a man you\u2019ve never met. He\u2019s not a rapist. No, he\u2019s just offering to buy you a beer, and a shot, and a beer, and another beer, he just wants you to have a really good time. He wants you to lose the language of being able to consent. He\u2019s drunk too, but of course, you\u2019re not watching him like he\u2019s watching you.And of course, the aforementioned chapter on the disgusting harassment she faced on Twitter was another fantastic essay. I highlighted the hell out of that section but I\u2019ll leave just this one quote here:But all things built by humans descend into the same pitfalls: loathing, vitriol, malicious intent. All the things we build in order to communicate, to connect, to find people like us so we feel less alone, and to find people not like us at all so we learn how to adapt, end up turning against us.Basically, throughout most of this book, I would sigh softly and highlight something and reflect on what I\u2019d just read. There were definitely things that Koul writes that I disagree with but hers is an interesting, and often hilarious, perspective to read. I\u2019ve been shouting about this book to everyone, even before I finished it, and I already know a couple people I\u2019ll be buying it for. Highly recommended.Note: I received this book from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."}], "description": "A collection of essays about growing up the daughter of Indian immigrants in Canada, \"a land of ice and casual racism,\" by the cultural observer, Scaachi Koul.In One Day We'll All Be Dead and None of This Will Matter, Scaachi deploys her razor-sharp humour to share her fears, outrages and mortifying experiences as an outsider growing up in Canada. Her subjects range from shaving her knuckles in grade school, to a shopping trip gone horribly awry, to dealing with internet trolls, to feeling out of place at an Indian wedding (as an Indian woman), to parsing the trajectory of fears and anxieties that pressed upon her immigrant parents and bled down a generation. Alongside these personal stories are pointed observations about life as a woman of colour, where every aspect of her appearance is open for critique, derision or outright scorn. Where strict gender rules bind in both Western and Indian cultures, forcing her to confront questions about gender dynamics, racial tensions, ethnic stereotypes and her father's creeping mortality--all as she tries to find her feet in the world.", "title": "One Day We'll All Be Dead and None of This Will Matter", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30658435-one-day-we-ll-all-be-dead-and-none-of-this-will-matter?from_choice=true", "average": 3.78, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1469411966l/30658435.jpg", "reviews": 899, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15117590.Scaachi_Koul", "name": "Scaachi Koul"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Writing", "Autobiography", "Humor"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30658435-one-day-we-ll-all-be-dead-and-none-of-this-will-matter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29635591-one-day-we-ll-all-be-dead-and-none-of-this-will-matter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34510591-one-day-we-ll-all-be-dead-and-none-of-this-will-matter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32794516-one-day-we-ll-all-be-dead-and-none-of-this-will-matter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40391714-one-day-we-ll-all-be-dead-and-none-of-this-will-matter"]}
