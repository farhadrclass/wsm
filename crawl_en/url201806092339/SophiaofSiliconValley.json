Sophia is a recent graduate who becomes employed by the greatest people in the field. Her first boss Scott has a fictional resemblance to Steve Jobs, while her second boss' resemblance is to Elon Musk. The story describes the lessons and experiences of a female in a, somewhat male-dominated field. The novel also depicts Sophia's relationship with her family and romantic interests. I enjoy these types of stories and the novel reminded me the books Startup, The Circle, and Touch which I also enjoyed. Overall, I liked it and recommend it to readers of contemporary fiction.

Your mileage may vary \u2026Sophia Young is the daughter of Taiwanese immigrant parents who manages to be working for Steve Jobs as Pixar\u2019s first animated feature is released, and for Elon Musk at the debut of the Tesla. This is a fictionalized version, though, so it's \u201cScott Kraft\u201d and \u201cTreehouse\u2019s\u201d first animated feature, \u201cTreasures,\u201d and it's \u201cAndre Stark\u201d who unveils the \u201cIon.\u201d There are more real world companies and products referenced, but you get the idea. The back cover insists that the novel is \u201csatirical\u201d but I\u2019m dubious. I\u2019ve always understood satire as involving mockery, but, if there is mockery here it's either overly subtle or I\u2019m just not savvy enough about the subjects to spot it. There is humor in the novel, sure, but it\u2019s more the humor of life, and doesn't seem to be directed at any particular people or institutions. Sophia makes a fine protagonist. Her climb up the career ladder is engaging, and I found myself really rooting for her. The final resolution of the book seems a bit hurried: everything just seems to fall into place a little too easily. But the journey to get there was entertaining enough that I don't really mind.

This is inaccurate. The author/narrator (it's clear that they are one and the same) fawns incessantly over Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, and other of her straight white male mentors. Their unprofessional and verbally abusive behavior, and often sexist and racist comments are passed off as funny in a \"boys will be boys\" sort of way, and their incredible genius (remarked upon constantly) seems to excuse all. The main character Sophia is juvenile, rude, and unprofessional, but we are clearly meant to find her quirky and charming. And how does she show us \"girl power\" in the end? By literally mimicking the abusive behavior and words of her male bosses. It just feels incredibly tone-deaf to release this book in the midst of the growing movement to call to task inappropriate behavior like this. It makes the book seem out-dated and irrelevant, even though it is all about cutting-edge technology. It is saddening to see how one of the few high-powered women in the tech industry (the author) lauds and perpetuates the idea of Silicon Valley as a boy's club in which she is the only woman, and that's due to the fact that she is abusive like a man, and yet constantly flirts to get her way. Yes, I get that this was probably the author's reality, but the problem is that she isn't critical of it all. Another thing that is baffling about this book is how little sense of place or even character she provides. The Devil Wears Prada is not a well-written book, but it definitely gives you a fascinating insider's view of the craziness of the fashion magazine business. I suppose we're supposed to lap up the \"insider\" details about Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, etc., but you don't get a sense of these people at all, and her descriptions of them are so laudatory and fawning, that you would learn more from reading a magazine profile. This novel includes geographical inconsistencies that are glaring, and that, if I didn't know better, would lead me to believe the author hasn't spent much time in Silicon Valley."}, {"userName": "Alexa", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4007897-alexa", "userReview": "I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book.

Part memoir mingled with a little fiction, brassy Sophia is a Chinese American graduate who has the moxie and the smarts to jump from her legal position to a firm that is a copy of Pixar, for a boss who happens to resemble Steve Jobs. All kinds of madcap things happen, from looking for Mr. Right, to getting ill (spoiler alert) to the perfect #metoo revenge. Thrown in for comic relief are her over-protective parents and concerned sister. My favorite parts of the book are the running italicized comments interspersed as the things she\u2019d REALLY like to say to some of the characters.

On the surface, it was a pretty good book - I liked the plot, and the overall storyline of a woman with no tech background suddenly ending up in the tech world. That being said, Sophia was a really frustrating character, and I really struggled with her as a lead. Worse though, were most of the supporting characters. I know it was intentional that her parents were overbearing and pushy, and that Scott was meant to be rude and melodramatic, and that Daniel was self centered and that the poor treatment Ion was meant to be saying stuff about misogyny in Silicon Valley, but that doesn't make it any better.

I'm a younger female professional in the earlier stages of her career and the things Sophia continually struggle with the in the book (can I have the career I want and have a family, is it okay to make your life your career, etc) hit close to home and despite this being a lighter read, I felt as if there was a lot of depth to the book. This is apparently somewhat of a biography for Anna Yen and you can decode a lot of the companies/names in the books and link them directly to the tech-industry powerhouses she discusses - I'm super into that sort of thing so it made me find the book all the more fascinating and entertaining (and honestly it just makes her all the more impressive for all that she accomplished at such a young age!). I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because she points out quite a bit of the sexism/racism/general discrimination she had to deal with in Silicon Valley but very rarely explores the issue in depth so it kept leaving you wanting more/feeling a little incomplete on that topic.

Then, however, it settled down. Clearly Yen knows Silicon Valley and she knows her business, so those interested in a little anti-fan girl for Elon Musk and Steve Jobs will find this entertaining. I found it entertaining for the writing and for the fact that Sophia was dealing with a serious disease (and there's a twist in there that gets a bit of a short shrift.). Note in advance that most of the men are pigs and the women are all working in support roles (except, ironically Sophia's sister who is the rational one in the family.) Silicon Valley culture.

Her pushy Taiwanese mother really hopes that along the way she will maybe find some nice career-oriented partner and she will give up her professional dreams for turning into a dedicated staying-at-home wife. But plans are not supposed to happen anyway, not in this story.Sophia ends up working in top-notch company, ending up giving her time, life and health too for achieving business plans and communicating to strange CEOs, some of the many bizarre successful creatures of the Silicon Valley. References to Pixar or Tesla are pretty obvious, and the writer herself has her own bunch of experience in this field. And the story goes on, with Sophia building her own path, finding a nice doctor boyfriend and climbing to the top, one crazy experience at a time.The story has many useful thoughts about relationships in the era of women with full succcessful careers, with good examples of how to deal at work with crazy difficult people, meditation on life and startups. The new working relationships and environment are definitely changing not only the economy, but are also a challenge from the point of view of the human resources and relations perspective. Through Sophia's interactions the reader not necessarily familiar with this - sometimes unhealthy - lifestyle can get a good glimpse of the Silicon Valley gold digging fever. With a very good intriguing start, the story goes on slow-paced, turning around Sophia and her fast-forward life. The character in itself is likeable, crazy as a bat sometimes, with a colourful way of answering to challenges and an interior life of her own too, but when it comes to complexity, I would expect more details and a different way of reflecting the challenging facts she is exposed too. More than once, I had the feeling that she is over-exposed to way too many things - friendship challenges, dramatic health issues, family craziness - and still she remains completely plain, going on with her life as it is no tomorrow. I would expect Sophia to be as complex as her circumstances were.Otherwise, Sophia of the Silicon Valley is a pleasant weekend or holidays read, either or not you are part of this corporate world. Sometimes it is good to know well in advance if your envy for a certain kind of glamour is reasonable or not.Disclaimer: Book offered by the publisher in exchange for an honest review"}, {"userName": "Charmaine", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8316745-charmaine", "userReview": "Sophia's story is Anna Yen's story, fictionalized. It felt super authentic and captured the zeitgeist of \"the valley\" throughout the 90s and 2000s PERFECTLY. The whole time I was reading, it made me wonder \u2014 who is Anna Yen? And of course, a quick LinkedIn search made it apparent that Ms. Yen IS Sophia. I almost wish this book were non-fiction. But I get it: Anna Yen wanted to cherry-pick experiences and jump around timelines. Maybe she wanted to keep SOME semblance of anonymity (\"Don't worry, you're not that banker she hates...\"). Regardless, all the characters are very thinly veiled. Steve Jobs is clearly Scott Kraft, Ion and Andre Stark are Tesla and Elon Musk, etc. I didn't mind this at all. Anna Yen gave us a lens into the real experience of women in Silicon Valley, and what it takes to be a ruthless, feared, admired, and \"manipulative\" HBIC who gets what she wants. In my books, these are all good terms, and I admire both Sophia and Anna for their unrelenting pursuit to succeed while staying true to themselves. I love that Sophia is a career-driven woman who asks for the moon and MORE... and gets it. She is so business savvy! I admire her and I want to BE her. At the same time, I loved the talk about family, culture, and tradition. Those topics really resonated with me, and I think about them a lot. At times, they feel like such points of conflict for career-minded women who don't want to compromise. It's scary because you don't NEED other people, but you're still raised to want it all. The fact that Asian representation and culture got added in was a sweet bonus, and not something others will understand. I feel like this book was written just for me. One sour note though? I didn't like that the book ended with Sophia telling people want to wear. It felt like such shaming. But upon further reflection, I realized there were some double standards here. Scott SAID these same points to Sophia, so why did I only cringe when Sophia said them? Overall though, great story. FE-MIN-ISM?

New age, women's lit, fun, adventurous...all that. I've read it compares to all the good hyped up women in the forefront type books. Decided this will be the one I take a chance on...work my way to the others.Sophia Of Silicon Valley...if this book was a true life story of an actual women then her and I would be so far from the same it's laughable. Workforce world...hi tech, competitive environment, CEO big boss, big problem type problems....yeah..no clue. And did it matter to me...not at all. I was so engrossed...having such a great time reading this. A well paced story with such depth and wit it was hard not to like it. A fierce and sassy woman struggling to gain her place in Silicon Valley amongst all the men that have an easier time getting to where she had to climb, claw, kick and tackle her way up to. In a way it's like a coming of age...because she, Sophia, has had to learn to come into her own in the business world, in her personal life, and within herself. And that cover....so freakin' charming....I just loved it. can make reading about Silicon Valley..not a foreign experience but an interesting one.

It's like a romance novel about falling in love with work. Or I was describing it to a friend who said it sounded like fan fiction about Silicon Valley, which is probably dead on.The basic plot outline is that Sophia, a 22-ish year old Chinese-American woman living at home with her overprotective parents, has big plans to get a job so she can find a rich husband. But that quickly turns into a joke as she rises quickly within one company and realizes that she'd rather work 120 hours a week than hang out with her boyfriend. In an odd meet cute, she runs into Scott Kraft (aka Steve Jobs) who offers her a job at his new tech startup Treehouse (aka Pixar) and she jumps into a new senior role where she drowns in even more work that she loves even though it kind of makes her crazy and miserable. Then she gets offered another even more impressive job at Ion (aka Tesla) working with Andre Stark (aka Elon Musk). Along the way she realizes that she might be working herself to death and figures out who she wants to be as an adult. Things in the pro column for this book: Sophia was pretty awesome, even if she was really unlikable. She didn't take no for an answer, got things done, and didn't let anyone stand in her way, ever. Not even her mom. Also there was a lot of sexism and racism, and she stomped all over those people. Hmm. That might be it.Things in the con column: All the characters are based on real people, and not even in a thinly-veiled kind of way, which is very odd. Every character is terrible pretty much. There were lots of random little plot inconsistencies. And lots of really bad things happen to people for not any good reason.This was a fun read, but if you're on the fence, I'd probably skip it."}, {"userName": "Shawn Remfrey", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4274512-shawn-remfrey", "userReview": "I've had this on my 'to read' pile for awhile but I kept putting it off because of the cover. I truly despise it. It makes me think that the content of the pages behind it are going to be vapid and insipid and a waste of my time. I truly hope they change it into something more appropriate. The only reason I finally picked it up to read it is that it was sitting right beside me and I was too lazy to get up and walk to the library.The entire story is about a woman, fresh out of college, who is trying to figure out who she is and what the point of her life is. She begins by trying to find the right job so she can find the right husband to take care of her. It all begins with her environment shaping who she is and what she wants. As we delve deeper into the book, we see how her environment continues to shape her and bring out the worst in her, only to have the people she loves and admire continue to counter-balance that.If you're reading the book for the psychology of humanity and it's quest for meaning, then you'll find a lot in here to dissect. If you're reading it for enjoyment, it'll while away a few hours and you won't feel like they were wasted. Make sure you grab a doughnut for this read though, as you'll find several moments where you just need a snack. If you're a book club, rare as they may be these days, you'll find this to be a wonderful piece to read and pick apart together.

It blends in the requisite Starbucks cup (representing caffeine, which is the only thing that'll get you through a 20 hour work day) with the major plots of the book - a girl, earning money, unlucky in love, and tethered to technology. It's perfect!I thought that this book was very amusing. I really enjoyed the setting, which transported me back to the Bay Area. I could picture the cities mentioned like Woodside, Palo Alto, and Menlo Park; the landmarks such as the Rosewood Hotel; even the street references like Sand Hill Road made me nostalgic for that area.The inside peek into the financial side of startups is fascinating, from IPOs to SEC filings to investor meetings, and how a single press release or rumor can cause a company's shares to skyrocket or plummet.I like the book but I didn't feel a connection with Sophia at first. I was expecting an immediate bond with her because we come from the same culture and grew up in the same area. The good news is that Sophia grew on me in the second half of the story. Her character development progressed and it endeared me to her. This book is based on Anna Yen's own experiences working in the tech world, and I couldn't help noticing that Sophia's boss Scott Kraft has an uncanny resemblance to Steve Jobs, and Andre Stark reminded me of Elon Musk.Overall, this was a quick, fun and light read, and a very enlightening story about Silicon Valley told by a strong, smart Asian woman."}, {"userName": "Dan Keefer", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40301777-dan-keefer", "userReview": "OK, so I was expecting something like the novelization of BROTOPIA BY EMILY CHANG . . .

She brushes elbows with innovators who are thinly disguised Gates and Jobs-like characters, but most of her time is spent with bankers, investors and middle managers who make her life difficult. When the book starts, Sophia has just graduated from a non-prestigious university. She still lives with her parents, something expected until a Chinese girl marries. Marriage is just one of the things she stresses about. She doesn't even have a boyfriend. Her parents are overly protective and offer her unwanted advice. She wants to have a place of her own yet but likes having to pay no rent while she begins her adult life.Sophia lacks confidence in her ability to score a decent, professional job as well as someone she can love who loves her back. But at the same time, she is a go-getter as well.This was not the sort of book I wanted to read. Well, that's what I thought. But Sophia is likable. You find yourself pulling for her to succeed and feel her pain when things go wrong. There is so much more to Sophia than daughter and employee, and her spirit is uplifting.On the downside, at some point I worried that the book was going to have a Hollywood ending.

However, I was very quickly bored and abandoned the book after the prologue and first chapter. The narrator was set up like a woman who had chanced into a relations position (read: nothing to do with tech) in tech after having a privileged upbringing. First of all, I find it really hard to relate to narrators who do not appear at least a little broken from the get-go, and the only problem Sophia seemed to have was shoes ruined in a puddle and overprotective rich parents. Second, if I wanted a look into the world of Silicon Valley from the outside, I would just keep watching the HBO sitcom (at least it has women in power and women coders). I had hoped for a narrative on how a woman made it in the field mostly ruled by men, but instead got a narrative about a woman kind of easing into the misogyny territory by serving as someone to soften the angles between the world and her bosses. And, most importantly, NOT EVEN DOING ANYTHING TECH-ADJACENT. I didn't have the patience to continue reading. It will probably be more interesting to read something on the history of women in tech, and wait for a coder/tech exec/guru woman novel to appear.

The men in the book are all terrible, with the possible exception of her second boyfriend who barely moved beyond a sketch of a person (as far as I got). Sophia is strangely obsessed with landing a husband in a way not a lot of Millennial women are (in my experience) so I was confused as to when this was supposed to take place. The paper-thin veil laid over Steve Jobs and Elon Musk in the guises of Scott and Andre was the most alarming part - if this is how they act(ed) in the workplace no wonder people burn out of Apple and Tesla at a rapid rate.In summary, finding out that the author was potentially the inspiration behind Edna Mode actually makes me dislike a character I'd loved."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6731814-michelle", "userReview": "(Audiobooks).

Anna Yen writes cleverly about what it\u2019s like to be a young professional woman in the 21st century, without over-dramatizing the sexism or misogyny, but being realistic about what women experience. I also appreciated how she told the whole story - we got snippets of Sophia\u2019s personal life, romance, family, health, career, emotions, things she was learning about herself, career choices, business details, etc. Because it was first person, we get a lot of Sophia\u2019s thoughts about why she makes the decisions she does and I thought they all rang true - I loved hearing her motivation for making the career moves she did. This wasn\u2019t just another story about someone trying to get ahead - it\u2019s a story about a woman learning about herself and understanding what it is about her that makes her so afraid of failure. It was funny, witty, and honestly read like a fascinating memoir. Would highly recommend for anyone, but especially young women or young professionals who want \u201cnew adult\u201d fiction that isn\u2019t angsty romance. Love love love!!"}, {"userName": "Catherine at The Gilmore Guide to Books", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1873196-catherine-at-the-gilmore-guide-to-books", "userReview": "In direct contrast to the hapless, helpless, dreary Elinor, Sophia Young is a dynamo. She is the force at the center of Anna Yen\u2019s debut novel, Sophia of Silicon Valley. She speaks her mind (sometimes too much), has an enviable work ethic, and dresses well to boot. So, she still lives at home, even though she has a good job and is twenty-five. Her parents are old-school Taiwanese and her diabetes makes them even protective of her. When her lack of filter gets her fired from a Silicon Valley investment bank, her momentum is hardly slowed at all. She networks until a friend gets her a paralegal job at a prestigious law firm which she parlays into a position as the head of investor relations for an animated movie studio about to go public. How far can she go in an industry dominated by testosterone?Yen completes a nice sleight of hand in Sophia of Silicon Valley. In the novel\u2019s first page Sophia shares that she works in such high-powered environments because it is\"A path to the white picket fence, two kids (preferably twins), and the Mrs. Homemaker lifestyle I\u2019d wanted ever since I could remember.\"The rest of this review is The Gilmore Guide to Books: https://wp.me/p2B7gG-2J5"}, {"userName": "Swan", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45200-swan", "userReview": "Breezy chick-lit. Maybe more of a 2.5 Star book. Basic plot is the life of a young Taiwanese American woman who gets catapulted into an Investor Relations role at a startup. Lots of not so subtle references to Steve Jobs and Elon Musk and the book is clearly based on the author\u2019s experiences at Pixar and Tesla. I appreciated the fact that the protagonist is a child of immigrants without having the typical poor immigrant story. Her dad heads up a medical device company , she lives in a big house with her parents and she drives a BMW. She uses her Asian-ness as an advantage at times but still deals with racist stereotypes. Those are all characteristics that I can relate to. However, I found the character\u2019s personality a little annoying and the last third of the book was pretty boring. IR isn\u2019t THAT interesting, at least not when you know what goes on behind the scenes."}, {"userName": "Courtney", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5008638-courtney", "userReview": "It was good; I would recommend it as a decent book but I wouldn't be screaming to people to buy it. Another review mentioned it still shows a woman in that \"fawning over the straight white man in power\" instead of just being a strong female role model. I think they're right - but i can imagine it's also tough to be able to write something like that and appeal to the masses... or at least people who read outside the Women's studies genre. I think I laughed out loud once or twice, but for the most part it was a light hearted read with some predictability in it. Woman is in relationship with wrong guy. Right guy shows up, woman finds way to end relationship. Guy still shows up at end of book and all love is right with the world."}], "description": "Sharp, dramatic, and full of insider dish, SOPHIA OF SILICON VALLEY is one woman\u2019s story of a career storming the corridors of geek power and living in the shadow of its outrageous cast of maestros.During the heady years of the tech boom, incorrigibly frank Sophia Young lucks into a job that puts her directly in the path of Scott Kraft, the eccentric CEO of Treehouse, a studio whose animated films are transforming movies forever. Overnight, Sophia becomes an unlikely nerd whisperer. Whether her success is due to dumb luck, savage assertiveness, insightful finesse (learned by dealing with her irrational Chinese immigrant mother), or a combination of all three, in her rarified position she finds she can truly shine.As Scott Kraft\u2019s right-hand woman, whip-smart Sophia is in the eye of the storm, sometimes floundering, sometimes nearly losing relationships and her health, but ultimately learning what it means to take charge of her own future the way the men around her do. But when engineer/inventor Andre Stark hires her to run his company\u2019s investor relations, Sophia discovers that the big paycheck and high-status career she\u2019s created for herself may not be worth living in the toxic environment of a boys-club gone bad.", "title": "Sophia of Silicon Valley", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35230483-sophia-of-silicon-valley", "average": 3.51, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1505768808l/35230483.jpg", "reviews": 64, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16820004.Anna_Yen", "name": "Anna Yen"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7382058.Tbd", "name": "Tbd"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Contemporary", "Womens Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35230483-sophia-of-silicon-valley", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35820392-sophia-of-silicon-valley", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35068733-sophia-of-silicon-valley", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38376062-sophia-of-silicon-valley", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35894346-sophia-of-silicon-valley"]}
