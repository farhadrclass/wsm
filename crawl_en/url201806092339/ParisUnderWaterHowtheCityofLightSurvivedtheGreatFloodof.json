Typically, I hate reading historically accurate books. They are just so. Dry. It is painful, really. And, if they are not painfully dry, I start to question their accuracy...and the author's intellect. This is not one of those books. I loved it. I feel so informed now!I had no idea that Paris flooded regularly. It makes perfect sense, considering the water level and elevation in question, I just never thought about it. Imagine my intrigue, then, when I found this book about a great flood in 1910. A flood so great that Parisians were refugees in their own city\u2014and yet this book is the definitive history, as per the introduction, because no one else has written extensively about it. This is marvelously researched and very readable, linking politics, social climate, and personal accounts in such a way that I could hardly put it down. And they even have photographs illustrating the depth and scope of the natural disaster.A brief timeline reduced from the appendix: Massive amounts of rain in northern France fall in the summer of 1909, making the normal swells of the Seine in the winter of 1909-1910 even more intense. Then the weather begins to warm a bit too quickly after the Christmas snow\u2014even the mountain snow\u2014melts in early January 1910.January 21\u2014The Seine begins to overflow and overextend its banks, but this is average-level flooding for the Seine.January 22\u2014The Seine extends into people\u2019s basements\u2014much to their chagrin. Metro lines come to a halt late at night because the air compression system is flooding, so the clocks stop. The sewers and underground channels are also pushing up water.January 23\u2014Now it\u2019s just ridiculous. The power plants are flooding so the metro lines begin to halt. The lights start going out.January 25\u2014The vinegar factory explodes after water and sensitive chemicals mix. Thousands of displaced Parisians invade the Red Cross shelters.January 27\u2014Soldiers arrive in boats from port cities to give aid. The city is almost devoid of light.January 28\u2014The Seine reaches its flooding peak: 20 feet above normal.January 29\u2014The Seine begins to recede.March\u2014The Seine finally returns to its normal level.You guys! It flooded almost overnight. And then it stayed flooded for a week...and then it went didn't go back to normal for over a month! That's just...insane.The water rose so quickly that reporters were dumbfounded. Imagine if you were on vacation that week and then came back to your house all ruined! \u201cThe water on the Champs-Elysees was already so deep in a few places that, according to press reports, at least one horse had drowned.\u201d And that was in the first few days of flooding!The Gare D\u2019Orsay, then a train station that is now the Musee D\u2019Orsay, was a favorite for photographers of the flood damage. \u201cAlthough the water was stagnant and foul, the reflection made the Orsay look like a beautiful ancient temple in ruins.\u201d The book includes one such photo, and let me tell you--awesome. The flooding had other surprises in store for man's modern city: \u201cIn the nearby Place de l\u2019Opera, the unfinished Metro station filled with so much water that the sidewalks aboveground began to wobble and then cave in and collapse, leaving ornate lampposts tilted at wild angles.\u201d How intriguing.I am so very glad that I read this lovely little snippet of often overlooked history."}, {"userName": "Autumn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2564574-autumn", "userReview": "I had no idea this event had happened\u2014and apparently, it was news to the author, too, until 2005 while he was on a tour of the Paris sewers and saw photographs depicting the flood of 1910. Clearly-written and well-detailed account of how Parisians responded to the rising of the Seine that, from Jan. 21\u201328 of 1910, was higher than it had been in over 250 years. It's almost eerie to see the familiar landmarks surrounded by water, and you feel the frantic desperation of the people as you realize that very little can stop the river once it starts rising. Something interesting about this account is the feeling of unity the flood created among the citizens\u2014including law enforcement, military, and government officials\u2014as they worked tirelessly together to rescue each other and their city. Jackson illustrates how this unity was a big change from the divisive sentiments felt a few years earlier during the Franco-Prussian war\u2014feelings that were still felt by some at the time\u2014and how it influenced the people's sense of solidarity which could be seen during WWI."}, {"userName": "Suzanne", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1787371-suzanne", "userReview": "This is a well-researched and very readable account of the catastrophic flood in Paris in 1910. It takes the reader through the day-by-day escalation of the waters of the Seine and the resulting destruction throughout Paris and surrounding towns. It explains how the sewers and underground train tunnels brought the flood further inland than it could have gone on its own. The main story, though, is how the Parisians, overall, pulled together to get through the disaster. Photos of the flooding are included, which are interesting to compare to current day photos from other sources to further appreciate the extent of the inundation. Fascinating."}, {"userName": "Margaret Sankey", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5861086-margaret-sankey", "userReview": "In January, 1910, torrential rains sent a flood of Seine water through Paris, including the newly-built sewer and Metro underground systems. For an urban population already dislocated by Hausmann's city reconstruction and profoundly distrustful of the police, Catholic Church, city and national government and the army, relief efforts and the social upheaval intrinsic to natural disaster reveal the fault lines of Belle Epoque France."}, {"userName": "John Weibull", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2923-john-weibull", "userReview": "This book was hard to put down. Mr. Jackson gives us a thoroughly researched book filled with fascinating anecdotes and tales of bravery under extreme circumstances.

If I wanted to read about natural disasters all I had to do was read the news: this is a week when Super Typhoon Hagupit displaced thousands of people in a mass evacuation and Brisbane is cleaning up after a super cell storm caused a damage bill of over $800 million, reviving memories of the 2011 floods when the Brisbane River burst its banks. Given that there are dozens of major cities around the world that are built on rivers, there have been countless major flood events for one reason or another, and historians could no doubt flood the market with stories about them all.But tourists love Paris, and so a book about their flood in 1910 was bound to be of interest. And so Paris Under Water appears to be, if you check the uncritical GoodReads ratings. But truth be told this is a rather dull book. It\u2019s well-researched (lots of footnotes &c) but badly written, with repetitive assertions and inadequate analysis. Once the initial fascination with the idea of Paris under water lapses, the book becomes a bit of a slog.To read the rest of my review please visithttp://anzlitlovers.com/2014/12/13/pa..."}, {"userName": "Alisa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2738978-alisa", "userReview": "Floods are scary. I am lucky to never have experienced one first hand and don't live in an area that is prone to such things. This flood occurred in the heart of a major European city and despite the lack of warning it is remarkable more people were not swept away. When the flood did come, the residents who survived used some good old ingenuity and resourcefulness to hold it together. The political backstory is insightful but not terribly dramatic. At the heart of it, a flood is my vision of the worst kind of massive sewage backup imaginable. The French love their bakeries and I give them a lot of credit for their clean up to get the city back up and running. And aren't we all glad! I sleep a little easier knowing they disinfected the place before turning the ovens back on. Overall this book was okay, but did not find it the riveting and inspiring survival story that one might expect (or that I expected) from a book about an unforeseen natural disaster. Well written, but reads more like a long newspaper article and a bit short on character narrative."}, {"userName": "Tim Robinson", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5932356-tim-robinson", "userReview": "And interest book from three perspectives. Firstly, a description of Paris in a decade when Paris was the most advanced city in the world. For instance, did you know that many factories, offices and even homes had compressed air piped in as a utility, like gas, water and electricity? Secondly, a description of the disaster itself. As the water rose, it not only displaced people but also crippled the advanced infrastructure (electricity, gas, telegraph lines, railways) that would be needed to coordinate and implement the relief work. But thirdly, a subtext of the flood as a cleansing moment in French history. Did it wash away the anger and humiliation of the Franco-Prussian war, the self-slaughter of 1871, and the shameful Dreyfus affair? Did it in some sense prepare France for the horrors and challenges of WWI?"}, {"userName": "Simone", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1484853-simone", "userReview": "Fascinating book. Also really well-paced throughly researched affair. The whole thing starts out with factors leading to the flood, and it reads just like a disaster movie where they establish exactly where everyone is and what they are doing as you know full well that disaster is going to strike. I only wish I had actually been to Paris before reading this, because I think it would make some of the geography he talks about more effective. But I had the general idea from pictures placed throughout. Anyway, it's not very long. On the whole I recommend it."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4846807-rachel", "userReview": "Read like a PhD thesis. Some parts were very interesting, but overall too \"tight\" a telling - a lot of repetition of activities through out the few days it covered. There's only so many ways you can say 'clean up continued' and keep it interesting. I would have enjoyed it with more specific-yet-varied stories and covering more days to to increase my enjoyment, but his afterword says not a lot of historical documents survived so I suppose he just didn't have the material to draw from.

As one of the few books written on the topic, the book speaks of the time leading up to the January 21-29, 1910 flood, including the importance of wars and disputes dating back forty or more years prior and ends it by brilliantly and smoothly connecting the devastating events to the outbreak and events of the German invasion of France in World War I (1914-1918).Needless to say, I give this book a five-star rating."}, {"userName": "CJ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54598-cj", "userReview": "This book was well-written and extremely informative, but also extremely dry.

Torrential rainfall saturated the soil, and faulty engineering created conditions that soon drowned Parisian streets, homes, businesses, and museums, thrusting the City of Light into a battle with the elements. Given the Parisians' history of deep-seated social, religious, and political strife, many worried that they wouldn't be able to collaborate to confront the crisis. Yet while the sewers, M\u00e9tro, and electricity failed around them, Parisians of all backgrounds rallied to save the city and one another. Improvising techniques to keep Paris functioning and braving the dangers of collapsing infrastructure and looters, leaders and residents alike answered the call to action.In breathtaking detail, Jeffrey Jackson captures here for the first time the epic story of the great flood. As the waters rise, so does the tension, but ultimately, the Parisians' love of their city leads them to triumph over nature against all odds.", "title": "Paris Under Water: How the City of Light Survived the Great Flood of 1910", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6625152-paris-under-water", "average": 3.73, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1312070863l/6625152.jpg", "reviews": 32, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/128504.Jeffrey_H_Jackson", "name": "Jeffrey H.
