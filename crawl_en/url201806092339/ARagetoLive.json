(Ret.)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2482609-captain-sir-roddy-r-n-ret", "userReview": "To my mind I am beginning to seriously consider the notion that John O'Hara is the American mid-20th century equivalent to Britain's Anthony Trollope of the 19th century. O'Hara was a prolific writer of short-stories, novellas, and novels from the late-1920s up until his death in 1970. He was incredibly adept at portraying all walks of life in the Pennsylvania coal country that he grew up in, or the streets and nightclubs of New York City, as well as on the film lots and studios of Hollywood. His real skill though, is his ability to describe and characterize the relationships between men and women.O'Hara's A Rage to Live, first published in 1949, is the story of the life of Grace Caldwell Tate. Grace is a woman of great wealth and great beauty, with an incredibly strong connection to the Pennsylvania Dutch landscape where she has lived her entire life. Not to put too fine a point on it, Grace likes sex, and this butts directly up against the rules that society places on the behavior of women in her day and time. There are consequences associated with Grace's choices and actions, and these consequences affect many of the citizens of the little town of Fort Penn where Grace lives with her husband Sidney Tate, and their three children.A Rage to Live is an enthralling portrait of small-town America just before, during, and following the First World War. This historical view of early 20th century Pennsylvania, as seen through the eyes of Grace and Sidney, was fascinating for me. O'Hara deftly describes the days of horses and wagons yielding to Model-T's, Ford Coupes, and Pierce Arrows; the patriotic fervor and fear of the on-coming World War in Europe; terrible diseases like influenza and \"infantile paralysis\" (i.e., polio myelitus) that indiscriminately strike rich and poor and old and young; the 'party-line' telephone system; and even the the arcane goings on at the local cocktail and dinner parties. There is even a brief little vignette where an older and mature Grace Caldwell Tate meets and chats up the young 17 or 18-year-old Julian English, long before he has married the pretty Caroline Walker, bought his Cadillac dealership, and later when at a party on a cold Christmas Eve--in a fit of pique--throws his highball and ice into the face of Harry Reilly, precipitating the events characterized in O'Hara's most famous novel, An Appointment in Samarra (1934).This was a hell of a good book that kept me turning one page after the other. I know that some reviewers have complained that it was too long, but I respectfully disagree, it was just right. In a sense this novel is the bildungsroman of Grace Caldwell, and it just wouldn't have made sense to only partially know Grace. No, the reader needs to know all of Grace, in order to better understand her \"Rage to Live.\"This novel is John O'Hara's 'A Portrait of a Lady'--Grace Caldwell Tate-and it merits 4.5 stars out of 5, and ends up being a truly classic work of modern American literature; and a novel that I guarantee you that I look forward to rereading again in the future."}, {"userName": "Debbie Gallaher Tarr", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8925555-debbie-gallaher-tarr", "userReview": "Interesting period piece information. 700+ pages. Whew. The title \"A Rage to Live\" gave me the impression it would be more intense. Instead, its kind of like a PG-13 Philadelphia Story. Not normally my type of book, but interesting writing style. Sometimes the author would spend 2 pages describing each and every person, say invited to a party, whether or not they were characters later in the book - it would go on and on and on, often making me want to skip to the end of the page. But then something major happens - a main character dies - and it's like the author lost steam, and such an important event begins and ends in the same paragraph, bringing me back to try to focus on EVERY paragraph, so I don't miss a major plot turn. It was odd, having every single food item from a buffet listed in great detail, pages, where you could almost taste the dishes, then the suffering of someone dying - is done and gone with before you know it, and you don't have a chance to feel it. I felt I knew the buffet dinner more than I knew the dying mans pain. A good book to read when you're sick in bed and need something you can pick up and read. Easy to put down, and easy to pick up."}, {"userName": "Paul Wilner", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/589019-paul-wilner", "userReview": "It's O'Hara, post \"Appointment in Samarra.'' When he's good, he's very very good and when he's bad he's awful. This one is a little bit of both - could have stood trimming by a hundred pages or two but I still far prefer him to the ever-priggish Brendan Gill, who famously demolished the book for The New Yorker, resulting in a lengthy O'Hara boycott of the magazine. Good on class differences, as usual; kind of an interesting portrayal of the main character, Grace Caldwell; given that it's a male writer trying to explain female experience, he does a better job than most of his contemporaries. Grace's husband, Sidney Tate, comes across as more of a paper figure, kind of like Leslie Howard as Ashley WIlkes. The author knows his rural Pennsylvania landscape, though."}, {"userName": "Sketchbook", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4708498-sketchbook", "userReview": "John O'Bloated."}, {"userName": "Nancy H", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1555231-nancy-h", "userReview": "This book has been on my To-Be-Read list for decades and I finally got to it. I really enjoyed it and I think it is an excellent slice-of-life novel from the early 20th century. It is set in the fictional town of Fort Penn, a thinly-disguised Harrisburg, the capital of Pennsylvania, which is very close to where I live. Many places and things were recognizable in the story, and I think it is probably a very fair representation of what life was like in that time period. The characteristics that make this a timeless story are that O'Hara shows people as they are, flaws and all, and he shows life as it really is, with its triumphs, tragedies, and its good and bad people and parts. There are many 'universal truths' scattered throughout the story, and most readers will be able to relate to the situations and the types of characters. The book is long, and in keeping with the literary style of the time, there are many descriptions, a literary technique which may put off some readers, but yet which add to the aura and atmosphere of the time."}, {"userName": "Terence Manleigh", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34734767-terence-manleigh", "userReview": "His Appointment in Samarra is just wonderful and he's credited with being one of the great short story writers of the 20th century, but O'Hara is simply dreadful here. I was astonished at how dull it is. There's something dispiriting about an obviously talented writer writing badly. O'Hara thought of A Rage to Live as his magnum opus, a grand social novel, but his envy and resentment towards the upper crust Pennsylvanians among whom he grew up leads to something like fetishism here. O'Hara cannot help but tell us every item on the menu at a society wedding, itemize every gift, tell us where it was purchased and at what cost, go into a lengthy analysis of how one's service at the local barber shop is determined by which country club one belongs to and why...I could go on and on. One keeps hoping O'Hara's incessant chronicling and categorizing of the banal will blossom into a story, but by page 255 (to be exact) I gave up. Oh, dear, what a very bad book."}, {"userName": "Tom Schulte", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5720805-tom-schulte", "userReview": "Ah, such excruciating detail on the small-town elite of imagined Fort Allen, PA! O'Hara deserves credit for this detailed setting, and I was surprised for the matter-of-fact and fairly explicit sex scenes of an early 60s book. Was O'Hara ahead of his time? Did the work get banned here and there?I thought from the movie Grace would be an unbridled nymphomaniac, more just someone that seemed damaged in a way and gave in to the expectation that she would \"put out\"... She seemed slightly tragic, her husband Sidney dying of a broken heart lamely so, and Richard Bannon like Greek tragedy.I thought the ending with documentary-style where-are-they-now of the key dramatis personae was weak and the book overlong and slow."}, {"userName": "Victoria", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/881991-victoria", "userReview": "The saga of Grace Caldwell, a socialite from a time when that meant setting standards of behavior rather than panty flashes falling out of a limo.

Perhaps that's because I've read so many long, family sagas that a woman's extra-marital affairs did not seem new and shocking, as they must have when the book was first published.

What we now think of as coal mines and rust belt was, from another perspective, a delicate Victorian society. Turning the pages of this 700 page paperback, I became frustrated with the hypocrisy of the characters and their society, so thoroughly described. The reprieve - or twist - comes in the postlude, in which we find the characters transposed into a different setting. There's the magic. Our minds eye now conditioned to the perspective of the genteel protagonists, we observe the capriciousness of our modern, liberal world."}, {"userName": "Patrick  O'Rourke", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24004725-patrick-o-rourke", "userReview": "This is a long and, on the face of it, somewhat lurid story of a randy woman. However, as with most of O'Hara, the real story is in the background with the decline of the Pottsville family. The Tates remain resistant to the changes in society around them, but these changes erode them anyway. This theme is personified in the character of Grace Tate. .
