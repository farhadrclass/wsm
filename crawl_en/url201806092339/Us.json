Me and you, growing old and dying together.''Douglas, who in their right mind would look forward to that?\u2019\u201dThis was the conversation moments after Douglas Petersen\u2019s wife rolls over in bed and informs him that she believes their marriage is finished. Their son Albie is a few weeks away from leaving for college and she \u201cwants to feel this is the beginning of something new, not the beginning of the end.\u201d For some people a conversation like this would not come as a surprise, there had been flashing red lights for years. For Douglas, who has enjoyed almost three decades of involvement with this woman, it comes out of the dark like a mugger\u2019s leather clad fist impacting the side of his jaw. Douglas is a man as stable and predictable as the sun and the moon. He is a biochemist studying among other things the genital architecture of the fruit fly. Maybe not exciting stuff to others, but being able to study evolutionary mutations in a few generations instead of waiting a millennium can be fascinating work. His wife Connie has an artist\u2019s soul. She is creative and used to sketch pictures of people before motherhood became all consuming. Albie shares her same passion for art, music, and photography. Douglas doesn\u2019t always understand their passions, but he does appreciate the intensity they have for their interests. It is the same way he feels about science. He loved Connie\u2019s sketches and when they buy their first house he offers to build her an artist\u2019s studio. David Nicholls moves us between the past and the present as Douglas relives their life together. One of the painful things to watch as this plot unfolds, is Douglas trying to support his wife\u2019s and son\u2019s interests only to somehow always say or do the wrong thing. Part of this is he is not \u201cright minded\u201d. They know this, so any attempt he makes to appreciate art the same way they do somehow diminishes their own enjoyment. If he likes a piece of art then it must not be any good. Connie springs this urge to\u201d discover herself\u201d on him just before they are to begin a family grand tour of Europe. Maybe not the best timing. He chooses to believe that she is only thinking about leaving him, that the jury is still out. The European vacation is one more chance for him to prove himself, to win the hand he most wants to hold for the rest of his life, one more time. Albie is the typical moody teenager who has become an expert at dividing and conquering his parents. Connie, always the protective hen about his artistic interests, is also the reliable counter weight to Douglas\u2019s attempts to pin Albie down on exactly what his plans are to become successful. There are two competing schools of thought on what success really means. To Connie it is pursuing your interests to the detriment of financial security. To Douglas it is to pursue a way to make a living and with spare time chase those artistic dreams. Neither system generally leads to happiness. The best chance anyone has of achieving any level of contentment is to find that tricky balance between financial stability and still manage to find ways to express themselves through a creative endeavor. For instance, a circulation manager in the Midwest might decide to write book reviews so he doesn\u2019t go fruit loops for cocoa puffs. I know it isn\u2019t as sexy as writing poetry, but it is a form of expression. So after hoisting this Sword of Damocles over Douglas\u2019s head Connie assures him that they must keep up appearances on this trip for Albie\u2019s sake. @*%#!Marriage has always been difficult, and with each new study the divorce rate is climbing all over the world. The divorce rate in the United States is estimated to be at 53%. Fortunately for Douglas he has better odds in Great Britain at 42%. Money is still the #1 reason for divorce, but I think the truth of the matter is that wrapped around any of the top reasons for divorce is the spectre of boredom. There is the seven year itch. Then the next big detriment to marriage is when the kids are finally scooted off to college, exactly the circumstances that Douglas is facing. People can not expect their spouse to make them happy. We are each responsible for our own happiness. Anyone is certainly gambling with bad odds thinking a new spouse will be the key to happiness. The divorce rate goes up exponentially with each new attempt. Third marriages have a 73% divorce rate. This all said, sometimes the spouse is the source of the unhappiness and the only resolution is divorce, but if we examine boredom as a main ingredient for divorce many might be mistaking comfort and dependability for tediousness. Douglas fits the trustworthy, no frills profile which might be considered dull especially if you have an artistic temperament. I have a feeling that Connie is not self-stimulating when it comes to producing art and that she needs someone or something to awaken those urges in her. Douglas can be as supportive as he wants to be, but he will never be a muse. Connie is perfectly happy with their marriage and sees it as a success. Douglas also sees their marriage as a success and doesn\u2019t understand why it can\u2019t continue. Last chance Douglas...the Petersen grand tour of Europe. Douglas tries to move into their artistic circle, but is met with skepticism and derision. He googles like a madman trying to find interesting facts to share. \u201dPerhaps this is why those museum audio-guides had become so popular; a reassuring voice in your ear, telling you what to think and feel. Look to your left, take note, please observe; how terrific it would be to carry that voice with you always, out of the museum and throughout all of life.\u201dWhen a family dispute has Albie running away from the grand tour Connie goes home, but Douglas decides that this may be the last chance he has to ever make things right with his son. David Nicholls follows up the phenomenally successful One Day with this amusing, but at times painfully real look at relationships between sons and fathers, between sons and mothers, and between wives and husbands. For those of you that have survived the teenage wars with your children, (I have recently graduated to survivor status.) depending on the part that you\u2019ve had to play, you very well may find yourself wanting to strangle/hug one or two of the characters in this book. You will experience a whirlwind tour through the Netherlands, France, Italy, with the grand finale occurring in Spain. To say the least, Douglas comes home a changed man, and though he isn\u2019t happy about the state of his marriage he is less fearful of the life that may exist after it.

I felt that my previous review did not do justice to the book.\nI was looking forward to us growing old together. Me and you, growing old and dying together.\n\nDouglas, who in their right mind would look forward to that?\nNow that is indeed a strong statement and how would you, as a spouse/partner, relate to that when your fifty-four year old husband, healthy, an academic and certainly not infirm makes that statement.I confess that I have never heard of this author at all. I was in Stansted Airport, London about ten days ago and I hate this airport with a passion. Why? It\u2019s the security as it takes forever. So arriving three hours in advance after staying at the Radisson at the airport when they ripped me off with a Caesar salad and a glass of white wine, the waiter actually wanted a gratuity, I was not in the mood for any nonsense. People, people everywhere. Living in rural France for nearly fourteen years, the idea of all these individuals being so close to me, so many different languages drove me to despair. Keep away from me! I like my space and my privacy.So W. H. Smith to the rescue. Well to me it was like entering into a sweet shop. Normally I don\u2019t find anything in there that I like but there was certainly choice on that particular day. I\u2019m a book addict and there is no getting away from it. I only wanted one book and ended up with six. But \u201cUS\u201d by David Nicholls caught my attention for several reasons. Firstly, it was the title, then the colour red on the cover, the fact that book was longlisted (why not shortlisted?) for the Man Booker Prize 2014, and I have a very good friend who is called Douglas but finally it was the blurb that clinched it for me!The novel is skillfully crafted and structured showing the current situation in relation to Connie\u2019s and Douglas\u2019 marriage and alternating with the twenty-first century version of the Grand Tour.With backdrops of England, France, Italy and Spain, the reader is taken through a kaleidoscopic narrative which is stunning. The descriptions of Paris and Florence with their art were also exceptional. Whenever I read a book and finally put it down, I always return to the part that leaves a lasting impression on me and this is when Douglas is in Barcelona and meets a smack of jellyfish (I had no idea what you call a group of jellyfish and this appears to be the appropriate definition \u2013 I guess they do \u201csmack\u201d in a way) whilst swimming in the sea. There are quite disastrous consequences here but gripping reading\u2026The novel is witty, humorous, soul-searching with tear-jerking sections, in fact a tragicomedy. Certain passages were indeed quite sad but I ended up laughing for some obscure reason.Just imagine, you are a middle aged man who has always loved his wife from the day he met her but regrettably for him, he did become a trifle complacent as seen in the book but he was totally unaware of this at the time.Their son Albie (also known as the \u201cEgg\u201d). Now, you tell me. Why would you call your son Egg? That\u2019s completely beyond me but then Egg plays a vital part in the breakdown of a marriage. Connie, to all intents a purposes does love her husband Douglas. I know that opposites supposedly attract but Connie being an arty type, who can indulge in light drugs is such an opposite to Douglas, a biochemist but then love works in wondrous ways as we all know and they marry, much to Douglas\u2019 amazement.The problem is the wretched son, Albie, who is planning to go to university to study photography and what follows is a wife who finally states that with the departure of their son to university, she will also leave Douglas after the three of them return from their planned Grand Tour. No date is given but the strain of all of this makes Douglas determined to maintain his relationship with his wife. But will he succeed?This is the most amazing odyssey of a man who wants to retain the love of his son and wife. It is truly wonderful, multi-faceted and I loved it. As for the ending? I was in a way disappointed but then\u2026 Well it\u2019s for you the reader to find out.The novel is witty, humorous, soul-searching with tear-jerking sections, in fact a tragicomedy. Certain passages were quite sad but I ended up laughing for some obscure reason.An absolutely wonderful book! Please read it! You will be, I\u2019m convinced, as entranced as I was."}, {"userName": "Anmiryam", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2490546-anmiryam", "userReview": "I approached this novel with some trepidation. True, it was selected for the Man Booker Prize Longlist, a prestigious honor to be sure, but in forums of readers who avidly follow the prize and try to consume the selected books, it was dismissed and denigrated. The snobbery arose from the aura left in the wake of Nicholls's previous bestseller, \"One Day\", which gave the book a miasma of being less than literary, a sop to populism on the prize list. I have to say, the jacket copy and blurbs from other bestselling writers reinforced that impression. Interesting -- what about this mainstream book destined for the bestseller list, and likely a movie adaptation, brought it to the attention of the Booker committee? It isn't the plot -- an awkward & conventional, but loving middle-aged white Englishman embarks on a trip around Europe to save his marriage and his relationship with his 17 year-old son. It isn't for literary daring -- Nicholls employs a single, reliable, first person narrative told in the past tense, to tell a story of mundane middle-class midlife transformation. No invented languages, no historical slight of hand or imagined dystopian future, or grand considerations of human nature. So what was it?Flawless execution.From the opening pages, Douglas's voice is engaging, warm and often funny. He is three-dimensional and alive, idiosyncratic and intelligent, able to provide insight into his motivations, but not always able to see a situation as others do. In short, he's as real a person you are likely to meet in the pages of a novel. Nicholls manages, despite the limitations of a single point of view, to give us glimpses into Connie and Albie's perspectives on Douglas -- no one is a villain here and the tragedy of this family arises from misunderstood actions and ineffective communication. As the story progresses, Douglas inches towards greater honesty and self-knowledge as he struggles to salvage his family. The lightly comic tone progressively shades darker as the secrets and tragedies of the Petersen marriage and Douglas's failures as a parent are laid bare. You cringe at many of Douglas's actions and you get the sense that the Douglas, describing the seriocomic pilgrimage sometime after the events, cringes as well. In some superficial ways \"Us\" resembles Emma Straub's \"The Vacationers\" -- a marriage on the brink, a child about to leave for college, a trip undertaken despite the stresses facing the family. In other respects it evokes Rachel Joyce's \"The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry\" which also made the Booker list back in 2012. Fear not, \"Us\" stands on its own despite these resonances and in my opinion is a more satisfying read than either.There are lots of other nice things I could say about \"Us\" -- it's a fabulous portrait of a marriage of opposites, a painful rendition of a father who wants to do well by his son, but can't seem to get it right, an effective use of different cities to set the mood -- but, the best I can really offer is to say, read this book when it comes out. I bet even if you don't think it deserves to be nominated for the Booker you will be surprised, impressed, engaged and entertained. As a bonus, if you care about such things, you'll discover near the end that Nicholls includes some nicely done nods to the construction of his fiction -- the stories that could have been instead of this one. It works, as so much else does in this charming and affecting novel.Booker Prize? I doubt it. Bestseller with many fans? Absolutely."}, {"userName": "Dianne", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2947323-dianne", "userReview": "I just finished reading this for a second time. I only do that with 5-star books and I am revising my rating accordingly. This book is wonderful!It's the story of a marriage in peril, narrated by the husband, Douglas. He is a British biochemist - a man who is ruled by logic and scientific reason. Douglas is improbably married to Connie, an artist, who is laissez faire to the extreme. Indeed, these two could not be more polar opposites. They have a seventeen-year old son, Albie, who is of his mother's temperament with a healthy disdain of all things conventional, including his father. When Connie announces to Douglas one night that she feels their marriage has run its course and she may want to leave, Douglas insists that the family stick to a previously planned Grand Tour of Europe where he secretly hopes to win his wife and son back.The story of the trip is interwoven brilliantly with the backstories of Douglas and Connie. Nicholls has done this masterfully - sometimes this technique can backfire and pull you out of the flow of the story, but not here. He is carefully stitching the tapestry of a marriage, of three lives.Douglas's narration is humorous, self-deprecating and occasionally heartbreaking. This book may seem like it would be a downer, but it is not. It's life - and ultimately, it's hopeful.Very well done - full of insight, wisdom and wry observations.

This is the sort of witty book that guys should read the moment their partners say, \u201cI\u2019m pregnant!\u201dOr maybe earlier.After 20 years of marriage, Douglas Petersen wakes up one night to hear his wife tell him, \u201cOur marriage has run its course. .\u2009.\u2009. I want to leave you.\u201dTo Douglas\u2019s surprise, his once attractive practicality has grown pinched and cold over the course of a long marriage. But in this irresistible novel, we see him from the conflicted inside: \u201cI loved my wife to a degree that I found impossible to express, and so rarely did,\u201d he tells us. \u201cI am 54 years old .\u2009.\u2009. and have one son, Albie, nicknamed \u2018Egg,\u2019 to whom I am devoted but who sometimes regards me with a pure and concentrated disdain, filling me with so much sadness and regret that I can barely speak.\u201dMore often, though, the trouble is that Douglas does speak. There\u2019s nothing about Albie that doesn\u2019t frustrate him. Tell me you haven\u2019t muttered this under your breath: \u201cHe refuses to wear a coat, an absurd affectation, as if coats were somehow \u2018square\u2019 or un-cool, as if there were something \u2018hip\u2019 about hypothermia. What is he rebelling against? Warmth? Comfort?\u201d And then there\u2019s the boy\u2019s room, \u201can immense Petri dish of furry toast crusts and lager tins and unthinkable socks that will one day have to be sealed off in concrete like Chernobyl.\u201d Douglas presents that most common tragedy of parenting: He would do anything for his child \u2014 except tolerate a little teenage attitude. \u201cI disapproved because I cared,\u201d he claims. \u201cWhy wasn\u2019t that apparent?\u201dDouglas tells us at the start, \u201cThis is a love story,\u201d but it\u2019s often a comedy and sometimes a tragedy. Trained as a scientist, Douglas knows everything about biology but little about life. Over the years, he\u2019s failed to understand just how alienated from him his wife and son have become. Determined to improve, he does what any well-organized scientist would do: He draws up a list. No. 3 states, \u201cIt is not necessary to be seen to be right about everything, even when that is the case.\u201d Ominously, No. 8 advises, \u201cMaintain a sense of fun and spontaneity.\u201dIn fact, Nicholls\u2019s entire novel comes to us as a long list of short, numbered sections \u2014 from one to 180. That super-organized structure, though, is no match for the messiness of family life. As any parent knows, there\u2019s no list a teenager can\u2019t scramble.Like Emma Straub\u2019s \u201cThe Vacationers,\u201d which came out earlier this year, \u201cUs\u201d is the story of a fractured family going on a trip: \u201cthe last summer holiday we\u2019ll have together.\u201d Despite her divorce plans, Douglas\u2019s wife imagines a Grand Tour to prepare their college-bound son for \u201cthe adult world, like in the 18th century.\u201d The young man, of course, would rather take the money and go off drinking with his buddies. To Douglas, who knows his marriage is over, this expensive expedition sounds like \u201ca funeral cortege, backpacking through Italy.\u201dNicholls is a delightfully funny writer with a huge audience in England \u2014 his most recent novel, \u201cOne Day,\u201d sold more than two million copies and was made into a film \u2014 and this over-planned vacation makes ripe material for comedy. If he were only a prig, Douglas would be an unbearable narrator, but he has a lovable, self-deprecating sense of humor, and he\u2019s as frustrated as anyone else with his inability to relax, to accept, to let it go. \u201cI reeked of disapproval,\u201d he confesses. And to all the usual pressures that travel is heir to, Douglas adds his determination to turn the Grand Tour into the Grand Cure: a summer so packed with good cheer that his wife will fall back in love with him and his son will realize just what a swell dad he has.If you\u2019ve ever left the house, you know that itinerary goes off the rails almost immediately. \u201cI did my best,\u201d Douglas says, \u201cbut my manner was queasy and self-conscious, like a children\u2019s entertainer who knows his act is failing.\u201d At their first stop in Paris, they check into a room \u201cthat was clearly the result of a wager to determine the smallest space into which a double mattress can fit. Brassy and vulgar, the bed frame must have been assembled inside like a ship in a bottle. On closer examination, it also seemed our room was a repository for all of Europe\u2019s spare pubic hair.\u201d The next room, which seemed perfectly lovely online, looks like a top-of-the-line bordello in a sex dungeon.Almost immediately, Douglas\u2019s efforts to win over his 17-year-old son are thwarted by the arrival of a sexy accordionist from New Zealand who majored in ventriloquism. Albie is smitten by this obnoxious young woman \u2014 who wouldn\u2019t be? On the worst nights, Douglas and his wife lie in bed trying to block out the sounds of \u201cPurple Rain\u201d while their son and his new girlfriend carry on next door.Yes, some of this has the madcap predictability of a rom-com available on DVD three weeks after its theatrical release. Douglas never tasted a hot chili sauce he won\u2019t accidentally rub into his eye. Showing off his strong swimming at the beach, he\u2019s surrounded by jellyfish (he imagines his corpse washing up on shore in an alarmingly tight bathing suit). But I found myself laughing \u2014 sometimes out loud on the Metro \u2014 through many of these antics. After a long season of novels focused on rape, torture and child abuse, \u201cUs\u201d felt like a welcome break.The real artistry of this book stems from its clever structure. Even as Douglas\u2019s doomed little family trudges around Europe, the narrative constantly shifts back 25 years to the beginning of his relationship with the attractive young artist who became his wife. She and her bohemian friends are so cool, and he\u2019s so square. \u201cI danced,\u201d he confesses, \u201clike someone wrestling with a bout of diarrhoea, clenched and anxious.\u201d He\u2019s overwhelmed by their differences but determined to impress her, to change, to do whatever he must to attract her. Before her first visit, he frantically redecorates \u2014 new postcards, new throw rugs, new underwear: \u201cIf she ever set foot in my flat, she would mistake me for someone else entirely; a bachelor of quiet good taste and simple needs, self-contained and self-assured, a man of the world who owned van Gogh prints and cushions and smelt of trees.\u201dThe story of how that excited young man became the panicked middle-aged husband desperate to save his family is the real voyage of this novel. For all its bad meals, lumpy mattresses and cramped train seats, \u201cUs\u201d evolves into a poignant consideration of how a marriage ages, how parents mess up and what survives despite all those challenges.This review was first published in The Washington Post:http://www.washingtonpost.com/enterta..."}, {"userName": "Gabriela Silva", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47631281-gabriela-silva", "userReview": "Was it the happiest day of our lives?

Into such a heart, when love steps in, the heart does not remain the same, ever. Finding your reflection in another being becomes a hypnotic revelation, empowering you at once, to ironically, surrender your many identities to live in the nurturing shadow of your beloved. You accept sans hesitation, you relinquish without regret, you pursue without fatigue and you transform without ado. And when this spring continues to brighten your heart for seasons together, you lose track of the weather outside. You care no longer to check the forecast of the world beyond yourself, which still bears the unpredictability of floating emotional clouds. Being in love feels almost like a trance that you hope would never run out of steam. But what if it does? A reticent 30-year old research scientist, Douglas Petersen, meets a vivacious 28-year old artist, Connie Moore. Buoyed and drained by different drugs in life, they find a common drug that leaves them high for the next 24 years: love. \n'...if only because the truly happy days tend not to involve so much organization, are rarely so public. The happy ones sneak up, unexpected.\"\nDuring this long springy hangover in London, they gain and lose much. Besides togetherness and loyalty, they gain a handsome, albeit recalcitrant son, Albie. He abates the loss of their beautiful daughter, Jane, to some extent. But when it is time for the 17-year old Albie to attend university, the family decides to undertake a Grand Europe Tour as a farewell gift to Albie. Corrosively for Douglas, it also doubles up as his final bid to win Connie back who, days before the commencement of the tour, shares her long-tended contemplation of pursuing a separate, individual life after Albie\u2019s departure.\n'There's a saying, cited in popular song, that if you love someone you must set them free. Well, that's just nonsense. If you love someone, you bind them to you with heavy metal chains.'\nAnd so begins a journey of epic proportions whose geographical vastness could only be countered by the stretch of emotional emptiness that Douglas had suddenly begun feeling like a lump in the rib. In the artistic corridors of Paris, on the cycling escapades of Munich, amidst the boisterous camaraderie of Amsterdam, over the splendorous rides of Venice and in the infectious effervescence of Madrid, he attempts to envelop his son in the friendship blanket by one hand while not losing grip on the love shield hoisted over his wife by the other. But are the attempts too little, too late?\n'The heat and humidity were Amazonian and rubbing the skin on my perspiring forehead produced a grey scurf like the debris from a pencil eraser, the accumulated grime of seven nations.'\nIs it possible to truly bask in an air of nostalgia if it does not leave the reassuring perfume of a loving present behind? How praiseworthy is a love that whisks away all our dreams because they find fulfillment in its refuge? Is wagering dreams for peace an act of cowardice? Should we pat our back if we receive eternal friendship in lieu of transient love? Who scores in the battle of unexpressed care and expressed scorn? Does communication, simply by its virtue of flowing, negate all its ill-effects? Nicholls swirls bubbles of profound thoughts towards us, which laced with witty humor, act as a mirror of life that laughs at us during our most sombre times; almost snatching control from our lives, like a perennial elder, whose children have suddenly developed the ephemeral hallucination of being their own bosses. But again, like an elder, it senses our flights and falls and without fail, opens another window of our heart. What comes in, of course, is a criss-cross of reflected and refracted rays which, although radiantly complicated, alleviate the darkness and give us a season, yet again, to see and live in a new light."}, {"userName": "Julie Christine", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1213607-julie-christine", "userReview": "There is something marvelously cathartic about Us. David Nicholls, graced by both Thalia and Melpomene, succeeds in making a tender salad out of raw satire. Humor, whether it\u2019s on the page or the screen, is so hard to do well. When it works, really truly works, we\u2019re wiping away tears of hilarity mingled with tears of sadness. Because what makes us laugh most deeply, what brings on that cathartic release, is comedy and tragedy sharing the stage. Douglas Petersen is in his early fifties and his wife, Connie, thinks she may want a divorce. She\u2019s not entirely certain, but at any rate, they have a long-planned trip to Europe with their teenaged son to get through, so let\u2019s take the summer and see how things go, shall we? Their son Albie, barely on speaking terms with his father for reasons anyone who has parented a teenager or who has ever been a teenager will understand (namely, that the loathed parent exists), balks at spending several weeks schlepping around the Continent with his parents. He agrees to go only out of adoration for his mother. They are, as Douglas explains, a \u201csmall family, somewhat meagre, and I think we each of us feel sometimes that it is a little too small, and each wish there was someone else there to absorb some of the blows.\u201d Douglas determines that this Grand Tour of Europe is his chance to make his wife fall in love with him all over again and to close the rift with his son. It is the simplest of premises: how one man tries to save his small but splintered family. It doesn\u2019t even sound all that interesting, really. Oh, but I couldn\u2019t put this down. I didn\u2019t want to put it down. And I laughed and cried all the way through. I confess I\u2019d never heard of David Nicholls, despite his wildly popular novel One Day (2009) and being a huge fan of the movie Starter for 10, which I learned is a Nicholls\u2019 novel and a screenplay he wrote. I plan to catch up if his other novels are as deeply satisfying as Us. The story is structured as a series of present moments punctuated by the past, recounted by Douglas, a methodical, staid, and unprepossessing scientist who once devoted his research to the genetic structure of the fruit fly. How he managed to enthrall and hang onto Connie, a blithe spirit, a moody, beautiful artiste, is revealed in self-conscious wonder and tenderness by her still-smitten husband. It would be easy to feel exasperation and pity for a man whose son regards him with such sullen disdain and whose wife trifles with their twenty-year marriage, but Douglas is never mawkish. Bewildered, yes, but his fumbling determination is endearing and empathetic. And, for heaven\u2019s sake, the unraveling of the trip is just so very funny. Nicholls injects a series of slapstick events into the Petersen\u2019s traipsing through Europe, but the comedy routine is always tinged with Douglas\u2019 own sadness and anticipation: will he save his marriage or not?The adventure takes on a breathless singularity when Albie, in a fit of pique over an unintended insult by his father, abandons his parents in Amsterdam and disappears with a peripatetic busker from New Zealand. Connie decides the trip is over for her, too, and returns to England. At the eleventh hour, Douglas realizes this is his chance to be a hero to his wife: he decides to stay on in Europe, find his son and make things right. What ensues is a comedy of errors that lands him in jail, in the middle of a school of stinging jellyfish, and in the arms of a sympathetic Scandinavian divorcee. How it all comes together, or falls apart at the end, you really must discover for yourself. At its heart\u2014and it\u2019s such a very big heart, indeed\u2014Us is the portrait of a marriage, one that will be very familiar to those of us who\u2019ve spent at least half our lives as part of an Us, and perhaps a cautionary tale for those who have not. It is all the taking for granted, the piling up of misdemeanors large and small, the loss of joy in the drudgery of day to day rolled up into a one-sided love story and the coming-of-age of a husband and father. Poignant and hilarious, Us is also hopeful, awkward, darling, and full of joy."}, {"userName": "Larry H", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5872506-larry-h", "userReview": "Douglas Petersen is a mild-mannered biochemist in his early 50s. He craves order and although he thinks he has a good sense of humor and the ability to enjoy himself, he isn't one to loosen his inhibitions frequently, or give up plans for spontaneity. He and his wife, Connie, have a son, Albie, who is planning to go to college once the summer ends. And then one night, Douglas' life is upended when Connie awakens him.\"I said I think our marriage has run its course. Douglas, I think I want to leave you.\"Connie's declaration throws Douglas completely for a loop. But she isn't ready to make a definitive decision on their marriage just yet. They had planned to take Albie on a European tour over the summer (which they nicknamed \"The Grand Tour\") in an effort to show him some of the world's greatest art, architecture, and history. Douglas has the entire trip planned down to the minute. Connie still wants to go on the trip, and not reveal their discussions to Albie, and when they return from their travels, she'll make a decision.\"To contemplate a life without her; I found it inconceivable. Literally so. I was not able to conceive of it. And so I decided that it could not be allowed to happen.\"Douglas is determined to save his marriage, and approaches their trip with utter gusto. But Douglas' need to keep everyone on schedule, his obsessive reading travel and art history books and regurgitating the information at will, and his desire for order exacerbates many of the couple's problems, not to mention furthers the tension between him and Albie, whom Douglas believes has always favored his mother. And although they all try (Connie and Douglas more than Albie) to keep on trying, it isn't long before everything goes horribly awry.Us is the story of a man always in control who finds a situation he cannot control\u2014and one he cares about more than everything. He wants to prove to Connie that she shouldn't give up on their relationship, and he is determined to try to salvage his relationship with his son. But can a person really change their nature? Can the issues that have arisen throughout a relationship suddenly disappear?The book switches between past and present, with Douglas chronicling The Grand Tour and the events they encounter, as well as reminiscing about their relationship from the start, when the two wholly different people met and charmed each other into eventually building a life together. Douglas certainly sees the tensions and issues that have occurred through the years, but for a man who is so intelligent, he isn't particularly observant or attuned to his emotions or others'.David Nicholls' One Day was one of the best books I read in 2010, and the movie was one of my favorites as well. Needless to say, I was eagerly anticipating this book, but sadly, I found myself really disappointed. I thought the book went on for far too long and just kept repeating the same themes\u2014Douglas cannot be spontaneous, Connie is frustrated by this, Douglas gets upset with Albie, etc. Even certain incidents in the plot seemed straight out of central casting\u2014saying the wrong things when attempting to speak a foreign language, getting stoned in Amsterdam and running into prostitutes, etc.But the biggest problem I had with Us was that the book was narrated by Douglas, and I didn't really like his character very much. Sure, he's self-deprecating, and knows what his shortcomings are, but I didn't find him particularly sympathetic\u2014in fact, I didn't love any of the characters.

After being told his wife wants to leave him, she talks him into going on their planned trip with their son albie. I tried to picture myself or my husband going off on a major holiday after this type of discussion and just couldn't. We have been married many years, just as Douglas and Connie in the book, and both of us would be so devastated we probably would not be emotionally functional.Yet, the story is an engaging one, well written for sure. Never took to the character of Connie, thought her selfish though she maintains she still loved Douglas. A good look though at a marriage where one spouse wants something different than the other. So a good read if one can suspend belief, or maybe their are marriages and people out there who can put side their thoughts and emotions to go through something lime this.

But as a whole, \n  Us\n was a self-indulgent, teeth grinder of a book. The main character was a mess, and rightly so, because his wife and son's characters were pretty much the scum of the earth.I have never felt more inclined to throw a book at my wall, with hopes of actually injuring a few choice characters within. \n  Us\n was a portrayal of the shining moments of love, and the darkened moments of it's decline. Douglas Petersen is on the verge of losing his wife, but for no good reason, in my opinion. Connie Petersen wakes up in the middle of one night with the courage to utter some despairing words: \"...\n  I think our marriage has run it's course. Douglas, I think I want to leave you.\n\" What ensues is a maddening switch of timelines between present, and past.\u00a0Present: Douglas, Connie and their son Albie have gone on their pre-booked Grand Tour of Europe, despite Connie's statement, but to the inner joy of Douglas. He hopes to win his wife back, and finally gain some respect from his son while he's at it.Past: Douglas recounts his unexpected love affair with Connie-starting from before they even met. When they do meet, there couldn't be less fanfare, and more effort on Douglas's part to convince us that what he and Connie shared up until a certain point was pure, and utter, magic.I was having none of it, and maybe that was Nicholl's intention. The story was Douglas's perspective, his view on what he thought the people around him were feeling, and expressing. I would have loved to have Connie's side of the story, happening simultaneously with her husband's. I wanted to know the thoughts of a woman that I only grew to hate more and more as the narrative progressed-Connie was selfish, dissatisfied, and wholly unlikable. I feel as though we were sometimes meant to see Douglas as the enemy, but personally, I wanted to shelter him the entire time. I wanted him to know that he was doing a fantastic job of being a father, and keeping his family provided for. I wanted the whole book to turn into a big \"finding yourself\" for him. I wanted Connie and Albie to take their self-centered selves into some other book, somewhere else.\u00a0Nicholl's writing was thought-provoking, the multiple lines I highlighted was proof of that. There were profound statements that spoke to me about my own state of affairs, made words out of thoughts I have never verbalized. \n  Us\n definitely was a subjective novel, laid out in a way that allows readers to see themselves in either Douglas or Connie, or even Albie.

I kept thinking \u201cNO, Douglas! Don\u2019t SAY that! Just stop! ARGH$#!\u201dBut that\u2019s the point. Connie loves Douglas in spite of his obsessive nagging and worrying, which is nothing like that of her arty-party London friends. She\u2019s pretty and popular, he\u2019s nerdy and not. Miss Extrovert, meet Mr Asperger. But he\u2019s smart and can make a battery out of a lemon! He tells us compared to his A4 sheet of past relationships, she has a three-drawer filing cabinet. Douglas tells their story in pieces, following their Grand Tour of Europe while reminiscing about the last 25 years. It\u2019s a tale of love and friendship, and how they learned to accommodate each other as the bumped along through successes and over tragedies.\u201cConnie was, in those days, ferociously untidy. . .it was not unusual for her to reach into the pocket of a capacious coat for keys and to pull out a small wrench, a stolen ashtray, a desiccated apple-core or the stone of a mango. . .But, for the most part, I didn\u2019t mind. Light travels differently in a room that contains another person; it reflects and refracts so that even when she was silent or sleeping I knew that she was there.\u201dNow Douglas is intent on ensuring 17-year-old son Albie is prepared for every worst-case scenario in an uncertain future world by bullying him over homework day in and day out and belittling his choice of photography over science (sure, that\u2019ll help). Meanwhile, Albie would rather wing it, like Mum.Connie tells Douglas she might want to split up soon, but first, she wants the three of them to do the Grand Tour. Douglas, grasping for this lifeline (maybe he can win her back!), goes overboard, printing up detailed itineraries with everything scheduled, pre-booked, and pre-paid, with stops at all the major art museums for his arty family. On the trip, feeling his father is ashamed of him, Albie finally rebels and takes off with a wild accordion player for countries unknown.Connie returns to England, while Douglas feels compelled to repair the damage and track his son down and fetch him home to his mother.There\u2019s a wealth of love and tenderness between them, and Connie has always seemed to understand the words that Douglas hasn\u2019t been able to bring himself to say, although Douglas is now starting to doubt it. \u201c\u2026my wife at fifty-two years old seems to me as attractive as the day I first met her.

No one prefers wrinkles, no one prefers grey.\u2019 To which I\u2019d reply, \u2018But none of this is a surprise. I\u2019ve been expecting to watch you grow older ever since we met. Why should it trouble me? It\u2019s the face itself that I love, not that face at twenty-eight or thirty-four or forty-three. It\u2019s that face.\u2019Perhaps she would have liked to hear this but I had never got around to saying it out loud. I had always presumed there would be time and now, sitting on the edge of the bed at four a.m., no longer listening out for burglars, it seemed that it might be too late.\u201dIt\u2019s interesting to watch Douglas and Albie grow up on their big tour, and I can see why this was longlisted for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.

This will be their last tour together as a whole family, and to educate, prepare Albie for his departure. However, at 4am one morning Connie drops a bombshell; she tells Douglas she can\u2019t see the rest of her life with him, once Albie is gone, and is thinking of a divorce. But they\u2019ve both agreed for Albie sake, they should continue with the \u2018Grand Tour\u2019, as planned.US is narrated by Douglas as they journey across Europe, who believes he will win back the heart of his wife and to restore the gap between his son by his meticulously planned trip. But the harder he tried, the worse it got; accidently booking an undesirable hotel in Amsterdam, being stung by jellyfish in Barcelona, a run in with irate bikers, and generalLY saying wrong things that would get up Connie\u2019s nose, and would ultimately drive his son away to travel with an accordion busker. At the beginning of US, I couldn\u2019t understand why Connie would want to leave this him. Douglas seemed like a decent man, and in his own awkwardness, he does make Connie laugh. I thought her reason to \u2018rediscover herself\u2019 was a bit selfish. Why couldn\u2019t she do it with Douglas?Through alternative chapters, Douglas reminisces of the time they first met and the years that follow. Douglas is biochemist, and what I\u2019d describe as plain, straight-laced type of guy, a bit pedantic and likes order. Whereas Connie is the artistic type, spontaneous and free spirited in nature but beautiful lady - and Albie\u2019s inherited Connie\u2019s free spirited nature. Even though they are poles apart, Connie found these traits in Douglas so appealing, and they clicked. It wasn\u2019t until the later parts of their marriage, when they came together to make important decision - such as parenting issue, job security and home relocation - that their differing values collided; and that included Douglas relationship with his son. The entire family dynamics felt so draining for all parties, and I could see where Connie was coming from. US is a simple story and while it\u2019s hilarious at times it did give my heart a gentle tug.

Non ho ben chiaro perch\u00e9 tutto ci\u00f2 che \u00e8 nostalgico mi attragga come un magnete. Nicholls come altri scrittori stigmatizza la nostalgia dopo avervi tuffato i frollini a colazionePerfino i festeggiamenti avevano un che di lugubre: i veneziani trovavano spiritoso mascherarsi da scheletri, forse un retaggio delle antiche epidemie\u2026 Saranno stati il silenzio e le ombre, i canali scuri o l'assenza di verde, ma in quelle viuzze deserte, in quelle piazze battute dalla pioggia venivo colto da una malinconia stranamente soffusa di piacere. Non mi ero mai sentito cos\u00ec triste e allo stesso tempo cos\u00ec felice in vita mia. Victor Hugo scrisse che la malinconia \u00e8 la gioia di essere tristi. A Nicholls replico che la nostalgia che lui definisce assolutamente inutile \u00e8 la fonte d\u2019energia primaria di ogni romanziere, una fonte non rinnovabile, petrolio, non vento.

But then, when he tells the story in flashbacks, things were never great; they were always horrible and awkward. He hates her friends, her lifestyle, her family, her books, her music and the list is endless. The book itself reminds me of certain other things, like Burton and Taylor in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, and Taylor's depiction of the mad harpy. Also, with all the navel gazing, I was reminded of Tony Parsons' book Man and Wife. Is Nicholls aware of these things when he's writing?There are the usual contrived Nicholls' scenes of embarrassment: sunburn on one side of your face, a middle aged man wearing ridiculous clothes - don't ask - getting arrested in Italy, stung by jellyfish, eating red hot chilis and making a scene in a restaurant, etc, etc. And of course it all happens to Douglas, not the perfect Connie.Things do happen to people, just not in the ways described by the author.I've tried several books now and I am bored by the style and the repetition.I only stuck with this book because I wanted to see if he mentioned any of the places that I'd been to in Italy.

His writing is absolutely, brilliantly, very British-ly perfect, so many passages vacillating between comedy and heartbreak, characters trying to communicate and often misunderstood. The main protagonist Douglas, while a scientist, has an offbeat way of looking at the world with insights that are metaphorically creative and laugh out loud hilarious:\u2018I was wary because parties, and dinner parties in particular, had always seemed to be a pitiless form of gladiatorial combat, with laurel garlands bestowed to the most witty, successful and attractive, and the corpses of the defeated lying bleeding on the painted floorboards.\u2019Beyond the writing, this is as realistic a portrayal of a family as I\u2019ve read in a while: people who love each other, but sometimes don\u2019t like each other. Each character is expertly drawn in all of their flawed and maddening splendor, yet each is eminently likable in their individuality.'There's a saying, cited in popular song, that if you love someone you must set them free. Well, that's just nonsense. If you love someone, you bind them to you with heavy metal chains.'And I love that Nicholls didn\u2019t go for the wrapped-up ending with the big bow, years of conflict and discord suddenly forgotten and instead gives us truth and, in that, beauty, even if it isn\u2019t always as we\u2019d hoped for or imagined.

Plus, he's a teenager, so he's got that not going for him.Everyone annoys each other here, and they all ganged up to annoy me as a reader.Now, Nicholls also wrote One Day, a heartbreaking, interestingly formatted novel about two people who just can't stay apart. It was made into a meh movie with Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess (that guy from Across the Universe). Nicholls was great with that one.And in this one...I hated everyone. Which bums me out to say, but...every single one of the Petersons is awful. At first I thought it was just Connie and Albie. They were downright terrible to Douglas! And they were pretty awful people. I could give a little leeway to Albie because he was a Teenage Character going through a \"Phase\" (you know, the stereotypical one where one hates ones parents, although in this case he only really hates Douglas). But Connie...she looks down on her husband with derision throughout the entire novel. Any expression of affection is done in a pitying way. Even during flashbacks, where we supposedly see the days they were the most happiest, she's a stuck up woman who thinks Douglas is merely cute and clever. Whereas Douglas is just besotted, and perpetually in a can't-believe-a-woman-this-beautiful-could-be-into-me state of mind.When Douglas messes up, Connie and Albie join in on shaking their heads, locking their doors, shutting him out. At no point in the novel did I sympathize with either of them. Why would Douglas want to keep these kind of poisonous relationships around, is what I actually thought at one point. Bad, I know.And then I didn't like Douglas. Because he's just so darn affable. He wants so very badly to make this all right (when he's done actually very little to deserve such derision), that he steps over the line of sympathy. At just the moment I was about to give up on him (and, perhaps, the book), he does start to build up a spine. He rallies. He goes after something. Which had me cheering for him again. Okay, I thought. I could get behind this character. I could want him to be happy again, even if its with these nasty people. But even that's not enough. Because Douglas is like a sad puppy. And when someone shows that they don't like him again, he goes back to being a doormat. The ending is a sad, flat note on a family that already had a dismal outlook."}, {"userName": "Algernon", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4728718-algernon", "userReview": "[ as in killing the first child of the couple and by giving Douglas a chance at redemption simply as a result of having a near fatal heart attack.

A journey that begins when outgoing, artistic Connie meets the slightly awkward, conservative Douglas at a party. He ends up walking her home and they spend all night talking to each other. Connie finds she enjoys his company and the stability and caring in their relationship, something missing from her previous relationship with a tempestuous artist. Their marriage survives 25y and it is as their son Albie is about to leave home for University that Connie tells Douglas the marriage is over and she wants to make a fresh start to 'rediscover herself'. Douglas, unaware that their marriage had run out of steam wants to continue with their plans for one last holiday together as a family, a 'grand tour' of the art galleries of Europe.This is another excellent book from David Nicholls. He is so very good at getting inside the heads of his characters, whether it is the artistic, slightly boho Connie or the somewhat aspergerish Douglas or the emerging young adult Albie trying to forge his own identity. The grand tour of course does not go well. These are three conflicting personalities that should never plan to travel together. Albie would rather be in Ibiza partying with his friends (as would any school leaver). Douglas lacks confidence in his ability to appreciate great art, trying too hard to please Connie and Albie by reading up on the famous paintings they are to see and then spoiling everyone's enjoyment by reciting facts. However, when the tour falls apart they must all face their feelings for each other and redefine their relationships."}, {"userName": "Susan Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5172713-susan-johnson", "userReview": "Us tells the story of a disintegration of the twenty five year marriage of Douglas and Connie. There are no major blow ups but it is a just a relationship that it is worn out. There is not enough passion to be angry but Douglas is resisting the break up. He still loves his wife. They decide to still do their month long tour with their 17 year old son, Albie, touring Europe from one corner to another. Douglas is hoping to rekindle the romance and Connie, frankly, just seems to want to travel with their little family one more time. Albie, like all teen-agers ready for college, wants to go by himself. He very grudgingly goes along. For an American the European tour is just breathtaking. I just can't wrap my mind around how easy it is to travel in Europe. In four hours they have been flying over many countries. In four hours I can't even get out of California in any direction. I love the train travel stories and just the ease of getting around.  Douglas is a scientist and quite smug about it. He can not imagine anyone wanting to do anything else. When Albie decides he wants to be a photographer, Douglas is appalled. He tells his son anyone can do that. It's only a select few that can be a scientist and make a real difference. I thought who would be that insensitive? Then I realized that Douglas is a real life Sheldon Cooper from \"The Big Bang Theory.\" He has the same traits as Sheldon in not knowing how he sounds to other people, his amazement that anybody would want to be anything but him and his inability to pick up cues from other people.In one episode Douglas creates a Lego sculpture then glues it so Albie can not destroy it. He is sure he will be greeted with applause and great awe. Instead Albie cries because he can no longer use his Legos. Douglas is bewildered and I could see this scene on \"Big Bang\". Needless to say Douglas and Albie have a troubled relationship and how things unfold create new stresses. It's that exploration of how to repair things that is quite interesting. None of the characters are particularly likable. Douglas is Sheldon Cooper, Connie often mocks him and helps wedge some dislike between father and son, and Albie, like most 17 year olds feels he is quite entitled.  By the end of the book, I was glad I had met them but I was very tired of them. It was just like I had spent a month with family travelling around Europe."}, {"userName": "Ylenia", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23901024-ylenia", "userReview": "\u2605 2016 AtY Reading Challenge \u2605: A book with a beautiful cover.This book would be shit if it wasn't for the writing style.

Well, actually, she decides, and reveals her intention to him on the first page of the novel. The idea is that they spend a last family holiday together, the two of them and their teenage son, and see where it takes them. There are two things about this book which strike me, the first one is more tongue-in-cheek, but the second one is a more serious observation.Here's the first one. To understand what I mean, you need to know a little bit more about the main characters - no spoilers, just the bare bones of it. Connie is married to Douglas. Connie is an avant-garde, hip artist with all the young and rebellious character traits you would expect. Douglas is a scientist.The twist about that last family holiday they are about to take is that Connie decides to model it after the \"Grand Tour\", that educational rite of passage fashionable amongst young aristocrats in the 17th and 18th Centuries. And in those centuries, the educational value was seen mainly in an exposure to the culture of classical antiquity and the renaissance.So here is what struck me about this. I can see why a recreation of the Grand Tour would appeal to an artist. But would a young, hip art-lover not adapt the Grand Tour to the modern day? I should have thought so. But no. Connie pretty much aims to imitate what the old duffers three centuries ago have done, and not until the final chapter of the book do the characters so much as glance at a painting created later than the 16th Century. In Munich, for example, they are taking in huge details of Pieter Bruegel's paintings, but never stop to look at exhibits by Franz Marc, August Macke, Otto Dix, George Grosz and countless others I could name? Really?And here's the second one. I really liked this book. And this is quite surprising, actually. Because typically, I would get bored with books that are obviously \"about\" something. But I did not get bored with this one. And, let's face it, on the surface of it, this is not a brilliant story - a marriage runs into difficulty, and they're trying to see whether they need to split up, or not. Hardly original, hardly something that has not been done millions of times before.But here is what makes this book special: It wears its serious theme lightly. David is writing with wit and charm, but remains psychologically astute and penetratingly observant to the end. And he does so often with just a few words, which nonetheless manage to capture a whole paragraph of subtext. Here are two examples from a passage where the I-narrator characterises his son:\"... girls feel drawn to him, feel they can 'really talk' to him...\" (p47).\"He is 'not a natural academic', according to his college tutor, 'but he has wonderful emotional intelligence ...\"(p48).The beauty of these phrases is that people really do use them. And I think we all know what they really mean. So I wont spell it out.And I also loved it because I thought David chose a clever narrative mode. The \"I-narrator\" never allows the reader to escape from the subjective account of Douglas, and continues to present the tale entirely from his point of view. But although this is the case, we get to know David pretty well during the course of 400 pages. The discussions with Connie and their son may be given from the perspective of the I-narrator, but they clearly illustrate Douglas' personality, and allow the reader to make up his own mind.And hence, as the story draws to a close, it becomes more and more obvious that this is not really a story about a married couple so much as it is a story about Douglas.Highly enjoyable - a rare book that talks about a serious topic in a light-hearted manner, and yet remains psychologically insightful at all times."}, {"userName": "Ken", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/730754-ken", "userReview": "Episodic. In fact, to the point where author David Nicholls numbers the episodes for readers (for you number wonks, it comes to 180). This domestic month-in-the-life is about a British family of three -- scientist hubby Douglas Petersen, his Bohemian wife Connie, and their typically-moody teen son, Albie. Connie has announced she's thinking about divorce, and Doug puts all his hopes in the Petersen family's upcoming \"Grand Tour of Europe.\" Can you see disaster coming? Of course you can! Sooner rather than later, too.Let's start with the quibbles. The book reads like it was written with the movies in mind. Maybe that's not a negative in many readers' minds, but it always throws me a bit if I'm distracted from the words, the craftsmanship, and the moment by niggling notions like, \"Oh, I could see THAT scene on the big screen\" or, \"I'll bet they'll cast so and so as Connie. She'd be perfect!\" and so on.You see, many of the \"episodes\" are set pieces. And the writing can be, at times, self-consciously clever. Put it together and you get a novel crying for a director. They won't need a screenwriter because Nicholls already has experience -- he wrote the screenplay to his last book, ONE DAY. In 2010, it became a Jim Sturgess/Anne Hathaway vehicle (as they say).To be fair, though, there's a lot to like here. By making Douglas such a square, such a killjoy, and such an annoyed dad, Nicholls is able to mine quite a few funny situations, especially with the more worldly Connie as a foil. Visiting the big cities of Europe (chiefly for the museums) gives it all an \"If It's Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium\" feel, too. Rushing for trains. Discovering disastrous lodgings. Arguing over petty things because... well, because everyone's hot and bothered and too close for comfort.As the plot thickens and the marriage teeters, Nicholls develops alternate narrative lines by mixing flashbacks detailing Connie and Doug's early relationship with the present-day melodrama. And while I found myself a tad impatient with the threads about the past, in the end they added some depth to the drama playing out in the present.Can it get cute at times, too clever for its own good, even over-the-top in a few scenes? Well, yeah. But it's enjoyable. And, dare I admit, heartwarming in its way. Meaning? I just KNOW that Hollywood audiences will love it and that the right actors will milk it for all its worth when the cows come home and the box office opens. Four hundred pages, but a quick read and a fun read. If you like that sort of breezy, family tragicomedy thing, it appears you've found your book.Comment"}, {"userName": "Emma Flanagan", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30481036-emma-flanagan", "userReview": "My rating of this is probably a bit unfair. For my own personal reasons I never connected with the story and never enjoyed it. I found it work. However it is well written. Nicholls creates characters which are extremely realistic if not likeable. You'll never find yourself rooting for any of them. Nicholls has a brilliant understanding of humanity, of people, with all their flaws. He shows in a realistic manner what it's like when relationships break down, be it a relationship between two partners or that between a parent and child. He pulls few punches in showing the grim reality of how these things can happen, and that live doesn't always end happily ever after.Yet for all that, and notwithstanding my own personal reasons for not enjoying it, it is nowhere near the level of One Day. There's a touch of the difficult second album about it. There's that sense that yes there are some good points, but overall it just doesn't quite work. Maybe it's the fact the characters are all so unlikeable. Let's face it even with an anti-hero/heroine we still want to cheer for someone. Maybe it's the idea that anyone would willing agree to go on a long holiday with the person who has just informed them they are leaving them after it. I mean such a thing can only end well! Won't be stressful at all! Whatever it is, something just isn't there. That magic! That spark! That something you find in truly brilliant books! Is it worth reading? Probably, if you want an easy read which is at least relatively well written. Is it a book that will stay with you? No. I'll have forgotten it by tomorrow. Hell I'll have forgotten it in an hour."}], "description": "Douglas Petersen may be mild-mannered, but behind his reserve lies a sense of humor that, against all odds, seduces beautiful Connie into a second date and eventually into marriage.
