Let's see if I get this... A Colonel wrote a book about a social phenomenon using scientific data? Seems legit enough in my opinion. I haven't read this because over the years I've read hundreds of scientific articles about violence and video games and I seriously doubt I'll learn something new. Also, the book description says it all. When I started reading scientific articles about this phenomenon I thought that video games contributed to violence. I was amazed when I started reading the conclusions of those studies. The link between violence (especially murder) and video games is residual. There's no solid data that proves that you're more prone to violence if you play video games. The scientific literature about violence, delinquency, etc, etc, doesn't even qualify playing video games as a risk factor to engage in those kind of behaviors. PLUS, \"the epidemic of mass murders that they have unleashed.\"??? Sorry but you're talking about what? For something to be qualified as an epidemic it needs to spread and have an huge representation... where is that representation? Because some residual cases happened? And please, it's not because in ONE case sixty people died that we must call a mass murder an \"video game killing epidemic spree\". Seriously what is this? Are video games the new MORAL PANIC? Is this a tentative to spread fake data around to see if people get scared? Seriously it amazes me! What's next? Maybe write a follow up book about how gangsta rap spread an epidemic of mass murders?? Ice Cube sang about that...maybe it would be an awesome idea! Or how about one book about how driving a car contributes to an epidemic of beatings? For the sake of science, in your next book, leave science alone. Because there are millions of people that don't know what the scientific literature finds. And then, those people believe in what others write, even if they twist stuff up."}, {"userName": "Mary Loucks-Cummings", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5352494-mary-loucks-cummings", "userReview": "Every. Parent. Needs. To. Read. This. Book.  In our media-, electronics-, death-obsessed culture, we have got to get a handle on things before it gets even worse, and the first step is restricting children's access to violent video games (in addition to access to violent movies and TV... followed by limiting their screen time to a reasonable amount). I was surprised by how readable this text was, given all the statistics and studies within the pages. The indisputable, scientific evidence between interaction with violent media and violence acted out in real life will astound, and quite frankly, sicken, you. P.S. I have a hunch for the reason this book's average rating isn't better: many of the \"1\" ratings are from people who never actually read the book, but only read the subtitle and got offended because they themselves are gamers.

I'm so aghast at the frequency of these shootings -- acts of extreme violence that have never occurred in the history of humanity. And I'm looking for answers. How is that anyone can walk into a school and just shoot people dead? The author presents interesting facts, of which I haven't seen publicized anywhere else in these days following the shooting. While the author does seem biased against the media, I have to admit that the only mention I've seen of video game violence in popular discourse is a brief reference to one study that showed no connection between acts of violence and violent video game playing. There is no one easy answer to this modern social horror. But I think we as a society need to look clearly at the facts and at our knowledge of brain development....how can these violent video games NOT be affecting the brains of the people who play them? How can they NOT be sensitizing the players to horrific acts of violence? How can anyone find it FUN to simulate rape... cold blooded murder ... bloody, gory acts against innocent people? And how can anyone make a living designing such games? And live with themselves? Are they feeling any guilt at all with the increase in violent acts in recent decades?I did wish the author had not been so pro-gun. The other side of this issue is the ease with which anyone can purchase an automatic weapon. I am certainly not against people being able to arm and defend themselves, but I see no need for anyone to so easily access an automatic or semiautomatic weapon. While this book did not provide any straightforward answers, it was a reminder of the ongoing problem of our society's increasing casual attitude toward violence. How sad to live in a world where this is accepted. And even defended and glorified and rewarded."}, {"userName": "Linsey Adair", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8210809-linsey-adair", "userReview": "Because we live in a world that is far beyond that of our own childhoods, we must understand what was set in motion decades ago that touch pieces of how-the-world-works that I would never have thought to think about.Do you have children?

Assassination Generation was one of the few non-fiction books that I brought up with me because I was really interested in it. I've never been much of a violent video gamer. . . my days were filled with \"Who Wants to be a Millionaire Kids Edition\", \"Pacman\", and \"Diner Dash\". However, many of my friends play games that the author here would consider \"violent\", and I have to admit, I have wondered how violent video games affect people, especially kids. The information was there, although I have to admit some of the studies were pretty old. It was an interesting read, although I would've liked to see the author address some of the arguments from the other side, maybe even have a few rebuttals.

After all, the subtitle of this book is \u2018Video Games, Aggression, and the Psychology of Killing\u2019. I hadn\u2019t expected it to be so disturbing. This book rattled me to my core.Dave Grossman, the author of this book, is not a \u2018media specialist\u2019 or something similarly vague, like all-too-many authors of articles and books on the effects on video games on children. He\u2019s a retired Lt. Col. in the US Army, but also a former West Point Psychology professor and a recognized expert in the field of human aggression and the roots of violent crime, like killing. The reason I\u2019m leading with this, is because I was struck by how uniquely qualified this man is to talk about the psychology of killing.The key message of this book is simple: violent video games, especially first-person shooter games, influence children and teens in a highly negative way and have been essential in the epidemic of mass shootings. And the scientific evidence he lays out for this is overwhelming, disturbing, and has completely convinced me. Research after study has shown how exposing younger children to these games traumatizes them, how the brains of teens who play first-person shooter games a lot change, how their natural \u2018inhibition\u2019 to kill disappears. The book details how those gruesome mass killings we know all too well (Columbine, Sandy Hook, the mass murderer in Isla Vista, etc.) all have this one thing in common: the guys who did this (addictively) played these violent video games. You\u2019ll have to read the book to see all the evidence and facts, but one thing really stood out to me\u2014a highly disturbing fact. In real life, most killers don\u2019t shoot their victim in the head, but somewhere in the torso. Crime psychologists consider a victim shot in the head a highly personal murder, very violent. Most mass shootings however have resulted in victims being shot in the face. That\u2019s because in most first-person shooter games you get a reward for shooting your targets in the face. These killers had gotten so desensitized and numb by hundreds, thousands of hours of shooting in games that they were able to shoot first graders straight in the face. That alone made me get chills. To be honest, I started reading with a healthy dose of skepticism. I\u2019m not a gamer and my 9-year old son hasn\u2019t progressed beyond Skylanders yet (and after reading this book I can safely say he won\u2019t be playing these games as long as he\u2019s under my roof), so I can\u2019t say I have much experience with violent games. I\u2019ve seen them, of course, having worked in youth ministry for a long time. I would have imagined they\u2019d had some impact, but not like this. Not in a brain-altering, becoming completely desensitized way. And like the author, I see far-reaching complications for the future. That\u2019s the highly disturbing part of this book (as were some of the descriptions of games, which went way further than I had even thought possible). On a side note: from a purely writing perspective, this is not the best book I\u2019ve read\u2014far from it. The structure wasn\u2019t entirely clear to me and at times it felt repetitive. The message and sheer facts were so impressive though, that I still consider this a groundbreaking book."}, {"userName": "Melissa Ross", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30958204-melissa-ross", "userReview": "As the mom of teen boys, I always wonder about the impact of video games. Each has a few he likes to play. Each has one first person shooter game he likes to play. Each boy argues that no one can prove that video games make kids violent.This book does a good job of discussing the studies that have been done about video games and their impact on the mindset of violence. Some of the studies were older, but some of the more recent ones had merit. Most concerning to me were the stories related about mass shootings and the accuracy the shooters had developed from near constant video game play of first person shooters.On the positive side, the studies have also shown that detoxing a child from video games can happen very quickly and the detox not only reduces violent reactions, but allows the children to focus more on school and family.While I believe that video games are dangerous, I found the book reassuring of our family's approach: limited video game time, awareness of the games that the boys are playing, and attention to their behavior and reactions."}, {"userName": "Allison", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/987360-allison", "userReview": "I am a gamer and an educator.

Littleton, Colorado, 1999: two high school seniors kill a teacher, twelve other students, and then themselves.

A young person's obsession with video games that teach to kill.Lt. Col. Dave Grossman, who in his perennial bestseller On Killingrevealed that most of us are not \"natural born killers\" - and who has spent decades training soldiers, police, and others who keep us secure to overcome the intrinsic human resistance to harming others and to use firearms responsibly when necessary - turns a laser focus on the threat posed to our society by violent video games.Drawing on crime statistics, cutting-edge social research, and scientific studies of the teenage brain, Col. Grossman shows how video games that depict antisocial, misanthropic, casually savage behavior can warp the mind - with potentially deadly results.
