But, oddly, what happened outside was like a dream. It was inside the still church, before its reappearing picture, that was real. I drifted across the rest. As I have said--like a dream. For a time.\"Tom Birken is summoned to the countryside from the teaming streets of London to practice his craft revealing a Medieval painting that was originally painted 500 years previously, and had been whitewashed over about a hundred years later. It is a picture of doom predating the fantastical, terrifying visions of Bruegel by at least a hundred years.\nMad Meg by Pieter Bruegel\nTriumph of Death by Pieter BruegelBirken in 1920 is a shattered man. He has survived the war, but experienced his own vision of hell on the battle field of Passchendaele. The estimations are that the British allies and the Germans each lost over 200,000 men between July and November of 1917. He emerged from the wreckage of that battle, shell shocked, and still three years later betrays himself with a stammer and twitching cheek when he is experiencing a stressful moment. He has acquired a skill, a skill nearly expired, of carefully revealing and preserving old murals on church walls. The Oxgodby job is a gift, maybe one of the few remaining times when he will practice his craft. \"Our jobs are our private fantasies, our disguises, the clock we can creep inside to hide.\" He has a wife who has betrayed him, a war that has wounded him, and a world that is telling him that his skills are obsolete. He needed this job.\nHe has no idea what is behind the whitewash, but it isn't long before he knows he is working on a masterpiece. \"So, each day, I released a few more inches of a seething cascade of bones, joints and worm-riddled vitals frothing over the fiery weir. It was breathtaking. A tremendous waterfall of color, the blues of the apex falling, then seething into a turbulence of red; like all truly great works of art, hammering you with its whole before beguiling you with its parts.\"\nMedieval era wall muralHe meets a man named Moon who is camping in a tent in the cemetery and has been commissioned to find the bones of an ancestor for their patron. As time goes on, and both men realize how simply wonderful this moment in time has been for them, they start to linger in their work, making it last, not wanting it to end. There is a story about Moon that you will have to read the book to discover. Oh and lets not forget that Birken meets a woman. Not just any woman, but one of those women that turn your knees to jelly and in the case of Birken make his cheek twitch. She is the vicar's wife, Mrs. Alice Keach. She was much younger than Keach(the vicar), no more than nineteen or twenty, and she was very lovely. More than just pleasant-looking I mean; she was quite enchanting. Her neck was uncovered to her bosom, and immediately, I was reminded of Botticelli--not his Venus--the Primavera. It was partly her wonderfully oval face and partly the easy way she stood. I'd seen enough paintings to know beauty when I saw it and, in this out of the way place, here it was before me.\"Netflix has yet again let me down. There is a movie from 1987 starring Kenneth Branagh and Colin Firth, but Netflix does not have it. At this point it appears I will have to buy it to see it. I can only hope that they do the book justice. \nKenneth Branagh as Moon. Natasha Richardson as Alice Keach. Colin Firth as Birken.The introduction to the book in the NYRB version is written by Michael Holroydand it is excellent. I love it when an introduction fires up the reader to read the book. He talks about his own odd intersection with J. L. Carr, but the most resonating bit he shares is in regards to Carr's funeral. \n\"Carr died in 1994 and his funeral service in the Kettering parish church was, in the words of Byron Rogers, 'like the passing of a spymaster.' He had such disparate interests that there seem to have been many J. L. Carrs, and since he compartmentalized his friendships, few of his friends knew each other. 'What I remember most about his funeral service was the fidgeting...as the mourners kept squinting sideways to speculate about their neighbors,' Rogers wrote. 'Then, at the very last minute there was a clatter of high heels and a very young, very beautiful woman came in, dressed in fashionable black. She came alone and at the end was gone, just as abruptly, into the March afternoon.' No one knew her or could find out who she was--an ex-pupil, mistress, cricketer, flower-arranger, Sunday School teacher...but readers of A Month in the Country may feel that she had stepped out of its pages.\nDon't miss this one, a more than pleasant diversion for a Sunday afternoon. You will be right there in Oxgodby falling in love, gnashing your teeth over the absurdity of it all,enjoying the peacefulness of knowing, really knowing you are happy, and you too might discover the importance of lingering over a moment, a glorious moment when life seems to be working for you and not against you. If you are like me you might even find yourself yelling \"for godsakes take her in your arms and kiss her.\" Highly Recommended!\nThe Mysterious J. L.

Last week I saw a review for J. L. Carr's Man Booker winning A Month in the Country and was intrigued enough by the title to read it for myself. Using stunning prose combined with well developed characters, Carr's novella is perfect for a leisurely summer morning. Tom Birkin had survived the Great War yet returned alienated from civilian life. While in present times his feelings can be ascribed to survivor's guilt or post traumatic stress disorder, in 1920 Birkin did not have an outlet for his feelings. His wife Vinny had left him for another man, leaving the door open for his return. Disillusioned with life as a temporarily single man in London, Birkin accepts a job in a small northern hamlet of Oxgodby to unearth a painting and artist from the 1340s. Even though this out of the way life is not what Birkin had envisioned for himself, he welcomes the opportunity to get out of his situation and avoid the present mess of his marriage. While in Oxgodby, Birkin encounters a quaint cast of characters. Fellow excavator Michael Moon has come north for the same reasons as Birkin. The two share war stories and their views on life in general as they attempt to meet their deadlines in unearthing medieval men. As the two outsiders enjoy a cordial relationship, Birkin also interacts with locals. Kathy Ellenbeck is a precocious fourteen year old who seems to know everything about everyone. I found her exchanges to be humorous. Meanwhile, Birkin is smitten with the vicar's wife, Alice Keach. A young woman of no more than twenty, Alice is both intuitive and beautiful, yet off limits. It is through his and Alice's non relationship that allows Birkin to assess his own life situation. In his novella, Carr employs descriptive prose that has me longing for a countryside. Warm summer days are perfect for picnics, budding romances, and staying up late contemplating one's role in life. Carr develops characters in Birkin and Moon who are non believers yet are employed by a church. Most of the action occurs within the belfry where Birkin works and sleeps, even the contrast as he fights an inner impulse to strike up relations with Alice. For a male author, I enjoyed Carr's development of his female characters and was glad that they were simply platonic. All good things come to an end. Birkin narrates this story while looking back 58 years later having never returned to Oxgodby. The story moved by quickly and Birkin finished his work, the church goers almost relieved when he returned to London. Carr's story is indeed appropriate for a lazy summer morning. A Month in the Country is a relaxing novella with strong characters for a summer day, and, like Birkin, when I was finished reading it, it was time to get on with my everyday life. 4 solid stars."}, {"userName": "Cecily", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1199525-cecily", "userReview": "[who the falling man was, why he was covered up almost as soon as the mural was finished, and why the grave Moon finds is not on consecrated ground (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Dolors", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18383778-dolors", "userReview": "\u201cIf I\u2019d stayed there, would I always have been happy? No, I suppose not. People move away, grow older, die, and the bright belief that there will be another marvelous thing around each corner fades. It is now or never; we must snatch at happiness as it flies.\u201dDo we recognize happiness when we live it? Or is it a condition we only perceive in retrospection remembering the past through the rose-tinted glasses of memory?Wales, 1978. Thomas Birkin, a survivor of the Great War, travels back in time to the 1920s and reconstructs a month spent in the rural village of Oxgodby, North Yorkshire. Employed to recover a concealed medieval painting on the wall of the local church, Thomas believes that a change of scenery will soothe the scars the bloodbath of war and a shattered marriage have imprinted on him. Regardless of his skeptical attitude towards religion, the placid rhythm of summer days ripened by the sun and the quaint temperament of some of the townspeople will guide him inadvertently, not only to uncover the mysteries surrounding the mural painting, but also towards his spiritual restoration.\u201cThis is what I need, I thought - a new start and, afterwards, maybe I won\u2019t be a casualty anymore.\u201dThomas is a product of his generation. Gifted with excessive self-awareness, uncommon lucidity and a rare sense of humor, he speaks from the intimacy of a first-person narrator and makes the reader a sensory participant of the impact a few weeks spent among strangers in self-effacing examination, of how a tiny parcel of his history, infused him with a renewed zest for life. J.L. Carr\u2019s masterstroke is to tinge the mural of Thomas\u2019 chronicle with a gossamer of vivid observations that sparkle the old flame of hope, which glows brighter than ever when Alice Keach, the Minister\u2019s wife, pierces through Thomas\u2019 numbness with her curious vitality. The world unfolds in a palette of intricate details, delightful snapshots of daily postcards. A blooming rose in a hat, the comfortable dampness of concentrated craft under the roof timbers, the buzz of insects and the twittering of birds and blades of grass swaying with the gentle breeze, passers-by that matter and others that don\u2019t leave track, silent conversations with the Moon, the lazy hours of a summer inexorably crawling towards a perennial exuberance, the intoxicating scent of serendipitous friendship, of wistful love, sweet, fleeting, unattainable, of wanting to memorize the shape of an oval face before it is too late, the devastating certainty of knowing it is gone forever. To feel pain means to be alive and the resolution to pursue happiness is a courageous vow that Thomas is willing to take. The fallen man of the mural painting couldn\u2019t have imagined that a fellow artist would recover his masterpiece, lost to the world under whitewash for more than five centuries. Thomas Birkin never envisioned being haunted by happiness fifty years after a life-altering moment that presented itself wrapped in balustrades of washed-out color. And there was no way I could have known the heart-wrenching journey to the past that awaited me in barely a hundred pages. Do we glorify the past in order to cope with the present as a form of self-protection? I suppose we do. But if giving way to nostalgic reverie allows us not to regret missed opportunites that choke us in waves of self-pity and prompts us to be grateful for small streaks of fortune instead, I will settle on melancholy any given day. Only then, the tugging at the heart for moments gone for good might leave a sweet, lingering taste in our lips, like the promise of an unsealed kiss, of not squandered words, that might last the span of a lifetime."}, {"userName": "Sue", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3642045-sue", "userReview": "This will likely enter the list of my all-time favorite books. I found myself saying \"glorious\" several times and then stopping to thank my parents for instilling in me their love of reading. That brought me so belatedly to this treasure of a book.I know that the basic story is well known, the young re-patriated soldier, spending a month in the English countryside at a small chapel, tasked to uncover a centuries old mural. But the tale is so much more than that because the prose is so much more than that. Carr captures moments in so many ways. One small moment:The sound of bees foraging from flower to flower seemed to deepen the stillness. (p42)I've experienced such moments but never seen it written so.And a longer evocation of the land he was coming to love:There was so much time that marvelous summer. Day after day, mist rose from the meadow as the sky lightened and hedges, barns and woods took shape until, at last, the long curving back of the hills lifted away from the Plain. It was a sort of stage magic--- \"Now you don't see; indeed, there is nothing to see.  Now look!\" Day after day it was like that and each  morning I leaned on the yard gate dragging at my first fag and (I'd like to think) marveling at this splendid backcloth. But it can't have been so; I'm not the  marveling kind. Or was I then? But one thing is sure--- I had a feeling of immense content and, if I thought at  all, it was that I'd like this to go on and on... (p 61)Simply put, this book has given me all I look for: a cascade of words that ring so true and are beautifully written; wonderfully realised characters even though we know them so briefly; a perfect setting (especially for an Anglophile who loves art and archaeology); and a simple story about complex people.I would rated this more than 5 if I could."}, {"userName": "Fionnuala", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5498525-fionnuala", "userReview": "When we pick up a book by an author we haven\u2019t read before, we have only the vaguest notion of what themes it will contain. We don't know how those themes will be treated, what attention to detail we will find or if the language will delight us or otherwise. Before we turn over that first page, it is all as blank as a whitewashed wall. We may bring expectations to the blank piece of wall, expectations based on the period the book is set in or from the opinions of readers we trust, but any clarity on the book\u2019s contents will remain largely hidden. Sometimes our expectations are rewarded right at the beginning. On the first page of this book, I found myself tumbling onto the platform of Oxgodby station alongside the narrator, and the way in which those first words were assembled announced clearly that this was going to be an especially rewarding read. I didn\u2019t quite know how the author would manage this feat but I was confident it would turn out to be so. And although it was a slow reveal, within the first few pages I saw many more signs of promise, a little brush stroke here so that a particular character came into better focus, a little sketch there so that I gained a clearer idea of the background, a little foreshadowing so that I could make a stab at guessing the main theme, a little mystery so that I knew there remained riches yet to be discovered.As I read on, my first impressions took definite shape and I was able to admire the craft with which the story unfolded. I understood why the author lingered on such and such an idea, why he mentioned that particular subject more than once. As the pages read became greater than the pages left to read, I was able to guess at pretty much everything that remained to be told except for one or two details, but I still delighted in the manner of the telling and the little traces of humour inserted in the text like private jokes between the author and the narrator. It was clear to me too that there was no editorial interference; Carr shaped this book to fit the pattern and timing of the central theme, and without any thought for the dictates of the publishing world or any particular genre it might be expected to fit into. He was a master of his craft.The book was a treasure that was slowly uncovered; when it was fully exposed, I was astounded by the beauty of the work in its entirety and the image it left on my consciousness will remain with me for a long time to come.

If I search my memories, I find a sixteen year old girl sitting in a canoe, with a boy, fishing at two o'clock in the morning by the eerie light of the midnight sun, on a glassy lake near Whitehorse, Yukon. Everything is tingly and pulsing with youth. I look a little more and see myself choking back tears on a hospital bed with my beloved grandfather, hearing him say \"I'm still your grandpa, Robin\", knowing I would never see him again, but feeling gratitude for the absolute purity of the moment. I look again, and watch myself, a brand new mother, rocking my baby during one of our midnight meetings, in the stillness, the newborn puzzle piece nested against my breast. Unconditional love was being hatched in my heart.Those moments are the jewels of life.J.L. Carr's novella explores such perfect times, through the character of Tom Birkin. Set in the summer of 1920, but related in 1978, an older Birkin is remembering the month during which he is hired to uncover a medieval mural in a church in northern England. Damaged by time served in WWI and a bad marriage, Birkin arrives at Oxgodby fairly shattered and alone. This time serves as a salve on his heart, a reminder of the beauty of art, but also of nature, of simple pastoral idyls and country people. As he uncovers the painting, he is also uncovering the masterpiece of his self, his wonder at the world and whatever lies ahead.I had a feeling of immense content and, if I thought at all, it was that I'd like this to go on and on, no-one going, no-one coming, autumn and winter always loitering around the corner, the summer's ripeness lasting forever, nothing disturbing the even tenor of my way.The story is bittersweet though, and as much as my heart swells, it is also anguished. The perfect time comes to its inevitable conclusion. The time, like any other, becomes anthologized into history. That which felt never-ending, ended. Chances ran out. Opportunities untaken. But, the older Birkin is aware that perfect moments can stretch into an imperfect life. Things could have turned out differently, but would they have lasted? Is it better that the memories remain totally untainted, a glimmering reminder that life can be hopeful, warm and gentle? This reader was aching for lovers to kiss in the church belfry, but instead, the fleeting month is chastely frozen in time, like a painting, full of promise and optimism.If I had stayed there, would I have always been happy?

In my case, however, it's unfortunately one of those texts that is going to send me off on a long personal anecdote, for which I offer advance apologies.When I was twenty-one I ended up, for a variety of reasons, living in Quito, Ecuador. The city in those days was a steamy melting-pot of different nationalities, full of Colombian exiles that had fled the violence north of the border, and teeming with renegade expats from a scattering of unusual countries. My closest acquaintances included an American Vietnam vet, a British army deserter, a Colombian street artist, a badly-disguised CIA agent, a drug-dealer for the Medell\u00edn cartel and an Italian architect who kept a Picasso hidden under his bed. It was a weird time. But the first person I met there was a girl from Sweden called Lina. We lived in the same building, and on my first night in the city she took me out for a Mexican and we got hammered on strawberry daiquiris, and the evening slowly evolved into a strange date which she orchestrated with Scandinavian directness: \u2018You buy me a drink now. You take me dancing now.\u2019 I was charmed.I had come to South America to get over someone after an awful breakup, and so I wasn't looking for anything. I wanted zero complications. Right? Sure. As I said to myself on several occasions. So nothing happened that night. Nothing happened the next night either, or any of the nights that followed as we got involved in the strange life of Quito, and dealt with death threats and psychotic outbreaks and false passports and the other things affecting our circle of friends. And we got to know each other quite well. We went away together for a couple of weekends, and talked about past relationships; and most evenings in Ecuador ended with us on our balcony as the sun came up, finishing a bottle of rum and sharing stories. We both had a couple of flings with random people, but nothing very serious.And then eventually after nine months or so I'd run out of money, and some job offer had come through in England, and I found myself spending the last of my funds on a plane ticket back to London. We drank a lot in my final week. On the last night we just sat on our balcony for hours and had a bottle of rum and listened to the sounds coming out of the karaoke bar two doors down. And when we went back inside she brought me into her room, for the first time since I'd arrived, to say goodbye. And I don't know if it was because of timidity or inexperience or a desire not to spoil anything, or drunkenness, or accumulated misunderstanding, but neither of us did anything except say goodnight and goodbye.And I'm very annoyed about it. After everything we went through we deserved to have it end in some shared moment of sexiness, instead of petering out the way it did. You worry a lot about situations like that when you're in them, and then later you realize that you were worrying about exactly the wrong aspects of them.I have no room left to actually review this book, except to say that the situation I'm badly describing is one that novelists don't often try to address, preferring as they do to deal with actual, rather than potential, love affairs. But this book does, and it does it really well. It's the 20s, not the 90s; it's Yorkshire, not Ecuador; she's a vicar's wife, not a Swedish charity worker; most of all, he's a shell-shocked First World War veteran instead of a lazy arts graduate.

I admit that the subject was not of interest to me, life in the country does not feel too enticing. What can I say, I am a city girl. I love nature but for short periods of time. Actually, three stars is the highest rating I gave to a novel about country life. For me, Levin's story in Anna Karenina was the most excruciatingly boring piece of literature I've read. So you should take my rating as an endorsement of this book's quality. I've waited for a week before writing a review because I did not have much to say and, as I am typing, I realize I still don't. You know, it was lovely and melodic. The setting was idyllic, rolling hills, sheep, a nice little church with a hidden painting waiting to be revealed by our main character. The people were all so nice, some had a bit of mystery around them which could have been more explored, in my opinion. A bit of unexpressed illicit love.

This wasn\u2019t what I expected, especially initially. I thought it was written in the 1920s and would be an understated tastefully written meditation on the healing powers of art. Instead the narrator is a bantering almost Jack-the laddish character who refers to his backside as his bum and imagines the vicar and his wife having sex. I was a bit shocked until I saw it was written in 1980. Half way through I was wondering what all the fuss is about. It was confusing me. The narrator is a shellshocked World War One veteran who is hired to restore a fresco in a church that has mysteriously been painted over. But there was another shellshocked veteran called Moon hired to solve another mystery of the village\u2019s past. Why was the central character duplicated? And instead of the fresco the focus of the novel turned to the narrator\u2019s crush on the vicar\u2019s wife. What was that all about? I don\u2019t think I ever quite understood except for the rather banal truism that there\u2019s nothing like romance to heal a blighted soul. Also the narrative begins to focus on his visits to various people in the surrounding countryside. The large cast of characters began to seem more suitable for a novel of 300 pages than a novella of only eighty. Especially when we\u2019re introduced to another potential love interest who, it turns out, will make one appearance in the narrative and then vanish. It all seemed very muddled to me. Little sideshows like this can dull a book\u2019s focus, especially in one as short as this. I enjoyed the final third more. Suddenly the fresco comes to life. It\u2019s a depiction of Christ\u2019s Judgement and one face in particular haunts the narrator. But oddly this character in the painting has far more relevance to Moon\u2019s fate than it does to the narrator\u2019s, though it appears the narrator doesn\u2019t see this. In fact, more than once, I wondered if this Moon, a black sheep as it turns out, wouldn\u2019t have been a more compelling centrepiece for this story. But he never gets to experience his epiphany in the novel. There\u2019s a mood now of summer dying into autumn. And a poignant sense of how fleeting the idyllic moment is; how the present becomes the past in the blink of an eyelid. The writing, especially the nature description, is excellent throughout. For me though there was a lack of artistry in the way Carr organised his material, some of which didn\u2019t even seem to belong in the novel. At the end of the day it was much more a novella about a missed romantic opportunity than the psychological consequences of war or the healing potential of art. In the final paragraphs Carr tries to shift the focus from the vicar\u2019s wife to the sustaining noblesse of artistic aspiration but it felt a bit forced. As a nostalgic elegy for the virtues of pastoral life it works better. Though one could argue none of those virtues has wholly vanished and this is essentially a sentimental view of change. What vanishes is one\u2019s youth \u2013 the young person one once was who enjoyed these virtues."}, {"userName": "Ted", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7213075-ted", "userReview": "[And now, one hundred years after the Great War started, perhaps another chance to think about this time, in the early 20s, in which a survivor like Birkin finds meaning again in his life; unlike many, who either didn't make it through to the other side, or did, but lived a life ruined forever by the experience.

He arrives in Oxgodby, a small village in Yorkshire, because a bequest to the local church has stipulated that a medieval wall painting should be uncovered and he has accepted the commission. The village is deliberately set up as a rural idyll, where he can rediscover a sense of purpose, but this is no sentimental romantic vision. There is plenty of humour, especially about the relationship and rivalry between Church and Chapel, and some wonderful period detail. It transpires that an archaeologist, Moon, has also been commissioned by the same bequest to find the grave of an excommunicated ancestor who was said to be buried outside the church yard, and their discoveries eventually converge in a surprising way.

L. Carr's deeply charged poetic novel, Tom Birkin, a veteran of the Great War and a broken marriage, arrives in the remote Yorkshire village of Oxgodby where he is to restore a recently discovered medieval mural in the local church. Living in the bell tower, surrounded by the resplendent countryside of high summer, and laboring each day to uncover an anonymous painter's depiction of the apocalypse, Birkin finds that he himself has been restored to a new, and hopeful, attachment to life. But summer ends, and with the work done, Birkin must leave. Now, long after, as he reflects on the passage of time and the power of art, he finds in his memories some consolation for all that has been lost.My Review: A few, a precious few only, moments in life are trapped in the diamond facets of unforgettability. The moments that, in the movie we're all directing inside our heads at any given moment, define our character. In all senses of that word. Be they happy, sad, public, private, we all have them; very very few of us talk much about them; and almost no one makes art from them.Carr made art from a crystalline moment. Cold, glittering art, fire banked in its facets, glinting at the reader from sly angles and unexpected edges. Was this akin to his own character defining moment? I certainly don't know, but I suspect so. It's the best explanation I have for small moments clearly real and recalled in fresh, bright colors and sharp, focused images.She lived at a farmhouse gable end to the road--not a big place. Deep red hollyhocks pressed against the limestone wall and velvet butterflies flopped lazily from flower to flower. It was Tennyson weather, drowsy, warm, unnaturally still. Her father and mother made me very welcome, both declaring they'd never met a Londoner before. They gave me what, in these parts, was called a knife-and-fork \"do,\" a ham off the hook, a deep apple pie, and scalding tea. In conversation it came out that I'd been Over There (as they called it) and this spurred them to thrust more prodigious helpings upon me.Novelists store moments like this, personal moments, in vaults that all of us have. The difference is the vault of the artist preserves all the details and nuances. Most of us come back from the vault with tatters and shreds; Carr, and others like him, come back with precious parures that flash a dazzle upon us commoners.The genius of this short novel, under 50,000 words, is that it doesn't tart up the glory of the images with overwrought settings. Keep it simple, make it well, and quality will out. It is a joy to find laughs and savors in the same book. It is a rare joy to find them polished to a deep flash, set at just the right moment, and not vulgarly paraded for our approval but rather simply put in their proper place and left for us to notice as we will.I made a run at this book after reading most of a very, very unhappy and terrible book. I was weighed down, felt that page-turning was labor. After a good sleep, I picked this gem up again and began at the beginning. It was the correct decision.We can ask and ask but we can't have again what once seemed ours for ever--the ways things looked, that church alone in the fields, a bed on a belfry floor, a remembered voice, the touch of a hand, a loved face. They've gone and you can only wait for the pain to pass.How much poorer my world would be without the quiet luxury of these images in it.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License."}, {"userName": "Margitte", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte", "userReview": "I am not going to write an elaborate review for this book.

He survived WWI but his wife left him for another man. He had little else to lose when he left for the northern village where the church is located. While cleaning up the painting, he intensely experiences the joy and sorrows of the original artist, as though they were communicating across the centuries, even discovering how the unknown master died so many centuries ago.

In the appendix to the British paperback edition, she lists a number of novels as being especially important to her: I Capture the Castle (Dodie Smith), A Month in the Country (J. L. Carr), Jane Eyre, Tess of the Durbervilles, and A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovitch. Most of them I have read, but I knew the first two only by reputation. Perry has inspired me to remedy that omission.]Although brief and charmingly unpretentious, this little novella caught me in a time warp from the very first page, and did not let go until the end. A man gets off a steam train at the Yorkshire village of Oxgodby, carrying an odd assortment of baggage and wearing a prewar coat. Which war? Everything was pointing to 1920 or so; the style, the detail, the off-hand humor of the first-person narration was absolutely that of a memoir of the period, the genuine article. I looked at the copyright: 1980. Something must be wrong; surely the date must refer to some later edition? But no: James Lloyd Carr was only three when war broke out; this novella, though clearly based on some of his real-life experiences, is an extraordinary feat of imagining himself back to an earlier time.Tom Birkin is a veteran of Passchendaele in WW1, and further reeling from his wife's desertion; a nervous twitch disfigures one side of his face. He has accepted a commission to uncover a medieval mural of the Last Judgement hidden behind layers of whitewash on the apse of a village church, sleeping in the belfry and attending to his needs behind the cowshed. There is one other veteran similarly employed, an ex-captain called Moon, who is searching for the tomb of a disgraced ancestor of the lady of the manor, whose wealth will not be available to the parish until these tasks have been performed. The vicar, Rev. Keach, is a misanthropic skinflint living in a vast decaying rectory; his beautiful young wife, however, takes to visiting the church to watch Tom at work. Another visitor is the young daughter of the stationmaster, who involves Tom in the Sunday life of her father's Wesleyan chapel, which he finds more to his secular taste than the services in the dusty church.If Birkin was not always an unbeliever, his experiences in the Flanders mud have made him so. Yet religion plays a great part in the novel. Bit by bit, as he works on the apse mural, he sees that it is a masterpiece, executed with a richness of color, eye for detail, and sense of drama that propels it right out of its time. While the side showing the blessed ascending into Heaven is blandly conventional, the part depicting Hell is strikingly personal. Birkin has known his own hell at the front; Moon has been through a hell of his own, but of a different kind; Alice Keach, the vicar's wife, indicates that she may know yet another kind of hell, but this is left for Tom and the reader to surmise. All the same, amid the work at the Church and hymns at the Chapel, a real restoration is taking place. It is not just the painting that comes to life, but Tom Birkin himself. He finds himself making friends, expanding from his solitude into the life of the community, taking a whole day off with Moon, for instance, to help with the harvest. Tom is slowly getting cured. This book stands, I think, with Pat Barker's \nRegeneration\n as one of the great novels about first-war shell-shock and the road beyond it.I have no idea why Carr chose the same title as the famous Turgenev play. Perhaps because both works share the same sense of erotic possibility never entirely realized. But I think it is another of Carr's games with time. You expect four weeks, five at the most. But the endless summer stretches for month after month until one morning, after an overnight storm, Birkin suddenly realizes that summer has gone, autumn too, and that all around him people are preparing for winter. If I had any doubt before, the beauty of Carr's final pages convince me that he was a great writer\u2014not of our time for sure, not even of his own, but heir to the great tradition of English pastoral melancholy, the poetry of A. E. Houseman and autumnal music of Edward Elgar:\nIt would be like someone coming to Malvern, bland Malvern, who suddenly is halted by the thought that Edward Elgar walked this road on his way to give music lessons or, looking over to the Clee Hills, reflects that Houseman has stood also in that place, regretting his land of lost content. And, at such a time, for a few of us there will always be a tugging at the heart\u2014knowing a precious moment has gone and we are not there.We can ask and ask but we can't have again what once seemed ours for ever\u2014the way things looked, that church alone in the fields, a bed on a belfry floor, a remembered voice, a loved face. They've gone and you only wait for the pain to pass.\n+ + + + + +FOOTNOTE 1 : THE MOVIEI ordered the movie after reading the novel. Made in 1987, it stars the young Colin Firth (Birkin), Kenneth Branagh (Moon), and Miranda Richardson (Mrs Keach). All are perfect in their parts, and the whole thing is beautifully filmed in the Yorkshire countryside. A special feature is the use of existing music (I think I caught Vaughan Williams and some Tallis) that exactly fits subject and period. Any fears that the film might coarsen the quiet understatement of the novel are entirely unfounded. \"Understatement\" here is itself an understatement; the strongest emotions are conveyed in silence; Miranda Richardson is especially poignant in this regard.[The one exception (and this surprised me) is the soldier Birkin encounters in the York cafe, who tells him about Moon. In the book, as I recall, it was handled with some subtlety; here, it is merely vindictive and frankly unbelievable.]Carr's novella is short, but in order to give the movie the space it needs, much has had to be cut. Birkin's relationship with the Chapel folk, for example, is greatly abbreviated, and that final harvesting scene has been omitted. As for the mural Birkin is supposed to be restoring, the painter hired by the film company has done a terrific job, but by the same token, what you see is what you get; you are not left with the idea that this is a work of blazing genius, as is possible when all you have are the author's words.Be warned, though: there are no subtitles. Given that many of the characters, especially the children, have strong Yorkshire accents, this makes it all but incomprehensible at times. And the pervasive understatement in both Branagh and Firth's delivery makes for a lot of tailing off and murmuring. Not therefore recommended for the hard of hearing!+ + + + + +FOOTNOTE 2 : THE COVERNew York Review Books are usually so marvelous with their covers that it baffles me how they could have chosen this Bonnard painting for this particular book. It is indeed vibrant and gorgeous, but it gives an entirely wrong idea of the novel. Mediterranean color for Yorkshire rain? Hot passion for understated erotic possibility? An close interior for a book that is spent largely outdoors or in drafty churches? I tried playing with similar covers using an English artist of the period, Stanley Spencer. They don't all work equally well (I would have loved to have found a Spencer painting of a church without other figures in the foreground), but any one of them sets up better expectations than the Bonnard."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4643325-paul", "userReview": "I intend to read some novels that are first World War based for this year\u2019s anniversary and this one is the first. It is a novella by a rather eccentric teacher turned writer which absolutely captures a time and place. The plot is straightforward. Tom Birkin is a WW1 veteran who was injured at Paschendaele and is troubled by his memories and dreams and by a failed marraige. It is the summer of 1920 and Birkn has taken a job in the remote Yorkshire village of Oxgodby. He is to uncover a medieval mural that has been painted over for many years. His living accommodation is the belfry of the Church. Nearby another war veteran, James Moon is digging for a lost grave which may hols some sort of secret because it was placed outside of the churchyard. He also has his scars from the war.There is a full cast of local characters; the local vicar and his beautiful wife and the rival Wesleyan Methodists. Carr, being brought up in the Wesleyan tradition captures the chapel rituals and attendees very well. Carr said he wanted the effect to be something like Hardy\u2019s Under the Greenwood Tree in relation to the local characters.The novella is beautifully written. It is a hot summer and has the nostalgic feel of soporific summers long gone and barely imagined. It feels a little like Cider with Rosie; the end of an age. The remoteness of the village means there is a lag with the changes taking place in society. It feels like the end of something and Birkin feels that as well. Carr illustrates rural crafts and customs about to disappear. He even mentions the food. Seed Cake!! My grandmother used to make seed cake; it\u2019s rarely seen now. It is about love, loss, pain and healing; but it is all subtly done.Birkin is looking back from 1978 and I am reminded of Hartley\u2019s quote \u201cThe past is a foreign country, they do things differently there\u201d. There are also interesting reflections about art and the relationship between the painter and the latter day restorer. There is potential for Birkin to have a relationship, but that would have spoilt the subtlety of the whole thing. It is a wonderful, subtle and heartbreaking novel; one of the best in this genre I am sure."}, {"userName": "Perry", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6354112-perry", "userReview": "Haunted by the Happiness of Halcyon Days, Waiting for the Pain to Pass\"Now for a breath I tarry,Nor yet disperse apart--Take my hand quick and tell me,What have you in your heart.\"A.E.

It was sometimes boring and disorganized, and also sometimes inspired and filled with big, important \u201cthinks.\u201d I thought, quite mistakenly, that it was a summer-inspired travelogue, in the spirit of a book penned by a Frances Mayes or a Gerald Durrell, but instead it was a book about post-war trauma, dark in tone and unsure of its arc. Also, I believe that many writers who actually WROTE in the 1920s had a more modern voice and a more progressive feel than Mr. Carr did, writing this as a reflective novel, 60 years later. In a brief, two page Foreword, the author tells the reader that he set out to write \u201can easy-going story, a rural idyll along the lines of Thomas Hardy's Under the Greenwood Tree,\u201d but, that \u201cwhile one is writing about the past, a story is colored by what presently is happening to its writer.\u201dI have two comments to make about those combined quotes: first, how did I, a devoted reader of Thomas Hardy, miss the ONE easy-going story that he apparently wrote and second, why did Mr. Carr set out to write a story of healing, as his wife lay dying of lung cancer in the background?Perhaps he just. . . needed to write about healing, maybe hoping the ideology would stick, but, while he takes the reader on Tom Birkin's post-war route to healing, he just keeps getting stuck. I felt that Tom, as a character, goes nowhere, really, and even though nature and community and art help him to lose his post-war stammer and tic, when his story ends in autumn, it looks surprisingly similar to what it looked like in spring.There are some sad lines here, about what Tom thinks God looks like in the small town where he's working: \u201cuncompromising. . . no, more\u2014threatening. This is my hand. This is what you did to me. And, for this, many shall suffer the torment, for thus it was for me.\u201dHe claims his feeling of God is one of unbelief. . . but those are not the words of an unbeliever, they are the words of a man who feels God exists, and hates him.He adds, later, \u201cI stumbled on, tossing in pleas to be forgiven for unmentionable sins I felt were His responsibility. . . rather than mine.\u201dPoor Mr. Carr. There's so much pain here, so much suffering. I can imagine he was damned angry at everyone, and you can feel it, scattered, all over the pages.I don't want anyone reading this to think that I shy away from books that tackle difficult subjects. I don't; I often embrace them. It's just that it all felt so raw and unfocused, almost like reading someone's unedited journal, or the work of a much younger writer.And, I have already admitted to going into this read with a bias, which is always a bad idea.It's not an accident that Mr. Carr references both Hardy and Housman, he was a fan and a teacher of both. Me, too.But, even though I think he had a great idea, to tell a Hardy-inspired story where an \u201cart restorer\u201d is actually restored by art, I don't really think it happens here."}, {"userName": "Declan", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5848260-declan", "userReview": "The descriptions in 'A Month in the Country' do not draw particular attention to ambient sounds or noise (it is in any case a consistently subtle book in which everything occurs with a minimum of fuss), but I suspect that one of the major comforts of Tom Birkin's time in Oxgodby, and one of the reasons he is content for the work of restoration to take longer than he had intended, is that the rich, enveloping quite of the church - birdsong outside; the rhythmic tapping of his tools; the barely discernible sound of Moon digging - is a startling contrast to the uproar of war which assailed his ears so recently.That work of restoration is, of course, personal as well as practical. He is slowly removing the accretions of many decades from the wall at the back of a small church, to reveal an exceptional work of medieval painting. But - and again there is nothing laboured about the way this is done - he also begins to reveal and reconcile aspects of himself that have been sundered by the war and a difficult marriage. The purposeful nature of his work and the excitement of what he, day-by-day, is discovering about the mural together with the comradeship of archaeologist Moon and his easily formed friendships with several of the people in the village help him begin to understand the importance of human contact and community involvement. More than with any other, his conversations with the vicars beautiful wife give him a real sense of what it is to hope again; to feel the absolute nowness of this particular time; to comprehend the persistence of desire despite all that he has experienced. It brings him too, through two visits to the vicarage, to an understanding of the undeclared despair that can also dwell in this environment. All of what he relates in the book is told from the perspective of many years hence and so there is a sense that the entire story has gained a dusty layer of nostalgia and how could it not? It was a lovely month, spent in a beautiful, remote place, among gracious and complex people. It was, above all, a time that allowed for repair and, most unexpectedly, a time replete with possibility, even if little of it was realised back then.

Tom Birkin, a penurious Londoner in his early twenties, battered by war and a failed marriage, sought a fresh start for himself in the remote Yorkshire village of Oxgodby. He was excited by the prospect of uncovering and restoring a recently discovered medieval wall-painting in the village church. At less than 120 pages, A Month In The Country is a beautiful novella of restoration and healing. I was enchanted by the opening pages that showed Birkin arriving on a rainy evening, grudgingly received by the vicar, and bedding down in the bell-chamber of the church. From the window, he beheld \"the hills heaving like the back of some great sea-creature, dark woods washing down its sides into the Vale.\" There was an atmospheric beauty to the writing and humor in Birkin's observations of what was to be his home for a month in the country. On his first morning in Oxgodby, Birkin told himself, \"I was going to be happy, live simply\u2026\" Of his first real job, he declared, \"I willed it to be something good, really splendid, truly astonishing.\" His quiet optimism won me over.In this rural idyll that came close to a latter day Eden, Birkin was soon inducted into the social and religious life of the village. It was lovely to read of new friendship ties forged with the Ellerbeck family, Alice Keach (the vicar\u2019s wife), and Charles Moon (an outsider like Birkin himself on a different mission of uncovering a buried past). The hospitality of the village folks, Birkin's reluctant involvement in church life, often recounted with hilarity, made for delightful reading. Birkin's past was not delved into at any great length but just enough to shed light on his present quest for change. The story focused on the moments of discovery Birkin made that summer through the veil of sadness. He was \"surprised by joy\" but not in a religious sense. It was a restorative encounter conferred both by the calm haven found in nature and a wholly absorbing vocation. What truly delighted me was sharing Birkin\u2019s excitement as the lime wash was slowly stripped off the wall mural to reveal the masterpiece that had been shrouded in secrecy for some 400 years. Birkin recalled, \"And there I was, on that memorable day, knowing I had a masterpiece on my hands but scarcely prepared to admit it, like a greedy child hoards the best chocolates in the box.\" It was breathtaking. There was something magical too in Birkin\u2019s mystic sweet communion with the unknown artist.Read A Month In The Country by J. L. Carl. It is poignantly written and a veritable treat.

Carr is the representative author of Vonnegut's quote: \"Literature should not disappear up its own asshole, so to speak.\" (from Palm Sunday) - great books don't necessarily have to be written by MFA grads and life-long students of the craft. Carr didn't publish his first book until he was over 50; this novel wasn't published until he was 58. A life of observing the human condition for half a century was solid bedrock for his writing.A redemptive tale of the healing powers of both people, place and nature, this book is charming without being maudlin in a subject matter that could easily become so. I am loathe to accidentally impart any plot or character devices that are better experienced by the reading (and at such a small amount of page count, what do you have to lose?) - so I defer to the author and highly recommend this book to anyone.P.S. The Introduction is awesome, but I suggest reading it after you've completed the novel."}], "description": "In J. L. Carr's deeply charged poetic novel, Tom Birkin, a veteran of the Great War and a broken marriage, arrives in the remote Yorkshire village of Oxgodby where he is to restore a recently discovered medieval mural in the local church. Living in the bell tower, surrounded by the resplendent countryside of high summer, and laboring each day to uncover an anonymous painter's depiction of the apocalypse, Birkin finds that he himself has been restored to a new, and hopeful, attachment to life. But summer ends, and with the work done, Birkin must leave. Now, long after, as he reflects on the passage of time and the power of art, he finds in his memories some consolation for all that has been lost.", "title": "A Month in the Country", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60707.A_Month_in_the_Country", "average": 4.1, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388176690l/60707.jpg", "reviews": 855, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/34170.J_L_Carr", "name": "J.L.
