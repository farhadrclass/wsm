Marching to Zion may take its name from the hymn and end with two of the characters eventually entering Zion but this is a carefully constructed novel that covers a span of 20 years that examines relationships between black and white, Negro and Jew. Relationships that were forbidden then and to some extent not accepted by some now and all based on historical fact. From the labour/race riots in St Louis through to the Great Depression, the flooding of the Mississippi to the outbreak of war in Europe.Mags Preacher is a poor country girl that sets off for the big city of St Louis to make her way in the world, who has the luck to find a guide in Magnus Bailey who helps her find lodgings and in turn a trade at the funeral home owned by the Mr Fishbein, a European Jew who lives about with his daughter Minnie. Mags falls in love with his employee George McCullum, they get married and she is pregnant when he is killed in the race riots. Magnus Bailey and Fishbein move Mags back home to be with her family. They are moving on to Memphis to start a new life, and it becomes obvious to most that Minnie is in love with Magnus but they cannot be together due to each others\u2019 colour which is not acceptable in the south of the 1920s. He rejects her and goes away so as not to be found Minnie searches for him and does not come out of it well. It would be this forbidden love that drives the story forward.It would be so easy to give away the bulk of the story as it is such a brilliant tale that has been told by Mary Glickman, she is a fantastic story teller an art that is often forgotten. The characters are three dimensional real and faced with real dilemmas with no easy choices an excellent examination of American ideals in the early 20th century and how nobody was really free from the shackles of ages past. This really will become a modern classic."}, {"userName": "TAMMY CUEVAS", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2662412-tammy-cuevas", "userReview": "In 1916, Mags Preacher, an African-American young woman from the rural South, arrives in St. Louis hoping to learn a trade to better her future. There, she finds employment at Fishbein's Funeral Home and meets her husband-to-be. When Mr. Fishbein saves Mags' life, she leaves St. Louis with Mr. Fishbein and his young daughter, Minerva, whose mind was unbalanced when her family was killed in a pogrom in Eastern Europe. After Mags is reunited with her family, the Fishbeins and Magnus Bailey move on to Memphis. Minerva has always been in love with Magnus and cannot see that in the Jim Crow South of the early 20th century, their relationship would only end in grief. Marching to Zion is a story told in parts. The first part of the story features Mags and her life in St. Louis amid the race riots and discrimination of the time. We are also introduced to the Fishbeins and their tragic history. In the second part of the story, which makes up the majority of the novel, we follow the Fishbeins and Magnus Bailey as they travel together and separately. The racism of the time toward African-Americans and Jews is explored as the interracial couple seek a safe haven in which to live without fear.This is the first novel by Ms. Glickman that I have read, but will not be the last. Marching to Zion is one of the most gripping novels I have read in quite some time.5 starsDisclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the NetGalley book review bloggers program.

Marching to Zion tells the story of Minerva or Minnie Fishbein, a young woman with fiery red hair who lives in East St. Louis with her father, the owner of a funeral parlor in the black part of town. Minnie and her father escaped a pogrom in Eastern Europe and find refuge in East St. Louis until a group of bandits riot, killing and looting for days. Thanks to Fishbein's business partner and right hand man, Magnus Bailey, father and daughter live and are safely taken to Memphis, where they try to start anew.As Minnie grows up, she and Bailey fall in love. She sees no problem with their relationship, but as much as he wants to be with Minnie, he knows it will never work. In 1920s and 30s Memphis (or anywhere else in the US), a relationship between a black man and a white woman often ended up with a death or two. So Bailey leaves and breaks Minnie's heart. She sees no choice but to search for him. But soon after she runs away, she's brutally attacked. Minnie's life will never be the same again. She becomes lost to her father and to Bailey, the only two people who love her. What follows is thrilling story of betrayal and redemption. The characters in this book are human and sympathetic. I rooted for Minnie and Bailey throughout the book. Mary Glickman, as always, does a great job of portraying the South in the 1920s and 30s. Her first two books in this series featured biracial relationships with Jewish men and black women, but Marching to Zion does the opposite and centers around the relationship of Minnie and Bailey.I am sad to see this series finish with this book, but can't wait to see what Mary Glickman will come up with next!"}, {"userName": "Christoph Fischer", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13998364-christoph-fischer", "userReview": "\u201cMarching to Zion\u201d by Mary Glickman is a wonderful and sad story about interracial realtions in the 1910s and 1920 America.

Mary Glickman hides philosophy in the narrative as she has her characters discuss how experiences, both individual and group, influence how people react to various situations.\tThe story began in 1916 when Mags Preacher arrived in St. Louis from the small, country home where she grew up. Self-taught, she decided to become a hair stylist because most women want to look attractive and will pay for someone to help them achieve that goal. There was no one in her community providing that service to black women and she thought she could learn the trade through an apprenticeship. With the help of the dapper Marcus Bailey, she found a place to live and then a job at a mortuary where she met the other employee, George McCallum, who was also black. The funeral home was owned by Mr. Fishbein, a Jewish immigrant who lived upstairs in the building with his daughter, the beautiful, red haired beauty Minerva (Minnie) who had a horrendous temper. Mags is the primary character in the first section of the book. \tShe found life in the big city much different than life at home. Racial segregation, while not established by law, was prevalent because of entrenched custom. \tEventually, she was able to find her niche. Mags and George marry and have a daughter. They loved each other deeply and tried to fulfill the other\u2019s expectations. \u201cShe looked up at her husband in the way she had, full of admiration and trust. It seared his heart when she looked at him that way. On occasion, he gave detailed opinions on subjects he barely knew about, because he could not bear to disappoint her and risk lowering himself in her eyes. This time, he was sure of his answer.\u201d\tThe remainder of the book focuses on Bailey, Minerva, and Fishbein\tFishbein immigrated to St. Louis after a tragic life in Russia. A decent man, when he and Minnie arrive in St. Louis, Bailey carried Minnie down the gangplank when her father was having difficulty maintaining his balance while holding her. Minnie looked at him and said, \u201cDer shvartser has grine oygn.\u201d Fishbein replied, \u201cDer mensch has grine oygn.\u201d He immediately taught her to respect people for their actions not to label them because of their skin color.\tHe never forgot his personal history. Hearing the outbreak of a riot, Minnie asked her father what it was and he said, \u201cA pogrom.\u201d \u201cWhat is a pogrom?\u201d she asked. He responded \u201cA festival of evil. \t\tThe story got more complicated when Minnie fell in love with Bailey. He was reluctant to follow through even when he began to reciprocate her emotions because of their age difference and, more important, the racial divide. He left suddenly without explanation which threw Minnie into a massive downspin. \tBailey observed the way different people dealt with tragedy. Fishbein wondered if the tragedy that befell his people was the result of him disobeying one of the Ten Commandments, then thought, \u201cBut this is selfish, isn\u2019t it? To think that a world of suffering rains down on a multitude because of my sin.\u201d\tBailey \u201cdidn\u2019t fixate on his own people\u2019s miseries from the day they were captured in Africa and sold into slavery. He figured there was enough misery around day to day. Why wallow in the past? But Jews. If Fishbein were anything to go by, the past was their world entire.\u201d\tBailey considered moving to Paris, where several notable black Americans like Josephine Baker and Langston Hughes had settled thinking he found a way for a better life. Fishbein disagreed. \"When any man is in a fever like this, the thought, a fever of delusion, it\u2019s dangerous to argue.\u201d \t\"Magnus spoke of golden exile, but Fishbein knew better. There was no such thing. Exile was a ripping up, a tearing away, a flight from one set of evils to another.\" Fishbein recognized the continuing racism in the world: \"Magnus Bailey\u2019s people whose chains of iron had been loosed but never removed.\" Later, he would think of emigrating to Palestine as a way to have a better life.\tAnother character, Dr. Willie, thought Bailey was a threat in the pursuit of another woman, \u201cvowed revenge against the usurper Magnus Bailey. He was a small enemy, to be sure, but a large enemy can be turned to friendship when mutual gain is at stake, while a small enemy festers everlastingly looking for his chance.\u201d He also had set ideas about a woman\u2019s place. \u201cThat\u2019s the trouble...with a woman of independent means. They did things out of principle rather than need, which robbed a man like him of leverage.\"\tMARCHING TO ZION is the story of several tragedies as it tells the stories of simple people trying to survive in an often hostile environment. Most of it is realistic, if shocking at times. How Minnie reached her career choice isn\u2019t clear though the reasons for her temper tantrums is explained. The relationships among the characters, as well as the characters themselves and the situations they encounter, are complicated but explained.\tThe author has a somewhat unique writing style. Her sentences tend to be long, sometimes convoluted, but are understandable without having to reread them. She doesn\u2019t use quotation marks. Many of the characters speak with an accent but she indicates that by the judicious use of occasional words or phrases or incorrect verb tense.

She has never been inside much less seen a building 5 stories high, and she is in awe of the differences between where she was born and raised as opposed to where she now finds herself. She got to the city by hitching a ride on the back of a milk truck where she managed to fit herself among the canisters. What she wants to do in this new and bigger place is borrow money so she can learn to do hairdressing for black women, and after she has the knowledge she needs, she'll be able to open her own store. A chance meeting on the street with Magnus Bailey, a kind of entrepreneur of the day, was a real stroke of luck. She'd like him to loan her $100 so she can get started learning her trade. She offers Magnus 10% of her profits until the loan is repaid, and Magnus would get 10% of her profits for 6 months beyond that. Instead of loaning her the money she needs to start her business, Magnus gives her $10 and sends her to a rooming house where she can get reasonable lodging. Magnus believes she will be able to find a job and earn the $100 she needs.After several job interviews that did not pan out for her, Mags decides to apply for a job at a funeral parlor. George McCallum was the man in charge of most of the services the funeral home offered, and Mags was very impressed with how good George made the bodies look. She wanted him to teach her how to do that. Eventually Mags and George realize they love each other, so they marry, and both their lives are peacefully happy both at work and at home. Unfortunately, things change.The St. Louis riots take place followed by an outbreak of the Spanish Fever, and it becomes necessary for Mags to pack up the people who are family, whether or not they are related by blood, and move them all back to where Mags came from. Mags has a cousin, Aurora Mae, who lived in a place known as the Stanton House. Mags decided to stay there, but the former owner of the funeral home, Mr Fishbein, his daughter, Minerva, and Magnus Bailey continue their travels heading toward Memphis.From this point the stories of each of these people take turns none of them would have expected. Minerva has always been a troubled girl, and as she ages, she only becomes more and more unsettled as she cannot get what she wants for herself. It is at this point that the subjects of race and heritage become highly important to the characters in this story. Each of them deals with prejudice that ultimately affects their destiny. It is also at this point that the unfairness of such petty, by today's standards, differences lead to tragic consequences. Glickman does a superb job of letting the reader know exactly what the repercussions of being both Black and Jewish meant in this time frame, and it is heartbreaking. There is no level playing field for any of these people, but only one of them may be able to overcome what seems like an impossible, unsolvable burden. I labeled this book as a historic novel along with other tags, because Glickman has included some important historical events in her narrative. These events, such as the St. Louis Riots do not normally get much if any special attention in history books, and that is an unforgivable oversight. Glickman cleverly, through characters I had come to deeply care about, told the story from a deeply personal side of how this one event changed the lives of so many people. And the hardest part to accept is that this event never had to take place at all. I also was unaware that the answer to racial problems for people in this country could be resolved by going to Europe. This country was founded upon the right of freedom, yet a huge portion of the population could never have that unless they left the country committed to providing it. The same holds true for religious freedom. That was available so long as the person seeking such freedom was of the \"correct\" religion. Only for Jews the option of going to Europe posed larger difficulties than staying in the US did. While Glickman has addressed very heavy, important issues in her book, she did it all through very likable, very human characters. Nothing was so heavy handed as to appear one-sided. I thought Minerva, or Minnie, was such a good case in point. For me she embodied the stress and unfairness of the time in which she lived. Her fate was troubling.I received an ARC of this book from Open Road Media in exchange for an honest review. That in no way influenced my rating of 5 Stars for this book. In fact, I'd have given the book more stars if possible.

The story jumps from Mags to Magnus and then Minerva, back to Mags, to Aurora then back to Minerva. Such a huge cast of characters, all needing to tell their story. It begins interestingly enough, with a young country girl arriving in the big city with a dream. We meet Magnus, who runs a number of businesses with Fishbein, a Jew who owns, among other pursuits, a funeral home. Mags gets a job there, falls in love, has a child. Her husband is killed in a riot. Fishbein, his daughter Minnie, Mags, her child and Magnus all leave town. What follows is what seems like an odd wandering through time and Tennessee. Magnus discoveres that Minnerva(Minnie) has fallen for him. He runs from her with a lie. She discovers the lie, is terribly hurt by it and as a result runs off to become a prostitute and runs a highly favored house of il repute. At some point in the book Magnus realizes that he actually loves Minerva and runs off to find her, however having entrapped himself with Aurora, has to sneak around and make his way back to Minnie.There's a lot of time building up this illicit relationship and then it is... shall we say resolved... in a mere paragraph. I often feel like authors spend so much time avoiding a sagging middle that the end is an abrupt point at which the story simply drops off a cliff. Then things get all tied up and everyone's all better. As a point of grammatical contention, I get that some authors think the omission of quotation marks is artistic or symbolic or meaningful, but is such a distracting, horrible new trend and I really, as a book reader, would like it to stop. It pulls me right out of the story when I have to read a sentence twice to figure out if it's dialog or exposition. I'm trying not to let that weigh my decision to rate this book as three stars. A story of unrequited love between a Jewish woman and a black man sounds perfect on paper. I didn't relish the execution.

MARCHING is a standalone novel.MARCHING TO ZION is mostly about a white Jewish girl/woman and a black man who are doomed for, obviously, racial reasons. But the book doesn\u2019t begin with their story. It begins in 1916 with Mags Preacher, a black woman, who finds work at a funeral home and eventually marries her boss, the director there. The owner of the funeral home is a Russian Jew with a daughter who nowadays would be put on Ritalin. But they seem to be minor characters in a story about Mags.Then the story shifts. Now it concentrates on that daughter who should be on Ritalin, Minerva, and a black man, Magnus, who befriended her and her father from the time they got off the boat and entered the United States. The shift is smooth, somewhat like when a news broadcaster shifts from weather to hard news. Still, it was a shift even though Glickman doesn\u2019t leave Mags and her story entirely.This is an unusual structure, to begin with one story and shift to another. I thought it was a deliberate technique, the first story a sort of introduction to the second. It worked that way for me. But the shift could also signal Glickman\u2019s accidental brain freeze and then her decision to take this in an unplanned direction. But the second story works in part because it is Glickman\u2019s style to tell it from the various viewpoints of other characters. Readers learn their stories and may even care more about them than Minerva and Magnus.Safe prediction: there won\u2019t be a sequel. This book does not lend itself well to one.But my hope is that Mary Glickman becomes a more recognized author. And I think it\u2019s another safe prediction that she will.

I liked all of the characters in this story that examines racial and religious relationships and prejudice in Missouri and Memphis, in the early 1900s. At the centre of the novel is a white Jewish immigrant and his daughter, as well as a charismatic black American man, the three of whom have a long, rich, and complicated history, and are trying to map the direction of their future, if they can manage one together. I was sad to see that a character I really enjoyed, Mags, took a backseat in the novel after the first few chapters, but was heartened to learn that another black woman character, Aurora Mae, is a central character in another of Glickman's novels.

March to Zion takes us through the time period in this country from 1913 - 1936. Mary Glickman introduces is to some wonderfully colorful characters, from Mags Preacher who leaves the backwaters of Tennessee to find her fortune in the big city, St. Louis, to Magnus Bailey who also has found a flashy style that helps him escape his past. The other main characters are Fishbein, an elderly Jew, who has escaped the pogroms of Europe bringing a daughter Minerva to America to find freedom and happiness. We have all also have heard that African Americans did not have racial equality in the South all through the early 1900s. There were separate neighborhoods and even separate entrances to buildings. But many of us may not have known that life in United States was not always easy for Jews either. There was quite a bit of anti-semitisim. As we follow the lives of Fishbein and the people who swirl around his Funeral Home and in and out of his life, we see how being Jewish and interacting with people of color affects his and Minerva\u2019s lives.Historically acurate, March to Zion takes us through the events of the race riots of 1917 of East St. Louis, in which an outbreak of labor- and race-related violence caused between 40 and 200 deaths and extensive property damage.

Many, whose stories I would just become invested in, were then dropped or left me wanting to know much more about them. The first character introduced, Mags, we follow as she moves to the big city, finds a job, finds a husband, has a child and then lives through a traumatic event. All in the first 50 pages, then her character is dropped as the 'real' story starts. Mags isn't seen again till the very end of the book. Many of the story lines build then just trail off, until concluded with a one sentence wrap up later. This can be unsatisfying for a reader. The main love story, build and builds, only to come to a very dramatic climax in one short quick paragraph. Far to quick the primary characters of the book to be concluded.

They were not nearly as careful as they should have been. Even if she was a prostitute. It was a dangerous time for anyone thought to have had romantic feelings for a Black person (and the Black person in question). I don't know if I cared for either character. Minerva having fits (of rage?) The author tried to paint her as having a disorder (She did watch her family get murdered in the pogrom that killed Mr. Fishbeins whole family). Magnus just seem tortured. Roaming all over the country. He also seemed like the only Black person not scared to death of what him and Minerva felt for each other. I did like Fishbein's character. He was written as sad (and who wouldn't be? After what he went through?). But also as a fair, good person. The story tried to show how both Black and Jewish people were treated during that time. The characters of Pearl and Aurora Mae were also not big pieces of the story but I am looking forward to reading the authors other book in which Aurora Mae makes an appearance. Sad and abrupt (but probably fitting for the time) ending."}, {"userName": "Nicole Means", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12683156-nicole-means", "userReview": "There are a few reasons I ranked this book 4 stars. First, the author does not really develop the characters to a point that they are likable. Sure, I empathized with the characters, but I felt no real connection to any of them! Second, the author virtually omits Mags, whom I thought based on the jacket cover, was a major character in this story. She does not develop this character nor her daughter who was born in tumultuous times. The author alludes that the daughter grew up cold because of incidences surrounding her infancy, but we never learn about this baby's future. Finally, and this is trivial, but the author does not use quotation marks when separating the character's dialogue. I just found it annoying, and I had difficulty delineating between conversations and inner thoughts.However, these slight irritants did not stop my captivation with the narration. I found myself thinking of this book quite often and staying up into the wee hours of the night to read it. I enjoyed the story, although it saddened me until the very end. The author did not create perfect characters, but she did a great job of humanizing the impact of hatred and cruelty on society."}, {"userName": "Sandra", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17411885-sandra", "userReview": "The story opens with Mags Preacher coming to the big city to fulfill her dreams. The first person that Mags meets is Magnus Bailey. He helps her get a start, and she eventually ends up working at a funeral home owned by Mr. Fishbein. He and his strange daughter are the first Jews she has ever met. Her opinion of Jews changes when Fishbein saves her life during the race riots of 1917. As a matter of fact, lots of her ideas and circumstances change.However, the story is primarily about the unusual relationship between Bailey and Fishbein\u2019s strange and dangerous daughter. And it is not only the fact that Bailey is black and Minerva is white that makes their relationship different and dangerous during this time in history. From the race riots of 1917 and through the depression, their relationship changes. Is there hope for these two to have a life together?This book was exciting and kept my attention. The characters were very well developed, and I cared about them. This is a sad historical fiction.I was given a free copy of this book in exchange for an unbiased review."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14340518-amy", "userReview": "Marching to Zion is not one tragic love story but several all rolled into one very sad book. Whether losing their spouse to the pogroms in Estonia or the race riots of St. Louis, every main character in this book loses the person they love in a horrifying way.In spite of that, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It showed me a small glimpse of what life in the early 1900's would be like for a black man in love with a white woman, a Jewish man whose entire family was slaughtered, or a woman on her own who is entirely helpless. I love all of the characters in this book. I cried at all that they suffered and rejoiced for the small triumph for 2 of the characters at the end, hoping that life in Israel will be as kind to them as they deserve.I don't want to tell you the entire plot of the book. If that's what you want, you can read the Amazon summary or another review. I'm just going to tell you that if you can handle reading a book that is full of tragedy and sadness, read this book. If you're looking for a light beach read, this isn't it."}, {"userName": "Jennifer G", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32093728-jennifer-g", "userReview": "I really didn't think this book was going to be that good. It seems strange that I would read a book that I had such low hopes for, but I was in a rush at the library and didn't want to leave without a book for the week.It turns out that I really liked this book. I can't put my finger on what it was that I liked so much. It might have been the writer's style; it might have been the unique story. But I definitely liked the book and would recommend it.The main characters in the book are either white and Jewish, or black. The book is set back in time from 1916 to 1936, and follows the characters as they struggle with racism and hardship. Yet the story isn't all doom and gloom, and maintained my interest until the last page."}, {"userName": "Pamela", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5807970-pamela", "userReview": "This one is high on my list. The story was well-told with multiple narrators with distinct voices. The writing held my attention, and there were plenty of themes for book club discussion: Society's rules, hatred, resilience, bad fortune, dignity, interracial relationships, and the imprinting of first love.This book made me think of the big and small betrayals people commit in the name of love and/or passion, the way we delude ourselves and use each other, and the ways in which we work hard (and often fail) to honor our commitments to people with whom we have soul-connections. This story also shined a spotlight on how money corrupts love, how it drives men to evil acts."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6069769-rachel", "userReview": "As a fan of Mary Glickman's previous novel, it was fun to revisit familiar characters (like Aurora Mae) and settings (the south before and after the Great Flood). However, in Marching to Zion, I just really didn't get her character of Minnie and found it hard to relate, feel empathy, and root for her and Magnus (like I did with Aurora Mae and Bernard in One More River and Jackson and Katherine in Home in the Morning). Nevertheless, an interesting, highly readable novel, with a totally surprising and unexpected ending, that I recommend especially if you read and enjoyed her others. However, I still like Home in the Morning the best!"}, {"userName": "Sharie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6750553-sharie", "userReview": "Hx Theme: combination of race relations and anti-semitism; very well intertwined and comparedI love how the focus winds from character to character, without feeling like you've abandoned the first one.Excellent and appropriate ending.

They were all inter-related, but it was just weird. It also lost a lot of steam as it went along, and I started losing interest. I stuck with it, mainly to see if it ever got back to the original character and it really didn't although she was mentioned.

Anyone who believes in romance will not love the ending, those inclined to Karma will understand at once. Marching to Zion is very prophetic, it's lack of punctuation at times is confusing but adds to the rush of emotion it produces. This novel says a lot about the ideal of freedom, it's boundaries, and illusion.
