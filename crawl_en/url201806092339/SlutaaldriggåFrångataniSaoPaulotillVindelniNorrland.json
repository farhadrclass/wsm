Honest, emotional, compelling. Perhaps for the first chapter, I didn't get into the flow of this book. The writing seemed stilted, unemotional, cold descriptions of a child's memories. Then, suddenly, I tumbled into the author's world headlong, completely engrossed and not wanting to put the book down. The narrative shifts among time, place, and mood beautifully. It shows the determination to survive as a street kid in Brazil, and the culture shock of a sudden uprooting to a new family and new home in Sweden. The book is rich with life's moments that resonate worldwide: poverty, wealth, abuse, kindness, violence, tenderness, death, life, despair, and hope. The recurring theme of mothering and the strength of friends was both touching and hauntingly sad in turns. The tale the author tells us not an easy one. She lays herself bare, sharing even the most horrific moments and nightmares of her life, and the (quite literally) soaring heights as well. Were this an American memoir, it would include references to PTSD and therapy to cope - understandable, and no shame in either. Here the author finds her own techniques, including using her experiences to help others. Kudos to her for sharing her tale and using it for positive change. I will be rereading this, as I'm sure my rapid fire swiping reading to find out what would happen next caused me to miss some of the richness and elegance of the text. The translator also deserves mention - were it not for names I'm unused to reading, I would have thought I was reading it in the language it was written in. Nicely done."}, {"userName": "Iso Melo", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63324097-iso-melo", "userReview": "As a Brazilian, one year younger than the author, I need to clarify some points. I understand her pain and her suffering, but as she was a kid, she did not understand the historical and economic context. In the end of 80s, Brazil faced one of the worst economic crisis of the History of Economy. Until that moment, it was the second worst of the History (compared to Germany after First World War). Inflation reached more 1000% per month and we were the most unequal country of the world. I am white and privileged and I remember moments that I wanted to have milk and there was no milk. Old houses in Brazil have a room named \"dispensa\". It is used to stock food in crisis. I have the impression I remember watching the stepmother of my mother paying food with gold (GOLD!). I've also been exposed to similar levels of violence as the author had (for example, watched little friends die without medical aids, because they were poorer than me, there was no public medical assistance and nobody would pay for them).My family and my relatives have never abandoned me (when State doesn't protect you, your \"tribal\" relationships do). I am very grateful for them because of that. As the author and her mother were abandoned by their family and relatives (they don't seem to be poor Brazilians, poor Brazilians don't have appartments and houses), and she was black and poor (what make things much worse), they became the most fragile part of a society where things like, finding food and having medical assistance was a challenge to all social classes. They suffered more. But the nightmares of 80s ended. Brazil is a completely different country since 1994. We have many serious problems, but not those problems Christina describes in her book. Foreigners don't understand that quite well. They still believe we are living in the end of 80s. And this book doesn't contribute to change this idea."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5793497-amanda", "userReview": "An incredibly honest memoir and interestingly told going back and forth between Christina as a child in Brazil (where her name was Christiana) and as an adult Christina going back to Brazil from Sweden to try to find her birth family.

I don't think any travel would give us a more accurate idea of what real life is like for such unfortunate children. The author writes her story by alternating the periods in her life. One chapter takes place in her childhood in Brazil, and the next one takes place with her adopted family in Sweden. This alternating does not make it difficult to comprehend, in actuality, the alternating helps us really feel the culture shock she went through. I loved this story, but I cried through much of it.Kudos also to the translator, because this book never feels as if it were written in any language other than English.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to open their mind to the realities of growing up poor. While the U.S. does have a limited amount of social safety nets, I believe poverty-stricken families in this country are not so far removed from the hardships faced by the impoverished of Brazil."}, {"userName": "Sandra Dickenson", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64060180-sandra-dickenson", "userReview": "Provoking readThis Amazon selection was well worth my time. Outstanding translation. Written in the first person, the author made me feel I was with her in the isolated cave and the crowed inner city streets. This is a straightforward, raw and honest recollection of what she endured in her childhood and how it influenced what she now does as an adult. She's a professional speaker who brings awareness of and solutions to children living in poverty. Not the welfare-food stamps of industrial societies, but of those countries with no safety nets. Where children fend for themselves until they are old enough to be used for another purpose- menial labor or worse. Her hope is to bring them an opportunity to become loving adults. She learns at a young age that good people do bad things to survive and that being forced into survival mode is justification for wrongdoing. I can't help compare that to the TV show Survior where it is OK for people to lie, steal and deceive in order to be the only Survivor (an awarded title). We recognize that when the TV show ends, the person does not live life that way in the real world because underneath it all they are \"good\". It is only the experience of surviving that leads to justified wrongdoing. Christiana makes us think of the why. Why, when bad people do those same bad things is it judged differently? When the only purpose of a crime is to inflict pain and suffering? Before this, I was reading a Holocaust survivor book. It also portrayed situations where good people doing bad things were justified while those doing bad things for the sake of cruelty where not justified. Can a society intervention help? Should we intervene? When? Do we have an obligation to help children even when it means prying them away from the arms of their beloved parent? At least one critic points out that Brazil of the 1980's no longer exists. That social programs are now the norm. I think though, the greater issue is that this scenerio will always exist somewhere. We have pockets of children living in this type of poverty somewhere. Does it really matter how prolonged and how extreme the poverty is? Don't we adults have an obligation to help these children?"}, {"userName": "Meg Leader", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38184412-meg-leader", "userReview": "I got this book through Amazon Prime First, or whatever the program is called.

Trata-se igualmente da busca por algo que Critina acredita estar perdido no passado, no Brasil, quase esquecido da mesma forma como a l\u00edngua portuguesa para ela.No percurso para o qual Cristina nos conduz, intercalam-se diferentes momentos de sua vida. Os cap\u00edtulos nos mostram sua inf\u00e2ncia, vivendo em uma caverna e sobrevivendo a muito custo nas cercanias de Diamantina, a vida nas ruas de S\u00e3o Paulo, a viol\u00eancia, as mortes, o amor e a educa\u00e7\u00e3o para a vida que sua m\u00e3e lhe transmitiria diariamente.

The story about a young girl from the Brazilian favela who is adopted by a Swedish family is unusual (at least for me, an American reader). Kindle first books are often hit-or-miss, and this is no exception.What I liked: Through this story, I got to see and experience the favela and the caves as well as life in modern-day Sweden. I particularly enjoyed how the author describes her experiences as a child would see and understand them. Certain aspects an adult would care about (like hygiene) are not even noticed, since a child wouldn't care about them. Others, like games and candy and fights, are described in great detail. There's a lot little Christiana does not understand, and a lot no child should experience. I also give credit to the translator. I know nothing about Swedish, but the language in this book came across as perfectly colloquial American English. There were no glitches or stops; I had no need to work hard to follow what was being said.What I didn't like: There is a lot of repetition, and a lot of \"I had so many emotions flowing through me\"-type sentences. This book could do with a good bit of editing, something I've noticed in other Kindle first books.Still, I learned a lot and found parts of it very interesting. I hope Rickardsson will be able to follow her dream and find ways to help children like her."}, {"userName": "Harry", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23627583-harry", "userReview": "What a tragic book! It is not only tragic because a little girl had to grow up living in caves and the Brazilian favela (slum) and being desperate enough to kill for half-eaten food that was thrown in the garbage. It is also tragic that the experience left Christina so emotionally scarred that she couldn't accept love in her new home in Sweden.When it comes to Mamae in Brazil vs. Mama in Sweden, the former wins hands down even though Mamae was mentally ill and could not provide the necessities of life. Till Lili-ann's dying day, Christina could never tell her adoptive mother that she loved her. Her adoptive father, Sture, is barely mentioned. I feel bad for the adoptive parents; they certainly did not get what they bargained for.The author glosses over the fact that she seems ungrateful to be adopted and lead a \"normal\" life in Sweden. The adoption saved her from a life of extreme destitution, malnourishment, disease, violence, glue sniffing and the strong possibility of death - just like her father, her brother and several of her acquaintances. Unlike millions of other \"street rats,\" Christina was lucky enough to be whisked away to the other side of the globe where none of these problems exist. Yet all she does is moan about the fact that she didn't understand why she and Mamae may never see eachother again. I might accept these feelings in a 7 year old, but when they are still percolating in a 30-something adult, something is wrong.The subtitle, \"A Memoir of Finding a Home Across the World,\" says it all. The book is about Christina's quest of finding her biological family in Brazil. Yet tragically she could never find a home across the world in Sweden.The book is not especially well written (or translated), and it gets rather preachy toward the end.

Christina/Christiana makes it clear you can't really escape the big influences on your life. I am proud of her for continuing on and confronting these tough memories. I got the most out of the childhood memories she included in this book. I also got a lot from her self analysis of what was important to her at those times or what she was thinking or how she still feels. I got less from some sections that I felt were repetitive, sections that were hard to get through for various reasons. I found myself rushing through those parts that seemed out if pace to me to hurry on to the continuation of her story about what poverty was like, what the people were like and most notably the reaction of those who think they can imagine such conditions (although they really cannot) and how to revisit all this many years later.

Om uppv\u00e4xten i Sverige och alla kulturkrockar som uppstod n\u00e4r hon kom till det lilla samh\u00e4llet i Norrland. Hur hon har bearbetat sina upplevelser i vuxen \u00e5lder och b\u00f6rjat bygga upp ett nytt liv. Och n\u00e4r hon beh\u00f6ver fylla p\u00e5 med kraft och energi har hon ett speciellt knep: Hon kastar sig ut fr\u00e5n ett flygplan och faller fritt i sextio sekunder innan fallsk\u00e4rmen vecklas ut. Att landa p\u00e5 f\u00f6tterna \u00e4r bra att kunna i m\u00e5nga sammanhang! Det h\u00e4r \u00e4r en ber\u00e4ttelse om k\u00e4rlek, sorg, v\u00e4nskap och f\u00f6rlust. Christina ber\u00e4ttar om att \u00f6verleva, om hur vitt skilda v\u00e4rldar har format henne och hur hon har k\u00e4mpat f\u00f6r att f\u00e5 ihop sina tv\u00e5 jag.", "title": "Sluta aldrig g\u00e5 - Fr\u00e5n gatan i Sao Paulo till Vindeln i Norrland", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31111462-sluta-aldrig-g---fr-n-gatan-i-sao-paulo-till-vindeln-i-norrland", "average": 4.0, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1468403076l/31111462.jpg", "reviews": 166, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15481024.Christina_Rickardsson", "name": "Christina Rickardsson"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Autobiography", "Biography"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31111462-sluta-aldrig-g---fr-n-gatan-i-sao-paulo-till-vindeln-i-norrland", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38903201-never-stop-walking", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36604956-never-stop-walking", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36192458-nunca-deixe-de-acreditar---das-ruas-de-s-o-paulo-ao-norte-da-su-cia", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40496387-nunca-deixe-de-acreditar"]}
