I think I might be in love with Susanna Kearsley. I read The Rose Garden earlier this year, and being a huge fan of time travel, devoured that shit like it was going out of style. Granted, it took me a little while to get into it because I found the pacing in the beginning to be kind of slow, but after getting over that bump in the road, there was no turning back.The Winter Sea was a whole different beast for me. This one grabbed onto my imagination much sooner and I found I really couldn't put it down. I read until I could no longer keep my eyes open, allowed myself four and a half hours of sleep, then woke and picked it right back up to finish it. I then experienced something I don't experience often; as anxious as I was to get to the end and find out what happened, I kept putting it down and waiting. It sounds insane, but I wasn't looking forward to the ending. Not because I feared it would be bad, but because I didn't want it to end at all. I wanted to just keep reading about Sophia and John and Carrie and Graham, and when it was finally over, I wanted to cry. There, again, was another complicated mess, as the ending left me feeling both happy and sad. The way Kearsley weaves her tales together is absolutely captivating to me, and I will forever be jealous of her ability to craft a compelling tale. I don't want to give anything away in this review, so I will just say that it was refreshing to see a hero from the past being selfish and claiming the woman he loves (who also loves him) instead of trying to \"spare\" her by keeping away. That path always leads to trouble in a story, so I've come to recognize it as a lazy and tired device. I might be a bit biased regarding this book considering my own genealogy traces back to several prominent Scottish families, but even those who have no Scottish in them at all should be able to appreciate the compelling, history-rich atmospheres Kearsley is capable of creating. The character voices are real and rich with emotion, the intrigue is well done, and Kearsley put in so many historical facts that this wonderful fiction also acts as a sort of history lesson. Let's face it, the conflicts between England and Scotland (especially those regarding the Stuart kings) are not easy to navigate, but Kearsley managed it with aplomb, giving life to these too-oft faceless historical figures so that it became a real story, not just dry facts from a history book. She will forever have my gratitude for helping to make sense of it all.If you like romance, I think you'll like this book. If you like history, I think you'll like this book. If you're into political intrigue, there might be something here for you. If you're a genealogist, this will speak to you. If you're a genealogist with ties to Scotland, you'll definitely like this. And if, like me, you're all of the above? Sit back, enjoy, and be prepared to want to read it again as soon as you're finished."}, {"userName": "Lauren Fidler", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2072335-lauren-fidler", "userReview": "i have what can only be described as a love-hate relationship with this book. i found so much of it to feel incredibly stupid and yet i couldn't put it down. explain that one to me!'warning: here there be spoilers. 10 Things I Hate About You:1. the employment of a frame story - i'm pretty sure the conversation with her editor went something like this: sk: it's going to be two books in one! one story will be set in modern day and the other will be her \"historical\" novel!editor: oh, you mean, like a frame story?sk: no! it's two stories set in one!gah. okay, i get that she wanted to tell these two stories and intertwine them, blahblahblah. but what starts off being about carrie mcclelland, famed historical novelist, turns quickly into the tale of sophia, abandoned orphan extraordinaire. the carrie bits soon turn into annoying interruptions that comprise of key moments like putting the kettle on or ignoring her breakfast of toast so that we don't forget about her when the book voices take over.2a. protagonist as author - i HATE this device. so much. it frosts my cookies in ways you can't even begin to comprehend. it feels like a total copout - and, yeah, i get it, you write what you know, but this isn't her first book. you know what i'm sayin'?2b. protagonist as obvious incarnation of writer - this is sort of a subset of number #2. kearsley was a poli-sci major (or something) as is her carrie mclelland. at one point, there is a conversation between carrie and her scottish beau about professors and books and how she hates literature courses because she doesn't go in for all that analyzing and crap. well, screw you, too, carrie. some of us like that about our books and when you espouse your theories about how fiction is emotive and should not be subject to analysis, you isolate a population that does, in fact, read fiction for the little details. 3. the writing - while for the most part, it's decent, there are moments that make the reader cringe. the conclusion of the sophia plotline ends with the trite sentiments of \"coming out of winter and finding their spring\" - or some such nonsense. gag me. i need that blatant bullshit like i need a hole in my head.4. you say \"DNA genetic memory,\" i say \"functioning schizophrenic\" - the sideplot with dr. weir is so underdeveloped and stupid, it's hardly worth mentioning. but i have to. carrie gets possessed by the ghosts of family past and they propel her to write her latest novel. she, being completely rational, sees a local doctor/history buff and asks him if her DNA could remember details about her ancestors' lives. no joke. you know what? the woman claims to hear voices, claims that the voices possess her and tell their stories through her literature. that doesn't sound like genetic memory to me. just sayin'.5. what's in a name - at one point, the editor in the book points out that there are characters who share the same name and that carrie should change the names to avoid confusion. this appears to be some sort of bizarrely meta moment that kearsley uses to explain why she isn't changing the names. there are two kirstys, two grahams, a stuart and many stewarts, several hamiltons, more dukes than you can shake a stick at...i don't know. i kept them straight, but i really wished i didn't need to expend the energy to do so.6. the graham factor - every heroine needs a hero. at least in historical fiction written for straight women. in the modern book, it's graham. and he's fine. but very one note. in fact, there is so little \"character development\" in the frame story at all that it is difficult to understand how carrie and graham end up together so damn fast despite some weird \"magnetic pull\" that exists between them. if a guy ever told me that i was \"his the moment he first saw\" me...i'd call the cops.7. where's the beef (part one) - there is a ton of history here, but it is presented tangentally. what i mean is, instead of witnessing epic battles and fights, all the historical information comes courtesy of history professors, history buffs, or conversations between characters. kearsley tells, she doesn't show. and perhaps she wanted to focus on the romances, instead, but that leads me to...8. where's the beef (part two) - the romances also seem to happen in long glances or brief conversations. she skirts over the sex, the birth, and, well, the love. you know what isn't really romantic to me? when characters wake up next to someone, get up, get dressed, and go to work. sorry. doesn't really do it for me.9. what the dickon? - when i was little, my all-time favorite book was The Secret Garden. i ate that shit up. and i loved dickon, but i couldn't understand half of what he said because of his thick, indecipherable, regional dialect. everything was wick. and there were lots of vowels and apostrophes. now, imagine a book where every other character is a dickon, not in characterization, but in language. and you'll ken fit i say.10. incest is...best? - so...in the final moments of the book...after a predictable conclusion to both tales, by the way...carrie is lying in bed next to grahamcracker and thinking about how his steely grey eyes remind her so much of moray's...and then she puts it all together in the creepiest \"a ha!\" moment i've read in awhile. sophia and moray have a daughter which sophia leaves behind at slains, a little girl who thinks she is the daughter of a fishermen, who has, presumably her own children and her own line of descendants. then, she thinks about her own fate - how moray became mcclelland and how they reproduced and had their own descendants as mclellands. and dawn breaks over marblehead and she thinks about the interconnectivity of their blood lines and SMILES joyfully as she cuddles up next to her kin. you know what wouldn't make me smile? realizing that i'm several generations back related to the man i'm sleeping with. genetics be damned; that shit is too close for comfort. Taming of the Shrew:1. I couldn't put this book down. I couldn't. I wanted to read it and could read huge chunks of it in barely no time at all. I can't explain it. Maybe my ancestors possessed me so that I could read this one faster than Carrie could write it?3 stars - a good book in some ways, but horribly flawed in others."}, {"userName": "Lisa Kay", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2459470-lisa-kay", "userReview": "[ The thing that I felt was left unfinished was the motivations of James Douglas Graham, 4th Duke of Hamilton.

I did not rate this book after reading it because I was so upset about the ending, but in retrospect I have to allow that it was one of the best books (and perhaps THE BEST) I have read this year. While I am VERY stingy about 5 star ratings and this is NOT the HEA I would have chosen, I confess that the author's meticulous research, beautiful prose, and riveting parallel storyline has won me over in the end. I've decided to give it the 5 stars after all.WHERE OH WHERE DO I POSSIBLY BEGIN?????OK. With the beginning- I was in LOVE with this book. Absolutely enthralled with it - the writing style, the dual plot lines, the historical accuracy - truly enamored. I found it so easy to relate to Carrie in her methodical and thorough research for her historical novel and her deisre to get the tiniest details right. I enjoyed the beginnings of romance with the Keith brothers, and I immediately sympathized with the characters in Carrie's novel. As it turns out, I am one of probably very few people who already had a very thorough knowledge of the Franco-Scottish plans in 1708 and the subsequent Jacobite risings and can say that the author was spot on with historical accuracy. I admire and respect how she was able to work so many true characters and events into the story in such an engaging fashion... HOWEVER... About 80% into the book, things take a bad turn and there is a particular detail of this that spoiled the entire book for me. Although there is a rather contrived HEA (one that I actually saw coming) the female protagonist does something that caused me to become completely alienated from her emotinally and I found I could never feel sympathy or respect for her from that moment on. Since I do not believe in \"plot-spoiling\" reviews, but try very hard to just give my thoughts on a book, I won't reveal what that \"moment\" was. Suffice to say, however, I felt the action was so far out of character that I had a hard time believing in the ultimate HEA. It was also so far removed from my own nature that I could not relate to it. I then found myself reading the rest of the book with an uncharacteristic detachment and just flipping pages to see how it would all be resolved. This should have been/could have been a 5 star review but I am so conflicted about the resolution that I refuse to rate it."}, {"userName": "Ira", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17838248-ira", "userReview": "I\u2019m glad in this \u2018self published and write anything you want\u2019 times, there are still author like Ms. Kearsley.

I really wish I could have given this book a 2.5. It was better than okay, but not much. I really disliked the plot device of cutting back and forth from the 18th to the 21st century. When the 18th century story started to get interesting, the story would revert to the 21st century. The contemporary part of the story was dull and I didn\u2019t care about the characters. The use of \u201cgenetic memory\u201d as a plot device didn\u2019t justify the jarring lack of continuity either. However, what bothered me the most was the lack of character development. The author did a tremendous amount of historical research, and it shows in her meticulous attention to accuracy. Yet, most of the details concerned atmospherics, the flow of events, and fidelity to the historic record, but didn\u2019t add depth to our understanding of the characters. I didn\u2019t feel like she had gotten into anyone\u2019s skin and portrayed a richly lived experience.

Though I am always interested in history of any kind, my particular interests range from ancient Egypt, it\u2019s ties to ancient Rome, and how that all eventually leads to England before it was England, across the sea to the Danes and the Northmen, and back again to England, Scotland and Ireland. What fascinates me most is how the influences of all these great people through history still dictate so very much of what we do today. How history repeats itself again and again and again. Though I still have not quite sorted out The War of the Roses and that family mess, I\u2019m getting there.So here I find myself, with a type of novel I have held no particular interest in for quite some time, a romance, that is saved by its historical context, and a touch of magic, or science, depending on how you look at it. And though I have no particular urge to go on a romance read-a-thon, it was a very welcome reading-slump-buster.This is really two stories in one. The first is that of Carrie, a historical fiction writer, who wants to tell the story of James Stewart, whose throne was stolen from him and his Jacobite supporters, especially Nathaniel Hooke. She\u2019s been attempting to write in France at the palace of St Germain where Stewart lived in exile, but finds no inspiration there. On a chance visit to her agent in Scotland, she stumbles upon Slains Castle, and hears the voices of her characters finally come to life. As she writes, she discovers many details are history, with not a shred of fiction.We are also given access to the story she is writing, and the chapters frequently alter between past and present. The story she writes is of Sophia, who finds herself in the household of the Countess of Errol, a staunch Jacobite. This is the story that really stole the show though I hadn\u2019t expected it to. Sophia is not an active player in the Jacobite uprisings, merely a passive observer for the most part, but her story is both joyful and tragic, enchanting and haunting. I ripped through these pages as I cannot recall having done in months.The romance is told beautifully. There are no sex scenes (they merely fade to black) and I think perhaps that is the most appealing aspect of the entire novel. It allowed the romance itself to take center stage and truly be felt by the reader. Though I could not tell you much about the truth of these events as the author has written them, I was impressed by the afterword (which I always read!) and it seemed to me that she had done very thorough research and perhaps even included a couple of the locals of Cruden Bay in Carrie\u2019s story.The writing was superb, even if the Doric speech was almost untranslatable to my eyes. But it is Scotland and it lent the story a great deal of authenticity.I will definitely be checking out Kearsley\u2019s other works in the future (I\u2019ve been eyeing The Firebird for awhile) and would heartily recommend this to fans of historical romance and certainly to fans of Outlander and Diana Gabaldon."}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2411388-hannah", "userReview": "Re-read 2/22/13Just as excellent the second time around.Now to dive into The Firebird :DOriginal ReviewFrom the onset of Susanna Kearsley's, The Winter Sea, fate clearly plays a large part in the destiny of writer Carrie McClelland, as well as the novel she is researching on the unsuccessful Jacobite uprising of 1708. A detour to Slains Castle on the rugged west coast of Scotland solidifies Carrie's desire to move her base of operations there. After meeting with her agent and good friend, Jane, Carrie finds and settles into her new digs at a cottage in Cruden Bay - a cottage with a magnificant view of Slains Castle in the distance.Immediately, vivid and strange, half-remembered dreams of another woman haunt her sleep, and make her computer keyboard keys fly with reams of storyline that these dreams produce. Carrie slowly submerges herself in the story of her ancestor, Sophia Paterson; a woman who was initially no more then a name in Carrie's family tree.As the days go by, and the dreams intensify, Carrie comes to realize that Sophia's story is no longer a figment of her writer's imagination, but a real echo of Sophia's life in 1708 Scotland. In addition, Carrie's own life begins to mirror Sophia's.******The Winter Sea is a solid, historically replete novel featuring everything I've come to expect and admire from writer Susanna Kearsley:- Realistic characters you grow to like and relate to.- An intriguing storyline that maintains it's voice and consistancy throughout.- An understated love story without gratuitous sex or cheesy dialog.- A well researched historical novel that teaches and informs the reader without overwhelming them with dry facts and boring details.Kearsley's got a real talent for writing, and I don't mind admitting she has become one of my favorite new writers with a skill on par with the likes of Mary Stewart or Daphne duMaurier IMO.A solid 5 star book."}, {"userName": "Limonessa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4147373-limonessa", "userReview": "[I am wondering why Sophia and Moray did not go to get back Anna from Kirsty's sister.

But the ending was just bad. I can't understand/relate to a husband and wife who would just abandon their baby to another family like that. Sure, sure, it was \"all the family she'd ever known\", but she's TWO. She never should have been given to them in the FIRST place, but hells sakes, get your kid! Not to mention, I can't relate to this in the circumstances in MY day and age, back then there would be a HUGE difference her growing up in her foster family of servants vs her being raised by her real family who are related to dukes and earls and have favor with the Queen. You are depriving her of all opportunity AND knowing her own LOVING family, for what? Ridiculous. It really bothered me and made me clutch my own baby tighter as I read it. Also, I can enjoy a good history lesson, but the way she droned on and on about the history of the region was hard to read. SHOW me. Don't TELL me. Don't list facts to me for pages on end with no reference to any real characters in the book. Although, I fear this stems from Ms. Kearsley not being too gifted of a writer. There were several conversations that took place that instead of actually having any dialogue she would just write about what a \"dance\" it was, and how many \"twists and turns\" the conversation took. Once again, SHOW me, don't TELL me. Or when the main character receives a letter from her love, I was looking forward to her getting some privacy to read it and instead the author just says that it 'comforted her every night when she read it' (paraphrasing).

This is a classic case of the right book finding the right time. I know I've picked this book up several times with the intent to read it and it just didn't look all that compelling. Nothing really grabbed me about it beyond the cover, I didn't really know much about that historical period, and I'm not really a person who reads romance novels regularly. I'd read a kind of heavy, dark book though and needed something light. A friend recommended something short that was perfect. I enjoyed it, but wanted something still on the light side but longer. She suggested this one and this book finally found its time. This book has two parallel storylines. One is in the present, and the other is in the early 18th century, both in Scotland, by the sea. Reasons to read this book:-This is an escape read, you'll be immersed quickly. -You won't wanna put the book down. -Both storylines are equally appealing, and you'll really care about the characters. -It's all about relationships. Relationships of all kinds. -If you're into genealogy, you'll love this book. -Both male leads are hard to resist. :)-If you've always wanted to write a book, this is great, because she really gets you into the mind of an author as she's creating a story that takes off in her mind. -The audio narration by Rosalyn Landor was very well done. She got the Scottish accents almost too perfect, they were a bit hard to understand at times, but mainly this was one character with a minor role who had a very deep accent. The others were easy to understand. She did a great job of changing from female to male voices! At times, it was hard to believe a woman read the whole book. I know this is a book I will never forget. If you can get through this book without crying, you may not be totally human! I really enjoyed it, and thanks to everyone who encouraged me to read this.

I added her name to my list of authors to check out awhile back and I've spent the intervening time idly wondered whether the enticing comparisons to the likes of Mary Stewart had some merit. Not long ago I decided THE WINTER SEA would be the perfect maiden voyage with Kearsley. Published a couple of years ago in the UK, the U.S. edition was slated to come out December 1st and I added it to my Christmas list in the hopes it might find its way inside my stocking this year. Happily, I was not disappointed and I have my mother to thank for that--another die-hard Mary Stewart fan herself. So I picked it up the night after Christmas and settled in to see what all the fuss was about. Well, it quickly became crystal clear to me why people love her work. THE WINTER SEA is the perfectly captivating kind of historical fiction that casts its spell over you from page one and doesn't let go until all is eloquently said and done.Carrie McClelland is a famous writer of historical fiction. She works best in isolation and frequently travels to the destinations featured in her novels to absorb the local flavor and engage in primary research for the events, history, and people that make up her stories. After an extended period in France, frustrated with the lack of progress she's making on her current manuscript, Carrie agrees to take a break to attend the blessing of her agent's newborn baby in Scotland. On her way up the coast, she stumbles across the ruins of a beautiful castle as she stops to ask for directions. Something about the place seems to call to her. She longs to stay but convinces herself to continue on to her friend's house. Little does she know she'll be returning to Cruden Bay very soon indeed as Castle Slains plays a pivotal role in her chosen tale set during the oft-overlooked Jacobite rebellion of 1708. On the advice of her agent, and the ethereal tugs she continues to feel herself, Carrie rents a tiny cottage on the coast and settles in to let the muse have her way with her. But the closer she delves into the history of Slains, the deeper she is drawn into the lives of its long-dead inhabitants. The characters of her story begin to take on a life of their own and Carrie is no longer sure what is fact and what is fiction as she rushes to get down all the images and conversations bombarding her on a daily basis.What a beautiful and engrossing story! I'm awfully fond of historical fiction set during any of the Jacobite rebellions. Ever since reading Jennifer Roberson's excellent Lady of the Glen several years ago, I've found the time period and subject matter fascinating, if incredibly bittersweet. This story is no exception. The narrative alternates between the present day and the events leading up to and following the failed rebellion in 1708. Though the story and characters in the past start out as Carrie's own creation, she uses one of her own ancestors as her heroine, and in doing so unwittingly forges a bridge of shared memory between them. The results are unexpected and truly riveting. I never knew for sure which way the chips would fall and whether or not the novel as a whole would cross over into a supernatural/time travel extravaganza a la Outlander or if there would be a less outlandish explanation for the unfathomable link between these two women. I won't spill the beans here, but will say that I was very pleased (and relieved) at the outcome and heartily approve of the deft manner in which Ms. Kearsley handled both the slightly fantastical element to her story as well as the two primary relationships flourishing therein. I initially thought I would get bored with the ancestor Sophia's story, as I was immediately so caught up in Carrie's present-day tale. But that worry quickly fled as I eagerly looked forward to each switch of narration to find out how my other people were faring. Carrie's growing relationship with a very endearing local history lecturer had me at hello and Sophia's perilous and earnest attachment to a young Scottish soldier had me on the edge of my seat. In retrospect, I do wish we'd gotten a more extended resolution for Carrie and her suitor, but overall I closed the book extremely satisfied with the way the relationships concluded. THE WINTER SEA will appeal in spades to fans of Mary Stewart and Diana Gabaldon. And, not to annoy any Outlander fans out there but I, for one, infinitely prefer Kearsley's reserved and resonant touch to the the rampant floridity of Gabaldon's epic.

Two stories that I found to be equally addicting. I couldn't put this down. I've shed actual tears reading this. It's full of romance and heartbreak. Susanna Kearsley proves that you can have a wonderful romantic story without containing dirty sex scenes.

I liked  Every Secret Thing enough to want to read more of Kearsley\u2019s work. This novel has dual time lines. There is a contemporary narrative, told in the first person. The narrator is an author writing a historical novel about a failed Jacobite rebellion which took place in 1708. There is also a third person narrative set in 1708, which is the novel being written by the first person narrator. The novel has some very attractive features: a beautiful and romantic Scottish setting, evidence of excellent research into the rebellion, clear prose and solid development of character. However, there are some features of the novel which I found less successful, in particular, the concept of genetic memory, which is the device used to link the present-day first person narrative with the third person historical narrative. While some way to link the two narratives was obviously needed, in my view the idea that the present day author was channeling the memories of her ancestor was not convincing. This is a novel I probably would have liked much more had I been familiar with the history with which it deals, or the location in which it is set. That said, it has certainly made me interested in learning more about the history. It has also put Slains Castle and Cruden Bay firmly on the list of places I\u2019d like to visit in the future. For me, this was slightly less engaging than Every Secret Thing, which makes it a solid 3-1/2 star read."}, {"userName": "WhiskeyintheJar/Kyraryker", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2763722-whiskeyinthejar-kyraryker", "userReview": "[As soon as our present day heroine read that past heroine married another dude, I had the thought that it was still the hero (we already had the info that he was a wanted man).

On the way to the christening of her friend and agent\u2019s baby, she takes a side road and is drawn to Slains Castle. Deciding to move from France to Scotland, she rents a cottage new Slain and finds her connection to the old castle is closer even than her ancestor who once lived there.This is not a gothic, time travel or a torrid romance. It is a flawlessly crafted novel set in two time periods with a romantic relationship in each. From the first page, I was immersed in the story. Kearsley\u2019s sense of place is evocative; I was with the characters in sight, sound and even smell. Her characters became real to me. In the present day, Carrie is a wonderful protagonist; smart and independent, as is Sophie in the past. Surrounded by a strong group of supporting characters, I felt I could sit down and have a chat with any of them. The plot is so well done and flows beautifully between the two time periods. Kearsley is an excellent writer. There is a lot of factual information in the story, but it is incorporated as part of the story and through dialogue; thus never taking you out of the story or causing you to question her facts. After the end of the story, she very clear about what liberties she did take, and those were few. The explanation used for the link from the present to the past was fascinating and one with which I was unfamiliar. At the same time, there was nothing dry about this book; I did laugh, I did cry, at times, my heart beat a bit faster from suspense and romance and I absolutely loved the endings. Not normally one to do comparisons but I believe fans of Diana Gabaldon, and Mary Stewart, and others, would enjoy this book; not to mention Ms. Kearsley\u2019s existing fans. I wish her books were more frequent but, for another of Ms. Kearsley\u2019s books, I\u2019m willing to wait."}, {"userName": "Dem", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2752994-dem", "userReview": "The Winter Sea by Susanna Kearsley really seemed like a book I would love as it dealt with a part of Scottish history that I was not familiar with.

I found myself having to reread paragraphs to get people and happenings straight in my head as sometimes I found it a little difficult to follow. While I really enjoyed the historical side of this novel and enjoyed reading about the Jacobite invasion I did find the social history of the time very lacking and I would loved to have learned more about spirit, manners, and social conditions of 1708 but felt that was very much left out of this novel and I found this disappointing.The ending of the book for me was terrible.

This was my second time reading The Winter Sea. The first time was many years ago, and while I didn't recall the plot I always had images in my mind from reading the book the first time around. The sign of a good book.Kearsley's writing is rich in detail creating a vivid atmosphere for her story to unfold. The story is told via two narratives - Carrie in modern day and Sophia in the early 1700's during a lesser known Jacobite rebellion. Their stories intertwine, with a little help from a fantastical element, and while they were both compelling I admit to preferring Sophia's story line more. There are some twists thrown into the plot and the characters, generally speaking, are easy to root for making it easy to see why this book is a fan favourite.For readers looking for a bodice-ripper type read this is not it. While there are some intimate moments they are only hinted at leaving the ensuing passion to the readers' imaginations. Instead more focus was on their relationships, the beautiful setting and the Jacobites attempt to return James to England's throne to replace his half-sister, Queen Anne.For people, such as myself, who only have a basic knowledge of Scottish history do not fear. Kearsley explains some of the Jacobite history without a huge info dump while still keeping in line with her story. Readers will enjoy reading the appendix at the end of the book where Kearsley explains which characters and events within her book are based on historical fact. The only criticisms I have for the book is that the ending is wrapped up a little too neatly. Sure, it's a nice way to end the story but a little too easy. I know that some readers weren't fond of one of Sophia's decisions in the book (I wasn't happy reading it either) but, in the end, that was probably a more realistic decision based on how things were in the 18th century.Overall, I'm happy I could delve back into this book. This time around I got to read my personalized, signed copy and that made it even more special. For fans of well-researched Historical Fiction with a solid nod to genealogy, who like a good love story (or two) set in the beauty that is Scotland then this is a book for you."}, {"userName": "Deborah Pickstone", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37849334-deborah-pickstone", "userReview": "I don't usually go for time travel themes, especially romances - this author is a RITA award winner - and I find it odd that time travel writers seem to always end up in Scotland.....but all in all, this was very readable and the time travel thing was handled in a way that demanded willing suspension of disbelief - but not so far that it became impossible. The time travel was presented as a kind of genetic memory that a return to places known in her past brought forth for the heroine. Of course she ends up with the perfect man and all ends happily; it is a romance. But the history was well researched and an uncommon subject, too, adding to the interest value. The heroine is also presented as a successful author with address to her creative process which was interesting.My two complaints were the excessive 'Scotifying' of the locals' speech and the author's insistence on lecturing the reader on correct pronunciation within the story which I found very irritating.

First off, this is not a romance novel. This is historical fiction with a love story in it. It would be a G rating. It makes Disney's Pinocchio look risque. There's tons and tons of history. Not being a history buff - my knowledge of history goes something like \"Columbus sailed the ocean blue in 1492\" - it was a bit daunting. I followed along as best I could and tried to get some help from my husband. Alas, I was able to keep up and may have learned a thing or two. Well, there is a love story...and the ending is...I'm not sure. I really can't say what I think about the ending. I've never read a story like this before and can barely explain it. Basically, we have the narrator, who is a writer and goes to different locations to research and get into the setting of her characters and the story she's writing. We travel and see her interactions with others. The story she's writing is a love story, complete with a war being fought, grief, friendship, politics and more. Without giving anything away, it still has a HEA, but maybe not a complete HEA, or at least not the HEA I would have written, if I wrote this story. I cried and my heart aches. Just as an aside, there's a point in the novel where the characters talk about the effects of winter, but the hope that lies beneath and promises spring. I love spring! Winter is a most dreaded season for me, but what a good outlook that it's a time for the birds to stop their song for awhile and things pause and wait...but spring always arrives and brings us the sun, flowers, singing birds...I recommend this book and will look for this author's other books!!!"}, {"userName": "Kathy ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/971945-kathy", "userReview": "There's a good reason why this book was on my \"why haven't I read this book yet\" shelf. I should have read it long ago. The historical fiction aspect of the novel dealing with the Stewart claim to the English throne and the exile in France, with the Jacobites' attempts to restore the Stewarts to the throne, is an especially favorite part of history for me. The story within a story vehicle for presenting the intertwining centuries' tale is also a form to which I'm partial. Author Carrie McClelland is drawn to the Slains Castle in Scotland as she writes her lastest novel about the 1708 Jacobite attempt to land James Stewart in Scotland to reclaim the English throne. Carrie discovers her ancestral connection to this story, as the characters speak to her and guide her as to the true account. History, romance, and mystery in two centuries determine the life course of two women, related by blood and determination.
