Do I even need to say anything else? I mean, that's like my list of all of my favorite things in a book. So if you don't want to go read it based on that sentence, then ... well... your loss.Actually, I do have two more things to say. (1) I wasn't sure at first if I would like reading an entire book through the POV of a blind person, but actually it was wonderful. It gave the story a depth and a perspective that is sometimes lacking in YA.(2) This is the first YA in a long time (if ever) that I've actually highlighted some sentences because they were so well written. Here they are: When the protagonist is afraid: \"My heart is a desperate animal, smashing against my rib cage.\" Is that an awesome metaphor, or what?When the protagonist is embarrassed: \"I wonder if I've just thrust my face into a wall of fire, or if it only feels that way.\" LOL! Love it!OK, now go get this book and read it. The author says on her website that a sequel is underway (but, if there never was a sequel, this is wrapped up enough at the end that you wouldn't live with a grudge against the author for the rest of your life). So, A.G. Henley, if you're reading this, please stop and get back to work on it.

It has a great deal of action and suspense throughout. And I am seriously enjoying books that involved people, MCs with a disability! Fennel, or Fenn to her friends is blind, or Sightless as she is called. She lives in the forest with her people, the Groundlings. As the names suggests, her people live on the ground, and there are other people who live up in the trees, the Loftys. The Groundlings and Loftys have a uneasy history between them, they tolerate each other most days, but there is still tensions between them. But the time when they come together is when fearsome creatures, Fleash-eaters, attack them and forces them to hide. The Groundlings take to the caves and the Loftys to the trees. And in the forest there is only one water hole where they can collect their water. But it is told a Sightless is protected from fleshies (flesh-eaters), thus it is there job to collect water and bring it back to the Groundlings and the Loftys. But the Sightless has a Lofty protector, a Keeper, that protects them during their journey. And this is where Fenn meets Peree, her Keeper. And he watches over her every time. But the fleshies become reckless and are not willing to leave. Which makes Fenn decide to venture beyond the caves and seek for the legendary waters that is said to be cleaner than their own and protected by the fleshies. With no other choice she goes with her Keeper to find and help save their people. But during this journey, they will face many dangers, and not from fleshies or animals but by infections and dehydrations. Yet as they continue on, they will both discover secrets that will change how they see their perspective and who they can trust. This was a wonderful start to a series, I can see how this series can keep going stronger as the story progresses. Will Fenn and Peree be the ones to prove that Groundlings and Loftys can live together, can be friendly and have harmony amongst each other? You'll have to read to find out!

Scratch that--I NEVER read them. For one thing, I'm one of those grammar Nazis who can't handle a few errors (per page). For another, I'm tired of unoriginal YA stories that are all trying to be replicas of Twilight or the Hunger Games. So imagine my surprise when I started reading this book on a whim, more because of its stellar reviews than because of its plot, cover, or price tag.For the record, this book was nothing like Twilight or the Hunger Games--and I mean that in the best way possible.I don't want to give anything away, so for a synopsis read the blurb or other reviews (that's what I did). I'm writing this in case someone else like me happens along. And because, as a (hopefully) budding author myself, I felt a bit obligated to encourage readers to pick up this hidden bit of literary beauty.The plot is original and creative--I loved the idea behind the Scourge and being sightless, although parts were slightly unbelievable even in the context of the story. That's probably why I took away a star (although if it were a perfect world, I'd only have taken away half a star). Fennel is an extraordinary character--she is strong, witty, funny, imperfect in all the right ways (meaning she isn't an obnoxiously and unrealistically perfect person), and she grows. One of my biggest pet peeves is when a character remains static throughout the story, like some famous ones I could name. She is afraid and doubts herself at times, but what teenager wouldn't? The supporting cast was nearly as fantastic, but Fenn is the real treasure here.Error-wise: I found one or two errors and a few things I'd fix, but all in all this book is very clean. It feels a bit unfinished--doesn't have that nice, squeaky polish that big publishing companies add--but it passes muster and should be priced much higher if you ask me. The story brought me out of my own editing mode (which is hard to turn off once it's on), and had me longing for more. The story is fantastic as a stand-alone (and I DON'T think there should be a sequel), but I will be keeping my eye out for more of Henley's work regardless.Cute story, a bit cheesy at times (I've always had a soft spot for cheese), a tiny bit predictable, but overall a fantastic read and well worth the metaphorical leap into independent territory."}, {"userName": "Carol (StarAngel's Reviews) Allen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6294320-carol-starangel-s-reviews-allen", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book and the different outlook on the zombies.Definitely a unique storyline and the characters were compelling.

Their deformed faces are masks of horror. They roam the forests, reeking of festering flesh, consuming anything living. \nThey're the reason why the Groundlings and the Lofties, have to be constantly on guard, in order to survive.\n To hear the agony of their hunger, smell their disease, feel their hot breath on my skin ... the idea feels me with dread and loathing.\nGroundlings and Lofties used to be one community. They all lived in the trees where they would be safe from any Scourge raiding. But although they were safe they still have to gather food and protect their resources. So the dark haired were forced to live by the ground, while the fair-haired remained above. By then once a year, the Exchange happened, if a baby was born in the ground fair-haired he must go to live with a Loftie family and vice-versa.So you can imagine, that besides the truce this two have, the tension was palpable.Now the Scourge are closing in, and so Fenn must bring water for her community that hides in the caves and to the Lofties. For that she will have the help of a keeper, Peree, a Loftie that will be there for her protection. Although Fenn should mistrust him, she finds herself liking his companion. He is kind, protective and thoughtful. He is there for her, every step of the way, he is there to comfort her, to entertain her with his stories.In the midst of an eminent war, Fenn and Peree go in a crusade to find another source of water. Does it exist that pure water or is just a myth?Now Fenn and Peree must rely in each other, fighting for their survival and ultimately uncovered many truths about them all.*****This book was just amazing!A rich and complex new world, that makes us question, how humanity got to that point?

It has been a long time ago since I really liked a YA Dystopian book. So many authors nowadays try to be the new Suzanne Collins, or Stephanie Meyer. The only thing that differs is the circumstances and the dystopian world they create but they all copy the 3 persons relationship. One girl who loves 2 boys. Two boys love that girl. So I have read a lot of disappointing YA books because of that.This time I was not disappointed though. Yes it is maybe in some eyes not the same genre because of zombies but I disagree, it is set after our world (nearly) died so I consider it the same genre.This has a lot of surprises though and to be honest, although I liked it, I think this should have stayed just the one book and not be a part of a series, but apparently this is book 1.Yes I do not mean I do not want to read more by this author but I worry that book 2 will be what I described in the first part of my review, cause there is indeed a second boy in this book who loves the main character, only difference so far is she does not love him back.But I can see it coming, in book 2 boy 1 surprisingly disappears, she thinks he died but he did not, and she hooks up with boy 2. Then boy 1 will come back blablabla.Okay. So please author of this very enjoyable first book, with great twists and very exiting new world, do not do that. I really enjoyed reading this book. It was refreshing so I hope that you do not go there.I enjoyed this book very much so not sure what to give. 4 or 5 stars?4.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Emily (Falling for YA)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4788621-emily-falling-for-ya", "userReview": "I once got scared because my room was \u201ctoo warm\u201d, I thought maybe a ghost was using reverse psychology and making the room cold was too obvious. I think this explains why I tend to stay away from Zombie novels. I get freaked out easily and do not like to be scared. I am so glad I got over my fears and read The Scourge though, because it is now one of my favorite reads of 2012!The novel follows Fennel, a Groundling, who because she is blind is tasked with gathering water for both The Lofties, who live in the trees and her people during attacks of the Scourge. Because Fennel is sightless she is immune to the Scourge. To protect her during water gathering Fennel has a Lofty protector, Peree, who she begins to trust despite all of the terrible things that have been said about his people.The plot twists in The Scourge kept me on my toes at all times. Just when I was starting to get used to the world Henley pulled the rug out from under me. I was forced to reevaluate everything I thought to be true about the society. This happened to me more then once and showcased Henley\u2019s talent as a storyteller.The characters in The Scourge immediate sucked me in to the story and instantly had me rooting for them. I have never read a book written from the perspective of someone who is blind. It was refreshing to read about how Fennel perceived the world without ever being able to see it. Despite Fennel\u2019s lack of sight I felt like she saw more then those around her. Peree was incredibly likable. I loved listening to the stories he told and his strength. His dedication to Fennel felt completely natural and melted my heart.The romance was one of my favorite things about this story. It was sweet, slow, and didn\u2019t overshadow the plot twists. The romance complemented the story and was believable. The Lofties and Groundlings have spent generations resenting each other, Fennel and Peree are not going to instantly put that behind them. Fennel\u2019s mixed feelings were natural.Overall, I loved this novel. If you are nervous about picking up The Scourge because it is self-published do not hesitate! I mean it run to your e-reader and download this novel. It was amazingly well written and completely addictive. I could not stop reading until I was finished and even now I am eagerly awaiting the release of the sequel!"}, {"userName": "Tee loves Kyle Jacobson", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2566871-tee-loves-kyle-jacobson", "userReview": "I just want to give a huge Thank You to Kismet Touring for allowing me to be a part of this awesome tour.

The Scourge is a story about a girl who is blind yes you heard me she is blind and she is a groundling who has to rely on her senses to help her people out. Being blind is not that bad but being the groundling that has to face the scourge alone does not scare her. Fenn knows her people need fresh water and she knows that she will have to face the scourge to get that water. But Fenn has a protector Peree who is a Lofty Keeper and he has vowed to keep her safe.Peree is determined to keep Fenn safe and sound from the scourge and make sure nothing happens to her. What he did not bank on was falling in love with her. But the two of them start to get closer and as time goes on they develop feelings for each other and can not deny them. Fenn knows she is in danger every time she has to get water for her people and the lofty keepers but she also knows that a job is a job and a lot of people are relying on her.Then Fenn and Peree uncover a huge secret and Fenn is not sure who she can trust. She questions everything she has been taught and with this secret looming she and Peree will have to figure out who to trust and who to stay away from. What will happen to Fenn?

From the first chapter of the book I've been completely caught up by the plot and I was so curious to discover about the Scourge, that I kept reading until the first hours of the morning, sometimes. Overall, I think that the world the author created is simply brilliant and absolutely interesting but then, the strong point of the book is certainly how the society is ruled. Honestly, it's quite a common post-apocalyptic society, but then the twists and the secrets that will be revealed at the end, contribute to make the whole situation special. The society in which Fennel, the protagonist, lives is organized in Groundlings, those who live on the ground, in direct contact with the dangerous Scourge, and provide water for all the people, and Lofties, those who live on the trees, far away from the horror and fear of staying on the ground, where the beasts can find you; the only duty of the Lofties is to protect from the trees the Water Bearer, a blind person (like Fennel) who is protected from the Scourge, who has the task to provide water for others.The division into these two categories happens when the baby is just born: if he/she has dark colors, he/she will be a groundling, if he/she has light colors, a Lofties; this implies that the majority of families are mixted and there are a few possibilites that a mother can keep her own child. I found this whole situation really fascinating becuase it shows us how desperate and cruel human beings can be, in order to assure themselves security and survival. It's useless to say that in this case, Groundlings and Lofties were not in good relationship, since the Lofties benefited of the resources the Groundlings had to die to achieve.The point that turns the book completely is when Fennel decides to find the famous Hidden Waters (a source that is hidden in the caves, far away from the Scourge, who didn't seem to like darkness) , accompained by Peere, her Lofty Keeper: this journey will led the two of them toward incredible adventures and difficulties but, above all, they will discover a shocking truth that will once for all expose the cruelty and injustice of the society they live in. I really loved how full of adventures this book was but the end was just shocking! There were so many revelations I didn't absolutely see coming and you know how much I love surprises!! Moreover I think the author's choice of speaking from Fennel's point of view was an amazing choice, because her blindness contribute to make the book more vivid and real; not being able to see things, she always describes the world around her with all 4 senses, so that you can perfectly see what she can't see instead."}, {"userName": "Lindsay", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4337141-lindsay", "userReview": "Zombies are my bread and butter. They are what make the world go \u2019round. I have read so many zombie books and graphic novels, not to mention watching movies and shows. I had started to believe that I had seen it all. Then, along comes A.G. Henley, and I can freely admit that I didn\u2019t see her twist coming. YAY! It takes a lot to surprise me, and it\u2019s always so nice to find this quality in a book. Obviously, it would be a huge spoiler if I told you what the twist was, so I won\u2019t even hint at it. All I will say is that these are not your typical, run-of-the-mill, walking corpses!Fennel, Fen, is such an interesting character to me. She\u2019s blind, which can obviously cause some problems. Most obviously, she\u2019s wandering around in a zombie infested forest! She is forced to use her ears and sense of smell to maneuver around the living dead (good things those things moan and stink, right?), memorizing her path to prevent getting lost and separated from her loved ones. It can also create an interesting scenario for the author, who is now forced to describe scents, sounds and how everything feels to the touch, as opposed to what they actually look like. I thought Henley did a phenomenal job of it, and I often found myself imagining what she must see in her mind\u2019s eye.Fen is her village\u2019s water bearer. It is her job to bring water for her own people, the Groundlings, and for the group of people who live in the trees, the Lofties. It is Peree\u2019s job, as her Keeper, to protect her from the Scourge while she makes the trip to the water each day. While this seems like a symbiotic relationship, of sorts, it is quite political. Normally, politics grate on me, but in this case, it adds a complex level of tension to the story line. So many characters seem to be working for their own personal agendas, and it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess who is being honest.As Fen and Peree are forced to work together, they inevitably grow closer. While I didn\u2019t feel a lot of passion between them, I definitely bought into their companionship. They have a great dialogue, and I can sense their need to lean on, as well as protect, each other. I have a very bad feeling, though, that there is a love triangle looming in the sequel. *potential ugh*So it took me a really long time to finish The Scourge. Do you ever read a book as slowly as possible, dreading every page turn? This book did that for me, because every new page brought me closer to the end, and every fiber of my being didn\u2019t want to reach that last page. I kept one eye on the progression bar, wondering how everything could possibly turn out alright. There was going to be cliffhanger, for sure, and I hate cliffhangers! (and by hate, I mean secretly love\u2026) After all was said and done, I was actually pretty happy with how it wrapped up. Now, how long will it be before I break down and get the sequel??I received a copy of this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Kristina", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4721554-kristina", "userReview": "I found \"The Scourge\" through an Amazon recommendation and after seeing all of the great reviews for it, I decided to pick it up. I'm very glad that I did! Is there anything that the great Amazon computer doesn't know? This is one of those post-apocalyptic YA novels, kind of in the vein of \"The Hunger Games.\" The story centers around a teenager named Fennel. She belongs to a community called the Groundlings. They live on the forest floor and spend their lives in fear of \"the scourge,\" a pack of roaming zombie-like creatures. Above the Groundlings live the Lofties, in the tree tops. They are safer from the scourge due to their height. They won't let the Groundlings up into the safety of their trees, which creates a ton of bad blood, as you can imagine. Whenever the scourge appears, the Groundlings have to retreat to caves, which the creatures won't enter, and wait until they move on again. Fennel is sightless (i.e. blind). Since the sightless are for some reason immune to the scourge, she is tasked with taking daily trips to the nearby lake to bring back water to her community while they hide in the caves. A Lofty named Peree is assigned to be her keeper. He stays up in the trees, acts as her eyes and shoots any of the scourge who get too close with his arrows in exchange for half of Fennel's water, which he is able to take to his community. When the latest scourge visitation starts dragging out too long, Fennel volunteers to venture deep into the caves and try to find a fabled, protected water source for her people. What she finds changes everything she knows about her community.This is the first book I have read in which the protagonist is blind. It was very interesting to read a novel from that perspective. A.G. Henley does a really good job conveying how a person who can't see interprets the world. You don't feel like you're missing anything while reading, and it actually adds to the suspense in several situations.The characters are well written and the plot has enough twists and turns to keep you guessing. This is one of those books you don't want to put down because you're anxious to see what happens next. I think that both kids and adults will find something to enjoy in this novel.

At first the writing seemed similar to my first creative writing class submissions, and I found myself mentally correcting things my own professors mentioned and counted off in my writings that I saw within the first few chapters, but after the plot gets going, I suddenly forgot all about the minor details and was sucked in.Fennel is similar to other dystopian heroines, and the story line is similar to other dystopian tales I've read, but the characters are so well developed, and genuine that I fell in love within 3 chapters.The story telling within the book is one thing that enchanted me, and I cannot wait for the second book in this series!"}, {"userName": "Jenny", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7753595-jenny", "userReview": "This story had me hooked from the very beginning.

I\u2019ve read enough of this genre now that it takes a great spin on this premise, or something really unique about the world, to make me sit up and take notice. And take notice is exactly what happened when I read this book.As I mentioned earlier, I haven\u2019t read a lot of zombie apocalypse books. Sure, I\u2019ve read a few, but in general, it\u2019s not a genre I seek out. Had I judged The Scourge by that association, I would have missed out on an incredibly unique twist \u2013 the main character is blind! I was so curious to see how the author would handle this. Would I be able to sympathize with her struggles? Would I see the word the way she \u201csees\u201d it?The heroine is Fennel, or Fenn for short. She\u2019s gifted with being blind (referred to as Sightless in the book). Only the Sightless can survive walking among the Scourge, who are zombies created by a world gone wrong. In Fenn\u2019s community, there\u2019s a division between the Groundlings and the Lofties. Groundlings live on the ground (appropriately named!), and Lofties live up in the trees. I bet they have some awesome treehouses! The two communities don\u2019t really get along, but they are forced to cooperate to survive the visits from the Scourge.When the Scourge terrorize the small community, the Groundlings are forced to retreat into nearby caves. As one of only two gifted Sightless, it\u2019s Fenn\u2019s job to make her way to the watering hole and gather water for both communities during these sieges. We meet Fenn as she\u2019s about to take her first terrifying trip, and I could feel her horror (but don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not too scary \u2013 I had no problems sleeping at night, except for being unable to set the book aside!). Peree is the assigned Loftie who protects her using his bow and arrows when the Scourge get too close while she gathers water. It\u2019s a perilous trip, but one that Fenn has trained for her entire life.There\u2019s SO much more that happens, but you know us \u2013 we keep it spoiler free here at Kindles & Wine. To say any more than this would reveal too much, yet, oh how I wish I could talk more about it!As I mentioned, I was a smidge concerned I\u2019d have trouble relating to young Fenn. Silly, silly Heather. That was so shortsighted of me. (You see what I did there? :)) The author did a fantastic job of showing the world from Fenn\u2019s perspective. I loved how others describe colors for Fenn in terms of activities or feelings; it really helped with picturing the world she lives in. I appreciated how Fenn\u2019s strength and courage is so deep. Nobody pities her for being blind \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say they envy her, but they certainly admire and respect and even look up to her. In this world, being Sightless isn\u2019t a limitation but, instead, is liberating. Though terrifying, she can walk among the Scourge and survive (I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t need to tell you what zombies do to most people, right?), and dark caves are no problem for someone who\u2019s blind.When Fenn and Peree are forced to work together for the good of both their communities, things get really interesting (like so interesting, again, I can\u2019t talk about it!). It was neat to read about the Groundlings from the Lofties\u2019 perspective, and vice versa. It helped me to understand why things were the way they are and allowed me to create a better picture of this world and how things work. Even some of the vocabulary is different, which showed how separate the two communities are despite the Lofties pretty much living directly above the Groundlings!I loved the action and pace of this book! There\u2019s not really any downtime \u2013 it was fast and furious right until the end. There was more than one reveal/twist (and possibly more than I mention here) \u2013 one I saw coming, one I suspected, and one was like\u2026what?!\u2026followed by my mouth hanging open for several pages. I love being so engrossed in a plot that I\u2019m right there in the moment and am shocked.I honestly don\u2019t remember how this book found its way onto my radar. Was it a friend, a K&W reader, or just random? I have no clue, otherwise I\u2019d thank them. Speak up if you want credit! I was wrong to be concerned about this book being associated with zombies (I\u2019m so mad my rebellion lasted as long as it did!), and I wouldn\u2019t even classify it as a zombie book \u2013 they have their role, but the book isn\u2019t about them. The book is about the two societies and an amazing Sightless woman finding out how deep her strength and courage truly run. Don\u2019t let zombies deter you!\nBottom Line\nIt took me 7 months to move this book from having purchased it to the top of my TBR list, but immediately after finishing The Scourge, I got the second book and have already read it. That should speak for itself. :)Rating: A"}, {"userName": "Yoon-Ji", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13264515-yoon-ji", "userReview": "http://theinkgobbler.blogspot.com/When people find out that a book is self-published, they tend to naturally shy away from it. I guess they think, if a publishing house rejects a manuscript, it's probably not good enough. The truth is that sometimes, the story isn't what they're looking for at the time, or they've already signed a similar story. Whatever the case is, just because a book is self-published, it doesn't mean that it's bad! When I picked up \"The Scourge\", I didn't even know that it wasn't published by Random House or Penguin or what have you, and it didn't come through at all when I actually read the book either--in fact, it's one you should check out.Seventeen-year-old Groundling, Fennel, is Sightless, but she knows how to survive in the dangerous forest. When she's called by her people to begin her lifelong task of braving the Scourge--flesh-eating creatures that haunt humans--to collect water for both the Groundlings and the Lofties, Fennel is anything but fearless. But she won't be alone. Fenn's Lofty Keeper, Peree, a boy who smells like summer, protects her from the trees. When the unlikely pair uncovers a secret that shatters the truths they thought they knew, Fenn must decide who and what to protect--her people, her growing love for a boy she thought she'd never fall for, or the elusive dream of lasting peace in the forest.I don't know whether this sounds strange or whatever, but the fact that the protagonist is blind just made the story all the more interesting. It presented all sorts of challenges, but Fennel deals with them in a way that makes her likable and extremely believable. Rather than presenting her readers with a two-dimensional, archetypal 'strong' heroine with a single weakness she has to overcome, Ms. Henley weaves in layers to Fenn's character that make her anything but boring. There were times, however, when her blindness wasn't entirely believable in some of the descriptions--they were almost too visual, and it would've been interesting to craft images in your head while reading relying solely on smells, sounds and textures. Nonetheless, Fenn is a unique heroine that I enjoyed being with throughout the book, and I definitely see potential for development in sequels!Another aspect that was helped by Fenn's blindness is the romance between her and Peree. In a lot of YA books, you'll see the protagonist madly falling head over heels for a super hot boy with piercing eyes, and sometimes it makes me wonder whether it's more of a physical attraction than a deep, real love. And that's something that really bothers me, since romance is a huge element to the YA genre. If the relationship between the so-called star-crossed lovers comes across as shallow, it just ruins it. But in \"The Scourge\", because Fenn can't just fall for Peree because of his looks, but instead ends up being attracted to him because of his actions and his personality, their romance adds another layer of sweetness and believability to the story. I liked the way their relationship developed, though maybe it could've been stretched out a tad longer.That being said, I think one thing that put me off just a little was the plot development. The ways the twists in the storyline were introduced to the readers were clumsy and way too sudden, and it just didn't seem too realistic to me. If Ms. Henley had dropped a few hints that led up to these surprises, the plot would've run a lot smoother. Towards the middle of the book, it was pretty much twist after turn after twist, and it was just too much and too out-of-the-blue to work really well.Nevertheless, \"The Scourge\" is definitely worth reading, especially if you love realistic romances, or a believable, unique character. Peree and Fenn really tugged on my heartstrings, and I look forward to the sequel to see how things unfold.Rating: 4/5"}, {"userName": "Kerri", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1568820-kerri", "userReview": "Welcome to your typical YA dystopia. Post-apocalyptic world, small, scattered groups of humans fighting for survival, menaced by the foul undead. Boy and girl from conflicting groups fall in love, go on a quest and return home determined to unite and save their communities against terrific odds. Sounds familiar right? Did I mention that Fennel, our heroine and narrator, is blind? Yes, Fennel is sightless, that's one of the first things the book description tells us. As a blind person myself, descriptions like this always get me interested, and worried. What manner of blind character are we dealing with here? The tough, insanely independent Superblink, taking on the world with incredible powers and a trusty animal companion in tow? Or the meek, essentially helpless blind damsel who spends most of the story being carried around by her hunky protector, acting as delicate inspiration for the rest of the party? Or, almost as bad as that, the saintly, wonderful blind girl who goes through all manner of trial in order to be rewarded with the miraculous gift of sight? Unfortunately, these very broad types are what I've come to expect from stories like this. You can only imagine how pleasantly surprised I was to discover that Fennel was, in fact, human. Yes she was stubbornly independent, but also resourceful, adaptable, and able to ask for and accept help when she needed it. She's a full member of her community, expected to pull her own weight and live a completely normal life, complete with mischief and potential boyfriends. The one \"superpower\" she supposedly possesses, the protection from The Scourge her blindness gives her, turns out not to be quite as special as previously believed. She's angry, vulnerable, aroused, loving, weighed down by responsibility, terrified and occasionally self-pitying. In short, Fennel is perfect in her imperfections, reacting to the situations she finds herself in exactly as anyone else would. It's rare to come across such a fully realized blind character, and I can't praise the author highly enough for an incredible job. I've been in contact with her via Twitter and I look forward to learning more about her research process, as well as answering any questions she might have about life as a blind person. Oh, and the book? Tons of fun. Peri, our hero, is a delight, and the world-building is quite good, though I'd be interested to learn more about the fall of civilization and what led the Groundlings and Lofties to their current positions. Overall this, and the novella and sequel that follow, is well worth the read. A well-realized dystopic future with one of the most unique and exciting protagonists I've come across."}, {"userName": "Jamie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15307591-jamie", "userReview": "I'd been eyeing this book for a while and was out of good books to read so I thought I'd give it a try so I sent the sample to my Kindle and instantly fell in love with the story. I was so drawn into it that I'd forgotten it was a sample and when it ended I immediately bought the book and clicked as fast as I could to get back to where I was at. This is just one of those stories that sucks you in and you never want to leave. Halfway through the book I noticed I wasn't even seeing any of the words, I was there with Fenn and Peree, adventuring right beside them, seeing everything they see, or didn't see in Fenn's case and sharing their journey.I love Dystopian books and I absolutely love the type of setting in this book. Even though there's horrible things going on, there's just something about a society that lives off the land that greatly appeals to me. I'm too much of a wuss to do it myself but I do love to daydream about it so this book gave me a lot to daydream about. The Scourge is a very character driven story. Sure there's action but the real meat of the story is in the characters and A.G. Henley does a great job of bringing them to life. What really impressed me was the way she described the world through the eyes of Fenn who is blind. I was wondering how a book could be descriptive with the main character being unable to see yet she handled it beautifully. You get a full detail of every little thing Fenn encounters, not only through her sharp senses but also through the eyes of those around her. I was simply amazed at how detailed this world is. I also enjoyed the fact that it's not just your average run of the mill zombie horde. There's some nice twists in this book that fit so well with the overall theme of the story.It looks as if this was A.G. Henley's first book which impresses me even more. Not only is it a wonderful story that's beautifully written but it's also extremely well edited. I didn't find a single error or anything to distract me from my wonderful reading experience. It seems all too often some independent authors take editing for granted so it's very nice to see those that put their heart and souls into their work. It shows here and for that she deserves to be congratulated. I will definitely be buying the next book and recommend this book to anyone who loves strong characters, a great storyline with rich detail and a bit of romance. If you're looking for something a bit different then give The Scourge a try, you'll be glad that you did."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7420218-katie", "userReview": "Top Pick: Review of The Scourge by A.G. Henley\tWhen I saw the cover art for The Scourge at the bottom of my own novel's \u201cCustomers who purchased this book also purchased...\u201d page, I knew I wanted to read it. The haunting description of Fennel, a sightless girl who must be the water bearer for her people during the time of the scourge drew me in. The scourge are basically zombies, humans turned flesh-eaters who attack the healthy, turning them sick as well. For some reason the scourge do not attack the sightless, so Fennel is tapped to take an agonizing walk down to the water through the throng of fleshies everyday. \tThen enter Peree, a tree-dwelling hunter, who has been given the task of being her keeper. Peree is her eyes and ears while she slips through the masses of sick ones. Fennel's people and Peree's people live in an uneasy alliance. Yet, somehow these two find an instant connection, one that concerns both of them. Groundies and Lofties do not mix. Fennel agonizes over the bond that grows between her and Peree. \tWhen the scourge doesn't leave after a few days like normal, Fennel's people get desperate. Fennel volunteers to search for the Hidden Waters supposedly buried deep within the caves in which they are staying. Peree slips away to guide her. The two embark on a nail-biting journey through pitch-black caves where they are tested to the core of their being. \tI was instantly jealous of the premise of this novel. What can be more terrifying than walking into a mob of flesh-eating monsters with no sight? Henley is a master of upping the terror, bringing us in to Fennel's haunting journey to the water hole. And here's the amazing thing, Henley cannot employ any visual imagery. No visual imagery! It's amazing. I thought for sure the book would flounder and die in a sightless world, but no. As a reader, I got used to wandering around a world without sight. Somehow Henley uses surrounding sounds, smells and touch to make a world as vivid as any with sight. I was in awe of how easily she accomplished something that even master writers would not attempt. \tI went online to look for a publisher for the novel. I was sure because of the quality that it had been picked up by one of the big six. However, as far as I can tell it is self-published. There are gems out there in the self-published arena and this is one of them. I highly recommend this book to fans of speculative Young Adult fiction.

In her world her blindness is a blessing for the people who fear the scourge. The scourge are zombie like, and would tear any person apart turning them into one of their own. Only one type of person is exempt \u2013 the blind. The scourge can\u2019t touch the blind so they become a person highly dependent on in the village when the scourge arrives. Fennel is the water bearer at times when the village is in hiding. As a groundling Fennel needs someone to watch over from above, people who live in the trees are known as Lofties and Fennel\u2019s loftie is Peree. :) loved him.The world building was well done and the inventive way of separating the clans due to colour gave a more daunting tone to this fantasy tale. Fennel was one of the most kind and bravest people to read. Peree who watches her from the trees was interesting and an unexpected friendship blossoms between these two. The relationship is patient, kind and gentle. Bear is another love interest for Fennel but I much preferred Peree.The basis of the Scourge and what Fennel and Peree thought about their world comes crashing down when they go in search of secret waters within the caves. Some revelations had me gasping but one about Fennel filled me with rage and I must admit I shed some tears. This is the first book I have read where the heroine is blind and what a story it is. This was a well-crafted , imaginative and gripping tale of bravery love and a lesson lay within the story that us as humans give such power to lies that soon they become very real."}, {"userName": "Maxine", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5208303-maxine", "userReview": "In this very enjoyable novel, civilization has been destroyed by some horrible event. Now two groups survive. the Groundlings who, of course, live on the ground and the Lofties who live in the trees above them. The two groups have little trust for each other but are forced to work together to deal with the Scourge, zombie-like creatures who roam the land, turning anyone who is unfortunate enough to be caught by them, anyone, that is, but the Sightless who, for some reason, can walk among the Scourge without being attacked. Fennel is one of the sightless and it is her job to collect the water for both the Groundlings and the Lofties in the event of an attack of the Scourge. It is the role of one Loftie, in this case, Paree, to protect Fennel while she collects the water.There are rumours that there is water somewhere which protects from the Scourge but, although many have sought it, they have either returned without finding it or they have never returned at all. When the Scourge comes and doesn't leave, Fennel volunteers to seek these waters and Paree, secretly, goes with her. What they find at the end of their journey will overturn everything they thought they knew about the Scourge and their communities.Aimed at a YA audience The Scourge explores the question of prejudice and how it can make us blind to the world around us. It is also a rather sweet romance. And, oh yeah, it's a pretty darn good dystopian novel with some very interesting characters and a plot which makes it very hard to put down. My recommendation: if you're a fan of YA, of dystopian novels, you like a little romance thrown into the mix, and enjoy a well-written post-apocalyptic tale with a good message (but not one that smacks you on the head), and very little graphic violence, try The Scourge.

The story is about a girl who has so much tenacity to help her community despite the fact that she can\u2019t see.Fennel might not be as badass as Katniss from The Hunger Games, or Tris from the Divergent series, but she has this quiet strength within her that you will see as the story progresses.

At first I was hesitant, because the protagonist (Fennel) is Sightless (blind) and I am hugely into descriptions, as it paints a mental picture for me. Henley was phenomenal at describing the scenery with sounds and smells, light and dark, that it painted that clear picture for me. Rather refreshing point of view actually. The story is one of those post zombie apocalypse types, but with a Romeo and Juliet twist. In this setting, there are two villages, one on the ground (Groundlings) and one in the trees (Lofties)who have tentativly fragile symbiotic relationship (basically, they deal with each other because they have too, but open warfar is not far behind). It is told from the POV of a blind teenager, who is protected from the Scourge by her Sightlessness. When the Scourge come, the Groundlings take to the caves for protection, and the Lofties are safe in the trees. Since she is protected, she is sent to be the Water Bearer, to travel through the mess of zombies and gather water rations. She has a Lofty Keeper (Peregrine), who protects her from the trees and guides her with his eyes. She has to work through her growing feelings for her Keeper, and her loyalty to her people that depend wholeheartedly on her. I started and finished this book in the same say. It was awesome. I full recommend it, because it teaches you strength in a whole new light, from the source of a blind person. In fact, most of the book, I forgot she was blind because she was so strong, self-sufficient, and capable.

I just want to state how much I LOVED this book. Granted it wasn't perfect, but overall, it was a great, fast paced read for me. I loved Fenn and Peree. LOVED. Their characters were likable, believable and very well written. The story is told in first person, which I find to be a much more enjoyable way to read.
