It is remarkable as the first published book in which Verne was cautionary and to some degree pessimistic about the development of science and technology.\u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e

Franco-Prussian War, which began in July 1870 and ended some 10 months later, had some fairly significant and long-lasting aftereffects. As a result of its surrender, France had to cede over to Germany the bulk of the Alsace-Lorraine territory, while Germany emerged a unified empire, effectively altering the balance of European power. For Frenchman Jules Verne, the Germans would never be regarded in the same way again, and his sentiments toward the former enemy would be abundantly displayed in his novel \"The Begum's Fortune.\" This was to be the 18th novel for the so-called \"Father of Science Fiction,\" out of an eventual 54 to be published during his lifetime; eight more would be released posthumously. As were all of the previous 17 titles, \"The Begum's Fortune\" was released by arrangement with the Parisian publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel, who had bought Verne's first novel, \"Five Weeks in a Balloon,\" in 1863. Until his death in 1905, Verne would write a novel (or two) every year, in a series of books known as \"Les Voyages Extraordinaires.\" \"The Begum's Fortune\" was initially released in 1879, when Verne was 51; his 19th novel, \"Tribulations of a Chinaman in China,\" an adventure tale, would also be published that same year! \"The Begum's Fortune,\" though not as sci-fi oriented as some of his earliest works, yet features some interesting predictions that put it marginally in the science fiction realm. It is a short, fast-moving novel, and one ripe for reappraisal today. Sadly, it has been infrequently reprinted, and I was fortunate indeed to have acquired my 1968 Ace edition--aka the \"Fitzroy edition\"--with a cover price of 60 cents.In the book, the reader encounters a Frenchman named Dr. Sarrasin, who, as Verne's story begins, is attending a scientific convention in Brighton. While there, he is given some extraordinary news by a London solicitor: He, Sarrasin, has just inherited some 21 million pounds following the death of his great-uncle, who had been living in India with his magnificently wealthy begum wife of the book's title. Sarrasin immediately decides to use his windfall in the furtherance of a pet scientific project: the building of a model city that will demonstrate to mankind the epitome of safe and hygienic living. Troubles quickly arise, however, when the German professor Schultz, a chemistry teacher in Jena, makes a rival claim on the vast fortune. After a short legal battle, convincingly detailed by the author (like this reader's favorite author, H. Rider Haggard, Verne had been a law student before dedicating himself full-time to writing), it is decided that the money will be split between the two. Sarrasin, after a period of five years, succeeds in constructing his model city, dubbed Frankville, on the coast of southern Oregon, while Schultz uses his 10 million pounds to build the world's largest munitions factory, Stahlstadt (German for \"Steeltown\"), on the other side of Oregon's Cascade Mountains. But unfortunately for Dr. Sarrasin and the thousands of peaceful folks living in his little utopia, Schultz turns out to be quite the madman indeed, toiling ceaselessly to invent weapons of unprecedented deadliness, with which to wipe the model city off the map....In \"The Begum's Fortune,\" Verne not only foresees the German empire (as exemplified by Schultz) as a dangerously belligerent world power, but predicts the use of such wartime weapons as incendiary bombs and deadly gas. (Schultz does not use mustard gas, as would be seen in the WW1 trenches 35 years later, but rather liquid CO2 bombs that freeze their victims to death!) In this book the author also predicts man-made satellites being shot into outer space, as well as a primitive telephone and videoconferencing arrangement. His description of a telephone that \"stereographs\" information directly to newspapers, however, was a little harder for this reader to envisage. Care is taken by the author to contrast the totalitarian setup of the nightmarish and grimy Stahlstadt to the sparkling and airy Frankville, and one entire chapter is given over to detailing all the sanitary, architectural, social, dietary, educational and civic innovations that Verne felt were necessary for a healthful life. It\u2019s some pretty fascinating stuff, really.Schultz, I should add, is a wonderful \"bad guy\"--practically a prototype for the 007 villain--who grows more and more demented as the book proceeds; his ultimate fate is both haunting and memorable. In a speech that could almost be plopped down into an Ian Fleming thriller, Schultz at one point declares \"...we act in just the opposite way from the founders of Frankville. We search for the secret of abridging the lives of men, whilst they seek to lengthen them....\" You've gotta love it! \"The Begum's Fortune\" features any number of wonderful sequences, perhaps the two finest being when Max Bruckmann (the Alsacian best friend of Dr. Sarrasin's son, Otto) goes undercover to spy on the Stahlstadt operations (a bravura segment that comprises a full third of the book), and the scene in which Max returns to the munitions city with Otto and battles Schultz's hulking bodyguards, Sigimer and Arminius, before encountering the evil professor one last time. It is an exciting book, capped with a shoehorned-in romantic ending (for the ladies?), and one that should surely please most readers.All of which is not to say that the book does not come with some regrettable problems. Verne can justly be accused of racism in this novel (the Chinese coolies who had constructed Frankville are not permitted to live there, as they \"would otherwise have infallibly lowered the tone and standard of the new city\") and of buying into any number of stereotypes (the German people are all sauerkraut and sausage lovers; the English have no ear for music; the French are \"the most perfect dancers in the world\"). The author also gets some basic facts wrong here. He tells us that one Stahlstadt mine shaft is 1,800 feet deep, or \"14 times the height of the Great Pyramid.\" But since the Great Pyramid is just under 500 feet tall, shouldn't that be more like 'four times the height\"? He also tells us at one point that 10,000 yards (30,000 feet) is equal to nine miles. Wouldn't nine miles be at least 45,000 feet? He also has a notification bell in Frankville ring, at 8:30, for a town meeting to convene. The crowd takes 45 minutes to assemble, and the meeting then commences at...8:30?!?! Finally, Verne mentions that the capital of California is San Francisco, whereas it had been Sacramento in name for quite a while previous to 1879, and in actual fact starting in 1879.But quibbles aside, \"The Begum's Fortune,\" as I\u2019ve said, is generally satisfying, and should especially appeal to fans of that old Western/espionage/sci-fi '60s TV show \"The Wild, Wild West.\" And finally, the book contains a wonderful statement by Dr. Sarrasin, which almost negates that coolie comment just alluded to; a statement that all members of the current Trump administration would do well to consider. Regarding Frankville, Sarrasin declares \"...We will invite visitors from every nation; we will offer it as a home and refuge for honest families forced to emigrate from over-populated countries....\" Bravo, Monsieur Verne!(This review, by the way, originally appeared on the FanLit website at http://www.fantasyliterature.com/ ... a most ideal destination for all fans of Jules Verne....)"}, {"userName": "Dr Osama", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55219494-dr-osama", "userReview": "\u0627\u0644\u062e\u0645\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0626\u0629 \u0645\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0646 \u062b\u0631\u0648\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u062c\u0648\u0645 \u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u0643\u0627\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u0646\u0633\u064a \u062c\u0648\u0646 \u0641\u064a\u0631\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0648\u0641\u0649 \u0641\u064a \u0628\u062f\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0646. \u0648\u0647\u064a \u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u062e\u064a\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0629 \u062a\u062c\u0631\u064a \u0623\u062d\u062f\u0627\u062b\u0647\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0627\u0633\u0639 \u0639\u0634\u0631. \u062a\u062d\u0643\u064a \u0642\u0635\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0643\u062a\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u0646\u0633\u064a \u0633\u0627\u0631\u0627\u0632\u0627\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0631\u0648\u0641\u064a\u0633\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0634\u0648\u0644\u062a\u0632 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0630\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u0632\u0644\u062a \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647\u0645 \u062b\u0631\u0648\u0629 \u0647\u0627\u0626\u0644\u0629 \u0628\u0635\u0641\u062a\u0647\u0645\u0627 \u0648\u0631\u062b\u0629 \u0628\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u0628\u0639\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u0628\u064a\u062c\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0629. \u0648\u064a\u0642\u0631\u0631 \u0643\u0644 \u0645\u0646\u0647\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0631 \u062d\u0635\u062a\u0647 \u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u0645\u0634\u0631\u0648\u0639 \u0647\u0627\u0626\u0644 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u062d\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a\u0629. \u064a\u0624\u0633\u0633 \u0634\u0648\u0644\u062a\u0632 \u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u0633\u062a\u0627\u0644\u0633\u062a\u064a\u062f -

A French doctor (Sarrasin) and a German professor (Schulze)inherit shares in an immense Indian fortune.Both create ideal communities in Oregon (but legallyautonomous). The Frenchman's community, Frankville, is a peaceful, artistic, fanatically hygenic community. (One point Verne makes, which modern medicine seems now to be realizing, is that concentrating sick people together in large hospitals increases the spread of infections.) The German's city, Stahlstadt, is a vast industrial complex with its own coal mines and steel foundries, devoted to producingever larger and more effective weapons, especially cannon.Max Bruckmann, an Alsatian loyal to the French, infiltratesthe German city and learns Schulze's plans for destroyingFrankville; he then escapes by a very neatly foreshadowed variation on the old swim-through-the flooded-tunnel trick, and returns to organize the defense of Frankville. Schulze'sfirst attack fails by an unlikely error, and then Schulze vanishes, abruptly ending the great struggle before it has really begun. At first the people of Stahlstadt are merely confused, but later they all seem to have abandoned the town.(there is a very awkward sudden transition).

When I was young, probably pre-teen, I'd read the famous ones: A Journey to the Center of the Earth, 20,000 Leagues under the Sea, Around the World in Eighty Days, & the less famous Master of the World. Later I discovered the more obscure Lighthouse at the End of the World & the 'lost novel' Paris in the Twentieth Century. Maybe I even read the short bio by Franz Born: The Man Who Invented the Future. But recently I was pleasantly surprised to find 8 more novels by him that I'd never heard of, all part of the \"Fitzroy\" Edition edited by I. O. Evans, so I plucked them up & decided to read them in chronological order starting w/ this one. \"The intention of this new edition [new in 1958, ie] of one of the greatest writers is to make it as comprehensive as possible, and to include his lesser-known, as well as his most popular works.\" (p 192) Perfect! I'm interested in the \"lesser-known\" works. The intro by Evans states that: \"\"Jules Verne\" said H. G. Wells, \"made some remarkable forecasts\" and some of the most remarkable are contained in this book. Yet, as Wells explained, they had a factual basis; and here it was the Franco-Prussian War. This not only brought home to Verne the menace of German militarism but made him realize what war might become when throughly mechanized.\" [..] \"So, perhaps, he derived the idea of the two rival cities, and Dickens' Bleak House suggested a plausible device for bringing them into being.* *From Dickens, too, he gained another idea which he used in a tale of adventure published a little before The Begum's Fortune: a savage chieftain in Dick Sands the Boy Captain dies, though more plausibly than a character in Bleak House, of spontaneous combustion!\" Bleak House being my favorite Dickens novel that perked up my interest. The intro continues w/: \"He was probably the first to envisage the launching of an artificial satellite; and this may conceivably end, as he showed it as beginning, as a war-weapon.\" I'm, of course, reminded of the satellite-based aspects of the Strategic Defense Initiative announced on March 23, 1983, by then-President Reagan. \"He foresaw, too, the dangers of long-range bombardment with gas shells and showers of incendiary bombs, and the attempts which would be made to counteract them by mass evacuation schemes and the formation of a Civil Defence Service provided with fire-fighting equipment. \"He regarded other developments as even more disquieting than such weapons: the attempt of German militarism to dominate the world and the rise of a totalitarian state, rigidly directing its people's lives and infested by political police. Here it is significant that the illustrations of Herr Schultz, in the original French edition of this book, resemble a portrait of Bismarck deprived of his moustache!\" - p 6 & all those foresights are nothing to write off as trivial! Let's say this bk predicts nazism. It was written in 1879. Cd you write something NOW, in 2013, that wd foresee a particular political event in, say 2075? This was written 35 yrs before Heinrich Mann's Little Superman, the other main novel that I can think of that predicts nazism (see my review here: http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44... ). All in all, I thought this was great. Verne makes fun of pompous ranking titles & otherwise shows an appreciation for more democratized ways of doing things. Nonetheless, I've only given this bk a 3 star rating b/c he also still has plenty of racist & classist dregs in his approach that undermine his egalitarianism. Early on, he describes the way a person's having an abundance of money wrongly influences people's perception of that person. Fair enuf. But then he writes: \"Had he been a humpbacked dwarf, an ignorant Hottentot, the lowest specimen of humanity, instead of one of its most intelligent representatives, his value would have been the same as Lord Glandover had expressed it, he \"was worth\" henceforth just twenty-one million pounds, no more and no less.\" (pp 35-36) A \"humpbacked dwarf\" is not necessarily a so-called inferior being. Nor is a \"Hottentot\" - wch was an offensive name at the time for a member of the Khoikhoin, a pastoral people of Namibia and South Africa. Verne is highly offended by the German devaluing of the French but has no problem devaluing Africans in pretty much the same way. Alas, many aspects of this bk run along similar lines. A main character of the bk, A Frenchman, thru no effort of his own, inherits a HUGE fortune from a distant relative who was imperialistically lording it over the natives in India. Verne doesn't question the justice of this at all. Instead, he has the lucky man enhanced to heroic proportions b/c he makes a seemingly humanitarian proposal: \"\"Why should we not, by uniting the powers of our minds, produce the plan of a model city, based upon strictly scientific principles?\" (Cries of \"Her, Hear.\") \"Why should we not afterwards devote our capitol to the erection of such a city, and then present it to the world as a practical illustration of what all cities ought to be?\" (Hear, Hear! and thunders of applause.)\" - p 38 The villain, Professor Schultz, then comes into the picture, attempting to wrest the Frenchman's inheritance from him by consulting w/ the English lawyer who's arranged it: \"His aim was to demonstrate to this Englishman, this Mr. Sharp, that by rights the German race should, in all things, predominate over all others. His object in putting forth a claim to this inheritance was chiefly that it might be snatched from french hands, which could not fail to make absurd use of it. What he hated in his rival was his nationality. Had he been a German he certainly should not have interfered, etc., etc.\" If there weren't so much 20th century history of Germany attacking France this wd seem like another unfortunate stereotype. Alas, tho, even that is probably a bit historically inaccurate given that it was France that declared war on Germany in the Franco-Prussian War in Verne's lifetime that was partial inspiration for this bk. Verne even takes a dig at law-suits (w/ the relevance of Bleak House thusly appearing) by parodying the solicitor Sharp's profit motive when considering Schultz's claim to the money: \"But this relationship, being in a secondary degree to that of Doctor Sarrasin, would give only secondary rights to the inheritance. The solicitor perceived, however, the possibility of lawfully sustaining them, and in this possibility he foresaw another which would be much to the advantage of Billows, Green, and Sharp, something which would change the Lang\u00e9vol affair, already productive, into a very good thing, indeed, a second case of the \"Jarndyce versus Jarndyce\" of Dickens. An extensive horizon of stamped paper, deeds, documents of all sorts, rose before the yes of the man of law; and, what was even more enticing, he saw a compromise conducted by himself, Sharp, to the interest of both his clients, which would equally bring to himself honour and profit.\" - p 47 Sarrasin's plan of a model city is mocked by Schultz, whose negative perception of it is based on his notion of the superiority of the German people. Again, given that this novel's from 1879, what Verne has Schultz thinking, saying, & doing is eerily prescient of nazism. So eerily prescient, in fact, that it's bizarre to think that there was this much advance warning: \"He thought this enterprise absurd and to his mind it was sure to fail, as it opposed the law of progress, which decreed the uprooting of the Latin race, its subjection to the Saxon, and at last its disappearance from the surface of the globe. However, these results might be held in check if the doctor started to carry out his programme and even more so, if there were any prospect of its success. It was, therefore, the duty of every true Saxon, in the interest of general order, to obey this appointed law, and bring this insane enterprise to nothing - if he could. In the circumstances it was quite clear that he, Schultz, M.D.., privat docent of chemistry in Jena University, known by his numerous works on the different human races - works in which it was proved that the German race was to absorb all others - it was quite clear that he was especially designed by the great creative and destructive forces of nature to annihilate the pigmies who were struggling against it.\" (p 54) Substitute Aryan for Saxon & Jewish for Latin & you've got a pretty typical taste of nazi propaganda. Verne seems to further his peaceful notions in his grim depictions of the arms manufacturing city that Schultz then goes on to have built: \"In five years there sprang up on this bare and rocky plain eighteen villages, composed of small wooden houses, all alike, brought ready-built from Chicago, and containing a large population of rough workmen. \"In the midst of these villages, at the very foot of the Coal Butts, as the inexhaustible mountains of coal are called, rises a dark mass, huge, and strange, an agglomeration of regular-shaped buildings, pierced with symmetrical windows, covered with red roofs, and surrounded by a forest of cylindrical chimneys, which continually vomit forth clouds of dense smoke. Through the black curtain which veils the sky dart red lightning-like flames, while a distant roaring resembles that of thunder or the beating of the surf on a rocky shore.\" (pp 57-58) I write that \"Verne seems to further his peaceful notions\" in the above b/c that doesn't necessarily turn out to be true later on. However, while this review has some spoilers I don't wan to give it all away. After all, this is a fairly entertaining novel, worth reading even despite my criticisms. Interestingly, in Schultz's city there's something reminiscent of Centralia, Pennsylvania (& many, MANY other places): \"not far from the spot was a coal mine permanently on fire\". (p 89) Schultz's megalomania is depicted: \"The truth was that Max had. at first glance seen through the character of his formidable patron, and perceiving that blind and insatiable vanity was its leading feature, he regulated his conduct by humouring the egotism which he despised. / In a dew days the young man had acquired such skill in the fingering necessary for this human keyboard, that he could play upon Schultz as easily as one plays on a piano.\" (pp 91-92) Of course, the \"In a dew days\" is a typo in the bk & shd read \"In a few days\". I rather like it so I think I'll treat it as a 'happy accident' & exploit it a little in this review. In the dew course of the narrative, we're treated to a Verne the Frenchman's disdain for German cooking: \"\"Those sausages were delicious, weren't they?\" remarked Herr Schultz, whose love of his favorite dish was unaffected by the Begum's millions. / \"Delicious!\" returned Max, who had heroically partaken of this mess every evening, till at last he hated the very sight of it.\" (p 94) In dew time at all, we even get to gassing, that nightmare of diabolical human invention so heavily associated w/ WWI & II: \"An enormous volume of carbonic acid gas rushes into the air, and a cold of a hundred degrees below zero seizes upon the surrounding atmosphere. Every living thing within a radius of thirty yards from the centre of the explosion is at once frozen and suffocated.\" (p 100) Various implausibilities mar the story slightly. As in so many stories of this kind w/ heavy 'good'-guy-vs-'bad'-guy action, the 'bad' guy often prolongs the execution of his enemy in a completely unbelievable way so that the 'good' guy can ultimately, of course, make his escape. The coordinates of Sarrasin's model city are given: \"\"The place where the new city now stands was five years ago a complete desert. The exact spot lies 43\u00ba 11' 3\" north latitude, and 124\u00ba 41' 17\" west longitude. \"\"\"It will be seen that this is on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, and at the foot of the secondary chain of the Rocky Mountains, called the Cascade Mountains, sixty miles to the north of White Cape, Oregon State, North America.[\"]\" - p 119 In 1879, that are of North America must've seemed like extreme wilderness. That got me wondering what's there now. The result I got from http://itouchmap.com/latlong.html is actually IN the Pacific Ocean off Coos Bay in Oregon. Alas, this model city, this exemplar of how the world shd live, is built by \"an army of twenty thousand Chinese coolies, under the direction of five hundred overseers and European engineers\". (p 120) & in the German newspaper that's reporting on this model city there's a curiously conflicted reporting on these \"coolies\": \"Several states had, in the interest of their own population, actually expelled these unfortunate people en masse.\" [..] \"The wages were deposited every week, in the presence of delegates in the great bank of San Francisco, and every coolie was warned that when he drew it out he was not to return. This precaution was absolutely necessary to get rid of a yellow population, which would have infallibly lowered the tone and standard of the new city.\" (p 121) So is this description of a 'Yellow Peril' an invention of the racist German newspaper or an unquestioned part of the 'model city'? It's hard to tell from the story but at least the 'coolies' are still thre after the building of the city judging from this description from 5 yrs later after the city's established: \"Gangs of coolies banked up the earth, dug trenches\" etc. Never, however, are these Chinamen ever mentioned in any context other than as laborers. A 5,000 yr old civilization & all the Chinese are good for is labor? What's wrong w/ this picture? Much of this bk is just Verne's excuse for providing a description of what he imagines to be an ideal city. It doesn't really seem that appealing to me. Take, eg, \"The plan of the town is essentially simple and regular, the roads crossing at right angles, at equal distances, of a uniform width, planted with trees, and numbered\" & \"They are also accustomed to such strict cleanliness that they consider a spot on their simple clothes quite a disgrace.\" (p 125) But back in the arms manufacturing town, things are even worse: \"Invested with almost absolute power over their subordinates, they were each, in regard to Herr Schultz - as they were in regard to his memory - like so many human tools, without authority, without ability to show initiative or any voice in anything. Each ensconced himself within the narrow limits of his duty, waited, temporized, and watched the course of events.\" (p 160) Nonetheless, one of the remarkable charms of this novel is that it seems to've been written in the 20th century until one gets to passages like this: \"The wisest and most prudent among the workmen, those who has foreseen hard times and had laid by for a rainy day, hastened to escape with bag and baggage; and happy rosy-cheeked children, wild with delight at the new world revealed to them, peeped through the curtains of the departing waggons\". (p 162) Yes, \"waggons\", we're back in the 19th century. Verne does dabble w/ class references, but in the usual bourgeois way. In response to impending war, the \"common danger had united the citizens more closely. All classes had been brought nearer to each other and knew themselves to be brothers, animated with the same feelings, and affected by the same interests.\" (p 165) So why are their classes at all? Presumably, even in this 'model city' it's like the English Civil War: the bourgeoisie unites w/ the laborers to knock the aristocracy down a notch &.. then.. it's back to business-as-usual. But Verne isn't completely w/o political sense: \"For indeed, isn't the best government the one where the chief, when he dies can be most easily replaced, and which will go on working smoothly, just because all the machinery is open and visible?\"\" (p 184) Of course, from my anarchist perspective, the 'need' for a government or a chief are both delusional."}, {"userName": "Sezgi", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20819137-sezgi", "userReview": "Jules Verne tarihi \u015fahsiyetler aras\u0131nda a\u00e7\u0131k farkla hayran oldu\u011fum birisi.

The exploration of dystopia vs. utopia in the Pacific Northwest is what could bring this book back into readership, though it may be countered by the more disappointing elements (e.g. some racially prejudiced sentiments by the characters, including from the \"good guys\").

The story In \u201cThe Begum\u2019s Fortune\u201d (published in 1879) deals with two confrontational cultures, that of technocratic German militarism under a despotic oligarch and peaceable French democratic altruism instigated by a magnanimous philanthropist. Being aware that Verne was a Frenchman can help the reader to understand how he stereotypically casts the German Herr Schultz as the militant technocrat. French cultural icons at that time cast suspicious eyes across the border at German military ambitions. France had just lost the Franco-Prussian war in 1871 in which Germany annexed Alsace-Lorraine.So, here we have two cities established in the new world (Oregon), the utopian Frankville and the dystopian Stahlstadt [Steel City], located near each other but founded and operated with two completely opposite philosophies. As the story develops, the French hero (ironically an Alsacian) Max Bruckmann infiltrates Stahlstadt by stealth. With his genius for technology and design Max becomes employed and eventually gains the full confidence of Herr Schultz who confides to him his most diabolical schemes of destruction. Max then feels compelled to rescue Frankville from imminent and total destruction.Verne\u2019s narrative is straightforward, and by today\u2019s standards rather contrived and stunted. But we must remember that it was written for people of all ages, many with little education or sophistication. Critics often ignored his fantastic science-based musings that couldn\u2019t be regarded in the same vein as serious literature. But most people loved his novels and he has become the second most translated writer of all time. I, like many others a century and a half later, enjoy Verne\u2019s adventurous tales and the themes that he interwove to state his conscientious beliefs about social issues. On many fronts he foresaw the advancement of future scientific and technological inventions. For example, Schultz\u2019s super cannons, described in this novel, were perhaps precursors to the siege artillery, like the Karl Ger\u00e4t, having 24 inch calibre and a range of up to 60 km, developed by the Nazis in the 1930s and 40s for use against the French and the Soviets."}, {"userName": "Piedra Libro", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43326271-piedra-libro", "userReview": "Fue realmente muy bueno haber vuelto a leer a un grande de la literatura como es Verne. \"Los quinientos millones...\" es una historia llena de intriga y de conflictos.

Como en dos mentes igual de brillantes, vemos una que puede abogar en favor del bienestar de la especie y del mundo, y otra con ideales totalmente opuestos a eso.Tambi\u00e9n hay lugar para el amor y el romance en una dosis justa que no interfiere en la trama principal pero que aporta al todo de la narraci\u00f3n. Personalmente creo que esa parte emocional de los personajes le suma una dimensi\u00f3n m\u00e1s a aspectos donde la l\u00f3gica y el razonamiento puro no son suficientes para llevar a cabo actos que conlleven consecuencias para toda la poblaci\u00f3n.Altamente recomendable. Esperaba bastante de esta obra y me dio mucho m\u00e1s."}, {"userName": "Max", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28246698-max", "userReview": "Some more Jules Verne before I continue Peter the Great/First. Once again a well designed book complete with some illustrations, written for all ages and a enjoyable story. Less adventurous although still thrilling. It follows the story of two intellectuals receiving a large sum of money. One a french and one a german. Jules Verne was a french writer and in the time living Germany was not really making a great name for itself. Both individuals create an utopian city rather close to each other, the french' is morally perfect created from a viewpoint that cares a LOT about hygiene, which was poor in these days in most cities. The germanic is one to help the germans to conquer the world, in which he heavenly believes, manufacturing weapons and steel with military discipline. The book circles around the theme that the french are good, the germans bad and this reflects in everything. Stereotypes are flooding the text which would raise an eye or two if written nowadays. The ending was rather perfect for the protagonist, but its a story after all. In which, it is a pretty good one."}, {"userName": "Mathieu", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5912137-mathieu", "userReview": "Pas le meilleur Jules Verne que j'ai lu...Une histoire d'h\u00e9ritage o\u00f9 deux savants, l'un fran\u00e7ais, l'autre allemand, se voient l\u00e9guer 525 millions de francs par une b\u00e9gum...

It starts as if setting up a family drama about the dangers of a sudden influx of money, switches to utopian fiction before morphing into a James Bond style espionage thriller. The basic premise is that a frenchman and a german both inherit an obscene amount of money, naturally (because Verne is french) the former uses his to help all mankind while the latter attempts to exterminate the former as a prelude to taking over the world. It seems pretty insulting to the germans until you remember that whole Hitler thing, then it just seems prophetic. However despite one side being composed of nazi's its still hard to entirely sympathize with our supposed heroes who show their own brand racism and sexism. Its a bit short and anti-climactic but interesting."}, {"userName": "Andreea H", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51782388-andreea-h", "userReview": "This is actually my first Jules Verne book I've read as an adult and it wasn't so bad.

Son fils, Octave, est un etudiant moyen de l'Ecole centrale. Il s'est lie d'amitie a Marcel Bruckmann, qui est un etudiant brillant et qui sert de mentor pour Octave. En apprenant la nouvelle de l'heritage, Octave est rempli de joie, alors que Marcel est plus reserve sur cette nouvelle. Pendant ce temps, le docteur Sarrasin, toujours a Brighton, decide d'utiliser l'argent pour la construction d'une cite modele basee sur les principes scientifiques, Franceville. La nouvelle de cet heritage se repand dans l'Europe et jusqu'au professeur Schultze, professeur allemand antifrancais, qui pretend lui aussi a l'heritage. En se rendant en Angleterre, un accord est trouve: l'heritage est divise entre les deux hommes. Cinq ans plus tard, Johann Schwartz (qui est en fait Marcel Bruckmann) se fait engager comme ouvrier a Stahlstadt, la cite de l'acier et cite personnelle du professeur Schultze. Stahlstadt est une immense cite dediee a la construction de canons. Johann espionne le professeur afin de s'assurer que celui-ci n'a pas de mauvaises intentions contre France-Ville. Par son travail applique, Marcel reussi a devenir le collegue de travail et confident du professeur allemand. Celui-ci lui devoile alors son projet: il veut detruire France-Ville grace a un nouveau canon tirant un enorme obus. Malheureusement, Marcel est condamne a mort par le professeur pour avoir eu connaissance de son macabre projet. Marcel s'echappe alors de Stahlstadt et part prevenir Franceville du plan machiavelique du professeur Schultze, mais l'obus tire par le canon de Stahlstadt et destine a detruire Franceville a acquis une telle vitesse qu'il ne peut retomber: il devient le premier satellite artificiel de la Terre. Quelques jours plus tard, la Bourse de San Francisco annonce que Stahlstadt ne paie plus ses creanciers faute d'argent. De plus, le professeur est annonce disparu. Marcel, accompagne d'Octave, se rend a Stahlstadt pour essayer de comprendre ce qu'il est advenu du professeur. Ils decouvrent ce dernier mort par un de ses engins de destruction. Marcel propose alors de reprendre Stahlstadt et d'en faire un centre de production pour les industries utiles, dirige par Marcel.
