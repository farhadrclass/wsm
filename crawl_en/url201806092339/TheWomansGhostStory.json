I'd have given this story four stars, if not for the old-timey sexism. I don't care if it's a product of the times, that doesn't increase my enjoyment.A woman, briefly (oh, but she rambles, because that's what women do, haha!), tells a story of meeting a ghost. All he asks is she love him, and she only consents because, well, she is a modern woman and can make that choice (ah, how droll, she thinks she's people!).The twist at the end and the notion of a ghost needing love is fascinating enough that I would have loved this story WITHOUT Blackwood constantly making fun of his subject!Available as a free audio production from Tales to Terrify."}, {"userName": "Marna", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25490451-marna", "userReview": "Is it sad that - even though I try and avoid anything about pop culture - especially music, I automatically thought about Keisha when I read this, even though I don't know anything about her, other than she claims to have fucked a ghost. Anyway, I was surprised to really like his stuff after having a really hard time getting through 'The Wendigo' mostly because I was goaded into reading it and I have a hard time with things that are required or that I am being goaded into reading. But this was was sentimental and stupid. Probably because Blackwood was - for all I have really been unsettled by a few of his short stories - a man. A lot of these male writers, I always think of that part in As Good as it Gets when, after being asked how he writes women so well, the Jack Nicholson character says 'I think of a man - then I take away reason and accountability.' Any idiot that believes their souls to be just overflowing with love because they happen to have ovaries would love a story like this. Of course, I am pretty sure women were kind of encouraged to see themselves as tender-hearted morons, so Blackwood can hardly be faulted for this."}], "description": "Classic Ghost Stories - The Woman's Ghost Story by Algernon Blackwood \"Yes,\" she said, from her seat in the dark corner, \"I'll tell you an experience if you care to listen. And, what's more, I'll tell it briefly, without trimmings--I mean without unessentials. That's a thing story-tellers never do, you know,\" she laughed. \"They drag in all the unessentials and leave their listeners to disentangle; but I'll give you just the essentials, and you can make of it what you please. But on one condition: that at the end you ask no questions, because I can't explain it and have no wish to.\" We agreed. We were all serious. After listening to a dozen prolix stories from people who merely wished to \"talk\" but had nothing to tell, we wanted \"essentials.\" \"In those days,\" she began, feeling from the quality of our silence that we were with her, \"in those days I was interested in psychic things, and had arranged to sit up alone in a haunted house in the middle of London. It was a cheap and dingy lodging-house in a mean street, unfurnished. I had already made a preliminary examination in daylight that afternoon, and the keys from the caretaker, who lived next door, were in my pocket. The story was a good one--satisfied me, at any rate, that it was worth investigating; and I won't weary you with details as to the woman's murder and all the tiresome elaboration as to why the place was alive.
