Pack him with a huge \"tool\"6. He has to like rough sex7. Make him extremely protective of his woman8. Show his sensitive side in at least one chapter9. Have him save the day in a bombastic fashion10. Have a heroine in the book, one that doesn't get on the nervesThis book was on FIRE! Wow, I loved it like crazy! Will definitely be stalking this author for more!!!!!!!!!\"One moment she was standing beside him, shivering in anticipation. The next she was bent over the desk, her shoes, jeans and panties gone, leaving her lower half naked and entirely vulnerable to the two-hundred-plus pounds of sexed male directly behind her.\"\nThe storyDiskant is the Omega of all the shifter races, he can transform into any kind of animal at will. He's basically the shifter king :D Yep, awesome :DDDSo, one night he saves a young woman from being taken by some vampires, and realises his inner animals crave her like crazy. That could mean only one thing - she is his mate, the one he's been waiting for for ages :DAva, poor thing, doesn't know any of this, so when she wakes up in his room, in his bed, she kinda freaks, which leads to a very hot sexy scene with both of them in a closet *panting*Anyway, she runs away and he goes crazy searching for her, and when he finds her... Oh. My. :DDD Lucky woman indeed :))))) \n\n\u201cIn thirty seconds I\u2019m going to carry you to the bedroom, drape you across the bed and see if you taste as good as you smell. If you want out, now\u2019s the time to say so.\u201d\n\nThis was the first book and an introduction to the whole world in the series, lots of characters that I suppose will have their own books later on (and I can't wait to read them!!!), some bad guys and a hint of new bad guys to come :))The paranormal world here has shifters, vampires and warlocks/mages or whatever magical beings they are :) it's a mix of everything, but it didn't bother me at all having all those together, especially knowing those will mix in between in the new books :)The bad guys are a bunch of crazy maniacs and are pretty terrible, but it's believable and I was Ok with it :)The characters - kinda sneaky, making me crazy wanting to read about a bunch of them, only with the first book!!! But I will go crazy! I need Trey's book ASAP! And if Kinsley doesn't get his own, I just might stalk the author until she writes one ahahahhahahahhahahhahahahaA Scottish black panther shifter with a brogue and long black hair??????????? Must!!! Be!!!! Written!!!!!!!!!!The writing is great, and the sex scenes HOT! Very hot, I don't even need to tell you how much I liked it ahahahhahahh\n\n\u201cOh, kitten.\u201d His eyes shifted to that vivid shade of jeweled emerald and he smiled mischievously. \u201cYou turn me on when you\u2019re angry.

I don't even have to tell you how dominant he is hahhahah but I just loved him! He's bossy and he knows what he wants, and man does he know how to dirty talk! Yum :DDDiskant knows Ava is his mate, he would do anything for her, and it shows in the book :) I'm not a fan of insta-love, but with PNR it's more believable, especially with those mating bonds, so yeah :) I believed it, and loved it :)The scene when Ava was hurt... So so well written! Loved Diskant and everything that he felt and thought! *sigh*\n\nShe lifted her head and glimpsed the wounded look in his eyes, saw the hurt in his face.\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of me.\u201d His voice was hoarse, the words raspy. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of us.\u201d\n\nAva is not a typical human, she's a telepath, but one that can only read humans, not shifters or any other paranormal race. That's how she knew Diskant was different from the start. She isn't willing to jump blindly into his world, or accept the fact that they're supposed to be mates, considering she knows nothing about him, I liked that too :D BUT! Diskant has a way of persuading her *cough*sex*cough*, so she falls for him pretty quickly, especially when the first step of the mating bond is formed :)))I liked how she had a role in the end and used her telepathic abilities :)\n\n\u201cLike this?\u201d he asked and pressed into her wet heat, stretching and possessing her, inch by maddening inch.\u201cYes.

What a book! I LOVED IT! Omega Mine had me riveted and enthralled from the first page to the last. Aline Hunter has created a multifaceted and gritty paranormal world with a solid and intriguing plot, richly developed characters, and a provocative, explicitly erotic, and enticing love story.In fact, what I loved the most about this book was the way the author constructed the relationship between the hero and heroine. It was refreshing and satisfying to read about a couple who did not fight their feeling or connection for each other throughout the book. Almost from the start, they embraced those feelings and connections and worked together as a team. I loved it!The paranormal world, while at times confused me\u2013I'm not that knowledgeable about mythical creatures (werewolves, vampires, witches, ect.) and their respective folklore\u2013was full of well developed, engaging, and at times rampage secondary characters. The complex, dark, action packed, and somewhat violent storyline was fascinating and made it difficult for me to put the book down. The author wrapped up Diskant and Ava's personal story nicely by giving the reader their HEA, while leaving lose ends in the form of an overall plot cliffhanger to entice the reader to find out what happens next. I've found another favorite author in Aline Hunter. Her style of writing and the way she portrays romantic relationships really works for me."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6010839-lisa", "userReview": "I absolutely LOVE going into a book not really knowing what to expect only to be pleasantly surprised at how fan-freakin-tastic the book is! Just love it when that happens. Makes me all giddy!So, suffice it to say, I loved Omega Mine by Aline Hunter! This was my first book by this author and I am happy to report that I have now found another series that I love and am invested in. WHOOP!Ava Brisbane works at a bar, is dealing with a jack-ass for a brother who seems to be selling off her parents' belongings left to the two of them when they died, and she simply wants to live her life and not deal with all the shit being thrown her way. She has a unique ability to read the minds of humans and is very aware that other \"beings\" co-exist with humans although she is unable to tap into their thoughts. Ava wants her locket back, the one left to her by her parents, and the one her poor excuse for a brother pawned to pay off his debts. One attack in a dark alley way leaves her vulnerable and in the hands of vampires only to be saved by New York's omega shifter, Diskant Black.As a heroine, I absolutely loved Ava and admired the fact that she had a lot of spunk. She could be snarky at times and held her own against the powerful omega shifter hell bent on claiming her. As her relationship with Diskant progressed we begin to see that Ava is truly the right mate for Diskant. She calls out to the beasts within him and calms them and her telekinetic abilities make her a useful asset to the pack.It also goes without saying that I loved Diskant. Hmmm, hmmm.I love it when authors give me a powerful, sexy, very alpha male to obsess and drool over. Diskant is definitely an oh so sexy shifter who is worthy of panty dropping. Did I just say that? Ok, moving on! Diskant hears the cries of a woman in distress and as he makes his way to the location of the cries, he discovers a woman being taken by some vampires. Never being a male who would turn his back on a female in distress, he goes about saving the said female. Once he sets his eyes on the petite female he has just saved all he sees is MINE and MATE! Yes, Diskant has finally found his mate and he is determined to claim her, whether she likes it or not. \n\"If you don't watch it, I'm going to rip those clothes back off, put you face down on the desk and make them wait even longer.\"\"Promises, promises.\"\"Just wait until I really get you alone.\"\nThe relationship between Diskant and Ava is explosive and very hot! Diskant knows what he wants and starts a slow sensual dance with Ava leaving her breathless and in no doubt of who she belongs too. Did she really have a chance in rejecting Mr. Powerful Shifter Dude with sex appeal that is off the freakin charts? Um ..... NO! One look from him and her clothes simply go away. Poof!Yes, Omega Mine is an erotic tale, but there is also a great storyline that goes with all the crazy ass monkey sex our hero and heroine have! The shifters are being targeted by a religious faction and danger is lurking. We get a hero and a heroine who work together and Ms. Hunter does an incredible job with the world building and keeps the reader in suspense with the plot line. Further, the author also does a stellar job setting up the next two books in the series. I am so excited to read the next book and will be anxiously awaiting book 3.Omega Mine is an explosive start to what I think will be an amazing series! It's full of heart-dropping alpha males, pretty great sexual romps and a plot line that will keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\"Pinkie.\" He placed the pad of his index finger over her mouth. \"There is nothing more important in this world to me than you and there never will be.

From here on in, it\u2019s going to be one hell of a ride.\u201d\n\nCan I just say, I swooned every freaking time he said \u201cAva mine\u201d. Coming from a 200 pound possessive Alpha Omega there was just something so sweet, tender and HAWT. Ava keeps to herself, knowing she is special but never truly realizing what it all means. Time and time again she has had to bail out her brother but this was the last time. All she wanted was to get her family locket back but not when it would cost her, her life. Thanks to her dark savior she gets to breathe again, but who would save her from him?!? He is everything she craves but can\u2019t have. It\u2019s impossible for a human and a shifter to mate, let alone an Omega, right?\n\nHe knew he was fucked the minute he lifted her in his arms and all the beasts beneath his skin growled in contentment, each one brushing against the inside of his skin. They came at the same time, fighting for a place to break free and make their own unique mark of claim.\n\nDiskant couldn\u2019t believe his luck; it is rare to find your mate, especially one who is quite as unique as his Pinkie, Ava. He has never met a more infuriating stubborn woman; all he needs is to prove it to her by beginning the process that overrules reason and logic, letting their bodies do the talking. Coming from different worlds, there is a lot she has to come to terms with, lucky for her she can rely on her gift to help get her to a place where she can be at peace with her behavior. A connection like theirs lasts a lifetime, one that will continue to grow stronger. \n\nWhen Diskant touched her there was nothing else. She had no pride, no restraint, no concept of right and wrong. He centered her, grounded her and provided all of the things she needed even when she wasn\u2019t sure what they were.\n\nAs Diskant rushes to build the bond between them to keep her safe from harm, he has to deal with the Shepherds who have come to make all shifters atone for their sins. IN Omega Mine, we meet the different pack members of the New York and getting a little back history for book two and three. Omega Mine had a delicious Alpha Omega, who with his mate had a very insatiable appetite for each other. \n\n\u201cHard, long and thick, filling and stretching me so that I can\u2019t feel anything else but you, inside and out.\u201d She flexed her ass and gyrated against him. \u201cPlease. I want to feel what it\u2019s like when you come deep inside me.\u201d \u201cWhatever you want, baby.\u201d\n\nIt was a great paranormal erotic read.

He searches for weeks. During that time there is a brief recollection of him trying to relieve the sexual tension by screwing a willing shifter but he could not because several of the beasts residing within him wanted to kill her. They all recognize Ava as his mate. The recollection was not detailed and I chose to believe it did not go far but there are no details. This bothered me but honestly I got over it quickly because of the circumstances and you have ZERO doubt of his obsession with and devotion to Ava the moment he finds her again. Other than this small paragraph, there is ZERO OW or OM drama.Well she does give a lap dance to his buddy but she did not want to and he never touches her and she never touches him. Long story, but nothing sexual on her part. Friend is turned on, but it is a just a physical response. He was actually trying to help Diskant. Trust me it is not a big deal.There is much talk about shifters being totally ok with PDA and even PDF (public displays of fucking). She is turned on by the idea and he wants to because it is a way to show them who she belongs to, but they never do it. This did not bother me at all, but I know I have some GR friends that may not like this. However, other than heavy make out sessions, they do not indulge.

There is nothing like reading a man take charge *fans self* Diskant is protective, possessive & potent. He was ridiculously sexy, alpha (i know he is an Omega) and a total badass. Ava was interesting, she wasn't a pushover or weak and had some pretty funky abilities. A great female lead. The chemistry was electric & the sex scenes between them were scorching hot. I felt like the relationship wasn't just about the sex & that they could of been a real couple. The story was interesting & it was not predictable, it left me guessing which was a big plus.

Ava is human but she does have some pretty nifty powers of her own. They met when Ava got attacked by vampires and Diskant saves her. Right away he can tell that she is his mate and he takes her home. She is unconscious from the attack but he can hardly contain himself. When she finally awakens, she takes off at the first possible moment. Let me just say that right from the beginning, this book is...It is seriously hot. When Diskant finally finds Ava, he wastes no time in getting horizontal. Ava can hardly wait either...she has been just as affected. There is a fierce mating bond that has three steps and step one is sex. After their first time, things explode and they both want sex All. The. Time. Usually that wouldn't be a problem but there's all kinds of trouble going on. Diskant is one sexy beast and I just loved how protective he was of Ava. It was funny when he didn't know her name and nicknamed her Pinkie from the pink streaks in her hair. Although it was a little weird at first with him carrying her everywhere, after awhile I got used to it. And I about died when the shifters found out where Ava was and when Diskant finally got there, he saw Ava giving Trey a lap dance that Trey liked very much!! \nMy Diskant...\nAva is very strong willed and I really liked that about her. Unfortunately, the mating bond kind of took that away from her. She just became way too accepting of e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g!! I get how her telepathy helped her find out and understand things but I wish it wouldn't have happened so fast. There is a lot going on in this book which is understandable with the author laying the groundwork for the series. It wasn't confusing at all but it still was a lot. Ava has to deal with a brother that's causing her problems, the shifters have to deal with some humans called Shepherds that want to kill all of them, the paranormals have to deal with a group called the Villati that knows all their secrets, there's problems between the shifters and the vampires and oh yea, there's also mages thrown in. And I can't forget to mention all the politics that are going on between all the shifter groups and inside the wolf pack. I got a strong feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu from The Breeds series with the mating bond and especially when the cat shifters show up. Not to mention, AH uses the same terminology that Lora Leigh is infamous for. AH also uses the \"mine\" word which is what's used in the Black Dagger Brotherhood series. It sounded a bit strange at first but I really grew to like it. In the middle of everything going on, you wouldn't think there could possibly be more drama but there is. AH sets up relations for the second and third books with Emory and Mary and Trey and Sadie so we get chapters of what is going on with them. Obviously, we're left hanging with their stories and it only frustrated me because I found them very interesting!All in all, it's a very intriguing story and has quite a few good things going for it. I enjoyed the epilogue and look forward to reading the next book, Enemy Mine.Favorite quotes: \u2665 \u201cHang on, Ava mine.

If Bones couldn't cure me, no one can, right? Wrong! What I needed was a shifter! We all love those alpha men...all levels of alpha-ness, from simple protectiveness to the possessive control freaks we hate to love. I'm tentatively tipping my hat to this book for showing me what I loved about paranormal romance way back when Twilight was my wake-up call. I should have known that a team Jacob girl would get bored with those bloodsuckers ;)Diskant is the Omega of New York. What is an Omega? Well, he's KING...basically. He rules over all of the myriad groups of shifters, from the packs of wolves to the loner cats to the birds of prey. I love that while Diskant has dominion over so many creatures, he can still soften for his woman...after he claims her. And whew! Does he ever claim her! He's torn when he first meets her because that instant knowing that she is his mate throws him for a bit. It takes awhile to accept the fact, and when he finally thinks he can be okay with a human mate, she gets away!! Diskant basically scares the sh!t out of Ava. She knows what the shifter community is like, as she has a little somethin-somethin extra of her own. Only her somethin could get her killed by the very shifter community that Diskant leads. Well, of COURSE that isn't really the case, but her abilities do gain her some enemies...and didn't she just meet Omega mine at the perfect time?One thing I love about shifter stories is the compulsion of the males to be with their females...their innate need to stake their claim, to show the world (and all nearby males) that this woman is special to him. No need to be subtle, boys! A nice fat bite mark on the neck/breast/ thigh will work! The sex is rough, the claiming rougher and I reveled in it! Oh, to make your man lose all control like that...it just gives you permission to do the same. This book was smoking hot! There is plenty of room for growth in this series. I met two more couples with lots of promising chemistry and connection that I'm really excited to read about. Plus, I'm hoping to get more on how Diskant and Ava are holding up in the future.Thanks for the rec, V!

Paranormal erotica done right!This is the book that I wanted Feral Sins to be. It was ridiculously sexy, had a nicely developed shifter world, and an insta-love even a jaded reader like me could get into. And thank GOD we didn't get an annoying, whiny heroine. Ava was just perfect- sexy and confident. She doesn't do any of the things that irritate me in these types of books: She doesn't pout, she doesn't pick silly fights, and she doesn't storm off constantly. The storyline was fast-paced, unexpectedly dark (I had to hurry past some of the more gruesome descriptions), and kept me reading frantically all day long. The book was the right blend of sex and action, enough of each to keep all parts of me interested. One of my favorite parts about the story was the way that Aline Hunter portrayed the relationship between Ava and Diskant. In so many shifter-type books, the heroine is reluctantly dragged into the pairing kicking and screaming. The fighting and the back and forth tends to grate on my nerves. Here, Ava and Diskant feel in sync from the start and truly appreciative of one another. It was really refreshing for me as a reader. Aline Hunter also did an great job of setting the stage for other pairings for the next parts in the series. And you can bet I'm going to read on!! My one criticism, though it is minor, was that Diskant kept calling her...juices...\"cream\". That just icked me out each time that I read it."}, {"userName": "Joana", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8278010-joana", "userReview": "[ or becoming invisible so she could be able to touch him, to caress his face T.T  (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6049062-jen", "userReview": "This book was a definate five stars from me..hands down!! What a wonderful way to begin a series, and this series is gonna be hot!! We are introduced to Diskant Black, who is an \"Omega\" and he can shift into several different animals. He shares his skin with a bear, a wolf, and a wild cat, an very few would want to mess with the protector of the shifter population. He is focused on protecting his fellow shifters, until the day he catches a scent that has him intensly zeroed in on of all things; a human female! He comes across a vampire attacking a female, who he saves and realizes that she is his mate. Ava Brisbane is not only human, but one with a secret ability that few know about. After being attacked by a vampire and waking up to find herself with a huge,sexy shifter male; Ava learns really fast that her life is about to change in a big way. Watching these two go through the whole mating bond dance was so entertaining in more ways then one. The sex in this book is off the charts HOT! Ava and Diskant have so much sexual chemistry, I was seriously fanning myself while I was reading!! Even better, they develop an intense emotional bond and very quickly become each others soul mate. The three stages to the bonding process was necessary to their connection, and when it happened these two very quickly became attached at the hip.Of course every great paranormal series has to have an enemy whom the good guys need to conquer. In Omega Mind we have \"the Shepards\", they are a religous group that feel all shifters are evil and that they go against God's creation. They are fanatical, and they torture shifters of all ages and sex. They are truly horrendous and I quickly was rooting for Diskant and his fellow pack members to get the enemies; and get them good. The additional characters that are introduced in this world are all likeable, sexy, and entertaining. I am so looking forward to future books, and I am especially anxious for Trey's book. The next book deals with Emery and his possible mate Mary; who is a relative of the enemies. This is going to be an awesome book and I am so grateful that it is already out!!This series has just begun, and I can only for see it getting better and better as it develops. Aline Hunter has done a wonderful job of setting the stage for future books. Her characters are ones that are very easy to fall in love with, and the men may be extremely dominant; but they love their mates fiercely and are willing to fight until the bitter end for them. This series is going on my top ten list of faves in the paranormal genre and I look forward to diving back into this exciting world again and again!"}, {"userName": "Anna (Bobs Her Hair)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3167458-anna-bobs-her-hair", "userReview": "C- or weak 3 starsThis is the story of a telepathic human woman named Ava who becomes mated to Diskant, an Omega shifter. The first half of the book is focused on the mating process. (The H/h can't get enough of each other.) The characters didn't seem very sexy or sensual. Instead of intimacy there are dripping loins, wet panties, and uncomfortable buldges in the hero's leather pants. The plots gives hints to something sinister, but the characters must satisfy their lust for each and the plot gets lost. Eventually, the reader learns that shifters are hunted by zealous Christians (more like Christian extremists), named Shephards, who seem to feel shifters are an abominations. There are also vampires in this Aline Hunter series, but I don't feel I learned that much about them. Hunter does introduce something new to the paranormal genre. The Omega in shifter packs can take on any animal form and keeps balance within their structure. Shifters have a painful three-part mating process. Also, Vampires are products of a witch and demon mating. Some are evil and others not. There's also the introduction of mage vampires. This book didn't feel very erotic. The plot was weak until two-third of the way through the story. By the time the pace picked up the book was over. The ending was fulfilling. Issues remained unresolved, which is probably supposed to lure readers to buy the next book. Overall, Omega Mine was about two horny people hunted by bad people. There are glimmers that this series may get better. Two other characters (Emory and Trey - they're brothers) will probably get their own stories. I will wait for reviews before I think about buying the next book."}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5176570-melanie", "userReview": "4.5 starsThis was a fresh addition to the ever-popular paranormal romance genre. Aline Hunter has created a complex world involving shifters, vampires, mages, warlocks (and witches I assume), a secret society of dubious intent, and a religious zealot group hell-bent on eradicating the \"demon-possessed\". In Hunter's world the varying animal-based shifter groups, while each lead by an alpha, are all in fact united by Omega, the ultimate shifter who can channel all of the animals at will. In 'Omega Mine' the black leather wearing, motorbike riding, 6'6\" Omega of New York, Diskant (ok, Hunter could do a bit better with the guys' names), happens upon a vampire attack on a petite human woman, Ava, in a dark Bronx alley. After coming to her rescue, he realizes she's of course his mate. Initially, Ava, who is not just an ordinary human, is reluctant towards Diskant's advances, but after succumbing the two become embroiled in a sexy mating heat of sorts as their bond cements. However, while they're \"bonding\", the shifters of New York come under attack by Shepherds, a religious fanatic group aware of their existence whose goal is to essentially terminate as many shifters as they can... but this time the Shepherds' purpose is even more personal.I found that the tone of this novel changed considerably as the story progressed. At first, you think you're going to read an especially naughty and spicy tale of \"MINE\" between Diskant and Ava as they go at it like rabbits until they're mated for life... and there definitely is some of that (it is from Ellora's Cave after all!). But, this story is \"meatier\" than just that - Hunter does a great job of portraying the conflicts, and emotions of all the characters and overall this is a very well-developed story.In the end, we are left with a cliffhanger with lots of loose ends to tie up, but I'm confident these will be resolved as the series continues. Already, I can't wait to read about what happens with Trey, Emory and Kinsley...

I enjoyed this just as much the second time around and although I have loads of books waiting to be read, I didn't regret having to read it again.It is basically a story of shifters, vampires and mages/witches who are hunted by the Shepherd clan/family who believe that the shifters, vampires etc are literally spawned by the devil so they must be destroyed. In this story we focus on Diskant (the Omega in his pack)and Ava who upon meeting realises she is his mate.

Ellora's Cave can do better. Some of their publications are great. Ellora's Cave (EC) publishes different types of imprints. In terms of heat, the Blush imprint is \"traditional romance, with less emphasis on sex\" while the Romantica imprint is \"erotic romance.\" You would not know it from GR or Amazon info (unless you click the \"LOOK INSIDE\" link), but EC classified Omega Mine as Romantica. Midnight Man, by Lisa Marie Rice, is also published by EC and classified as Romantica, just to give a frame of reference (and mention an erotic author I love).Several of my GR buddies love Omega Mine, so I am in the minority, but it didn't work for me. On the up side, the premise is promising and the characters varied, with shifters, vampires, witches, and magi. Some of the dialogue is fun, too (but I wouldn't call this a witty read filled with sexy banter).Diskant Black is an alpha wolf, but he is also an omega, and in Hunter's world, that means he can shift into any type of animal. I thought that was pretty cool, but it is also confusing, because the terms \"alpha\" and \"omega\" define almost opposing traits in any dictionary. Of course, the author can do whatever she wants, but I reserve the right to feel perplexed by her choice.For example, in Patty Briggs' Alpha and Omega Series -- see Hunting Ground for example -- an omega wolf is not inclined to aggressively jockey for pack position. This frees the omega to bring harmony, comfort, and peace to tortured pack mates.Speaking of tortured, some of Hunter's sentences are exactly that. Tortured. Wonky. Like this one:\"Thinking about the circumstances that brought her to this dangerous location incensed her further and she vented her frustrations via the fingers that adjusted the strap attached to the leather messenger bag draped across her chest.\"*LMAO* say again?!?!!Or this one:\"Pretending it wasn't an issue was like ignoring a rabid, child-eating circus elephant dressed in a pink tutu that was coming right at you.\"*chuckles all around*The promising plot  got lost in the sex. Some of the smexy scenes were >7 pages long (skim, skim, skim). In the midst of great danger, she'd bend over and he'd pull out his tool. \u30c4 To me, the sex felt hardcore, especially at first, because I didn't sense emotional intimacy. For example, during the first sex scene, he didn't even know her name (because he didn't ask). Also, they didn't use protection. She never thought of it until after several mating sessions. (Good thing shifters cannot be diseased, huh?)I did gradually buy into the relationship between Diskant and Eva (he calls her Pinkie) because he was protective and tender when needed. But!! He is too possessive, too bossy, and plus...he's got a goofy name. \u30c4On the down side, my budding relationship with Diskant and Eva weakened every time Hunter shifted the POV to one of several other characters, including Emory, Trey, Mary, Sadie, Craig. Too much head hopping. It felt like Hunter was sacrificing this story to secure my interest in a sequel. \"A bird in the hand...\" comes to mind.Typos. The little buggers jump out at me. Sometimes I feel harassed by the damn things. Hunter needs a new editor, for this book has many typos (commas mainly, but also word errors). Also, Hunter never capitalizes Bible (\"...a bible in one hand and a cross in the other...\") even though it is standard practice when referring to the specific book. With a plot that depicts Christians as evil extremists, you gotta wonder if she has a bias. (Probably just an easy trope.) Mind you, I have seen worse. These varied errors and wonky sentences do not impede the story (much). However, more than a handful of typos (5) is inconsiderate, unprofessional, and annoying.Strong Language Advisory"}, {"userName": "Ingela", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15589375-ingela", "userReview": "3.5 Shifter Stars for a STEAMY story with a lot of suspense and a lovely hot Omega Imagine a muscular, tall man in NY with a Harley, a black leather coat, semi-long black hair, a big predator tattoo and gold-colored eyes.

The character gallery is quite extensive to be this kind of \"hot\" romance. It's interesting and we may superficially get to know many of the plot. I also see several promising prospective follow-up stories (maybe the shifter brothers Trey and Emory's way to get a beloved mate). I acknowledge humbly that I don't really grasped all the intrigue, the origins of them, all different groups' goals and so on in this book. Maybe I'm still a bit of a novice in the paranormal world, or it is simply just my lack of knowledge of the English (paranormal) language that leads to confusion sometimes. But most often I concentrate my interest largely to the development of the love story. And that part is very easy to understand in this book. It steams on and you got it all. Not a single detail escapes you. Sometimes, \"just imagine\" to be even better.Anyway, I had a fun time with the book. Never lost the desire to turn the page and liked (maybe not loved) the various participants in the book.
