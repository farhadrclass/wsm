Ce livre est donc bas\u00e9 sur des faits r\u00e9els plus ou moins romanc\u00e9 puisque l\u00e0, Les larmes noires visent un jeune publique.Quand je commence \u00e0 lire ce petit roman, je suis assez d\u00e9stabilis\u00e9e car l'auteur a un style bien particulier. C'est au fil des pages que je me suis laiss\u00e9e bercer par les protagonistes, dont cette jeune esclave de douze ans, Emma, qui grandi avec Sarah et Frances, les filles du Ma\u00eetre. Mais depuis le d\u00e9part de leur m\u00e8re totalement oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 la traite des esclaves donc en d\u00e9saccord avec son mari, les deux s\u0153urs sont ing\u00e9rables. Sarah est tr\u00e8s, tr\u00e8s proche d'Emma au point de la consid\u00e9rer comme une soeur. Quant \u00e0 Frances, elle r\u00eave de reprendre la plantation de son p\u00e8re plus grande. Le monde s''\u00e9croule quand le p\u00e8re d\u00e9cide de vendre quelques esclaves de sa plantation pour rembourser ses dettes de jeu, et \u00e7a sera bien pire quand il d\u00e9cide \u00e9galement de vendre Emma.Du coup, diff\u00e9rents personnages cl\u00e9s (vendeurs d'esclaves, les esclaves, le ma\u00eetre, les enfants....) interviennent comme une sorte de t\u00e9moignage dans l'histoire.Bien que ce livre soit romanc\u00e9, l'histoire est douloureuse et certains mots choisis sont assez percutants voire affligeants. On se demande pourquoi tout \u00e7a ? De quel droit ?? Pourquoi consid\u00e9rer l'autre, donc ce qui n'est pas blanc pour une sous esp\u00e8ce ; m\u00eame un animal \u00e9tait mieux trait\u00e9 qu'un noir \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque. Les larmes noires a \u00e9t\u00e9 une lecture assez troublante parfois \u00e9prouvante, car ce n'est pas un sujet que l'on aborde souvent dans les livres sur la s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation. Par exemple, au moment de la vente, on pouvait payer au prix fort une famille d'esclaves ou une jeune-fille en tr\u00e8s bonne sant\u00e9, tr\u00e8s fertile, dans le but d'engendrer des futurs esclaves. Chaque esclave \u00e0 son prix et cela part du plus petit prix au plus exorbitant. Le d\u00e9part d'Emma va \u00e9norm\u00e9ment bouleverser Sarah au point de ressentir que de la haine envers son p\u00e8re et ce, jusqu'\u00e0 sa mort.Libre. Mais c'est quoi \u00eatre libre ? Qu'est ce qu'il y a l'autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la rive. Alors, il faut subir pour le moment les humiliations, les coups de fouet etc jusqu'\u00e0 l'Abolition de l'esclavage ; tandis que d'autres pr\u00e9f\u00e8rent ne pas se prendre la t\u00eate. Il est clair que ce n'\u00e9tait pas du tout \u00e9vident d'\u00eatre noir et libre \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque. Pour ma part, c'est une tr\u00e8s bonne lecture avec une \u00e9criture fluide et agr\u00e9able que je recommande \u00e0 tout le monde, surtout \u00e0 la jeunesse.

The points of view are from the slaves, owners, family members and others. The unusual format of dialog shares so well the thoughts, emotions and motivation of each of the characters. It is a captivating story that is written in the language of the day that authenticates its story line. It captures the mood of the time in history well.Review: I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was easy to read because of the dialog format. The banter between characters along with the recorded thoughts of the characters made me feel so connected to the story. I think that older elementary students would get a lot from this book. The story can be looked at for different points. For example one can compare how the different slaves felt about their role in life, some were content with slavery and saw it as the only option, whereas others yearned for freedom. The argument as to whether selling human beings is ethical can also be discussed. I am planning to read other books by Julius Lester, since my interest has been peaked by \"Day of Tears.\""}, {"userName": "Douglas M", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42439237-douglas-m", "userReview": "This book had 177 pages.

Not because it was poorly written, because the writing is fantastic. It was difficult to read because of how angry it made me, and how that emotional level was kept at a fever pitch through the entire book. It was exhausting to read with that kind of internal churning. I kept asking myself how it was possible that we, as a species, can do these sort of things to one another. How we can justify the wholesale subjugation of another ace to the point that it seems a normal part of daily life, and something that is our right to do. That we are doing them a favor by kidnapping and enslaving them. That tearing apart families in the name of profit or expedience is just fine. Looking into that specter of the not all that distant past is horrific and chilling.It was also moving, and inspiring. Not matter how broken as a people a group can be, individuals will always rise in the name of love and of freedom and join together with those who would see all people free,see all people equal. That not matter the hate, the ignorance, and the violence the tyrannical vomit forth, there will be those to stand against that vile tide and refuse to be swept away, to be swept under.As angry as it made me, it also gave me hope. It is well worth the read, not only as a fictional account of a true event, but as an unflinching look into the dual sides of human nature."}, {"userName": "Lesley", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3430178-lesley", "userReview": "takes place at a slave auction!

Day of Tears, by Julius Lester, is a beautifully written story about an incredibly ugly time in American History. The story is written through the perspective of all the characters, mainly Emma the main link between most of the characters. Lester does this in such an effective way that there is no confusion when switching characters, but instead it builds more interest and understanding for the reader. Through switching characters, the reader will learn about the story of many slaves and slave owners during the years of slavery in the South. The reader will see how hard life was hard for both white and black people. The true ugliness of people is shown; but it is balanced with the true love between the two races. The reader will also see the causes and effects of the choices that people make in life.Due to content and language in this book, I would say that this book is appropriate for high school to adult readers. There was language used that felt very offensive. Even when deep within its pages, there were moments of abrupt language.The book will leave your cheeks glistening at the end.

I could not put the book down. This book is based off true historical happenings of the largest slave auction held in the United States.

This story depicts the feeling's Emma's family and other slaves had at this time and also the feelings and thoughts of slave owners at this time.

First this book is nearly all narrative voice. Other than the descriptions of rain as sorrow, and beautifully done I might add, Lester misses an opportunity to contrast the beauty of the southern countryside with the cruelty of slavery. Had he written the setting as another character that contrasted in its free and wild beauty with the situation of the slaves, I think that the setting would have improved the story's suspense and created for the reader a tangible counterpoint of physical depravity between slave's every day life and the South's naturally beautiful landscape. Instead, we the reader receive a series of voices who alternate discussing their experiences of slavery and perspectives on events in the story. The slave auction is based on real accounts of the huge slave auctions held in the major trading posts in the South. They give a reader a real sense of how slavery dehumanized African-Americans turning them into chattel.Julius Lester's descriptions and accounts from Pierce, to Emma, and the slave auctioneer provide priceless insights for readers young and old alike. I also think auction and the rain as tears metaphor was utilized too often over several chapters. At one point, I began feeling like the author was repeating himself without extending the idea of slavery's misery to new exciting actions in the story. As a result, the suspense was reduced, and the reader was deprived a more expansive view of how slavery ripped apart black families in multiple ways, but demeaned the ethical character of white citizens as well. Lester certainly points at Pierce's gambling as a problem of moral failing, but wouldn't the story have been more engaging and convincing if we could glean action events that showed how white families were creating divisions in the family? I would like to have seen the Pierce's two daughters in a big conflict seen over trying to covertly sneak slaves from the family plantation. Now that would be a gripping and intimate scene. Instead, we hear about one family's escape over the Ohio river by a southerner's son who opposes slavery, but the description of the setting is absent, and the action is muted by telling the reader instead of showing through actions the whole experience. I couldn't visualize the slaves escape and feel their experience, but I heard the experience through their voices. Not a bad trade off, but I believe better writing would have made that scene and multiple others in the novel more visceral and moving for the reader. Also, showing through actions instead of telling scenes through multiple narrative voices would tie the reader's affinity for the slave's miserable life situation, added much needed suspense, and allowed the reader to see through the character and author's eyes the enormity of personal loss to all families in the antebellum period of the South."}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5071817-emma", "userReview": "[Told by a screenplay, this book is about the largest slave auction in America's history. The slaves sold came from Master Butler who had lost his money gambling, and owed a large sum of money. He profited over $300,000. Mostly though, this book is about Emma. A slave girl who took care of her master's children after his wife left. His two kids were Sarah and Frances. Sarah was kind hearted like her mother (who left because of the way her husband treated the slaves), and Frances wanted to own the plantation and restore it after it was sold. On the day of the auction, the master had asks Emma to come along with him and the girls because Sarah doesn't want to go to the auction and Emma is the only way she will go. Originally, the master made no plans to separate/sell Emma from her family or his daughters (who loved Emma dearly), but a wealthy woman pays an extremely large amount to the master, and her gives Emma up. Emma's father, who was the slave driver of the master, is fuming with anger when he sees Emma going to Ms. Henfield's carriage (the wealthy woman) because as boys, to two were very close (Emma's father even saved his life once). Sarah does not let Emma go without a fight though, she is kicking and screaming and by the time Emma calms her down she says \"you reminds me so much of your mama. You think you can have a good heart like your mama does? You think you can do that?\"That was the last time Emma saw her dad, and she never said goodbye to her mother. At Ms. Henfield's plantation, Emma works as a caretaker for her daughter, where she marries Joe (who was sold to Ms. Henfield from Master Butler's plantation). On the plantation, they befriend a couple (Charles and Winnie and their baby) Eventually they escape with the couple through a white man who owned a grocery store as well as taught Joe to read. During their escape, Charles' dad (Sampson) catches them (he thinks he outsmarted the white people because he gets fed and clothed and housed) and threatens to turn them in. Charles punches him and they light the house on fire in attempt to kill him (he escapes). The four of them make it to freedom after the baby dies on the boat and Joe and Emma move to Canada, and Emma names her daughter Sarah, after Master Butler's daughter who had a kind heart. Joe dies fighting for freedom in America.The Butlers sold their plantation and moved to Pennsylvania. Sarah says that she never went a day without thinking of Emma. She also never ends up forgiving her father. Up to his deathbed, Master Butler asks if she loves him, but she can't say yes, and leaves the room. Frances runs in, and in between Sarah's departure and Frances' arrival, he dies. Sarah marries a man and names her first born Emma.

The basis for the novel is true, and it is about America's largest slave trade ever. Some of the characters are even real people, though many of the characters are fictionalized. The dialogue is told from the point of view of 22 different characters from slaves and their families, to plantation owners and their families, an abolitionist and even the auctioneer. Part of what makes the book so intriguing is all of the varied and unexpected perspectives that center around a couple of days, as well as some of the unexpected relationships that are portrayed in the book.Although told from many perspectives, the story mostly follows Emma, who is 12 year old when the story begins. Emma is unexpectedly told at the slave auction, even though she has become somewhat of a mother figure to her master's two young daughters. Emma is sold along with another slave she knows, Joe, and they eventually get married. While at a local store, an abolitionist man tells Joe how they can escape slavery on the underground railroad, which they do end up successfully doing. They go on to have their own children, and at the end of the story Emma, as an old woman, is telling her granddaughter about her life for a school project. The torrential rain that happens over the course of the huge slave trade really characterizes the mood of almost everyone involved in the trade. This novel is told somewhat chronologically, but there are \"interludes\" where a character, as an older person, will tell about that event as they remember it now. To me, this made the story that much richer, but also more complex. The reading level of this book is placed at late 4th to early 5th grade. Both the spacing on the page and the relative simplicity at the word level would indicate this to be generally true. However, due to the complexity in the telling of the story from multiple viewpoints and not entirely in order, as well as some of the mature themes, make the book probably more appropriate for the average middle school reader. Some of the potentially sensitive topics include a suicide, slavery in general, death and heartbreak, violence, and the potentially offensive point of view of the master and auctioneer. While there are a lot of potentially controversial topics included, they seem to balance being realistic without being too graphic. I think it would be an excellent book to share with middle school and even high school students. This book could be read with a unit of study of the civil rights movement, black history month, the Civil War, the underground railroad, or even just human rights in general. Some other books that might complement it well include Chains (Anderson), Copper Sun (Draper), or another of Lester's other books such as From Slave Ship to Freedom Road, or To Be a Slave."}, {"userName": "Jaclyn Giordano", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3151525-jaclyn-giordano", "userReview": "Day of Tears is a chapter book intended for students from grades six to nine.

I gave this book five stars. Lester dramatically intertwines internal dialogue of character\u2019s thoughts and feelings alongside actual conversation and dialogue that keeps the action unfolding. Intermittently, the reader gets to read Interludes, which are the thoughts and proclamations of the characters in the future, looking back upon and commenting on how that one fateful day of the slave auction changed their lives forever. The reader gains insights from the slaves and slave owners, children of owners, and even the slave auctioneer. Lester\u2019s portrayal offers so many differing viewpoints and his writing in the form of a dialogue play allows the reader to be inside the action, side by side with characters, as they buy and sell, are sold and gain freedom. This allows the reader to feel what they feel, to see what they see. And, even when seeing the slave auction from varying perspectives, one thing is clear: No one\u2019s life will ever be the same again.

I can not even imagine this time and the amazing fact that despite how most white people were raised there were always those who knew this treatment of blacks was wrong. How that one simple act of kindness or risk could change a person's life forever."}, {"userName": "Alex D", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42439233-alex-d", "userReview": "This book has 171 pages. The main character Is the Master, I can connect to the main character by there bossiness. I can connect to the main character, because I'm bossy too. The reason i gave this book 5 stars Is because I was very interested in slavery. slavery is what is book is about. This book remind me of camps they had back then. I felt really hurt about the ending. The ending left me with nothing to say. (I cried trough the whole book)"}, {"userName": "Alicia", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1806073-alicia", "userReview": "A unique approach to a novel narrating the slave trade in the south, including the biggest auction of slaves, known as the Day of Tears. With dialogue and the occasional \"interlude\" that flashes forward to the characters' death beds and old age looking back is exceptional. The format is fantastic in capturing the magnitude of this event."}, {"userName": "Chelsiekowalski", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2151262-chelsiekowalski", "userReview": "This book,I thought was very interesting im varous ways. I liked it bacause it went back and fourth between slavery times and the time were the slaves bacame free. This book is about sleves that live on the Butler plantation get sold into slavery. It tells their long journey to go to plantation to plantation, i don't want to say any spoilers so thats all i have to say."}, {"userName": "Joe", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1649003-joe", "userReview": "Probably best for a precocious 5th or 6th grader."}], "description": "On March 2 and 3, 1859, the largest auction of slaves in American history took place in Savannah, Georgia. More than 400 slaves were sold. On the first day of the auction, the skies darkened and torrential rain began falling. The rain continued throughout the two days, stopping only when the auction had ended. The simultaneity of the rain storm with the auction led to these two days being called \"the weeping time.\" Master storyteller Julius Lester has taken this footnote of history and created the crowning achievement of his literary career.Julius Lester tells the story of several characters including Emma, a slave owned by Pierce Butler and caretaker of his two daughters, and Pierce, a man with a mounting gambling debt and household to protect. Emma wants to teach his daughters-one who opposes slavery and one who supports it-to have kind hearts. Meanwhile, in a desperate bid to survive, Pierce decides to cash in his \"assets\" and host the largest slave auction in American history. And on that day, the skies open up and weep endlessly on the proceedings below.Using the multiple voices of enslaved Africans and their owners, Julius Lester has taken a little-known, all-true event in American history and transformed it into a heartbreaking and powerfully dramatic epic on slavery, and the struggle to affirm humanity in the midst of it.", "title": "Day of Tears", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/517932.Day_of_Tears", "average": 4.12, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348109847l/517932.jpg", "reviews": 571, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8161.Julius_Lester", "name": "Julius Lester"}], "type": ["Historical", "Young Adult", "Fiction", "Historical", "Cultural"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/517932.Day_of_Tears", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25270877-les-larmes-noires", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/366712.John_Henry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/178462.To_Be_a_Slave", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/907297.When_Dad_Killed_Mom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/878879.Cupid", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/223627.The_Tales_of_Uncle_Remus", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23745439-greensleeves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193601-keeping-you-a-secret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35914878-pretty-dead-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32532886-trusting-you-other-lies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192926-black-flowers-white-lies"]}
