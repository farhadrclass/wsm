I don't really remember the lyrics for A Thousand Years by Christina Perri but reading this book has made it possible. Plus, I strongly believe that the song and the book are really synchronise; knowing that this book is not just about food but also about a long lost love. Imagine having a crush since you were small and you kind of hanging on that crush for quite sometime but eventually your fate is to marry somebody else. So, if that is your story, then you should buy this book. If you're still clinging to old memories and you feel that one day you'll meet your true love, so be it. Let's read the book together, shall we?I don't know about how things can be co-incidental or ironic. This book, regardless the spoilers which I have read before this, has made quite an impact on me. I mean, my mum is not the type of person who cooks great desserts. But I know for sure that this book is a comfort after a car accident that I went through few days ago. My mum was with me in the accident and I'm appreciating her more after these days. I can't even think of a day without her.This afternoon, I watched Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna; a love story which shows that love relates with time. I read this book during the commercial and currently shaking my head for some element of similarities.Okay, let's be objective: this book is supposedly a cliche. Something which has all the normal elements of love stories. But the thing which differentiates good and bad authors are the research on things which they are going to write (in this book, it shows how literature can be romantic and desserts are not really for the diabetic). A dessert book which makes you drool but at the same time teaching you that food brings people together:)I might sound bias but when an author reads before she writes, the book will make you cry. I'm giving 5 stars for the effort and maturity shown in this book and I'm seeking for more of Sarah Strohmeyer's book after this.And guess what? This book is my first book of 2012!"}, {"userName": "Danielle", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/241282-danielle", "userReview": "An entertaining, but somewhat disappointing and disjointed romance/family story.

It's your usual romance with the premise of a strong but middle-aged woman and a handsome but emotionally unavailable man set around a cooking course at the local college.

It's an insightful, and at times heartbreaking account of the struggles that a mid-aged single mother trying to care for her teenage daughter and her elderly parents, all while trying to develop a relationship with the man she's loved since she was a teenager.I liked that this book didn't have a completely fairy tale happy ending. I was surprised by the ending of this book, which doesn't happen very often to me while reading chick lit. I found myself sitting in bed crying as I read the last 25 or so pages. This book felt very real to me, like the characters could be my next-door neighbors. The relationship between Julie and her father could have been explored in much greater detail; that aspect of the storyline was shockingly underdeveloped. I could tell that there was an interesting thought there, but the author failed to explore it. Overall, a great read. A good example of \"heavier\" chick lit."}, {"userName": "Suzanne", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3444927-suzanne", "userReview": "Julie Mueller has known Michael Slayton since she was 10 years old.

I am a Bubbles head & proud of it (yes, I am a yahoo carrying member). I am also going to say, my heart belongs to the Bubbles series & nothing Sarah writes will be as good as Ms. Yablonsky's hilarious series! For real! I mean, hello Bubbles Unbound scooped up the Agatha Award for best first novel in 2001.That said & out of the way, I will say Sarah has whipped up a savory morsel in Sweet Love. This is Sarah's best stand alone to date.Sweet Love is delectable. Sarah Strohmeyer has created a beautifully written novel that dares you to care & get invested in Julie's life. Julie is a single mom doing her best to do the right thing. When I think of Julie, the word mosaic comes to mind.Sweet Love is a heart-rending novel rich w/ emotion. Michael is a brilliant gem. He simply steals the show. Julie's mom, Betty, reminds us just how precious our mom's are. Strohmeyer hits a home run delving into the heart of mother/daughter dynamics. Strohmeyer shimmers as she tenderly & realistically gives us a peek into the lives of Julie & Betty. *Tissues*.Sweet Love is a quick read that packs an ardent wallop. Strohmeyer's writing is so riveting, you can't help but empathize w/ Strohmeyer's delightful cast of characters.Strohmeyer's Sweet Love is as frothy as a chocolate souffl\u00e9. Sheer bliss.Sweet Love is a bit slow to simmer but as soon as Michael appears the book bubbles over w/ yummy goodness.Strohmeyer tosses in a plot twist @ the end that took me by surprise. Kudos to Sarah for penning such a charming novel that invites you into the hearts & souls of the sweetest characters to come along in a long time."}, {"userName": "Aislynn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2121230-aislynn", "userReview": "I started reading Sarah Strohmeyer's books after discovering the Lipstick Chronicles she and several other sassy authors contribute to. In the time I actively read that blog Strohmeyer wrote about this book a lot and I was looking forward to reading it. Finally picked it up last week and I have to say I enjoyed it. The recipes discussed sound incredibly good, but that's just the proverbial icing on the cake. The real heart of the story is Julie's relationship with her mother and her childhood crush Michael. Michael seems too good to be true and their relationship blossomed fairly quickly on the page. But Julie and her mother's relationship seemed incredibly real to me. The only thing that really disappointed me was the lack of exploration in the relationship between Julie and her father. There was so much resentment built up on Julie's side, I really would've liked to see her father's side of things or even for him to have a few more lines - something that would give me the chance to see if their relationship would be salvageable after the story was over.Would I recommend this book? Sure! It's not just a light fluffy read, there's moments that inspire strong emotion, but it also brings a smile to your face or even makes the reader laugh out loud in a few places."}, {"userName": "Margaret", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10549695-margaret", "userReview": "Seventy-five year old Betty Mueller is worried about her daughter.

Big problem, but easily solved; and now Betty regrets, 20 years later, the role she played in solving the problem.Julie went on to marry, a baby already on the way, only to have her husband leave her with a 9 month old infant.

She wants her daughter to be happy. There must be some way to bring them back together.....This was a sweet story, no pun intended. It had laughs and tears and, oh yes, some very tantalizing ideas for desserts! Each character stole my heart except for Julie's dad who remained only a shadow and that frustrated me a bit.

I have to say I'm a Sarah Strohmeyer fan - she's not superfluous or flowery and usually her protagonists are witty, wise, honest and to the point. Although I really liked Julie, I found her to be quite dense when it came to figuring out the intentions of her old childhood crush, Michael. Any guy that goes to Home Depot and buys three air conditioners, hauls them up stairs and installs them so your mother will be able to safely recuperate at home wants more than to get you into bed. Come on lady! Wake up and smell the coffee (and the hot man in bed next to you) - he loves you, too! The food descriptions were mouth watering - made me want to try some. Some are available on Strohmeyer's website. Cold berries with hot white chocolate and almonds - yum!If you are inclined to pick up this lovely book, have a box of tissues handy. You will need them.

I began reading her Bubbles books, and then discovered her others. (I much prefer her other novels that stand on their own, rather than the Bubbles series.)Sweet Love is the story of a woman; a single parent to her teenage daughter, a local newscaster with 20 years of experience, sharing a two-family home with her aging parents. Though she is well-known for her inexperience and lack of skills in the kitchen, her mother gives her the gift of dessert lessons with a famous chef. A gift that changes her life in more ways than she ever could have expected.I enjoyed this book. While it's far from my favorite book by Sarah Strohmeyer, it was entertaining, held my attention, and was a fast and easy read for a weekend day.

That's when you\u2019re enthralled in the tale.The lovely thing about the novel is that each chapter starts with a quote from one of Shakespeare\u2019s play. And the references made! Tintern Abbey, William Congreve, Lady Macbeth, Claudius from Hamlet...But it\u2019s not as if you won\u2019t like the book if you don\u2019t know about the references. The story itself isn't purely romance, but about a woman trying to make her dreams come true, despite her age and history, with a bit of love that comes her way. It made me laugh, cry (not kidding\u2026), got me antsy at wanting two people to come together, and gave me hope that middle-age won\u2019t be dull (even though the ending dialogue was a bit cheesy, it was well-deserved.)

It was through sheer pride that I finished this book, since I didn't want it to be marked 'did-not-finish', and I guess I'm glad I did. The ending was far better than the beginning, but I'm annoyed that it took so long for me to actually care about any of the characters. This was a lovely story about love between women of three generations. If the story was focused solely on that, this would have been a great book. Instead, the main plot centred around a The Notebook-esque drama-filled, absurd, contrived romance. I honestly did not see any chemistry between the two, and it just felt so flat that I was peeved by it more than anything else. Every time Michael was mentioned, I got so irritated.

Although Julie is strong and independent with a quick wit and intelligence, her mounting problems do not make for a quick, light-hearted read.I enjoyed this book for its intense realism, but it was not the book to read during the stressful holiday season.

Like other well-meaning mothers, Julie Mueller believed she did the right thing when she secretly ended her teenage daughter's crush on Michael Slayton, a wild older neighborhood heartthrob with a penchant for Shakespeare and the pedigree of trailer trash.Twenty years later, Betty Mueller has come to realize that was a big mistake. Her daughter Julie - divorced and raising a teenage daughter alone - is a workaholic obsessed with her career. And Michael, the one man who could make her happy, is the one man to whom she won't speak.Now dying and determined to make amends, Betty stages her last great feat of motherhood by reuniting the couple in a dessert class where she hopes the sweetness of a chocolate almond Torta Caprese will erase the bitterness of a wretched misunderstanding.Sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said thy edge should blunter be than appetite, Shakespeare once pleaded though it will require more than poetry and passion fruit for Julie and Michael to renew their love. It will, in fact, require the sweetest sacrifice of all.", "title": "Sweet Love", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2181981.Sweet_Love", "average": 3.51, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1433228597l/2181981.jpg", "reviews": 234, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/26791.Sarah_Strohmeyer", "name": "Sarah Strohmeyer"}], "type": ["Womens Fiction", "Romance", "Fiction", "Adult"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2181981.Sweet_Love", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6529156-sweet-love", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47683.The_Cinderella_Pact", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12924304-smart-girls-get-what-they-want", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/287576.The_Sleeping_Beauty_Proposal", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/583948.Bubbles_Unbound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5456247-the-penny-pinchers-club", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28168785-runaway", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35148447-juliet", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35913695-hidden-secrets", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198274-kiss-me-while-i-sleep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29420557-breath-of-malice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35839275-kian", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23745439-greensleeves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29639736-everything-we-keep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26186801-someone-like-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800300-from-thin-air", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18950617-sweet-caroline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800331-to-hope", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33016164-royally-bad", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34609092-royally-ruined", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193474-the-finishing-touches", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193549-roses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19032297-accidentally-in-love-with-a-god", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29231863-splinter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23622993-claimed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243614-just-jilted", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193601-keeping-you-a-secret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800455-the-pms-club", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800812-gypsy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35708042-bodyguard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800579-willow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30126159-mosaic", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40389026-summer-island", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12369122-because-of-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29373539-the-lullaby-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28441063-secretly-hers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23271170-tycoon-takedown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800411-come-high-water", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33001355-before-i-knew", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205166-the-paradise-of-glass", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32532886-trusting-you-other-lies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21425515-once-haunted-twice-shy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40272947-the-pursuit-of-tamsen-littlejohn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193595-the-story-of-beautiful-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34873257-the-lullaby-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30184217-say-goodbye-for-now", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205144-bridged", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800690-love-is", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26813208-thirty-five-and-a-half-conspiracies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20489452-thirty-one-and-a-half-regrets", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20687181-thirty-two-and-a-half-complications", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198652-twenty-eight-and-a-half-wishes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15836745-twenty-nine-and-a-half-reasons", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36685093-the-unimaginable", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29339972-thirty-six-and-a-half-motives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23263614-thirty-three-and-a-half-shenanigans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40199170-thirty-and-a-half-excuses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24778061-thirty-four-and-a-half-predicaments"]}
