It was just that, a free book. Nothing exciting or thought-provoking. The characters were very one-dimensional. I was bored throughout the book. I'm glad it's now over. I won't remember it later, I'm betting."}, {"userName": "Cherry Soule", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60510796-cherry-soule", "userReview": "FantasticI chose this book to read because I really enjoyed the first in the series. But I must add that I toughly enjoy reading of Scottish and Irish lore! I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys the same."}, {"userName": "Paranormal Romance", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22904875-paranormal-romance", "userReview": "Fleeing from a man who wants to rape her before marriage to ensure a crown, the heroine sees no other escape than to run strength into a war zone. The hero, a Templar knight, leads his severely outmatch and unnumbered men against the Moors but soon the battle turns for the worst and he watches all of his men die. He also spots a female rush onto the killing field and doesn't hesitate to rescue her and take her from the carnage. But in the process, he feels like a coward and also takes a shot to his side and passes out from blood loss. He wakes up on a boat heading towards the holy land with the heroine beside him. He vows to fulfill a vow and bring the art of the convent home to Scotland and together they go on an adventure to first find the artifact then transport it back to Scotland. I felt disappoint by this book and compare it to a very dull version of Indiana jones. First off, the hero was half dead just at the start of the book via the arrow he was shot with, yet arrives in perfect health in Jerusalem and it's never spoken of again. I'm sorry, just because the guys a beast on the battlefield doesn't mean he's invincible. That sort of injury doesn't just instantly heal itself. Another thing was the comical way the villain would just pop up randomly in a scene. They're in the middle of the jungle and he'll appear like magic and threaten the heroine. They would escape and have a moments reprieve before he'd reappear again. It was like wack-a mole! I also found it extremely unbelievable that it would be that easy to find the lost ark and certainly it's unbelievable that one guy and a small 100 pound woman would be able to carry out the thing when it's solid gold. I didn't find any rhythm to the story and was bored very quickly with the lack of imagination with the dialogue. I would have loved to be taken deeper into the male hero and explored his guilt over leaving his men but this book was not deep or thought-provoking in the least."}, {"userName": "Brian Bigelow", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7273607-brian-bigelow", "userReview": "I just started reading it based on a friends suggestion. I'll admit that I was almost put off thinking it was only a romance, there are romance elements in the book though. I'm rather pleasantly surprised as there is a lot of action and adventure in this book that is set in the 14th century. I want the one that she was betrothed to against her will to die painfully and slowly. He so richly deserves it, he's so revolting, crude and abusive that he can really be called a bastard. I've never hated a character as much as I hate him. It's really that great a story and I can't put it down is why I'm giving it 5 stars. I'm so wrapped up in it, I just can't wait to see what happens next. Gerri has really written a great book, it will appeal to just about anyone I personally feel."}, {"userName": "Jodi Ashland", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8069966-jodi-ashland", "userReview": "Kindle Free, SEDUCING THE KNIGHT by Gerri Russell. Loved the forbidden passion, vulnerabilities, and the author's interpretation of the arc of the covenant. I read the 2nd book first, and although it stands on its own, I wanted a little more history and scenery. Then I read the 1st book in the series TO TEMPT A KNIGHT and got the history and scenery I was looking for. I recommend reading them in order."}, {"userName": "Sheri Salatin", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1957523-sheri-salatin", "userReview": "It started out really interesting and I even thought for a moment that it was a Christian book since it was a quest for the Ark of the Covenant. However, it wasn't and there were just too many parts that I couldn't agree with Spiritually, physically and emotionally to give it a high rating.The writing was well done."}, {"userName": "S.E.

It was deeper than your average romance. A lot research must have gone into this. The quest for the 'Ark of the Covenant' added to the intrigue and brought out the true nature of the main characters.
