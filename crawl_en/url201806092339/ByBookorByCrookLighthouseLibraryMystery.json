One thought the job should have been hers, others didn\u2019t think the position was necessary, and even the head of the library board wants to get rid of her. The head librarian and the staff at the library are thrilled to have her join them, especially with the Jane Austen exhibit and programs starting.An event took place for friends of the library to see the exhibit before it was opened to the public. Just as Bertie, the head librarian, is ready to announce a special addition to the exhibit the head of the board is found dead. Because of his position to get rid of Lucy, she becomes a suspect but Bertie is the one that leaps to the top of the police\u2019s list. Then one of the Austen novels goes missing.Did Bertie remove the book to throw suspicion away from herself? Or is the real killer a thief too? Or are there 2 criminals on Bodie Island? Lucy hopes to close the book on the case by answering all those questions.First, the author starts the book saying there would not be enough space in a real lighthouse to include all the books, staircases and rooms she has written into this book, so on the basis of the library\u2019s structure the reader must suspend reality and I was fine with that. I just imagined a huge lighthouse, bigger than I have ever seen. Think of it \u2013 each level has a special purpose. The main floor for the usual adult fiction and non-fiction with a special alcove and program areas. The next floor is filled with children\u2019s books and programs. The third level for rare books, maps, etc. And the fourth floor a unique living space where Lucy has made herself at home. There is also a working lamp at the top. What a glorious setting with wonderful views! I would love to suspend the reality far enough to take me there.Ms. Gates introduces us to fine characters. The library staff is made up of Bertie, Lucy, Ronald, the children\u2019s librarian, Charlene, research librarian, and Charles, the library cat in residence. Lucy\u2019s aunt, uncle, and cousin, along with the mayor, a nice detective and a not so nice detective round out what I assume will be the regular supporting cast. We also meet some unique friends of the library. Some were easy to like, others took some warming up and others were written to be not very likable. The author did a great job with this cast.The murder mystery was not easy to solve. There was an entire room of suspects with an opportunity to commit the crime. The missing book mystery was also difficult because it could have been anyone from library regulars to someone off a bus that brought tourists in for the Austen exhibit. The library really should have had some kind of security person watching over the priceless items, but I don\u2019t think there ever imagined the number of people that would pass through their doors for this event. I had a certain library patron at the top of my list but it was just a feeling. As the proof was all revealed I was surprised I actually was right.I enjoyed everything about this story. Thee characters were very engaging, the mystery was very well written, and the setting was to die for.I am late to the party on this series, but I am going to get all caught up before the fourth installment, The Spook in the Stacks, comes out on June 12."}, {"userName": "\u2742 Jennifer ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1340220-jennifer", "userReview": "The story gets 4 stars but the editing barely deserves 1 star.

The idea of a library housed in an old lighthouse appealed to me. The setting is charming and perfect for a cozy mystery. Our amateur sleuth is Lucy Richardson. She recently fled Boston after her boyfriend wanted to take their relationship to the next step and she didn\u2019t want to. In fact, he really didn\u2019t want to either. Their wealthy parents were the ones who really wanted the marriage and Lucy had no intention of giving in. She heads to Bodie Island on the Outer Banks of North Carolina where she gets a job as a librarian. Her first assignment is setting up an exhibit to showcase a set of Jane Austen first edition novels.Lucy is stunned to find that so many people in town despise her. In fact, one person who made his feelings publicly known is the head of the library board. He states quite loudly for all to hear that he intends to get rid of her. So, when he is found murdered in the library, all fingers point to Lucy and her boss. When the Jane Austen books are stolen \u2013 one by one \u2013 everyone is all too ready to put the blame on Lucy and run her right out of town. She has no intention of sitting quietly by and letting that happen.It took me a little time to warm up to the characters in this book. Most of the supporting characters weren\u2019t very likeable, but I did like Lucy and the people she worked with at the library. Although her boss, Bertie, took me some time to like. Did I mention the library has a cat named Charles (named after Charles Dickens, of course.)I have to admit, I knew who the killer was rather early in the book. It didn\u2019t ruin anything for me as there were several different possibilities so I could really have bought any of them being the culprit. I\u2019m already reading the second book in the series.FTC Disclosure: The publisher provided me with a copy of this book to review. This did not influence my thoughts and opinions in any way.

There were no absolutely perfect characters in this book. However, by the end of this book the author seems to setting up a love triangle. I sincerely hope she doesn't go through with it. Love triangle seem to muddle up mysteries.The mystery was good, plenty of suspects and clues, and the ending left me pleasantly surprised.

I love lighthouses. When I came across this first book in the Lighthouse Library cozy series, my eyes lit up, and when I discovered that \"Eva Gates\" is the pen name of one of my favorite authors, Vicky Delany, that was the icing on the cake. North Carolina's Outer Banks seems to be one of the hot settings for cozies, and By Book or by Crook fits right in with its neighbors.I liked Lucy Richardson, even though she didn't win any points by staying in a relationship for ten years just to keep her parents off her back. Grow a spine, girl, because I have a feeling that those parents of yours won't be able to leave you alone in your new home! Lucy is surrounded by an excellent cast of secondary characters who are a good mix of supportive and irritating. Fellow librarian Charlene's passion for rap music is a running joke throughout the book, and it's a joke I enjoyed since I personally didn't have to listen to the music. I did find it a tad worrying that Lucy has two prospective beaus. She may not be ready for them yet, but I've learned to treat romantic triangles with a great deal of suspicion, thanks to Janet Evanovich. Lucy's fellow librarians are just the sort of people you'd want to work with, and here's hoping that Louise Jane never ever gets a permanent job in the lighthouse library. Louise Jane is the sort of person you'd just love to slap, and I figure the main reason why she so desperately wants to work in the library is that no one wants her there. (As you can see, this is a wonderful cast of characters because I seem to have gotten emotionally involved with them!)Another perk of the book is that you really get a feel for what libraries have to deal with in this age of constant budget cuts. The author makes it clear that keeping libraries alive depends on the librarians, the patrons, and members of the library board and city government who all realize how vital these places are to communities.The mystery in By Book or by Crook provides both the high and the low points of the book. The high point? The killer is hiding in the best place of all-- right out in plain sight, and I cannot believe I didn't figure out the person's identity. The low point? I had a very difficult time suspending my disbelief when it came to the lack of security in place at the library for the exhibit of priceless first editions of all of Jane Austen's novels as well as one of Austen's notebooks. I could easily go on in more depth about this, but I don't want to slip and give away too much of the story.Lack of security aside, I really enjoyed this book. The author took the rather unfeasible idea of putting a library in a lighthouse and made it work with wonderful descriptive passages, an excellent cast, and an intriguing mystery. I'm looking forward to heading back to the Outer Banks for the next book in the series!"}, {"userName": "Lesa", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1366422-lesa", "userReview": "There's libraries. And, then there are charming libraries. And, they don't get much more quaint and charming than the Lighthouse Library on Bodie Island, North Carolina in Eva Gates' By Book or by Crook. This first in a new series will either make you want to move there to get a job in the library, or run, knowing the library is the scene of murder, theft, and possibly, ghosts.Lucy Richardson fled to the island after she didn't want to marry the lawyer and family friend she'd been dating for years. Luckily, she is able to leave her job at Harvard Library, and become Assistant Librarian at the Lighthouse Library. She's so excited to be part of the reception where the library board and staff introduces the special exhibit of rare Jane Austen first editions. She isn't so excited when the library board president is murdered during the reception, and Lucy's new boss, Bertie, becomes the primary suspect because she had a loud argument with the victim, and was found with the body. And, it gets even worse when one of the Jane Austen books disappears. It seems not everyone likes Bertie, or the library itself.Eva Gates excels at setting this new series in a delightful small town setting and enchanting library. She introduces a wonderful cast including quirky characters and two possible love interests for Lucy. And, of course, there's a perceptive library cat, Charles (named after Dickens). Lucy herself seems a little naive and young for her thirty years, but considering her background as the only daughter in a wealthy Boston family, it may not be surprising. I'm sure she'll come into her own in the course of the series, and won't let the rival for her job continue to scare her with ghost stories.If you're looking for an enchanting getaway, a mystery to help you escape the winter doldrums, you can't go wrong with this first in a new series, By Book or by Crook. Cats, Jane Austen, books, and a lighthouse library.

Its fine to set a mystery at a popular summer resort area, to appeal to beach readers. But then to completely ignore the setting you've chosen is ridiculous. The author's note admits that the lighthouse could not house the library, except in her imagination. So why not create an imaginary lighthouse? Why refer to stone walls when describing the brick Hatteras lighthouse? The setting, characters, and plot were extremely improbable. It feels like the author had a story written, her editor or agent suggested she write a seashore mystery, and add a little Jane Austen twist to appeal the rabid Austenites, and she wrestled this story into the requested bounds. Very disappointing, and I won't be reading any more of Eva Gates's work."}, {"userName": "FangirlNation", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48546466-fangirlnation", "userReview": "In By Book or By Crook by Eva Gates, Lucy realizes she needs a new start on life after refusing the proposal of her longtime boyfriend.

I enjoyed the book while reading it, but didn't really have the urge to pick it up again and I never fully felt engaged to the plot or story. There's nothing obviously wrong with this book, but nothing that really stood out either. I really like the original concept and setting. The library in a lighthouse was such a fun concept and I liked reading about this cozy lighthouse library. The setting in the Outer Banks region so close to the sea was also great. Then there is Charles the cat who is adorable and has his quirks and cat behaviour that made me smile. And he looks so pretty on the cover! I also liked reading a bit about how the ran the library.Then there was the mystery fell a bit flat for me. The main character doesn't really get much involved, she does a bit of her own research, but it was mostly awkwardly talking with people. She mostly focusses on her work in the library and while I enjoyed that part I had hoped for a bit more focus on the mystery. I didn't predict the murderer, but then again there were almost no hints to that. I usually prefer there are some clues or that at least looking back it makes sense, here there was none of that and even with the explanation of the murderer it didn't make much sense to me. The main character did figure it out, but more by accident and she didn't really have proof, except for that it made sense and then the murderer came after her. It was just a bit meh.Next to the murder mystery there's also the mystery of books that go missing. And it's unsure whether it's connected or not to the murder. There's a lot of focus in the book about the Jane Austen exhibit they are doing and I just couldn't relate as much to everyone's enthusiasm about those first editions. I haven't read any of Jane Austen her books and never felt the urge to, so it felt like I missed a part there and I think that part of the book would've been more fun if you are a fan of Jane Austen her books.The character were okay. At first I had a lot of trouble keeping them apart, the book starts literally at a party and the main character is meeting new people and I can honesty say I might have been even more overwhelmed than the main character herself. I am not good with names ad having a lot of them dumped at once didn't help. After that it did get better and I at least got a feel for who was who. I would've liked a bit more depth concerning the side characters. We did got a reasonable feel for the main character and her life, but the side characters stayed a bit flat. And ugh I seriously disliked Louise Jane, I am not sure what it was about that character but she rubbed me wrong so badly. To summarize: This was a fun cozy mystery, but I couldn't fully get into the book. I did enjoy it while I was reading it, but didn't really care or feel the urge to pick it up again once I put the book down. The lighthouse library made for a fun concept and the Outer Banks area was a great setting. I also loved the cat the Charles, who was my favourite character. I liked reading about the library, but didn't really get all the excitement about the Jane Austen books as I haven't read nay of her books myself. The mystery fell a bit flat, with little involvement from the main character, little hints to who the murderer was and the reasoning behind it was unsatisfactory to me. I had some trouble keeping the characters apart at first, but that got easier after a while. The side characters lacked some depth, I liked the main character well enough and disliked Louise Jane.

It was the perfect cozy. How can you not love a library that is INSIDE of a lighthouse and the main character also lives in the lighthouse in an apartment above the library? I don't read a lot of cozies that have cats in them, but I actually loved this cat Charles. That is because the author treats it like a CAT, not a cat that acts like a human, not a cat that is psychic, not a cat that tries to solve the mystery. I highly applaud the author in this respect. I was surprised by the culprit. The person was not at the top of my list of suspects. There are enough characters that you just love to hate to put on that suspects list. Of course we all have to one at least one nemesis in these cozies and there was no shortage of characters you love to hate. The only thing I may be a bit wary about is the potential for a love triangle for the main character. I am hoping there won't be but I can see how it could head in that direction. The only issues I had with this book was with the narrator. She had a raspy, scratchy voice that took a while to get used to. She had wonderful character emotion and voice acting but I constantly felt the need to clear my throat because of her raspiness. I was not impressed with her southern accent. Also, she tended to pronounce the same word differently. One that came to mind was Cadillac Escalade. Most of us know how this is pronounced but at one juncture, instead of pronouncing it as Es-ka-laid (to rhyme with everglade), it was pronounced Es-ka-lahd (to rhyme with Lady Marmalade). Just tiny things like this turned me off to the narrator. I am planning to read book #2 in the series and will probably go with the audio again. The narrator wasn't bad enough for me to resort to avoid the audio and stick with the ebook.

She goes to the Outer Banks of the Carolinas to take a job at the Bodie Lighthouse which is also a libray. Her Aunt and Uncle who live in Nag's Head, welcome her with open arms. Lucy gets to live in a small apartment on the fourth level while working at the lighthouse library. Murder, treasured first editions by Jane Austin, and the greed to have power are part of this enticing story. There are people that are dislikable and some that are charming. For people who love mysteries about books and libraries with a library cat part of the scene, how can you miss? I will be looking forward to the second book in this series, BOOKED FOR TROUBLE, coming in September, 2015.b"}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7998730-becky", "userReview": "I enjoyed this book but the beginning was slow and take awhile for me to get into.

It's a light, fun mystery that is mostly character driven- there isn't a lot of active sleuthing in it and to be honest, I felt like the murderer was pretty obvious from the get go. But really, I didn't care. I didn't even really care when the author made mistakes regarding Austen (confusing her publication dates with the dates and order in which the novels were written and citing Austen and Charlotte Bront\u00eb as contemporaries, among other things). I think what I took most exception to (which surprised me) was the implausibility of an insurance company insuring an exhibit with so little security in place to protect the collection. But even that I managed to dismiss because frankly, this book is just fun. It features a likeable cast of characters that I found engaging and easy to invest myself in. I loved the setting and I thoroughly enjoyed the ghost stories about the lighthouse. The additional literary nods to Charles Dickens and Wilkie Collins were also appreciated and fun. I'm really looking forward to diving into the next book just because I want to see where these characters end up!"}], "description": "Get bound up in murder in the first Lighthouse Library mystery! For ten years Lucy has enjoyed her job poring over rare tomes of literature for the Harvard Library, but she has not enjoyed the demands of her family\u2019s social whorl or her sort-of-engagement to the staid son of her father\u2019s law partner. But when her ten-year relationship implodes, Lucy realizes that the plot of her life is in need of a serious rewrite. Calling on her aunt Ellen, Lucy hopes that a little fun in the Outer Banks sun\u2014and some confections from her cousin Josie\u2019s bakery\u2014will help clear her head. But her retreat quickly turns into an unexpected opportunity when Aunt Ellen gets her involved in the lighthouse library tucked away on Bodie Island. Lucy is thrilled to land a librarian job in her favorite place in the world. But when a priceless first edition Jane Austen novel is stolen and the chair of the library board is murdered, Lucy suddenly finds herself ensnared in a real-life mystery\u2014and she\u2019s not so sure there\u2019s going to be a happy ending....", "title": "By Book or By Crook\n      \n          (Lighthouse Library Mystery #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22927960-by-book-or-by-crook", "average": 3.7, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1409170310l/22927960.jpg", "reviews": 405, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8365921.Eva_Gates", "name": "Eva Gates"}], "type": ["Mystery", "Mystery", "Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22927960-by-book-or-by-crook", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22668724-by-book-or-by-crook", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28563651-by-book-or-by-crook", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24452987-booked-for-trouble", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25894011-reading-up-a-storm", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36276514-the-spook-in-the-stacks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37581710-the-company-of-demons", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40024832-empire-of-sin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8343548-the-bricklayer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193155-among-the-wicked", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23818400-the-snow-garden", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29420557-breath-of-malice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29639736-everything-we-keep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23157833-almost-dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33555347-crime-scene", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30249521-fatal-frost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266676-remains-of-innocence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34330657-finding-claire-fletcher", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28824403-outfoxed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23957469-huntress-moon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204087-the-deepest-secret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35115882-what-the-dead-know", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40267317-ragdoll", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35914878-pretty-dead-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39791173-the-girl-before", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205081-last-witness", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205040-dead-weight", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18903409-weekend-warriors", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34873257-the-lullaby-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193809-eye-for-an-eye", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27239265-the-short-drop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205144-bridged", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17623604-you-only-live-twice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17377392-thunderball", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17284593-casino-royale", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17623578-for-your-eyes-only", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193858-the-cuckoo-s-calling", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17304110-live-and-let-die", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18780375-dr-no", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192926-black-flowers-white-lies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17379070-moonraker", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18799804-diamonds-are-forever", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205231-the-spy-who-loved-me", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17377384-from-russia-with-love", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243961-the-cape-refuge-collection"]}
