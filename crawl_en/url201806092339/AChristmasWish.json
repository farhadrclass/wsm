I enjoyed taking this journey with our main character, Flora. She makes the rash decision on Christmas Eve to road trip to the village where she was abandoned as a newborn to try to discover who her birth mother is. This isn't just romantic comedy (though there is some of that!) it is also a tale of a thirty year old woman trying to come to terms with who she is, where she's from, and why she was abandoned - a theme that has plagued her since she was a child. I enjoyed this funny cast of characters, and the warmth that was shown to an outsider. I never would have guessed who Flora's mother was in the end, a mystery I certainly didn't solve!3.5 starsThank you to Erin Green, Aria and Netgalley for a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Dash fan ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61989809-dash-fan", "userReview": "4\u2606 A story of self discoveryA Christmas Wish is a charming story about self discovery and finding out who you really Are, when you just don't belong.When Flora Is dumped as a tiny baby on a doorstep then adopted into a loving family.

Feeling unloved and unwanted like everything happened to her by default \u2014 she lost her job with a pile of unopened posts and bills, got dumped by her boyfriend and worse was, her mother abandoned her at a doorstep one Friday morning on the 10th of October, 1986.She never got a sense of normality ever since she knew about it or a peace of mind for thirty years. There's one question she wanted an answer: \u201cWho is my birth mom?\u201d. Wanting to know the truth and finding the missing jigsaw puzzle of her life, she went to St. Bede's Mews, Pooley on a Christmas Eve in search for the answers of her who's and why's. After a fateful night in jail, she reunited with an overly excited newspaper boy and met the money-grubber cheating crackpot, the bitter gourd gold digger and the bloody gossip queen sisters. Will Flora finally be able to be a whole person or she'll end up being as broken as she was before?Erin Green was able to equate feelings of longing with the suspense of revealing the truth to her readers. She made sure that the story is not far from a snowy winter eve, twinkling lights and love under the mistletoe.Assumptions, gossips and secrets.Everyone in the village of Pooley have their own memories to share like they are walking down on memory lane. They helped Flora in every way they can and it gave me a sense of belongingness like I was her, craving for the truth.Each characters have their own secrets to tell from Dr. Fowler, Veronica, Annie and Mick to Scott and Joel, I couldn't helped myself rooting for all of them. They made an essential appearances in the story that formed an array of tangled web. The story was engaging and the author has the succinct talent of making her readers felt like they were inside the world of Flora or one of the village people of Pooley, just watching and waiting for the next gossip.Joel's frustrations and a broken heart on the other hand gave a positive energy that formed an unspoken friendship and love for Flora. She may or may not be able to know the truth about her birth mom but more the less Joel fills that missing piece of her heart that will never ever be done by anyone or anything.A Christmas Wish is not your average meet-cute romance read. It's actually a jam-packed mystery novel about love and friendship where you get misleading clues yet will consistently surprise you because the ending is a clean sweep of utterly shock and wonder.\n\n\u201cIn real life things aren\u2019t said, lies aren\u2019t uncovered and families don\u2019t address the issues they should. Instead they ignore the sensitive subjects, swallow the lies and look past the secrets, promising to deal with them one day.\u201d\n\n***Thank you Yasemin Turan of Aria Fiction for including me on this blog tour, to Netgalley and Erin Green for providing me an ARC in exchange for a fair and honest review!\n\nLinks to buy:Amazon | Kobo | iBooks | Google PlayAbout the Author:\nErin Green\n was born and raised in Warwickshire, where she resides with her husband.

I was hit by a tiny reading slump this week and that's why I am late reviewing this, but I'm so glad I read it because it got me out of my slump. This is my first book by this author and I see myself reading her books in the future.Flora is our heroine, she, like it says in the blurb was abandoned on a doorstep. The story starts on a Christmas Eve night where Flora abandons her Christmas party on a whim and is on a path to go find answers, find her birth mother. Lately, she was feeling abandoned because her boyfriend cheated on her and she didn't feel like doing the whole thing celebrating the Christmas Eve drunk in a pub with strangers and all. So she heads to the small village called Pooley. And her first encounter in the town with people is not so comfortable as she almost goes to jail for accidentally assaulting a police officer. And she discovers she is already popular around in this part of the town. It was all fun to read. Joel is our hero. He is the police officer Flora accidentally \"assaults\". He too just went through a breakup recently. He seems to be so curious about Flora. I liked Annie and Mike who ran the pub and also own the inn where Flora is staying at. Annie was my favourite character. She helps Flora solve her mystery. We get a lot of POVs so that was great to see everyone's perspective as everyone has some sort of secret.Ms. Green created a nice world. It was amazing to read about a village full of people being so close. Everyone has their own secrets and it was mesmerising to see them all unfold. I wanted all the gossip and making me sit on the edge of my seat at times. I liked the ending too. I liked reading about the England version of a small town, I hadn't read any book set in a small village of England before. I felt like I was in the village and part of their community so the writing was exquisite. It was a great mystery romance novel. I wholeheartedly enjoyed it.*An ebook copy was provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.*"}, {"userName": "Gaele", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9146116-gaele", "userReview": "Told in alternating first person points of view from several characters: this is the story of Flora Phillips and her need to find out just who she is, and why she was left on a doorstep as a newborn. At the start, Flora is a bit of a pity-me girl \u2013 and doesn\u2019t engender much empathy as she has blamed all of her failings on her history. Can\u2019t keep a job? She was abandoned as an infant. Can\u2019t find a man? Abandoned \u2013 why would anyone want her? It was a struggle for me to not want to slap her and turn her to look forward rather than excusing her own lack of motivation and drive because of her history. And then, things started to turn for her (and me). An impulsive decision to head to the doorstep on which she was found, and hopefully discover more about her own parentage turns into life changing moments for her and the people of the town. From an inglorious head butt to a policeman who will later become a love interest, to the wonderful pub owner Annie offering her support, comfort and friendship: the long buried secret of the \u201cBaby Bede\u201d causes tumult, turmoil and several upsets. The concept behind this story is glorious, and Green shows a facility with description, characterization and drama that is evident, if occasionally bordering on too much information to process. But, nearer the end of the story, it becomes clear that this is Flora\u2019s path through the questions she\u2019s had, the people she encounters and the secrets and suspicions they have: liberally peppered with insets from the townsfolk and their own memories of 1986. With relationships starting, ending and experiencing tumult, Flora\u2019s search is at the center of it all: from the sublime to the messy. With the little village where everyone knows your name, your history and even your family, she is an anomaly: all knew of her, none knew how she came to be. If you are willing to surrender to the story as it unfolds, building a picture of the town and the people, you will search along with Flora: finding clues and information, seeing her grow and revert to old habits, and watch as her relationship with the town and Joel grows, and answers come to light. A wonderful debut that puts Erin Green on my authors to watch list. I received an eArc copy of the title from the publisher via NetGalley for purpose of honest review.

Although the story begins on Christmas Eve, it is a human story rather than a holiday story. Flora Phillips returns to the small village of St. Bede's Mews, Pooley, England, a place that has no memory for her but was her beginning. Flora was abandoned on the doorstep of the local physician on an early October morning thirty years earlier. She has returned to her origin not because she has issues with her adoptive parents but because she has questions about her origin and her birth mother. Known locally as Baby Bede, her abandonment was the biggest story to hit this small town and is still an unsolved mystery.As she looks at the doorstep on which she was found, local police officers Joel Kennedy and Scott Hamilton view her as a Christmas Eve reveler who has probably had too much to drink. Joel draws the short straw and goes out on the snowy evening to see to the odd acting lady. Unfortunately their meeting includes an accidental bumping of heads which sends him to the hospital with a broken nose and her to a holding cell.By the time she is released it has become well known that she is Baby Bede as news travels fast in such a small town. Having only the red evening dress and a pair of strappy evening shoes, Flora seeks refuge in a small inn close to where she had been abandoned. She is taken in by inn owners Annie and Mick O'Neill, a childless couple. Nurtured by Annie, Flora begins an earnest search to find her parentage.A delightful tale told using many voices, this book is a different tale showing the pain and yearning incurred in such an occurrence. The town rallies round Flora, as do her parents and best friends form Bushey, several hours away. The wealthiest man in town funds DNA testing, and the villagers participate. All the while, Flora and Joel, both recovering from dramatic break ups, cautiously find their way towards one another.A lovely story for all seasons with rich characters, splendid winter settings, and a mystery with a very unexpected outcome. I do wholeheartedly recommend this book and very much look forward to Ms. Green's next novel."}, {"userName": "Marsha Spohn", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27349116-marsha-spohn", "userReview": "Reviewed at Keeper BookshelfA Christmas Wish isn\u2019t your typical holiday romance, while it begins on Christmas Eve it certainly doesn\u2019t stop there.Flora had been abandoned as a tiny baby. She makes the journey back to the village where she was found, and presumably her parents lived, to do some self-discovery. If she could have one Christmas wish come true it would be to find her blood relatives, to know why she was left behind with no one in the world, and how a mother could simply abandon her baby. Flora was adopted by a loving couple who made her their daughter in every sense except birth \u2013 but she is driven to know her past and now is as good a time as any to begin that search.Flora has been a loner, by choice, so when she sets out to solve the mystery of her birth parents she will discover so many people would be willing to call her friend\u2026 or more. Perhaps she didn\u2019t make the best first impression, but she simply needs some truth.A Christmas Wish is a delightful story of one woman\u2019s journey to find herself, or the person she might have been if she\u2019d not been left on a doorstep practically naked. She will discover a mystery, new friends and a place that accepts her as she is in a way that no other spot has done. Perhaps she will find more than the truth about her past, but more importantly the love that will make up her future.I would recommend this story for any time of year for it\u2019s less about the holiday celebrations and more about one woman\u2019s mysterious birth. If you love mysteries, holiday romance and simply a very good story then you\u2019d enjoy A Christmas Wish.*I received an e-ARC of this novel from the publisher via NetGalley.

Flora, adopted as a baby, is determined to find out who her birth mother is and perhaps why she left Flora on a doorstep of the town doctor and his wife one winter morning. Thus, leaving a holiday celebration for no real reason other than her thought about who her birth mother is, Flora returns to Pooley, the village where she was found on the door step. Standing and staring at the door step of this house where she was found, Flora is stopped by the local police, who want to know what she is doing there. During their discussion, Flora drops a paper, and she and one of the cops, Joel, both bend to pick it up at the same time. They butt heads, and Joel ends up with two black eyes and a broken nose. His partner Scott immediately arrests Flora for assaulting an officer, though Flora and Joel try to protest that what happened was merely and accident. Joel is off to the hospital to have his nose looked at, while Scott takes Flora to the local station to book her. There, as the locals question Flora, they realize she is the once-famous abandoned baby from thirty years ago. Unfortunately, the mystery of who she is and where she came from were never solved, and life moved on. However, the town has never forgotten. After having charges dropped, Flora stays on at the local pub and inn, the Peacock, owned by the loving Annie and her husband Mick. Thence, Flora continues her search for her mother, wondering each time she sees a woman about the right age if this woman is the one who left her on the door step that day. Everyone in the small town remembers the incident and has a basic opinion, but no one seems to know many details. Still, Flora stays on, hoping to discover who her mother is and what exactly happened. At the same time, Flora and Joel begin a relationship, fraught with events, emotions and memories that may just prevent it from becoming a real thing, while Flora continues her search.This is a pretty good story. I did find it difficult to see the relationship between Joel and Flora, as, for a large part of the book, there was nothing between them except a basic friendship, though could see something hiding in the background and there was a basic chemistry. However, Joel had just left a relationship with and older woman, who later decided she probably should not have broken off with him and was thus trying desperately to rekindle what was once between them. Flora also has a history of bad relationships, and her current ex, like Joel\u2019s, also wants to get back together. Neither of these makes things easier for the two. I think a lot of time in the book was spent going into background, with little of this adding much to the story, which made the story drag on and on\u2014while there was no deepening of the Flora-Joel relationship. A missed opportunity. In addition, the author used a lot of British slang, which I was not familiar with, throughout, which only made it more difficult to plough through. I think the book would have been more enjoyable with less \u201cBritishisms\u201d. Not sure who the author intended as an audience, but, if it included American readers, she ought to keep that in mind for future books. Like other reviewers, I also skipped large parts of the book, as I found I could not bear to go through another chapter with little or no bearing on the ending, which I eagerly anticipated. This is a good story with a pretty good plot. I am just not sure of the execution.

She believes it is because she was abandoned as an infant. She believes her entire life would have been better if she only knew who she was.Although she was adopted by parents who love her very much, she still sees her life as being \u201cless\u201d than what it could have been.On a whim, she drives to Pooley the village where she was found. It is Christmas Eve and in her party dress and high heels, she kneels at the locked gate to the church. Flora has been observed by two policemen who believe she must be drunk. Her car is parked in a no parking zone, she is behaving strangely and it is their duty to find out if she is in distress.Pooley becomes her safe haven. In the village she is the Bede Baby. In the village, everyone knows of her but no one actually knows her. And in the village, she is welcomed with curiosity but also with open arms.Annie and Mike run the pub and Flora is offered a room and food and friendship. Joel and Scott are the two policemen who found her. She accidentally head butts Joel and from that action Scott distrusts her. He believes it was an assault, he arrests her. Joel is fascinated by this young woman and in spite of his injury, he is curious about why she has come and what she wants.Annie helps Flora create some plans to get people involved in helping her solve the mystery. Among other things there are interviews with people who may have memories of that morning when the naked baby wrapped in a towel was found on a door step. One of the results of Flora's presence in the village is a closer look at personal histories. Relationships and reputations come under the microscope of memory. People who have been aware of the abandoned baby now look more closely at lives as they were in 1986 and how things have changed since then. They start looking at the village and themselves as an outsider would see everything and everyone.Ms Green creates a Flora who sees the world through her own personal mirror. She is almost oblivious to anyone's feelings other than her own. Her parents and her two best friends have shared her life and she yet sees them as though they are minor planets in her universe. It takes her a very long time to come to grips with the way her actions are altering the lives of villagers, her parents and her friends. She could be a poster child for being someone who is self involved. Eventually the world around her and the people who populate that world seem to appear on her radar.The villagers are a varied group of people with varied perspectives. Generally the generosity of spirit and the kindness is almost overwhelming. That generosity of character shown to Flora is what finally helps her find her way in the world. Flora is definitely the main character, but Joel and Annie are two people who are important to the action. Both of them are very invested in village life and both of them have painful histories which have influenced their view of the world. Both of them are wonderful characters.In fact, nearly every character in the book is a complete human being. Some of them are more likable than others, but all of them are interesting and it is easy to understand their motivation.The plot is a good one, and as facts slowly emerge from the mist of the past, the reader is drawn into the guessing game. Ms Green has created a really good book.I received this book from the publisher through NetGalley.

I did my usual greedy \"snap 'em up sweep\" and was looking for a slew of Christmassy reads. The only thing that speaks to Christmas in this book is the date it all starts - Christmas Eve. It isn't really even a back drop to the action so that disappointment may have coloured my judgement of this book. I did feel that it was mis-named and slightly misleading; but if I'd read the blurb I may have picked up on that.Still, quashed that feeling of mild delusion and ploughed on. Started off so well with the differing viewpoints of Joel and Flora and what exactly happened during that fateful clash on St Bedes Mews. The novel then proceeds to tell everything from the point of view of a different character as indicated by the section heading. Sadly, none of them have a distinct \"voice\" so I found myself having to frequently flip back to find out who was telling me this section. I have no issue whatsoever with first person story telling and seeing everything from one character's perspective - in fact this often makes the book for me because I become invested in that particular person. Unfortunately, because every one of them sounded the same I couldn't get particularly interested in any of them.Love the story theme - an abandoned baby coming back 30 years later to find out who her mother was, less important to her seemingly is the father. What I didn't like was what a wet lettuce Flora is. Yes, I am sure it was a shock to find out the circumstances of your birth when you were the tender age of 7 but she seems to be stuck at that age and an immature, tantrum throwing 7 year old she must have been. Everything ill that has ever happened to her she blames on the fateful event in 1986 and blatantly ignores the good things and completely refuses to take control of her life.Not quite sure where heartwarming or uplifting come into this story, they are as missing as the Christmas. The \"romance\" between Joel and Flora is just \"icky\" and so forced that they feel like two disparate characters just settling for the best they think they can get - which isn't really best for either of them. I did manage to read on to the end but wasn't really that fussed about who her mother was I just wanted to finish it so I could get on to something more warming and fun.Simply put, this one really wasn't for me."}, {"userName": "Mick Arnold", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42820427-mick-arnold", "userReview": "A Christmas Wish by Erin GreenFor those that know me, you know that you won\u2019t hear too much about the actual story from my reviews. If you want those, then there are plenty of other reviewers and other sites that will tell you all you need to know about the story. No, I believe in telling you my thoughts on the style of the writing etc.I have made it a habit, a joy of life to follow debut authors from the Romantic Novelists Association and it was with great joy that I came across this young lady\u2019s\u2019 first release. Getting published is a very difficult thing to accomplish, believe me, I know, however when you come across a story of this quality you know that all the hard effort that the author has put in is worth it as we, the reader, get to enjoy the fruits of her labour.Briefly, this is a \u2018Christmas\u2019 story with a difference as despite the title, the story actually begins on Christmas Eve as our protagonist, Flora, is drawn back to the town in which she was abandoned as a new-born and the story is of her quest to find her mother. Aided by local copper, Joel, she finds more than she\u2019d bargained for, and ultimately, the price she pays emotionally for the truth is more than made up for by what she gains from her spur-of-the-moment decision to leave a party to make the journey into the unknown.For a debut author, I am very impressed by the skilful way this author weaves a tale of multiple characters, all with interlocking stories and motives that you swiftly get used to. It\u2019s an unusual way of telling a story, though by no means less enjoyable for it and I\u2019d be happy if I had half the skill to tell a tale so well. We switch from Flora, to Joel, to ex\u2019s, landladies, doctors and well, you name it, we get it.I\u2019m very pleased to report that each character is well written, you can feel the love the author brings to each of her creations and this is a very, very accomplished first outing. I shall leave you with one final thought \u2013 keep an eye out for this author because after you have finished reading \u2018A Christmas Wish\u2019, the first thought that will go through your mind is when will her next book be out?"}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41853321-jen", "userReview": "Imagine knowing since you were seven years old that you were special, different. Not the usual kind of special that every kind parents tells their children they are, but a \u2018you were left on a doorstop as a baby\u2019 kind of special. Wouldn\u2019t you want to seek out answers? Wouldn\u2019t you want to see where is was you were abandoned and perhaps to trace the parents that you never knew? This is exactly the decision that Flora comes to in A Christmas Wish, a decision which sees her on a journey that there will be no turning away from, and one which will change her life forever.From the very beginning you get a really good picture of Flora. Having abandoned her friends at a club in Christmas eve, she sets off up the country in search of her past. From this very action you can see she is a determined young woman, and the more we get to know her, you get to see her head-strong and stubborn streak, as well as her kind nature and apprehension over what she is going to find. And she really does go on an emotional journey, torn between her love for her adoptive parents and her need to discover the truth about herself and her birth mother. Perhaps it is her age, or the fact that she is coming off the back of a failed relationship with no ties and no family to call her own, but whatever the reason, now it seems is the perfect time to head to Pooley to try to find the truth.Now it doesn\u2019t take long for the humorous side of the book to show itself. An accidental altercation with a Police Officer on her very first night sees Flora very nearly spend Christmas day in custody. And it is this gentle humour and the subsequent development of the friendship between Flora and Joel, which comes to inform the tone of the whole story. You can see that there is an immediate chemistry between the two, which isn\u2019t just the painkillers Joel is taking following his first introduction to Flora. It really is a beautiful thing to watch blossom, beset with misunderstandings and plagued by those who would see to sabotage their relationship before it even begins.There are some wonderfully diverse characters in the book, everyone from Landlady Annie, who becomes like a surrogate mother to Flora while she stays in Pooley, to the more eccentric characters such as Darren, the boy who discovered young Flora all those years before. Each one captures a certain element of village life, bringing a sense of authenticity to the story itself, especially the setting. And then there is Veronica. Joel\u2019s ex. Well she\u2019s certainly a character. I\u2019ll say no more about her \u2013 perhaps best you read for yourself. There are so many people who have reason to keep secrets, that it really could be any of a number of residents who know the truth and yet no one seems to come forward. With many a clue being left for Flora in her comments book, how much of it she can rely on remains to be seen.The story is told from the points of view of many characters, so I did have to concentrate a little as to who it was we were following in which chapter. It is easy enough to do, with the voices unique enough to tell apart and the narrative making it clear who was who. It is the first time I\u2019ve come across quite so many voices being used, as we have not only Flora and Joel, but Annie, Flora\u2019s adoptive mother, Janet, the Dr whose doorstep Flora was left on, Veronica and a mystery narrator all adding their voices to the mix, it is quite a lot to keep track of. If you don\u2019t like multi-narrator stories, then this may well see you crack. It didn\u2019t spoil my enjoyment of the story, but took a little getting used to.Overall, this is a very heart-warming and uplifting read, just perfect for Christmas."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2464996-anne", "userReview": "I\u2019ll admit I started this one expecting something rather more Christmassy \u2013 although the story does open on Christmas Eve \u2013 but instead (and maybe I should have read the blurb more carefully) found it instead to be a wintery read with plenty about it to warm your heart. The structure is very different, with a range of characters picking up the story of Flora\u2019s search for her birth parents from their perspective \u2013 and once I got into the zone, I liked that, especially the unidentified one who kept throwing in the red herrings, although I did sometimes need to double-check who it was that had picked up the story.Flora is thirty, but does seem younger, and her self-centredness did get up my nose a little \u2013 but there were plenty of other characters I really liked, particularly the lovely Joel, mother-figure Annie, the lovely florist and the horrendous (but more complex than she at first appears) Veronica. The story\u2019s a fascinating one, and I was intrigued to see how it turned out \u2013 there were really nice touches of humour, some well done sparky dialogue, and plenty of drama. And do you know, I\u2019m always a bit of a sucker for a vividly drawn village setting and the community that lives there."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth Ray", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11564097-elizabeth-ray", "userReview": "I received this book as part of a book tour and am voluntarily reviewing it. This was a sweet story with a great plot. Flora was abandoned on a doorstep as a baby and one Christmas Eve, she decides to flee her life and try to figure out where she came from. Some of the townspeople support her search and try to help, while others are angry with her for digging up the past. One person who helps her is police officer Joel, who Flora has an unlucky encounter with her first day in town that lands her in jail. As Flora searches, she begins to question her future and what she wants to do with her life. Each chapter changes viewpoints and by the end of the book, I would say the reader has been in about 10 different people\u2019s heads. It wasn\u2019t confusing, though. There was one chapter at the end of the book that I think should\u2019ve been left off, as it took away from the reality of the story, but it\u2019s an extremely minor complaint. I love how this book had an element of mystery to it as I tried to figure out, along with Flora, who her mother could be. It also had romance, small-town drama, family relationships, and friendships. This book was well-written and moved at a good pace, even though Flora didn\u2019t have many clues to her origins.

Ms. Green\u2019s description of the sleepy little village of St. Bede's Mews, Pooley drew me in.I could imagine Flora as she searched for clues to answer the questions she has been seeking all her life. Flora not only finds the answers to her questions, but along the way, finds a new love, makes new friends and finally finds a place where she can settle and create a family.I enjoyed this story but at times was frustrated by it. Not only was there was romance, but there was drama, suspense, humor and sadness. I believe that this is the first book from Erin Green and although it is a good debut, I did feel that it was a tad drawn out, but then that is just my opinion.

I liked this method of telling the tale, I felt it moved the story along quite smoothly and not too fast.I thought the storyline was unique, I enjoyed the banter between the police officers, there were some laugh out loud lines, it was intriguing seeing how Flora's presence was having a strong effect on the villagers, as memories from the past are dragged up.An entertaining, romantic read that had me quickly turning the pages desperate to know if Flora's Christmas Wish does come true!"}, {"userName": "Sammie  Wilkes", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17491308-sammie-wilkes", "userReview": "4/5\u2b50\ufe0fWhat a great book ! it starts off on Christmas Eve - Flora returns to Bede Mews where she was abandoned 30 years ago as a baby ... there was never a story to who her parents were or what happened to them - so Flora has come to find out herself and hopefully end the years of questions she cannot shake - accidentally she bumps heads with Joel - a local Police officer - breaking his nose , landing her in a cell and a whole bunch of emotions running around for Christmas Day. Not the greatest starts to Christmas on a quest to find out your roots ! The story develops ... over the course of Christmas - new year ending with Christmas Eve the following year ... perfectly wrapped up ! Well.....I enjoyed the story of Floras Christmas quest to find out why she was abandoned on a little Mews Doorstep ... I loved Joel and how their love story blossomed ...

There are a lot of different people narrating, which can be a little jarring in the early part of the book, but you get used to it. Most of the narratives are either Flora or Joel, and the story centers around the two of them (Flora's search for her mother being the main plot, and Joel trying to get rid of his clutchy ex being the subplot). Flora is a good heroine - she's just enough of a lost soul that she's easy to sympathize with, but she has grit and integrity. Joel is a great hero, totally supportive of Flora. Their relationship begins as friends and develops slowly and naturally through time. This book will appeal to readers of chick lit and romance. Tear warning, the last two sections are all of the feels. My only advice is don't get too caught up trying to solve the mystery of who her mum is, because there aren't a lot of clues provided, and that's not really what the book is about. The who is less important than the journey Flora goes on to find out.

Who left Baby Bede on the doctors doorstep that foggy night in Pooley. 30 years of wondering who her real parents are brings Flora back to the scene, longing, wishing for answers. Told in first person perspective from each of the main characters, we're thrown possible suspects, village tales from the past, characters back stories and we explore the village, which is based on a real location. This book keeps you guessing until the end. It's well written, intriguing, although possibly lacks some progression of relationships. It's more of a who done it comedy than a rom com. Refreshing to me as the last few books I've read that were romcoms have been thoroughly transparent from the outset. Still enjoyable but transparent. The fact that it's loosely set in my home town is a bonus. I never knew that until I'd read so many similarities that I went searching on Erins page for information. I'll look forward to reading Erins other books."}, {"userName": "Tracey", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12009708-tracey", "userReview": "3.5 starsYou really feel for Flora, after all everyone needs a sense of identity. So when a rash decision one Christmas Eve leads to Flora coming back to the place she was abandoned, you want her to find some answers too.As the cover and title are so festive I was kind of expecting a bit more Christmas, however the Christmas link is tenuous and I wanted a bit more of Flora experiencing Christmas in a village full of strangers. Instead it moves on from this emotive period pretty quick. That said what you do have is a well written story with well rounded characters.Alongside Flora's search for her mother is a lovely blossoming romance. It doesn't detract from the importance of Flora's search but adds more depth to the plot which I really enjoyed.
