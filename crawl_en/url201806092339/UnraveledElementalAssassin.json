I read the 14th book some time ago and was a bit reluctant to read this, since it is a rare author who can keep a series fresh after all this time. Turned out, having this break between books was a good thing. Getting back to the World of Gin Blanco felt like a Holiday! It is a book that doesn't hurt your soul or depress you by its realistic depiction of the daily grind. It is so over the top at times, that you can stay on the sidelines rooting for your favorite characters without taking on the baggage of their experiences or emotions. It is full of sass and action, bloody duels and search for hidden jewels, even cheese one liners and carols. And it all happens around the Christmas Holidays. It is humorous and unassuming, heavily relaying on us readers retaining the history of the characters and machinations in this Elemental Asheville. This time Fin, Gin and the gang are going on vacation at a Western themed park in Georgia. You guys remember how their last vacation went, right? Exactly! It was a disaster! As always, Gin almost got killed. This time around, their vacation is not less exciting. They get to enact real life Western shootouts, freeze and burn things, and generally make a mess out of the resort. It is fun and games, if you like your games to come with an actual threat to your life, for everyone! Good Old West recreation and cheer. The books in this series are a bit formulaic, a bit cheesy, and a whole lot of fun! Redundancy be darned, this series feels like a hug from a friend exactly when you need one, and I am eternally grateful for that! It is tiring to read one \"serious\" book after another. Something has to remind us that life is here to be enjoyed, not only suffered or deeply analyzed! I recommend this series to all who enjoy UF and like to spend several hours entertained. A vacation from reality, what more can you want?:-)I wish you all Happy Reading and may you always find joy in the pages of a good book!!!"}, {"userName": "Jo", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14323468-jo", "userReview": "23/11/2016 Buddy reading the bloodthirsty Gin with the amazing Wednesday UF group over at BB&B. I can\u2019t believe how much I have missed my time in this wonderful world of Gin and her friends.  \n\nIt was the perfect night to kill someone. \n\n It\u2019s mere weeks after the revelations that came to light in Bitter Bite, and Gin is trying to get answers about the elusive group the Circle, who claims they\u2019ve been running Ashland\u2019s underworld all these years, and that they were the ones who ordered Mab to kill Gin and Bria\u2019s mother and sister. Unfortunately for Gin it seems the Circle is very good at keeping their identities secret, and Gin together with her sister and friends are finding no clues to help them in their search.  So when Finn receives a surprised inheritance from his monstrous dead mother, an Old Western theme park and fancy hotel resort the Bullet Point, Finn convinces Gin, Bria and Owen to take a mini vacation for a few days. But as we\u2019ve come to learn in this series, vacation and Gin never go hand in hand, and danger and secrets ensue, together with a hunt for hidden treasure.  Gin was as awesome as always, even though she only started kicking ass near the end. Her loyalty to her friends and sister continues to be one of my favorite things about her, and once again she risked life and limb to protect those she cares about.  I always enjoy it when we visit areas out of Ashland, and the hotel resort and theme park definitely added a very entertaining setting for this book. The intrigue regarding the Circle continues to build, and although we do get some insight into them, they still remain a mystery, and I just can\u2019t figure out who their leader might be. I do think it must be someone we know, or have seen in this series though. Also Hugh Tucker is proving to be an excellent villain, and Gin will definitely need all her skills and power to defeat this vampire.  Gin is also struggling with the knowledge that her mother, Eira Snow, was part of this evil group when she was alive. It was sad seeing how much she struggled with this, having the image she had of her mother broken, but in the end it makes me just think she is more like her mother than she thinks she is. As the story progresses we learn more about Eira, especially with Gin\u2019s flashbacks to when she was little, and it definitely makes you see there is a lot more to Eira\u2019s involvement than Gin knows. We also find out something about her father, Tristan, who died in a car accident long ago, and it makes me wonder why we haven\u2019t learned more about him.  I love the violent action in this series, how casual Gin is about her bloodthirsty assassin ways ;-) and the many humorous moments in-between. Gin\u2019s happiness with her wanted poster was hilarious :-D The secondary characters, together with Gin, is what makes me love this series so much. Finn is still struggling with his guilt and feelings of betrayal and hurt after what happened in the previous book, but there were moments that we got to see the cocky and charming Finn I fell in love with. Silvio continue to be a favorite of mine, and I just love the sarcastic banter between him and Gin. He really is the most perfect assistant for a dangerous assassin. I missed Sophia and Jo-Jo in this book, but luckily Phillip and Lorelei also played some minor roles.  Gin and Owen\u2019s relationship seems to have reached its stability, and their loyalty and belief in each other is wonderful. There weren\u2019t a lot of romantic times though, which I really missed.  It\u2019s amazing how much I\u2019ve come to love this series, despite my earlier issues with OTT repetitions, which just shows you how awesome the story and characters are. Starting this book made me crave to re-read it again ;-D And now we have to wait until April next year for the next book\u2026 :-( This is definitely one of my favorite UF series\u2019 and the bloodthirsty Gin and her fantastic friends are excellent."}, {"userName": "Robin (Bridge Four)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14105531-robin-bridge-four", "userReview": "It is book 15 so you know if you like this series or notRead with my UF group at Buddies Books & BaublesSometimes I feel silly reviewing books for a series when they run this long because why would you read a review for book 15 in a series that you should read in order. This book should be named Gin and the Cowboy Theme Park as the gang takes off to go on a vacation since the last one went so well to a cowboy themed hotel and park that Fin\u2019s no good momma left him. But Gin is bound and determined to help Fin with his Mommy issues and HEY it should be fun and relaxing right\u2026..But since this is Gin\u2019s vacation of course there will be a treasure hunt for some missing gems and one or five people that are out to kill her.Highlights from the story are Silvio. I love that assistant vamp and his way of taking care of Gin even when she is trying desperately not to be taken care of. I really like the relationship and growing friendship between them. He is like the new father figure in her life since Fletcher is dead. There is also a cowboy dwarf that is cantankerous and snarky I adored as well and maybe\u2026just maybe if we play our cards right he might one day meet our favorite Goth dwarf and sparks could fly. *crosses fingers* Gin\u2019s version of damsel in distress was hilarious. Gin doesn\u2019t do damsel in distress and so when someone tries to take her hostage during a Wild West show\u2026well let\u2019s just say dude picked the wrong person for audience participation.Lowlights there is still some repetition happening but not even close to what we used to have to go through. Still Gin and Owen take a freaking test and dispense with the condom usage. I don\u2019t need to hear about little white pills and condoms anymore.I both like that Fletcher was all omnipotent and leaves little clues for Gin and Fin and don\u2019t like it. I mean if he had a little air elemental magic going on I might by that over a year past his death certain clues or files appear that Fletcher left for Gin to find at just the right moment. It keeps him present in the story but at the same time I have to stretch to buy into it. Overall this was one of the more enjoyable Elemental Assassin stories and I like the new info on \u2018The Circle\u2019 still\u2026how many more of these books are we planning on. We are now at #15 and I really could do with some big showdown with the circle and a wrap up."}, {"userName": "Carmel (Rabid Reads)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4561998-carmel-rabid-reads", "userReview": "Reviewed by: Rabid Reads.It\u2019s been 9 books since Gin Blanco\u2019s last vacation, and we all know how THAT turned out! I loved the old West theme behind UNRAVELED, the continuation of Deirdre\u2019s plot line from the previous installment, and how Fletcher Lane\u2019s legacy still lives on. Even though I couldn\u2019t resist the lure of an advanced review copy, I\u2019ll probably purchase the audio because Lauren Fortgang\u2019s twang + cowboys = a match made in heaven.Jennifer Estep has attempted to end this series on several occasions, and yet fans keep demanding more, so once again she\u2019s put to the test by having to craft a villain that makes Mab Monroe, Salina Dubois, Harley Grimes, and M. M. Monroe look like kittens. Add to that the challenge of creating an antagonist with long-term nemesis potential, and a deep rooted history of animosity with the heroine. Presenting\u2026 The Circle!As the name suggests, the Spider has a group of new foes to contend with, and in this novel readers get their first real taste of Hugh Tucker. He spent most of his time in the shadows pulling Brody & Roxy\u2019s strings, but it made for a disguise-wearing, gun-slinging, theme-park-showdown of a good time. There was a treasure hunt for Sweet Sally Sue\u2019s jewels, a safety deposit box mystery to solve, and Gin got her face on her very own wanted poster.This title also branched out a bit from the standard ELEMENTAL ASSASSIN cast; Blanco, Owen, Bria, & Finn were the main characters, however Silvio, Phillip, & Lorelei made the trip to Bullet Pointe as well as backup which was a nice change of pace from the usual secondaries. They picked up another ally along the way too in the form of Ira, the ex resort manager turned disgruntled employee whom I thoroughly enjoyed.UNRAVELED was another notch in Jennifer Estep\u2019s belt of writing excellence! ~ 4.5 Stars"}, {"userName": "Steven", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11855472-steven", "userReview": "Following the events of Bitter Bite, Finn inherits an old wild-west theme park and hotel. Gin, Owen, Finn, and Bria take a weekend trip to check out the place and see what they can scrounge up about the Circle. Little do they know, a little rootin' tootin' sharp-shootin' action is headed their way, because though they're headed there looking for the Circle, they might find more than they bargained for...When I started to get into this one, I was a little wary of the whole Wild West amusement park theme. I mean, you've got this serious assassin storyline, and they're spending the weekend in a park full of saloon girls and cowboys and outlaws... I just pictured a ridiculous Dollywood backdrop for our intrepid assassin.Boy was I wrong about it being cheesy! I mean, the park was a little cheesy, but the storyline picked up nicely.

I have to give JE props however because the usual Gin mess ups that carry the story didn't happen. However, it's still pretty formulaic. While I don't need romance if the author introduces, I figure then use it. Instead what we get in every book is one romantic event almost thrown in because the author is forced to. Otherwise Gin spreads most of her time alone. And it's weird.Two grown people who claim to totally love each other with no kids hardly ever spend any time together on the pages of the story. Gin is always alone at home at night. Owen has an adult sister. He doesn't have to babysit her. Why aren't he and Gin co-habitating by now? Or why does she always spend her nights alone. It's just weird as if the author doesn't have a reference for relationships.Anyway, I think I know who the head guy is and why he's not shown on the picture. (If you've read, you'll understand my ref). If I'm right, it's too obvious.I'm going to give this series one more book. I need something more. Something different. Not the Gun runs in, her plan is foiled. She or her family are kidnapped. And then they await rescue. It's like every book. Switch it up. IDK how? But something. And why can't Owen rescue Gin for once instead of the other way around. Why can't he be more apart of the story instead of in the shadows.

Nothing makes my day like knowing I\u2019m about to immerse myself in the world building and characters of Jennifer Estep\u2019s imaginings. AND, of course, I was not disappointed.Unraveled follows almost immediately after the events of Bitter Bite. Gin is keep a close eye on her foster brother Finn, especially following the aftermath of his mother\u2019s betrayal. She is also keeping both eyes out for clues on the mysterious \u201cCircle\u201d. The same circle that has ties to Finn\u2019s and Gin\u2019s mother.Finn receives an unexpected inheritance that includes a Dolly Worldish type theme park. Knowing it is probably a trap but still wanted to learn more about the circle, Gin, Finn and their significants head down to the park to check it out.Circle assassins are lying in wait and its up to Ginn and her posse to wrangle up the bad guys.All the key factors are there to make this an amazing read. Magic, mayhem and a group of fascinating friends and family are there to back up Gin and her incredible ability to think her way out of insurmountable odds. There is some romance but it takes the back seat to the amazing tale Estep has woven for us to enjoy. In other words, Estep whipped up a deliciously delightful adventure. 15 novels and quite a few novelettes and this series is still going strong.I received this copy of Unraveled from Gallery, Threshold, Pocket Books in exchange for a honest review.

This story follows hard on the heels of the previous full length book Bitter Bite with perhaps a slight nod too to events at the end of Unwanted. Yet again the paranormal aspects help flesh it out but it's the human interest, the emotion as secrets come to light that dominated the story for this reader.Having been so used to Gin tangling with all manner of adversaries at home it was interesting to see how she tackled her new location. From the start it's obvious to our favourite spider that there's a reason they are being led to Bullet Pointe but hey ho nothing ventured nothing gained . Now don't underestimate her though as Gin might willingly step into someone else's web of lies but she's got a few tricks of her own . What started out as a vacation becomes a manhunt and I bet you can guess just who is in the crosshairs . Still her enemies might lay a few traps but compared to Gin, pfft, absolute rank amateurs! I read this very quickly which is a shame really as I do look forward to these books. It's clearly a pivotal piece as its laying the ground for the next direction in which the series is going with new villains at work. This is difficult to review as although I loved the wild west atmosphere with its humourous notes I felt a tad let down by the action . There is a well thought out scene with Gin stepping up and taking on the bad guys but perhaps it seemed a little too easy? I've read books where she has almost become an enfant terrible, embarrassing lesser magic users and proving yet again that she is unstoppable . Plus are her enemies really that stupid ? Fool me once, fool me twice but three times! I get that we see what we expect at times but really with a vampire around I did find something perhaps a wee bit implausible. So only really one good scene that showcased Gin's wicked talents but a whole lot more about her past was revealed here . Entertaining , well written but alas not my favourite in the series but trust me I will be back for more because you just know with Gin and her happy band there's going to be an awful lot of payback ! My final note is I was asked about this series recently and whether or not it's romantic? Well there is romance but it's on the back burner, a comforting glow perhaps as this author gives us urban fantasy that is unique and compelling I was gifted a copy of this from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review"}, {"userName": "Karla", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3024056-karla", "userReview": "4.5 Stars! God help me the day this series comes to an end, I\u2019ll have to find a withdrawal program.

This was another action packed, kickass installment in this ever evolving series! I\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again, when this group of friends and family work collectively to oust the enemy, it makes the story even better. Gin alone is magic, the group at her back makes it epic!Watch out\u2026 Silvio\u2019s in the house\u2026my goodness what a fantastic addition he\u2019s been to this series and I am thrilled that he is getting a novella of his own, Nice Guys Bite, coming December 12th. Mystery surrounds him and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve even begun to see what he is fully capable of. He just slid himself onto a stool in the Pork Pit, self-appointed himself as Gin\u2019s assistant, messes with Finn, which is comical and in general has been a huge boon to the character line-up.While the overall plot in the series moves forward and remains intriguing, the author misses the mark a little with Gin and Owen\u2019s relationship. If you\u2019re going to bring a romance element into the story at least allow it to move forward. I\u2019m not asking for a lot, but I feel like these two are at a standstill. For two people who have declared their love for each other, they spend very little time together. However, when they are in each other\u2019s company the chemistry is undeniable, but I need something more to let me know that they are working toward a forever together!Fifteen books in, along with a few novellas, and the author continues to breathe life into the series with mysteries from the past. With the information offered up in Unraveled about the Ashland underworld, it begs to wonder what really did happen all those years ago when Gin and Bria\u2019s mother and sister were killed. And how does Fletcher fit into the picture? He\u2019s been long gone but always has a heavy influence in the plot.

With this book being book fifteen in the series, you\u2019re definitely better if you read the books in order, especially since the events in this book explore the consequences of the discovery in the last book BITTER BITE.I\u2019m a big fan of Gin Blanco. I think she\u2019s changed a lot over the years but even being the queen of the underworld doesn\u2019t mean that she is all-powerful. At least not yet because there\u2019s something called \u201cthe Circle\u201d that not even Gin knows about. This book really centers around them and it\u2019s a bit of a mystery mixed with action/suspense with this book as Gin, Finnegan and the crew try to find out what\u2019s really going on with \u201cthe Circle.\u201dAs I mentioned before, I\u2019m a big fan of the series, but I feel like things are a little slower in this book. I didn\u2019t find it as action-packed as some of the previous books have been but I also understand why. Because Gin doesn\u2019t exactly know what\u2019s going on, she won\u2019t act until she is sure. So until we discover what these Circle members really are, everyone is treading lightly.Estep\u2019s books are always well-written and extremely plotted and UNRAVELED is no exception. I feel like this book has a never-ending amount of stories that Estep can tell because even with fifteen books in the series, the stories are all fresh and so different from one another.

Unraveled is good fun, Jennifer Estep fills her pages with brash almost cartoonish heroes and villains. They are larger than life and occasionally over the top....but they're always good fun. It's not perfect, she gets some technical details wrong (e.g. when the last shot of an automatic pistol is fired, the breech locks open, and yet we get the \"click, click, click\" you expect in a 1950s matinee) but in some ways, those little foibles make her books better.

In my awesome wisdom I was already sounding the death knoll for this series (I should know better) and now we have a whole new slew of bad guys to kill and since Gin is my \"revenge junkie's\" hero I have to say I am delighted.While we have what seems to be a bit of a carry over from the end of Bitter Bite our heroic characters decide to take a vacation (since the last one worked out so well) and it goes about as good as the last one.Somebody is always trying to kill Gin but she pretty much always comes out on top even if somewhat bruised and battered in the process (usually a near death experience) but this time we had a bit of a mystery thrown in but even as dim-witted as I am I knew where the jewels were hidden right away (nope, you gotta figure it out on your own).The fact that this one takes place in an old west amusement park does add a bit of flavor to it but the real beauty of this book is the slow reveal of the redirection of the series and it looks to be fun.Bottom Line: Totally enjoyable, if you loved any of the books in this series, you are going to like this one. The overarching story line looks to be picking up some interesting twists and I can't wait. 4 Stars and highly recommended for all of us \"revenge junkies\" out there."}, {"userName": "Chris  Carroll", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16768971-chris-carroll", "userReview": "What I love about Jennifer Estep is that she is passionate about her characters and it clearly shows in her writing.The fact that the author has the ability to tell a story that is full of action, adventure, and even some love on the side, yet keeps the reader completely involved, is the mark of a great writer. The story, while number 15 in the series, is just as exciting as the prior books that I have enjoyed. Sometimes when you read a series that is long the author may lose focus, concentration, and the connection with the reader. This is not something that happens in a Jennifer Estep book.Always delightful and thoroughly engrossing, Unraveled is a perfect addition to the series. It amazes me how the author can continue to come up with interesting events and stories for the main characters. It\u2019s never a stretch of the imagination because you\u2019re completely involved in the book and look forward to each new release with anticipation.A fun and exciting read with plenty of action! You have to check out this great read. While it can be read as a stand alone, do yourself a favor and pick up a few books that were released prior so you get the full effect of the series.full review - http://amidlifewife.com/unraveled-jen..."}, {"userName": "All Things Urban Fantasy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2732683-all-things-urban-fantasy", "userReview": "Reviewed by All Things Urban FantasyIt's always refreshing when Gin and company get the chance to go outside of Ashland and get into trouble somewhere else. In UNRAVELED, Gin has a very bloody vacation adventure in a Wild West theme park. The park is so cheesy and I loved it! Gin and company end up in a shootout over a prize Finn's mom has hidden with the park as a backdrop for the action. As expected Gin, with a little help from her friends, defeats the bad guys. The really fun aspect of this fight was the way in which Gin basically goes \"Home Alone\" on the park and creates tons of deliciously deadly traps.Each bad guy seems to \"out evil\" the previous one in this series and I was concerned about just how much more evil we could get out of a person and not be bored by the same notes being hit in the plot. Luckily the answer for the next level evilness that Gin must defeat comes in the form of The Circle-a secret group that controls the Ashland underworld. in UNRAVELED we get to 'unravel' more hints about this group and how it relates to Gin's past. I am really interested in finding more out about this Circle and just what they've been responsible for in the past and present.We get to have some more secondary characters helping out this time which was a nice way to shake things up and add some freshness to the storyline. I love how Gin and her friends have evolved over the series and while we are at book fifteen in this series some repetitiveness is kind of expected, I am thrilled to see where this new Circle arc goes."}, {"userName": "Maria Dimitrova", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15922517-maria-dimitrova", "userReview": "Buddy read with the Wednesday UF group over at BB&B.I came so close to DNFing this one. The start was sooooooooo boring. I just couldn't reconnect with the characters. It was a struggle. But because I'm a mule-headed masochist I persevered and eventually got to the good part. There is a good part. It's just that it's the last 20-30% of the book. Then Gin finally stopped reacting and began kicking ass, Spider style. And it was so cool! I loved all the blood and death she dished out! I even got excited for the next book. Yey! Still I was generous with my rating and this was more of a 3 star read.

The Circle is one of the biggest adversaries to date, with fingers in seemingly every pie in Ashland. As if that weren't bad enough, Gin is also dealing with the usual shenanigans, which is just a regular day for her - people trying to murder her before she murders them. Such is the life of an assassin and underworld queen. This installment had everything I've come to love and expect from Jennifer Estep and Gin Blanco - humor, a dash of romance, a strong sense of friendship between Gin and her \"family\". I was also happy to see that Gin had a new sidekick in the form of Phillip, who was introduced in the previous novel. He and Gin work quite well together, almost as well as Finn and Gin, and I'm hoping he sticks around for a while. I've jumped around quite a bit in this series, skipping some and reading many of them out of order, and I have to hand it to Estep - she does a phenomenal job of quickly bringing readers up to speed without seeming redundant and boring. There were several things I'd forgotten from Bitter Bite (mainly the events surrounding the climax with Finn and his mom), and was clued in quite nicely. Bottom line - Unraveled is a must read for fans of Estep and Gin Blanco. Gin has really come a long way from simple assassin to so much more, and despite being an assassin, she still retains a sense of decency and morality, which is one of my favorite aspects. Really looking forward to the next book in the series because it seems that things are about to get rather serious in Gin's world. *eARC received via NetGalley in exchange for my honest opinion. **Cliterary Genius 2016 A to Z book challenge, letter U."}, {"userName": "Jeanny", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16737045-jeanny", "userReview": "eARC kindly provided in exchange for an honest review.Gin is an assassin not a detective & after \"The Circle\" constantly avoid discovery by proving to be one step ahead of Gin at every turn, Finn suggests they go on vacation.

Unfortunately for Gin her vacation skips right pass the traditional deep tissue massage & cucumber masks & heads straight for danger. Gin ends up participating in some old western fun except she's not the sheriff in this town she's the salon girl complete with vintage puffy dresses & old fashion heels. This story was filled with hockey get ups, conniving bad guys, & made for a none stop deadly adventure. The story also moved the overall arc forward with some answers to burning questions.

This series just keeps getting better and better. I can\u2019t believe that Unraveled is book 15 already. For those of you unfamiliar with this series, the lead character is an assassin known as The Spider, aka Gin Blanco. Gin lives in the very corrupt town of Ashland where she runs a barbeque restaurant called The Pork Pit. By the way, do not read these books when hungry \u2013 the author describes all the food and makes it sound so delicious. There\u2019s all sorts of characters in this series \u2013 giants, dwarfs, vampires, and elementals, along with us regular folk. The magic is a bit different, following the elements so that there is air magic, stone magic, ice magic and more.So book 15\u2026.Note that the blurb is a little spoilery. I highly recommend that the series be read in order if only to see how much the characters have developed. The author\u2019s writing has improved significantly. Where the earlier books suffered from repetition (especially about eye colors), the later books are better written.What did I think of Unraveled?Is it my imagination or has Gin gotten more badass than ever? She just can\u2019t wait to stick it to the bad guys. I don\u2019t know, Gin seems to be more gleeful at any chance of conflict. Whereas an earlier Gin would have stalked her \u201cprey\u201d for a longer period of time \u2013 this Gin just wants to get rid of all the bad guys at once.I loved that this book was set in a Western themed amusement park. It\u2019s a little hokey, but it makes for a very entertaining backdrop. It also allows Gin to be with Owen, Bria, and Finn for a little R & R, even though that doesn\u2019t last long. There\u2019s lots of action and tons of fun as Gin and the gang search for some missing gems hidden at the amusement park.The secondary characters are great, especially Gin\u2019s assistant Silvio. I love how the villains are like caricatures \u2013 they are just so bad and evil.The only thing that bothered me \u2013 and maybe because it was a regional choice of word \u2013 was the use of tobaggan to refer to a knitted hat worn in the winter. For me, a tobaggan is a sled, so I kept picturing Gin with a wooden tobaggan sled on her head.Fantastic series. Highly recommended. And the good news is that there is another book planned for January 2017! Yah! Thank you to NetGalley and Pocket Books for a review copy of this book.Review posted on Badass Book Reviews.

She cut off the head of the snake, and the body is still writhing, lol. It cracks me up that she compares running the Underworld to being CEO of the most dangerous company in the world. Full of people planning to take her out. Sure doesn't add to restful nights when you add in the Circle and their threats.I do like Ira. He's so real with a very real love for the park and for Sweet Sally Sue; he also makes some excellent points about how hard the performers work. Gin should feel ashamed of herself.That damaging reveal from Tucker triggers a number of memories for Gin. Some good, some bad. I'm guessing some of those memories have to do with Fletcher. Those bad ones\u2026I just know Estep is going to keep us guessing about the Circle and her mother's involvement\u2026argh!Hmmm, Estep has me wondering about those favors Mosley and Fletcher \"exchanged\".Unraveled doesn't include all of the usual core characters and only makes one real advance in the storyline. I will say it was fun to read, if only to \"watch\" Gin trap the opposition.The StoryThere are too many indications that the Circle really does exist, and Hugh Tucker claims they know all about Gin: her house, safehouses, family, and friends. Gin won't go through that again. She won't put her friends at risk.She'll have to cut off each and every head of this hydra. Meanwhile, why not skip town. Take a break, for Finn has an unexpected inheritance he wants to check out: Bullet Pointe, a fancy hotel resort complex plus Old West theme park. He's suffered a lot since his bitch mother tortured him, and Gin, Owen, and Bria will do most anything to cheer him up.At first, all the struttin' cowboys and sassy saloon girls are just hokey fun. But add in some shady coincidences and Circle assassins lurking all around, and vacationing becomes wilder \u2014 and deadlier \u2014 than any of us expected.When you're Gin Blanco, always bring a knife to a gunfight\u2026The CharactersGin \"the Spider\" Blanco with her Ice and Stone elemental power is the current Underworld queen in Ashland and much prefers running her restaurant, the Pork Pit. Owen Grayson is a metal elemental and Gin's boyfriend. Eva Grayson is Owen's younger sister (with whom Phillip is in love). Finnegan Lane is Gin's foster brother and a highly successful investment banker and a way with the ladies. He's also in love with Detective Bria Coolidge, Gin's sister. Silvio Sanchez is a vampire and Gin's very efficient personal assistant (\nPoison Promise\n, 11).The Pork Pit is\u2026\u2026a fab barbecue restaurant. Sophia Devereaux is a Goth-wearing dwarf who does most of the cooking. Her sister, Jo-Jo, runs a beauty salon and heals Gin with her Air elemental abilities. Catalina Vasquez, Silvio's niece, works as a waitress there. The Underworld of Ashland Phillip Kincaid is part of that Underworld AND best friends with Owen. Cooper Stills is a blacksmith and had been Owen's mentor.Jade Jamison is a smuggler who runs a variety of cleaning and other service businesses and is allied with Gin. She's also taken over the now-deceased Dimitri Barkov's shipping yard. Mallory is her dwarf greats-grandmother.Roslyn Phillips is a vampire madam and friend.First Trust Bank is\u2026\u2026the bank in Ashland and is where Finn works amidst some really bad memories. Big Bertha is its most secure vault. Stuart Mosley is the head of the bank. Jimmy and Tommy are some of the new guards.Bullet Pointe is\u2026\u2026a cheesy Old West theme park and expensive resort complex Dierdre owned. She's left it to Finn. Sweet Sally Sue, a wealthy coal baroness, was the original owner with expensive taste in jewelry. She had taken in Ira Morris, a dwarf, who had risen to the position of resort manager until Dierdre took over.Roxanne \"Roxy\" Wyatt is the new resort manager and a Fire Elemental with an obsession for all things Western. She plays the sheriff in a park performance. Brody Dalton plays the leader of the Dalton gang and has been Roxy's partner since they were kids growing up in Blue Marsh. More of the gang includes Ellis and Clyde.The Circle is\u2026\u2026supposedly the real crime syndicate running Ashland, according to Hugh Tucker, a nasty vampire. An organization to which Gin's mother, Eira Snow, supposedly belonged. Mab Monroe had been a Fire Elemental who was the previous Underworld queen; she had also killed Gin's mother and oldest sister, Annabella. Gin's father, Tristan, had been murdered earlier in a \"car accident\". Dierdre Shaw had been Finn's mother (\nBitter Bite\n, 14). Rodrigo Santos had been the professional thief partnered up with her.Jonah McAllister had been Mab Monroe's personal lawyer until Gin exposed him in \nDeadly Sting\n, 8. Fedora is an assassin.The Cover and TitleThe cover is deep reds with a bright red glow around Gin in her short denim jacket over the tight red T, deep blue bluejeans tucked into knee-high boots, her long brown hair blowing in the slight breeze, holding two of her silverstone knives in front of the swinging doors of the saloon. I am curious about that rune on one of the doors\u2026is it possible it's a circle with swords? The author's name (at the top) and the title (at the bottom) are in yellow with the series information at the very bottom of the cover.The title is how Gin feels, Unraveled with all that she learns about her mother."}, {"userName": "Denise B\u00fccherwunderland", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59623634-denise-b-cherwunderland", "userReview": "Vorneweg: Ich habe bereits sehr, sehr viele B\u00fccher von Jennifer Estep gelesen und die meisten haben mir sehr gut gefallen.  Meine Meinung: Hiermit w\u00e4ren wir also bei Band 15 (?!?) der Elemental Assassin Reihe von Jennifer Estep. Am Anfang habe ich diese Reihe geliebt und jeden einzelnen Band verschlungen. Nach und nach hat meine Begeisterung immer mehr abgenommen und von einigen der letzten B\u00e4nde war ich eher entt\u00e4uscht. Eine Ausnahme bildet da der direkte Vorg\u00e4nger zu diesem Buch \"Bitter Bite\", denn hier ist es Jennifer Estep wieder gelungen mich richtig mitzurei\u00dfen. \"Unraveled\" konnte mich am Anfang gar nicht begeistern, denn ich hatte gleich das Gef\u00fchl, dass es sich hierbei nur um einen dieser \"Zwischenb\u00e4nde\" handelt und ich hatte leider Recht. Klar, wie bei jedem anderen Buch der Reihe gibt es wieder jede Menge Action und einen gro\u00dfen Showdown, aber so wirklich hat das die \u00fcbergreifende Handlung nicht vorangetrieben. Trotzdem hat es mich gefreut wieder etwas \u00fcber Gin und ihre Freunde zu lesen. Vielleicht werde ich die Reihe erstmal eine Weile pausieren und sie in einigen Monaten weiterlesen.
