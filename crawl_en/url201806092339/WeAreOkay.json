Which is a pretty big thing to say, I suppose.What I really appreciated was that Nina LaCour abandoned the idea that a novel has to be entirely plot driven. This is a book about relationships and emotions and I liked being caught up in Marin's brain. I loved that it took place in winter, on an abandoned university campus, where everything amplified Marin's feelings of emptiness and isolation. I like that things like being coloured or queer were present but not plot devices. It all felt real and relevant. I also, and I cannot emphasize this enough, loved Nina LaCour's use of technology. I've made a video all about this, but I'm really irked by teenager representation that doesn't involve the internet or cellphones. Here it was masterfully intertwined. It never took me out of the story, it made it feel more grounded and real. I also loved that the book was short. It told it's story and then it stopped. It never dragged or wasted time. I love brevity, what can I say! I also really enjoyed that there was lots of cross-generational relationships - teenagers, parents, grandparents - because sometimes YA feels like a bizarre teen-only world.I'm giving this 4 stars because I don't think it was my perfect book. I think some of Marin's reactions to things were overly angsty and that there weren't many powerful moments. I said this is the type of book I want to write because it felt like something that Nina LaCour poured herself into, something subtle and strong, a message she wanted to share. It isn't a new favourite for me, but I appreciated it lots."}, {"userName": "Kat O'Keeffe", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4672379-kat-o-keeffe", "userReview": "WOW. this was definitely a slower paced book, but SO beautifully written and very powerful in a quiet kind of way. an emotional and complex exploration of grief and loneliness and healing and disillusionment. i am very much looking forward to reading more by nina lacour, because while i did really like this book, i personally tend to enjoy stories that are more light-hearted, so some of her other books sound a little more my style (like \"everything leads to you\" which i already own so i'm bumping it up the TBR!)if you've loved books by john green and jandy nelson and gayle forman, or if you're in the mood for a gorgeously written book that's both melancholic and healing, i would definitely recommend this!"}, {"userName": "Lola  Reviewer", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14596170-lola-reviewer", "userReview": "This is possibly the prettiest book I\u2019ve held in my hands. As pretty as the picture looks, the hardcover is twice as lovely. So I\u2019m definitely glad I enjoyed the story, because otherwise I would have felt morally obliged to donate the book. Nina LaCour doesn\u2019t write; she paints. Delicately and purposefully. Her words are colors that blend into one another to create a magnificent landscape. This is a book about family, first love, grief and solitude. Before she began college, Marin lived with her grandfather. They weren\u2019t close \u2013 so many secrets between them \u2013 but they had each other, which was more than Marin could have wished for.But one day, her grandpa dies unexpectedly and Marin is alone in the world again, for the second time since her mother died. Mabel is three thousand miles away, with a new boyfriend, and Marin isn\u2019t ready to open up to anyone.I could feel Marin\u2019s fragility and loneliness in every word. I can\u2019t imagine what it must be like to be without family. It can destroy a person. Tear them to shreds.Fortunately, sensing something is wrong with her friend and former girlfriend, Mabel visits Marin at college for three days. Will this encourage her to talk about her past and feelings?If I had to choose one word to describe this story, I would say it\u2019s \u2018\u2018quiet.\u2019\u2019 Tranquil. Melancholic, even. You must know this is unlike those novels that have dozens of events which form a plot. It\u2019s not about going from point A to point B; it\u2019s about digging up point A and putting its pieces back together.

Your favorite jeans and sweater. The jacket with the faux-fur lining to keep you warm. Your phone and your music and your favorite books. Mascara. Irish Breakfast tea and cappuccinos from Trouble Coffee. You need your yearbooks, every stiffly posed school-dance photo, the notes your friends slipped into your locker. You need the camera you got for your sixteenth birthday and the flowers you dried. You need your notebooks full of the things you learned and don't want to forget. You need your bedspread, white with black diamonds. You need your pillow-it fits the way you sleep. You need magazines promising self-improvement. You need your running shoes and your sandals and your boots. Your grade report from the semester you got straight As. Your prom dress, your shiny earrings, your pendants on delicate chains. You need your underwear, your light-colored bras and your black ones. The dream catcher hanging above your bed. The dozens and dozens of shells in glass jars. The cab was waiting at the station.

The front page with the one light in the dorm room speaks so many volumes to me. Marin is trying to make a new life for herself. She has a roommate in college, she's trying to get a job, which she eventually does at a wonderful place, she's just trying to live from day to day. She's alone while everyone is away for the holidays. There are a few left in the dorms but not many. And her best friend Mabel is on her way to see her. What is going to happen? Will Marin share the reasons why she left everything, everyone?I can't believe I have had this book for so long and just now found out what a jem I had. It went straight to my favorites list. Is if for everyone? No. But I'm not everyone. I'm ME. It touches a part of me that made me feel happy/sad/hopeful. Did I cry. Yeah. And that ending. I can't even.

No one knows the truth about those final weeks. Not even her best friend, Mabel. But even thousands of miles away from the California coast, at college in New York, Marin still feels the pull of the life and tragedy she\u2019s tried to outrun. Now, months later, alone in an emptied dorm for winter break, Marin waits. Mabel is coming to visit, and Marin will be forced to face everything that\u2019s been left unsaid and finally confront the loneliness that has made a home in her heart.\u201cIf our past selves got a glimpse of us now, what would they make of us?\u201dThis book came so unexpectedly into my life, but I'm eternally grateful that it did so. There's simply so much to love about We Are Okay that I'm feeling slightly overwhelmed writing this, but thankfully lists exist for me to break it down point by point:\u2022 We have a switching narrative between the past and future, which adds tremendously to the ongoing intrigue. Usually with books that have a similar structure, I struggle connecting with either the past or the present but that was not the case with We Are Okay. Far from it, actually. I kept switching my love for the chapters set in the past and those set in the present. \u2022 The author gets so many things right. From leaving your home and friends and childhood behind, to tackling loneliness, grief, friendship, f/f love, bisexuality, heartbreak, and talking about books and paintings, positive adult figures, and so much more. But I especially want to address how Marin\u2019s broken longing felt so palpable. I could virtually feel her grief coming off the page, which is by no means an easy feat to achieve in writing.\u2022 Speaking of, LaCour's words blew me off the page. I just loved how certain scenes drew a perfectly fitting picture in my mind.Exhibit A:\u201cShe leans over our table and turns the sign in the window so that it says CLOSED on the outside. But on our side, perfectly positioned between Mabel\u2019s place and mine, it says OPEN. If this were a short story, it would mean something.\u201dI had to laugh at how witty that passage was.And then hiding my smile at this gentle and still scene following at nighttime:\u201cSo I turn over and find Mabel closer to me than I\u2019d realized. I wait a minute there to see if she\u2019ll move away, but she doesn\u2019t. I wrap my arm around her waist, and she relaxes into me. My head nestles in the curve behind her neck; my knees pull up to fit the space behind hers.She might be asleep. I\u2019ll only stay here for a couple of minutes. Only until I thaw completely. Until it\u2019s enough to remind me what it feels like to be close to another person, enough to last me for another span of months. I breathe her in. Tell myself I need to turn away.Soon. But not yet.\u201cDon\u2019t disappear again,\u201d she says. \u201cOkay?\u201dHer hair is soft against my face.\u201cPromise me.\u201d\u201cI promise.\u201dMy heart. These two have my heart.\u2022 The summer chapters are set in San Francisco, mainly at the beach, which is one of my all-time favorite locations.\u201cTourists descended onto our beach, sat in our usual places, so we borrowed Ana\u2019s car and crossed the Golden Gate to find a tiny piece of ocean to have for ourselves. We ate fish-and-chips in a dark pub that belonged in a different country, and we collected beach glass instead of shells, and we kissed in the redwoods, we kissed in the water, we kissed in movie theaters all over the city during matinees and late-night showings. We kissed in bookstores and record stores and dressing rooms. We kissed outside of the Lexington because we were too young to get in. We looked inside its doors at all the women there with short hair and long hair, lipstick and tattoos, tight dresses and tight jeans, button-ups and camisoles, and we pictured ourselves among them.\u201d\n\u2022 And since Marin\u2019s from San Francisco but moved to NYC for college, the winter chapters set for the perfectly gloomy and quiet atmosphere. And as this books mentions, \u201cIt was quiet, maybe, but it wasn\u2019t simple.\u201d\u2022 I loved the attention paid to details. You could tell how much the story meant to the author just by little things such as the names of the girls:\u201cJust different enough,\u201d I said.\u201cAs usual.\u201dSince we\u2019d met, we had a thing for our names\u2019 symmetry. An M followed by a vowel, then a consonant, then a vowel, then a consonant. We thought it was important. We thought it must have meant something. Like a similar feeling must have passed through our mothers as they named us. Like destiny was at work already. We may have been in different countries, but it was only a matter of time before we would collide into each other.\u201d\u2022 And now that I've successfully circled back to my favorites, I have to talk about how stunningly earnest their relationship felt. We get to see them through all the stages: from strangers to friends to lovers to something more to something undefinable and then... And then going back and forth until they find their footing. It was everything I wanted and more. They're so good for one another.\u2022 Like I wrote in my review for Queens of Geek, I live for books that write about girls. Girls supporting girls. Girls loving girls. Girls, girls, girls!!! And so this book fulfilled my heart while reading about Marin's remarkable roommate and compassionate new boss and noteworthy best friend.\u201cI look at her. I wish her everything good. A friendly cab driver and short lines through security. A flight with no turbulence and an empty seat next to her. A beautiful Christmas. I wish her more happiness than can fit in a person. I wish her the kind of happiness that spills over.\u201dThis is still one of the kindest things I\u2019ve ever read. My eyes are burning again.\n\u2022 Side note: the amount of times my eyes teared up while reading was low-key alarming. But it was like I couldn't help it, especially towards the end. Like Marin said, \u201cI was crying, trying not to cry.\u201d We Are Okay is tragic and hopeful and morose and every adjective in the world that will help encompass the beauty of this story.\u2022 And last but not least, I delighted in the fact that the families played such a big part in this book. Specifically centering on Mabel's Mexican-American family and how fervently they welcomed Marin with open arms. Ana and Javier are two of the kindest souls and made my heart swell more than once with their words and actions.All in all: I'm beyond grateful that I picked this up on a whim because I don't think I'll find anything like it soon. But I know that I'll look forward to any of Nina LaCour's future works to come out.P.S. This song felt really fitting for the mood this story is conveying (since it also mentions summertime and being seventeen and drinking whiskey). I listened to it on repeat until, to paraphrase this book, its sound turned to nothing.\nNote: I'm an Amazon Affiliate.

My thoughts are lying face down on the floor with passion and I just wish someone could put a blanket over them and tell them they're fine. And I swear it's like  every book makes me sad in a different way but really...it\u2019s all the same. So yeah. I guess I'm just going to keep arranging words until something slips out and everyone claps and someone feels something??\n\u201cI was okay just a moment ago. I will learn how to be okay again.\u201d\n(x)This book was so full of sadness and loneliness that it might as well have been made of it. You're reading and your heart feels like someone is crushing it so slowly with a combine harvester and you just want to lay your head down on a soft bread roll and maybe just be quiet for a bit. You're reading and lying on your side and a little tear trickles into your ear (which is the most tragic of all eye moisture) because you're both sad and dramatic and listening to this song and thinking that your heart would actually envelop Marin in blankets if it had arms or blankets.It goes like this:Marin's story starts and you know something tragic has happened and she's left everything behind but you don't know the whys or the hows. You guess maybe it has something to do with her grandfather and the things left unspoken and unanswered (like the room where she never sat foot and the picture he \"couldn't\" find). Or maybe it was Mabel and somewhere between them walking to the beach in sweats with a blanket and alcohol and sitting on the shore kissing and the three thousand miles she traveled to see her... something went terribly wrong.See at this point, you don't really know Marin's story, but something about her words and feelings resonates with you so accurately, so intimately. There's no tangible plot yet but still... it feels as if someone has dipped their finger in a lake of you and made a ripple that goes on and on and on.Your understand her kind of lonely.The kind of lonely that doesn\u2019t depend on your surroundings, that doesn\u2019t give a shit about the 300 unanswered messages from people that genuinely love and care about you, that is engrained so deep in your soul it\u2019s like you\u2019re permeable and your own skin can\u2019t protect you from it.The kind of lonely that just makes you want to hide inside yourself more, reminding you that you\u2019re just an insignificant blip in the infinite structure of the universe, brought into this physical reality when you wish you could just exist fleshlessly in your head so they can\u2019t see you and you can\u2019t let them down.You understand her kind of sad.The kind of sad where it\u2019s not enough to feel sad, you have to feel guilty for feeling sad because you feel as if you\u2019re manipulating the people around you by being sad, berating yourself for making a separate physical entity stop the process of their life just to make sure your bricks were still up in a wall. When you\u2019re constantly afraid that you\u2019re being too sad, too loudly, too obviously, that you have dug yourself into a bottomless hole of self-pity and the walls are too high to see anyone else\u2019s problems but your own and you're so scared it's going to ruin your relationships with everyone.The kind of sad that is just not fair because you haven't earned it. When your life is in such an objectively good place but then it all comes back at once and there is no escape, you have fallen back into a destructive mindset and you're trying so hard but it keeps pulling you back in and you feel as if you're losing your grip on yourself and you're just going to keep shrinking until you can barely feel yourself there anymore.And something about all of these things combined still makes me feel dangerously close to tears.\n\u201cI thought that it was more likely the opposite. I must have shut grief out. Found it in books. Cried over fiction instead of the truth. The truth was unconfined, unadorned. There was no poetic language to it, no yellow butterflies, no epic floods. There wasn\u2019t a town trapped underwater or generations of men with the same name destined to make the same mistakes. The truth was vast enough to drown in.\u201d\n(x)But what this book tells you is this: you will be okay. That loneliness in the moment is no guarantee of loneliness in the future. That feelings are transient and situations change and we just need to get through this rough patch to the place where things are better. That you can be content and happy but little twinges of sadness will always seep in and it\u2019s okay, because happiness has never been a fixed point in one\u2019s life and life is just a series of challenges and ups and downs and you must learn to go with the flow.That it can be hard and it's another day in the bathroom stall, sobbing for five minutes. Another day of giving in to depression naps in the middle of the day, another day of being unable to graduate from under your duvet. But then happy shows up. And it\u2019s your cat purring on your lap, it\u2019s curling up on the couch for a book, it\u2019s a girl smiling at you on the train, it's a rainy night and blankets and your soul is warm, it\u2019s a lovely comment a stranger left on your review, it\u2019s some stupid meme your friend sent you, it\u2019s finding money in your jeans pockets, it's in coffee shops and bookstores and sunsets and your grandmother's embrace, it\u2019s your best friend coming home from college in two weeks, it\u2019s your otp being canon and an uploaded new chapter of your favorite webcomic.Happy will show up. And you will learn to find it even if it\u2019s not where you expected it.And you will be okay.\n\u201cit\u2019s a dark place, not knowing. It\u2019s difficult to surrender to. But I guess it\u2019s where we live most of the time. I guess it\u2019s where we all live, so maybe it doesn\u2019t have to be so lonely. Maybe I can settle into it, cozy up to it, make a home inside uncertainty.\u201d"}, {"userName": "emma", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32879029-emma", "userReview": "The person who will like this book is a very particular one.If you don\u2019t like character-driven stuff, STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK.

It\u2019s illegal for you to give this one star!!!\u201dExcept for Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland. Because I\u2019m currently thirty-seven months away from achieving the \u201csole Goodreads admin\u201d phase of my eighteen-step world domination program, and when that happens it literally will be impossible for you to give one star to the greatest book of all time.If you think about it, I\u2019m really just being considerate.But back to this point I\u2019m procrastinating.Here\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to sidestep, but will eventually just have to come out and say in some way, shape, or form, and I may as well do so succinctly and now:If you don\u2019t like this book, I think you\u2019re wrong.The major complaint I\u2019ve seen about it is that it\u2019s \u201cboring.\u201d And I get that. And like, I\u2019m really sorry, but depression is not exactly a day trip to the amusement park. So it\u2019s not going to rank alongside heists and nefarious plotting and research montages in terms of top-five most entertaining storylines.But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not an important book.If you don\u2019t want to read a depiction of mourning and depression and a semi-realistically-staged healing process, that\u2019s fair - so just STAY AWAY. Don\u2019t blame the book for being boring. It\u2019s not fun to be depressed.There were bits of the overall depiction that I didn\u2019t like. Things that felt too convenient, or dramatic, or cheesy. There was a strange twist I never understood, and the relationship at the core of the text confused me to no end, and there was maybe a little too much hope. (Depression isn\u2019t there and gone.)But generally, this is one of the better renditions of depression I\u2019ve seen in YA. It\u2019s also so f*cking good at discussing some of the difficulties of going to college. It captures that initial loneliness.(Wow. I\u2019m really making myself excited to start all over again when I start at a whole new college at the end of the summer. Yay, transferring.)Jesus Christ I wish I had a half star. This book was not a three star read, but I\u2019m equally opposed to giving it four, goddamn it.Anyway. I feel preach-y and I hate myself for it and I want to shut up. So I\u2019m just going to say this book is also beautifully written and then throw in some quotes and leave.Bottom line: Only read it if you know what you\u2019re getting into.

It is a book to feel, a book to hurt, and a book to heal. The thing I keep coming back to about this book is the \ncharacter development.\n This is a book specifically about the regret of Marin. Marin at once does not want Mabel here, regrets her being here, but also desperately wants Mabel to love her. She has walls up and she wants them down but she is terrified for them to ever come down. Marin has lost everything, including Mabel. Her best friend. Her friend, her maybe something, who she has lost. And let me be clear, it\u2019s not a romance between them. That is what is perhaps the saddest part. I once saw Nina LaCour talk about this, and she said something I thing is really true: being queer and in love with your best friend is different than being straight and in love with your best friend. One is an experience in first love, and one is also that, but with an added experience of fear \u2013 not of rejection but of disgust. We have learned to be ashamed of love and we carry that with us, through thick and through thin. This book was very Well Written and very underplayed and somewhat slow. But I think it\u2019s a book worth reading. It won\u2019t leave you quickly. This is a book about learning the people you used to love were something beyond what you believed them to be. It is a book about learning to move on. But I think most of all, it is a book about \nlearning to be with yourself and be with your grief.\n \nI could say the night felt magical, but that would be embellishment. That would be romanticization.What it actually felt like was life.\nI\u2019ve been trying to understand for months how I felt about this book because I think sitting on something like this is absolutely essential.

Soon after, I saw several 'low' . I was still curious. I knew parts of this book took place in the SF Bay Area... parts in New York....plus I had read that the author, Nina LaCour, lives in Oakland, Ca. I was 'jazzed'. How bad could this book be? NOT BAD AT ALL FOR ME!!!! I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!I read this book slow over 3 days. ----The story takes place over 3 days too! It's a tiny book. It could be read in one or two hours, but that's not how I read it. I knew early on that I didn't want to say goodbye to MARIN!!! I didn't want to leave her... I just wanted to be there - with this young girl as much as possible. I wanted to tell her ---\"I understand the loneliness- the grief - the fears - the emptiness. I related to her and her situation. THIS STORY BROUGHT UP PAST MEMORIES for me..... .....of the summer between my Senior Year in High School and College .....of living alone with only my mother -passing each other like distant roommates. ......years of living in an apt. -- threadbare- just my mother and I. ......I thought of David Vann's book, \"Aquarium\", ... even though the stories are different. This book brought back feelings I had from that powerful book, too. ......I remembered a time - living in Oakland - around the time Martin Luther King died...of not knowing where my mother was for a couple of days - scared and worried.  ......I thought about my grandparents and their pawnshop store on Broadway Ave. in Oakland. I thought about my private time with my 'Gramps' before he died. I was only 7 when he died of a stroke - two years after my dad died of a heart attack.  ......I thought about all the many kids that grow up with with only 1 caretaker-adult.

Our daughter played the leading female role at the San Jose Rep. She was 12 years old. It was her first equity performance -- phenomenal show -- performances were extended beyond the standard 6 week run.  ........I 'still' wish I didn't have to say goodbye to Marin. I like Mabel too!! To me .... this is close to a perfect book! It may not be for everyone- but for some of us it allows our souls to sing!!! One excerpt: \"It was a summer of trying not to think too deeply. A summer of pretending that the end wasn't coming. A summer I got lost in time, when I rarely knew what day it was, rarely cared about the hour. A summer so bright and warm it made me believe the heat would linger, that there would always be more days, that blood on handkerchiefs was an exercise in stain removal and not a sign of oblivion\". I've already been reading pages again.

It was a very forgettable read, and it's just not the type of book I enjoy to read anymore. If you want to read a great Nina LaCour book, I highly HIGHLY recommend Everything Leads to You because it has a strong plot and great characters, where this one did not in my opinion.The one thing I will say that I really appreciated about this book was how it was super diverse but not in an in-your-face type of way. One of the main characters is a POC, and the two main characters both identify as LGBTQ+, but they don't put labels on themselves and it's never really talked about, but you GET IT.

This is a really fast read and focuses on forgiveness, hope, and coming to terms with the past. Marin is alone in her NYC dorm over the winter because she has nowhere else to go... and then Mabel comes to visit her. It's clear that they used to be more than friends but something happened to drive a wedge between Marin and her past. The reader slowly finds out everything as the story goes (it's split between Marin's current life and her past in California).The isolated setting of the dorm in a winter storm painted such an empty, lonely setting to match Marin's mindset and her reasons for her connection with Jane Eyre. You can FEEL the grief in the pages. That mindset is actually one of the reasons I took a star off, though... it was just hard for me to push through. I totally took on her hopelessness and this story wasn't a particularly enjoyable experience for me. BUT the reasons I didn't enjoy it as much would probably be viewed as a strength of this book by most people!I did like how the romance wasn't the focus of the story, yet their relationship still had a lot of depth. And it was nice to see slightly older characters, too. They felt like regular people I would know -- everything they did seemed super normal, so the writing was really strong!Check this out if you like realistic contemporary YA books about dealing with traumatic pasts or just want to see more normal rep for f/f relationships!Thank you to the publisher for sending me an ARC."}, {"userName": "- \u0317\u0300 cinnamon apple \u0341\u0316-", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68941034---cinnamon-apple--", "userReview": "\u201cI was okay just a moment ago. I will learn how to be okay again.\u201dthis book feels like a journal to me. i felt like Nina LaCour just ransacked my bedroom and found my nonexistent journal and was like \"hmm well she's sad and gay so let's make a book about that\" and the rest is history.i feel like 2018 is the year i finally read books by the authors i've been wanting to read for years. Maggie, Adam, Schwab, Becky, et cetera. and now, it's nina!! i've been interested in her books ever since Everything Leads to You came out. it's just because i'm a lazy ass who has mood changes and doesn't pick up her anticipated releases until years after. (i swear i'll read you soon <3). i regret nothing after reading this book.this book feels like a safe place for me. it's quietly beautiful, inside and out (look at the cover !!! ohmygod). while i was reading this, i was listening to soft piano, then classic taeyeon, then xxxtentacion's sad songs. you could say i was in tears by the first paragraph. Nina's writing is simple yet impactful. from the suddenness of marin's thoughts, to mabel's concern. everything just felt lovely and this is one of my favorite books so far this year.i think it's because i just relate so so much to marin and how she feels inside. i've felt her kind of loneliness countless of times. where even my favorite book couldn't make me want to crawl out of the hole i've dug myself in. i've felt her kind of sad. to the point where i'm afraid of being too sad, too scared, too loud. if her character was written another way, i feel like i would have given this a lower rating (3.75 stars probably). i've been in the same place as her\u2014i've experienced all the uneasy thoughts and emotions she feels throughout this novel. and i think that's what makes me love this book as much as i do.because, even though it's not even 300 pages, it still impacts you more than any 700+ novel could ever try to do.(x)i loved the rep in this: a latinx bisexual woman, lesbian woman. idk man, i just love when latinx povs are featured in books (and done correctly!) and it made me like the book even more ahhh. i absolutely loved the relationship/friendship between mabel & marin. it was so sad to read, sure, but you could tell they still deeply loved and cared about each other. i loved how mabel was always looking out for marin the best way possible, and how she made marin a better person. i also love how marin grew and how she finally overcame her grief and loneliness!!!! my babiessss.even though the book has an overwhelming sense of loneliness and sorrow, it still tells a message: you will be okay. that the sadness and loneliness you feel deep inside your chest will go away. it will slowly disappear, and happiness will soon take over. i know it may seem impossible, but trust me, it will happen. and that's what We Are Okay shows you.you will be okay.\u201cI wish you more happiness than can fit in a person.\u201dis it slow? yes. does it have plot? barely. is it very character driven? very.if we share at least SOME of the same reading tastes, i'm 97.99% you'll love this. it's a story about a girl who's grieving, who's sad and lonely and filled with too many emotions. and her overcoming it and accepting herself and being OKAY.(x)(also btw, i rec this for literally everyone. please read this book)\u201cAnd I think of how time passes so differently for different people.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Saania Zee Jamal \u03df", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10376232-saania-zee-jamal", "userReview": "If I were to ever marry a book cover, it would be this one."}, {"userName": "destiny \u2620 howling libraries", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15335689-destiny-howling-libraries", "userReview": "\u201cThe trouble with denial is that when the truth comes, you aren't ready.\u201dWinter break has come, and while everyone else has gone home to see families and significant others for a few weeks, Marin would be perfectly content to stay in her dorm room, alone with her grief, pretending that her life from before doesn't exist anymore. Life is never quite that simple, though, and Mabel is coming to visit, shoving her way into Marin's after. Marin has a lot of skeletons in her closet that need to be faced, but can she handle letting go of her denial long enough to heal - and to move forward with Mabel? ---This book is intentionally vague to start off with; you realize very quickly that the grief that Marin is recovering from has something to do with her grandfather, who raised her (as her mother passed away in a surfing incident when Marin was a baby), but it takes a long time to dig into the meat of what happened, and why it was so traumatic that Marin completely ran away from her old life, as well as all of her former friends and loved ones. Due to the ambiguity of the writing, I actually felt like the beginning of the book dragged a little bit. I kept thinking that there was no way that the twist was going to be a big enough one to be worth spending the entire book drawing the scenario out, but without spoiling anything, I will just say that I was pleasantly stunned by the ending.I didn't realize this was an LGBTQ+ book when I picked it up - because I have somehow been living under a rock and had no idea that Nina LaCour was an LGBTQ+ own-voices author - so I was taken off-guard early in the book when the reveal occurred that Mabel was not only a former best friend, but also a former lover; the detail gave a really nice taste of tension to her entire visit, and kept me guessing as to how their relationship would end up.The writing itself was enjoyable, though nothing truly remarkable; Marin is a likable narrator who has made some questionable choices, but not without reason. The way she desperately wants to still be liked by Mabel, despite having been the one to disappear on their friendship, felt so authentic, especially in the way her walls gradually came down. I found myself frequently frustrated by her choices, yet still completely in understanding of why she was making them.I can't say I really recall any parts of this book particularly touching me, making me laugh, making me pause and think, or evoking any other noteworthy opinions - until the ending, when I was completely and fully shattered. I sobbed my way through the last several chapters, and closed the back cover feeling like I had undergone some brutal, but beautiful, catharsis. The ending of this book alone solidified it as a 4-star read for me and put Nina right up near the top of my \"authors I need to read more from\" list.I would recommend We Are Okay to anyone who enjoys a solid YA contemporary about grief, family (blood-related or not), positive lesbian/bi rep, and a heaping dose of heartache."}, {"userName": "prag \u2728", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29249069-prag", "userReview": "This is a book about sadness.\nI wonder if we will become okay again.

I can understand why some people would find it boring because it is definitely slow; it isn't a plot heavy book, it's about the main character and her struggle with grief.Grief is such a powerful human experience to read about and the prose in this book completely nailed what it's like to feel alone in the aftermath of a big loss. The setting for the story (an empty university dorm during winter snowstorms) reflected the isolation of the main character Marin and I honestly just found it so beautiful and relatable. In a way it reminded me of a Haruki Murakami book- there was a lot of reflection on life and love and loss. I don't have heaps to say about this book. I definitely recommend it! I think the writing was super beautiful, there were moments that made me tear up. A lot of people wouldn't enjoy it because it is a slower book.

At first I thought the \u201ctragedy\u201d being referenced was going to be of the rapey variety and, pardon me, but rape being turned into a tired trope pretty much makes me want to barf. However, I\u2019m no quitter (or more like I am missing the gene that would allow me to quit) so I continued on and basically ended up reading what amounts to be a pretty standard story of a young woman transitioning into adulthood via her first year far away from home. She\u2019s lonely, she doesn\u2019t know what she wants to be when she grows up, she\u2019s having a bit of a hard time making new friends, she misses the high school love interest she left behind but isn\u2019t sure where they stand. The only thing that makes this different from many teens\u2019 transition to college is that she suffered a loss on top of everything else. The plot is fairly simple without a lot of action. It does the wibbly wobbly between past and present and, for me, the past were the parts that held my interest.

But alas, We Are Okay is not a book about that, it appears to be about the things well covered by it must be hundreds of YA books about grief and loss.

It really demonstrates how betrayal, heartbreak, and loyalty can change a person to their core. I have not read anything else by LaCour but I will be fixing this soon because her writing is just so beautiful! I recommend this to anyone because it is just an incredible little book."}, {"userName": "Puck", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18562856-puck", "userReview": "An intimate and honest book about grief, We Are Okay tells us about Marin who suffers from the loss of her grandfather four months ago. In silence and in loneliness she keeps the tragedy to herself, but now her childhood friend Mabel comes to visit, Marin finally has to face her past and her emotions. \u201cThe trouble with denial is that when the truth comes, you aren't ready.\u201d This is a book about grief, loss, and solitude, but if I had to describe this story in one word, I would say \u201cquiet\u201d. \u201cMelancholic\u201d. The story takes place in New York in a snowy winter, at an empty college campus. Mabel and Marin are the only ones staying there, apart but together, with the past between them like a buried treasure chest. By switching between the college dorm in New York and San Francisco in the summer four months earlier, we slowly dig that chest up, and find out why Marin rather wants to keep things hidden.  \u201cIf our past selves got a glimpse of us now, what would they make of us?\u201d But although grief is the main subject, Nina LaCour accurately tells us about many different issues. From leaving your childhood home and your friends behind, discussing literature and art, female friendship, to lesbian romance: with her gentle, beautiful writing the author paints a story that feels so very alive. Slowly Marin\u2019s heavy sorrow will crawl underneath your skin, making you cry only she allows herself to cry, because then you both stop pushing everything away and look the truth in the eye.  \u201cThe truth was unconfined, unadorned. There was no poetic language to it, no yellow butterflies, no epic floods. There wasn't a town trapped underwater or generations of men with the same name destined to repeat the same mistakes. The truth was vast enough to drown in.\u201d  I adored all the different relationships in this book. Marin and Gramps, tenderly living together but each hiding many a secret from each other. Marin and her amazing Mexican-American family, with Javier and Ana as one of the kindest people I\u2019ve ever read about. But mostly I loved Marin and Mabel, who go from strangers to friends to lovers to something more undefinable and then\u2026they try to find their footing again.  \u201cMabel, I want to say. We don't have much time left. Mabel. There is me and there is you and the snow has finished falling. Let's just sit here.\u201d I teared up many times while I was reading, but the last 25% of the book I was completely in tears, from sadness and from happiness. This novel is tragic and hopeful and while not much happens plot-wise, the personal journey you go on (with Marin) is very heartfelt. I\u2019m so glad that I read this and I can\u2019t wait to read more from Nina LaCour in the future.Ps. This song felt very fitting with the story and the emotions that the characters face (my silence is my self-defense), so I\u2019ll leave it here."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2473504-jennifer", "userReview": "We Are Okay is a new-adult/young-adult realistic fiction novel written by Nina LaCour. The main character is a new college student but a part of the story is told in flashbacks when she was younger, thus: new-adult/young-adult. This story is complicated and haunting, but is told in a minimal style and the writing is just lovely. It's beautifully lonely if that makes sense. Themes include death, grief, solitude, family, friendship, sexuality, forgiveness, and secrets. After my reading experience, I wasn't depressed or sad. I ended with a sigh and a smile. That's what Ms. LaCour can do despite the heavy themes. I'm so glad I listened to the recent hype. Check it out!My favorite quote:\"How many times do you get the chance to do something over again, to do it over right? You only get to make one first impression, unless the person you meet possesses a rare and specific kind of generosity. Not the kind that gives you the benefit of the doubt, not the kind that says, Once I get to know her better she\u2019ll probably be fine, but the kind that says, No. Unacceptable.
