Dark twisted stories seem to brew out of these region of our friends from the North who have graced us with Tim Hortons, Propagahndi, and Alex Trebek (yes, those are the big three cultural exports from Canada, you can take it from me I got a B plus in my Introduction to Canada class in college). The book is a sweeping family drama set in a small New Brunswick river town. The central actors in the drama are members of two Black Irish families who hated each other in Ireland and then found themselves living next to each other in a small Canadian town as the more wretched of the wretched families. One family begins to better themselves and the other continues to seethe in hatred and envy. Add to the mix of these two feuding families is an Iago-esque figure with a penchant for lying but with the curious inability to ever realize he is lying who is also more than a little envious of the rising fortunes of one of the families. Mix these characters together and throw in some other unsavory elements, some dark secrets and murders and you get a novel that has most of the elements of a Greek Tragedy mixed with, well, Shakespearean intrigues. That's my book report. Oh, and there is a lot of GIN drinking going on in this book. This is the kind of book that I think Karen would love to read, and everyone knows that Karen likes good stuff, right? So, since she hasn't read this yet, you'll just have to take this a proxy Karen recommendation until she does read it, and hopefully like it (or maybe not, and I'm wrong), and when she writes a better, more entertaining and possibly more informative review than this one."}, {"userName": "Dave Peterson", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3527460-dave-peterson", "userReview": "It took a while for the author to wrap up this dreary tale and it made me want to drink."}, {"userName": "Phyllis Peterson", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12768419-phyllis-peterson", "userReview": "After 200pages I just don't care about these people and the writing isn't good enough to keep me reading"}, {"userName": "Brian Gard", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24147879-brian-gard", "userReview": "Great as usual.

The marriage of the young Irish Catholic woman to an older English man is thought scandalous, but they work happily together, playing music to accompany the films. When George succumbs to illness and dies, leaving Janie with one young child and another on the way, the unscrupulous Joey Elias tries to take over the business. But Janie guards the theatre with a shotgun, and still in mourning, re-opens it herself. \u201cIf there was no real bliss in Janie\u2019s life,\u201d recounts her grandson, \u201cthere were moments of triumph.\u201dOne night, deceived by the bank manager and Elias into believing she will lose her mortgage, Janie resolves to go and ask for money from the Catholic houses. Elias has sent out men to stop her, so she leaps out the back window and with a broken rib she swims in the dark across the icy Miramichi River, doubting her own sanity. Yet, seeing these people swayed into immoral actions because of their desire to please others and their fear of being outcast, she thinks to herself that \u201c\u2026all her life she had been forced to act in a way uncommon with others\u2026 Was sanity doing what they did? And if it was, was it moral or justified to be sane?\u201dAstonishingly, she finds herself face to face that night with influential Lord Beaverbrook, who sees in her tremendous character and saves her business. Not only does she survive, she prospers; she becomes wealthy, but ostracized. Even her own father helps Elias plot against her. Yet Janie McLeary King thwarts them and brings first-run talking pictures to the town.Meanwhile, she employs Rebecca from the rival Druken family to look after her children. Jealous, and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Elias, Rebecca mistreats her young charges. The boy Miles longs to be a performer, but Rebecca convinces him he is hated, and he inherits his mother\u2019s enemies. The only person who truly loves her, he is kept under his mother\u2019s influence until, eventually, he takes a job as the theatre\u2019s projectionist. He drinks heavily all his life, tends his flowers, and talks of things no-one believes, until the mystery at the heart of the novel finally unravels.\u201cAt six I began to realize that my father was somewhat different,\u201d says Miles King\u2019s son Wendell, who narrates the saga in an attempt to find answers in the past and understand \u201chow I was damned.\u201d It is a many-layered epic of rivalries, misunderstandings, rumours; the abuse of power, what weak people will do for love, and the true power of doing right; of a pioneer and her legacy in the lives of her son and grandchildren.\" (From Amazon)"}, {"userName": "Lori L (She Treads Softly) ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4592109-lori-l-she-treads-softly", "userReview": "David Adams Richards uses the life of his grandmother as inspiration for the character Hanna Jane (Janie) McLeary King in River of the Brokenhearted, a multigenerational family saga set in a small New Brunswick village. The novel is narrated by her grandson, Wendell King, and covers four generations of the McLeary/King family. Joey Elias is the family's nemesis, as well as the Druken family. Where Janie's tenacity helps her overcome great persecution and brings her financial success, her family crumbles due to her lack of emotional support. They are overwhelmed with the petty cruelty of their lives and become alcoholics.Richards is a brilliant writer. He always covers conflicting themes of love and hate, good and evil. His character development is exquisite. And while all of his characters are flawed and struggle with memories, faith, and integrity, often their reflections strike the core of a vital truth for all of humanity. Even as Janie's descendants fail to learn from their mistakes, there is the underlying sense that redemption is possible for even the most flawed characters and that in the end justice will prevail.The sense of time and place remain consistently strong in River of the Brokenhearted. Richards has a gift for setting the scene and placing his characters squarely in that world. Even their speech patterns are distinct for each character. He can also clearly record the irrational thinking processes of those overwhelmed by greed or drink and the explanations they give themselves for their actions.I am starting a personal David Adams Richards Fan Club. After reading Mercy Among the Children and The Bay of Love and Sorrows I can safely say that Richards is an incredible, amazing writer who deserves a wider audience - and a fan club.Very Highly Recommended; http://shetreadssoftly.blogspot.com/"}, {"userName": "Nancy Gillies", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14882358-nancy-gillies", "userReview": "Four stars might be a tad generous, but something about this book really appealed to me. It definitely fits the description on the cover of my edition of being a tragicomic story. The protagonist, Miles King, is a deeply flawed man who is unable to escape the influence of his powerful mother and roundly disliked by everyone around him (except his son Wendell) his whole life. And yet, it seems to be his mother's success and his bad fortune as a young boy of choosing to see some trained monkeys at the circus rather than keeping a close eye on his young sister for which he is despised. The book is filled with greedy, self-serving, loutish characters so Miles, who is a gentleman throughout, in some ways shines by comparison. Richards does a wonderful job creating Miles's old-fashioned speech patterns, and the drunken exchanges between Miles and Wendell are often achingly sad and extremely funny at the same time. I have a few quibbles with the choice of Wendell as the narrator because there are large parts of the narrative which could only be explained by an omniscient narrator and I didn't think that Rebecca Druken's character was as realistic as the rest, but overall I thought it was a really well crafted story."}, {"userName": "Julia", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1532455-julia", "userReview": "David Adams Richard is an excellent writer. This is perhaps the 4th book of his I've read. All his stories take place somewhere in the Maritimes. And all his stories are heart wrenching; about people living hard and dying hard. This book is no different from his usual prose. The narrator tells the story of his grandparents starting a new life in Canada, coming from Ireland. When grandfather George dies in 1920, Grandmother Janie takes over the running of their movie theatre - one of the first in the Province. She is trying to survive in a world dominated by men and is always up against Joey Elias who is a fiendish and unscrupulous man who is determined to destroy Janie and her children. But Janie's own determination and hard work make her prosperous, much to the dismay of this tyrant, Joey.It is here, about half way through the book, that I simply lost interest in the story. Every single character was mean, revengeful, hard drinking and just plain nasty. There was nothing any one of them wouldn't do to another, to get ahead or on top. It became too much for me to read... so I skipped through pages 200-350 and read the final 30 pages, to see how it ended."}, {"userName": "Stacy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4143381-stacy", "userReview": "I was one of the brokenhearted while reading this. It is true that DAR has quite the sense of humour, but there is nothing funny about the stories the characters have to tell, even when they are at their funniest, which is to say, drunk. I am not shocked by the depravity one can find in a small town, but in this small town, every day things, like going to school or the barber shop are tinged with nastiness. The writing is incredibly good, saving me from putting the book down. The only problem I had with it is that I can't remember where Cassie came from. All of a sudden she was just there and playing a huge role. I guess this can be forgiven in a narrative so well crafted. I love that Wendell King is visiting graves and doing research on his ancestors, which I do all the time. I have been lucky enough to find no one brokenhearted - so far."}, {"userName": "Paula Dembeck", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15166873-paula-dembeck", "userReview": "Janie MacLeary and George King run one of the first movie theaters in the Maritimes.

David Adams Richards writes a good story that gets you involved from the beginning and keeps you involved all along the way. It is similar in theme to Mercy in that it takes place along the Miramichi River in New Brunswick and is narrated by someone whose father was bullied in childhood and relates the effect that has had on the family. It spans two generations which brings the story all together. Some may find the story relentlessly disheartening with the mean-spirited people, but the brilliance of Richards writing is how he keeps you interested and waiting to see what the final outcome will be. He has become one of my favourite Canadian authors."}, {"userName": "CATHERINE", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5857462-catherine", "userReview": "I don't really know how I feel about this book. It was well written, but the characters are umsympathetic and tragedy piles upon tragedy. It is a miracle that any of them actually end up married - I am still unclear why anynoe would actually want them. The story itself is incredibly sad and depressing.

The setting is the Miramichi River area of New Brunswick, with two families recently immigrated from Ireland maintaining a feud begun in 1790. One of the families are the owners of a movie theater and drive-in from the silent era until the 1980s. Old Hollywood films and stars litter the novel, and the business becomes central to much of the action of the plot.
