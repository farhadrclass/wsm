Not God's hand. God don't make that gun on the hill to spit and chatter, He haven't created machines to fly in the air above smoke and drop fire in jars and bottles, to make fire on God's people, by God's people, to kill God's people, Lord, Lord.\" Nothing saddens me more - breaking my heart into a thousand shards of sorrow - than to learn of, read about, atrocities committed in the name of hatred and prejudiced. Prejudice spawned by fear, ignorance, and greed; blinding lust for power, gain, and control. Whatever form it takes, it all reeks of evil. And the evils unleashed in this world via mankind against mankind, are utterly mindboggling.\"Oh yes, listen. Evil is a spirit force, yes, but it have to manifest in the material world. That deep earth power belong to the material world, but it is capable to manifest in spirit. And we have let it. We have loosed our own destruction.\" Even more mindboggling, is how we as supposed 'civilized' people commit the most heinous hate crimes - rioting, looting, burning, shooting, maiming, raping - without a thought as to the violence we do to another, in actuality, we are doing also unto ourselves. It's my belief that one day we will be held accountable for our actions. Whether in this world, or the next. And we will no longer be able to turn blind eyes and deaf ears to our shame. Even the rocks cry out..... Rilla Askew pens with a deep passionate heart for truth. Truth that isn't always lovely, kind, fair, or apologetic. It takes great courage and appreciation to read the hardcore historical truths within Fire in Beulah. Set in my beloved Oklahoma. Oh the horror.... Oh the shame..... Why Why Why?????\"I turn around, see the world collapsing, bowels of the earth opening to suck that place in. Flames licking. Black smoke rising. Then is when I see what the truth is: we only going to save ourselves for a little while . . . We can't hide from it. We can't get away.\"She doesn't sugarcoat the horrors of Tulsa, Oklahoma's 1920s race riot which obliterated the Greenwood district - a prosperous up and coming community once known as an esthetically pleasing and financially prosperous \"Black Wall-Street.\" Nor does Askew shy away from the undercurrent sparks which possibly set it all off and/or fanned the flames in this fictionalized drama of real events: greed, mental illness, family/societal dysfunction, loss of reverence for God, and downright evil-mindedness. \"Oh, you think the devil of greed can't get you, but let me tell you something: the devil can shape hisself [sic] anyhow he want. If you hadn't steeled yourself with prayer and smoke and right thinking, he's going to jump up and snatch you out before you know what you're about.\"In the beginning, however, as it builds toward its horrific climax, one would think this a story about family secrets, untreated mental illness, family dynamics and dysfunction - all amidst the petroleum industry's oil boom days in Oklahoma. Race-relations seemingly being mere historical and cultural accentuating-elements, giving credence and adding depth to atmosphere, era, and setting. Adoringly, I must note: Rilla Askew is a highly skilled and passionate writer. Her prose is hauntingly brilliant and riveting. However, she does take literary risks, dancing outside the box of norm at times. It takes some getting used to her fusion-style: Native Americanism, spiritualism, southernism, grit-lit, mysticism, and literary-fiction. Yet she always maintains technical astuteness counterbalanced with richly poetic prose. True for this novel, and in Harpsong. Both, highly recommended novels for fans of gritty, literary-astute southern-fiction. ***** Five ***** Top Pick ***** Stars *****"}, {"userName": "Hennessey Library", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28274817-hennessey-library", "userReview": "This is a devastating book, hard to read, hard to put down, hard to begin, and it haunts the reader's day, especially the Oklahoma reader with some connection to Eastern Oklahoma and Tulsa. The climactic scenes of  Fire in Beulah  explode in the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921, but the book is less about race and more about kinship, Rilla Askew's recurring theme. The threads of relationship draw two women, one white, one black, more tightly to one another as the events spin out, and each woman grows gentler, wiser, as a dark evil engulfs them.It is a dark book, but not tragic. It deals with death and hate and prejudice and ugliness, but it is hopeful. It is cautionary, but does not preach. And it is uneven in execution, but tightly crafted. The beginning chapters are long and literary, raw and overly graphic with the theme of blood and birth labored as the first mother labors. The ties of blood flow through the book, but the final image changes to fire. There is one birth too many in the book, as unnecessary as the second mistress in Pasternak's  Dr. Zhivago . There is a long section dealing with the brother T.J. who has killed a white man and goes into hiding, but it has little impact on the progression of the plot. He reappears toward the end of the book as an important player with only a nod to how he came to be living openly again. He plays no pivotal role equal to the amount of space given his fugitive beginning. The entire section feels much like the Hermione/Harry trek in the wilderness of J.K.Rowling's final book in the Harry Potter series: Writing in place until inspiration comes.Do not be put off by the beginning, however. Rilla Askew is a master, a literary writer who immerses her reader in the sounds, smells, sights, and emotions of the world into which she invites. Her characters are flawed and ugly, but they open and grow, and we see in them the kind of dawning illumination we wish for ourselves, that which we want for the human race. It is this growth that makes the book hopeful. In all the horrors of inhumanity, we see that kinship can make humans transcendent and that hate can be subsumed by relationship. Her attention to detail is meticulous, and use of scents, masterful. Her mention of the pomade used so ubiquitously at an earlier time brought back for me a scent I have not experienced since I was a child. She makes the smells of a clean, well-lived in home as familiar as Mother's house, or Grandmother's, and her use of the smell of blood and sour-mash are stomach churning.Don't miss this book, and don't be daunted by the beginning. It is a must read."}, {"userName": "Samantha Manuel", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33697924-samantha-manuel", "userReview": "This is hands-down the best book I have ever read. Yes, it is deep and lengthy, but the raw nature, the intensity, the history!!! I heard Askew speak once, and she answered many of the questions that I had held about the book.

They say there's nothing like fiction for placing you inside the head of someone who is very different from yourself, and this book is a fine example of that rule. While the writing is a little overdone at times, I still think it's worth reading. I was interested in reading this because I grew up in Tulsa, and the story of the race riot was always present, but I had never really explored it historically. Fire in Beulah really personalizes the terror and inhumanity of the riot, putting names and faces on the perpetrators of the violence, the bystanders, and the victims.I can't say it was a pleasant reading experience, but definitely an important one."}, {"userName": "Amanda Wilson-McDougle", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37839515-amanda-wilson-mcdougle", "userReview": "When I think of the opening setting of Fire in Beulah, I do not get the image of a family like the March family in Louisa May Alcott's novel Little Women. Fire in Buelah has quite the opposite environment. The lady of the Whiteside residence, Rachel Whiteside makes the choice of protecting herself inside her upstairs bedroom. Her reasoning of not wanting the wind \"suck the life from her unborn child\" (3) seems logical enough. For the previous seven days, the south wind has struck the Deep Fork River in September of 1900, the turning of a new era. The wind blowing is not a calming peaceful soft sweet little hummingbirds can flutter to in rhythm. Rather, this sinister child of darkness \"cried and fingered at the windows till the sun rose, and then it went on blowing\" (3).In their mother's absence, the older girls, Estalee, Prudence, and Dorcus are the surrogate mothers for their younger sisters, Jody, who is twelve and jealous of Althea Jean, who is eleven; eight year old Winema who is the sweet animal lover and advocate; and baby Kay. The older girls are not the friendliest of mother hens on the Earth, and in fact, they can be viewed as cross and bossy. The older girls are sitting downstairs working on domestic house chores and don\u2019t want to deal with a bawling calf outside of their comfort zones.The eldest, Estalee, has taken care of the bawling calf \u201cwhen their father did not come home the first night\u201d (5). After this, Estalee spent hours feeding the cow. On this particular day, the \u201ccalf\u2019s bawls came from the corral in a piteous honking wail, the sound so loud it rose above the wind and circled the clapboard house, came in the shut-tight windows\u201d (5). As Althea sits still disobeying Estalee\u2019s command, she reflects on her own sorrow. Each of the sisters have exhausted their responsibilities in feeding the orphaned calf. Everything about the calf gets under Althea\u2019s skin. At eleven years old, Althea is at an ornery stage of her life where she wants to be noticed by her sisters. Instead, she is upset she is the middle child. This means she receives little attention from her mother and sisters. With the new calf and baby sibling, Althea realizes that she must give up an identity she sees for herself. In the first chapters of Fire in Beulah, Althea has no individual identity. Living by Deep Fork River, what future will Althea have except to grow up marrying a local man and sewing clothes for her children? Since the large monster in her mother\u2019s stomach turns out to be a boy, Althea wants to spare its life from the beginning. This does not happen as a wise woman of the Creek tribe is present for the birth. As the wind changes outside, so does the atmosphere inside the upstairs bedroom. Rachel and Althea are smeared in blood. The Creek woman makes a point of addressing the fact that there is much blood on the rug by Rachel. At this point, her narration does not go into detail that Althea has dropped Japeth \u2013 the brother \u2013 on his head but is saved. This information is revealed much later in the novel as the drama unfolds. Why would Althea not want a boy to be born in the world? In the 1900s, men are not common as, say furniture. Furniture stays, men do not. Father has left on one of his business endeavors. When baby Japeth is born, Rachel sees his black tongue and turns away in disgust. Later, when Graceful refuses to return to Franklin and Althea\u2019s home to work, she does not want Japeth around. In a later narrative, the Creek woman revealed that evil was born in the world. And evil was born in the world through Althea\u2019s brother Japeth and Graceful\u2019s brother TJ. As men, they partake in the worst race riots in Tulsa. Neither one are survivors of the evil force.The connection Althea feels toward Graceful is of sisterhood. At one point in the book, Althea goes into Graceful\u2019s bedroom and sees the family pictures Father spent with the Whiteside family in Little Africa. Father has brought back nice items for his family. Through Graceful, Althea\u2019s childhood has justice. She gets to imagine her mother taking the time to put her hair in braids, go on Mother-daughter walks, and make memories. As a child, she has an older brother who teaches her strength instead of being a painful spot in her mother\u2019s stomach.I encourage everyone to read Fire in Beulah. I read Fire in Beulah cover to cover in one night."}, {"userName": "Martha", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4752923-martha", "userReview": "This stand alone great book, published in 2001, is a must read for anyone.

It tells the story of a black woman and a white woman living in Tulsa in the 20's just before the race riot.

The story has rich language of the early oilfield and terms I haven't heard in a long time were used to describe drilling new holes looking for oil. Althea comes from poverty, but has hidden that secret well and is now the wife of a wealthy oilman. The story climaxes during the race riot and it is as horrific as one would imagine.

I never cared so much about the weather until I moved here. It matters so much.Fire in Beulah is maybe not the book to read if you're looking for a minute account of the Tulsa Race Riot. Its focus is, instead, personal and individual. Actually, it has some pretty deliberate callbacks to Gone With the Wind, but there is something charming about that book - Fire in Beulah has no interest in charm.
