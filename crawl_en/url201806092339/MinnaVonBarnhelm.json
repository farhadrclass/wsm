She's crafty and runs circles around the men with her wit. The plot isn't complicated, just appears so, since the reader is unfolding the secrets at the same speed as the characters, which is quite a clever technique, but I fear it will lose some readers who prefer omniscience to opacity. Best line, it is easy to like good people, but it's a challenge to like bad ones. Minna is successful with people because she accepts their natures."}, {"userName": "Nadja", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5903744-nadja", "userReview": "Ganz unterhaltsam, aber hat kein wirklich bleibenden Eindruck hinterlassen."}, {"userName": "Laura Deen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31854495-laura-deen", "userReview": "\"Wenn dein Mund nicht plaudern kann, so kann dein Herz doch reden.\" (der Graf, blz. 84)"}, {"userName": "John Hatley", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4161383-john-hatley", "userReview": "This is a very pleasant comedy, possibly one of the favourite comedies from the German Enlightenment, by one of Germany's literary masters.

It is often judged to be the most important comedy of German Enlightenment and a hallmark of German 18th century literature. Set in mid-18th century Berlin, the comedy tells the story of Lady Minna von Barnhelm, a young, rich and beautiful noblewoman from Saxony, and her betrothed, Major von Tellheim, the embodiment of duty and virtue. Recently discharged from the Prussian Army, von Tellheim is plagued by war wounds, contested claims and debts, yet he refuses help from his friend Werner, a sheriff and former constable, and only accepts assistance from his loyal manservant Just. Fearing he won't be able to properly provide for Minna, he wishes to annul their betrothal. Thus Minna and her servant Franziska have to cleverly overcome his honorable stubbornness by presenting von Tellheim's acquiescence to marriage as the only possibility to safeguard her honor - of course, von Tellheim obliges.REVIEWIt is likely that a contemporary person - even a contemporary German - reading the play would not think much of it and miss many of its subtler nuances. A part of General Tauentzien's entourage at that time, Lessing began to write Minna von Barnhelm in 1763, right after the end of the Seven Years' War (1754/56-1763); the play reflects several of his experiences in a military environment. The Seven Years' War in its European theater - also known as the Third Silesian War - began with the invasion of Saxony by Frederick II of Prussia, thereby preempting an Austrian attack on Silesia. By making light of both Prussian and Saxon stereotypes, namely by extrapolating von Tellheim's integrity and sense of duty ad absurdum and depicting Minna von Barnhelm as frivolous, Lessing might have tried to contribute to the reconciliation of Saxony and Prussia. Alternatively, as Goethe put it in his 1812 review of the play: \"The spiteful tension between Prussia and Saxony during the war could not be lifted by its end. Now more than ever the Saxon felt the pain of the wounds the proud Prussian had inflicted. The political peace could not immediately produce peace between minds. But this should be done through imaginary spectacle. The Saxons' grace and loveliness surpasses the Prussians' value, dignity, stubbornness, and a happy union of bizarre and reluctant elements is demonstrated on both the main characters and their subordinates.\"At the same time, the play attributes to the Frenchman Riccaut de la Marlini\u00e8re the role of the wasteful and dishonest scoundrel in a blunt manner (this was particularly criticized by the play's French reviewers, e.g. Madame de Sta\u00ebl, who were otherwise rather positive about it). This begs the question whether Lessing intended to foster reconciliation by focusing enmities on another nation; indeed, some of the play's first performances were without Riccaut. An even greater fear of censorship concerned the play's allusion to the king's discharge of the Freibataillone (\"free-batallions\") after the Seven Years' War, which seems to have flooded the country with disgruntled veterans. Nonetheless its success in Germany was astounding, in particular in 1768 Berlin.Another interesting facet of the play are the reviews it inspired in the early 19th century, e.g. by Franz Grillparzer or Otto Ludwig. These reviews, written after the Napoleonic Wars and during the heyday of burgeoning German nationalism, bear testimony to the struggle of isolating something genuinely German amidst the Austro-Prussian dualism, the legacy of the Holy Roman Empire and the persistent religious divide made evident by the Thirty Years' War and its horrors.Grillparzer (1822): \"[...] So truly German in all its characters, and therein unique in the German literature. There is no French windbag of a servant, his master's confidant; instead the bawdy, rough, German Just. The innkeeper certainly has a typical businessman's character; but then again Franziska! How loquacious and snippy, yet still a good soul and valiant and modest. No trait of a French waiting-maid, to which the German ones in life and on stage still owe their origin. [...] The language unsurpassable! German: plain and honest. [...]\"Based on the servants Just and Franziska, this characterization of the stereotypical German as \"plain and honest\" is still pervasive in the imaginary of present day Germans, often alongside \"Michel\", Germany's average Joe. Commentary sections below German media reporting on the Greek debt crisis are replete with narratives of the gullible and well-meaning German being defrauded by malicious foreigners preying on his naivete. Likewise, plenty of Germans have justified their rudeness or impolite manners by invoking the \"roughness\" of German culture, which sometimes is really nothing more than a lack of savoir-vivre.Yet the play is relevant to modern times in more ways than this. Its narrative essence contains several streams, which I would like to see further developed in today's context, though they have been the source of artworks already:- the struggle of veterans with injuries and reintegration into civilian life and the effects thereof on veterans' relationships at home;- the reluctance of men to depend on women vs. women's still-ubiquitous economic dependence on men as the main breadwinners;- the absurdity of strict honor codes unless tempered by pragmatism;- the influence of society's and peers' judgment on the well-being of girls and women, especially if their \"virtue\" is questioned;- manipulation between both genders (Minna's manipulation of von Tellheim, flighty soldiers' manipulation of gullible girls while on campaign).Of course, the union of these streams into one seamless body is the mark of a true literary artist like Lessing."}, {"userName": "Luca_schneider", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36771930-luca-schneider", "userReview": "Would like to see a play of it."}, {"userName": "Wickie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55116539-wickie", "userReview": "A Great Book about a Woman that Stands for her dreams and knows to Manipulate."}, {"userName": "Kathi Organa Sattler", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49008527-kathi-organa-sattler", "userReview": "Lessing ist einer meiner liebsten deutschsprachigen Autoren, Nathan der Weise ist einfach ein Meisterwerk.
