Believe me, I was very nervous!Vaughan appears to indicate that some time has passed since the last collection. It's easy to tell in the fact that at the very least, everyone has slightly longer hair. Yep, Yorick is rocking some lengthy locks.It's worth noting that some serious stuff goes down in this issue. Which is a breath of fresh air considering the non-events in book 7. We also see the return of Alter as we're treated to her unfortunate back story. Did someone say back story? Well, we also get a very intriguing one involving Dr. Mann.The series seems to have righted itself for the time being. I'm dying to finish this up.

In Japan we get action, adventure, and tension, characters with their lives in danger, some hints about what caused the plague, and interesting dynamics between Yorick and 355. It's all around a good story that moves along nicely [7/10].The Tin Man (#47). Dr. Mann's backstory is more interesting than most because because it's got emotional resonance. There's also more hints at the story of the plague and a pretty horrid modern situation [7/10].Gehenna (#48). Alter claims she's not a monster, but she is. I don't really care about the sob story that made her that way [4/10]."}, {"userName": "Darth", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40797312-darth", "userReview": "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.Goddammit.

Because poor backwards Japanese people!I saw this won three Eisner awards and I mean, like, thanks comics industry. Thanks for continuously awarding anything that at all upholds the stereotypes of patriarchy. (BTW I actually looked up Eisner award winners (for writing) and counted NO FUCKING FEMALE WRITERS (then again that makes sense because most men would *never* read a comic written by a female)). I mean consider this: this is a story about a \"gendercide\". All men, poof, dead. This is a world FULL of women. Full of them. And yet, they can't fly the planes, or keep the power grids running, or do, you know, any of that manly man stuff. This is a world where feminist means a crazy (literally crazy) woman who cuts off her left breast and goes around destroying sperm banks and any trace of men. This is a world where the single most important, main goddamn character, is a twenty something year old white male. And the other most important character, is a skeevy fifty something year old Japanese male. Oh wait, I forgot the third most important character, the monkey who--you guessed it--is a dude as well. This isn't a story about equality of sexes. This is a story trying to prove women *need* men and men make the world go round. Thanks, men. Really.

Like I couldn't figure out why I'm still reading this series, even though I've enjoyed it for the most part. It has gotten a bit stale, but there was some interesting backstory from a couple different characters here. The thing is, I've realized that I don't really care about any of the characters. Yorick could die, and I'd probably be surprised since he's the last man and all, but I wouldn't be sad. I'm going to continue on with the series, but maybe it's best in the future if I don't read any graphic novels after finishing awesome doorstopper fantasies.

It\u2019s clear that there\u2019s been a bit of a time jump in the main story (further proof that the last volume was mostly short stories being told out of order), as Yorick\u2019s hair has gotten mighty long (it actually looks pretty nice, especially with the mascara he\u2019s wearing\u2026but I don\u2019t think he\u2019d appreciate me telling him that). \tIf you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019ve probably been a nervous wreck the last few volumes waiting to see if Ampersand is okay, and if so, where the heck he is. This volume finally (finally!) gives us some answers on that front. We also get more background on Dr. Mann, which I sort of knew was incoming (there\u2019s no way she isn\u2019t involved in the bigger picture here, even if Yorick is too blind to see that). There aren\u2019t any new Beth sightings, so I\u2019m still feeling conflicted about what\u2019s going to happen to her (I have concerns she\u2019ll not make it to the end of the series, or if she does she won\u2019t be the Beth that Yorick fell in love with).\tThere are a lot of heavy moments in this volume, some of which the series absolutely needed to continue moving forward. Others are also necessary, but depending on your fondness for flashbacks they may be more annoying than revealing. Most notably Allison Mann and Alter; I wasn\u2019t crazy about either, but they weren\u2019t bad either (I think I was just anxious to get back to the main plot at the time those stories were introduced). While we don\u2019t see their backstories, we also learn a bit about Dr. Mann\u2019s mother (she\u2019s alive, believe it or not) and Rose. Needless to say this volume is a bit Allison heavy, but considering how involved she may or may not have been in the creation of this whole disaster, I feel like it was about time for that. \tI am so relieved that Ampersand is alive and safe, and finally back with Yorick. I also find it exceptionally fitting that he\u2019s terrified of the females of his species (okay, I can\u2019t actually say that he\u2019s afraid of all females, but he sure is afraid of the one). It was a moment of humor that was very much needed after everything we witnessed. \tI\u2019m getting really anxious to see how this series ends. I\u2019d typically put off reading the last two volumes for a month or two (because I\u2019m a coward), but I\u2019m going to push forward and try to finish the last two next week. We\u2019ll see how much they make me cry!

It's somewhat difficult to rate sections of one whole story. Sometimes it's really good, at times I've become annoyed with the story or characters, but my interest in the outcome of the group and their story has not wavered for me. Yorick seems to get a bad rap from several readers but I actually like him. I like that he is not a superbreed of a man but a man who's somewhat clueless and has evolved in maturity as the story progresses, someone who did not ask to be the last man on Earth. He's like a deer in headlights most of the time but that's as it should be. How would we feel if we were the last of our kind on earth? I'd imagine I'd feel just like Yorick. I love 355's loyalty to the group and I love Dr. Mann. Ampersand rounds off the group and is just as much a part of this little family that's been thrown together for better or worse.More than do the emotional review per volume I've decided to evaluate each one individually for how it's made me feel at the moment. Answers may be provided down the line that may make me view story arcs differently. For now, I've decided to just briefly summarize important story arcs so I can remember what each volume was about. I've tried not to add any spoilers but for someone currently reading I would suggest not reading this review further in case plot elements are given away. There's a lot going on in this volume. It starts off with the group newly arrived in Japan. There is a new addition to the group, Rose, who is the love interest of Dr. Mann.--Ampersand ends up in a brothel where a male android is all the rage amongst the Japanese women. The owner of the brothel has sold off Ampersand to a Canadian pop Singer, who's become the new mafia boss in the city. --Hero, Beth#2, and Beth#3 arrive in Kansas.--Dr. Mann and Rose find Dr. Mann's mom's lab where they startle her and mom ends up stabbing Rose in fright. Mom operates on Rose and saves her but during Rose's delirious stage she reveals that she's been spying on the group.--Toyota reappears and kidnaps Dr. Mann's mom.--Ampersand and Yorick reunite.--We see a glimpse of Dr. Mann's childhood and young adulthood and her tumultuous relationship with her father. Their competitiveness puts them in a race to be the first to clone a human being, which will bring consequences as a result of their pride to be the first to do so.--A glimpse into Alter Tse'Elon's childhood and young adulthood shows how she ended up being a fighter in the Israeli army. We also see how she ended up being connected to Yorick's mother."}, {"userName": "Tiffany Fox", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3500311-tiffany-fox", "userReview": "WOW were do I begin with my top 5 on this volume. 5. Yorik. From looking like a character out of Clockwork Orange to spilling everything to 355 to being bitten by Ampersand to being on his way to France seems that the next 3 volumes are going to start getting really interesting.4. Alter. Seems that she is back in the game of going after Yorik again. This time she starts off where she last ended at the installation with the twins and baby boy. Now she is trying to say she is going to be Yorik's saving angel....3. Hero and Yorik's mother is dead. So with above, Alter is apparently saving in one way she is Yorik's saving angel, but yet she took her revenge and killed his mother. 2. Dr. Mann. Things just keep getting more and more interesting. Through flashbacks we finally understand what her motives were for trying to clone herself. Also, she was a cute little kid, but an even hotter coming out of the closet woman. And now she is bleeding... Hopefully she'll be okay or be found in time since she seems to have been losing a lot of blood here lately.1.The story. I know it may seem like a cop out for some big reveal of a #1 but I really do LOVE this story. Brian K Vaughan does an amazing job with starting to bring things together for the remaining few issues.

This volume contains a bunch of backstory that seemed almost desperate, like the author was trying to prove that the stupid shit characters did earlier in the series, made sense in the light of these new revelations.
