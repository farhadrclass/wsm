A totally absurd premise, to be sure, but the authors really came up with an interesting way to make it more plausible. We are talking about a world where magic, superpowers, and mutations exist, so how far of a stretch is the addition of zombies? The first series was a bit better, but this one had some great moments, too.

I never read whatever came before Marvel Zombies 2 (1, I guess?), but I didn't really think there'd be much plot to it. Looks like the basic premise is right there on the cover. I would have liked to see the outbreak of a zombie apocalypse that took some of Marvel's greatest heroes down, but that's not what the sequel is about. This starts with Iron Man, Spiderman, the Hulk, Ant Man (ugh), Wolverine, and some other heroes I don't know... having eaten all life in the universe. It starts with the line \"Damn... I can't believe we ate the whole thing.\" It took 40 years. To wipe out all life on the universe.Aside from the fact that this comic spearheads another attempt to make me think Ant Man is not a lame hero (NOT GONNA HAPPEN MARVEL), I have some problems with the story here. The heroes decide to go back to Earth, to find a portal into another dimension to satiate their incredible hungers, and accidentally run into the last remnants of humanity, led by a zombified Black Panther (SPOILER: he becomes a zombie). A discovery is made: if they ignore the hunger for just a few days, they can push past their addiction and be good again. The zombie group splits in two - those who want to go good, and those who refuse to believe that they can change, or just don't care. It's a valiant effort to be good, but, really, you'd think characters like Spiderman might be a little more upset at having taken a life or two... or a billion. Or a few trillion (all the life in the universe!) I've seen him angst more about being home late. You'd think a little genocide would weigh on his conscious a bit?I feel like I missed the interesting stuff. This was pretty boring. Taking out the moral issues of \"eating everybody that ever lived, then snapping out of it, but hey, whatever,\" and refusing to really address some of the cool issues that could come of zombification meant that Marvel Zombies 2 was just another \"hero vs. hero\" comic, except when they get ripped apart, they can be sewn together after. And they have scary teeth and eyes. (also, COLONEL America? What, why?)The only really interesting character here is the Hulk (who disappears about halfway through and reappears near the end - literally, he puts somebody in a chokehold, and a fight breaks out, and he's nowhere to be seen?) The Hulk is not interested in getting better, he just wants to eat. Now. Bruce Banner absolutely detests what the Hulk is capable of, and hates the cannibalism involved... but is willing to kill and eat somebody, so that the hunger doesn't affect him enough to Hulk out and go on an even worse rampage. This is the only time I felt that the premise was addressed in an interesting, somewhat realistic fashion (saying \"Gee I feel sorta bad for all that killing\" ain't enough for me). I'm still going to give it 4 Stars because, while the execution left a bit to be desired, it's nonetheless a pretty cool concept. I will definitely be checking out the first one - where they didn't have to try and make a story out of it, and where I imagine the best parts of a Marvel zombie story can be told (its beginning, the moral questions raised, etc). It was a fun read, if nothing else. I still refuse to respect Ant Man though."}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16082088-mike", "userReview": "If you read Marvel Zombies #1 and left going meh, you might be tempted to skip on this series. But unlike the first series this has a good story line to go with the excellent art work.

It's the healing ability. That clause always gets in the way. It doesn't allow me to fully accept a zombie Logan. That aside, there shouldn't be anything that would stop me from enjoying the Marvel Zombie series, right? If only.The first volume didn't pan well for me, merely ranking an average review. Marvel Zombies 2, on the other hand, is merely a waste of time. It's so awful, I fear pursuing the series any further just to save me the money and agony - just a note, I purchased the two volumes together.40 years has passed since the events of volume one and the zombie heroes have devoured the entire universe. Back on Earth, an aging T'Challa is the elected leader of New Wankanda on the verge of an Acolyte uprising. When his assassination is botched, he finds himself mortally injured. The only person with a cure is zombie Wasp, who bites the dying leader in order to save his life. As the uprising reaches its heights, it is trampled by the return of zombie heroes. The battle of the interdimensional device begins. However, zombies are shown their proverbial mirror-selves and a decision must be made.I remember when I first heard of Marvel Zombies. I was sitting in the aisle at Hastings, scanning the graphic novels when a guy walks up to me and starts talking about it. I love zombies. I love Marvel. What's to stop me from loving this idea? Apparently the execution. The art is great. It ranges from comical to horror to the seriousness of the matter to the completely cliche - check out the ending. The writing and storyline on the other hand. Are you serious? Makes one wonder what the hell Robert Kirkman was aiming for.

The twist at the very end, although perhaps a little obvious that it was coming, was a great way to end the volume.

As I said, the story was ok, but it was not great. For me, knowing that Kirkman, author of The Walking Dead, was the author here, somehow, I think I expected a bit more.
