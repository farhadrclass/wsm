They sneak to the candy story but meet interesting people along the way then have to accomplish something to get home. A cute story with excellent illustrations. The illustrations really make the story. Running away when not supervised is probably not a good lesson but as long as it is a story...

We follow a tortoise named Toby and a goat whose name is Gertrude. (Pretty funny names, huh?). So, they live in this farm and some day they decide to go and visit a candy store. At the end they realize that maybe leaving the farm has been one of the most exciting things they could have done ever.I loved the art. It was really cute and it reminded me of some books that I read when I was a child. I recommend it to anyone, it doesn't matter your age, I think you'll enjoy this baby. Also, it's a really fast read so it's perfect if you're looking for something to read quickly.I'm really looking forward to read the second and third book of this series."}, {"userName": "Carole P.

I loved the behhhing goat named Gertrude and the wise old tortoise named Toby. There are references to the stories \"Little Red Riding Hood\", \"The Frog Prince\", \"Snow White\", \"Jack and the Beanstalk\" and \"The Gingerbread Man\". Gertrude and Toby's Friday Adventure is a great stand-alone story even if a child doesn't have knowledge of the other fairy tales.Since reading this book, I have found that Shari Tharp has also published  Gertrude and Toby Save the Gingerbread Man and Gertrude and Toby Meet the Wolf. I plan to buy all three from Amazon and have them sent to my grand-kids. I am disappointed that I can't find the books to order from Follett. I would love to purchase all three in hardbound for some of my library customers at school. I will keep checking back and hope that they become available. Jim Heath has created comical and colorful illustrations that add humor to this story. Shari Tharp has created a rollicking adventure.

It is perfect for young readers who have already mastered the traditional fairy tales (around age 6 or 7 and up). Young people of this age like to play around with familiar stories and give them a twist. You can develop this by encouraging funny or goofy renderings of familiar songs. They love this sort of game! This skill is exactly what Ms. Tharp develops in her first book in a new series. It is an enchanting mashup of multiple fairytales. Plot:The story is about a young goat (Gertrude) and turtle (Toby) who are best friends and have adventures together. Friday is their day for doing something \"big\". One Friday they decide to go to the Hay Bale Market for goodies/ candy. Along the way, the friends encounter several familiar fairy tale people (Red Riding Hood, the Wicked Witch, Jack and the Beanstalk, etc.). The author never gives their full names. The reader receives clues such as \"girl wearing a red hood\" or a witch with dangerous apples. I know that children will be so tickled with themselves when they discover the character names for themselves. Gertrude and Toby's eventually make it to the market but naively don't realize that they must pay for their candy. Young children will certainly sympathize. Toby is kept by the shopkeeper until Gertrude can come up with the funds. She races back down her path and re-encounters all the characters from earlier. They eagerly help our young hero. There is also a lovely little twist at the end which added another layer of fun to the story.Illustrations/ Characters:The illustrations in this book were lovely little water colors in shades of yellow, brown, red, and green. They help flesh out the world and give further visual clues to the story plot. Gertrude and Toby are adorably drawn with human-like faces and large, sweetly innocent eyes. All the characters in the book are drawn with their own personalities. For instance, the shop keeper shows a comical range of facial expressions that convey exactly what is occurring in the book even without words.Overall:I highly recommend this book and can't wait to read the rest of the series."}, {"userName": "Monica Dillenburg", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44482434-monica-dillenburg", "userReview": "This is a beautiful book, with a great message for kids. Like a fable, this one has a friendship message at the end that is easy for younger readers to understand but also illustrated the importance to listen to others\u2019 problems and how everyone can ask for help when needed. I read it to my daughter and she loved the pictures and how the fairy tale characters participated in the rescue of one of the main characters at the end. As a mom I appreciate the team work lesson for my little one. Something all children\u2019s book should have. As a reader, I actually find it really entertaining and well written.

And nothing gives me more pleasure than reading a good book, not even my favorite sweets, which I usually forget to eat when reading a good book. This book has all the formulas to a great story. But it's not a great one. The main characters are two unexpected friends, a little goat and a young turtle. That's it. The book never explains how such pair become friends and do not tell us why they enjoy so much each other's company but their taste to sweets and their passion for adventure...But if you pass all that, their Friday adventure was really fun. The author takes a nice walk through many known fairytales during this first adventure of the unexpected couple of friends and make you revisit your favorite characters from childhood. I'm sure kids will have fun, although won't ask you to read and read again.

The first page of this tale is written in present tense, which is unusual for a children's book so it caught my attention. Then, inexplicably, when I turned the page I was transported to the past via verb conjugation but it looked just like the present. This. Is. Not. Allowed. There are Rules! Conventions! Children do not need to be given books that will confuse their ability to properly conjugate, especially given the number of irregular verbs the English language is blessed with.The story and illustrations are perfectly cute but the writing is sloppy and awkward and I would cringe if I ever tried to read it to a child.

In this first installment of the Gertrude and Toby Fairy Tale Adventure series they grab the opportunity of sneaking off to market while the farmer is away.

I read this to my 5 year old who then point blank refused to sleep until I could promise her I could read the next installment. So many thanks to Netgalley, author and publisher for the opportunity to review this and the next two installments! This is a gentle and amusing tale that I feel could appeal to quite a wide range of ages. It's suggested for 6 - 8 but for a bedtime story it's suitable for younger. The pictures are really well illustrated, they are quite cartoon like but which really appealed to my daughter.

Every Friday when Farmer Sam goes shopping in town, Gertrude and Toby sneak off the farm for a fun adventure.\" This is the third book in the Gertrude and Toby Fairy-Tale Adventure Series and the first book that I have read. It is NOT necessary to have read the first book to enjoy the third. Each title works as a stand-alone story.Gertrude is a goat and Toby is a tortoise. They seem to make an unlikely pair, but they work perfectly in the story. In each book the pair go on an adventure and they run into characters from other fairy tales.At first I was skeptical that this concept would come across as fresh and unique, but it definitely does. I loved the fact that the pair head out to go fishing at Trout Lake and they decide that whoever catches the most fish will be the one to choose what adventure they will embark upon. As they are walking a boy runs by on a few separate occasions yelling that a wolf is close by (from the fairy tale \"The Boy Who Cried Wolf) and later in the story when a wolf actually does appear, readers meet the pigs from the fairy tale \"The Three Little Pigs.\"The illustrations are simply gorgeous and a treat for the eye. Parents (or Grandparents) will enjoy reading this story to their children just as much as the children will enjoy listening to the tale of the two best friends. I highly recommend this truly wonderful book and I believe that it will make a terrific Christmas gift. Since this book is due to be released in hardcover ten days before Christmas, the timing is perfect. I rate this book as 5 out of 5 Stars and I look forward to reading the first two books in the series as well.I received a free copy of this book from the Publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

I read it with my kids tonight and from my older, more mature children, down to my youngest(5 year old), they all had fun listening to the goofy antics of Toby and Gertrude. They also really enjoyed each fairy tale reference. As we turned the page and a new character would appear it became a race to see who could guess it first(we're not at all competitive in my household). *.* We all enjoyed how Toby and Gertrude weren't your normal farm animals and that they loved to create a little adventure to spice up their farm life of just standing around grazing in the fields. If/when you read it you'll understand that last sentence better. It was fun being introduced to the fairy tale characters in just a little blip and then to have peril come upon our two heroes that they reencountered the fairy tale characters, and together, they all save the day. It was a very clever storyline and one that I'm sure will keep many adventurous and active children engaged in the story and pictures. Probably even causing them to be asking for it to be read again and again. I'm actually really hoping that our local library will carry this one and the other books in the series(if not I will be requesting it and see if they'll be able to). The illustrations were great, my favorite is the page that has Toby and Gertrude racing(just like on the cover) back to the farm. Oh, I also liked the frog princess' kiss page and the Hay Bale Market page and the apple page and the...ok I think if I keep it up I would probably say that I liked all the pages because I really did.

These good friends live together on a farm and like to sneak away for Friday adventures. On one Friday adventure, they set off to the market for sweets. Along the way they meet interesting new characters who make appearances from the classic fairy tales, such as little Red Riding hood and the wicked witch with her basket of poison apples. These characters are not introduced by name, and it bothered me at first but upon further reflection, I decided that it is really very clever to let the reader figure it out on their own. Most children will recognize the characters and inevitably it will provide the spark for conversation about the classic fairy tale in which they star. If not, the adult will remember and either way, inevitably initiate conversation and hopefully more reading. It's a great idea blending new with the old classics.
