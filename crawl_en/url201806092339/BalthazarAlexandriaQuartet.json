He is now living on a remote Greek island a few years after the events of the first novel. Durrell\u2019s narrative and descriptive powers create an atmosphere you can almost touch and smell. Balthazar arrives with some notes/descriptions/ information about the events of Justine which sort of fill in gaps, create new perspectives, answer some puzzles and create new puzzles. The bulk of the novel is taken up with these notes. We learn more about Pursewarden (loosely based on Wyndham Lewis). There is also a long section about the annual carnival and masque at which a murder takes place. The novel ends with a brief interlude relating to Clea, who is as enigmatic as ever.Things are never quite what they seem is also part of the message and the added nuance makes the reader question their perceptions of the first novel. Different versions of the same story; it feels almost as though Durrell is mimicking the story of Jesus in New Testament. Durrell said the whole Quartet was about modern love. The language is luscious and feels venerable, but the themes are indeed modern, but they are age old themes and there is nothing new under the sun. The mingling of the sacred and profane in the city of Alexandria is modern, but could just as easily be a tale set in the age of the pharaohs. This was published in 1958, but is set in the 1930s, so Durrell is looking back through the prism of time and perhaps recapturing something of his past as well. Durrell was in Alexandria during the war; the model for the character of Justine was Durrell\u2019s second wife. Of course, a great deal of the sexual complexity in the novels reflects Durrell\u2019s own life; although the theme is modern love Durrell wasn\u2019t himself \u201cmodern\u201d in his attitudes. I also have the edition of Granta in which his daughter Sappho\u2019s diary extracts are published (not long after his death and about five years after her suicide). Real life themes mirror fiction.Nevertheless it is a great novel, beautifully written and I\u2019m looking forward to the next novel, Mountolive."}, {"userName": "Ian \"Marvin\" Graystik", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5022264-ian-marvin-graystik", "userReview": "[According to the dictionary, \"interlinear\" means \"inserted between lines already written or printed\".

He is giving the story depth. He is destroying of the private Alexandria of Darley, and now expanding the story to include perspectives from Balthazar. Darley has sent Balthazar the manuscript for Book 1, and Book 2 now replays some of the same narrative (some things are missing, some new details are added, some facts are contradicted, new facts are discovered). Balthazar has dropped his loose-leafed Inter-Linear of Book 1 off to Darley, who is now raising Melissa (and Nassim's daughter) on a small Greek island (just West of Smyrna.* Chios?).Again, I LOVED this second book. The language pulls me page after page. I had to stop myself from licking the page to get another scent or taste of Alexandria. The Carnival scene was intense and reminded me of a comination of Eyes-Wide-Shut and a William Burroughs trip.

I am glad that I read it, for it clarifies much that was enigmatic in the first novel, Justine, and it raises my estimation of the latter. Again the narrator is the author, Darley, now removed from Alexandria and living on an isolated Greek island with a small girl child, the daughter of his dead former lover, the tubercular prostitute Melissa. The little girl, who plays no part in the present narrative, is also the daughter of Nessim, the Coptic Christian husband of Justine, with whom Darley had an affair in the first novel.Balthazar, an Alexandrian psychiatrist, has sent Darley additional information about events and characters from the first novel, clarifying and expanding upon much that Darley thought he knew. And much turns out to have been wrong or significantly incomplete. I myself had found the first volume often confusing, and this second work made the picture much clearer even as it suggested that the subsequent novels may further elucidate or confuse the picture. The reader is in much the same position as Darley, forced to reevaluate his memories and interpretations of the actions and motives not only of other characters but also of himself. It is hard not to contemplate that one\u2019s own life is no doubt based on half-truths and incomplete knowledge of people and events, such that one\u2019s own living would be significantly different if such memories were different. It is also clear that \u201ctruth\u201d is a slippery concept, one subject always to perspective, knowledge, and inclination. Can it ever truly be pinned down, and what does that even mean?Many of the same characters inhabit both novels, but this second one fleshes them out, deepening their contexts and histories. Always Alexandria itself hovers just in the background, providing an ambiance that is various, decadent, polymorphous, and strange. Subtexts abound, and relationships and alliances continually shift and evolve. The resultant atmosphere is haunting even as it is often oppressive, the reader\u2019s senses being continually assaulted. It is hard to describe Durrell\u2019s language and technique, but his writing is mesmerizing and effective, impossible to forget. After having finished the first novel, which in retrospect provided a skeleton narrative that is starting to be filled out in Balthazar, I was unsure whether I wanted to move on to the second.

My goal is to get through all four books this year, but it is definitely slower going since I'm using the audio version. Narrator Jack Klaff makes great efforts to distinguish between characters but sometimes that makes me really hate the time we spend with some of them. Scobie with his whistled \"s\" is just unbearable in the car, and has a considerably large section near the beginning.What I love about this book is the way it fills in some of the details missing in Justine, and gives the reader an entirely new perspective on the characters and events. You find out why Justine marries Nessim, and it is not what you might expect. You learn more about the espionage side of things, which I of course enjoyed. But the author is also stepping back and reflecting on love and life, and Durrell writes so beautifully that hearing the passages again was like revisiting a favorite poem.The other layer of interest in Balthazar that as far as I know is unique to this volume of the quartet is the inclusion of two additional texts referenced in different ways. The novel starts with Balthazar visiting the author, bringing a pile of marked up pages the author had written about Justine, hoping to tell him the facts and background he never knew. There is also a novelist named Pursewarden who has died, and while I don't particularly remember him being mentioned in Justine he is a key figure in this book. Another moment of reading synergy I happened to have was reading The Butterfly Mosque: A Young American Woman's Journey to Love and Islam by G. Willow Wilson in the middle of listening to this novel. Wilson details her conversion to Islam in the first few years of the 21st century, as well as a cultural shift (she marries an Egyptian.) Durrell is describing Egypt, focusing on Alexandria, as its own character, right as colonial rule is diminishing and a shift in power is on the horizon; Wilson describes a much more modern (and much more Islam-dominant) Egypt. But between 1958 and 2010, there remain some elements that are Egyptian cultural practices. I actually felt I understood Durrell's Alexandria better after reading Wilson's account, particularly on approaches to love and the many definitions of marriage. Durrell wanted to write about \"modern\" love but the characters in Balthazar that aren't British are seeing it from a completely different perspective that even he may not have completely understood.I was surprised my original review contained no quotations so I will include some of them here.\"It is not enough, perhaps, to respect a man's genius - one must love him a little, no?\"\"Are we then nourished only by fictions, by lies?\"\"We live by selected fictions.\"\"At first\" writes Pursewarden, \"we seek to supplement the emptiness of our individuality through love, and for a brief moment enjoy the illusion of completeness. But it is only an illusion. For this strange creature, which we thought would join us to the body of the world, succeeds at last in separating us most thoroughly from it. Love joins and then divides. How else would we be growing?\""}, {"userName": "Lobstergirl", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1910836-lobstergirl", "userReview": "I'm beginning to think Durrell is one of the great writers of the 20th century. Really, the writing is just incredible. Like music on the page. (\"An Arab woman makes my bed, beating the pillows till they fluff out like the white of egg under a whisk...\") \"Baroque,\" I think George Steiner called it. Durrell said that the second two novels in the quartet weren't sequels, because that indicates a relationship in time; rather, they are siblings. (The fourth novel, he says, is a legitimate sequel.) You understand what he means once you begin to get into Balthazar. Time is not linear. We revisit not just the same characters from Justine, but some of the same events. As with baroque or classical music, there is the introduction of themes, their development, and their recapitulation. There are repeats and codas. Or, as Balthazar writes to the narrator, his manuscript could be described as \"some medieval palimpsest where different sorts of truth are thrown down one upon the other, the one obliterating or perhaps supplementing another.\" Someone, perhaps Darley, writes, \"perhaps buried in all this there lies the germ and substance of a truth - time's usufruct.\" Although I've only read half the Quartet at this point, I feel an analogy coming on - to the Gospels - the same stories told four ways, by four people - although in Durrell's case we have one common narrator, Darley. So here we have \"the Gospel of Balthazar\" or as Darley calls it, \"Balthazar's Interlinear.\"Durrell intended the Alexandria Quartet to be an investigation of \"modern love,\" so it's interesting that he chose to situate it in this ancient city. Alexandria is \"a city at once sacred and profane,\" writes Balthazar, and the narrator struggles to \"give a coherent picture of this impossible city of love and obscenity.\" What is modern love? There's a lot of sleeping around. Partner swapping. Hetero and homosexuality. People fall in love with prostitutes. People of different religions and races mate. The young fall into rapturous embraces with the very old. Sexual perversions abound.There are moments in the novel that shock you, as when the young landowner Narouz, riding horseback across his family's country estate with his brother, pauses to pull a human head out of a bag and toss it into a body of water. It had once sat atop a Bedouin who had been causing labor troubles. Other moments are hilarious - a parrot who recites parts of the Koran interspersed with fart noises - or surreal - the circumcision booth set up at the local festival, where unwary teen boys leaning back in the barber's chair hardly know what's happening to them until they feel the knife."}, {"userName": "Jonfaith", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2327886-jonfaith", "userReview": "I am just a refugee from the long slow toothache of English life.

The author points out that the first three novels (these two plus \nMountolive\n) all overlap in time, looking at the same events from different perspectives; only the fourth book, Clea, is a true sequel. Nonetheless, it is essential to read Justine first; the greater clarity and expansiveness of Balthazar is possible only because the reader already knows most of the characters and events; there is not enough explanation for the story to stand on its own.The set-up is simple. The narrator (who now has a name, Darley) receives a surprise visitor to his Greek island: Balthazar, the doctor who had played a secondary role in the earlier novel. He bears with him the manuscript of Justine, which Darley had sent him for comment, and has just time to return it together with his own interleaved notes and marginalia, before his ship leaves again. So Darley/Durrell is left with this huge volume of new material, which he calls \"the great Interlinear\" as though it were a sacred text. He realizes that several of his assumptions in the original story were mistaken, and so is forced to tell it again, sometimes quoting Balthazar directly, sometimes reimagining it in his own voice.The book is clearer than Justine in several respects, as though emerging from smoke into light. Durrell seems to use fewer unexplained foreign words, though he still breaks into French at the drop of a hat. The chapters are shorter and more clearly marked. The narrative dwells longer on a few connected characters, or a linear sequence of events. While the climactic duck shoot was the only action set-piece in the earlier book, there are many here: Nessim's ride into the desert with his brother Narouz, the street festival of Sitna Mariam, the Venetian-style masked carnival, and several others. The effective addition of a second narrator (Balthazar) means that not everything is filtered through Darley's sensibility, so other characters develop greater individuality through the cross-lighting. I am not sure that they all become more likable\u2014in particular, there is one scene with Clea near the end which strains my previous view of her as a hovering angel\u2014but it is easier to understand them. There is also more use of direct speech, so that the two older British characters, the writer Pursewarden and Scobie the old sailor, develop distinct (and rather funny) voices.And there is still the rich color and cadence of Durrell's descriptive language, a little overdone perhaps, but full of surprising word-choices and sharp observations, especially when capturing sounds:\nFrom the throat of a narrow alley, spilled like a widening circle of fire upon the darkness, burst a long tilting gallery of human beings headed by the leaping acrobats and dwarfs of Alexandria, and followed at a dancing measure by the long grotesque cavalcade of gonfalons, rising and falling in a tide of mystical light, treading the peristaltic measure of the wild music\u2014nibbled out everywhere by the tattling flutes and the pang of drums or the long shivering orgasm of tembourines struck by the dervishes in their habits as they moved towards the site of the festival.\nNo longer does this writing overwhelm the narrative it contains, nor does it merely decorate; rather, it articulates and propels the action, as this four-book sequence comes to seem less an outr\u00e9 experiment and more like a true novel of impressive scope."}, {"userName": "Nate D", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/406701-nate-d", "userReview": "Durrell occupies a strange position at the fulcrum of modernity. His style is often baroque and prone to exoticism (at first, he evokes 19th century British colonial literature above all else), but this volume, the second of his best known Alexandria Quartet, reveals more modern preoccupations besides. A perceptive character observes modern art's debt to theoretical physics, and so it is: the novel's tangle of disinterested and capricious love affairs (modern and age-old) shift and squirm in (quantum) uncertainty, resolving to clear positions only as long as they are, um, relative... to a single observer. It sounds silly written out, but that's because these scientific metaphors inform the structure subliminally and because they feel most correct to the material. Likewise, the structure of the entire Alexandria Quartet echoes our perception of space and time, with the second part/dimension deepening and expanding on the events of the first, from a largely atmospheric rendering to a psychological and philosophical study (so this is not a true \"sequel\", Durrell points out; they both cover the same time span).

I'm not sure of the extent to which this is meant to be tongue in cheek, because it is the sort of idea often found in satires of intellectual writers who don't understand much science. The explanation given for a quartet of novels the first three of which cover the same events from different perspectives is that they were inspired by the idea of spacetime most famously used in Einstein's theory of relativity - the first three novels corresponding to space dimensions, and the fourth to time.I particularly like the way that Balthazar is set up, the reason that the narrator is persuaded to revisit the story of his affair with Justine. Having published his novel about the affair (the novel Justine, in other words), he received a packet of papers from his friend Balthazar. These basically tore the novel apart, explaining that although things appeared in one form to the writer, his view was not always terribly accurate, his passion for Justine making it impossible to read between the lines. This naturally prompts a re-examination of his memories - from which comes the novel Balthazar. The narrator is driven to find out to what extent Justine really loved him. What did their friends - and particularly her husband - really think about their relationship?Since one of the interesting aspects of Justine is the way in which the woman is a symbol for the city of Alexandria, to reassess her and the affair is for Durrell to reassess his view of the Egyptian port. At least, that is apparently the case, because of course Durrell is perfectly aware of the ironies involved and is quite deliberately manipulating them. There are quite a few levels to the narrative, though it reads perfectly straightforwardly - particularly because the main interest in Balthazar is in the change derived from the narrator's altered feelings brought about by the letters which arose because of his fictional counterpart to the real novel Justine (and not forgetting that the real novel may not necessarily be identical to its fictional version) which he also narrated. But it is not all meant to be taken seriously; Balthazar is also meant to entertain the reader. As an endpiece to this novel like the notes that form Justine's afterword, Durrell includes some supposed quotations from novelist character Pursewarden in Wildean vein; among them is a little barb at those who take literature too seriously. This returns full circle to the suggestion that there is something tongue in cheek about the theory of relativity being the inspiration for the structure of the four novels - just one detail from a thought provoking novel."}, {"userName": "Sammy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4321532-sammy", "userReview": "What is Balthazar? It is certainly impossible to read without first devouring its 'sibling' Justine. The entire concept is that Balthazar - a supporting character from that book - read that book (the narrator Darley's memoirs) and is offering an annotation of them from a different point-of-view. You could perhaps describe this book as a story about character, not plot, but that would be deceptive: the characters are the plot. The journeys they make, the changes of motivation and destination, the doubts and fears and sudden spasms of fate that occur, the small moments when their minds realise something heretofore unknown... those are what progress these books along.In some ways, now that I'm accustomed to Durrell's style, I enjoy it more. Outwardly, he's pretentious - tossing in some French, Latin, Greek and just expecting you to understand it, making a discreet reference to a classic text or a philosophical doctrine in ways that are beyond mere literary references - but the fact is, he's not. Because, there's no pretense. This is genuinely who Durrell is and how he thinks. While one feels like he wrote this novel exclusively for the educated exiles from England of his era, it has a democratic way of looking at people that fits in with the American novels of earlier in that same century. I can't wait to read Mountolive and Clea now. The richly drawn characters of the first two books now exist in my memories like real people - loquacious Pombal, perverted and broken Scobie, pathetic Melissa, desperate Narouz, ethereal (yet somehow earthy) Clea, feeble Darley, bitter Pursewarden, rigid Nessim, sly Balthazar, charismatic Mountolive (as yet still reasonably underdeveloped) and of course the endlessly fascinating Justine. It is a testament to Durrell's skill that in two reasonably slim books, he has sketched not only these vast characters but the great and nuanced topography of their city, their Alexandria. Brilliant stuff."}, {"userName": "Alex", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3980317-alex", "userReview": "Simply the saddest, most beautiful re-telling of the events covered in Justine, yet with a richness that enhances the previous book and surpasses it. It's full of charm and musings on love, loss, life and the familiar yet painful uncovering of news that you didn't want to hear. All the while it adds a depth and complexity to the overall narrative (of the Quartet) that builds an excitement about the coming two volumes.Now I've finished the second book of the Quartet on my second reading I'm overjoyed that I'm only half way through the complete work. Durrell has achieved something rare - the fine balance between exciting the reader to want to turn the pages quickly with the lingering desire to take it slow and enjoy every word, sensation and image. Perhaps a short quote from near the end of the volume will sufficiently convey all of these points. Clea, a painter and also the character of which the final volume is named, writing in a letter to the original narrator, Darley: \"'For us, the living, the problem is of a totally different order: how to harness time in the cultivation of a style of heart - something like that? I am only trying to express it. Not to force time, as the weak do, for that spells self-injury and dismay, but to harness its rhythms and put them to our own use. Pursewarden used to say: 'God give us artists resolution and tact'; to which I myself would say a very hearty Amen.\""}, {"userName": "\u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0623\u0634\u0640\u0640\u0631\u0641",

This second book in \nThe Alexandria Quartet\n has to \"soak\" for awhile in this read of it again after many years. It didn't feel to me as if Balthazar tore apart the story of \nJustine\n with his \"Interlinear\" as much as the story suggests -- more just added depth and perspective to what was a perhaps a naive, infatuated, self-serving view. Stories of colorful and enigmatic secondary characters emerged here. Strangely, not sure I have a clear understanding of who Balthazar is as a character/person in the story. He was not a major character in Justine.Wiki tells me Pursewarden is modeled on the British novelist Wyndham Lewis. Justine drew inspiration from Eve Cohen, Durrell's second wife.The biggest joy in reading was probably the lush descriptions. I found myself wondering at Durrell's imagination as he created so many surprising similes and metaphors. Sometimes they did wander over to seeming strained -- did out flowing just overflow and the mind couldn't rethink, rewrite -- observe and critique itself?

Balthazar was the mystic philosopher in Justine who brought many of the characters together in regular meetings for study of the Cabal and other writings.  In this version of the story, most of which is a letter from Balthazar to the writer of both novels, new light is shed on the relationships between the characters. I found it more readable and engaging than Justine. Durrell still waxes poetic on the beauties, mysteries and dark sides of Alexandria, but situations which were enigmatic in the first novel now become more clear. The tale takes on a flavor of intrigue, both political and personal. The reader begins to understand that there was quite a bit more going on than a simple love affair between the author and Justine. Durrell himself has a grand intellectual and artistic scheme at work in the quartet which, in these days of novels as commodities, seems almost too precious. Reading him now is a look into past literary pursuits and made me see how much things have changed; even made me a bit nostalgic. But, as Durrell asserts, time is relative and there is no going back. There is only the continuum."}, {"userName": "Andrew", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/442654-andrew", "userReview": "I read Justine ages ago, like when I was 17, so I can't really comment on the comparison between it and Balthazar, but the book has a great many of the things I remember liking about Lawrence Durrell: his strong sense of place, and his writing style that reminds me of a lemon custard left out on an afternoon terrace, washed down with the last remnants of a gin and tonic that's now mostly ice melt.Delicate, impressionistic, nearly plotless, and with a weird-as-hell carnival scene towards the end, it's not going to be everyone's cup of mint-tea-served-by-a-Levantine-androgyne. But I quite liked it, and I like it more after having sat on it for a day. I liked how it tells stories through prosody and description of smells and tastes and qualities of light. I liked how it gets at the essential passive, layabout attitude of Northern expatriates in Southern nations (self included). And I liked how Lawrence Durrell seemed to have written this book for absolutely no one else."}, {"userName": "Ted", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7213075-ted", "userReview": "I liked the first two volumes of the Alexandria quartet very much, and for two reasons.

This review also gives away plot spoilers for both.\u201cBalthazar\u201d continues the narrative started in the first volume of the Alexandria Quartet, \u201cJustine.\u201d This time, we read of many of the events recounted in \u201cJustine\u201d from another perspective, that of the psychiatrist Balthazar, who unceremoniously disrupts and complicates our understanding of the events in \u201cJustine.\u201d A few years after the events, the narrator, whose name we finally learn is Darley, has moved to an island with the child that Melissa has had with Nessim. Here, Balthazar drops off what he refers to as his \u201cinterlinear,\u201d (a literary recounting of previous events from his point of view) that Darley spends much of the novel reading and meditating upon. His account completely undermines Darley\u2019s understanding, telling him that Justine was really in love with the novelist Pursewarden, and just used him as a decoy to cheat on her husband. And we read about Scobie, a mutual friend of almost everyone in the book, including Clea, Justine, Melissa, and Darley, who is killed while in drag, possibly trying to pick up sailor for a trick.In \u201cBalthazar,\u201d Durrell draws the reader to the meta-fictional aspects of the story in at least two ways. His account completely reconfigures Darley\u2019s understanding of events in the previous volume, telling him that Justine was really in love with the novelist Pursewarden, and just used him as a decoy to cheat on her husband. In this sense, Balthazar\u2019s \u201cinterlinear\u201d almost serves to turn the entire narrative into a series of suspect, but all equally likely, Rashomon-like perspectival takes, without any single one being allowed to be account for the entire truth. Durrell also uses Pursewarden as a kind of a novelist-cipher to shed light on the plight of the novelist \u2013 or, more broadly, the artist\u2019s \u2013 task. This ambiguity, which can at times seem heavy-handed, seems to mirror much of what Durrell is really saying about love, and especially erotic relationships in general: that they are a series of shadows, lies, deceptions, and figments of our own fragile imaginations. As with the first volume, the language is stunning, so just as in the first review, I\u2019d like to end with a bit of what I\u2019m talking about \u2013 those wonderful ambiguities and mysteries which so wholly constitute Alexandria and its residents for Durrell:\u201cI feel I want to sound a note of \u2026 affirmation \u2013 though not in the specific terms of a philosophy or religion. It should have the curvature of an embrace, the wordlessness of a lover\u2019s code. It should convey some feeling that the world we live in is founded in something too simple to be over-described as cosmic law \u2013 but as easy to grasp as, say, an act of tenderness, simple tenderness in the primal relation between animal and plant, rain and soil, seed and trees, man and God. A relationship so delicate that it is all too easily broken by the inquiring mind and conscience in the French sense which of course has its own rights and its own field of deployment. I\u2019d like to think of my work simply as a cradle in which philosophy could rock itself to sleep, thumb in mouth. What do you say to this? After all, this is not simply what we most need in the world, but really what describes the state of pure process in it. Keep silent awhile you feel a comprehension of this act of tenderness \u2013 not power or glory: and certainly not Mercy, that vulgarity of the Jewish mind which can only imagine man as crouching under the whip. No, for the sort of tenderness I mean is utterly merciless!\u201d (p. 238)."}], "description": "The dazzling second volume of \"The Alexandria Quartet\" - and enthralling and deeply disturbing work of gorgeous surfaces and endless deceptions.In Alexandria in the years before the Second World War, an exiled Irish school teacher seeks to unravel his sexual obsession with two women: the tubercular cafe dancer, Melissa, and Justine, the alluring Jewish wife of a wealthy Coptic Christian. What emerges in his sessions with the psychiatrist Balthazar, however, is something far more complex - and unfathomably more sinister - than neurosis.
