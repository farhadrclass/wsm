This book was never on my radar and I have a superb Civil War library but now I am proud to have this comprehensive history in a place of honor. This book does a superb job of telling the history of the Civil War chronologically. The book is more than that though because, like the tv series, this work comes alive with the words and feelings of men and women who were there. There are new essays from amazing historians including Shelby Foote that help make this a must purchase for even those who know the TV series well. A fantastic read that will be on my re-read list and a candidate for a desert island.My Rating: 5+ starsThis review first appeared on N. N.

And you may have relegated this book to your coffee table because it is a big, heavy volume. But please, get it off the table, sit comfortably, put it in your lap and read it. It has hundreds of pictures, many liner notes and loads of insightful essays so the actual text is not terribly long. In fact, despite is daunting size the actual history of the war can only really be a summary. If you want a detailed account you will need to read the volumes and volumes of work by Catton or Foote. This book will provide you with a helpful summary of the war along with detailed accounts of what lead to it and some interesting human interest stories. Borrow it, buy it, swap for it, but if you have an interest in American history, read it!"}, {"userName": "Kinksrock", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2228382-kinksrock", "userReview": "Fantastic.

It is like they are speaking right to you from beyond this earthly realm. The loyalty and faith great leaders on both sides inspired in their men who would follow them unconditionally stand up for their beliefs.... was inspiring. At times no food, odds against them,when it looked like all hope was lost they picked themselves up to fight for what they thought was right. The belief on both sides for what they each thought was the right thing comes thru in every page. The unbelievable suffering, sacrifices so many made and the losses of the ones they left behind is incredible. So many brothers, uncles, fathers lost. This is a must read for all. It should be in the school curriculum and if I were a history teacher it would be required reading for my class. :)"}, {"userName": "Tom Menner", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10395105-tom-menner", "userReview": "This was the series that really made a name for Burns, and the coffee table book holds up as well - lavishly illustrated with photos, maps, etc. and liberally mixing history and personal stories, similar to Burns' documentary style. This is not the definitive written work on the Civil War, but it is an enjoyable work on its own merits."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9501-sarah", "userReview": "This book gives a good overview of the Civil War era, touching on political, military, economic, and social developments. Purely an introduction, though--each battle is described in only a few pages and none of the events are truly flushed out, so more reading is necessary to get a deeper understanding."}, {"userName": "Kelly B", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/850957-kelly-b", "userReview": "Well, Ken Burns is one of my heroes.

That element of American history is mentioned within these pages without any analysis or commentary. It is merely acknowledged as part of the territory of war in any place or time.What is remarkable about this work is the thoroughness with which it balances the many views of participants, including their changing attitudes through their own experiences. The complexity of human nature is the core of the American nation, and this war is presented as the true creation of that nation rather than the earlier Revolutionary War. The reason why are also presented and explained by participants as well as modern commentators.Perspective is also added by reference to more recent wars, giving numbers and proportions of the population affected by these conflagrations. Such facts are used to reiterate the continual daily building of a nation by its participants. More than any other form of government, democracy refuses to take for granted the status of its citizens from what has gone before.Yet the idea of Democrats and Republicans in America seems to swing on different hinges than I feel I have been taught in Australia. The overlapping attitudes of \u201cboth sides\u201d of politics deserves greater attention within our educational institutions than skimming of dates and names in history lessons, and an introduction to the structure of the houses of parliament in social studies or introductory politics classes.Many theoretical texts are presented, or even literary formulations, without providing an appropriate framework for a student to understand the great wash of history that belies extreme positions and fixed metaphors in human form. The mix of readjusting priorities that face people on a daily basis come alive in these pages. The clash of overarching principles and more specific and practical necessities is not the same for every person within a country, a state, or even it would seem a single family.Democracy itself came out of an ancient society based in slavery of much of its population. The concept of citizen has changed over time for practical as well as political reasons. The love of the land that seemingly drew people to fight for their nation or country became irrelevant to those who survived and could have gone onto their own piece of land in the redistribution which followed.Above everything, this rendition of American history would seem to present the clearest picture of the absurdity of force to prove any rightfulness of living by enforcing so much dying. Yet other wars have been fought in the century and decades since. Absurdity thus seems the most enduring of human characteristics."}, {"userName": "Steve Morgan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43453880-steve-morgan", "userReview": "Great book. The book contains 100's of amazing pictures and personal accounts taken from letters and memoirs.

The house had originally been purchased by his former wife, Miki, with whom he had become reconciled and with whom, indeed, he had had a daughter, without bothering to get remarried. Given the connections to the area long associated with the family and forever associated with our childhood summers, I visited the three of them there often, staying at the old cottage or, after we lost possession of it, with them. Brother Fin is a reader, so I could usually count on his library having books of interest. Ward's The Civil War was one such book, read over the period of several visits. It is a picture book, but it doesn't stint on text as the appended description suggests. As a picture book, however, it is superlative."}, {"userName": "Grace", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5386320-grace", "userReview": "This is an audio book that accompanies the PBS video series 'The Civil War,' by Ken Burns. It is abridged, so it doesn't go into as much detail as the videos, but it hits all of the high points. It is read by Ken Burns, who does a fantastic job reading it. I always feel that the reader adds or detracts a lot from an audio book. I listened to this book and watched the PBS series simultaneously, as well as read several books on the Civil War at the same time. Even though this audio book is abridged, I found information in it which were not covered in the books I read. Not only was it informational, but I found it to be exceedingly interesting as well."}, {"userName": "Burt", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2148427-burt", "userReview": "If I were a high school teacher of American History, I would prefer this book as the text for the students to studt the Civil War. It is by no means a detailed history that delves into the politics and the battles, rather it is a concise account of both the politics and battles as well as the key politicians, key generals, and a smattering of the interesting \"bit players\" of the war. For my part, having read of our Civil War in some more serious detail, I found it interesting, well researched, and easy to read. It represents a job well done, as those four and a half years are extremely difficult to compress into a mere 325 pages."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/629059-michael", "userReview": "I was not yet ten years old when I first saw Ken Burns's monumental documentary The Civil War on PBS in the fall of 1990. I am glad I finally took the time to read the book based on that documentary. Much of the book's text is based on the documentary's script. Overall I enjoyed reading this book because I learned several things which I did not know before reading it. While this book does not go in depth into any particular aspect of the war, I highly recommend it for anyone interested in a broad summary of the American Civil War."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/820658-karen", "userReview": "As someone who has never before been able to summon the slightest interest in the civil war, I find it's helpful to have an overview of this huge subject. The Civil War, largely the text to the Ken Burns documentary by that name, provides decent survey to the topic, and as well includes lots of great photographs and excerpts from personal documents: letters, diaries, etc. This is giving me, a former complete ignoramus on the subject, the framework of facts and generalized understanding. I would recommend it as an easy and compelling read as a starter for the subject."}, {"userName": "Kim McCabe", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/759633-kim-mccabe", "userReview": "Fantastic overview of the Civil War that intertwined fantastic photos, letters, songs, etc to give you a feel for the times and the feelings circulating among \"ordinary\" people of the time.
