And a great one it was. I didn't quite feel that it was on the level of the early great ones like The Eye of the World, The Shadow Rising and Lord of Chaos, but it definitely takes the pace up after three almost disappointingly mediocre books.In Knife of Dreams, interesting things start happening again, and we start moving towards a conclusion. I'm in doubt whether that's actually a positive thing, seeing as that means this all has to end...Now it's up to Brandon Sanderson to determine whether this series will pass A Song of Ice and Fire as my second favourite fantasy.Wheel of Time reviews:#1 \nThe Eye of the World\n#2 \nThe Great Hunt\n#3 \nThe Dragon Reborn\n#4 \nThe Shadow Rising\n#5 \nThe Fires of Heaven\n#6 \nLord of Chaos\n#7 \nA Crown of Swords\n#8 \nThe Path of Daggers\n#9 \nWinter's Heart\n#10 \nCrossroads of Twilight\n#11 \nKnife of Dreams\n #12 \nThe Gathering Storm\n#13 \nTowers of Midnight\n#14 \nA Memory of Light"}, {"userName": "Gavin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8192509-gavin", "userReview": "Robert Jordan's last entry in his epic Wheel of Time series was one of the best books in the whole series. It had none of the pacing issues that have troubled the previous three to four instalments. The result was we got a WoT book with all the normal good stuff plus a ton of major plot advancements. Right from the prologue this was a fun and engaging read!So what happened?Spoilers ahead!!!Rand: He was fairly low key in this one but still managed to come to a few interesting decisions and had another epic showdown with one of the Forsaken!Mat: The star of yet another of the layer WoT books. We got to see him display a bit of his military expertise and got plenty of humour as his hilarious courtship of the Daughter of the Nine Moons continued. Perrin: It is hard to say how I feel about Perrin's role in this book. His chapters were pretty exciting as he finally got to that Faile rescue attempt he has been pondering for books, but I continue to be super disappointed by his development on a personal level.Egwene: She had another good book. After the shock ending to CoT she found herself back in the White Tower and it was interesting to see how well she dealt with everything they had to throw at her and how she won the respect of a whole bunch of different people. Elayne: Her first few chapters were a little dull, but her story picked up the pace after that and a few long term story arcs were finally wrapped up in a relatively exciting fashion. Nynaeve: She only made a tiny appearance but it was a memorable one. I think I'm finally warming to her relationship with Lan and I definitely enjoyed how things progressed for the pair in this one. The Love Interests. Faile and Tuon got most of the page time. It was probably justified as both had exciting POV chapters. I loved the glimpses we got into Tuon's mind. She is a little crazy and so unlike most of the POV characters that you just get sucked into her POV segments. Faile's chapters were exciting, but just like Perrin she really managed to annoy me with some of her actions. Min and Aviendha were just there. There was at least a development that holds the promise for a bit more excitement from Aviendha in the next few books. Random Secondary Characters: The most memorable was the return of Galad! Birgitte, Furyk, Pevara, and even Tarna's POV's also offered a good bit of excitement. The Villains: Most were pretty quiet in this one but we did get a few exciting encounters with members of the Black Ajah and the devious Darkfriends Suroth and Galina. Then there was an absolutely hilarious meeting between the Forsaken. Though the real impression was made by Semirhage. She really flexed her muscles in this one and showed why even the other Forsaken tremble at her name!All in all this was the best WoT book in ages and a super enjoyable read. Now I must admit to feeling a bit sad that this was the last WoT book that Jordan wrote himself. As much of a Sanderson fan as I am, I am still a little nervous over the prospect of him taking over the series. Rating: 4.5 starsAudio Note: It goes without saying that Krammer and Reading were fantastic. That said, the production quality of my copy of the KoD was not the best. The audio even skipped a few times. The flaw seems to be an the production end as even a re-download from Audible resulted in the exact same issues. For such a popular book you would think blunders like this would fixed. They have had nearly a decade after all!"}, {"userName": "Evgeny", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9340136-evgeny", "userReview": "This book feels like a roller-coaster ride after the last book. The action began right in the first pages of prolog (Galad and Whitecloaks subplot). Things moves much closer to the Last Battle; three of the most annoying subplots which dragged on and on during the last three books were finally resolved (Perrin, Elayne, and Mat). Below are my thoughts about the major characters of the series and their development.Rand shows up fairly briefly; one of the prophesies about him is finally fulfilled - I am talking about Min's viewing the first time she meets him in the first book. Her viewing about Perrin was fulfilled a long time ago, and the one about Mat has not happened yet. The ones about Rand and Mat felt like nasty one, and in case of Rand it really was a bad one. Poor guy cannot catch any breaks; looks like he also slowly goes mad.Mat finally returns to being awesome. His annoying subplot (yes, I used the words \"Mat\" and \"annoying\" in the same sentence) was finally resolved and in this book and it was fairly exciting with somewhat surprising if expected conclusion.I would give this book 4 stars even if it contained nothing else but a closure of a torture called Perrin Sent to Bring Mazema to the Dragon Reborn. This piece was largely responsible for the last book being extremely slow. It dragged during the last three books, but it started even earlier in book 7. When you think about it, imagine a guy with a small army being stuck between Shaido Aiel, Seanchan invasion, and half-mad Dragon Prophet: how can this be boring? The answer is, it can and it actually is. This part is also responsible for this book losing one star from its rating as the subplot is still slow. To be fair, I need to mention the last battle was exciting, but it was overshadowed by my huge sense of relief that this was finally over.Elayne managed to achieve something she was trying to do for the last 3 books as well. She also managed to kill hundreds of people who were trying to protect her from her own stupidity. I really cannot accept her excuse of the type, \"They signed up for this knowing they might die doing this\". Sorry dear Elayne, but when they signed up for this nobody told them you are too stupid to live. The less is said about this, the better.Nynaeve became the character with the most unexpected development. She was THE most annoying character in the first 3 books. Who would have thought at that time that she will say and do something which gives people goosebumps just from reading this? She actually did, and this became one of the most known quotes from the series. She does not have a lot of screen-time in here, but she uses it well.Egwene tries to do the best under the circumstances - she ended up in a very difficult situation in the end of the previous book. She looks good, if somewhat masochistic. You know about enduring punishment until they became tired of giving it? This is her approach.This is the last book Robert Jordan wrote before his untimely death. We lost one of the best world-builder surpassed only by J.R.R. Tolkien. I am still sad about him not being able to finish his series as well as never starting on another one he planned for a long time.Dear Mr. Jordan, the fantasy genre had a great loss with your passing. Thank you for a wonderful journey in the world which really feels alive with different people with different cultures; the world full of mysteries, magic, lost knowledge, and strange ruins and artifacts, the world full of violence but still remaining bright and optimistic.

But, if you've made it this far, perhaps that won't bug you.I have to say that Robert Jordan can surely set a scene; indeed, each chapter begins with a very detailed description of the setting, including such minutia as the style and oiliness of men's beards, the height of ladies' boots, every knickknack on every plinth, every bit of jewelry worn by each character, how much bosom is exposed, how tight the pants are, etc. The reader certainly feels immersed in the setting, but for those who have other books they hope to read this year, this may be aggravating.By this point in the series, I can no longer keep track of the characters. In the chapters about Elayne, we find Pelivar, high seat of House Coelan, and Perival, high seat of house Mantear. Ack!! And here are the names of the characters whose names begin with \"An\": Anaiya, Anaiyella, Ananda, Anath, Andaya Forae, Andaya Murasaka, Ander Corl, Ander Tol, Andhilin, Andil, Andra, Andric, Andris, Andro, Androl Genhald, Mistress Andscale, Anemara, Mistress Anford, Anghar, Angla, Anjen, Ankaer, Anlee, Annharid, Annoura Larisen, Anthelle Sharplyn, Antol, Anvaere, Anya. You'll find a list like this for every letter of the alphabet (see them at Encyclopaedia WOT. Did he expect us to study? I feel like I need flashcards.Again, there's so much stuff in Knife of Dreams that we've already heard before: eyes a man could drown in, rosebud mouth, seductive copper-skinned domani, Aes Sedai don't show emotions (but they do), Loial sounds like a bumblebee, damp bowstrings don't work, arms folded beneath breasts, unnecessary adjustment of clothes, smiles that don't touch eyes, Mat worries about his men's influences on Olver (wink, wink -- yeah, we got it already!). I could go on and on and on. And don't even get me started on the spanking. There was more spanking in Knife of Dreams than any of the previous novels. Why are adults spanking each other?? (It's not for fun.) I rolled my eyes so often, I started to worry they'd stick.There was one major redeeming factor here, though, and that's that the plot actually moves forward in Knife of Dreams. There are some big events that occur (each surrounded by a lot of fluff). I got the impression that after the last book (in which nothing happened for 900 pages), Mr Jordan woke up and said \"oh, Light! Tarmon Gai'don's got to happen in the next book and I've got to get everyone there and on the same side!\" And so we see that starting to happen -- alliances are being made, people are getting in position. In fact, some of it happens much too quickly and easily to be believed (e.g., Egwene's storyline, Whitecloak storyline). But that's fine with me -- let's get this over with.Since Knife of Dreams was Robert Jordan's last book published before his death, let me say that I have enjoyed the world, the story, and the characters he created -- The Wheel of Time is truly epic and I respect Mr Jordan's work. My complaint is that it became aggravatingly slow and repetitive for the last several novels. But I eagerly look forward to finding out how it all ends.You're up, Mr Sanderson!!Read more Robert Jordan book reviews at Fantasy literature."}, {"userName": "JDR", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24299015-jdr", "userReview": "So, before anything else. First things first, YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!! WE ARE OUT OF THE SLUMP!!!!!!!!PRAISE THE LORD, THE BOOK DID ITI DIDN'T KNOW IT WOULD FEEL SO GOODBUT IT FELT EVEN BETTER THAN IT WAS POSSIBLE TO IMAGINE, I HAVE COME OUTTA THE OTHER SIDE STILL ALIVE The sweetness of victory and the bitterness of defeat are alike a knife of dreams  All right, let us get down to it. Take a few deep breaths before I begin and waste a few characters on how shocked I am. The feeling that can be used to described this doesn't exist, but I will say a little anecdote. Since I am now commencing the B.S Trilogy, I am also approaching the end of the series. Now, I am much closer to the internet boom times so there are plenty of videos and articles concerning the last books. One of these articles is called \"A Memory of Light delivers a better ending than Robert Jordan deserves\". Now, this does not relate with this installment, but it does well in summarizing how I feel concerning this specific book. I was so messed up during the Slump Saga, just look at my Crossroads of Twilight and Winter's Heart reviews. Yet, this book turned it around from page 1. Knife of Dreams has also broken my personal record on how many notes I have written, which take up 68 lines. I haven't felt this good on a book since the first five in this series, but how well do I really like this installment? So, let's begin and discover the answer to what will definitely be a long review. 1. Fast-Pacing.  Do you remember the first five books? Do you remember when things occurred in the span of 600-800 pages and as you closed the book thought how it was satisfying? Because this one does too thanks to its fast pacing and the cutting of tons of fluff. Although there are 50 pages of Elayne POV that could have certainly been cut it out in the 250-300 area, but the first 250 pages, PURE GOLD. 300 onward, PURE GOLD. There is infinitely less filler than in previous books. It makes me feel as though those damn editors finally sat down and decided to advise RJ what they should advised a while back, but now decided enough was enough. There was never a point, unlike in the Slump Saga, where I felt like skipping a chapter. Always did I find myself engrossed and amused or tense and excited. So, thank jesus. 2. The Prologue was good enough to give orgasms.  Yes, you did read right. A problem that occurred often enough in nearly every book before this except the first five books, since they were short, was that they were too long and too boring. It felt perfectly fine to skip a tenth of the book because all of the useless POVs would be shoved into the prologue. Here, the prologue was 97 pages and believe me, my first thoughts were \"Oh great, yet again I must go through this bullshit\". However, the book began with a bang with Galad VS Eamon Valda. But, don't think that immediately sold me. No, it was the fact that the POV was 13 pages, quick and cleanly written slice of greatness. For the first time ever, a Galad POV was engaging. Then, we saw an Ituralde POV and I know what that would make you think, \"Oh hell no, that dude from the Crossroads of Twilight POV, why!!!?\" However, again, RJ comes on with that bitch slap in the face and shows how Ituralde is an  excellent  and  intelligent  general. We are shown this in again, a quick and clean slice of greatness, where he takes out a score of Seachan. Now, Ituralde has been developed into this awesome Domani general. After, Suroth POV where we are revealed she's Darkfriend and developed on Ituralde through her perspective. Also, SEMIRHAGE! Also, THE EMPIRE IS DESTROYED! Then, Tower POVs which before would make me cringe and think \"DAMMIT!\" But no, development and insight into how broken the White Tower is. People are afraid of being assaulted or roaming the halls in fear of other ajahs, by other  sisters . That is so messed up! Then Perrin and Egwene POVs further develop their situations which will be expanded upon in their sections. Overall, maybe the best Prologue in the series to date. 3. Quick Side notes.  At this point, some thoughts were how surprised I was that Berelain is a significant part of Perrin's POV and just in general, how she is still around. She has grown much since the beginning of Shadow Rising. Next, the possibility that there won't be that many new storylines by useless characters. It's possibly safe to say that era has ended. Also, the Sea Folk commit mass suicide! WTF! When they said at the end of Winter's Heart that the age of Illusions had come to an end, I did not expect that would be the result. Finally, Tam al'Thor cameo which is always nice to see. We finally see him discover that Rand is the Dragon Reborn. 4. Elayne's POV.  Now, her POV wasn't bad but neither was it particularly great. It is definitely a significant improvement since previous installments, but there is still very little to make Elayne that much of an interesting character. I mean, I don't really care what happens to her. The Civil war storyline was a good storyline to use, but it just wasn't that juicy either. That's sort of a problem with her character in general, she has very much with Aviendha and Birgitte, sort of lost significance to me personally. \"Stone cracks from a hard enough blow,\" Cadsuane said, her face an Aes Sedai mask of calm, \"Steel shatters. The oak fights the wind and breaks. The willow bends where it musts and survives.\"\"A willow won't win Tarmon Gai'don,\" Rand told her. (Chapter 18, News for the Dragon)  5. Rand POV.  The worst and the greatest is yet to come for Rand from what I presume and from what I have heard. His storyline doesn't close the book as was usual and neither does it lead the book. Rand is present and besides the battle at the manor, with the excellent Chapter 19 where we see Loial do....great stuff. Overall, he had a good enough presence in the book, but this certainly wasn't the Rand Book as it usually is. However, the following is a good paragraph from a Rand POV.  \"You must be in shock,\" Nynaeve said slowly. \"You've just suffered a grievous injury. Rand. Maybe you'd better lie down. LordDavram, have one your men bring a saddle to put his feet up.\"\"He's not in shock,' Min said sadly. The bond was full of sadness. She had taken hold of his arm as if to hold him up again. \"He lost ahand, but there's nothing to do about it. so he's left it behind already.\"\"Wool-headed fool.' Nynaeve muttered. Her hand, still smeared with Sandomere's blood, drifted toward the thick braid hanging overher shoulder, but she yanked it back down. \"You've been hurt badly. It's all right to grieve. It's all right to feel stunned. It's normal!\"\"I don't have time,\" he told her. Min's sadness threatened to overflow the bond. Light, he was all right! Why did she feel so sad?\" (Chapter 27, A Plain Wooden Box)  6. Perrin POV  Oh Perrin, how low you have fallen! You used to have interesting POVs, but now he is merely a step above Elayne. He just doesn't hold that much interest. Finally, he has regained custody of Faile, odd way of saying that. Takes out a lot of the Shaido, and the Shaido run away. \"I'll mark you down for midday again, since I know you have no intention ofcurtsying.\" The faintest hint of resignation tinged her voice.   7. Egwene POV.  EGWENE!!! Never before have I loved this character as much as I do now. In the span of 40 pages, in the greatest chapter of the book and one of the best in the whole series, she goes from Elayne level to Rand level. The brilliance of Chapter 24 is multiple factors. We see the White Tower on sight and how messed it is. Also, we see characters establishing their relationship with Egwene. Then the brilliance kicks in. In the span of 40 pages, we see the White Tower first-hand, Egwene is treated like shit by other novices, by Accepted and Aes Sedai, and she is taking for penance multiple times a day. Simultaneously, we see her refuse to be broken, resilient in pursuing her plans, she acts out and refuses to be treated like dog shit. Not only is Egwene a strong character in terms of sheer power in Saidar, she is a strong enough character to where her presence and demeanor is as strong if not stronger than Siuan Sanche at the beginning of the series. We see her at her prime, and the best part is seeing the rise and fall of others' hostility. By the end of the chapter, Egwene has made a traitor submit and ask for forgiveness and set her plans in motion, we see Egwene's two Aes Sedai guards gain a sort of respect for her, and the other novices hold her in awe. In fact, the other novices go to her for advice on how to go about certain things or help on how to weave something. She is winning the war, even in her own imprisonment. Comparing Elaida and herself, she spreads seeds of doubt among the tower's residents and makes herself set out more as the True Amyrlin Seat. \"I think I'll keep this as a memento,\" he said, rolling the fat gold coin across the back of his fingers.\"To remind me that even the luckiest man in the world can lose.\"  8. Mat POV.  Without a doubt, this book is Egwene and Mat's book, leaning more on Mat. He spanks Joline and he discovers that Moiraine is still alive. Also that he, Thom, and one another are the ones who will save her. Likely, in Towers of Midnight. Although I was surprised that the letter to Thom was ALL about Mat. Besides, We see his relationship with Tuon develop and by the end of the installment, Mat is officially married! Tuon reminisces on the fact that Mat is in love with her and wonders if she herself can ever be in love. So, that says that there is still a ways to go before the relationship storyline can be wholly done with them parting ways, but still as spouses. Also, funny how he is technically a noble now even though he has time and time again said how he resents them. \"What do you make of him?\" she asked Karede once they were away from the soldiers and beginning to canter. There was no need tosay which \"he\" she meant.\"It is not my place to make judgments, High Lady,\" he said gravely. His head swivelled, keeping watch on the surrounding trees. \"Iserve the Empire and the Empress, may she live forever.\"\"As do we all, Banner-General. But I ask your judgment.\"\"A good general. High Lady,\" he replied without hesitation. \"Brave, but not overly brave. He won't get himself killed just to show howbrave he is, I think. And he is . . . adaptable. A man of many layers. And if you will forgive me, High Lady, a man in love with you. Isaw how he looked at you.\"In love with her? Perhaps. She thought she might be able to come to love him. Her mother had loved her father, it was said. And aman of many layers?  9. This book does capitalize on Mat's development as a character. In fact, it capitalizes on everyone's characters.  Partially, this book really serves to make one reflect on how far we have come. Rand is a stone, the Dragon Reborn, and not the boy who conflicted with Moiraine when they left the Two Rivers; hell, he isn't the boy who made Moiraine be his lap dog in The Fires of Heaven. Mat isn't the complete goofball who was in denial and acted like a complete dumbass back in the first 6 books; he has found his groove, he is the general of the Band of the Red Hand, but from duty. Mat has gained their respect as a general, not through force, but by his victories and actions and he still strives to not have to deal with war and to find peace and solace. Perrin is not the totally peaceful boy, he is a wolf in manshape, he does what he has to do, no matter what. He is suspicious, he has plans, he has goals, and he has ways of getting there, but he has also made mistakes, as with Aram. Egwene isn't the girl who left Two Rivers, she is the Amyrlin Seat, she is unbreakable and she has a vision, she is powerful in saidar and in presence. Those are some examples of how far we have come. *SIDE NOTE: Mazrim Taim. Who the hell is he really? He says that cryptic phrase \"Let the Lord of Chaos Rule\" which I think Demandred says. Hmmmmm....In conclusion, Knife of Dreams is a perfect way for RJ to go. Thank him for all he has done and the world he has created as well as giving me a huge bitch slap in the face yet again and proving to me, making me remember, the brilliance in his writing and the pure skill of his storytelling.

Seems like he was ready to get down to business finally. No matter what you think of him as a writer, I don't think anyone can deny that it was a tragedy for him to die before he could finish out this thing that he'd been working on for so long, and so close to the end. I hope he knew his story had been left in safe hands (his widow\u2014who was also his longtime editor\u2014picked Brandon Sanderson to finish it out from his notes, but I believe she might have made that decision after RJ had already died; feel free to correct me if I'm wrong about that). So after much waffling about, most egregiously in book ten, Crossroads of Twilight (a book in which absolutely nothing of import occurs), things finally start to happen. Rand doesn't get much showcase here (you know, most of the time, I feel like Jordan really didn't know what to do with rand as a character), but he's trying to make an alliance with the Seanchan happen, and ends up having a confrontation with one of the Forsaken instead. Egwene finally gets here due. I have to tell you, her storyline is the most excited and emotionally engaged I've been in this series since probably about book five. I don't even normally like Aes Sedai machinations, but I loved seeing her insinuate herself into the White Tower as their prisoner all the while refusing to stop viewing herself as the true Amyrlin, and gaining the trust and respect of the sisters in the Tower bit by bit, eroding Elaida's base of power. But she really only gets a couple of chapters. This is Mat's book (and unfortunately, Perrin's; the less said about the ending of that endless storyline he's been mired in the better).Mat is leading a group in escape from Ebou Dar, and he's got his future bride Tuon in tow, the Daughter of the Nine Moons aka the heir to the Seanchan Empire. Both of them know the other will be their spouse, because prophecy, but neither is aware that the other knows. Once I accepted that theirs was going to be yet another romance built on the foundations of antagonism, I found their storyline entertaining. I thought Mat acquitted himself well, although I still wish Jordan would stop with all the gender essentialism. Mat especially has a tendency to lump all women into categories as if they are a different species. And I simultaneously like and dislike Tuon. I enjoy her playful attitude, but I abhor her self-entitled attitude, and her blind insistence on her culture's deplorable traditions (particularly the ones based on enslaving people in various ways, and dehumanizing them). I also hated the way she tried to play games with Mat. Her goal was to maneuver him, not fall in love with him, whereas he's basically head over heels for her at this point, the poor guy. It was satisfying watching him upend her assumptions about him as a person, but I'm really ready for her to get a couple of comeuppances before I can fully like her.I still have the same problems with this series that I always have (see my other reviews for this series if you want more details; I really don't feel like going into them all again here). But I was so relieved to be feeling positive emotions again relating to this series while reading Knife of Dreams that I think a lot of my critical brain just went offline for a while. It's taken me three years to get this far in the series, and I'm so glad to have made it this far, even if large portions of my reading experience have been frustrating. I've actually been reading a lot of Wheel of Time content online from major fans of the series, and while my experience is definitely not theirs, I still find it really enjoyable to see people talking so passionately and intelligently about WOT. Tor.com particularly has a lot of good coverage, including multiple re-reads written by Leigh Butler, and a first-time reader's experience that just started up last month, written by Kelsey Jefferson Bennett.But I will not lie when I say I am mostly excited to have gotten this far because I can't wait to see what Brandon Sanderson can do with this story and these characters, as I've historically responded really well to his whole thing as an author."}, {"userName": "Brahm", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/77778-brahm", "userReview": "Knife of Dreams, the elenth book in the colossal fantasy series the Wheel of Time, has been viewed as something of a return for Robert Jordan. After near unanimous agreement on the terrible quality of books 8-10 (and particularly book 10, Crossroads of Twilight, an 800 page novel where literally nothing happens), fans (and some critics) have regarded this as a return to form. Are they right? Is Knife of Dreams really as good as such earlier volumes as The Dragon Reborn and Lord of Chaos? Has it redeemed the series? While it certainly marks an improvement, I would argue that A Knife of Dreams is a simply mediocre effort and nowhere near on par with the earlier books in the series.The key thing that fans seem to be praising about this novel is its pace; and indeed, the fact that Jordan resolves plotlines that have been festering away for as many as three or four 800 page novels is a welcome change. However, there is no question that this book is overlong, and that Jordan still maintains the overdescriptive writing style that has destroyed this series' enjoyability. Jordan spends (as usual) way too much time describing the clothing of all the characters we meet, and, more damningly, takes up too much page space with unimportant plotlines. The worst example of this is Elayne; far too much time is spent with such an uninteresting character, and Jordan's political machinations are both shallow and boring. Sections like Elayne's, and those of minor charactors whose names you won't remember and who won't have any effect on the actual major plot, bring the pace of the book down quite a lot and make it, at points, a plodding experience.And although several plotlines are resolved in this book, I can't say that Jordan does it all too well. After spending three agonizing books watching Perrin plot to rescue his wife, a 15 page battle in which this is finally done is incredibly anti-climactic and proves that Jordan really just had no idea where to go with the plot. Any attempt to tie threads like this in with the overall plot are absent, showing that Jordan just needed somewhere convenient for his characters to be while Rand takes his time getting ready for the last battle. Similarly, when something dramatic finally happens in Rand's POV (and I'm not talking about a certain incredibly dumb battle which pits Rand against a large number of foes), it is written so clumsily and is over so quickly that you feel as if Jordan is just writing these scenes so that he can placate the fans and get back to his love of dress description.Now, on the positive side, the pace has increased, despite my complaints, and anyone whose read Crossroads of Twilight will be thankful for that. Although nearly all the women in the series essentially remain one note characters with no likeable or interesting character traits, Egwene finally does becomes somehwat likeable after ten books, though her plotline is annoying left with not even a cliffhanger. Similarly, Nynaeve has a touching moment here, words I certainly never thought I'd hear (well, read) myself saying (typing). And of course, even while nothing of import happens in his plotline (until the very end), Mat can still, fortunately, entertain you.Despite all these problems, there is a more serious issue that has been present in this series since book seven: Namely, when's it going to end? Although Jordan has began resolving plotlines, he has also introduced several in this book. He promises to only deliver one more book, yet, without rushing the action even more, I find that its simply impossible to resolve all these plotlines within one book. On the other hand, I am really getting fed up with this never ending story, and I want nothing more than for it to finally reach some resolution. It'll be interesting to see if he can worm his way out of this with the next (and possibly last) book of the Wheel of Time, A Memory of Light."}, {"userName": "Jon", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/899665-jon", "userReview": "3 stars"}, {"userName": "Emma Deplores Goodreads Censorship", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship", "userReview": "First of all, I'd like to clear up the misconception that the series is meant to be read all at once and even the terrible books are decent if you're not waiting a couple years for each one. I started reading the Wheel of Time in 2003, and for the first six books I ran out to get the sequel as soon as I finished the one before it. Well, then the books started to slow down, and I lost interest... finally, I realized I could skip #9-10 entirely, read online summaries, and continue to Knife of Dreams. While I re-engaged enough to continue for a bit, my experience is proof that having them all (well, the first 10 anyway) available at once doesn't solve Jordan's problems. Of course the wait time contributes to the irritation readers feel, but it doesn't cloud their judgment; the bad books are bad, whether you have to wait in between or not. Unfortunately, I would put Knife of Dreams into that category, although it is an improvement over, say, Path of Daggers. It is mildly entertaining. It's certainly readable. Occasionally things happen, although of course the book is divided between five major subplots (Rand, Mat, Perrin, Egwene, and Elayne, or six if you count Faile), interspersed with some minor ones as well, and so while they may resolve their private conflicts, it remains unclear why, say, Faile's capture and rescue or Elayne's gaining the Lion Throne is important in the great scheme of the series. Like in the previous tomes, scenes containing action are countered by the continuing focus on irrelevant power struggles between irrelevant female characters, complete with skirt-smoothing (elevated by Jordan to an infallible barometer of female agitation), arm-crossing (always \"beneath her breasts\" as if we were confused about where these crossed arms were going, above her head maybe) and spanking, of all things. The sad truth is that Jordan can't write political intrigue no matter how hard he tries. His strength is in action-adventure, which drew all of us in to the series in the first place but is sadly lacking here. Now let me add my voice to the chorus expressing disgust for Jordan's portrayal of women. They are all the same person, and not a likeable one at that. All she (meaning every woman in the book) seems to care about is garnering power and deference from others, and therefore every woman in the book spends most of her time trying to one-up every other woman in the book. Healthy relationships, among women or between men and women, are nonexistent (Elayne and Aviendha are as close as it gets, so of course Jordan separates them); instead we get \"I care about this person, but he/she is so hard to deal with!\" Endlessly. I'm beginning to suspect that Jordan actually created a matriarchal-type society to express his views on why (in his opinion) women are catty and incompetent and men should rule all. Not that his men do much better, of course, but at least they don't smooth their skirts. Then there is the continuing shallowness of all scenes featuring our supposed villains. I've come to dread these, because they boil down to one of two scenes: A) A baddie kowtows to a higher-ranking baddie, who in turn kowtows to an even higher-ranking one, and so forth up the line, with all conversations consisting of \"Obey me or else!\" \"Y-y-yes, Master/Mistress. . . .\" or B) A group of baddies gets together, apparently to plot or give progress reports, but it boils down to abovementioned one-upmanship, without having any effect on the plot. And the circus that seems to be going on inside the main characters' heads. I've read a fair bit of fantasy, and am used to telepathic communication and the like. But Jordan overdoes it. Let's take a look at Rand's head, for instance. First there's the insane Lews Therin (and another guy). Then there's the matter with seeing Mat and Perrin whenever he thinks about them (all three try to push these visions away rather than using them for anything useful). And then he's formed a partial mind-meld with FOUR different women. He and Min are now having bizarre interactions in which they don't say or do anything, just sort of toss emotions back and forth. Then of course there's Mat with his dice and other people's memories, and Perrin and his wolves and his constant, irritating \"sniffing\" of people's emotions. Any one of these elements would be standard for fantasy; ALL of them is overdone. We can't relate. Despite that whole mess, though (and numerous other weaknesses other reviewers have remarked on, and I will refrain from repeating), the book is worth reading if you're planning to see this epic through. Do what I did--skip #10 (maybe #8 or #9 as well), and get #11 from the library. In the meanwhile, read some GRR Martin and find out what REAL political intrigue looks like."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3344685-sarah", "userReview": "Finally a book comes along that has restored my faith in the Wheel of Time series! The first four books were absolutely brilliant but I think anyone will agree that the series went a bit haywire after that, Robert Jordan kept introducing more and more points of view and random plot threads that just never seemed to go anywhere. The stories went from being 1000 pages of pretty much non stop awesomeness to being 600 pages of boring description with about 200 pages of actual plot development and I'd considered quitting the series many times. It's only the fact that I've been buddy reading the series that pulled me through, that and the fact that I've now read over 9000 pages in this world (which is a LOT of reading hours!) and I'm rather invested in the characters by this point!Anyway, all is almost forgiven because Knife of Dreams reminded me how much I loved the earlier books (and it also proved that the most recent offerings just couldn't compete). I'm sad that this is the last book Robert Jordan was able to finish before he died and I'm a little nervous about Brandon Sanderson taking over the series for the remaining three books. I'm going to hope that he was able to create a fitting end to the series though and the fact that he had Robert Jordan's blessing and used his notes to help him makes me think we'll at least get to see the ending Robert Jordan was aiming for.So what was so great about Knife of Dreams? Well we finally start to get some resolution to things that have been plodding along at a snail's pace for ages now. Perrin finally has a chance to rescue Faile, Rand takes on another of the forsaken, Mat and Tuon's courtship gets even more confusing for him, Nynaeve outwits Lan in a moment of utter brilliance, Egwene shows the world her backbone and totally earned my respect, we finally find out what Moiriane's letter to Thom was all about (and it's going to lead to something fantastic!) and Loial's family finally catch up with him. I think the only chapters I didn't enjoy were the ones about Elayne, she's annoyed me for a long time now but I got so fed up of hearing about her pregnancy mood swings. I also hated the way she constantly puts herself into dangerous situations using Min's visions of the babies being born healthy as proof that nothing bad can possibly happen to her. I'd actually quite like to see her made to suffer for that but luckily for her Birgitte is always on hand to save the day. Aviendha has been stuck on the sidelines for several books now so I'm actually glad to see her being removed from Elayne for a bit and hope that means she'll be given a chance to shine again. I still think the weird love square would be much better off as two separate couples. Min and Rand fit together perfectly while Elayne and Aviendha are far more upset about leaving each other than they ever have been about parting from Rand.Anyway, Knife of Dream left me excited about the Wheel of Time series for the first time in ages and I'm looking forward to seeing how Brandon Sanderson does at pulling all the different threads together ready for the big finale.______________________Buddy read with Buddies, Books & Baubles starting 1st November 2016"}, {"userName": "Phrynne", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne", "userReview": "Over 30 hours of audiobook entertainment.

There were parts that were really slow but there were also some really good parts especially when they featured Rand or Matt. This seems to be the norm with these books though. For some reason despite their frequent lack of action and repetitive qualities they have something which drags the reader in and makes them want to carry on - and on - and on.

This book felt like a return to form for Mr. Jordan. Sadly it was his last.Audiobook: Another fantastic job from Michael Kramer and Kate Reading. They really make this world come alive and have always made the slower parts of the series pass by much easier.\nFull Review\nI remember really enjoying this book on my first read. I enjoyed it just as much on my second. By this point in the series Mat was by far my favorite character. This book is a lot of Mat. This time around I still enjoyed his parts the best. We also probably get one of my favorite revelations of the series during his chapters.Tuon is an interesting character, but I don't think I appreciated how horrible she actually is. Her actions towards slavery and particularly the way women who can channel are treated like animals is appalling. Yet despite all that, I still find her parts particularly enjoyable. I'm not sure how to resolve those conflicting feelings with each other.We also finally get some resolution to one of my least favorite subplots. Perrin used to be my favorite, but for the last several books his chapters have been frustrating. Now things can move on, and if I remember correctly, I enjoyed the rest of his story much more than the middle parts.Nynaeve had a relatively small part in this book, but what she did is yet another reason that despite all the braid tugging and skirt straightening that she became one of my favorites of the series.The stuff with Rand has also gotten much better and a few of the most interesting chapters in the book belong to him.Egwene's chapters are probably my favorite after Mat's. In the last few books she was starting to really come into her own, and her circumstances in this book let her really shine on her own. Elaine on the other hand I found a bit of a struggle to read. It seemed as though her story was dragged out a bit too much. Things are finally moving along by the end of the book however.The last few books seemed to be a lot of moving pieces around, and this book seems to finally be moving things along. It really is the beginning of the end of the series, and sadly the last complete book we got from Mr. Jordan. This series gets a lot of (deserved) criticism for it's length, but I feel like with this book we were finally getting the quality of those first few books that made me fall in love with the series in the first place.It's a shame he didn't get to finish it on his own, but as a rather biased Brandon Sanderson fan, I hope Mr. Jordan would be content with how the rest of the series turned out.

I had heard before going into this one that it's the beginning of Jordan bringing all the threads back together in order to compose the final instalment (A Memory of Light) after this one (which would have made a 12 book series) but in actuality when Sanderson took over after this it ended up that he and Jordan's wife agreed splitting the final book into 3 books would be for the best otherwise it would be gigantic.I do certainly think that this book does show the beginning of Jordan's attempts to contain and draw in the series. Some of the problems and situations our characters have been facing are resolved at long last (some of which I wish had been resolved a little quicker! We all know which two characters I am talking about!) and we do see a lot of political agreements, alliances and shifts being formed which will all no doubt contribute to the Final Battle.I found that in this book Elayne and Matt were probably my favourite two storylines because of how they were more prominent and exciting. The situation with Elayne trying to reclaim her status and gather support has been ongoing for a while now and seeing some of these supporters questioned and resolved (either for or against her) made me very happy. I also loved hearing about the way that she's progressing with her own internal struggles and seeing the way that this change had affected the way she approached scary situations and intimidating people.As for Matt I think his story in this book certainly interested me most because of how much focus we had on him as a character for once and the way that he seemed to be actually taking a role in the world once more and the ongoing problems following him. It seemed as though Matt had accepted his fate and was, although not exactly embracing it, content to see it through and discover what his future might hold and who may be a big part of it.Faile and Perrin's storylines were the ones which have been irritating me the most since they were separated due to unforeseen events. They have each been struggling to get themselves out of the situations they've been sucked into and there's been a lot of fixation on them despite an often disconnect between them and the rest of the world. I was very happy to see some of the problems between them and their situations come to a close and seeing Faile overcome her pettiness somewhat was certainly refreshing. Perrin seemed to come into his own more once the problems were facing him head on and he was near to his goal, which meant that I could read about him and admire his determination, not be irritated by his lack of action and constant moans.Egwene was also a fantastic character at some points of this book despite being in her own predicament. When she walked into her situation without planning in book #11 I was somewhat worried at what might become of her and what she may be reduced to, but she remained every bit herself and dignified throughout her ordeal. I love her and admire her, and I think she's certainly one of the much more interesting female characters within this book and the series as a whole. I cannot wait to see what she does next because she's so resilient and strong.On the whole, although Rand is usually the central character, I felt that this book focused more on some of the others which was nice to bring their storylines a bit up to date with his own. I have a feeling that the next three books will have a different tone to them with Sanderson in charge, and hopefully the various plentiful threads will be all tied together in them to make a superb ending for the series!"}, {"userName": "OhWell", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12909193-ohwell", "userReview": "[I came to hate Perrin and Faile with a passion!

With the series dragging plotlines that it did not need on to ridiculous length, subplots bogging down all forward momentum, and most of the fast paced action from the first five books utterly absent for so long that many fans of the series had forgotten there could be such a thing in a Wheel of Time book, Jordan finally pulled the series out of its rut, and set it back on it's path to the inevitable conclusion. All of the side stories that most people found to be so objectionable in the previous three books came to an end in spectacular fashion, and the entire book has a deep feeling of time running out, events crashing toward a conclusion, and of a world on the edge of destruction. This was the book Wheel of Time fans had been waiting for since Lord of Chaos, where the story FINALLY got moving again, and everything began to tie up. For the first time we had a faint glimmer that the end of this series was in sight. It was the return to form that we had all been awaiting for nearly a decade, and it did not disappoint.The world is falling apart. Despite recent victories over it, the Shadow threatens to engulf everything. The Pattern itself seems to be unraveling, allowing people and places long since gone from the world to walk it once more. Wards are failing. Food spoils far too quickly. Rats and ravens, eyes of the Dark One, are everywhere. And much of the world is still at war.Perrin makes a deal with the Seanchan in order to decimate the Shaido Aiel and take his wife back. Holding his fractous army together by sheer strength of will and determination to see Faile once more, he pushes onward, dealing with the Dark One, as he puts it, to see the deed done.Elayne secures her throne, though I'm not entirely sure how she managed to do it, or that she even deserves it. She displays quite a bit of stupidity, getting herself captured as a result and sending hundreds of men to their deaths in a rescue attempt. The men who gave their lives for her freedom deserve far better than she, in my opinion, and she can't even be bothered to feel the slightest bit guilty over it. And worst of all Elayne does not learn a SINGLE thing from this mistake and makes the EXACT same one the next time we see her.Rand comes to the realization that he cannot fight the Last Battle with the Seanchan at his back, and believes that the only way he can win is to make a truce with them. However, the peace talks explode when the supposed Daughter of the Nine Moons turns out to be Semirhage in disguise.After discovering that the entire Seanchan army is after Tuon as an imposter, Mat rejoins his army and starts a war unlike any the Seanchan have ever seen to get her to safety.All that is, all that was, and all that ever shall be may yet fall under the Shadow. The Last Battle is coming. The world is not ready for it. And Rand al'Thor, the only hope of victory, is sinking deeper and deeper into darkness and insanity.The Good? FINALLY!!! FREAKING FINALLY!!! Elayne's, Perrin's, and Mat's storylines that have bogged the series down over the last three books come to an end. These are three storylines that I felt were unnecessarily dragged out to ridiculous lengths for no real reason, and it basically ground the ENTIRE series to a complete halt. Each and every one of them comes to an explosive conclusion that is all the better for having had to wait so long for it. After all of the build up, it was great to finally see a pay off on these storylines. The fast paced action of the earlier books in the series returns in full force. All of the politics bogging down the previous several volumes take a back seat to the resolution of these three storylines, as the gears of the series finally start turning again, and some much needed focus returns.For the first time since this series began, there is an ending in sight. This book is the one that I like to think of as the beginning of the end. The mood and tone of this book so perfectly convey a sense of everything being on the brink of destruction with time fast running out. You can FEEL the headlong rush into the Last Battle like an avalanche rumbling through the ground if not actually seen quite yet. Things seem so hopeless for our heroes. They're out matched in every way imaginable, and their Chosen One, is insane and lost in the despair of his position. At this point it seems as though his defeat at the last battle is inevitable. He's given up all hope of surviving, and in fact welcomes the idea of death. When I finished this book, I honestly could not see any way that Rand could overcome everything that's against him. He's fallen so far, and has so far left to go that I just didn't see how he could possibly prevail. The feeling of hopelessness that permeates this book is so excellently played that you would swear that the author meant for him to fail. And it's GREAT. It is spectacularly done, making this one of my favorite books in the series.Rand, Perrin, and Mat, the three original heroes of the story all go through some very good character development in this book, showing how far they've come since the beginning, and how far yet they have to go before they can pull things together and turn their headlong rush toward defeat into a victory. This entire book is a study in how to bring your characters to the brink of destruction before they finally overcome, and that they sink even deeper in the next two books only to come out on top as a pay off for it makes this book, as the catalyst for those changes, all the better now. In this book Robert Jordan reminds all of his faithful fans why it is that we're still reading the series, and it was all we could have asked for and more.The Ugly? Elayne. Dear God do I hate this character. Her insistence that she's indestructible because Min saw that she would give birth to two babies gets her into ridiculous amounts of trouble. Her faith that she will come out the other side completely unscathed displays her arrogance and stupidity in full force, getting hundreds of people killed in the process, including several Aes Sedai, and their warders, not to mention her own armsmen, who have pledged their lives to protect hers. She is a selfish child who cannot be bothered to think of the consequences of her actions, and of how much blood will be spilled because of them. And people wonder why I hate her so much. All you need do is read this book and you will know why. She has not learned from a single one of her past mistakes, continuing to make them over, and over, and over again. When she offers the throne to another, we are treated to one of the biggest loads of BS ever put to paper when this character replies with how much more suited to the throne, and to ruling a nation Elayne is. Let me remind you that this is immediately following one of the stupidest things that Elayne has ever done in her life, resulting in hundreds dead, a thousand maimed or otherwise wounded, and several Aes Sedai dead. WHAT!?!? On what world does this even begin to prove how much a better ruler Elayne will be? That characters who have previously shown themselves to be intelligent continually praise her utter stupidity and lack of anything resembling common sense as bravery and sharp wit really grates on me. It feels so contrived because the plot needs them to say it, but these are things that these characters really would not and should not be thinking and saying. It really feels like a case of the author needed something to happen regardless of how the characters would react to it so none of them are true to themselves in order for it to happen. Elayne is not only one of the stupidest figures in all of fiction, but she makes everyone around her stupider by osmosis. She has lost each and every restraining influence on her save for Birgitte, and frankly, the woman proves herself not up to the task of babysitting utter dumbasses who have been raised since the cradle to believe that the entire world will bow before them. Birgitte just needs to lock herself in a closet with the girl and slap her silly until some of the stupid falls out, but she refuses to do it because Elayne saved her life.In conclusion, this book was excellent. It makes extraordinary use of mood and tone to create an atmosphere of hopelessness, and a sense of things coming to an end. After quite a few volumes of really nothing happening, and no forward motion in the overall plot of the series, things finally begin moving forward toward an ending that is finally within sight. A lot of the superfluous storylines that had been dragged out FAR longer than they should have come to an end, and a lot of the characters go through some very good development. The one dark spot of this book is Elayne and her utter stupidity and selfishness. I felt that it was offensive enough to knock a star off of the rating, and so I can only give this book four stars. This book was a return to form for the series, and got the gears turning once more, bringing some much needed action and forward motion to a story that had been stagnating in political maneuvering for almost a decade. As the last book written by an extraordinary author before his death, it reminds me what we all lost with his passing. Almost every aspect of this book was a beautiful display of excellent writing and storytelling, giving epic payoffs for all of our patience in sticking with it to this point. Thank you, Mister Jordan, for giving us such a great series. I hope that wherever you may be now, you have found peace and relief from the disease that ended your life. It's strange to say, but these books have changed my life, influencing me deeply over the last twenty years. When he died it felt as though one of my best friends had passed away. However, he has left us such a legacy in The Wheel of Time, that his name may live on forever, or until the Wheel turns and a new age begins, leaving memories that become legend. Legend that fades to myth, and so on and so forth.

If I\u2019d stopped reading halfway through, I would have given this one star. About midway, though, it suddenly picked up and became a page turner. The usual cast of characters is here, more or less: Mat and Perrin (and Faile) seem largely wasted, as their chapters consist of page after page after page of strategizing. Nynave and Lan barely appear in this book, which isn\u2019t such a bad thing. Neither do Min or Aviendha, which is. Thom is likewise sidelined, serving largely as a supporting character to Mat. Elayne has a substantial number of pages devoted to her plight, but for the most part absolutely nothing happens. When something did finally happen, I\u2019m afraid I rolled my eyes in disbelief. Also, I\u2019m reasonably sure that pregnant women aren\u2019t filled with rage every minute of every day but, having never been pregnant, perhaps I\u2019m wrong. Egwene, on the other hand, has an incredibly compelling storyline in this book and has become (I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this) perhaps my favorite character. Rand is also pretty interesting and takes part in a crazy battle that really shocked me. Lews has definitely overstayed his welcome though.

I was half hoping that the prequel (New Spring) that focused on Moiraine might have been a hint that her story would finally come back up in book 11. I thought maybe Jordan wrote a book focusing on her to bring her back to the interest of his readers after neglecting her for so long. Whether that had anything to do with his reasons for writing it or not, it was that thought combined with Thom\u2019s letter being mentioned several times in book 10 that kept me from being terribly surprised when her storyline came back up in this book. I was very happy to see it, though.I never really did understand why all the characters seemed so convinced Moiraine was dead. Especially the characters who had been through the mirrors themselves. And especially considering all the references to Min\u2019s viewings about her being \u201cwrong\u201d when Min has apparently never been wrong before. Back in book six, when we learned about the Bowl of Winds being in a storage room full of artifacts, I had it in my head that another mirror or some other artifact that could get Moiraine out would be found there and that the letter she had written Thom included instructions about it. So I was completely wrong there. After they finally found the bowl but not Moiraine, I started to realize I was going to have to wait a while for any kind of resolution.I had initially expected Moiraine\u2019s letter to Thom to contain some information about how/when he would find her. After all, she told him in book four that she\u2019d see him again when she was sending him to Tarabon with the girls, and she never saw him again before she fell through the mirror. But then so much time passed and he didn\u2019t do or say anything. And then in book 10 he was reading the letter constantly and claiming it was written by a \u201cdead woman\u201d, so I got thrown off track by that and figured it must not contain anything about Moiraine herself but rather had something else of personal importance to him such as maybe his nephew. Of course, now it makes perfect sense \u2013 he was reading it constantly in Mat\u2019s presence to try to provoke Mat to ask him about it because he couldn\u2019t do anything until that happened. I hope they go rescue her in the next book and don\u2019t drag her story out all the way until the very end of the series. Geez, now I\u2019ve written three paragraphs about a storyline that barely had any page time in this book. :) I was happy to see Halima finally unmasked. I was also glad that Perrin was finally able to rescue Faile. Hopefully Perrin can start getting interesting again. His part of the story was starting to get on my nerves because it was mostly angst. Faile\u2019s part was actually pretty interesting to me, because there was more going on and also because I\u2019ve been interested in Morgase who was captured with her. Faile seems to be at her most annoying when she\u2019s around Perrin, though, so I\u2019m not looking forward to that. It looks like what\u2019s left of the Shaido are finally going to go back where they came from and stop causing trouble also, but I guess there are probably some scattered groups still around. I was also happy that Elayne seems to have finally won her throne, if only to see that storyline finally wrapped up. It\u2019s probably the one that\u2019s the least consistently interesting to me in comparison to the other storylines. There were quite a few identity revelations and hints in this book, about various Forsaken as well as Noal. And Rand\u2019s encounter with Semirhage was brief but dramatic, with him losing his left hand. His part of the story has seemed a little skimpy lately, although usually what little there is of it has been interesting.

However, she is learning, finally, in this book, that he is not JUST a fascinating young gambler and a \u2018pretty\u2019 to queens\u2026Rand, on the other hand, is all sorrow and serious business. No wonder when he bears the heaviest burdens and the largest griefs. Every eye is on every move he makes, and everyone with leadership responsibilities wants to tell him what to do, control him or kill him. He has many secrets he cannot tell, but he must carry the WOT on his back alone\u2026Egwene is also finding the higher meanings of her existence under the torture of her worst enemy, Elaida, the false Amyrlin Seat. Elaida has made Egwene her prisoner, and she intends to break Egwene\u2019s will. Elaida is not going to have any rebel Amyrlin fighting to remove Elaida as leader of the Aes Sedai!Elayne is fighting many battles on many fronts - she wants to be queen of Andor; her hometown full of her supporters is under siege; she has vicious competitors for her throne; and spies and Black Ajah are everywhere underfoot. Plus she is pregnant! Perrin cannot focus on anything except getting Faile back. She has been a slave prisoner of the evil Shaido tribe of the Aiel for almost 60 days! It means war, but a very careful war. Unfortunately, the Shaido have a great many Wise Ones with the ability to channel the Power, while Perrin has only a few men and women able to channel. Freeing Faile is going to be tricky\u2026Well, so here we are - the last book Robert Jordon wrote for \u2018The Wheel of Time\u2019 series. I can affirm he did not get to the Last Battle. A number of threads were tied off, but unfortunately major plot points are still continuing by the end of \u2018Knife of Dreams\u2019, book 11. It feels like a \u2018Knife of Dreams\u2019 straight into my own anxious heart. However, gentle reader, I am not full of despair. Brandon Sanderson was asked by Robert Jordan\u2019s widow to finish the series. Jordan left behind notes and drafts which explained how he wanted WOT to be completed. Sanderson courageously decided to take it on! So, be brave too, gentle reader. The series WAS finished in published books 12, 13, and 14.

In fact, I haven't written a review in a while, so there's all this artistic energy pent up in my nethers. This is another installment in the series where nothing really happens, but the nothing is ever so slightly more interesting than nothing in the previous books.Most of the action revolves around Aes Sedai talking over coffee, plotting, counter-plotting, and such. There some warfare for those who like epic battles with banners flying and such, but not enough to steal away from the stalemate that grips the series.

The dead are walking, men die impossible deaths, and it seems as though reality itself has become unstable: All are signs of the imminence of Tarmon Gai'don, the Last Battle, when Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn, must confront the Dark One as humanity's only hope. But Rand dares not fight until he possesses all the surviving seals on the Dark One's prison and has dealt with the Seanchan, who threaten to overrun all nations this side of the Aryth Ocean and increasingly seem too entrenched to be fought off. But his attempt to make a truce with the Seanchan is shadowed by treachery that may cost him everything. Whatever the price, though, he must have that truce. And he faces other dangers. There are those among the Forsaken who will go to any length to see him dead--and the Black Ajah is at his side.... Unbeknownst to Rand, Perrin has made his own truce with the Seanchan. It is a deal made with the Dark One, in his eyes, but he will do whatever is needed to rescue his wife, Faile, and destroy the Shaido who captured her. Among the Shaido, Faile works to free herself while hiding a secret that might give her her freedom or cause her destruction. And at a town called Malden, the Two Rivers longbow will be matched against Shaido spears. Fleeing Ebou Dar through Seanchan-controlled Altara with the kidnapped Daughter of the Nine Moons, Mat attempts to court the woman to whom he is half-married, knowing that she will complete that ceremony eventually. But Tuon coolly leads him on a merry chase as he learns that even a gift can have deep significance among the Seanchan Blood and what he thinks he knows of women is not enough to save him. For reasons of her own, which she will not reveal until a time of her choosing, she has pledged not to escape, but Mat still sweats whenever there are Seanchan soldiers near. Then he learns that Tuon herself is in deadly danger from those very soldiers. To get her to safety, he must do what he hates worse than work.... In Caemlyn, Elayne fights to gain the Lion Throne while trying to avert what seems a certain civil war should she win the crown.... In the White Tower, Egwene struggles to undermine the sisters loyal to Elaida from within.... The winds of time have become a storm, and things that everyone believes are fixed in place forever are changing before their eyes. Even the White Tower itself is no longer a place of safety. Now Rand, Perrin and Mat, Egwene and Elayne, Nynaeve and Lan, and even Loial, must ride those storm winds, or the Dark One will triumph.", "title": "Knife of Dreams\n      \n          (The Wheel of Time #11)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13888.Knife_of_Dreams", "average": 4.13, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1397856387l/13888.jpg", "reviews": 1579, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6252.Robert_Jordan", "name": "Robert Jordan"}], "type": ["Fantasy", "Fiction", "Fantasy"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13888.Knife_of_Dreams", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/618171.Knife_of_Dreams", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8260859-knife-of-dreams", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1190036.Knife_of_Dreams", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1002260.Knife_of_Dreams", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25329672-knife-of-dreams", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12743260-knife-of-dreams", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22068239-d-han-eri", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/228665.The_Eye_of_the_World", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/233649.The_Great_Hunt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34897.The_Dragon_Reborn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9539.The_Shadow_Rising", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1166599.The_Gathering_Storm", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19755140-embassytown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32858845-off-to-be-the-wizard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10931746-the-stepford-wives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13604418-the-long-earth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34111309-the-man-of-legends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193375-fellside", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204943-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18806963-prayers-to-broken-stones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18126623-2061", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29425329-alas-babylon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193696-3001", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18162904-dreams-and-shadows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35106805-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25353286-provenance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23249416-an-unwelcome-quest"]}
