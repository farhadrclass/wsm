It\u2019s not even desirable. Being \u2018\u2019proper\u2019\u2019 is all that matters. \u2018\u2019Proper\u2019\u2019 according to the wishes of the people who inhabit the god-forsaken town and who seem to have been created without something vital for any human being. Heart and soul.Prepare for major distributions of anger on my part. Not because I didn\u2019t like the novel. Obviously, I did. I loved it and more so because it created strong feelings in me. The most powerful of all being anger. But more on that later:) Petroleum is a depressing town that discriminates everyone and everything. Mary works as an embalmer in her father\u2019s funeral parlour and many call her \u2018\u2019freak\u2019\u2019 because of her profession. Robert returns years after a tragic accident to look after his dying mother and the people behave as if he\u2019s got the plague. Mary and Robert are two souls who struggle to stand for themselves in the midst of hatred, prejudice and hypocrisy.One could say that there\u2019s not much \u2018\u2019action\u2019\u2019 in the course of the story, that not many \u2018\u2019things\u2019\u2019 happen. I don\u2019t believe that \u2018\u2019action\u2019\u2019 is always necessary for a novel to be interesting. I\u2019m sure that daily life offers many secrets worthy of a story. For me, the most important thing while reading is feelings, the way the story and the characters make me react and this is where I return to my initial thoughts in this review. I felt a lot of anger. Anger towards a community that has no tolerance for what they cannot understand or forgive. Anger towards a father who cares nothing for his daughter\u2019s happiness and plays the \u2018\u2019righteous\u2019\u2019 part while he\u2019s pretty dishonest and cold-hearted. Anger towards Mary because she was a coward and in need of a shock to put some sense into her mind, since she was unable to do so herself.Henderson structures the story around two themes, relationships and the sins of the past. The conflicts that lurk in the relationship between a parent and a child, between members of a community, between two people who love each other but people\u2019s enmity keeps them apart. The writer successfully develops the issue of being unable to fully escape the past, a theme that is a favorite in Contemporary American Literature, and stresses the \u2018\u2019holier-than-thou\u2019 attitude of the residents, the selfishness of a parent who fears loneliness and the bravery of the young generation to stand up for what is right. Robert has this strength, Mary has to find it.The characters- whether we like them or not- are interesting and well-written for the purpose each one of them serves. I liked Robert, I found him courageous, down to earth, considerate to those who mattered and rather calm as a person. He coped with hostility in an assuring, albeit a bit too meek, way. Mary gave me quite a trouble, I confess. I did like her, but I wanted more. You\u2019re thirty years old, why do you let everyone treat you as if you are a naive child? She has retained some rather distorted notions of familial and social obligations in her head. Her father was a man I deeply loathed. Am I too harsh? Possibly. I wanted him to vanish, to get the Hell out of Mary\u2019s life in some way. I haven\u2019t been so furious with a character in a while. The real jewel character, though, is Doris. The mysterious woman in the window\u2026I loved Henderson\u2019s writing. It is direct and beautiful, the chapters are short, the narration is quick and never loses momentum. There was a certain kind of tenderness in the language, but no trace of melodrama and the dialogue was natural. It was hard for me to stop reading, I wanted to know how the story ended, how could Mary escape the suffocating environment in a place whose beauty was wasted in worthless, medieval notions of right and wrong.I found this novel to be a more realistic depiction of the narrow-minded small communities than the quaint little towns with the quirky characters we\u2019ve come to see lately. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love those stories, but here we have the raw, unforgiving story of highly unforgiving people\u2026.Many thanks to Harper Perennial and Edelweiss for this ARC in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "A small Midwestern town, a close knit community of framers, ranchers and those who work in the grain industry, these are proud, hardworking people. All this changes, when the towns golden boy, a terrific athlete is killed in a grain accident. His younger brother is working with him that day, and the town blames this young fourteen year old for the accident. The mill closes and the town slowly begins to die. Mary, a young girl already an outcast as her father is the towns funeral director and mortician. Now as an adult she helps her father in his business, has become expert at making sure the dead look their best for their visitation. Things go along, until Robert comes back to town to take care of his dying mother, the town is not willing to forgive but for Mary she sees a different side.A very melancholic tone to this novel, the kind I tend to be drawn to time after time. Great characterizations and a wonderful look at life in a small dying town. A look at how differences in thoughts and actions divide, about being different and not fitting into the preconceived stereotypes. It is touching, written with a great deal of empathy and grace. It is a beautiful and quiet novel.It is also an odd to the hardworking men, those who struggle against weather and other conditions beyond their control. Those who rise before sunup to take care of their livestock, work in their fields. Watching the youth of their town move away wanting a different life. Men and women who stick with the town, wanting to stay and die in the town they call their own.It is mostly though, Mary's story as she grows and learns to look beyond the familiar. A loving look at a father and daughter, who have lived alone all of Mary's life. Working together, yet not able to talk about the important things in their lives, to discuss their feelings.

A horrible deadly incident in the grainary shaft causes the town to become unmoored. It causes the townspeople to wrongly make blame and also to never forget or forgive. It will be the end all curse to the town\u2019s livelihood and debilitating descent. Its closure causes the farmers to go away, farther down the road to another town to do their business of corn and wheat processing. Agricultural business that has taken away jobs and money and people from Petroleum. Throughout the book we discover how wrong and how damaging this event was, as well as how thoughts and feelings contribute to the demise of the people and the town. However, with only an occasional passer by or someone actually leaving Petroleum for brighter horizons, it\u2019s the same citizens, nursing the same regrets, the same slights, the continuing downward spiral. The next generation is no better, following in the footsteps of the sins of their fathers. Unless you get yourself out, history has a way of repeating itself. It\u2019s a never ending cycle in a failing town. This is a haunting, tender, emotional read of the Clampton\u2019s; the father and his only daughter, Mary, who run the towns\u2019 only funeral home out of their house. Mary\u2019s mother died during her birth so Mary has not had a female maternal presence in her life growing up. Growing up, she was constantly ostracized by other kids and called names; now as an adult, she is not socially comfortable and continues to live with and take care of her Father, at times handling the embalming responsibilities by herself or sometimes with her Father. Her father got into the funeral business by accident, and he works this up socially as a true businessman, because at some point in time, those people will be coming to him for his business. His clothes and personality and demeanor are always top notch in public but once home, behind closed doors, he collapses into himself, with exhaustion, depression, loneliness and alcohol. Mary, who did not have a normal childhood, exposes herself at an early age to a dead body in the mortuary in the basement and gets involved in the funerary proceedings which happen in the parlor and basement at the house. She not only physically and mentally accepts this, but likes it, and starts helping, then taking over for her father in preparing the deceased. Mary has a deep connection and ultimate respect for the deceased as she prepares them for the funeral showing. She takes her time preparing - washing them, styling their hair, dressing them, applying make up... She sits with them quietly, holding their hands and remembers them when they were alive. Her feelings and ministrations as she works on them are so genuine and so peaceful. I was impressed and touched with the personal care and concern she showed to the dead. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not the norm.Mary had aspirations when in school to become an artist. Well, that of course was not about to happen in this small, self-insulated town, so as she began to take over responsibilities of the funeral home, covering for her struggling father\u2019s inadequacies and drinking, she took her art skills into transforming the dead into the best of what they were in life. With exquisite care and extreme reverence, she often worked on the bodies well into the night because she wanted to replicate them as they looked in real life. Because this is such a small town, the funeral business of course, is not booming, so Mary and her father are financially unstable. There are stacks of unpaid bills on the table; most folks here don\u2019t have the money to pay for a funeral, but will barter with other means of payment; that\u2019s how much of a struggle it is for the people of this town. It\u2019s quite sad and depressing; everyone who stays in this town is \u201cstuck\u201d staying for one reason or another. Not many venture out to strike out on their own, go somewhere else. Those who do, usually don\u2019t come back and those that do, are not welcome. And so this brings us to Robert. Robert is the younger brother of Eddie, the town\u2019s golden boy and apple of his parents\u2019 eyes. Eddie is the boy who tragically died young and in his prime, in the grainary bin accident, with his younger brother Robert, harnessed above him, also working in the bin, but spared from sinking into the air pockets of corn by his harness apparatus. Eddie was not wearing one.There is fallout to the town after this catastrophic event. There is fallout to that family and among the townsfolk. Robert returns to Petroleum after many years of being sent away to live with an aunt after the accident. The townsfolk are so quick to judge that he is only back now to get money from his mother, Doris\u2019 impending death from terminal lung cancer. They have no idea what the family has gone through, or what Robert has gone through. He is shunned and threatened by the townfolk as soon as he comes back. The town sheriff chooses to turn his back on the incidents. Robert comes to the funeral home to make preparations for his mother\u2019s impending death and Mary is intrigued by him and it brings back questions, memories, but it also opens up her eyes and mind to how stifled she is here in this town, giving up her art aspirations, taking care of her Father, running the mortuary, having no friends, no experiences outside of this decaying town. As they interact, Robert shares more background of his life growing up with Eddie and his parents, details of the accident and how it all impacted him, and his current life in Seattle. It is a spark that ignites Mary into a friendship/relationship with him, that must be hidden or there would be repercussions toward her (and her Father) for getting involved with \u201cthe enemy.\u201d This town does not forgive, nor does it forget. In time, Mary\u2019s Father realizes that she and Robert have more than just funeral business between them. And does he perceive this as a threat? When Robert\u2019s mother passes away at the start of a huge snowstorm that paralyzes the funeral and burial plans, a huge insult and betrayal occurs. It is a very sad and very selfish act of desperation and fear. I felt every emotion of each character in this book. They were very well done and woven together in and around the town\u2019s history and current state of affairs. 5 Star poignant, unsettling, haunting and hopeful. I wish Mary the best; she has sacrificed her entire life to her Father and to the town and to the funeral business. There is so much more out there in the world for her and the others, if they should choose to take that opportunity."}, {"userName": "Marjorie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32379875-marjorie", "userReview": "Although Mary Crampton had dreams of being an artist when she was younger, she stayed on in the dying town of Petroleum.

The main culprit turned out to be the victim\u2019s 14-year-old brother, Robert Golden. The residents of Petroleum were ruthless and cruel to Robert, and made him leave the town soon after.Fast forward two decades later, and the town is in the same place as it was immediately following the tragedy --- in a permanent state of latent depression.

The slow, stark atmosphere absorbed me. This town, hollowed out yet still there, felt so real (along with the characters inhabiting it).

Add in the perfectly captured feeling of being an outsider, carrying it around inside you, and it\u2019s no wonder I felt tethered and pulled to this book.I can\u2019t say it was a joy to read, because that\u2019s not the type of book this is, but it was an experience I\u2019m glad to have had. I ended up reading most of it straight through because I found it hard to jump in and out of, it was much better to me if I just stayed in for the whole journey.

With a population of 178, a number that continually dwindles as residents die or move away, life remains unchanged. Until a once vilified teen returns home to care for his dying mother and reconnects with the one neighbor who is not offended by his presence. In Susan Henderson\u2019s THE FLICKER OF OLD DREAMS, a novel you don\u2019t read as much as get instantly absorbed by, we meet Mary Crampton, the funeral director\u2019s daughter and Robert Golden, the boy held responsible for his brother\u2019s tragic death in a grain elevator accident. His death spurred the closing of the granary and the ultimate blow to Petroleum\u2019s economy which should signal the end of the story. But Ms. Henderson, one of the most compelling and daring writers of our time, explores the meaning of heart and home in ways that open doors not shut them. In lesser hands, the narrative would be a messy word salad instead of the exquisite, poetic chronicle of humanity that it is. And able hands are indeed where the story delves. Thirty-year-old Mary, now the resident embalmer, treats each of the dead with more dignity than they may have known while breathing. Using surgical tools, machines and personal care items like cotton balls and nail polish, she painstakingly sutures, powders and massages the deceased, even manipulating their lips and cheeks to duplicate their exact smile so mourners will pay last respects with admiration. But it is Mary\u2019s compassion and artistry that come to life when she squeezes the remaining fluids out of organs and stitches closed every orifice to inhibit offending odors. \u201cThe dead come to me vulnerable, sharing their stories and secrets,\u201d she says. And before their flabby, scarred and bruised bodies are lowered into the ground, she will work into the night to make sure they are remembered for their true beauty.If only Mary could use her artistic talent to become a famous painter as she once hoped. Leave Petroleum and her widowed father to find true love. See the ocean. Smell salt air instead of the stench of livestock dung. Perhaps the return of Robert will wake up those dormant dreams.

It has been in decline for twenty years, ever since the accident that took the life of a local high schooler and shut down the grain elevator, the town\u2019s main source of employment. The younger brother of the victim was blamed for his death and sent to live with relatives.Mary Crampton has lived in Petroleum for thirty years, her whole life, and during those years she has always been a social outcast. Perhaps it is because her father owns the mortuary, or because she grew up without a mother, but Mary has never belonged. Now that she is the embalmer for her father, she is even more set apart from the townspeople around her. She had dreamed of becoming an artist, but now she finds satisfaction in her job, trying to capture the essence of a subject\u2019s life.When Robert Golden, the brother who has been blamed for the town's demise for years, returns to care for his dying mother, old resentments and condemnations return and are all directed at him. In Robert, Mary finds an unexpected soulmate who is also an outsider. Neither Robert nor Mary conform to the expectations of the towns citizens, but Mary's burgeoning friendship and relationship with him shock and dismay the town, while Robert's presence evokes anger and acting out. The Flicker of Old Dreams is an exquisite, beautifully written, memorable novel. In fact, it is hard to comment on such a well-written novel that seems to capture the very heart and soul of two lonely people who have been considered pariahs by the town, yet are still expected to conform to the will and expectations set by the same people. These are finely detailed, well-developed, and wonderfully crafted characters. The town itself becomes a character, as the inhabitants seem to act as one.Henderson has created an unforgettable character in Mary - heartbreaking and so tender, caring and loyal to her father and their dying town, even as it sucks the life right out of her. Anyone who has ever lived as an outsider in a small narrow minded town or in a family of the same ilk will understand Mary's untenable position, where she can never be a part of the town and, really, must find the way to escape in order to truly live her life. Her father, and the town, expect so much from her, mostly to live up to their expectations, and yet give so little in return. The ending is perfect, presenting redemption and hope.Disclosure: My review copy was courtesy of HarperCollins Publishers.http://www.shetreadssoftly.com/2018/0..."}, {"userName": "Tammy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1004125-tammy", "userReview": "After an accident at the grain elevator, the people of Petroleum struggle to make ends meet in this small dying town.

It is a lament for a town and its people who can no longer live and compete in the larger world. It is a poem about the Montana plains, all of its creatures, topography and climate filled with hardness and stark beauty. It is a call to those who are shackled by fear. But, most of all, this book is reminder that change no matter how hard\u2014and the heroine, a child of trauma, whose sole parent is emotionally unavailable, has it hard\u2014is possible if we look beyond external appearances and give ourselves permission to let go. Reading this was like riding a rollercoaster: thrilling, jarring, terrifying and had me gripping imaginary hand rails in case I got thrown off. The book awakened many emotions as I read and the more I read I realized that the author had me firmly in hand and all I had to do was to trust her to lead me to the story. She did. Flicker of Old Dreams is dreamily beautiful and a brilliantly executed book. It soars.

As many lay dying she is in her place of work, working on the dead, as her craft is to bring some beauty to the dead as an embalmer, she\u2019s the embalmer and her father is the funeral director.The author successfully transports the reader to a town called petroleum with a narrative delivering a meditation on loss, love, death, family, resilience, and identity with heart felt hypnotic prose. A luminous account on feelings as an outsider in ways, to the norms and traditions, and paternal love in tow and breaking out from home and crucible.\u00a0The author crafted some great sentences in this tale, a prose with empathy, a world the narrator loves and loathes at the same time, great sentences expounding on the complexities and fragilities of the human heart one that echoes John Steinbeck, Flannery O\u2019Connor, and William Faulkner.Excerpts and review @ https://more2read.com/review/the-flicker-of-old-dreams-by-susan-henderson/"}, {"userName": "Tabitha Lord", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32957827-tabitha-lord", "userReview": "Susan Henderson\u2019s stunning new novel, The Flicker of Old Dreams, thoughtfully explores themes of redemption, forgiveness, resilience, and love. And, true to it\u2019s title, asks whether it\u2019s ever too late to pursue one\u2019s dreams. Years ago, a terrible accident shut down the mill in Petroleum, and as a result, the small midwestern town has been slowly dying out. The residents of Petroleum turned their desperate, misplaced anger on the victim\u2019s brother, Robert Golden, who left town soon after the accident. Still an outcast, he returns home to care for his terminally ill mother and is befriended by the local mortician, Mary Crampton. Herself an outsider, Mary is drawn to Robert, and for the first time in her life she considers leaving her home in pursuit of her long-buried dreams. Susan Henderson captures the essence of life in rural America with stunning imagery, lyric prose, and depth of feeling.

The story is told from the eyes of Mary Crompton, a Midwestern girl that gave up on her own dreams to care for her father and the family\u2019s mortuary. Mary spends her days hiding from her dreams and from the world outside the mortuary doors, spending more time with the bodies she embalms than with any true friends. That is until the return of Robert Golden, the younger brother of the grain elevator accident victim, who arrives in town to care for his terminally ill mother. Mary and Robert, both outcasts from the locals that agonize, judge, and blame Robert for the accident, develop a friendship that dares Mary to consider what life would have been like if she left Petroleum. Deeply heartfelt, Susan Henderson\u2019s sophomore novel is not only the love story of two outcasts searching to belong, but also the love story of a daughter and her father, a people and a town, and a girl and her dreams. A Flicker of Old Dreams is everything that great novels are-affecting and deeply honest. It reminds us that while our dreams may lead us away from home, home will never be away from us."}, {"userName": "Pam", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4899318-pam", "userReview": "Exquisitely written novel of a tiny Montana town and a vanishing way of life.

This book has been reviewed so beautifully already that it\u2019s hard to add much, but I\u2019m going to try anyway.This is an exceptional book in that Henderson is able to depict the strange coexistence of comfort & suffocation, both, that a small town provides for its residents. There is always compassion in this story, for the living as well as the dead, the fearful as well as the courageous. Every character, no matter how flawed, is treated with both kindness & relentless realism.Another outstanding aspect of this novel is the landscape. The town of Petroleum is as much a character as any of the human ones in this story. Henderson gives the town its own spirit & it makes the whole book even more effective & compelling.While the story is filled with insights, Henderson has a lovely style, able to pull the reader close in without letting go til the last page. Even then, Petroleum & its people will likely remain in the reader\u2019s heart for a long time to come.Cannot recommend this highly enough."}], "description": "With the quiet precision of Jane Smiley\u2019s A Thousand Acres and the technical clarity of Mary Roach\u2019s Stiff, this is a novel about a young woman who comes most alive while working in her father\u2019s mortuary in a small, forgotten Midwestern town\u201cThe dead come to me vulnerable, sharing their stories and secrets\u2026\u201dMary Crampton has spent all of her thirty years in Petroleum, a small Midwestern town once supported by a powerful grain company.
