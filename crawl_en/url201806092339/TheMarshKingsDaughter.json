I knew it wasn't going to be released until June but I couldn't wait to read it. Once I started reading I didn't want to stop.The narrator tells us that her mother was famous for things no one would never want to be famous for. She says we may recognize her mother's name, but we probably haven't thought about her for years....but she is sure we would remember she had a daughter and we would wonder what happened to her.\"But I won't tell you my mother's name. Because this isn't her story. It's mine\" Helena was twelve and her mother was twenty-eight when they were recovered from their captor. Helena had no idea they were captives. She never went to school, never rode a bicycle, never knew electricity or running water and only ever spoke with two people in twelve years. Her mother and father.We learn that after leaving the marsh, Helena really struggled with social skills. After years of living only with her mother and father, Helena had to learn how to fit in and how to act in public and social situations. \n\"Shake hands when you meet someone. Don't pick your nose. Go to the back of the line. Wait your turn. Don't burp or pass gas in the presence of others\"\nAfter all these years, Helena seems to finally have the life she deserves. The bad days are behind her. Happily married with two daughters and her thriving business.Unfortunately, the past isn't as buried as deep she thought.....The story begins in the present. Helena Pelletier is dropping off orders of her homemade jam. Tourists and locals love her jam and sales are good. Helena decides to take her three-year old daughter, Mari to the beach after deliveries are done. She loses track of time and needs to hurry to meet her older daughter's bus. She turns on the radio in hopes that the music will help with her toddlers current meltdown. As she flips through the radio stations she hears the words escaped....prisoner ....armed and dangerous. It repeats. A dangerous man has escaped from prison, killing two guards in the process. They believe he's headed for the wild life refuge close to her home. But when she hears the name of the prisoner her heart nearly stops.Jacob Hollbrook aka \"The Marsh King\" was serving a life sentence for child abduction and other crimes. The reason Helena is so horrified is that SHE is the one who put him in prison.Jacob Hollbrook.....is her father.She worries the police won't find him. He's in his element in the woods. She may have felt safe from him when he was behind bars. But now everything has changed. She hoped she would be able to tell her husband, Stephen all of the things she meant to tell him all of these years. However, before she has the chance, the police arrive to question her. They want to know if she knows where her father is. Stephen is in shock and also terrified for his family. He decides they should go to his parents until her father is captured. Helena tells him she must stay behind to help the police. Which is only partially true.What she doesn't tell her husband is that she is going to go after her father. She's the only one who will be able to find him...using the skills her taught her himself.She is The Marsh King's daughter and he taught her well.The book alternates between the past and the present. Told from Helena's perspective, we learn a lot about her childhood. Her relationship with her father at the centre of it all. I can't imagine the internal struggle and conflicting emotions she would have, growing up the way she did. Twelve years is a long time and the bond has been created whether we like it or not. It would not be as easy as we think to turn off those feelings.\n\"part of me that will forever be the little pigtailed girl who idolized her father\"\nThe Marsh King's Daughter fairy tale by Hans Christian Anderson, is interspersed between chapters, which added to the story.I've often wondered about women like Elisabeth Fritzl, Amanda Berry, and Jaycee Dugard and so many other women who have escaped or been rescued after being held captive for years. I've occasionally wondered about the children as well but this book really made it hit home for me. Of course it's difficult for the women who were help captive, but the children who were conceived and born in similar conditions? How would they acclimate to their new world?...new lives?The characters, setting, and the plot are very well developed. Karen Dionne did an amazing job bringing her characters to life. Helena is damaged but also very brave and strong. I'm not a hunter so I did have a hard time reading some of the aspects of the hunting, killing and cleaning of the animals. However, I don't feel it was done in a way to glorify violence but it's a part of the story. This is how they lived and survived and it's amazing the things Helena learned at such a young age.An amazing read that I really could have read it in one sitting. As I neared the end there's not much that could have torn me away. Compelling, intense, and unputdownable. This book is one that is going to stay with me for a very long time. I can't wait to see what Karen Dionne writes next.Thank you G.P. Putnam's Sons and Karen Dionne for providing an advanced readers copy of this book for me to read in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Paromjit", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38610813-paromjit", "userReview": "This is atmospheric and brilliant storytelling from an author whose talent becomes increasingly obvious as you begin to read this tale. Its appeal lies in the twin interweaving of dark fantastical fairytale and the more human tale of the hunter and the prey, where these roles shift, change, merging into a hypnotic dance between father and daughter. Helena is married to Stephen, a photographer and has two daughters, Iris and Mari. She lives in Michigan's Upper Peninsula on the edge of the marsh wilderness. She created a new identity to escape the media coverage that followed her mother's kidnapping at 15 by the notorious Marsh King, Jacob Holbrook, Helena's father. Helena is brought up on the marshes, seeing no other humans until she is 11 years old. She is a wild child, a daddy's girl, and instrumental in ensuring that her father went to prison. Her family know none of her well publicised history. The Marsh King has escaped, killing two guards, with the consequent police manhunt and media spotlight. Helena can no longer hide, she knows the only person with the skills to find her father is her, no-one knows him better, he is Nanabozho, the trickster, and she loves him. She is determined that she will return him to prison. The book is an intimate character study delivered from Helena's perspective. Each chapter starts with a part of the The Marsh King's Daughter fairytale by Hans Christian Anderson with inescapable connections to Helena's life. Her father is a storyteller whose tales whilst blurring the line between fact and fiction are hardwired into her psyche, into her blood, and her sense of identity. He is the sole contributer to her unsurpassed abilities in hunting, tracking, wilderness and survival skills. He is everything, her mother barely features. She is him, his shadow, the pea to his pod. We learn of her time growing up in the marshes, her obsession with 50 year old National Geographics - her only knowledge of the world outside, her enthrallment with the Vikings, her use of the doll that her mother made for her for target practice. We are given glimpses into her father's volatility and his need for absolute control. But can Helena remember everything? What exactly happened? What of Cousteau and Calypso? A faint memory tugs from her subconscious...something about the story her mother told her. This shapes a dangerous and blood spattered hunt for her father where her family is at stake into a journey into the past to come to terms with and acknowledge who she is.This is a wonderful novel, it burrows into your consciousness and takes residence. It has an insidious charm with its themes of what it is to survive, love, loss, memory, and the problems associated with doing the right thing in a complicated family set up. The book has a riveting narrative interweaving the fantastical with the everyday, of a nature red in tooth and claw side by side with glimpses of nurture and protection. Helena is complex and her life has not been easy, you cannot help but want to know more about her. We come to understand the call of the wild is a representation of home. The Marsh King is not purely a figure of evil but a father who loves and is intimately connected with his daughter. The family, the roles and relationships within it, is often a can of worms exploited in fairytales and fiction, the author beautifully explores this territory. Cannot recommend this enough. Many thanks to Little, Brown for an ARC."}, {"userName": "Candace", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16384209-candace", "userReview": "Lately, I've been reading a little more suspense/thriller. 'The Marsh King's Daughter' is the most recent book in this genre to catch my attention. It certainly lived up to my expectations for a creepy, edge of my seat story.The story centers on Helena, a woman with a secret past. While she lives her \"normal\" life as a mother, occupied with mundane daily issues, there is far more going on beneath the surface. She is always looking over her shoulder, never quite able to settle down or rest easy.What Helena hasn't told anyone is that her father is the notorious \"Marsh King\". He abducted her mother when she was a young girl, holding her captive for many years and forcing her to be his wife. Helena is a product of her mother's abuse at the hands of her abductor.Of course, Helena did not know this for much of her youth. She was raised in a cabin in an isolated marsh. She grew up hunting and learning to survive off of the land. Truth be told, she loved it. She didn't know of any other way.Looking back, she can see that her childhood wasn't without hardship. Her father's rule was supreme. If she or her mother dared to cross him, they were punished swiftly and harshly. As a child, she didn't have a basis for comparison. Now, it is clear to her that his actions were abusive.Helena has long since come to terms with the fact that her father is a narcissistic psychopath. Everything in their lives revolved around keeping him happy. They lived in constant fear of setting him off, knowing that he could turn into a cruel, sadistic monster with the flip of a switch.When Helena receives word that her father has escaped from prison, she has no doubt that he will be coming for her. After all, she knows that she was to blame for his eventual arrest. A man like her father doesn't forget and he doesn't forgive.Her worst fears are proved true when a series of gruesome clues begins to pile up. It seems that her father is taunting her and trying to draw her back into a game that they used to play when she was little...only this time, she is hunting him. Sometimes, the hunter becomes the hunted though. As Helena trekked through the wilderness in search of her father, I had chills. An eerie feeling pervaded this story from start to finish. All I can say is that it was creepy...very creepy.Despite my enjoyment, I have to admit that I had a difficult time connecting with Helena. I admired her strength and the fact that she stood out from other heroines. However, I couldn't really relate to her much. It made it a little more difficult for me to connect with the story, but eventually I did.Once this story got warmed up, it had my complete attention. As Helena's past was revealed through flashbacks, I began to piece together the entirety of the her life's story. Her father, who seemed harmless at first, was gradually shown to be a truly cruel man as the violence he bestowed upon his family increased over the years.This was a great book. It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time I was listening. There is something to be said for a book that can still make you want to check under your bed for monsters. If you're in the mood for something creepy and disconcerting, this is the one.Check out more of my reviews at www.bookaddicthaven.com"}, {"userName": "Susanne Strong", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4514828-susanne-strong", "userReview": "5 Stars.Truly Captivating (for Helena, and Me). \u201cThe Marsh King\u2019s Daughter\u201d hooks you from first few sentences: \u201cI was born two years into my Mother\u2019s captivity. She was three weeks shy of seventeen. If I had known then, what I do now, things would have been a lot different. I wouldn\u2019t have adored my Father.\u201d How could it not? It keeps you suspended on that hook throughout. Helena is born under captivity .. yet she doesn\u2019t know it. She grows up, learning to fish, trap, wield a knife and shoot, all by the age of 6. And she adores her father and thinks he is the coolest. She lives in the marshlands with her mom, her dad and their dog Rambo and it\u2019s all she has ever known. Whatever she has learned has been through National Geographic or through her father. Little Helena does not know that her life is not a normal one. Her mother was kidnapped at the age of fourteen by her father, Jacob Holbrook and he has been keeping her captive all this time. When Helena is twelve, she and her mother are rescued, Jacob is captured and all is revealed. Years later, a grown-up Helena is living a new life with her family knowing absolutely nothing about who she really is. That is, until one day when her Jacob Holbrook escapes from prison and she has to come face to face with her past, in order to save her family and herself from the man she both loves and hates, her own father. \u201cThe Marsh King\u2019s Daughter\u201d alternates between the past and the present: when Helena was young and she lived in the marshlands with her mother and father and the present day, as she is tracking her father after his escape from prison. The switch between timelines is effortless, worked very well and kept me in suspense the entire time. Helena\u2019s ever-changing views on her father over the course of the novel were fascinating, as were her feelings for her mother. Karen Dionne did a phenomenal job in creating truly compelling, multi-dimensional characters here \u2013 all of whom evoked different emotions from me at different times in the novel. The writing is stellar: gripping, compulsive and suspenseful.  And the idea of it? Scary as all get out. If this book doesn\u2019t grab your attention, nothing will.

It was dark and disturbing. I loved it. I was hooked from the very beginning and straight to the end. I didn't find this to be an edge of your seat thriller. It consisted of Helena's life in her past, being raised in captivity with her sociopath father and present, what her life was like afterwards. This book was very intriguing to me. I also found this to be very character driven. The author did Helena's character very well. My heart went out for Helena. Everything she went through was just awful. Jacob, the Marsh King was a sociopath. He was so self centered, centering himself on his needs and wants. He was a monster showing his true colors.I always love a book that has a setting in a forest. Its my tranquil, peaceful spot and love the sounds of nature. I love to sit by the bonfire and always feel mesmerized by it. But I could never imagine having a life in captivity like this for years and years, and thinking that Helena thought her life was normal is just beyond me. Who wouldn't though, if this is the life you were raised up in.My ReviewThis review does contain spoilers. If you don't want to read this part, read what I liked and didn't like and that will give you a view of what it is about.**********************************************Helena's mother was just barely seventeen years old and was raped and abducted by the Marsh King, Jacob. She lived in captivity for fourteen years. Helena was born in captivity. She did not know that her mother was raped and abducted. Helena lived in captivity for thirteen years of her life in the marsh. She did not have any contact with human beings except her father and mother. She didn't have any clue that this was not a normal life and that her father was a sociopath, a violent man. She loved her father very much.She went through years and years of abuse that was just awful. Her life was a nightmare and just unimaginable.She then escapes from captivity. She has problems dealing with everyday normal life to fit in.The story goes from the past to present. What Helena's life was like in captivity and then what her life is like afterwards.Helena gets married and has two kids and her past comes back to haunt her when her violent father escapes from prison and she has to protect her family.What I didn't like about the book?The hunting scenes were disturbing and almost to much for me. I can understand why it was in the book though, since Jacob was an Indian and hunting was his life.

NOW AVAILABLE !!4.5 StarsGrowing up, Helena never knew that they were different from other families; she didn\u2019t know the story of how she came to be, didn\u2019t know that her father had abducted her mother for the purpose of taking her as his wife. She loved her father, and didn\u2019t think of him as a bad or dangerous man, although she knew that he was quick to anger toward her mother, at times. She really didn\u2019t know any better, and how could she? She was his \u201dBangii-Agawaateyaa\u201d, his Little Shadow. The cabin they lived in out in the wild marshlands of Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula was completely isolated. If it weren\u2019t for the old National Geographic magazines she had seen and read, she would know little about other people, about the world in general. But knowing about it, and living in it are different. She knew that there was a world out there, she just didn\u2019t know how close, or how different it was from how they lived. She just didn\u2019t know. This is so beautifully written, the characters so fully drawn. Helena is a composite of her surroundings, her father, her isolation, her lack of understanding of any other kind of life than the one she\u2019s living \u2013 with the exception of those inside her magazines \u2013 such a wonderful, complex protagonist. With confident, gorgeous prose transporting you back and forth effortlessly through time and place, from Helena\u2019s childhood to the day she hears the emergency news broadcast.

She knows his ways, his stories, She also knows if she doesn\u2019t find him, her husband and her two girls lives will never be the same.

The premise is disturbing. Helena is the daughter of a man whom abducted her mom, who was incarcerated for his crime but has now escaped- to the marshlands of Michigan- where she grew up and was held hostage for the first 12 years of her life. Now, the hunt is on and she needs either to be the hunter or be the hunted. Helena, now on the search for her father, reflects back on her life growing up in the marsh as she searches for her convicted father. Her life, as she knew it until the age of 12, when she realized it was far from what a normal family should be. The episodes of patience and tenderness contrasted with violence and sadistic tendencies, make it a struggle between loving her father and hating him. Her imaginary friends she created, Calypso and Cousteau, who help her survival and in the end, her escape.Interspersed with quotes from the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale, The Marsh King, this is a fast paced, creepy one.

I was flipping those pages as fast as I could in anticipation and fascination finishing this book in less than 24-hrs. \u00a0I could not put this book down!KAREN DIONNE delivers an intense, atmospheric, and an angst driven read here with well-developed characters that is extremely well-written with a lot of detail. \u00a0Just a warning that there is also a very graphic hunting scene that some readers might find disturbing. \u00a0THE MARSH KING\u2019S DAUGHTER is told in our main characters, Helena\u2019s perspective alternating between the past and the present. \u00a0When we first meet Helena we learn that she is happily married with two little girls and then she gets news that her convicted father has escaped from prison and then the action begins with a heart-stopping cat and mouse game of daughter against father.From Helena\u2019s story in the past we learn all about her childhood of being raised in captivity where she is actually oblivious to the fact that her and her Mother are being held captive by her father. The way that Helena lived and survived while growing up in the marsh was actually quite amazing and I thoroughly enjoyed her story. Her story from the past and present were both equally compelling to me.Although, I wouldn\u2019t say that this novel was all that suspenseful for me it was the pacing, setting, writing, and the characters that I found so compelling.To sum it all up it was a riveting, enjoyable, suspenseful, fast-paced, quick and easy read with a satisfying ending.

They had no electricity, no creature comforts, but Helena learned so much from her father\u2014how to hunt; how to shoot; how to kill, dress, and cook an animal; how to appreciate nature and the outdoors. She never understood why her mother always seemed so afraid of her father, although she knew he hurt her from time to time, and while he punished Helena and sometimes taught her very painful lessons, she still idolized him, and wanted to be just like him.When she was 12 she finds out that her father kidnapped her mother when she was a teenager, and has kept her captive for 14 years. Helena was the product of this abduction. Although she is still too young to fully grasp the implications of this discovery, and is torn between still wanting to stay with him, and escaping a man she knows has the potential to be savagely violent.\"Most of the time when I look back at the way I was raised, I'm able to view things fairly objectively. Yes, I was the daughter of a kidnapped girl and her captor. For twelve years, I lived without seeing or speaking to another human being other than my parents. Put like that, it sounds pretty grim. But that was the hand I was dealt, and I needed to call a spade a spade if I was ever going to move forward...\"Years later, Helena's past is a secret from everyone, and in many ways, she is miles away from the girl she was when she was 12. She has a loving husband, two young daughters, and a business making artisan jams and jellies from the fruit that grows near her Upper Peninsula home. At times the niceties of social convention she learned late in life chafe her, and she must escape to the solitude and nature she cherished so much as a child. But despite her odd idiosyncrasies, her husband has no idea of her lineage.And then, some 20 years after her escape from the marsh, she hears on the news that a prisoner has escaped from his maximum security confinement, killing two guards, and is headed toward the marshland. Her father. Suddenly Helena's life is wide open, much to her husband's surprise, and she realizes that her father is headed her way. She must do what her father trained her all those years ago: find him and capture him, before he harms others, before he destroys her family and the life she has made.\"The truth is, sometime between the officers' first question and when the door closed behind them, I realized that if anyone is going to catch my father and return him to prison, it's me. No one is my father's equal when it comes to navigating the wilderness, but I'm close. I lived with him for twelve years. He trained me, taught me everything he knows. I know how he thinks. What he'll do. Where he'll go.\"In \nThe Marsh King's Daughter\n, Karen Dionne has created a tense, emotional narrative, juxtaposing the story of a girl raised by a father she idolizes but doesn't understand, in an environment she loves but has no clue about the real reason they live there, and the story of a woman who has buried her past and tried, fitfully, to start anew, even though you can never truly lose who you are. Helena's past and present unfurl, and you understand what has brought her to this moment, but you don't really know how she'll react, when she's never truly felt comfortable anywhere other than the marsh.I thought this was a really terrific read, and it's one of those books that will make a fantastic movie. I was able to visualize Helena's search for her father, the warring feelings inside her hoping she'll find him and hoping he'll have left her behind once and for all. Dionne is a great storyteller, and even though the plot may be a little predictable, you are pulled in from the beginning and don't want to put the book down until you see how everything unfolds.A few caveats, however. For a book full of tension, I felt it dragged on a tiny bit too long\u2014I wanted to know everything about her childhood on the marsh and how she got to present day, but I also wanted the confrontation between daughter and father to come quicker than it did, although the payoff is worth it. The book does have some graphic violence (towards men and women, and some towards a child), some graphic descriptions of hunting and butchering animals, and a little bit of animal cruelty, so be forewarned. One or a combination of these may be a deal breaker for some.I hesitate using the term \"beach read,\" but \nThe Marsh King's Daughter\n really feels like one, full of suspense, action, and emotion.

To Helena, life in the marshlands is normal. She has no contact with the outside world, no electricity, no running water, no modern conveniences. She has grown to love her life of hunting and fishing; indeed she loves her Father and everything he teaches her about nature. Helena has no idea what her Father has done.Helena\u2019s only knowledge that there is a life outside of the marshes comes from some old National Geographic Magazines that she consumes with a passion. Her love for her Father is solid; but her mother on the other hand is something of an invisible creature, for she hardly ever smiles, never feels part of what Helena experiences with her father - so as the years pass, her mother becomes someone to be dismissed as inconsequential.Helena knows her Father can be cruel and violent (particularly when he needs to teach her a lesson), but she doesn't know any other way of life so she accepts his punishments without question.The narrative centered in the present day ratchets up the tension, for Helena is now married to Stephen and they have two young daughters Iris and Mari. She helps the family budget by making and selling jam to locals, and their life is good - until the day she hears the emergency broadcast announcing the escape of an armed and dangerous prisoner, the notorious child abductor \u2018The Marsh King\u2019, who is Helena\u2019s Father.Consumed with fear, Helena believes her Father will come looking for her as it was her fault that he was captured and incarcerated. She is now faced with confronting her past; a past she has kept hidden from her husband.Despite the dark and disturbing theme, The Marsh King\u2019s Daughter is a beautifully written book that swings effortlessly back and fro between the past and the present, slowly revealing the events leading up to Helena's escape from the marshlands.I should indicate that the narrative includes visceral scenes of the hunting, killing of animals (as well as the cleaning of carcasses), though not gratuitous for the wildlife were killed for food, for survival and not for pleasure.Karen Dionne\u2019s remarkable thriller gives a fascinating insight into the relationship between captor and captive, as well as between hunter and the hunted. It is also a deeply engaging and thought provoking psychological thriller. The tension at times becomes unbearable due to the quality of the writing, making you turn the pages as if hypnotized by the narrative.If you're brave enough to venture hand-in-hand with the author into the marshes, you'll certainly be well-rewarded, for The Marsh King\u2019s Daughter is exceptional and hugely recommended."}, {"userName": "Elyse", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse", "userReview": "Daddy was a sociopath.....who liked to tell stories... ....and his biological daughter, Helena, .....protagonist...(child version of Stockholm Syndrome), was almost like daddy's counterpart ....or as they often say: \"the apple doesn't fall far from the tree\".

Characters are well drawn and the plot is well thought out and chilling in places.I was a little afraid going into this one that it might be very graphic and while I did find a few of the hunting scenes quite tough reading, I understand the authors need to write these scenes as part of the bigger picture and they can be easily skimmed over if the reader finds them too much.A really well written novel, chilling, suspenseful, fresh and certainly one I will be recommending to my friends to pack for holidays this summer.

Many of my friends gorge themselves silly on gory murder stories. They appreciate the subtlety of pure unadulterated crime. Subtlety because of the nuances from book to sequel.I realized, 2/3 into the book, that Helena would be a wonderful heroine. On one hand she is hardcore, experienced and intuitive. But when the story most demands it, she plays into the hand of her father, 'The Marsh King'. Where is her training when she needs protection the most? That's brilliant artistic manipulation for you.I appreciate the pacing of the book. I also grudgingly give Karen Dionne points for presenting a tale that has a few atoms of originality.

A man kidnapping a woman and holding her hostage has been done before. But here, it's the daughter formed from that horrible union, telling the tale years later when her father escapes from prison. Helena obviously had the oddest of childhoods. Raised in the outback of the UP, she still bear hunts, fishes and makes jellies with cat tails. Her husband has no clue to her background until the state police show up at their door. To say he's pissed is an understatement. Dionne does a fabulous job of portraying Helena\u2019s childhood. To her, it's normal. As she says, if that's all you know you don't question it. Her mother never bonded with her, so it was towards her father that she was drawn. Even now, there is a true mix of emotions. Dionne does an excellent job of not just describing that blend of love and hate but making you understand it. She weaves the childhood memories with the insights Helena has gained through therapy. To say the writing is strong is an understatement. My hatred of the father was palatable. Helena only wants to capture him and return him to prison. I wanted her to kill him. Highly recommend this one. One of the best books I've read in 2017.

Helena grew up as the daughter of a high-profile kidnapper and his victim.

(What a cozy family, huh?)Years later, learning there has been an escape from the local prison, Helena instinctively knows that the manhunt is on for her father\u2026The Marsh King.

The character of the Marsh king is depicted in a frighteningly realistic way. Certain parts are monstrously brutal and difficult to read.

Putnam's Sons publication. Hypnotizing, thrilling, tense, and absolutely riveting!! I receive many emails from publishers and publicist promoting the latest book releases, but this book kept cropping up across different platforms, which piqued my interest. Then I noticed the rave reviews on Goodreads from trusted friends, and knew I had to see what all the excitement was about. Although I was eager to start the book, and carefully read the synopsis, I couldn\u2019t have possibly imagined the atmospheric pilgrimage, and adventure I found myself guided through. The upper peninsula is the perfect setting for this story, which is as much about survival in the wilderness as it is about the psychological abuse, and crimes committed by Jacob Holbrook. Helena was born into captivity, as her mother was kidnapped at the age of fourteen by Jacob, and forced to live way off the grid, in the marshland. Helena does not know her life is abnormal and sees Jacob has her father, not a monster who is holding them hostage. In fact, she seems to share a very special bond with the man, preferring him over her mother.When, at the age of twelve, Helena and her mother are rescued, and Jacob is sent to prison. Helena has a very hard time adjusting to civilization, but eventually marries and has two children. However, she keeps her past a secret from her family, until one day her worst fears are realized when Jacob escapes from prison, killing two guards in the process. Knowing she is the only person who can find him, Helena sets off in search of her father, geared with her special knowledge of how Jacob thinks. She bravely enters a \u2018deadliest game\u2019 type of situation with her three- legged dog as her only ally, barreling toward the ultimate showdown with her father, a man she both loves and hates. It will be survival of the fittest in an unbelievable and utterly absorbing mind game that will keep you right on the edge of your seat from start to finish. As Helena searches for her father, the story flashes back to her childhood, which goes into vivid detail about how her \u2018family\u2019 survived in the marshes, the skills her father taught her, and the psychological hold her father has over her. The author uses excerpts from the Hans Christian Anderson\u2019s version of \u2018The Marsh King\u2019s Daughter\u2019 as a prelude to each chapter, which contains a dose of symbolism that holds poignant meanings to the events taking place in the story. Her childhood is so deeply ingrained in her consciousness, loving the skills her father taught her and the stories he told her as a child, that she has a very hard time separating the monster from the father, she quite clearly loves. But, we also know it\u2019s a cat and mouse game and only one of them will walk away victorious. The struggle is physical, it\u2019s emotional, it\u2019s mental, and it\u2019s psychological. The beautiful nature is juxtaposed against the brutality of survival, which is often hard to digest. There are tense scenes of abuse, as well as cruelty to animals, and vivid hunting descriptions that are very disturbing and are difficult passages to read. Helena is a sympathetic character, which examines the long lasting effects of her isolation, the abuse she didn\u2019t really understand was abuse at the time, and the struggle to move forward, is harrowing, thought provoking, and sad, but she showcases an incredible amount of courage and tenacity, determined to do whatever it takes to save herself and her family. The author did an amazing job with this stark, realistic, fast paced thriller, combining elements of adventure with deep and profound emotional complexities, making Helena a heroine you will not soon forget."}, {"userName": "Book of Secrets", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3453249-book-of-secrets", "userReview": "Wow, wow, wow. I was riveted by this book, completely glued to the pages! THE MARSH KING\u2019S DAUGHTER was more than just gripping psychological suspense; it was also a compelling blend of literary fiction and unique coming of age story.This book tells the unusual life story of Helena Pelletier. She\u2019s a wife, mother, and small business owner, but at one time her life was very strange, and growing up she didn\u2019t realize it. The father whom she adored was actually a monster, a cruel psychopath who kidnapped her mother when she was a teenager. The three of them lived in an isolated cabin in Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula, completely cutoff from the rest of the world, until Helena was twelve years old. Now, after spending many years in prison, her father has escaped, and the only person cunning and skilled enough to track such as man is Helena herself.Helena\u2019s story alternates between the present as she hunts for her father, and the past when they lived alone in the marshlands. Moving between the two time periods bumped up the suspense. I was equally fascinated by both! As the reader, you already know that Helena will be separated from her father, but how? What was their life like before she knew the truth? What was it like for Helena to join the \u201creal world,\u201d and eventually be compelled to hunt him after his escape? My need for these answers made this a read-in-one-sitting situation!THE MARSH KING\u2019S DAUGHTER is a beautifully written book and a nail-biter at the same time. I loved it.

Her name is now Helena Pelletier, but she is also, even more so, the Marsh King\u2019s Daughter. And while the plot is suspenseful and the revelations make it a type of psychological thriller, it is the character development, revealed through the perceptive, evocative, and striking language of the author, that packs the biggest punch. For me, it read as a coming of age story, a child\u2019s growth to themselves, outside the boundaries of their parents\u2019 influence and control. As this is a crime novel, this path has a rather dark shade. Yet what the book is about is Helena\u2019s desire not to be defined by her father\u2019s actions and the label \u2018the Marsh King\u2019s Daughter\u2019 given to her by the voracious media after her escape. From her birth to the now, she tells us the story of how she was first made and how she remade herself, with the events in this book providing the final conclusion to her development.

Helena has a secret that she has been keeping for many years. She is the offspring of a kidnap victim and her captor. Helena has spent the first dozen years of her life living off the land, knowing nothing else. The isolation was something Helena suspected every child experienced, as she learned how to hunt, trap, and subsist without a lick of electricity. Now grown and having fled years in the past, her father sits in prison for his crimes, as the notoriety of the events has long since deflated. The reader learns of how Helena was forced to reinvent herself and acclimate to life in the world, surrounded by others with their social rules and expectation. She has a family of her own, but has not told them about her sensationalized upbringing in a similar community of Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula. When word comes out that her father has escaped prison, having killed two guards before fleeing into the woods, Helena has no choice but to tell her husband the truth. While he tries to waylay the shock he feels, Helena saddles him with the added news that she will not go into hiding with them, but has chosen to scour the woods for her father, in hopes of capturing him for the state troopers. What follows is a narrative that alternates between the present and Helena\u2019s struggles to locate her father, who has taught her everything she knew about these woods, and flashbacks to her growing up in an isolated cabin, having no idea that she was a victim of a heinous crime. Dionne pushes both stories along and shows the slow revelation that Helena made as she came to realize that the man she idolized was nothing but a sadistic control freak. As Helena tries to find her father, the past and present collide, forcing her to play a deadly game of cat and mouse, where only one will survive. Trouble is, both parties are prepare to hunt the other until all that remains is a bleeding corpse. Brilliantly paced and presented, fans across the board will flock to this piece that explores epiphanies and slow maturation with just the right amount of thrill factor to keep the reader guessing.Having never read any Karen Dionne previously, I was not sure what to expect. While reviews and \u2018currently reading\u2019 presence is strong for this book, I cannot always take the insights of others as my own. However, for the second novel in a row, I am pleased that I was pulled-in my the whirlpool of Goodreads popularity a novel has received. Dionne does an amazing job of using the blissful ignorance of young Helena to allow her to absorb all her father wants to teach her, only to turn the tables in the present-day manhunt that takes place to locate him. The reader can see growth in both incarnations of Helena, while also understanding the depth of her victimhood throughout the narrative. Dionne lays it all out on the table, allowing the reader to weigh in and determine if Helena was a victim or simply a product of her isolated upbringing. Adding numerous layers in the form of characters, real and imagined, the story takes on a new depth as the narrative bounced between both time periods. Dionne thickens the plot and the overall story by paralleling happenings in the novel with the fairy tale of the same name penned by Hans Christian Andersen many years before. Brilliant to be able to contrast and compare, as pieces of the tale appear to begin various chapters. The story has crumbs of uniqueness as well as the typical manhunt aspects, though the delivery is so flawless that the reader cannot help but feel drawn in until the final pages. Some will bemoan that the book is falsely labelled a thriller, but I think that if enough time is taken reflecting on the plot and the building narrative, it is clear that there are scores of thriller moments on which the reader can only posit where things will go next. Surely filled with research and dedication, Dionne has blown me away with the attention to detail in this piece. I cannot think of the last time I was so impressed by a story that is so simplistic and yet so complex at the same time.Kudos, Madam Dionne for offering up this idea. I will have to find time to read more of your work, as you are both a wordsmith and master of slow and steady plot development.Love/hate the review?

I wasn't sure how I could read it in a day along with the other things I had to do. Well once I started reading I couldn't put it down and everything else just waited. It became a very quick read for me. The Marsh King\u2019s daughter is a heart pounding, compelling, interesting and unique character driven psychological thriller. When we first meet Helena she is happy and living with her family but news that her convicted father has escaped from prison has Helena is a heart stopping game and race against time to stop her father from reaching her family.As Helena is racing against time we learn from flashbacks about her childhood being raised in captivity by her father. Innocent and naive, young Helena is oblivious to the fact that her and her Mother are being held captive. We see how she pieces together who and what her father really is. We see her go from adoring her father to realizing how controlling and evil he is and seeing how her weak cold mother is controlled by her father to understanding her Mother\u2019s love for her. Karen Dionne has created some compelling characters here that had me feeling very different emotions towards each. I loved Helena and her determination to stop her father. I felt sorry and heartbroken for her broken Mother and I loathed her Father. Just a heads up there is a hunting scene that I was unprepared for that was a bit disturbing and I didn't like that.The Marsh King\u2019s Daughter was a highly engaging, entertaining, fast paced race against time for me, that I am very glad I finished in time.

For those who enjoyed Jeannette Walls' memoir The Glass Castle, you too may fall for this book. **The audio version is now available for free from your public library, and the narration is absolutely outstanding.Upon overnight reflection, I'm bumping this to five stars and am putting it on my favorites shelf. EDIT: two weeks after the fact, I went ahead and bought a hard copy to keep! The fact that this contemporary and chilling story ties to an obscure Scandinavian fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen - and I won't say who it is that recalls that old fable to our protagonist - was just perfect. Absolutely perfect.The core story was completely believable and is a testament to the quiet courage of women who've been taken and survived. It shows the complex human psychology at work in a family unit and the glories of the natural world. Brutality is juxtaposed against beauty, and regret sings a single note that lasts for the entire novel.The story also features a character study of one of the strongest female leads I've run across in some time. She is human and fallible like the rest of us, but her true Achille's Heel is the love she holds for her narcissistic, violent father. And who among us didn't love Daddy at one time?The daughter of a sociopath grows up not having any clue that he is, in fact, a child-abductor and rapist. He treats the girl's mother - his captive for 14 years - like a slave while his daughter, a girl who is his spitting image, remains the apple of his eye. He is sadistic with the child, we come to learn, but she believes that she has earned punishment just as she sees her mother with the same learned disdain as her father. For now, I'm giving this 4.5 stars but may bump it up as the book settles in my mind. The daughter has a streak of Chuck Norris, MacGuyver, and just about anybody portrayed by Bruce Willis in a movie...it rather pulled me out of the story in distraction.Stillhouse Lake is a book I just finished for book club this week, and it too featured a woman whose loved one ended up being a killer. I'm not sure if this is some new trend in fiction, but as this beautiful and suspenseful book showed, that trend can be both touching and tense.Here is the link to The Marsh King's Daughter - the fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen.

Great book. I loved the main character, I thought of her as the woman version of Rambo. I was completely engrossed with this book. I immediately googled to see if this was based on a true story because it seemed so real."}, {"userName": "Phrynne", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne", "userReview": "I started this book last night after dinner, read it all evening, took it to bed and then could not go to sleep until I had finished it. That's what I call great suspense - there was no way I was going to put it down until I found out what happened!The story is told in flashbacks as Helena hunts down her appalling father in marshland in Michigan. Since it was her father who taught her her tracking skills there is every reason to fear who will find who first.This is a very original story, brilliantly told. The setting is beautifully described and the characters come alive as the story progresses. Even the father, who is basically a psychopath, shows moments of charm in his relationship with the young Helena.It is not an easy book to read. There are some really grim moments but they are necessary for bringing an awareness to the reader of the full horror of the father's character. A couple of bits however I skimmed.Altogether a very worthwhile read and one that lingers in the mind after it is finished."}, {"userName": "Margitte", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte", "userReview": "FROM THE BLURBThe suspense thriller of the year - The Marsh King's Daughter will captivate you from the start and chill you to the bone.'I was born two years into my mother's captivity. She was three weeks shy of seventeen. If I had known then what I do now, things would have been a lot different. I wouldn't have adored my father.'Sometimes, you know, I just don't want to say anything after reading a book. I just want to revel in my own speechlessness and ponder the experience. This is one of those times.This is an extremely atmospheric truth-seeking journey of the young Helena, who was forced to find the truth between two tales. The wisdom and teachings of her father, whom she adored, and the Hans Christian Andersen fairytale which her mother told her for a reason. When Calypso and Cousteau, two imaginary friends, entered her teen-life in the remote marshes of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan State, which was the only place she ever knew, the tales of the two parents changed colors and her subconscious began to recognize the lies in both tales. The two friends whom escaped from the pages of the fifty-year-old National Geographic magazines, would become the only two 'people' she could ever trust. The truth would appear many years later, when it was almost too late.Two worlds had to be negotiated to finally find that truth. In the one, Mrs. Helena Pelletier, wife of Stephen the photographer, had to sell homemade jams and jellies to survive, which her mother taught her to do in their lonely isolated cabin fifteen years earlier, and in the other, she had to find her way with the hunting and tracking skills her Ojibwa father, Jacob Holbrook, taught her. Somewhere between her mother's European ancestors and her father's Indian forefathers, Helene had to negotiate the truth. Facts were not always the truth. Sometimes the hunter becomes the hunted, but in Helena's case, the hunter made a mistake... she had two little daughters now, and nobody was going to harm Iris and Mari with her around ...Never underestimate the protective love of a mother...But what is love really? Love is so complicated, so confusing. She became the hunter.That's all I'm going to blurt out. :-)A magnificent read. Informative, entertaining, and thrilling. A MUST-READ, I would say."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9472704-linda", "userReview": "\"Some creatures just don't do well in captivity.\"Karen Dionne cracks the door open on a very, very dark tale that centers itself in a ramshackle cabin in the lowlying marshes of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. It is here that the reader pulls up a rickety old chair and sets awhile. The stilted words come tumbling out from Helena......slowly at first in guarded tones and then eventually reaching a thunderous crescendo.We watch Helena pace back and forth as she listens for sounds of her father's footsteps on the uneven floorboards of this cabin. Strange and questionable relationships present themselves. Jacob abducted a young fourteen year old girl and has held her captive for fourteen relentless years in that hell hole of an existence. Helena is the end result of that. Enter the Marsh King's Daughter.Dionne begins her story with Helena delivering her homemade jams and jellies to the local novelty stores. She is now married to Stephen, a photographer, and they have two small daughters. Our eyebrows raise in wonderment as to how Helena has escaped the confines of that terrible cabin and is now living a \"normal\" life. But nothing has been or will be normal for Helena. Not ever. Karen Dionne intersperses fairy tale excerpts between chapters. A clever attempt to swing from the dream-like state of these tales into the living nightmare that Helena and her mother endured at the hands of this psychopathic evil man. Reality for her mother was constant physical and mental abuse. Reality for Helena was no other parallels to lean against except for the traumas of her everyday life in Jacob's world.Let me caution you that this book will not be for everyone. I found myself cringing at certain points due to the graphic details. In addition, Helena will step forward as one complicated, tightly-wound young woman whose emotional issues lay so close to the surface. There will be times when you just shake your head in dismay at her actions. She is definitely a product of her circumstances.It was my wish that perhaps Karen Dionne would have led our girl Helena towards a pathway of attending to mental/emotional counseling at the end. That should have been part of the closure. Even a fictional character can create a world, contrary to the present one, where reaching out for help becomes the norm and not the exception."}], "description": "THE INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER\u201cBrilliant\u2026.About as good as a thriller can be.\u201d\u2013The New York Times Book Review\u201c[A] nail-biter perfect for Room fans.\u201d\u2013Cosmopolitan\u201cSensationally good psychological suspense.\u201d\u2013Lee ChildPraised by Karin Slaughter and Megan Abbott, The Marsh King\u2019s Daughter is the mesmerizing tale of a woman who must risk everything to hunt down the dangerous man who shaped her past and threatens to steal her future: her father.Helena Pelletier has a loving husband, two beautiful daughters, and a business that fills her days.
