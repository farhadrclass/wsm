Day captures the bleak Indiana wintertime landscape in the in these stories that are at times equally as cold and disheartening as the weather we've been enjoying, but they are so rich and well-articulated, she takes readers on a journey so tactile, it's as though you're walking among the circus people, animal barns and halted railroad cars in north central Indiana as they rest from a regular touring season. The interrelated stories span generations of families who lived in and worked around the fictional Wallace Porter circus in fictional Lima, Indiana. The circus is based on the real Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus, which really did winter in the real circus town of Peru, Indiana, where Day is from. Some of the stories are based on her family members' stories of their days of working in the circus. As each story introduces a new character's point of view, the overall story's dimension deepens, so that the whole book reads like a novel. Fans of \"Water for Elephants\" will love this book. Even if the circus or circus life doesn't appeal to you, circus literature will."}, {"userName": "Rebecca McNutt", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36977686-rebecca-mcnutt", "userReview": "Beautiful and evocative yet often not the glamorous facade the traditional circus entices with, this book will definitely be a favourite with fans of Water for Elephants.

The plot was interesting, sure, but this was more a book I wanted to get through to get to the other side, so I could interview the Ball State group working to turn its themes into a musical.Talk about a fantastic surprise to have discovered such a gem of short stories. Obviously these are all the more poignant to me since I'm a Hoosier (and Day herself grew up in Peru, Ind., the town not too far away from me that, at the turn of the century, was home to the very circus she based these stories on). What I didn't expect was how great the characters in each story would be \u2014 from Jennie Dixianna, the beautiful acrobat whose Spin of Death captivated audiences, to Hans Hofstadter, whose evil treatment of animals he cared for would backfire on him in the worst way, I loved every one of them. Rich, layered characters in stories that all, in some way, interconnected with one another in the crazy web that was circus life. It's obvious Cathy Day loosely painted herself as one (or more) of these characters, a female protagonist who longs to leave the tiny town she grew up in. But what I loved about her writing is how she didn't leave us with just a snarky/stark-y portrayal of our state. No, she brought the story full circle and it was in the closing chapter, with a passage that contained these lines, where I decided I loved this book: \"It's taken me a long time to figure out one very simple thing: The world is made up of hometowns. It's just as hard to leave a city block in Brooklyn or a suburb of Chicago as it is to leave a small town in Indiana. And just because it was hard to leave Linden Avenue in Flatbush or the Naperville city limits or Lima doesn't mean you can't ever go back.\""}, {"userName": "Lauren", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3548900-lauren", "userReview": "A series of interconnected short stories, this collection is more about a small town in Indiana than a circus. Yes, at one point in the town's history, the circus did winter there, but that hook is never given the space and room it deserves. Honestly, the premise could have been anything. There\u2019s nothing that makes the circus a necessity, which is a problem when that\u2019s the supposedly unifying element of a short story collection.As for the stories themselves, they\u2019re not bad. But they aren\u2019t great. I lived in Indiana for a few years, and other than a brief comment about the weather and how utterly depressing winter can be, there\u2019s nothing in the book that captures Indiana\u2019s unique character.Another problem, for me, was lack of character diversity (by which I mean personality). In the last story, there\u2019s a comment about there being two types of people: those who stay and those who leave. The Circus in Winter is entirely about people who want to leave (and in some cases, do leave). There\u2019s no attempt to get into the mind of someone who wants to stay, which leaves the stories as mostly being about miserable people who want to leave a small town, which once had a circus in it but doesn\u2019t anymore. It\u2019s not a bad read, but I was looking forward to stories about well, the circus in winter. I\u2019m not a fan of stories centering on dysfunctional small-town American life. People who do enjoy will probably enjoy The Circus in Winter. Fans of books about circuses should stay away.

The book is comprised of a collection of stories of several characters, whose stories all intertwine by the end of the book. (With the exception of one story, \"The Lone Star Cowboy,\" which only relates to a story near the beginning of the book.) I am in awe of how Day introduced each character and how each one impacts the lives of all of the others. Each story can easily stand on its own, which is refreshing in its own right.Overall, the stories are all very sad, very much depicting the realities of life and not those that you read of in other works of fiction. There is no main character, per se, but rather a town (Lima, Indiana) which is the focal point of the book. I am impressed with how Day developed each character's relationship with the town and how that affects each character's outcome. This truly is a wonderful book that I will recommend to many friends. Bear in mind, though, that this a very emotional read and that picking up this book will not, necessarily, be a walk in the park."}, {"userName": "Lynn", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2504930-lynn", "userReview": "I originally heard about this book while listen to NPR several years ago. The author read an exerpt from a chapter about a flood hitting Lima, IN. Lima is where the circus stayed in the winter. I was excited to finally find the book and was eager to read the other chapters. Day read a scene in which an elephant was seeking safety along side the house of a circus worker as the water continue to rise. The elephant had stretched its trunk up and into the house in an attempt to continue to breath and anchor itself again the water.But what started off as the tale of what happens to a circus when not traveling the country, turned into a historical overview of what happened after the circus stopped traveling and how intertwined the lives and legacies of the original circus crew was with Lima. As the story gets further and further away from the original group of characters, I grew tired of trying to figure out how they were all related and traced back to the start of the story."}, {"userName": "Jenny", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3334200-jenny", "userReview": "I might say four and a half stars actually.

It is so difficult to leave one's hometown and even more difficult to ever go back. I feel a connection to mine and at the same time know that I don't fit in there at all, nor would I ever want to.

This is a multi-generational story of a community of circus people who spend their winter downtown in Lima, Indiana.

It was probably one of the more depressing books I've ever read. I guess in a way that's understandable. Other books I've read on the circus such as Water for Elephants have highlighted what a tough life circus people actually live. There's a bit of glamour and glory but lots and lots of backbreaking work and deprivation in this way of life. I also had a hard time liking the many of the characters, no make that any of the characters. Other authors I've enjoyed more seem to make a hard life story enjoyable, not this author. What elevated it to three stars for me was learning about the history of a nearby small town, Peru, Indiana. Day did an excellent job of showing us the ins and outs of this unique Indiana small town. She also revealed the strengths and weaknesses of all such places, but seemed to dwell more on the weaknesses than the strengths.

The Circus in Winter is a series of connected tales about circus performers and their children and spans several generations in a small Indiana town called Lima where the circus winters at.

All the female characters are angry or bitter or both, and the only happy couple in this book happens to be the pinhead family. Everybody else is \"trapped\" in sad, dismal marriages. It gets a bit repetitive. I felt like the author's definition of circus and non circus folk was sort of silly. If you want to stay in one place- fine, but you'll end up bored to tears in a loveless marriage with a person who is as distant as the hills while your children shoot each other in the barn. Your other option is to be a circus wanderer, and be subjected to whoring, thieving, boozing, and death by strange accidents. Take your pick, sugar, cause either way the stories are a little more sad than vibrant. I like bittersweet, but I'd have liked a touch more of the sweet in here. I think the best of the book is the beginning, and the character Jennie Dixianna. After that there's just too many broken dreams and sorry ass relationships.

Covering a period of time that spans the late 19th century to the beginning of the 21st, the stories introduce us not only to people who are involved with the Great Porter Circus\u2014the owner whose wife dies early in their marriage (it happens early on, so this isn't much of a spoiler), the wife of the show's manager who has most rooms of their house painted with the artwork of various sideshow banners, and the clown who accidentally kills a fellow clown during a performance that goes awry, to name a few\u2014but also their descendants who may or may not remember the circus, which becomes a casualty of the Great Depression but whose legends live on.This is frequently a heartbreaking book; there is much sadness, loneliness, and bitterness among the characters, and the treatment of the circus animals\u2014generally peripheral to the plot\u2014is difficult to bear; a 1913 flood in the town that results in the deaths of many animals, including the big cats and one elephant who tries to survive, is a particularly upsetting chapter/story. Running like a thread through many of the stories is the case of Caesar, the bull elephant who kills his trainer; the extenuating circumstances and ultimate truth of this action are forgotten over time, although Caesar is still remembered in the town museum with a newspaper clipping about his ugly and wrongfully vengeful death that includes a photo of him, but also with an elephant skull that isn't his.Although I am no fan of circuses these days (although I loved the acrobats when I was a kid), I found this book affecting and its characters compelling and often sympathetic; winter\u2014a season I love\u2014is portrayed as another character, harshly living on the sidelines. Even so, whenever I read the words that end each circus performance, which also grace the tombstone of Ollie, the hapless one-time clown who is blessed at birth by the gentle touch of a circus elephant and whose mother is told that he will live to be a hundred (which he does...just), I found myself tearing up: May all your days be circus days."}, {"userName": "Phyllis", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30581424-phyllis", "userReview": "3 1/2 stars. This was a book I'm glad I read, but I was surprised that I actually finished it since I put it down more than once. A series of haunting interconnected short stories about a fictional version of the author's small town in Indiana, the overall mood is one of dreariness and depression. The book is written as if it is a true documentation of the lives of people who are either related or connected by the circus that winters in the town of Lima, Indiana, beginning in 1884 and ending in the present day. Having undertaken an enormous amount of research on the history of the circus, the author incorporates fictional characters seemingly stuck in this town, in the circus, and/or in their sad lives. I just happened to have read Truevine by Beth Macy last year, which is mostly a history of the origins of the circus from freak show to animals and acrobatic acts. Much of the circus background was familiar to me from Macy's book, which interestingly also has a pervasive feeling of sadness, mostly because of how the circus abused people by marketing them as freaks. The difference between the two books is vast. While Circus author Cathy Day has obviously researched the topic as well as Truevine author Macy, I found myself caring about Day's characters, even the elephants. They seemed so real while Macy's characters, who really did exist, were lost in the forest of facts and never seemed three-dimensional.Despite the depressing mood and unhappy characters, The Circus in Winter is uniquely and admirably written. Heartbreaking and dark.

It's so meticulously imagined, so perfect in its descriptions of \"domestic\" Midwestern life, that the setting of the circus town seems to blend in by the end of the book. That's not to say that the circus isn't the focus; I mean that it doesn't rest on this wonderful idea for a setting as a gimmicky plot device. It's the characters who are the most important here, and it's wonderful to see their varying degrees of attachment to the circus - what brought them to it, what they long for outside of it, what they sacrificed for it, and how it has defined them throughout their lives. Nothing about it feels cheap, and I can't help but think a lesser writer wouldn't be able to make the circus seem so perfectly and memorably real. This book is what Carnivale wants to be when it grows up.I'm curious how the stories would stand on their own - I found it hard to put down and especially liked the interconnectedness of the stories. It was great to see the way that the various flaws and triumphs of the characters' youths affected them when they appear as older characters in other stories. I find it difficult to pick a favorite, though I really enjoyed \"The Last Member of the Boela Tribe.\" I also really loved the \"This is what she wanted to say/This is what actually happened\" format - not overused, and effective when it was.

Because of the off-season theme, the stories are more about the people than they are about circus acts, though of course there is no way for many of these characters to ever be ordinary. Cathy Day very skillfully weaves a lot of things together here. For example, she follows the lineage of a family of faux African pinheads all the way from slave days, and shows how becoming a spear-shaking wild man for the circus paid much better than emptying so-called honeypots on a paddle boat.A lot of these characters long for something better that seems to elude them. From a clown who ends up running a dry cleaning store, to a rising baseball star who passes up a chance to play with a barnstorming team of all-stars in order to take over his parents' mortuary, to a disillusioned railroad worker who has to find a way to deal with the gypsy band that takes over the campground he has become manager of, they all dream of happier things, but rarely find them. One character is even drowned by his own elephant, and a lonely wife hires the circus painter on whom she has a crush to paint circus scenes all over the inside of her house.I really liked this series of stories, and although the lives portrayed don't usually go very well--like the clown who accidentally kills his clown pal by hitting him in the head with an ax--these tales are nonetheless highly readable and memorable.

The stories are not about the circus itself but about the people whose lives were connected in some way to it although some are very loosely connected. In fact, the narratives flow like a ripple effect. The first few chapters are about characters that interacted firsthand with the Porter circus and the following chapters drift further and further away from any direct link. Each story is cleverly crafted with twists or surprises that lure the reader to continue on reading chapter after chapter. One of the more unique stories is about the Jungle Goolah boy. This chapter is written through a combination of letters, telegrams, ledgers and newspaper clippings. This book is for the realist who wants to etch away at the gilded circus paint. It is no light-hearted, nostalgic homage to the circus but rather a grim portrayal of a culture that once employed dreamers looking for magic."}], "description": "From 1884 to 1939, the Great Porter Circus makes the unlikely choice to winter in an Indiana town called Lima, a place that feels as classic as Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg, Ohio, and as wondrous as a first trip to the Big Top.

Jennie Dixianna entices men with her dazzling Spin of Death and keeps them in line with secrets locked in a cedar box.
