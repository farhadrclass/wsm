I used to read her books when I was young finding them in my parents' used bookstore. Hill's books should be read in small doses. The sweetness becomes cloying after awhile. Having said that however, I must admit there are lessons to be found in them. As a Christian, it is good to be reminded of how a true Christian life looks and that my life continues to need some tweaking to be in alignment with that kind of life."}, {"userName": "Kristine Hansen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1952643-kristine-hansen", "userReview": "Lynette is clueless, absolutely clueless. Excited to be home from college, and ready to resume the romance with the same man she'd kind of been promised to in high school, she never took into consideration that her high school sweetheart would change.Maddening in that we spend most of the book on him, and not anywhere near enough time on Lynette, or on her fabulous journey (I really really wish I could have seen more of this...) we have what feels somewhat like a sermon on what happens when you let \"just a little bit of sin\" into your life. This book feels preachier than most, and that's saying something. But I love Grace's books, and I understand why she was writing them. We also have to understand the time period in which she's writing, and just what the threats of the day were. The very things she preaches against were things that were very shocking for the day - bare knees and shoulders, petting, going out to the movies for example. These are things which seem innocent, but when you take away the values, the faith, and even the foundation of Christianity, there is very little left to hold you up. It's no wonder Grace was concerned. Well-told, this story of course comes to a right and happy conclusion for those who deserve it. Maybe it reads a little like a melodrama straight out the silent movies (is that somewhat ironic?) but this is what entertainment was at the time, so maybe we can be a little forgiving in that regard."}, {"userName": "Bethany Mustafa", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2555118-bethany-mustafa", "userReview": "I actually really enjoyed this story. The other books I've read by this author have just been okay, but I really felt like she did a good job with the characterization in this one. The characters were a bit one-dimensional, but that really did make it easier to commiserate with certain aspects of the story. I sympathized with Lynette and experienced a genuine pain and shock right along with her when Dana Whipple, the young man she had always planned her future with, changed so drastically."}, {"userName": "Margaret Boehm", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3149954-margaret-boehm", "userReview": "Love this author."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/861743-melissa", "userReview": "I don't remember much, but I know it wasn't one of my favorites of GLH's books.

I didn't like about the book because I had to skip over some parts because it was just too much what I like about the book was that she came to herself realizing the man she loves all her life wasn't worth it but he was still conceited and to himself picking it was more than actually was and then her finding the man of her dreams that the Lord had promised her in the end."}, {"userName": "Denise", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1433045-denise", "userReview": "I forgot how good Grace Livingston Hill's books can be.
