I'm going to add my voice to this choir. The writing reminded me of problems I've had with some other YA novels. Everything is just a little too melodramatic, a little too overwritten, and a little too loud. The pacing is inconsistent; months will go by without much mention and yet events will be mentioned as if they just happened yesterday. There are countless contradictions within the text - I'd started off trying to remember some to mention as examples and quickly gave up. The main character's super power is healing, and yet he doesn't heal people close to him when the plot requires that they have an injury or ailment. There's a minor mystery involving murdered superheroes that never seems to be resolved, and then there's a surprise final villain that suffers from a lack of any foreshadowing that would make it believable. And then there's a complete lack of exploring themes that lend itself to the story - how about some musing on the parallels between an in-the-closet teen and a superhero with a secret identity?2.5 stars is probably a more accurate rating, since I enjoyed it and it was a quick read, but the problems made me wince so many times and I was completely frustrated that a great opportunity had been squandered."}, {"userName": "Dan", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1696807-dan", "userReview": "In Hero, author Perry Moore demonstrates a superpower of his own: he can turn prose into lead.Since Moore's intentions are admirable, it's tempting to gloss over the book's poor execution by praising it using plenty of qualifiers. (\"Hero is the best YA novel featuring a gay teen superhero I've read all month!\") Unfortunately, I just can't bring myself to use the words \"Hero\" and \"best\" in the same sentence. Well, in a pinch I could probably force myself to say, \"I read Hero while staying at a Best Western,\" but even that would be a lie.Moore's writing fails on every level. It lacks any poetry or spark--there's no life to it. I've read screenplays where the stage directions were written with more flair. The characters are bitchy and unappealing. (Bitchy characters are fine as long as they are also appealing.) The dialogue is pedestrian. The structure of the story is flabby. Even the superhero names are awful: Dark Hero...Golden Boy...Right Wing...Velvet Vixen...Galaxy Guy. And no, I'm not making these up.Moore has chosen to set his story in the DC Comics Universe. (For any non-geeks out there, DC is the company that publishes Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. If you don't know who those characters are, you're on your own.) It appears, however, that since Moore didn't own the rights to any of the DC characters, he avoided copyright infringement by making slight (extreeeemely slight) alterations to them. Presumably a lawyer advised him on precisely how much he needed to tweak each character in order to avoid getting sued. (\"No, Perry, Sooperman is still too close to Superman. Ditto on Supermann. What's that? Uberman, you say? Eh, good enough. Do I get paid now?\") I would have been fine with him satirizing established superhero characters, as the creators of Cerebus the Aardvark and The Tick did, but Moore isn't making any sort of commentary on the original characters. He is simply ripping them off.As I said earlier, Moore has admirable intentions. In mainstream comic books, on the rare occasions when gay characters have been depicted, well-meaning creators have unconsciously let their prejudices run wild. So, while it would never occur to them to show Spider-Man getting gang-raped, castrated, or impaled through the anus, give 'em a gay character and suddenly all of those storylines become strangely appealing. Moore published a list (click here to see it) detailing the grisly fates of various gay superheroes. He says he wrote Hero as a corrective to this shabby treatment, and in that limited arena he succeeds.If you're looking for a well-written YA novel about a gay teenager (albeit a non-superpowered one), I recommend Brent Hartinger's Geography Club."}, {"userName": "Tamora Pierce", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1451591-tamora-pierce", "userReview": "I'm re-reading, and it's even more enjoyable the second time than it was the first!"}, {"userName": "Punk", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/116652-punk", "userReview": "Young Adult. A gay teenager with superpowers and his disgraced hero-dad live together in the suburbs. They have their differences, but when Thom gets tapped to try out for the League (of superheroes) those differences threaten to tear them apart. Hee, sorry. It really is that dramatic. This book takes on a lot. It's got a solid story with a good array of characters. Kind of like a mix of The Incredibles and Sky High. A lot of the superheroes were just familiar DC characters with slightly different names, but there were some great original heroes like Typhoid Larry, who, as the underdog, was kind of my favorite. Superheroes are a given in this world, but gayness is not. And it's there I kept falling out of the story. The pervasive homophobia is so blatant and off-hand it's almost hard to believe. This is a world with superpowered aliens and queer is still bad? Even the ALIEN hates gays. I mean, come on. You can't ignore that superheroes are coded as queer -- they have secret identities and unexpected powers. It's a classic comics trope that if their true identities were ever to come out, it's their families that take the brunt of the attack. There's a ready made parallel for this in the book, but Moore doesn't take advantage of it, and that's my biggest problem. It's shortsighted to mix queer and superheroes and not connect them in some way; I was disappointed that Moore didn't even try.Two stars.

The foundation is this high school kid, Thom, coming to terms with his sexuality. So that's interesting on it's own, but then Moore adds a world of superheroes. Superheroes in this world don't always have special powers and being a superhero is a career(complete with a salary). Then there's Thom's home life with his single dad. Thom's parents are former superheros and his mom abandoned them a few years back. I really like this twist, it's really common to have the father figure doing the abandoning, so it was good to have a change of pace.

This story is set in the alternate world where Superheroes are a part of every day life, but puts a more humorous twist to it than many graphic novels. For avid readers of the Gay/YA fiction genre I would say that this book is a blend of Year of Ice, The Tick and the X-Men comic series. Thom Creed is a boy coming to terms with both his sexuality and burgeoning super powers \u2013 he can heal with a touch. His relationship with his father, a disgraced superhero, is further strained when a rival calls Thom a \u201cfaggot\u201d. Thom is later involved in an incident which brings him to the attention of the League, the union of the local super heroes and their lesser sidekicks and \u201cminor\u201d heroes. At League tryouts, Thom is paired with an assortment of superheroes: a demoted sidekick with super speed, a man who can make people sick, literally, a girl with pyrotechnic capabilities and anger management issues, and finally a elderly woman who smokes and \u201ccan see things\u201d. This team helps Thom get a better understanding of his place in the world, as well as how to better relate with his father and mysterious mother. The last half of the novel has Thom and the team battling an alien entity and resolving Thom\u2019s family and romantic situation.

Quite a few people I know had fangirled about it, so maybe I just expected too much from it. It's not a bad story, and I have absolutely no objections to young adult lit with gay characters -- my thoughts are yes please on that score. Writing-wise, though, the book just isn't that good. To me, it went by very very fast, despite the four hundred pages, and it didn't give me all that much to grab onto. That was kind of good when it came to the action scenes, but... Stuff like Ruth's death almost slipped by me because the story hurtles along at breakneck speed. The casualness with which Scarlett announces she might be pregnant makes me wince. Serious, important things just get skipped over.It wasn't all that original, really: all the superhero characters were basically the ones we all know, but with their names changed; I've read the same situations when it comes to coming out and being gay in a million stories online; and saving the world is saving the world is saving the world. The only really new thing was that Thom Creed is gay. That part actually kind of bothered me. Everyone in this book seems to know about Thom's sexuality even before he admits it aloud, and nearly everyone hates him for it. Neither of those things are even remotely realistic. I mean, I've known for five years at least that I'm bisexual, but in all that time, no one has ever just guessed my sexuality. It's not like we have it stencilled on our foreheads. And, strangely enough, not everyone in the world is homophobic. Okay, it's a book, it's fiction, it's not meant to be realistic, but... Perry Moore is gay himself, right? I can imagine that since he's openly so, he's had some of that experience, but I can't imagine that everyone in his world immediately condemned him because he's gay, because that's just not what happens.It also kind of made me wince when Thom's mother said that her career didn't matter because she had the man she wanted, and also at the way she dismissed any idea that Hal might be biased in thinking that she should give up her career because she's the woman and \"second rate\". I have no idea if Perry Moore realised how that scene would come across, but ouch.One thing I did like a lot was the relationship between Hal and Thom. I had no trouble believing in the way Hal treated his son and reacted to his various secrets, and I actually hurt for them both in a lot of their interactions.All in all, though, I wasn't really impressed. It's fun enough to read, and I hope it sets a precedent for books about gay characters, but I really didn't enjoy it as much as I was hoping to. I'm giving it three stars (\"liked it\") on goodreads, but I don't think, if I was basing that purely on how good the book is, it should get that much."}, {"userName": "Abby Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53329-abby-johnson", "userReview": "In a world where superheroes are real, Thom dreams about joining The League, a band of A-list good guys who protect the citizens of their fair city. He also dreams about one of the most famous (and dreamiest) superheroes, Uberman. Thom's keeping a lot of secrets, not the least of which is that he's got superpowers and has been invited to try out for The League. He knows his dad would flip if he found out. His dad used to be a hero, one of the greats. But then he was maimed in a catastrophic accident during a rescue mission that went terribly awry. Now Thom's dad is a pariah and blamed for hundreds of deaths. He's sworn off the hero stuff for good and Thom knows that there's no way he'd let him join The League. Throw in a zany cast of outcast potential superheroes, a dark stranger following Thom everywhere he goes, and a disappearing mom and you've got Hero. The book has issues to spare... family issues, abandonment, sexuality, and characters facing death every other day... Through it all, Thom is learning to trust who he is, to show who he is, and to see beyond the faces that everyone else shows the world. I really enjoyed this novel. It had a lot going on and it's a book you can really sink your teeth into. I loved the superhero world that Moore created.

In fact, it was overall a pretty derivative story and I doubt it would have gotten much attention at all (or even published) if not for the central theme, that Thom Creed, the title hero, has two \"secret identities,\" one as a superhuman, the other as a gay teenager whose famous ex-hero father is also a bit of a homophobe.I say \"a bit\" because of course this is a father-son novel and so by the end of the book, heartwarming acceptance amidst heroic self-sacrifice occurs, and Thom Creed is happily paired up with his handsome boyfriend (also a closeted superhero) in the brave new world they have just saved.For a gay teenager struggling with identity and acceptance and wanting to see someone like himself represented as a protagonist, this is probably a wonderful book. Me being old and cranky and cheerfully supportive of the whole Gay Agenda and anything else that makes bigots cry, I am glad books like this exist, but since I was mostly interested in the superhero story, I found it mediocre.

The fact he is developing powers is exciting to him, particularly when he gets the opportunity to try out for the \"league\", a law enforcement organization, of sorts, which is well-respected amongst the general population (unlike homosexuality). Unfortunately, he must hide his developing superpowers, and his sexuality, from his father- who strongly disapproves of both. Written with a wry, but subtle humor, this story was a nice blend of fun imagination and an individual coming to terms with who he is. Combined with that are the standard struggles of coming out, family trials, and aspirations to be part of something greater. Love is certainly involved, but the theme of familial love and acceptance is stronger than romantic love, which, while present, takes a backseat here.

Most of Moore\u2019s characters are thinly veiled versions of Marvel and DC characters, such as Warrior Woman (Wonder Woman), Dark Hero (Batman), American Agent (Captain America) and Justice (Superman). This book even gives most of the characters a similar origin as their counterparts with very little deviation. I think some readers may find that annoying and lacking imagination, but I thought that was a great in the same way that Garth Ennis\u2019 The Boys was great for doing that. It\u2019s meant to be a satirical comment on heroes, even the names are comical.More importantly, the All-Father Stan Lee gave the foreword, not that I believe for one second he actually read this book because I\u2019m cynical like that.Thom was an character that didn\u2019t annoy me. He\u2019s a good kid. His family life is difficult, so he tries his best to help his dad in any way he can. I did think that Moore might\u2019ve went a little overboard in the beginning with Thom having so much on plate with sports and his two jobs along with school. It was nice to read a YA where the kid wasn\u2019t whining for twenty straight pages about inconsequential shit, though. Yes, I know kids do that, but Thom seemed act mostly appropriate for the type of life he\u2019s led with his father. This is YA, so there was plenty of melodrama, but I find that YA books with male protagonists are much less histrionic than many YA books with female protagonists. It had it\u2019s moments with the romance, but even Thom\u2019s growing interest in another character doesn\u2019t overwhelm the book. It remembers that it has a plot unlike many other YA books who seem to think they have a romance and everything else is filler.Thom is initially paired up with a surly girl named Scarlett who controls fire, one of the A-listers that got demoted to their team leader, a speedster named Golden Boy, Typhoid Larry who can make people sick with a touch, and the best character, Ruth, an old woman with a fondness for smoking and a raspy cigarette voice who predicts the future. Thom\u2019s team truly are D-listers with substantial issues that they\u2019re dealing with from health conditions, old regrets, esteem issues, to identity crises/abandonment issues. When one character explains why he he adores Thom\u2019s father\u2013when Thom expresses skepticism that anyone revered his father\u2013 he says :\u201cYour dad was the only hero who knew what it was like to grow up in an orphanage. He knew what it felt like, not being wanted [\u2026] Your dad made it out, and he didn\u2019t even have a super power.\u201dThat punctuated for Thom that heroes aren\u2019t just heroes because they have a super power, but because they represent something for someone; they have made a lasting impression on someone\u2019s life. With his team, he learns empathy, which in turns helps his powers and actually makes Thom focus less on himself. Thom\u2019s personal worries are understandable, but this book allowed him to grow a little and learn that mastering his powers meant learning to see beyond the facades that people put up to protect themselves, to think beyond more than just himself. I also liked that Moore had a concept that powers came with consequences, consequences that a hero may or may not be able to control. Thom\u2019s conundrum was \u201cWhere did all the pain go that he took from others?\u201d However, this didn\u2019t seem to be consistent over the board for inexperienced heroes.Thom had many things going on in his life, and because his problems were so numerous, I knew that parts of the plot were going to have to suffer. You don\u2019t get all the problems that Thom has and expect everything to wrap up neatly in just this short time frame. There were parts of the story that lacked cohesion and could be too predictable at points. There was all this mystery into the big reveal for Dark Hero\u2019s identity, but if you don\u2019t figure out who it is well before you get to the ending, then it will be a sad day in Mudville. While I didn\u2019t mind all the characters basically being comic book characters we already know, I wish there\u2019d been a little more originality to the story and what he did with these caricatures of them. My biggest complaint is the ending, though. I felt there was very little foreshadowing for that. You get just a tad bit of a hint that something is off, but not enough to see that coming at you. Once it happens, though, you\u2019ll probably be left thinking, \u201cWhy am I not surprised?\u201dWhile I certainly applaud Moore for choosing to write this story about a gay, male superhero, this is part of where his story lacks, as well. A large part of the story dealt with Thom\u2019s fear of his dad finding out he\u2019s gay, especially since he harbors a painful memory of his father going on a homophobic rant when he was a child. Instead of having Thom\u2019s dad come to terms with his son\u2019s sexuality through interaction, Moore uses the old clich\u00e9 that Thom\u2019s dad always knew he was gay and just skirted around it, tried to pretend it didn\u2019t exist. There\u2019s never any real discussion about Thom\u2019s sexuality between father and son. There\u2019s just acceptance after his dad spent most of the book making pointed statements like, \u201cWe\u2019ll find the right girl for you.\u201dHowever, I was glad that Thom knew he was gay. What I mean, there\u2019s no questioning or any reasoning that maybe something was wrong with him. Thom is gay. Thom has never had a girlfriend because he\u2019s never been attracted to girls or even seemed to want to experiment with them. Thom accepted who he was and didn\u2019t try to be anything other than that. He wasn\u2019t \u201cout\u201d for most of the book, but there was never any question of what he considered his sexual orientation. I\u2019m not demonizing books that do have young adults questioning their sexuality, but sometimes, it\u2019s nice to see a young adult who is confident enough to say, even if it\u2019s only to himself, \u201cThis is who I am. There is nothing that will change that.\u201d His struggles with his sexuality stemmed from embarrassing his father and trying to keep his orientation hidden from others as he\u2019s not ready to be out yet. He never directly denies any allegations thrown at him about his sexuality. He simply doesn\u2019t engage, and that\u2019s a very plausible response.Narration wise, Michael Urie was phenomenal. His voicing of Ruth was by far my favorite. He caught that smoker\u2019s voice well. Ruth was probably my favorite character in the whole book too. She was a tough hold broad who wasn\u2019t afraid to read people the riot act, but she cares for her misfit team. I\u2019m definitely interested in see what else Urie has narrated. He made this story fun.Overall, a great concept and a great read despite it being too ambitious with its plot points. It definitely made the superhero fan in my happy. Now, if I could just stop humming that Spider-Man song \u201cHero,\u201d I\u2019d be really happy. I woud\u2019ve loved to have seen more of this story, but tragically, Moore died in 2011.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQzn4a...Now, it\u2019s stuck in your head too."}, {"userName": "Tokio Myers", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28412182-tokio-myers", "userReview": "[ By the by I am so glad he got with \"Batman\" cause if I was writing a DC fic I'd write about how I got with \"Batman\"  (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Steven", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2067702-steven", "userReview": "Huh. What to say about this novel.It's always difficult for me to write a non-biased review of something. My own politick and views and issues come to play at pretty much everything I do, and separating them can be difficult quite often.So it shouldn't come as a surprise when I say I have some major issues with this novel. As a superhero novel, it works pretty damned well. Thom Creed is a teen just discovering his superpowers, who believes he can change the world for the better. He discovers himself to be a healer, and he uses his power rather effectively, but encounters a very Doug Ramsey problem with his powers. How do you function on a superteam, in the midst of a battle, when your power is to heal other people? Especially when you're out to impress the man of your dreams, who happens to be a super-strong, loved by everyone, flying hunk of bear. And dumb as a rock, but that's not the point. The wrestling with the nature of his powers--not only his own, but the reactions of the other characters--and the way he explores them are fascinating to read, really. A little Gary Stuish sometimes, but overall it works and it keeps you interesting. And while the superhero plot is more than a little transparent, it still works and it keeps you interested. You may know the villain as soon as it appears, but it still manages to be a threatening, suspenseful ending.It functions well as a superhero novel. It's not one of the greatest superhero stories in existence, but it isn't bad. It's readable and entertaining, especially as a young adult book.And now comes the part where I talk about what I don't like. And really, where to start.I'd like to preface this by asking this of my fellow Queers: Are we not, as a people, a culture, a movement, past this story? I'm going to be the last person to say that this abandonment anxiety isn't a valid fear in us, especially in our youth. There are still parents who try and instill bigotry in their children, who create an environment where to come out of the closet is to give up on family affection. There are so many of us, those who have lived this scenario, those who are living it, and those who still may, who have this pain and need to share it to move on.But what are we doing with this pain? We can lay it out on the table, we can expunge this hurt, but that doesn't make it go away. And having this anxiety play a major role in our young adult novels isn't helping. It's instilling this fear in those who don't feel it already. It justifies this need to be accepted, which we all possess.But isn't it about time that we faced this fear? That we said, \"Yes, I want acceptance from my family and peers. But if I don't have it, then I'm still going to be fine.\"? Rather than telling queer youth reading this novel that the fear is justified, shouldn't we be helping to quell it? Shouldn't we be there to say that yes, it may happen, and if it does, you are still loved? When the main character of this novel tries to express his feelings of abandonment, he's told to reach out to those who've let him go. To the purposefully ignorant, disapproving father, he should show respect because at least he has a father. To the abusive, vitriolic teammate, he should find out why she's hurting, help her heal herself, to help her love herself that she can love him. He isn't allowed to feel anger at the abuse and neglect he faces. He has to be the better person. He has to rise above it. He's never even given the option of a second support system. There are no other gay characters to whom he can look up to--even his love interest comes across as rather despicable for a good portion of the novel. The support system he does build rejects him out of hand when his secret is exposed, and he's given nowhere to turn. Where are we as a people in this novel? Where are the LGBTIQ youth centers? Where are those of us with an interest in your youth? We're never present in this novel. We're never around to offer another family. We shouldn't encourage our youth to completely turn their backs on those who reject them. We're never going to really win acceptance by doing that. But we are a people. We are a culture. We are a movement. We are here to say that even if your family turns their back on you, you are still loved. You are still cared for. We are here for you. Isn't it time we showed that in our young adult novels? That even if that fear IS justified, as for many it is, there are still options? We've had our time to express our pain. Now let's use that pain, and make it something good. Otherwise, it's never going away.The book comes to a positive message by the last third, and though it's full of cliches, it's well-written for what it is. Had Thom Creed never found his own strength to accept--and love--himself, this book wouldn't have earned one star. As it is, I give it three. It's readable. It's entertaining. And it's heart is in the right place. Now it just needs to get its head there too."}, {"userName": "Kris", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2609109-kris", "userReview": "The Review:Honesty from the outset~Yes, it's my first 5 stars. *rolls eyes* Get over it, people!First things first~(I think) Tam mentioned this book to me when we were talking YA a couple of months ago and then in another discussion a so-called friend described it as being 'FANF*%KINGTASTIC' and very helpfully provided me the link to a bookstore which not only had the paperback, but also free global shipping to Australia. (Damn you, Sean Kennedy!) Well, who could resist??Thom Creed is not a typical teenager by any stretch of the imagination. His father, Hal Creed, was one of the greatest superheroes of his generation, but after being blamed for a tragic accident became an outcast. Soon after, Thom's mother disappeared leaving his father devastated and Thom increasingly determined not to cause any further pain to the person who has been the one constant in his life. Circumstance and, I think, Thom's natural inclinations make him a loner, who is careful to keep his distance from others and to guard his own secrets. The first of these being that he's gay and the second his newly discovered super powers and invitation to join the League that ostracised his father; both of which he knows will be of great disappointment and sorrow to Hal Creed.Hero is Thom's coming of age story. I became very quickly engrossed in Thom's journey as he struggles with his secrets, the reality of the world of superheroes, the meaning of friendship, the growing feelings he has towards a certain boy, and, in my opinion, most importantly, his relationship with his father. It was the latter that resonated the most with me and truly made this an unforgettable story.Why did I like this aspect so much? I think it was because it was so extraordinarily moving. Many of us can relate to dealing with issues such as acceptance with parents or other family members. In Thom's and Hal's case these problems are exacerbated by their personal situations: their inherent wish to be honest and open with each other; their unwillingness to cause hurt and hesitancy to take that first step; the concern and shame both feel about what happened to Hal and consequently to the family; their pride in the Hal's former life as a superhero; their desire to help people; and, above all else, their love for each other. All of these themes and issues came through so evocatively in Hero and the majority of them the reader is privileged to explore through Thom as he discovers and begins to comprehend his and his father's past, present and future.Although I was charmed by Thom and found his journey a bitter sweet one, it was the character of Hal who I found particularly poignant. He was tragic and flawed, but strangely heroic. His prejudice towards homosexuals was made clear from the start of the book and this obviously influenced Thom's secrecy about his sexuality; however, there was no doubt that he loved his son. There were two scenes towards the end of the book that broke my heart. Even typing this I have a tear in my eye so be warned that you may need to keep a hankie handy.Finally, and because some people are sure to want to know ;), Hero is beautifully written from the first person POV with an outstanding, engaging and well crafted cast of characters and an excellent plot. Be sure to set a good length of time aside as it will keep you turning the pages until the very end.A couple of issues/warnings~This is not a 'and the Daddy and Mummy got back together, Daddy regained his place in society, after some minor concerns the Daddy and Mummy accepted their son Thom was gay, Thom found the boy of his dreams, and they all lived happily ever after and saved the world (a number of times), the end' kind of a story. If that's what you're expecting because it's YA or a superhero story, take your bat and ball and run along home... and may you live the rest of your lives with the niggle that you have missed out on a truly awesome read. Amen.My recommendation~This is a must read.Oh, all right. This is a must read for all those of you who want a 'FANF*%KINGTASTIC' story. At the very first opportunity, I will be re-reading it. It was a fabulous experience."}], "description": "The last thing in the world Thom Creed wants is to add to his father's pain, so he keeps secrets. Like that he has special powers.
