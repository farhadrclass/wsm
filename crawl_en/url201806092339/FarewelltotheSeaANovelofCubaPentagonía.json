It is written in a kind of stream-of-consciousness that made it very hard to read. It jumps around from the couple vacationing (though in humble circumstances) at the beach with their infant, the husbands erotic homosexual fantasies, and discontent with the Cuban system, government and regime. As this is almost 500 pages long, after 75 pages I gave up. The writing style was hard to fathom and the subject matter while familiar, too elusive. Life is too short for some books."}, {"userName": "Mariane", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/804620-mariane", "userReview": "After reading Before Night Falls, I had to read all of his books.

Divided in two parts, the first part is the stream-of-consciousness narrative by the unnamed woman who resents her baby, fears losing her husband, and who feels helpless to cope with the communist society in Cuba. She aches for her husband's love, yet is suspicious of his infidelity, particularly when a handsome and taciturn teen-aged boy arrives with his loquacious mother and moves into the cottage next to theirs. Her dreams are mixed into her daily conscious narrative and reveal her anxiety, torment and fears. In one dream with sexual connotations, she sees visions of Greek warriors slaughtering each other in a violent orgy-like battle. And in another vivid rendition of the ubiquitous cue of the communist life, Cubans stand morosely in line while soldiers stand nearby, gunning down anyone that dares defies them or attempts to alter the cue.The second part is from the husband's, Hector, perspective, but it's primarily told in poetic form and involves often allegorical portrayals of how he sees Cuban life and his own. His resentment underscores much of his tale, even his attraction to the boy next door, which becomes a central conflict during his stay. He longs for the boy and to freely express his homosexuality, yet feels the omnipresent oppression of the communist system as it systematically stifles all that is human. Perhaps one of the most poignant passages is the following poem in which Hector expresses what the communist system has done to his and everyone else's humanity: \"You are no longer a man who calls things by their name -- you blaspheme. You are no longer a man who laughs -- you jeer. You are no longer a man who hopes -- you mistrust. You are no longer a man who loves -- you accept. You are no longer a man who dreams aloud -- you are silent. You no longer sleep and dream -- you are sleepless. You are no longer one who is wont to believe -- you consent. You are no longer a seeker -- you hide.\" And then he adds the line (not 30 yet) to signify how communism has jaded him and turned him into a hopeless cynic while still a young man.Beautifully written, and a tale that will bear repeated readings."}, {"userName": "Simon Davis", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17878979-simon-davis", "userReview": "Farewell to the Sea has the deepest, most prolix relationship with the ocean of any book I've ever seen. It is the book you would give someone who had never seen the ocean, if you wanted them to understand what it feels like to be near, to be in and to be surrounded by the sea. To see the sea in this novel as a metaphor, symbol, whatever, is to belie the endless intrusion of the ocean as an actual character in the novel, albeit one who is silent and ever-present. The way the sea is addressed is expectedly quite different when described by the anguished poet Hector or the nameless wife--the former has a relationship with the sea based on its eternal qualities, while the latter seems to use the sea as a calming, meditative environment to escape the anxiety of her marriage, her mother, and the political environment of 60s Cuba. That anxiety is well characterized by the constant stream of disorganized thoughts that come from her, thoughts which only seem to organize around a coherent theme during her allegorical fever-dreams, which revolve around violence and aggression but nonetheless tell of a more pure emotion than the constantly changing concerns of a new mother with a baby, dominating mother, and husband with his iron in another fire. It's unsurprising she finds such a queer solace in dreams, given the quality of her waking life and its propensity to exploit her insecurities."}, {"userName": "Jos\u00e9", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15065815-jos", "userReview": "\u201cA\u00fan entre el aire y el muro que se nos abalanza puedo ver, otra vez, el mar.\u201dEl tercer libro en la pentagon\u00eda de Arenas, la primera parte es cronol\u00f3gica, estructurada, narrativa y sigue los pensamientos de una mujer an\u00f3nima.

I also liked the idea of reading fiction written after the revolution in Cuba. And the fact that the book was disappeared, confiscated, and finally smuggled out and published in Barcelona was a real draw. I liked the first half better than the second half, although while I was reading the first half, I was hoping the second half would be better. [spoiler alert - next paragraph]First half - I got used to the presentation of events as non-linear, so that the drive to the beach took place at the same time as the [spoiler alert] runaway during the pregnancy and the [spoiler alert] death of the young man. But the repetitive long references to dinosaurs was tedious, as well as the long recitation of dreams. (The good part is that reading these dream sequences conjured for me a perfect picture of Nathan Englander at the Sixth & I Synagogue at the release of his excellent short story collection, What We Talk About When We Talk About Anne Frank, explaining advice someone gave him - \"No one wants to read about your dreams. No one wants to read about your characters' dreams.\" The point being: If you have something to say, just say it.) I think this book might be good for people who have nothing to do and wish they had a long rambling book to read aloud slowly, so as to take up some time. Second half - rant, diatribe, tirade, some in poetry form. I prefer storytelling. There were some glimpses of life in a work camp, dissatisfaction with the leader of the revolution (monster), and passages showing the corruption power permits, even for revolutionaries. Plus lots of passages about sex that weren't sexy - maybe they were about how the monster ravages the people. Can't wait to go to book group on Saturday and let the others explain this book to me."}, {"userName": "Chris Garcia", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/187948-chris-garcia", "userReview": "This was unreadable. First half: neurotic stream of consciousness. Second: pissed off free verse. Themes: 1: \"Oh, is my husband gay? I hope not!\" 2: \"Oh, why do we have to live in Cuba?\"Good points: I don't know. It was just a prolonged neurosis/rant. The structure of the free verse was elegant, but the repetitions (\"Quick, the blah blah blah. Quick, blah blah blah. Quick!\") and double columns felt dated. Grotesque flights of fancy were refreshing but often dragged on pointlessly. However, a Burroughsian passage featuring a gay monster named Eachurbod was exquisite, unselfconscious, and entertaining, unlike the rest of the book.I started reading it because I was thoroughly moved by the movie Before Night Falls. When I realized it was bad (sadly, it is considered the best of Arenas' penta-something), I decided to plow through anyway because 1) I didn't want to be a quitter and 2) I wanted to work through my impression of Latino literature as a bit, uh, precious.A word on that. I'm exploring it. I hear people rave about Latino literature all the time. I trust them. So I'm working on my prejudice, or insensitivity, or ignorance, or whatever. Unfortunately, this book did not help me in that work, but I haven't given up on Latino literature, and Arenas' Before Night Falls and Hallucinations are still awaiting judgment. However, since they're by the same author, I'm not going to force myself to read them. I'll just give up on him and move on to Garcia Lorca."}, {"userName": "Robert Wesley", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5949429-robert-wesley", "userReview": "THE TIDE IS HIGH \"I'M GONNA BE YOUR NUMBER ONE\" MY FAVORITE NOVEL is Farewell to the Sea by Reinaldo Arenas A Cuban farm boy, the author, from whose memoir he describes himself as a primate \"wild child\" struggling and failed to communicate to his machismo father. Began at age six engraving lines of poetry into their lands tree and inadvertantly infuriating his father's sensibility. The superb English translations of Reinaldo Arena's works include the novel Farewell to the Sea. It is a symphonic talmudic - like orchestra of words; singing through my mind; passages rose above the page like angels. I saw through the author's eyes a existential familial struggle between land and the gateway of Castro's Cuba politics to seal a young man's masculinity. The most unforgettable deliverance and symbiosis ever has a tale stirred my inner astrolabe to humanity's potential to experience heaven on earth."}, {"userName": "Frankie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/853659-frankie", "userReview": "my favorite of arenas', and the 3rd book of his \"pentagonia.\" a gay man and his sham wife on their vacation spend a week at the beach, drained by the charade of communist cuba's labor camps. arenas' poetry at its most vibrant."}, {"userName": "Mark Field", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6272592-mark-field", "userReview": "Although I struggled initially to get into this I have to admit that by the time I got to the second part, I continued reading until I had finished the book!Beautiful and poetic throughout it was a wonderful read."}], "description": "In this brilliant, apocalyptic vision of Castro's Cuba, we meet a young couple who leave the dreariness of Havana and spend six days at a small seaside retreat, where they hope to recapture the desire and carefree spirit that once united them.
