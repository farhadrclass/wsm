A: Someone\u2019s rape fantasy.Goddamn it. Look, I\u2019ll admit, I went into this book expecting to loathe it. I hate-read every time I hit a book slump because it\u2019s the only way for me to get out of one. But I in no way expected to be this enraged. Let\u2019s start with the plot, shall we? The MC\u2019s brother rips off a biker gang and she\u2019s forced to become one of their sex slaves in order to save his life. Yup, that\u2019s the fucking plot. Oh, but it\u2019s not rape. She has a choice, you see. She can choose not to become a sex-slave\u2026but then they kill her brother. You heard it here first! Forced sex through coercion isn\u2019t rape! Tell all your friends! \u201cYou want to keep dumbass alive, pack a bag and climb on my bike when we leave. You do what I tell you, when I tell you, no questions and no bitching.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked blankly.\u201cWhy the hell do you think?\u201d he said, voice strained. \u201cSo I can fuck you.\u201dBUT IT\u2019S NOT RAPE.\u201cThis pussy is mine. You are mine. I\u2019ll fuck you when and where I want, and you can either take it or get the fuck out. Are we clear?\u201dBUT IT\u2019S NOT RAPE.\u201cYou do this, it\u2019s your choice. I\u2019m not raping you. You\u2019re making a decision to pay for your brother\u2019s mistake on your back. You get me?\u201dSEE? IT\u2019S NOT RAPE!Me:This epic piece of shiterature contains possibly the single worst female lead that I\u2019ve ever had the misfortune to read about, Marie. This chick is a horrifying amalgamation of every complaint I\u2019ve ever had about every female lead I\u2019ve ever hated all rolled into one INSANELY FUCKING STUPID package. I can honestly say that reading about this chick was like sitting in a room full of misogynistic men and listening to them tell me all the reasons that they hate women. She is the most stereotypically offensive female ever. AND NO, I\u2019M NOT FUCKING EXAGGERATING.The book opens with her leaving her husband because he hit her. She then goes on to slut shame the woman that he\u2019s currently sleeping with. \u201cI liked to think of Misty as THE WHORE, which I wrote in all caps for all emphasis whenever I texted someone.\u201dLet\u2019s just ignore the \u201call emphasis\u201d portion of that sentence. This book is horribly written and edited, end of story. Instead, let\u2019s focus on the definition of the word whore: \u201ca woman who engages in sexual acts for money.\u201d Does this woman exchange sex for money? No. So definitively, she isn\u2019t a whore. She\u2019s a \u201cwhore\u201d in Marie\u2019s mind because she\u2019s sleeping with her ex. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS THOUGHT PROCESS? Instead of feeling sympathy for this woman, instead of wanting to warn her away from what will likely be an abusive relationship, you slut-shame her?! HE FUCKING HIT YOU! WHY ARE YOU ANGRY THAT HE\u2019S WITH SOMEONE ELSE AT ALL?! SHOULDN\u2019T YOU BE ELATED THAT YOU ESCAPED?!Way to be completely fucking brainwashed by society, way to UNINTENTIONALLY be the perfect fucking victim, way to continue this god-awful trend of women hating other women for no fucking logical reason, way to be a fucking bestseller and continue to perpetuate these stupid fucking trends to the masses. It gets worse, by the way. Marie walks into her house to find her brother nearly beaten to death and a bunch of leather-bound men standing over him, one of which holds a gun to the back of his head. Any decent human being\u2019s reaction to this: Marie\u2019s reaction to this: \"My brother knelt in the middle of our crappy living room, bleeding and awaiting execution, and all I could think about was me and Horse. What the hell was wrong with me?\"Everything. I hate you. I hope that the bike you\u2019re about to ride on crashes and you\u2019re caught beneath it and slowly burn to death, you horrible excuse for a character. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re thinking that goes too far, that it\u2019s a little too much. NO. IT\u2019S NOT NEARLY ENOUGH. I HAVE ALL THE RAGE THAT HAS EVER RAGED.Before I burst a blood vessel, why don\u2019t we move on to Horse, the male lead? Yup, his name is Horse. Because he\u2019s hung like one. Mmm, sexy, huh? Um\u2026no. A horse\u2019s penis can be anywhere from 2.5 \u2013 3.5 feet long. The average woman\u2019s vagina is 3-4 inches deep but can expand to 200% when fully aroused. Let\u2019s say Marie has an above average vagina and is packing 6 inches of un-aroused heat. Fully expanded that\u2019s still only 12 inches, a full foot and a half short, AT LEAST. I\u2019m sorry ahead of time but all I can picture is this: Horse is one of the men that just beat the shit out of her brother. Does he seem remorseful? No. All he seems to be concerned with is Marie and her vagtastic va-jay-jay. He couldn\u2019t give a fuck about killing a man. Mmm, sexy, huh? *pukes*JFC, what is it with all these tattooed ragebeasts? Why are they a fucking thing? Are we that unevolved? If you\u2019re a troll, don\u2019t even bother answering that, it was rhetorical. This book\u2019s popularity is all the answer I need.So back to the matter at hand. Marie\u2019s in a bit of a bind. What does she do about it?A)\tCall the copsB)\tMake an excuse to leave the room and call the copsC)\tAgree to their demands only until she has a chance to call the copsD)\tHappily agree to be Horse\u2019s sex slave and never once thinks about calling the copsIf you answered D, congratulations, you\u2019re correct! I don\u2019t have a prize to give out but saving you from reading this failmance seems pretty good to me, so you\u2019re welcome for that. Marie\u2019s agreement leads us to the final thing I\u2019d like to talk about; Marie and Horse\u2019s abusive abusive relationshit. Let me set the scene for you concerning their fist sexual encounter. Marie wakes up in bed, having no recollection of how she got there. Someone has stripped her down to her panties and tank top. Behind her, a boner. For whatever reason, this isn\u2019t an issue for her and she starts to fool around with \u2013 God, I can\u2019t even believe I\u2019m typing this \u2013 Horse. Then this happens: \u201cI shivered, lust and desire bursting through me, trying to see if I could lift my hips and move with him. In the process I accidentally pushed against his chest, which he apparently interpreted as me trying to push him away.Horse pulled away from my mouth and growled, eyes dark with desire and a need so strong I froze. He looked like an animal in heat, a point his hard prick seemed to be determined to impress in its own way.\u201cI\u2019m in charge here, don\u2019t forget it,\u201d he stated.\u201dThat\u2019s right. He thinks she\u2019s trying to push him away and he doesn\u2019t respect that. Instead, he gets forceful with her. Marie, being the fucking idiot that she is, is fine with this. He then goes on to shove a finger up her ass without warning and then when his buddies walk into the house and she refuses to have sex with him because she doesn\u2019t want them to hear her, he punches a hole in her wall, slams her door so hard that he cracks the wood, and walks out on her. She goes on to obsess about him. So I\u2019m sorry, I know a lot of people were enjoying my updates but I just can\u2019t with this fucking book. Blurring the lines when it comes to sexual assault is not something that I enjoy. Reading about sorry excuses for women is not something I enjoy. Reading about an emotionally abusive relationship is not something I enjoy.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest"}, {"userName": "Blacky *Romance Addict*", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8310179-blacky-romance-addict", "userReview": "Horse is in the house!And he's badass!

I loved it HARD![no pun intended\u2026*giggles*]Reaper\u2019s Property is a must read if you enjoy hot alpha-males, bikers and a whole lot of crude and hard! Wink, wink! In all seriousness, I was pleasantly surprised that I ended up loving this book as much as I did. Not only was it sexy and steamy, it was also well-written and funny.Marie Jensen has finally left her abusive ass-hat of a husband and is living with her brother, Jeff, in a trailer. Jeff is doing some work for The Reapers, a motorcycle club that is dominant in the area. Marie meets some of the Reapers when they pay a visit to her brother to discuss business, one of the bikers she meets is none other than Horse. Horse is a tattooed, long-haired gorgeous biker man. He oozes danger and sex and Marie needs to get involved with him as much as she needs a hole in the head.Horse is crude. He is domineering. He wants Marie. They form a sort of a friendship and when things get a little more serious Marie turns down our alpha biker not understanding exactly all that he is offering. Due to some extreme stupidity on Jeff\u2019s part, he runs into some trouble with The Reapers MC. Now, in an effort to save her brother, Marie has no choice but to accept Horse\u2019s offer and become his property. Marie is clueless as to what this all entails; however, she is thinking of her brother and saving his life.\n\"\u2026you don't call the shots,\" he whispered. \"We clear?\"\"Your rules,\" I whispered back. \"Or I leave. And what happens if I do?\"\"To you?\" he said. \"Nothing. You're with me of your own free will. But the club has to be paid in blood, Marie, not even I control that. Don't forget.\"\nSo ensues a battle of wills between Marie and Horse. Marie has fallen into this dangerous and dark biker world that she knows nothing about. They have different rules. They live their lives according to their own rules. They make their own reality and it is one where the men call the shots. Marie, despite coming to like the bikers and the old ladies, has a hard time with this new world and also has a hard time with Horse\u2019s caveman and possessive attitude. Can she succumb to this sexy biker who wants to make her his?\n\u201cSomeday,\u201d he whispered softly in my ear. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you. Not until you\u2019re ready for me\u2026 But someday I\u2019m going to own all of you, Marie. You\u2019re all mine, babe. Knew it the first time I saw you. Couldn\u2019t give you up if I tried.\u201d\n Horse is a wonderful hero. I loved the fact that meeting Marie knocked him off his ass, especially when she didn\u2019t automatically fall down at his feet and accept his offer to become his property. This dominant alpha didn\u2019t even know what to do with that. His poor feelings were hurt. I also loved Marie. She is sassy and loyal. Her loyalty towards her family is admiral even though her brother is a douche and did not deserve her love. She steps up to save her brother and, although Horse seems to be in control of her, she does allow him to walk all over her. Yes, both Marie and Horse make some dumb-ass decisions; however, they learn, they grow and they fight for their HEA.\n\u201cFuck, this is gonna piss you off and then you aren\u2019t gonna let me stick my dick in you,\u201d he muttered.\u201cDo you have to be so crude?\u201d I snapped.\u201cHave you met me?\u201d\u201cWho says I\u2019d let you do it anyway?\u201d\u201cBabe,\u201d he replied in a low, rough voice, raising his eyebrow at me.\u201d\n Reaper's Property is hot! The sex scenes were smokin\u2019! I loved seeing Marie grow and become stronger and also begin to own her sexuality. Horse is definitely an extremely sexual creature so this all added up to some panty-melting sexiness. I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of some of the scenes during the biker parties. However, they were eye opening to say the least and I just took them as being a part of biker life. Not for me, but I am not part of that life. This book is erotic. It is exciting. And, it has a hero named Horse. Really, you can not ask for more. I fell in love with our hero and heroine and the cast of supporting characters. It was definitely a great ride and I am so glad that I read Reaper\u2019s Property. I am looking forward to more excitement from Ms. Wylde and her Reapers! Bring it!\n\u201cI\u2019m a Reaper, and this is my world. You wear my patch, you be my woman and I\u2019ll be your man. We take the good times together and fight through the bad times. No games.

I'm only taking issue with the romanticizing of things which should never be romanticized (in a contemporary) without some sort of heavy disclaimer or taboo label. I would have been easier on this book if it had been marketed as taboo and written from the point of view of challenging the reader's perceptions. But this is even labeled as romantica. So FAIL it is.Some spoilers ahead and a slight bit of swearing. I'm not in the mood to have to censor myself or try to figure out how to write a polite review which doesn't reveal too much. All bets are off today. Read on at your own peril.If I see one more representation of a biker who is an oiled-up, hair-free model posing on a bike that no MC member would be caught dead on, I'm probably going to scream. We're talking about a Motorcycle Club, right?As well, the next time I see anyone bitching about Twilight for being stalker-rific, i'm going to ask if they've read any of the recent \"alpha biker\" books to have come out. At this point, I'm going to start referring to a vampire watching someone sleep as the more cuddly version of stalking. Because right about now, that behavior seems downright endearing compared to being blackmailed and/or kidnapped and forced to have to become someone's fuck-buddy. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? It's not okay, people. It's not cute. It's not romantic. It's not sexy. Any guy who thinks he's doing you a favor by trading your brothers life for your sexual favors is NOT WORTH DROOLING OVER.Wow, I didn't realize how much my switch had been flipped until I started writing this review. In so many ways, this book was a thousand times better than Undeniable. In all honesty, the writing was much more polished and the story had a clearer PoV that wasn't flailing all over the place like it was in Undeniable. Hell, I even think Horse was genuinely more likable than Deuce when looking at the big picture. Unfortunately, it was the initial setup for this story which screwed everything up. The book starts off with Marie (one of the dumbest characters I've read to date) frothing at the mouth over a guy for reasons unknown. At least with Undeniable, the chick was raised in the MC world and being treated like this was what she knew and expected, so I wasn't going to rip on someone for staying in a familiar cycle (i.e. crime begets crime). That situation was still ridiculous but it was more understandable.But Marie...ridiculous, clueless, brain-dead Marie...Yes, I get it - he's hot. Yes, I get it - he's hot.YES, I GET IT - he's hot. Right now, I'm ashamed to be a woman, if this is what we've evolved into - frothing at the mouth over a man who is disrespecting you with his words and is rape-y with his actions. Just because a person doesn't physically force someone to have sex with them does not mean that the situation isn't rape. Marie was FORCED into the situation (okay, so she went like a willing, whipped puppy dog...but only after being told that this was her fate, else her brother face the wrath of the Reapers). Plus, he punched her wall and broke her door after she said no. For a moment, I was almost happy that Marie was standing up for herself by telling him no. But then, the moment passed because she then laid down and took it like a pro. Sure, she was forced into a bad situation. But she sure seemed to be enjoying it. Was she ever really disgusted by this man who turned her into his own personal sex slave? Because if she was, I never bought into it. Even in her thoughts, she was never really all that disturbed. Yet, even with me saying that, I actually liked Horse to a certain extent. He is one of those people who you want to root for as a reader, even though he was a screwed-up person. Yes, he was completely off-base for what he did, but we got to see his side of things and were able to (somewhat) understand where his though process was at when we were in his head. Yes, he acted rape-y in a roundabout way and I didn't like that. But any time he thought he might actually hurt Marie, he did show remorse for it. But Marie wasn't seeing what we were seeing all of the time. She didn't know that he was conflicted. She only accepted what she was given with not enough feelings of 'ewwww' over what she was being put through. Even if she was forced to have to go along with it all, wouldn't the fact that she was being forced be enough to make her slow her roll at least a little?Therefore, I found Marie to be completely uh...what's the way to describe her? Oh yeah - this. How can a woman be constantly in heat over a man who hadn't proved himself worthy of her affection?Oh right, I know why. Because he was hot. Excuse for a moment me while I crawl into a corner and cry for humanity. There's a reason why I love the show Sons of Anarchy (hint : it has nothing to do with being a romance). I like watching shit hit the fan. And for that reason, I did find this book to be entertaining. And again - if Marie had at least started out more resistant, I could have possibly handled a story in which two people overcome a bad situation and find a way to make things work. I'm okay with \"big baddies\" being redeemed in many cases. Horse did have a soft side in there somewhere. But he never really had to pay for his actions.The Marie Dumbass Hall of FameEven scary, the man made my panties wet.~Pssst...Marie. He's scary for a reason. It involves unapologetic violence and killing.I swayed a little as he stopped, reaching out with one finger to trace my collarbone from my shoulder inward, then running it down between my breasts, grazing the sides. He raised it to his mouth, tasting my sweat. He smelled like motor oil and sex.Holy shit.\"Hey, sweet butt,\" he said.~ THIS IS THE VERY FIRST MEETING. What woman would be okay with being touched inappropriately by someone they didn't know? By the way, she was in full arousal mode. Within a few minutes, she was wondering how she could stop herself from pushing her breasts in his face. Classy broad, this one.I'm ashamed to admit that I creamed my pants right then and there instead of kicking him in the nuts like a sensible girl.~ First off, gross. I don't want to know about your discharge, woman. Secondly, she's aware that she's being stupid. Oh right...hot man trumps all.Part of me wondered if Horse had come back. You know which part - that little nub between my legs.\"You need to get better locks,\" Horse said casually. \"It took me about ten seconds to get in here.\"~He breaks in and you're horny again. Forget the saying having to do with guys thinking with the wrong head. Apparently, dumb women are capable of the same thing.\"I'm in charge here, don't forget it,\" he stated.I nodded, mesmerized.~lalalalalalalalala. I'm in my happy place, humming a tune right now. Anything to make the pain go away.I didn't think he had a girlfriend but we hadn't actually talked about it. Probably should have asked that before grabbing his dick in the pool.~Nah. Because that would have required thinking about something other than sex.My anger disappeared, replaced with terrible unease. I'd forgotten how terrifying this could be.~You get the point.I could go on and on. She finally stands up to him in one scene which had me cheering, then she went and started spamming him with \"can we talk?\" texts. Co-dependency is a bitch, apparently. And don't even get me started about how a near-rape experience with another person was glossed over in favor of more sexual tension. Sigh. But I'm not giving this book 1 star for the following reasons :1. When I wasn't screaming at Marie, I was entertained by the story. I like reading about MC life. Organized clubs and gangs have always fascinated me. 2. I actually liked a lot of the characters other than Marie. Picnic is one of the characters who I'm rooting for to find a HEA. I also want to see Picnic's daughter break out and find a life of her own. 3. The writing was decent. The author can tell a good story. Since my main frustration did not revolve around the club life aspect, I think that I might enjoy reading other books in this series with a different take on a female lead. They can't all be Marie, right? At least I'm hoping *cross fingers*4. The old ladies were an entertaining bunch. Sisterhood can be fun to read about.5. This quote : \"It's a .38,\" he said proudly. \"I know you're a .22 girl, but it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship.\"6. I felt like Horse was honestly willing to try and change his ways. We don't always get to see this in books. Sometimes the men go for a lukewarm compromise. In this case, the man did actually make the effort to try and be worthy of the woman he loved. It came later than I would have liked to have seen but at least it happened."}, {"userName": "Spoiler Whore-Momoa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3531683-spoiler-whore-momoa", "userReview": "What in the FUCK did I just read? Did I read about a man named Horse who's hung like a horse? Yes.An Alpha bad ass mofo biker? Yes. A heroine named Marie who doesn't know her way in the biker world but somehow becomes a badass herself. Yes.Did I get so caught up in the story and characters that when it ended I had to use my left hand to stop my right hand pointer from sliding the page on my kindle cause my brain didn't connect to said pointer that the book ended? Yes.Did I love it? You bet your sweet butt I did!This book is not only about Marie and Horse. It's also about family and their family dynamics. Marie and her problems with soon to be ex husband, her brother and her relationship with her mother who's in jail. Horse and his biker family The Reapers and their lifestyle. We get to meet some of them and their old ladies and sweet butts. They're funny, serious and love to have a great time. There's also a heartbreaking story with one couple that did bring tears to my eyes. Each character brings the story together either with their stupidity, personalities and betrayals and bantering.We do get Marie and Horse's POV's which I enjoyed. Their chemistry is instant and Marie is hesitant on their first encounter, leaving Horse with a case of blue balls. When they finally come together and when they get together its explosive. There's rough sex, sweet love making, angry sex, anal play which leaves to anal sex and voyeurism. There are some situations that some readers might find cring worthy but the author did a well job with said situations. The story flows perfectly that you do not want to leave the Reaper world.Loved the epilogue. Loved it!Favorite lines/moments:\"So why are you called Horse?\"\"Cause I'm hung like one,\" he replied, smirking.Only my mother would end up finding love by trying to run over two cops. Clearly, John Benson was an idiot.\"Fuck, this is gonna piss you off and then you aren't gonna let me stick my dick in you,\" he muttered.\"Do you have to be so crude?\" I snapped. \"Have you met me?\"Hid dick approved. It wanted to squeeze between those boobs and shoot out a pretty pearl necklace for her to wear. It's crude but I loved that line.\"Jerk.\" \"Hot piece of ass.\"\"Don't call me that!\"\"I was referring to myself,\" he replied\"She'd gone all Pulp Fiction on us, ready to defend you by killing all of us if she had to. Crouched over your body like Wonder Woman.

Who could resist? I sure couldn't...and to set you up, here's how I see the infamous Horse:Phewww...okay, back to the story (if I can focus!)...Horse sees girl. Horse wants girl.Horse takes girl. The end. Well, almost but no, really, that is it essentially with a few major drama scenes and whooo hooo steamy sex scenes. Hey, he wasn't nicknamed Horse for nothing!! And he's very proud of himself for living up to that. I really enjoy these type of books that have scenes that take you past your comfort zone and while this one wasn't as intense as Undeniable (by Madeline Sheehan), it still managed to hook me and I could not put it down. I love reading about two people that just seem right for each other but there's some reason it's hard for them to get together. Understandably, Marie is not from the motorcycle gang lifestyle and she is really oblivious! There are some really funny scenes where she just doesn't get it but it also endears her to you. I like that she put herself out there and tried to acclimate to their environment and for the most part, she learned and grew. However, there was a part at the end, where she didn't learn. Granted, it made for some good drama but it did seemed a bit out of character. Back to Horse...the one problem I had is that I never got why he wanted Marie so much and why he fell in love with her. I get that he thought she was hot (especially with a gun!), he liked her cooking and fighting with her but I was hoping that we would get more of the why especially with having his POV. (which was fantastic!) I also loved that Horse was more than just a sex machine but that he had a good mind and was the accountant for the club. (The dummy ledgers were perfect!!)And I loved all the drama. It's always great seeing the Alpha male get jealous as well as the heroine. I'm glad that JW reined things in though and she just pushed things a bit. There are a lot of other great characters. I really loved the relationship between Marie and Jeff (her brother). I wished things would have worked out differently. And thank goodness for the other \"old ladies\" taking care of Marie...she really needed them. There are a plethora of characters that JW could keep on writing about and I wouldn't mind at all. In fact, I would LOVE it. Here's to more Reapers!Favorite quotes: \u2665 Horse: What you wearing?

AGAIN?!? \nWell what can I say about this book. It's awesome! It's crude, it's rude, it's rough and it's totally panty melting hot. Second time around I read this with my girls and it was just as good. I get it's it's a hardcore biker story and not for everyone. Meet Horse:\nA hot ass, rough, biker who want a clueless Marie. Getting introduced to biker life is a shock to Marie's system. She resists, she objects, she insults with her rejection to be an old lady (stupid girl) but in the end she has no choice. Her brother is 50 thousand in debt with Horse's MC, to save his life Marie agrees to be Horse's um... house mouse w/benefit... or is she?\n\u201cThis is weird, you get that? You kidnapping me, holding me hostage and then sending me to school?\nAs she gets to know the true life of being a biker's old lady she realizes what a big mistake she made rejecting Horse, but thankfully there are always 2nd chances.\n\n\u201cI want you to be my old lady, babe. That\u2019s all I have to offer. I\u2019m a Reaper, and this is my world. You wear my patch, you be my woman and I\u2019ll be your man.

It wanted to squeeze between those boobs and shoot out a pretty pearl necklace for her to wear.\n\nI wanted to bite him and lick him and kick him in the nuts all at the same time.\n\n\u201cBut are you sure it\u2019s big enough? Those are really tiny little bullets, Horse. If I\u2019m gonna be a badass biker chick, shouldn\u2019t I have a bigger gun?\u201d \u201cA .22 was big enough to kill Bobby Kennedy,\u201d he replied, and I stopped smiling and raised my brows. \u201cDamn.\u201d \u201cNo shit.

I want to know what kind of punishment Max got for trying to rape Marie. That's a huge infraction right there, so what happened to him? He was only away a couple months - was short term banishment his punishment? Or did Horse beat the shit out of him, as I would have expected? I mean, really, that's a huge crime. HUGE! Honestly, I'm not sure why Max was still breathing, let alone welcomed back to the club. I need more information on that.2. I don't like the whole second, secret email address thing. The way the club was monitoring her, the way they were looking for their leak - they weren't too bright if they didn't catch that. And about that... did she ever come clean to Horse? I don't like the lies, the sneaking around. I mean, I do get why she did it, but once she found out that her brother wasn\u2019t being honest, when she discovered what he was up to\u2026 she had to see that she\u2019d been duped. So, was she upfront with Horse, who nearly died trying to rescue her? For me to believe they have a solid relationship, a relationship built on trust, those things needed to be worked out where I could see them. I didn't get a true soul mate feeling between Horse and Marie, and this is, in part, why.3. I would have liked the epilogue to include details about how Marie managed to get away with murder. Yeah, the MC got her an attorney, but she still had blood all over her, two dead, and one mostly dead, bodies... how was all that explained? Again, this is huge!

I just want to share with you why this book wasn't my cup of tea and why I feel like I need to sleep for 3 days so my eyes can, somehow, forget this thing.And I'm sorry if this is your favorite book or you just love it. I tried.Also, I want to let you know that I don't know what happens at the end of this book. I don't know if things get better but right now I just can't bring myself to care. I will only talk about what I read.If there's something I hate more than an abusive man is a dumb-ass woman. That's it. You know, there's a lot of women fighting for themselves, there are a lot of badass female characters, women of honor but Marie is not one of them.I tried to be on her side, really. I tried to see things from a psychological aspect, you know, maybe she was still in some kind of shock, maybe she felt guilty or like shit, maybe she was confused and took the first male attention she got, maybe she thought that she deserved what she got and I know she lef her husband but I just... I tried to think of Marie as a victim, because clearly she must have been nuts to jump from one abusive relationship to another. And before you tell me it was all consensual, I know that. I also know Horse cares about Marie but still. One would think: uhm, you know, I did nothing with my life and now I can. I can put all that ugliness behind me and start over. I can save money and go to culinary school. I can do stuff for myself. That's not how Marie's brain operates so I cannot say she's a victim or that she's confused so I can only say she's just plain stupid.Then we have Horse.I have no words for him.The only way I tolerated the guys this long was because I was picturing Jason Momoa while reading. Not kidding at all.I went from:to:Because I can't respect a man or a person who thinks like this:\"If she left him, he\u2019d hunt her down and drag her back home by the hair if he had to.\" but says  \u201cYou\u2019re with me of your own free will...\" HA! Hypocrite much?I love an alpha man. I love when they take control. I adore reading them but there's a big difference between being an alpha man and being an abusive bastard. He might not hit her but he plays with her and treats her like an object. Call me softy if you want but I can tolerate and enjoy all kind of thing in bed and I usually don't mind at all dirty words but Horse was just nasty in and outside the bedroom. And don't get me started with those sweet moments when he showed how much he cares about Marie because all I could think about was when a man who's hitting his woman gives her flowers or pats her damned head after the beating. Fucking sick.Seriously, I was just annoyed and I felt rather insulted. And frustrated because there were parts of the books that held my attention but it wasn't enough.And I don't feel confortable rating this book since I didn't finish it.Like I said I'm sorry because I really wanted to like this book like y'all but yeah, that didn't happen.I wish someone just..."}, {"userName": "Georgia \u2665 Team Dex \u2665", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9138738-georgia-team-dex", "userReview": "4 GALLOPING starsMeet Horse, the man from your worst nightmares that may be all your dreams come true...\u201cSo why are you called Horse?\u201d \u201cCause I\u2019m hung like one,\u201d he replied, smirking.Attitude, arrogance, danger, sex appeal are oozing from this great specimen of man.\nMarcus Antonius Caesar McDonnell\nBikerAll man, warrior*insert pic of a sexy man in his underwear of your choice*Exciting and arousing this book drew me right in and never let me go.

They offer Marie her brother\u2019s life and his chance to make good on the theft in exchange for her going to live with Horse. The book follows Marie and Horse in the events leading up to that point and then the story continues from there.Below is the link for \u201cSticky Sweet\u201d (Reaper\u2019s MC, #0.5)Their first meeting from Horse\u2019s POV. I recommend reading after chapter 1 of Reaper\u2019s Property.http://joannawylde.net/styled/styled-...Hero: Marcus Antonius Caesar McDonnell, \u201cHorse\u201d/30 years old/ex-marine - biker - Reaper\u2019s MC member - accountant/black hair/green eyes/6\u20196\u201dHeroine:  \u201cMarie Caroline Jensen/25 years old/childcare worker/separated/dark brown hair/5\u20194\u201dStory is mostly told from Marie\u2019s POV, but every once in awhile we get Horse\u2019s POV (in 3rd person).At first glance Horse has so many of the superficial qualities I like in a hero\u2026 sinfully good looks:\n\n\u201cTall, built, with shoulder-length hair he kept pulled back in a ponytail, and thick black stubble on his face. Stark, tribal cuffs ringed his wrists and upper arms. And what a face\u2026 Horse was handsome, like movie star handsome.\u201d\n\nAnd he is very well endowed:\n\n\u201cSo why are you called Horse?\u201d \u201c\u2019Cause I\u2019m hung like one,\u201d he replied, smirking.\u201d\n\nBut we soon learn that there are many more layers to Horse. He is this hard, strong and fierce biker, but he is also this soft, sweet and kind man. He is smart, working as an accountant handling the clubs complex finances. And he is funny:\n\n\u201cGlad you like it.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, confused. \u201cMy body,\u201d he replied, smirking. \u201cIt\u2019s the only one you get to look at or f~ck, so it\u2019s good the package works for you.\u201d I blushed fiercely\u2026\u201d\n\nMarie was both naive and annoying which is often the case when paired with a larger-than-life hero. But she is also sweet, kind and loyal and she is reflective, insightful and she is trying to make a new life for herself:\n\n\u201c\u2026 while it might not have been a picture-perfect childhood, it hadn\u2019t been too bad for a couple of white-trash kids whose dad took off before they hit grade school.\u201d\n\nAnd just like Horse she has her funny moments:\n\n\u201cI blinked at him, dazed. \u201cGonna f~ck you now.\u201d \u201cSure,\u201d I whispered, dazed. \u201cNot sure I\u2019m gonna be able to participate too much, think you blew a circuit or something.\u201d***Horse: What do you think? Gotta go, church in a few Me: Church?!?? Didn\u2019t peg you for a church kind of guy Horse: What we call a club meeting. I try to stay away from collection plates Me: Don\u2019t get holy water in your beer!\n\nFor me this story offers it all, starting with a glimpse into the Reaper\u2019s MC club life:\n\n\u201cRemember, we\u2019re a tribe. We live together, we die together and what\u2019s ours is ours. When times are good, we\u2019re all good. Bad times, we may eat shit but we eat it together. Most people can\u2019t handle that level of commitment.\u201d***\u201cWe\u2019re men\u2014one percenters. F~cking kings of the MC world. We don\u2019t follow the rules, we make our own goddamn rules.\u201d\n\nMany of Reaper\u2019s members were veterans and this story is also a stark reminder of our many heroes who never came home:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s Freebird chapter now and he doesn\u2019t need his patches anymore. It\u2019s time to send them back to him. We won\u2019t forget. Reapers forever, forever Reapers.\u201d\n\nAnd this is of course very much an erotic tale about Horse and Marie and everything that is mind-blowing sex with Horse:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in charge here, don\u2019t forget it,\u201d he stated. I nodded, mesmerized.\u201d***\u201cI have no idea how long it was before Horse came, because I was floating in my own little world. He collapsed on top of me, managing to keep enough of his weight to one side that he didn\u2019t crush me. Our breathing slowed. Then he leaned up on one elbow, sliding me so we lay face-to-face.\u201d\n\nHorse may have brought Marie on the pretense of collateral, but there is a budding love story giving as a glimpse into the other, softer side of Horse:\n\n\u201cBut someday I\u2019m going to own all of you, Marie. You\u2019re all mine, babe. Knew it the first time I saw you. Couldn\u2019t give you up if I tried.\u201d\n\nIn addition there is suspense, the intrigue and mystery will keep you at the edge of your seat until the very last page. I will say no more. You need to read this story yourself!All in all an excellent read, great character development of both Horse and Marie. In their story you will also meet many interesting side characters, some who most likely will be featured in the next-coming books. ***Hero rating: 5 stars Heroine rating: 3.5 starsSex scenes rating: 5 starsSex scenes frequency: 5 starsStoryline concept rating: 5 starsStorytelling skills rating: 5 starsStory ending rating: 5 starsBook editing rating (5 = no edits spotted): 4.5 stars************************************************Overall rating: 5 starsWould I recommend this book: Yes.Would I re-read this book: Maybe later.Would I read future books by this author: Yes."}, {"userName": "Danielle", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22412202-danielle", "userReview": "I don\u2019t know how many times this book has crossed my feed, but every time I dismissed it, for the very fact that the hero\u2019s name is Horse. That was just too eye rolly and cringy for me to jump into. But thanks to an awful book slump, I somehow ended up reading this one until way too late into the night. It was actually really good. IF you like the motorcycle club atmosphere: crude language, and the open discussion and viewing of erotic activities. I found it was too much for me sometimes, and I\u2019m no prude.The hero was my kind of hero. But I\u2019ve realized long ago my preference for men is really messed up, and you can decide if he\u2019s for you with this one little gem: (pardon my language\u2014he says it, not me)\n\u201cThis pussy is mine. You are mine. I\u2019ll fuck you when and where I want, and you can either take it or get the fuck out. Are we clear?\u201d\nSo, yeah. That\u2019s Horse for ya. In my mind: MAN PERFECTION.No, but he was really was. Yeah, he says some stupid shit that will get your inner feminist riled, but he was caring and gentle in the perfect ways. I\u2019ll be honest: I hate the MC club lifestyle. I rarely read books in this subgenre because of it. The slut-shaming, casual use of women like toys, and the entire outlook that women are possessions, irks me like no other. The latter is less of a problem for me, because hey, we all like a possessive man even if we won\u2019t admit it. But even though this life is consensual for even the women or \u201cclub whores,\u201d the atmosphere is exhausting and unfulfilling to me. No woman out there is all right with being a sexual object for an entire motorcycle club and you will never convince me otherwise. So in these stories, I\u2019m always put off by the relationships portrayed. Reaper's Property represented all those stomach-nauseating relationships that I don\u2019t enjoy to read about in my free time. But. The relationship between the H and h was engrossing, fascinating, and written pretty damn well. This was an interesting storyline that wasn\u2019t predictable. The heroine was refreshing, and I honestly had no idea what she would do. Not because of poor character development, but because she had a layered, impulsive personality. She could be a little weak sometimes, but somehow it just worked for me. Apparently I\u2019m in a masochistic mood lately. Because I loved when the hero would boss her around and she\u2019d listen. A little messed up, but eh, shit happens. Twenty-five year old Marie left her husband when he hit her and moved into her brother\u2019s trailer. It doesn\u2019t take long until she realizes he\u2019s mixed up with some bad people when a motorcycle club starts coming around. She forms a friendship with them, and a flirtation with one who went by the name of Horse. It seemed like a normal relationship at first; very normal with movie watching and everything. When Horse offers her a cut to be his \u201cold lady\u201d she refuses, and naturally he doesn\u2019t take well to that. So when the club finds out her brother is stealing for them, it\u2019s either kill him, or\u2014this is Horse\u2019s idea\u2014to take Marie as a sex slave. She agrees. But this doesn\u2019t turn out like a normal sex slave/captor relationship. They knew each other before and Horse makes it known pretty soon on that he wants more from her than sex. The sex. EROTIC AS HELL. Of which something a grandmother would faint from. But believe it or not, this is something that I think authors really struggle with. It\u2019s either mechanical, uninspiring, or cringe-worthy. But it was done with the perfect amount of description and emotion here to really connect you with these characters. A+ for the sex. And I think I feel the burning flames from Hell for reading it. I was totally convinced of their relationship. In love with the characters\u2014less in love with the atmosphere of MC club life, but you can\u2019t have everything. The plot was engrossing, but I did find it slowed down toward the end. Reaper\u2019s Property is a highly erotic romance set in the crude world of a motorcycle club. Engrossing, sometimes cringe-worthy obscenity, but not short of entertainment."}, {"userName": "Vishous", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7500821-vishous", "userReview": "First of all I would like to apologize to anyone who stumbled upon my status updates during reading this book!Yes I know they were very spoliery (is that even a word?) but I just could not help myself!

I don't know was that intended to be funny, some parts, but I seriously laughed my ass out! I was literally glued to it and had trouble with putting it down so I could at least grab a bite of food.

So when he gets into some serious trouble with a local MC, The Reapers, she doesn\u2019t hesitate to help him. Anything. \n\u201cThis is your option,\u201d Horse said to me abruptly. \u201cYou want to keep dumbass alive, pack a bag and climb on my bike when we leave.

Ever since he first laid eyes on her, he was determined to make her his. Horse and Marie had their chances to be together, but Horse\u2019s personality was confusing the hell out of Marie. Not to mention his involvement in an MC and what all that entails; including access to the MC\u2019s harem of easy women. She did not want to be just another notch on his bedpost. When Jeff fucks up, this was his opening he needed to have Marie right where he wants her. \n\u201cI\u2019m not gonna let you go, Marie. I\u2019m keeping you and I don\u2019t care if I go to hell for doing it. I don\u2019t care about anything but fucking you.\u201d \nJust like sexy Rock Star books, I\u2019ve also learned that I\u2019m a sucker for Badass Biker books. To me, they are the epitome of what I love most about my Alpha Heroes: They\u2019re strong, brooding, sexy, possessive, protective and have that don\u2019t fucking mess with me or my woman attitude. Fucking swoon! If you\u2019re a fan of Madeline Sheehan\u2019s Undeniable, you will probably like this read.

This one isn\u2019t for the weak, so if you are of the butthurt generation don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you. The premise behind Reaper\u2019s Property is that Marie\u2019s brother is a douchebag stoner idiot/\u2018puter genius who was hired to do some creative maneuvering of the motorcycle club\u2019s funds and decided to skim off the top.

There's one thing you have to know - if you call someone \"horse\" (konj) on my native language, you better be ready for fight because it's like telling someone he's a dumb fuck or something similar.

So I picked up my good, old buddy, you know, that gray thingy called Kindle. First impression after five pages: \"Oh, the white trash - excuse for being a big failure.\" I had some Sookie flashbacks. But then... the bikes. The boys. Pour Some Sugar On Me too, please! \"But something about the way this biker swaggered, taking up space and the very air around him with his presence, caught me off guard and knocked me right in the\u2026 Well, you know.\"I think I know! Bossy bastard - but you can't help yourself. Oh, I know, honey...  What surprised me the most is that this book is actually really well written. So far I didn't have big, shiny moments reading Ellora's Cave novels. Okay, it still is typical when it comes to all steamy scenes, descriptions of his.... horseness and all the nipples poking through shirts. But I enjoyed every minute of it. Joanna Wylde knows her words. Storyline is interesting and it will keep you on the edge until the very end. One thing that really made me want to kick something was all that stuff about sweet butts. Seriously? I understand that it would be the ultimate male fantasy (right after fucking virgin who acts like she is not one), but girl who gets off on something like that - what the hell is wrong with you? Again, I have to admit that I could even understand that (just slightly) - the decadence, freedom to act as you wish - but I do not like being humiliated for doing what I want. Reaper's Property is just first book in Reapers MC series - I can't wait to read other guy's stories.Until next time, sleep tight and let the kinky guys bite!xoxoGlass"}, {"userName": "Rach", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11713460-rach", "userReview": "[image error]"}, {"userName": "Sarah Toussaint", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30724165-sarah-toussaint", "userReview": "I had two problems with this book; the heroine did a lot of slut-shaming, she spoke ill about women who had a lot of sex and showed bare skin, which I thought was despicable of her to do. One scene in particular that infuriated me was when she was watching a girl get gang-banged, and the girl was obviously enjoying getting fucked, but the heroine made some remarks about the scene that just turned my stomach. The girl wasn't being raped, she was having fun. So, can't women fuck as many men as they want without this heroine judging them for it?And it wasn't JUST the heroine doing the slut-shaming. Many women were looked down upon by a lot of other characters; \"old ladies\" and \"men.\"And the other issue I had, was the time-jump. To avoid spoilers, I won't tell you what time jump I'm talking about, but read and you'll find out. Overall, I liked the two characters, the heroine annoyed me a bit, but not too much. The chemistry was lacking but it was fine at the end."}, {"userName": "Kellie Maddox-Ward", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7309666-kellie-maddox-ward", "userReview": "Reasons you should read this book. 1.
