It continues the tale of Aylaen and Skylan. The story in itself is as interesting as in the previous books and it is a joy to read. But there are a few problems with the plot or the subplots, to be precise. I really did not like how the romantic aspect evolved in this book. It somehow nullified everyhting that has happened thus far. Also there were some annoying and unrealistic things that happened...All in all, this is still a fun book to read but somehow not as good as the two previous books.

My perception of this book is probably flawed by their very first mistake. Their cover did not state what book this was in the series which I really hate because I'm a chronological order freak. Worse if there was a continuation from previous books. I was thrown right in the middle of the battlefield with names like Aelyeon and Aelon... It was difficult at first but quickly remembered who was which. I did not see how much the characters have grown from previous books so I really did not connect with them and did not really care if they died. In this specific book, I don't see much of any character development but a real messed up family relationship. This is not a spoiler (probably will spoil if you're reading previous books.. I don't know) as it's the first few chapters. Skylan loves Aelyeon, Raegar is Skylan's cousin who betrayed them. Treia is Aelyeon's sister who also betrayed them. Treia love Raegar. Both are couples. What??? Also, I find their actions a little illogical like when Treia killed their ally, she still freely walks about the ship. The authors did mentioned that they wanted to throw her overboard but didn't because she's Aelyeon's sister but at least tie and gag the woman, I'm sure Aelyeon would be at least OK with that! Aren't they afraid of their own safety? It's like OK.. She killed our ally, no need to take precautions. She walks around trying to spew ill words about everything to Aelyeon. I found it annoying and nobody seems to want to gag her running mouth which unsurprisingly ruined their plans later on. Not even the dragon was interesting. He's just a block of wood with glowing eyes really. The only person I found interesting was Wulfe, a fae child with an mysterious back story that you just want to know more about but there wasn't much of him in the story. Very disappointed. Won't be reading this series."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4649461-jim", "userReview": "When I picked this up I thought it was the final part of the trilogy, so imagine my surprise when I realized it was instead the third part of a quartet. It does explain why a large part of the first half of the book feels like filler, though. While the main character, Skylan, has grown a whole lot since the first book and has grown into a very enjoyable character, the novel spins its wheels for the first half, especially when it switches POV completely in Book Two. Once it switches back, however, the story picks up, as the intrigue between the various sects of gods is interesting, as is the subplot of what exactly the dragons know and what they intend to do. The climax is very thrilling; the book barrels on through its last hundred pages at a rousing pace, but the ending is a little abrupt. In short, it would have been better with a better first half, but is still a good book."}, {"userName": "Ubiquitousbastard", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10821965-ubiquitousbastard", "userReview": "[And is then somewhat reversed?
