These are three short stories featuring Letty Dobesh, a thief and addict, with a mesmerising personality. There is a TV series based on Letty with Michelle Dockery in the title role. Crouch provides a commentary of how he got the idea for Letty, how the stories and the odd character were changed and rearranged for the TV series. The Letty stories come with twists and a sting in the tale, this behoves me to not spill the beans on the storylines and spoil it for others.In The Pain of Others, Letty has been stealing from occupants of hotel rooms when two men, Arnold and Chase return early. Letty hides in a closet and hears plans to murder Daphne, the wife of Chase. Letty is unable to let this go, only to find her actions have unexpected consequences. Sunset Key has Letty being paid to spend the last night of freedom for a Kenneth Lay type of character on his island. The following morning, he will go to prison. Letty finds there is more planned for this evening than she has bargained for. The longest story is Grab, and it showcases Letty's talent as a grifter in a Las Vegas casino heist where nothing is as it appears.Blake Crouch is certainly a gifted storyteller who spins yarns I want to read. Even with these short stories he succeeds admirably well in keeping the reader hooked with the character of Letty Dubosh. It does not take long to read this book of short stories and I can recommend them. Many thanks to Thomas and Mercer for an ARC."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9684061-melissa", "userReview": "Good Behavior aka the Letty Dobesh Chronicles is an action-packed, pulse-pounding and exciting collection of stories told through the eyes of a junkie thief. Typically, I\u2019m not the biggest fan of short stories, but there was a part of me that couldn\u2019t resist this compilation from the mastermind behind Dark Matter, a story that left me completely mesmerized last year. Not to mention, these stories are the foundation for a new show, so what better way to find out if it\u2019s worth a watch.\n\nThe Pain of Others\n\n - Letty Dobesh, our lead character and meth head, one that just spent the last nine months in prison, is back at it. She\u2019s in the midst of a job at a hotel, using a pilfered master key to lift things from guest rooms, when she overhears a murder-for-hire scenario. Should she intervene? Her choice is interesting, considering the easy alternative right at her fingertips. It all comes together in a way that lends a human side to her character in the eyes of the reader, but be warned, it just might leave you questioning the alternative, at least it did for me and Letty. I mean . . . WOW! What an ending.\n\nSunset Key\n\n - This story features the most down-and-out version of Letty. Jonesing for a score, with absolutely nothing to her name, not even a way to make it through the next day, she gets an opportunity . . . maybe of a lifetime. With the assurance of a huge payoff from a business associate, she heads to Sunset Key to pull off a heist. Once again, things aren\u2019t what they appear to be. The lesson to take away here - never underestimate ANYONE! With a bit of a horror feel, this was the most suspenseful and heart-pounding of the three, which I loved. The reality of the situation hadn\u2019t even crossed the realm of possibilities in my mind . . . what a twist!\n\nGrab\n\n - Going in, I honestly thought this was going to be my least favorite. Something about a Vegas heist sounded like a \u2018been there, done that\u2019 too many times already scenario. I have absolutely no shame in admitting I misjudged this story from its synopsis. This was definitely the most high energy of the three and featured who I thought was the most \u2018determined to change\u2019 version of Letty. All of the mishaps along the way, and fear they weren't going to pull it off, had me biting my nails in anticipation. Again, Blake Crouch hit me in the gut with an unexpected ending. What was that lesson again? Oh yeah, nobody and nothing is what it appears to be at first glimpse.After each short story, the author discusses his inspiration behind the idea and how it will play a part in the show, or not. Sadly, Sunset Key won\u2019t be happening because it doesn\u2019t line up with the overall feel of the show. Bummer. It was interesting to read Blake Crouch\u2019s thoughts on collaboration, how working with others has morphed his idea from a short story into something he never could have created on his own. I\u2019m definitely excited to see how it all comes together on screen. *Thank you to Thomas & Mercer and NetGalley for a copy in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Shelby *trains flying monkeys*", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1053760-shelby-trains-flying-monkeys", "userReview": "Letty Dobesh is fresh out of prison and has that nasty little meth addiction.\nA girl does what she has to do and ends up falling into her old ways once a 'job' is offered. The book is three novellas put together for the upcoming TV show so the first one is Letty on the job and overhears a husband and a hit man planning to kill the wife. Letty does have some principles and she gets more involved than she should have. (I actually liked this story the best of the three...so that means everyone else will hate it.)Letty then gets offered a heist type job, that entails her being the female companion of a rich guy who's last night before prison happens.\n(I loved this gif..so shoot me)Then the last story has Letty once again down on her luck and contemplating using again. \nShe ends up in Vegas on another job. (The job's give her the same thrill that using drugs do). This kinda goes the whole Hollywood version of a heist and I can see how it would work better on the screen verses the reading of it.\nSo for the overall book? I think Blake Crouch has spoiled me. I expect great things from him after reading \"The Wayward Pines\" series and the unbelievably awesome Dark Matter. So I expected to be blown away with this one. It just never really felt put together well enough for me. I know that each story wrapped itself up well and for novellas these are really pretty good. BUT as a whole book, nope. The stories didn't blend together well enough and I felt like I could figure out what was going to happen in every one of them. Blake Crouch usually has the magic to blow my granny panties off and they still on my butt right now.Letty's character could be so interesting. So I'm not giving up on her. I totally picture her in my head differently than the woman that is going to play her in the series though.

When I decided to read \nGood Behavior\n, a collection of three interlinked novellas, I wondered if lightning would strike twice for me when reading Crouch's books.My verdict? Crouch really is one hell of a writer. While this book didn't quite take my breath away like \nDark Matter\n did, he proved once again that he knows how to create some fantastic action scenes and ratchet up tension until you are absolutely dying to know what's going to happen next. And in Letty Dobesh, he has created a fantastically memorable character I hope we'll see again soon. (The adaptation of some of these stories, starring \nDownton Abbey\n's Michelle Dockery, is currently airing, and Crouch provides some insight into the creation of the television show in this book.)Letty Dobesh is fresh out of prison. She has a son she's not fit to see, a drug habit that she can't quite seem to shake, and while she needs to get herself back on the straight and narrow, she realizes more and more that she's happiest when she's in the middle of a scheme\u2014or using drugs. The sad thing is, despite a few missteps, she's generally really good at being a criminal.In \"The Pain of Others,\" Letty has returned to her old pastime of robbing hotel rooms when she overhears a conversation between two men, one who has just hired the other to kill his wife. Letty is unsure what to do. Should she contact the police, despite the compromising position she was in when she heard the murder being agreed upon? Should she just walk out of the room when she can and pretend she heard nothing? Or should she try and warn the wife of what is imminent?In \"Sunset Key,\" Letty is offered a multi-million dollar scheme from an old friend and fellow criminal. A very wealthy banker has been found guilty of defrauding millions of people, and he has been sentenced to a long prison term. He'd like to spend his last night of freedom with a special woman, and Letty can be that woman\u2014for a price. And in \"Bad,\" Letty gets the chance to be part of a heist unlike any others, but it is far from what she expected.Each of these novellas has a lot of twists and turns, and while you think you know how Crouch will wrap things up, you're not always right. The first and the third novellas in particular (\"The Pain of Others\" and \"Bad\") really threw me for a loop a few times. I don't know what it will be like watching the television adaptations knowing all I know, but I'm definitely going to have to see Letty in motion.Don't go into this expecting \nDark Matter\n or even the Wayward Pines series (which I've definitely added to my list). These are more straightforward crime stories than anything else, but they're still fascinating and utterly compelling.

She is also damaged: being a multiple offender and frequent inmate. She has a serious substance abuse problem and is no longer the legal mother of her son, having lost her parental rights. Crouch\u2019s creation of her is remarkable. He is able to convey in her all the conflicting emotions of a creative, obsessive mind struggling with addiction and emotional issues of monster truck proportions.Truth be said, I very much enjoyed his 2012 Pines and his 2016 Dark Matter, but it was this visit with Letty that pushed me over the edge and demanded with a junkie\u2019s insistence that I declare myself a Crouch fan.

You may be familiar with this character from TNT's television series: Good Behavior. Each short-story can be read in any order as they all are separate open and closed stories. Each novella is listed below along with an individual rating/review. I highly recommend this collection for fans of character-driven thrillers. Check it out!The Pain of Others- 5 starsThe Pain of Others is the Letty Dobesh story that most closely follows the television show, specifically the season 1, episode 1. However, the endings are vastly different which makes the book worth the read. When I say vastly different? Yeah...it has been a long while since a twist like that made my jaw drop to the floor. This was a lovely introduction to Letty's character. A woman full of consistent bad choices finally finds the motivation to do the right thing. But... sometimes maybe we shouldn't intervene. OMG!Sunset Key- 5 starsSunset Key\u00a0is a story that you haven't seen on the television show. This one was psychotic and I absolutely loved it! The main twist is revealed about half way through and it was jaw-dropping for me. Everything is running smoothly as planned and then bam! Oh, what a fun ride though! I was on the edge of my seat watching this play out. I don't know how they would ever be able to integrate this novella into the television series considering the direction they are driving the characters but I would love to see it. I'm a huge fan of all things resembling La Femme Nikita and this is a story that would fit in perfectly to a series like that. 5 stars!Grab- 4 starsPieces of Grab can be seen in Good Behavior: Season 1, Episodes 1 and 5, but this exact Letty Dobesh story has yet to make it to TV/film. It's a shame too because Grab is one hell of a ride! The thriller/suspense element is off the charts! This one would have been an easy 5-star rating for me but the twist at the end was way too far-fetched for my personal taste and my imagination is pretty broad. But the bulk of this story was perfection in terms of Letty's character development and the planning, execution, and spontaneous problem solving of an epic casino heist. Whether you are familiar with Letty's character or not, any of the Letty Dobesh novellas are well-worth the read. Note: I read the Kindle in Motion edition of Good Behavior. It features photos, gifs, and written commentary specifically designed to enhance the novellas and Letty's character as they relate to their adaptation to television. This was my first Kindle in Motion experience and I enjoyed it overall. Thank you Goodreads!!

Good Behavior introduces readers to Letty Dubesh. She's not your typical heroine. Actually, she's not a heroine at all but she is interesting.Crouch invites us into the life of one of the most troubled and flawed characters I've read in a while. There's no secret that she's fresh out of jail after serving time for felony theft. From page one it's obvious we would not be rooting for Suzie Homemaker but rather her complete opposite. In 3 novellas Crouch forces readers to care about her story. Regardless of her criminal past (and future), or struggle to stay sober for the child she's abandoned and left behind, Letty's story is impossible to look away from. Because Good Behavior is comprised of 3 novellas, it almost feels like no matter where I begin my review, I could potentially be spoiling her tale for others. I will say that I was very intrigued with her constant struggle between good and bad, right and wrong, life or death. My one gripe with this novel is that between the stories were brief interludes with Crouch and his reasoning behind everything. After the first interlude I felt like I was trapped in one long promo for the newest show in the TNT lineup. Although this didn't stop me from reading on, it was a little on the annoying side. Suffice it to say, Blake Crouch has got my attention. He paints a dynamic portrait in so few words that it's impossible not to see him through. And, reading on is always worth it. Cheer's to another good read. I look forward to seeing what's next for Letty.

The collection includes the books The Pain of Others, Sunset Key, and Grab. These stories and Letty are going to be the focus of a new show coming to television on the network TNT. Each novella features Letty on a different adventure and in the first Letty is freshly released from prison and fighting her addictions when she attempts to return to her former life of crime. Unfortunately when Letty learns of a murder she finds that there are lines that even she won't cross. Good Behavior is an OK enough read but perhaps I went into this expecting perfection and it seemed to fall a bit short of that for me. I've heard so many good things about Blake Crouch's books that I couldn't help but want to try one out but Letty and her stories just really didn't grab me the way I hoped. For a character that suffers from addiction I kind of found the fast paced adventures she ends up on a bit far-fetched. Really though I can see this one making an entertaining television show but reading all three novellas together it just seemed a bit jumpy going from one to the next with not enough to get me invested in Letty or believing her to be the heroine. Overall, three fast paced adventures featuring Letty, not as great as I was hoping for but still an OK read in the end.I received an advance copy from the publisher via NetGalley.

So I was quite excited to be reading Blake Crouch\u2019s three novellas that comprise his work centering on the character, Letty Dobesh. Also, this is the tie-in to the TV show and has photos of the cast at work and also the author\u2019s notes about each of the stories and how they were incorporated into the TV show.Letty Dobesh is out of prison and is back to being a thief and con-woman. She\u2019s an alcoholic and a drug addict. The only way she seems to be able to keep from the alcohol and drugs is to have the excitement of a heist going on. There are three novellas about Letty. The first is \u201cThe Pain of Others\u201d which is my favorite of the three and which is apparently going to be included in the first season of the TV show. That one is about Letty\u2019s intervention with a hitman in doing his job. The second, \u201cSunset Key\u201d, involves Letty\u2019s attempt to rob a man who is being sent to prison the next day for fraud. The longest of the three novellas is \u201cGrab\u201d, which is about a casino heist.From the advertisements I\u2019ve seen of the upcoming TV show and from my reading of other books by this author, I expected to have sympathy for Lettie. That wasn\u2019t the case at all. I had a hard time connecting with her or sympathizing with her life. She has a 6-year-old son who she has lost custody of and throughout the books, she longs to set things right with him and become the mother he needs. However, it just seems that her love of the excitement of thievery overcomes her maternal instincts so I had a hard time liking her. When things don\u2019t go well for her, she feels she has two choices \u2013 do a heist or do drugs. I just hope that Michelle Dockery can instill some sympathy into this character on the TV screen because these stories didn\u2019t for me, though other readers have said that they did have sympathy for her. As always, the author has written very entertaining stories, which are exciting and suspenseful, with quite a few surprise twists.

When she sets out to derail the job, she puts herself in the crosshairs of a killer, entangling them in a dangerous and seductive relationship, and so much more. This sexy hitman man Javier may be her path and key to redemption. That is if she does not screw it up. Javier is sensitive and caring.  He has pain in his life and his past. Leading him to his path as a hitman. They have a love/hate relationship. He lives on the outskirts of society due to an event from his childhood (we discover in the TV series).A constant pull between them as well as their own individual lives.

Forgive me here,  since I have watched the TV series (Season one Episodes 1-9, read the book, and listened to the audio (twice). You could say, I LOVE GOOD BEHAVIOR,  so using this review as a combo review of all three. I first listened to the audiobook narrated by  Julia Whelan and the author, Blake Crouch.  (Exceptional). Afterward,  immersed in Amazon Prime (TNT) TV Good Behavior.  Purchased the entire season. Taking the fantastic information provided by Blake in the audiobook and applied to how the 3 novellas were transformed to on-screen. This is a \u201cMust\u201d to read the book and learn all the backstory. The backstage, inside scoop of how the author created these characters, and his collaboration with Chad Hodge for the television show. Quite intriguing.

Was so excited, with \u201cChristmas coming early\u201d, began diving into the book, and once again, read it in one sitting. I bookmarked so many pages. Letty Dobesh  is troubled, flawed, beautiful, striking, smart, inventive, charismatic, self-destructive, a chameleon. She crosses between good and bad. A constant struggle. She is authentic. Real. Even though in (Episode 9) not happy with her attitude and kicking Javier to the curb with her betrayal. (Let\u2019s hope she can turn her mistakes around once again). I was dying with this one. Javier is good for her. Don't score. Don't kill. We follow Letty  on a journey as she attempts to discover who she really is, and wants more than anything to make peace with that woman, even if she does not fit \u201cinside the box\u201d society has drawn for her. She wants to be a good mother, a daughter, and a friend; to make up for her past mistakes and misdeeds. Every time she tries, she gets knocked down. Crouch is pitch perfect with his character development of both Letty and Javier. I like the transition from the book to the screen. The book: \u2022\tThe Pain of Others\u2022\tSunset Key\u2022\tGrabAfter each of these novellas  the author adds some insightful commentary about the work, the show, images, and other additional content from the journey, he has taken with Letty. No, I would not dare skip over these parts. I love it!  With the book, it is  like a backstage pass, with a peak at the inside operations. The reader becomes invested in the characters, the story, and a fan for life. Letty is flawed, irresistible, broken, lovely and brave. She wants desperately to get her son back. She keeps running into obstacles and pulled in by her addictions to stealing and the high. She is so good at being bad!  I wanted to hold off  writing my review until the last TV episode Season One; however, being it was on my  Top Books for 2016 List  my fellow GRs friends wanted to know my thoughts. Yes, I loved it! Letty Raines is a thief and con artist (impulsive), whose life is always one wrong turn, one bad decision, from implosion. Michelle Dockery is amazing. Juan Diego Botto (Javier) is sexy and to die for; each episode, I love him even more.  Currently I am in HIS corner.  Christian, Jacob, Estelle ( a piece of work), Rob and the other supporting characters only add to the intense drama. What a riot! In the meantime, I am now just finishing the 9th episode, and let me say, starting at episode 5, I fell totally in LOVE. A turning point, from five on. Letty and Javier  are intimately connected on so many levels, and ultimately become each other\u2019s saviors. Both emotionally-- two souls which are perfect for one another. At the opening of the 5th episode, when Letty opens with, \u201cyou came.\u201d Javier replies, \u201cyou called.\u201d OMG, that look between the two of them, was the best since: Jerry McGuire\u2019s  \"You had me at 'hello,\" and Nicholas Sparks\u2019 The Notebook,  \"I wrote you 365 letters. I wrote you every day for a year. It wasn't over\u2026 it still isn't over.\" A modern SEXY twist of The Notebook and Bonnie and Clyde. Letty can rock a wig. I think she needs to have her own line.

Letty is a convicted but highly dexterous thief, a recovering addict (kind of), and a down on her luck Mum who has lost her parental rights. She is the leading role in Blake Crouch's new TV show (coming to TNT on Nov 15). I think these stories could work well on screen, in particular, 'Grab', which is about a casino heist, but it won't actually be used until season 2 apparently. Due to the action scenes, I think it lends itself to watching rather than reading. I enjoyed these stories and can see how they could be made into a series as they all follow a certain pattern. The book contains supplemental information on the process of making the short stories into a screenplay and the reasoning behind changes being made etc. I actually found that quite interesting and I am looking forward to watching Good Behavior now just to see how the characters and the plot will be transferred to the screen. Obviously, this isn't anything like reading Crouch's novels Dark Matter or Pines but treated simply as an introduction to a character and to the forthcoming TV show it worked. Each story had a nice little twist and Letty was quite an intriguing character. Good, light entertainment.

Each story followed the exact same pattern: Down-on-her-luck recovering alcoholic/meth addict Letty meets a guy (a handler?) who has heard about her \"abilities\" as a thief, hires her for a heist, heist goes south, Letty escapes, and the story ends with a \"surprise\" betrayal. While this would get very tedious very quickly in book form, I can see how it would work as a TV show. Kind of reminds me of the old Quantum Leap series in which Sam Beckett leaps from time to time, always into some confusing/dangerous situation that he has to solve before the next leap.This is not a bad read by any means, and would make a good vacation read. The biggest problem I had was the lack of continuity between the stories, which simply didn't exist. At the end of each of the stories, Letty comes away with a huge payout after a heist, and with the start of the next story, she's destitute, barely surviving, unable to even buy herself a meal. Very confusing, and it made me wonder what happened with the money she had, and how long did it take her to squander it.I am looking forward to the TV show, though. The explanations and dialogue that the author provides after each story makes the TV show sound more interesting than the book was."}, {"userName": "11811 (Eleven)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4460829-11811-eleven", "userReview": "The more I read of Blake Crouch, the more I'm starting to realize that I may not be a fan.

As much as I'm making a comparison to a show that already exists, I still feel these stories are refreshing. All 3 stories were engaging and at the end, I was left wanting more of Letty.

Instead, Letty is a woman who has a good heart and some good intentions, but those intentions get overshadowed by the fact that she's also one hell of a thief. One of the best, actually, and she thrives on the power and the things that go along with being the best of the best. Unfortunately for Letty, she's also a woman with addictions and her bad behavior has led to a couple of stints in prison. Now fresh out of the clink, for good behavior, of course, Letty has those good intentions weighing heavily, but the lure of her past lifestyle is often too much to handle and she falls back quite easily into that life. Like butter. Good Behavior is a series of 3 novellas that chronicle the tribulations of Letty. As I've stated before, Letty does have some good intentions most of the time, especially where it concerns her son, and she really does want to change. Crouch did a fantastic job creating such a juxtaposed character with Letty, and I adore that despite her often terrible choices in life, he showcased her willingness to at least try to turn her life around. Trying doesn't mean she's successful, but it does show that she is fully aware of the pain-filled consequences of her choices. I'm not sure if I'd want a straight-and-narrow Letty anyhow, bad Letty is so much better :)Highly recommended, and I'm certainly sad that these three novellas are the end of Letty Dobesh. But no worries, Good Behavior has become a TV show and I can continue to get my Letty fix that way.*eARC received via NetGalley in exchange for my honest opinion."}, {"userName": "Kira", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7247640-kira", "userReview": "Good Behavior is a collection of three novellas about Letty Dobesh. Letty is a fascinating character. She's a recovering drug addict but can't quite kick her addiction to thievery. These novellas were amazing! Each of them had an ending that was surprising. The first novella will be very familiar if you've seen the first episode of the show, but it ended differently. The second novella was twisted. Letty's involvement in the heist was not at all what I expected. The third novella was also depicted in the show but only parts of it. The best part of the novella wasn't included in the show. The level of deception a certain character went to blew me away. I hope that is included in the show at some point.I had watched several episodes of the show before reading this. It's different but not. Blake Crouch writes for the show as well, so despite them being different Letty is the same. She is the reason I love it. Then again I have a thing for characters with shades of grey. Reading this book gave more insight to her character. I hope more novellas or better yet a book will be written about her. If not, I'll gladly settle for the show."}, {"userName": "Liz", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4125660-liz", "userReview": "I received this ARC from netgalley and Thomas & Mercer. I was curious about it as it's the basis for the new TNT show starring Michele Dockery. Now I guess I should have read the description better because it is not a single storyline. The first 20% of the book is in essence the pilot episode. Then comes an insert from the author describing where initial story and show depart company. Then there are two more stories based on the TV show characters. I really like Letty, the main character and her dilemma in the first story. Talk about a bad time to develop a conscience. She has her issues. She's a meth addict, an ex-con who is also a very good thief. The stories aren't really connected except by Letty. In the same way that a tv show has a different plot for each episode, these stories are stand alone. The stories are not deep. Again, you see they were written more as screenplays than novellas. Don't go in looking for anything complex and you'll enjoy them.

Good behavior is actually three Novellas: The Pain of Others, Sunset Key, and The Grab. But this book is not just a combination of these three Novellas. This book is about the writing process and the new show coming out called \"Good Behavior\" Blake Crouch writes about his character Letty, collaborating with Chad Hodge, co-writing the script for the television show and was their collaborative process.The Pain of others begins with Letty starting anew after her incarceration. She no longer has custody of her young child and has a on again off again drug problem. She is also a thief. She is currently working a hotel, entering hotel rooms in order to steal from the occupants when an occupant comes back early and she hears about an upcoming crime. At what point does a criminal herself draw the line? Letty has found hers and decides to intervene. But she learns maybe sticking your nose in other people's business may not be the best solution.In Sunset Key, we see Letty has fallen apart, she is using and has not eaten in days. She is given an opportunity to make some money. In order to do so, she needs to get herself together and literally and figuratively clean up her act. She is hired to spend time with a wealthy man who is scheduled to report to jail the next day. She is supposed to rob him and meet her handler at a rendezvous point. But what happens when she is double crossed and the tables have turned on her. This, by the way, was my favorite of the Novellas. I also really liked how Crouch shared how he came up with the story.In the Grab, Letty has decided to go visit her son on the west coast. While traveling across county, she is approached about joining a team that has plans to pull off a casino heist. She decides to join them and make some money before traveling on to see her son. While in Las Vegas, she sees her drug counselor who appears to have hit rock bottom himself. She finds herself trying to help him as he has helped her while participating in the heist. Once again this is a story where Letty learns that not everyone is as they seem, double crosses happen and allegiances are made. This is a very fast based book to read as it contains novellas. All are full of action and dialogue which makes the stories fast paced. I enjoyed them. This is a perfect introduction to the character of Letty and a lead in to the television show. It is also nice to read Crouch's thoughts on his character, how he writes, where he gets ideas and what goes into writing a script.This book also serves as a nice introduction to Blake Crouch's writing for those who have not read a Blake Crouch book (btw shame on your for not reading Crouch before!). This is not a typical Blake Crouch book but once again allows his storytelling to shine.To see more of my reviews visit www.openbookpost.com"}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4148745-nancy", "userReview": "Letty Dobesh is a convicted thief and a drug addict and just out of prison but she hasn't been reformed. This is a collection of three fun stand alone novellas (The Pain of Others, Sunset Key, and Grab) by Blake Crouch. According to Blake Crouch's website (http://www.blakecrouch.com/letty-dobe...), Letty is his favorite character of all time and I can see why. Each novella is a fast-paced thrill ride that will keep you guessing on how it will end. In The Pain of Others Letty is robbing hotel rooms when she find herself hiding in closet and over hearing a killer for hire. She is faced the decision of either saving the intended victim and risk going back to jail or going along her merry way and forget she heard anything.In Sunset Key Letty is tasked with stealing a priceless painting while posing as a high paid escort from a wealthy CEO's private island the night before he goes to jail for securities fraud.Lastly, in Grab Letty, on her way to see her son, takes a detour to Las Vegas to rob a casino for a once in a lifetime score. Each story is easy to read, fast-paced, and delivers a solid plot. The book has an introduction by Crouch and at the end of each novella there is some extra background information on the story and writing the new TNT television series coming out. These are nice little extras.

Many people have expressed disappointment that it wasn't in the same league as Dark Matter and I will admit that that was my first instinct as well, but I don't think that it's necessarily a bad thing. After reading all three of the novellas, I think that they were written exactly as they needed be in Letty's world. We are reading about a woman who is a meth addict, an alcoholic, a criminal and let's face it, rather white trash. It's not poetic, it's not snow-falling-on-street-lights-pretty, it's Letty slumming in nasty motels, sleeping with sketchy guys, and trying her best not to end up a statistic and in that, I think that Crouch coins it pretty well.

This book is a collection of 3 short stories centering around the main character of Lettie Dobesh. Good Behavior is slotted to become a television series in November, so I was really excited to read this book. One of the interesting things about this book is that after each story, Crouch gives some inside information on how each story is adapted for the TV series. One of my biggest pet peeves is when books are made into movies or televisions series and they stray too far from the integrity of the original story. However, having the authors notes explaining the adaptations makes me even more interested in watching the show to see how they pull everything off. I am hoping in the future that there will be more Lettie stories, because I was sad to see this book end. And to keep the seasons of the TV show going.
