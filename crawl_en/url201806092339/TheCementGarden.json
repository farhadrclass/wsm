Well, my true guess is no, for they sure do captivate (lookin' atchu V.C. Andrews [R.I.P., girl]!). Another case in point: this early novel from major Nobel contender (I'm certain of this, right?) Ian McEwan. \"The Cement Garden\" is considered by critics to be \"Lord of the Flies\"-like in its plot structure and because it contains young protagonists. But I must venture to say that it mostly resembles an early version of Bertolucci's \"Dreamers\" (of course by that I mean its novel predecessor)-- this is similarly an enchanted but truly megagrueling experience. After \"Atonement\", \"Cement Garden\" takes second place in the Maestro of English Prose's impressive (though uneven) repertoire."}, {"userName": "Wen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8686221-wen", "userReview": "This was McEwan\u2019s very first novel, which earned him the fame and the nickname Ian Macabre. It was narrated by a 15-year-old boy on his life with his three young siblings in a secluded big house shortly after the death of both parents. They grew up in an isolated and dysfunctional family. The lack of adult supervision and sexual experiences, and the yearning for kinship while desiring individual space, led them to explorations and experiments that beyond inexplicable. It was haunting and disturbing to say the least. Comparing to his later works I\u2019ve read, it was simpler, more straightforward storytelling, but similarly atmospheric, with equally skilled character craftsmanship. I felt his prose was smooth, but not quite as dazzling as in his more recent books."}, {"userName": "Tatiana", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2250020-tatiana", "userReview": "Will it reflect badly on me if I say this book isn't sordid enough to be entertaining or truly affecting? Considering how unsettling and uncomfortable it already is?Four siblings, ranging from 6 to 17, who have too close for comfort of a relationship (if the word \"incest\" flashed in you mind, you are correct - it is not a spoiler, the \"action\" starts on page 2), witness both their parents die within the weeks of each other. When their mother dies, they make a decision to bury her in the cellar and to not tell anyone, to keep their family intact. Left to their own devices, these children go through the motions of playing house and, you guessed it, they don't do it very well.The Cement Garden gives a predictably disturbing and occasionally icky picture of what can happen to kids isolated from the community and unsupervised by adults. As much as I hate reading about incest, especially when it is written as some romantic device or for melodramatic effect, here it is strangely understandable, albeit not less gross. However, the novel didn't quite work for me. I thought there was more to say about the family, the kids' parents, their path to such a taboo closeness. The point the author was trying to make with this story evaded me. I just didn't quite get it or even if I did, the novel failed to affect me as much as Atonement and On Chesil Beach did in the past. It happens rather often when I read McEwan though."}, {"userName": "Jared Duran", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/282287-jared-duran", "userReview": "Ian McEwan's The Cement Garden is, quite clearly not for everyone. There are several severely disturbing incidents throughout the book that might make some readers wonder why they bought it, and where is the nearest bookstore to return it? There are other groups both of a religious/fascist nature (the two are not always mutually exclusive) that might have it pencilled in on their \"things to burn\" list. In the hands of a lesser writer, much of this book would seem vulgar. However, in McEwan's capable hands the book is instead disturbingly beautiful. The book is very short, and to say almost anything about it is to give almost everything away, so you will find no excerpts or plot points in this review. Suffice to say that The Cement Garden is a brilliant, gripping read that feels like it's over before it began."}, {"userName": "Betsy Robinson", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5149179-betsy-robinson", "userReview": "Told in straight-forward sentences, this first novel reads like a very good writer\u2019s memoir. I love the deep truth of some pretty extreme behavior by a family of orphaned siblings, which portends the even more sophisticated truths of oblique human behavior in later books. There is none of the lyricism or solid chapters of inner dialogue that characterize McEwan\u2019s style today. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t start with this book, because now that I am an ardent fan, it was even more interesting to see where he began."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/512643-michelle", "userReview": "This book is fucked-up, sick, and creepy...I loved it. I love McEwan's style. He doesn't clutter his writing with unnecessary words, yet he says so much. His writing is sharp and clean. He is so good at invoking a specific mood at the very beginning of a novel, and then continuing to give the reader that same feeling throughout. Then, just when you're sufficiently creeped out or unnerved or whatever it is you've been feeling, it gets even more intense. The book is a first-person narrative told by the eldest son of a family of four children. Two boys and two girls. It describes what the children do with themselves when both of their parents die relatively close to one another. The kids are already insular and strange, and we see how they deal with caring for themselves and their surroundings. We also see how their roles and interactions with each other change after the second parent dies. I don't want to give anything more away, but I want to say that I like it when a book unnerves me, and this did the job."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65909643-michael", "userReview": "3.5*, rounded up.

(It was preceded by an even more shocking collection of short stories, \"First Love, Last Rights\", https://www.goodreads.com/review/show....)A profoundly disturbing, but very well written book. Had I realised the true nature of it, I doubt I would have read it, and somehow the fact it is told in such an unjudgemental way almost makes it worse.\"I did not kill my father, but I sometimes think I helped him on his way\", is the opening sentence. It is set in a hot summer in late '70s England. Four children live a rather isolated life in a very insular and not entirely happy family. Their father dies, and not long after, so does their mother (this much is mentioned in the blurb), leaving them to fend for themselves and each other. Tom is 5 or 6, Sue 12, Jack (the narrator) turns 15 and Julie about 16 or 17. Bereaved, fearful, lonely, unprepared, bored (school holidays), directionless, coupled with puberty and sibling squabbles. Each tries different coping strategies, none of which really work: shy Julie (previously with a reputation for \"disruptive, intimidating quietness\") takes charge, Sue reads and also writes a diary, Tom regresses (a cot delivers \"an enveloping pleasure in being tenderly imprisoned\"), and Jack... retreats and masturbates. But those behaviours are trivial in comparison to other actions.They lose sense of time, self and not just right and wrong, but what the rest of the world would judge as right and wrong: \"Nor could I think whether what we had done was an ordinary thing to do, understandable even if it had been a mistake, or something so strange that if it was ever found out it would be the headline of every newspaper in the country... every thought I had dissolved into nothing.\"I found the story gripping and oddly credible, and yet I was appalled by it too - a little like Lolita."}, {"userName": "Ilenia Zodiaco", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18922532-ilenia-zodiaco", "userReview": "Morboso il tema, come sempre elegante, senza per questo smettere di turbare, la ricostruzione di McEwan.

For years afterwards it stayed high on my list of all-time favorites. I haven't seen it again since then, though, so I have no idea what I'd think now, but at the time I just thought it was the greatest thing ever. Incest! Allegory. Incest! Foreigners! Incest! Cement. Incest! Adolescence. Tragedy! Incest! What more do you want from a film at age fifteen?Reading this book was definitely colored by my long-ago experience of the movie, and it was impossible for me to tell to what extent. To me, this book read like a screenplay. All the characters, locations, and action seemed very cinematic, in a good way. I think it's very funny that this was originally marketed as a sensationalistic horror novel, though I guess that makes a certain kind of sense. I mean, it's a little macabre, in its way, I suppose. I really did like it a lot, though some of that must have to do with the thrill I got knowing that even Ian McEwan had to start somewhere. I actually thought this was very well-written, but it was still like looking at the pimply, gangly, compulsively masturbating adolescent who will someday blossom into a distinguished grey-haired, smirking master of the English sentence. To think, the universally acclaimed sex-pervert novelist who wrote Atonement was once a smug-looking first-time novelist in a macrame vest! This should give us all hope.I really liked this book, and I might give it four stars. It is one of the ones where you really feel like you're in the place he's describing and can see all the people, and that's worth real points where I come from. I think I'm just holding him to a higher standard because he's Ian McEwan, also because lately I'm just giving everything three stars because.... that's just sort of how I'm feeling these days. Oh, and it was flawed. I mean, I'm pretty sure it was. But I'm so confused by having seen the movie at one point that I don't feel I can talk about this book with any authority."}, {"userName": "l a i n e y", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10752235-l-a-i-n-e-y", "userReview": "[burial and those cellar scenes.

Coetzee to readers who enjoyed this, because my experience of J.M. Coetzee was similar to my experience with this book, which was \"Yes, a very good writer but ewwwwwwww!\"I have not read Ian McEwan before, and if all his books are like this, I'm unlikely to try him again. I don't mind a disturbing book with unlikable characters who do disgusting things, but you have to give some reason to want to keep reading besides just admiring how skillfully the writer describes these sick, damaged people, and all I thought about as I read The Cement Garden was that I was glad it was short because I wanted to get through it and be done with it.The plot is very simple: four children live alone in an old house after both their parents died. They've managed to keep secret the fact that they're orphans, so rather than be put \"in care\" as the Brits say, they now have the house all to themselves, thanks to regular payments from some account their mother set up before she died which the oldest girl, Julie, collects from the post office.Being a family that was already dysfunctional before their parents died (the older three were already playing incestuous \"doctor\" games), they pretty much turn feral once they no longer have adult supervision. The two girls, Julie and Sue, are relatively \"normal\" in the sense that they can present themselves as ordinary functional human beings; Julie is very pretty, is the only one who goes out, and soon she has a \"bloke,\" an older man who is bound to bring complications into this tidy arrangement. Sue, the second-youngest, spends all her time scribing grim thoughts in her journal.Meanwhile, Jack, the first person narrator, stops bathing or changing his clothes, and much of the book is spent dwelling on the details of the filth beneath his fingernails, his acne, and his masturbatory habits, this being pretty much his sole pastime aside from slouching around the house inflicting his stench and his bad attitude on his siblings. Tom, the youngest boy, bullied at school, first decides he wants to be a girl, because girls don't get hit (his sisters try to disabuse him of this notion, to no avail, but then encourage him in his cross-dressing), and then decides he wants to be a baby again, which Julie cheerfully facilitates.Meanwhile, Jack is clearly obsessed with older sister Julie in a non-fraternal way, and while Julie seems normal, even motherly, on the surface, being what passes for the voice of reason and authority in this broken household with dishes moldering in the kitchen, she clearly enjoys the power she has over her brother and is learning how to subtly push those buttons.It is hard to imagine any of these creatures growing up psychologically healthy.Their dystopian Never Never Land might go on indefinitely, except that there is a little secret in their cellar, hinted at by the title, and since none of the kids are big on smarts or planning, it is bound to end badly.By the end of the book I was about as grossed out as I have ever been by a book not written by Robert Heinlein or Piers Anthony.My problem, and the reason I am giving The Cement Garden 2 stars despite being written by a Man Booker Prize winner, is that I failed to see the point and utterly failed to enjoy anything about it. It's a macabre, almost gothic tale set in that grim, stark English urban landscape that Pink Floyd was singing about back about the same time McEwan wrote this. It's skillful and unsettling and maybe that's all McEwan intended, and surely there are people who like books that exist only to twist all their revulsion dials. But I wanted to drink bleach after reading this, and I'm only giving it 2 stars rather than 1 because I cannot deny it's very well-written and very effective at impacting the reader."}, {"userName": "Stela", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2585926-stela", "userReview": "Concrete CivilisationIan McEwan\u2019s Cement Garden left me with the same feelings I had after reading William Golding\u2019s Lord of the Flies. I was aware of their resemblance right from the beginning, not in the sense of an imitation, of course, far from it, but in the choice of the theme and the way to develop it. Both books argue about the famous nature versus nurture, showing how thin the shell of civilization is, how easy social conventions are forgotten when the link with society is broken. And the childhood is the most ill-equipped to prevent this involution, since childhood is no secret garden, the authors warn us, but a dangerous hunting ground, be it an island or a shabby house, haunted by invisible monsters born of nightmares, transforming a sow\u2019s head eaten by flies in a powerful Lord and a cement-filled trunk full of indiscrete cracks in a eerie garden. In the absence of the adults to sanction their moves and beliefs, children regress to primitive beings, barely human despite their efforts to imitate adulthood. However, if Golding analysed mainly the gregarious psychology and the penchant for cruelty versus assertion of individuality and compassion, McEwan is interested in the crumble of the family values in all Freudian ways possible \u2013 parricide, incest, sex confusion, regression to infancy, as results of parental abuse and isolation, as it is suggested right from the beginning by the fifteen-year-old narrator:I did not kill my father, but I sometimes felt I had helped him on his way.The story of the four siblings taking care of themselves after their parents\u2019 death is, symbolically, the story of the world after the apocalypse, when none of the old constraints and values is applicable. The cement garden gains thus a triple significance: it refers either to the monstrous garden built by an obsessive, abusive and tasteless father, and to the ad-hoc grave of a submissive, without authority and ignorant mother and to the barren, catastrophic childhood of the protagonists left alone to discover that beings are interchangeable and rules are confusing and altogether futile in a world that gained the attributes of a perpetual, out of time nightmare:'It's funny,' Julie said, 'I've lost all sense of time. It feels like it's always been like this. I can't really remember how it used to be when Mum was alive and I can't really imagine anything changing. Everything seems still and fixed and it makes me feel that I'm not frightened of anything.'I said, 'Except for the times I go down into the cellar I feel like I'm asleep. Whole weeks go by without me noticing, and if you asked me what happened three days ago I wouldn't be able to tell you.'In the end, however, again like in Lord of the Flies, the adults come back and the order is restored. Or is it? For the return to a society that will surely discipline them into the image of their awful parents is no happy ending in the dismally fascinating worlds, so different and so alike, these two great writers have created."}, {"userName": "Teresa Proen\u00e7a", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6923777-teresa-proen-a", "userReview": "[O narrador \u00e9 um adolescente (sempre com a m\u00e3o dentro das cuecas) que vive com os pais, um irm\u00e3o e duas irm\u00e3s (com as quais brinca aos m\u00e9dicos).

If I want to sample an author, I go straight to his/her most famous work. If I like it, I read 2-3 more of his popular ones and if I still like them, that\u2019s the only time I go to his or her earlier works then probably do the reading chronologically. Of course, I am talking here of authors that have more than 5 works to their name and did not get international fame in their very first or only book. This is what\u2019s been happening with me and Ian McEwan\u2019s books. I first read Enduring Love since it is a 501 book. I gave it a 5 star. Next was his Booker awardee, Amsterdam and gave it a 4 star. Then, I picked up what his fans are saying as his masterpiece, Atonement and gave it a 5 star. Then I moved to his saddest (so far) book, A Child in Time and gave it another 5 star. I am now determined to read all his works before I die. I am now a certified McEwan fan. With the rate I am going, I will be a completist for him and it will be my first.In 2008, Ian Russell McEwan (born 1948) was named as one of The 50 greatest British writers since 1945 by The Times. His two latest works, On Chesil Beach (2007) and Solar (2010) are not at par with his earlier works according to literary critics. So, I am not reading them yet. Some novels need more time for people to see their worth so I am not bothered. McEwan\u2019s earlier 2 books that earned him the title \u201cIan Macabre\u201d did not become immediate bestsellers too but enough for him to get noticed despite having that title. Those two books are The Cement Garden (1978) and The Comfort of Strangers (1981). This review is about the first one, Cement and I really liked it still.Going back to your favorite author\u2019s earlier works is like seeing Brad Pitt in a 1991 movie, Thelma and Louise. Brad Pitt did a cameo role but his role and his looks almost stole the movie from Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon. Unadulterated Brad Pitt: without gimmicks, not in an epic role, no high powered gun, and with no girlfriend with pouty lips by his side. Just like Ian McEwan in Cement. It is slim plain storytelling of 4 kids orphaned at their very young age: Julie (17), Jack the narrator (15), Sue (13) and Tom (6). When the story opens, the father is gardening and 2 pages after, he dies. Then 10 pages or so, the sickly mother dies too. Because they are still young and they don\u2019t want to live apart and stay in orphanages, they bury their mother in their cellar. I will not tell you the rest of the story as I do not want to spoil your fun. With that plot, I can now see where McEwan got the title of \u201cIan Macabre\u201d.The story does not introduce you to mind-bogging syndrome like \"de Clerambault\u2019s\" (Enduring Love). Neither does it make you aware of the politics nor role of media (Amsterdam). It does not have a grandiose backdrop like WWII or that big revelation like Briony\u2019s secret or guilt (Atonement). It does not dwell on father\u2019s sadness and longing that brings forth his own experience as a child (A Child In Time). Cement is like going back many steps backward and finding McEwan\u2019s core: brilliant storytelling without unnecessary pizzazz. You will love, get amused and cry with the orphaned kids. You will be able to identify yourself in one of them: the take-charge Julie, I-have-no-friend Jack, the diarist Sue or the clueless Tom. They are plain American kids and they don\u2019t know what they are doing like not cleaning their house or eating all junks that they can find in the supermarket. Those, plus that scene towards the end. Just this one point: Among McEwan's works, this one is dark, that's why I liked it.This deserves to stay in the 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die.

Essentially, McEwan has constructed an urban \"Lord of the Flies.\" Intermingled with themes of social isolation and adolescent sexuality, Freud's Oedipal complex looms large throughout an uneasy psychological tale of a family's dysfunction.Jack, the fifteen year old son, one of four children, is the narrator. This is the opening sentence: \"I did not kill my father, but I sometimes felt I had helped him on his way. And but for the fact that it coincided with a landmark in my own physical growth, his death seemed insignificant compared with what followed.\"That landmark in physical growth is Jack's first ejaculation which he accomplishes while Da is busily cementing over the yard out of a sense of efficiency. Perhaps if Jack hadn't been involved in that act of self discovery, poor Da wouldn't have ended up face down in a puddle of wet cement.Jack psychically erases the existence of his father by smoothing his impression in the cement away after the corpse is carried away by ambulance. There is no grieving process that follows. Death is something that simply happens and must be accepted. What follows is simply told in a straight forward manner. Shortly after the unnamed father dies of a heart attack, the mother dies of a lingering illness. To Jack and Julie, the oldest, it seemed so obvious at the time to hide their mother's death to remain together. The solution? Cover Mum in a trunk with cement down in the cellar.Julie is seventeen. She is the obvious choice to become head of the family. Jack resents her assertion of authority. Sue, thirteen, keeps a secret diary, recording their lives, although the reader is only supplied with the briefest of glimpses when she reads a small bit to Jack. Tommy, only four, decides it would be better to become a girl. His sisters readily take to the idea, outfitting him with a wig, blouses and skirts.As time passes, with no parent on the scene, Tommy regresses to being a baby once more. Julie puts up the old baby crib in her room, assuming the role of mother to the degree she is able, which isn't much, to put it simply.Inevitably, Mum's death cannot be hidden. There's a crack in the cement covering her body. The sweet sick smell of death permeates the house.When Julie brings home a boyfriend, Derek, things are going to fall apart. McEwan's gloomy tale skids to a tumultuous climax. This bleak novel is a precise portrait of the grotesque. This is not a book lightly read nor easily forgotten. The subject matter is not pleasant, nor is it meant to be. One turns the page with a degree of squeamishness, but also fascination, as the facts unfold through Jack's unblinking and unrelenting perspective.McEwan's subsequent three novels in conjunction with the darkness of this story earned him the reputation of being \"Ian McAbre.\" However, in \"The Cement Garden,\" the reader sees the origin of the author who would win the Booker with \"Amsterdam,\" and the writer of the widely read \"Atonement.\" This is one to add to your read stack if you've not already done so."}, {"userName": "Will", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5072847-will", "userReview": "This was his first novel; it arrived with rave reviews, though to me it seems rather restrained and a little too short. It certainly has an air of unease about it, but I wouldn\u2019t say actual menace; it is more sad and claustrophobic, and (for McEwan) only a little macabre. Jack, his two sisters and much younger brother are orphaned when his father has an accident while concreting over the garden and shortly after the funeral his mother falls ill and dies. The children don\u2019t as much decide to entomb her body in leftover cement as pretend that nothing has changed.  The story unfolds through the typical self-centred view of a 15-year-old boy, barely aware of the changing family dynamics where his sisters have taken over. The older Julie (for whom Jack has an obsession) has become the authoritarian parent while the younger Sue is more the passive partner and diarist, while 6-year-old Tom regresses to a baby. Over one summer, their world shrinks to the four of them and the unmentionable smell in the basement, but inevitably an outsider, Julie\u2019s rather wet boyfriend Derek, becomes aware of what\u2019s going on and their world collapses. It\u2019s rather touching how Derek feels hurt and excluded from the dysfunctional and incestuous family, which seems to be the real reason he calls the authorities. I quite liked this one - 3 1/2 stars anyway - but I\u2019ve been reading a fair bit of McEwan recently and as I think of him as one of my favourite authors, I\u2019m starting to wonder why I gave most of his works only 3-4 stars? Maybe my 5-star category is too exclusive!"}, {"userName": "Evan", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1248986-evan", "userReview": "I came to this book via the excellent 1993 movie version that starred Charlotte Gainsbourg, the gamine, androgynous French actress whose odd beauty -- inherited from her eccentric composer father, Serge, and her svelte model mother Jane Birkin -- I admit an attraction to. As usual she dropped trou in the movie, so I was not disappointed.Gainsbourg was about 21 when she made the film, but was portraying a 16 or 17-year-old adolescent or thereabouts, and looked the part; her character, Julie, seemed to be the focal point of the movie.In the book Julie is certainly a strong and powerful presence (aging from 15 to 17 as the story progresses) as the nominal head of a family of English orphaned adolescents -- Sue (12), Jack (14) and their very young brother, Tom. But Julie is not the protagonist, Jack is. The book is told entirely from his point of view. In the film, Jack seems an aloof and less important character, mainly a reactive one to Julie, and, indeed in the book as well, he is a distant, shiftless, unhygienic, zit-faced angry adolescent slug. When pressed for something to do, he masturbates, often fantasizing about the body of his older sister. At first, reading this book, I was wishing the story had been told from Julie's point of view, but as I read on and thought about it, I started to appreciate Ian McEwan's strategy and decision to tell his story via a fairly weak protagonist. It's a bold and risky choice to have a story told from the perspective of perhaps the least interesting character in the book. The result is a certain clinical precision, a simplicity of language; and Jack's cluelessness and amorality about what goes on around him allows the reader to appreciate the ironies and overlay whatever moral judgments he or she may desire. The unreliability of Jack as a narrator also comes into question at times when he and Julie disagree on the content of past events.The Cement Garden is a macabre, claustrophobic tale of ennui and gothic horror, but not in the usual sense. There are no murderers or vampires or ghosts afoot. There are only the grotesqueries of time and decay and ignorance and secrets. The cement garden in the story has at least two meanings, and both refer to death.Spoilers won't be given here. But it must be said that the symbolic spectres of dead parents hover over the orphaned children in the book as they inhabit their decaying monolithic house, making up the rules as they go along and fearful of the intrusion of the outside world, a world that might take them away and split them apart at any moment. As they play their bizarre games and accumulate their rank detritus, the smell of death triggers memories of life.Cement is constantly breaking down in the novel, a symbol of the impermanence of human structures and the eventual and inevitable conquest by nature. Tombs and buildings are merely temporal monuments of human hubris. There's a lovely section in the book where Jack, lolling about in demolished prefab houses, ruminates about the temporary nature of buildings; the idea that people once took comfort in spaces that are now open to the merciless sky.The book is very English, a new twist on the old Cold Comfort Farm story with a touch of the Village of the Damned. One very astute review here on GR compared it to Jean Cocteau's Les Enfants Terribles. Frequent comparisons made to Lord of the Flies are also apt, but the changes among the children in The Cement Garden are less dramatic, if indeed there are really any at all.The book explores topics such as masturbation, incest, androgyny, gender roles, socialization in isolation, tribalism, death, memory and more. There is no resolution, no redemption, no easy out in this book. I very much enjoyed this odd, meandering story. I could not put it down, in fact."}, {"userName": "KamRun", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12342179-kamrun", "userReview": "\u0631\u0627\u0648\u06cc \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u063a \u0633\u06cc\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0641\u0631\u0632\u0646\u062f \u062f\u0648\u0645 (\u062c\u06a9) \u06cc\u06a9 \u062e\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0627\u062f\u0647 6 \u0646\u0641\u0631\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u062a. \u062a\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0631 \u062e\u0627\u0646\u0647\u060c \u062d\u06cc\u0627\u0637 \u0648 \u06a9\u0648\u0686\u0647 \u06cc \u0645\u0646\u062a\u0647\u06cc \u0628\u0647 \u062e\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0645\u06cc \u06af\u0630\u0631\u062f. \u0627\u0646\u062f\u06a9\u06cc \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0627\u0632 \u0645\u0631\u06af \u067e\u062f\u0631\u060c \u0645\u0627\u062f\u0631 \u062e\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0627\u062f\u0647 \u0646\u06cc\u0632 \u0645\u06cc \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u062f \u0648 \u0641\u0631\u0632\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0632 \u062a\u0631\u0633 \u0627\u0632 \u0647\u0645 \u067e\u0627\u0634\u06cc\u062f\u0646 \u062e\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0627\u062f\u0647 \u0648 \u062c\u062f\u0627 \u0634\u062f\u0646 \u0627\u0632 \u06cc\u06a9\u062f\u06cc\u06af\u0631\u060c \u0645\u0627\u062f\u0631 \u0631\u0627 \u062f\u0631 \u0635\u0646\u062f\u0648\u0642\u06cc \u062f\u0631 \u0632\u06cc\u0631\u0632\u0645\u06cc\u0646 \u062e\u0627\u0646\u0647\u060c \u0645\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0633\u06cc\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0641\u0646 \u0645\u06cc \u06a9\u0646\u0646\u062f... \u0632\u0627\u0648\u06cc\u0647 \u062f\u06cc\u062f \u0627\u0648\u0644 \u0634\u062e\u0635 \u060c \u0633\u0627\u062f\u06af\u06cc \u0646\u062b\u0631\u060c \u0646\u0642\u0644 \u062e\u0627\u0637\u0631\u0647 \u0648\u0627\u0631 \u0648\u0642\u0627\u06cc\u0639 \u062f\u0631 \u0641\u0636\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u062f\u0644\u0647\u0631\u0647 \u0622\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0632 \u0639\u0648\u0627\u0645\u0644 \u062c\u0630\u0627\u0628\u06cc\u062a \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a. \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0631\u062a\u0628\u0627\u0637 \u0628\u0627 \u0633\u0627\u0646\u0633\u0648\u0631 \u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645\u0647 \u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u0639\u062b \u062a\u063a\u06cc\u06cc\u0631 \u0641\u0627\u062d\u0634 \u062f\u0631 \u0633\u0627\u062e\u062a\u0627\u0631 \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0634\u062f\u0647\u060c \u067e\u06cc\u0634 \u0627\u0632 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0645\u0637\u0627\u0644\u0628\u06cc \u0634\u0646\u06cc\u062f\u0647 \u0628\u0648\u062f\u0645 \u0648 \u062f\u0631 \u062d\u06cc\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0646 \u0645\u062a\u0646 \u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc \u0646\u06cc\u0632 \u0645\u062a\u0648\u062c\u0647 \u0628\u0631\u06cc\u062f\u0647 \u0634\u062f\u0646 \u0642\u0633\u0645\u062a \u0647\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u0645\u062a\u0646 \u0634\u062f\u0645. \u0628\u0627 \u0645\u0642\u0627\u06cc\u0633\u0647 \u0627\u06cc \u06af\u0630\u0631\u0627 \u0645\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u062a\u0646 \u0627\u0635\u0644\u06cc \u0648 \u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645\u0647 \u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc \u0645\u0634\u062e\u0635 \u0634\u062f \u06a9\u0647 \u06a9\u06cc\u0641\u06cc\u062a \u0627\u0631\u062a\u0628\u0627\u0637 \u062c\u06a9 \u0648 \u062c\u0648\u0644\u06cc (\u062e\u0648\u0627\u0647\u0631 \u0648 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u062f\u0631) \u062f\u0631 \u0637\u0648\u0644 \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0633\u0627\u0646\u0633\u0648\u0631 \u0648 \u062a\u0645 \u0627\u0631\u0648\u062a\u06cc\u06a9 \u0628\u062e\u0634\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u0627\u0645\u0644\u0627 \u062d\u0630\u0641 \u0634\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0633\u062aShe lifted herself slightly and sank down.

It was a bit mixed but I've marked it high for reasons I'll try to explain. The main character is a self-centered brute, but they're all pretty screwed up and emotionally damaged. The big taboos it deals with stick out eagerly begging to be broken. Feels like this was written by someone trying very hard to shock, and it does this with varying effect. It's still a very odd story, don't get me wrong, but it's also desperately sad. Beautiful writing raises this up from outright pulp, which I guess is the point - it's occasionally graphic, shameless with grimy detail of frustrated, callous adolescence. I think that above all, this gave me a sense of wish-fulfilment for the protagonist, Jack.

Finishing the novella in the cold light of day, I find it remarkably creepy. McEwan achieves perfect pitch. I dare say he strikes closer to The Destructors by Greene than anything else. Many people cited Lord of the Flies as a cousin (no pun intended) but that harrowing tale is reductively feral whereas the trauma of Cement Garden and Graham's lads gone wild remain so coldly industrial.I saw the film in the mid-90s and it bothered me.

The implied incestuous activity between the siblings makes one both uncomfortable yet oddly sympathetic. it is not out of sexual attraction that these actions occur, but with the pure necessity of being wanted; being held - simple actions which cannot be fulfilled by the tragically deceased parents. Julie's clear unease about sexual intimacy with her boyfriend and yet complete nonchalance about her sexual activity with her brother are not necessarily presented to be wrong, but are criticized and dismissed as \"sick\" by her boyfriend Derek. It is this which leads me to view Derek as a representation of society as a whole - their ideals, opinions of what constitutes \"love\", \"beauty\", and \"success\". With his flash car and annoyingly expensive clothes, Derek is a loathsome character who shows a complete lack of interest in anything other than himself. He is superficial. And whilst incest is obviously not socially accepted, McEwan deals with it sensitively. People perhaps do not think what drives siblings to an act which, to most people, the thought of is enough to cause deep repulsion. I am not condoning or promoting incest, but appreciate the delicacy with which McEwan has managed to examine it."}, {"userName": "Patricia Kaiser", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52021036-patricia-kaiser", "userReview": "A great first book of 2018 with a gripping story told in Ian McEwan\u2019s unique style. Spent an interesting evening on my couch with \u2018The Cement Garden\u2019 and love that I\u2019ve read one more book by one of my most favourite authors. After being so disappointed by \u2018Nutshell\u2019, the latest McEwan I\u2019ve read, \u2018The Cement Garden\u2019 was once again perfect for me. The creepy story mixed with weird characters is exactly what I\u2019m looking for in a book. Considering the fact that this is the story of four children, all deeply influenced by their parent\u2019s death, the story focused too much on Jack and Julie whilst you learn hardly anything about Sue\u2019s and Tom\u2019s feelings."}, {"userName": "Bruce", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1207684-bruce", "userReview": "I have read and enjoyed many of McEwan\u2019s novels, but most of those have been written in the past decade. I was interested in reading this, his first published novel, and comparing it with his later work. The one was published when McEwan was thirty years old in 1978 and had been preceded by a collection of short stories.The story is simply told although clearly very odd. Four children ranging in age from 6 to 16 are orphaned rather suddenly. There seem to be no relatives and essentially no social contacts of significance. Fearing that they will be separated and place in foster care, they bury their mother, the second parent to die, in concrete in the basement and try to carry on with life as best they can, which is not well. Each must first of all deal with the psychological trauma related to what has occurred, and then collectively they must work together to run a household. The second eldest, Jack, who narrates the story, is the most clearly delineated of the lot, but his primary characteristics seem to be his determination to defy the social norms of cleanliness and his burgeoning sexuality focusing on masturbation and his sexual fascination with his older sister, Julie. But each of his siblings has his and her own bizarre and dysfunctional way of dealing with a family situation that is coming apart.I found it interesting to reflect on how a thirty year old author might deal with these issues and wonder how McEwan might deal with them were he writing the novel today. Some of psychological perceptions are acute, generally rather Freudian, but the short novel lacks the sophistication and subtlety of much of his later work. It is important, I think, in order for a novel like this to \u201cwork,\u201d that the reader be led to ponder the reasons for each character\u2019s reactions to adverse circumstances, and I sensed that McEwan was more interested in simply presenting the children as bizarre, focusing on their non-adaptive ways of coping primarily for the voyeuristic sensation rather than with genuine sympathy."}, {"userName": "Sahel Ebrahimi", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41774268-sahel-ebrahimi", "userReview": "Teenagehood psychological problems and desires, lonliness, frustration, perplexed mind and isolation.
