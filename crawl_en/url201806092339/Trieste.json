She is surrounded by documents, photographs, cuttings. Her head is swarming with memories, \u201cmelting in her mind like chocolate\u201d. It should be remembered that Trieste was one of those places which was a disputed territory in both world wars. A kind of no-man\u2019s land perennially awaiting the outcome of some new military action. Its inhabitants never quite sure of where they belonged, pressed in by borders that were continually shifting around them. In short, it\u2019s an inspired place to set a novel about the horrors of world war two. Haya\u2019s story is constructed piece by piece with frequent brilliantly researched documentary interludes. The artistry with which this novel moves back and forth between the personal and the public, a microcosm and a macrocosm of the Holocaust is, for the most part, brilliant. Haya\u2019s story is told with a kind of disarming playful lyricism at times which reminded me of Nicole Krauss but without Krauss\u2019 whimsy, her artificial sweeteners (which I enjoy) . We learn about Haya\u2019s family\u2019s displacement during the first world war. We learn that, like most Italian Jews, they are integrated into Italian life and do not identify themselves primarily as Jewish. To outsiders they are essentially indistinguishable from any other local resident. We see how they are forced by events to become nomads. Work takes them to Albania, Milan, Naples, Venice and Trieste. The hub of the novel is Haya\u2019s relationship with a seemingly and, relatively speaking, innocent German soldier who is also a keen photographer. Haya is a typical young girl. Wilfully ignorant. While transports are leaving Trieste in the middle of the night she is often to be found at the cinema or dining in a trattoria. (Drndic is very tough on Haya and her family: \u201cThe Tedeschi family are a civilian family, bystanders who keep their mouths shut, but when they do speak, they sign up to fascism. For 60 years now these blind observers have been pounding their chests and shouting we are innocent because we didn\u2019t know!\u2026these yes men, these enablers of evil.\u201d) Kurt Franz, the German boyfriend, leaves her when she is pregnant. A year later her son mysteriously vanishes when her back is turned. The central mystery of the novel is what happened to her son. The personal horror of the novel is the gradual unfurling of who his father was, what he did.  There\u2019s a sense we\u2019ve become a little immunised to the horrors of the Holocaust. This novel rips through all those palliatives. It adds new horrors to the Holocaust. Some of the things you learn are as disturbing as anything you already know. I won\u2019t spill any beans because these details are very much an integral part of the novel\u2019s emotional charge. You also learn a few more light-hearted facts like, for example, how when Mussolini\u2019s Ministry of Culture clamped down on the infiltration of foreign words into the Italian language they forbade Italians to refer to Louis Armstrong by his American name; instead he had to be called Luigi Braccioforte! More unsettling we discover that the Swiss allowed the transport trains to pass through their territory when the Brenner tunnel was snowed up on the provision that the Red Cross be allowed to serve the prisoners hot soup and coffee. I read some of the other reviews of this and noticed one person objected to the Nuremburg transcriptions and especially the list of the 9,000 Jews deported from Italy. I found this list very moving because you knew every one of those people had a deeply moving human story like Haya\u2019s. And you don\u2019t have to read every name on the list so this seemed a rather querulous complaint. There might be a case for complaining that, at times, the documentary dwarfed the human story of Haya; that perhaps one didn\u2019t quite get to know Haya as much as one would have liked and occasionally the large scale narrative detracted rather than added to the momentum of the small scale narrative. Personally, for example, I found the quoting of Pound, Borges, Shakespeare, Eliot and others clumsy rather than illuminating. But this is a small misgiving. There\u2019s also a fabulous twist when, late in the novel, we learn who is narrating the novel. This is without question one of the most painful novels I\u2019ve ever read. It\u2019s no Schindler\u2019s List, softening the horror with acts of moving kindness. There\u2019s nothing uplifting about this narrative - except the artistry with which it\u2019s constructed."}, {"userName": "Elyse", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse", "userReview": "Trieste is a city and seaport in northeastern Italy situated towards the end of the narrow strip of Italian territory lying between the Adriatic Sea and Slovenia. This book by Dasa Drndic, had me 'google-reading' about the ancient history, the Middle Ages, the early modern days, 19th century, 20th century, ....WWI, annexation to Italy and the Fascist area, WWII and the aftermath, and the Zone A of the Free Territory of Trieste in 1947-54. Any reader who loves storytelling -- will be enchanted at the start of this novel. Haya Tedeschi, was born in 1923, in Gorizia....a time when the town and the whole region became officially part of Italy. Haya, reflects back on her Catholicized Jewish family's experiences. She's sitting in a rocking chair surrounded by a basket of photographs and newspaper clippings. Haya was waiting to be reunited with her son after sixty-two years, fathered by an SS officer and stolen from her by the Germans authorities. --part of Heinrich Himmler's clandestine Lebensborn project founded in 1935....( outlaws of intermarriage with Jews and others who were considered inferior). Children who were born by an interracial couple were believed to grow up to lead a Nazi-Aryan nation.  \"I got in touch with the Red Cross. I hoped The Red Cross would help me find my grandparents' names. I might have relatives. I might have nephews. My mother had six brothers. My grandmother was a gypsy from Hungary and my grandfather was from Yugoslavia. I believe I have hundreds of brothers and sisters. Who knows how many women he slept with, and man who got my mother pregnant? Mother never told me my grandmothers' name. I am German property, because I was made in Germany at the behest of Heinrich Himmler. I was born in Germany, but when the war ended they forced Mary Bozic to take me with her, because they wanted to forget I existed. They did not want to see me. They wanted to forget that I had ever lived, but I'm not giving up. Germany owes me an apology. It owes me compensation. Me and my mother Mary Bozic. I must find out who my family are and where my grandfather and grandmother are buried. Thank you for hearing me out\". In the middle of this book there are 44 pages of about 9,000 names of Jews...( tiny print) ... who were deported from Italy, or killed in Italy or in the countries Italy occupied between 1943 and 1945. \"BEHIND EVERY NAME THERE IS A STORY\"It's 'powerful' to see all these names - each in print!!!!! It kinda does something to you! THIS is TERRIFIC historical novel. The reader gets a taste of the charming city- a cosmopolitan melting pot where at the beginning of the 20th century it was bustling with artist's and philosophers such as James Joyce and Sigmund Freud. Music, fashion, cuisine, politics, fishing, laughing, and the grand love of every day people....Dasa Drndic opened my eyes and gave me an experience of Trieste - past - and present-where I had none. The last chapters especially got to me....they would anyone!! Special thanks to *Violet* for recommending I read this. I bought the hard copy last 'year'. Sorry I took so long to read it.....and forgive me 'again' for going past my 3 sentence goal!!! Still need to try harder or read more average books."}, {"userName": "Kris", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5974610-kris", "userReview": "The review below appears in The Quarterly Conversation, Issue 37: http://quarterlyconversation.com/trie... -------------------------------In the opening passages of Da\u0161a Drndi\u0107\u2019s Trieste, an elderly woman, Haya Tedeschi, sits in a rocking chair in her third story apartment in the Northern Italian town of Gorizia, close to the port of Trieste:Is that the chair whimpering or is it me? She asks the deep emptiness, which, like every emptiness, spreads its putrid cloak in all directions to draw her in, her, the woman rocking, to swallow her, blanket her, swamp her, envelop her, ready her for the rubbish heap where the emptiness, her emptiness, is piling the corpses, already stiffened, of the past.As Drndi\u0107 reiterates throughout the novel, \u201cBehind every name there is a story.\u201d And Haya Tedeschi\u2019s story is draped in death. Born to a Jewish family that converted to Catholicism and tacitly supported the Fascists in Italy, Haya was a bystander to the Holocaust. She attended movies while Jews and partisans were transported to concentration camps; she pored over movie magazines while thousands of Jews and partisans were killed in the former rice mill San Sabba; she attended concerts with her Nazi lover, Oberscharf\u00fchrer Kurt Franz, while families were torn apart. And on April 13, 1945, the Holocaust was brought home to her when her infant son Antonio was stolen out of his stroller. Throughout Trieste, Haya waits for Antonio to be found, to return to her. As she waits, she echoes a refrain from T.S. Eliot\u2019s \u201cThe Waste Land,\u201d \u201cHURRY UP PLEASE IT\u2019S TIME.\u201dIn the novel\u2019s epigraph, Drndi\u0107 quotes Jorge Luis Borges: \u201cA single moment suffices to unlock the secrets of life, and the key to all secrets is History and only History, that eternal repetition and the beautiful name of horror.\u201d The central question of Trieste is the impossibility of coming to terms with the horrors of history, when historical cycles blend past, present, and future and there is no clear way to avoid repeating yesterday\u2019s bloodshed. The novel itself is not built on character development or plot twists. Instead, Drndi\u0107 amasses archival evidence that damns not only the Nazi regime but all bystanders for their complicity in the Holocaust. The novel bears witness, and demands its readers do the same.Jan Morris describes the city of Trieste as \u201can allegory of limbo,\u201d demonstrated by its shifting political allegiances\u2014first as a part of the Habsburg empire, then later given to Italy, briefly ruled by the Germans during World War Two, and finally given back to Italy in 1954 against the wishes of Yugoslavia. In 1943, when the Germans took over Trieste, they established a police barracks and extermination camp in the former rice mill of San Sabba. Drndi\u0107\u2019s documentary evidence of the horrors experienced there shines a light on an often-overlooked part of the Holocaust. And the ability of local families such as the Tedeschis to blend into the majority during periods of crisis presents questions of culpability and identity. What does it mean to be Jewish? How to cope with the human toll of a commitment to national identity? Are children guilty of the sins of their parents? Are any families free from the ghosts of ancestors\u2019 mistakes?Throughout Trieste, Drndi\u0107 provides a wealth of historical evidence: trial transcripts, interviews, photographs, music, maps, genealogical charts. This documentary evidence is presented in overwhelming detail. In one 44-page span, Drndi\u0107 provides a list \u201cof about 9,000 Jews who were deported from Italy, or killed in Italy or in the countries Italy occupied between 1943 and 1945.\u201d Drndi\u0107\u2019s approach recalls Roberto Bola\u00f1o\u2019s list of murdered women in Mexico in 2666, and to a lesser extent his encyclopedia of fictional literary fascists, Nazi Literature in the Americas. Drndi\u0107\u2019s approach is different in part because of the years of archival research behind the novel, in part because of the sheer variety of documents she presents. In some cases, she even brings the dead back to life, as when she presents testimony from those who died in the concentration camps. And in the rooms of archives like Bad Arolsen lie millions of stories waiting to be told:At the baroque palace in Bad Arolsen, on huge sliding shelves marked with the names of the camps, cities, battles, regions, in alphabetical registers, lurk unfinished stories, trapped fates, big and little personal histories, embodied histories, there are people huddled there who languish, ghost-like, and wait for the great Mass of Liberation, the eucharistic celebration after which they will finally lie down, fall asleep or depart, soaring heavenward. Bad Arolsen, this vast collection of documented horror,preserves the patches, the fragments, the detritus of seventeen, yes, in digits, 17 million lives on 47 million pieces of paper collected from twenty-two concentration camps and their satellite organizations\u2026.Drndi\u0107 also provides a window into Haya Tedeschi\u2019s thoughts through morbidly lyrical passages detailing Haya\u2019s dreams and internal visions. Throughout the novel, during her decades of waiting, Haya is haunted by ghosts.She hears voices where there are none. Her voices are dead. All the same, she converses with the voices of the dead, she quibbles with them, sometimes she slumps limply into their arms and they whisper to her and guide her through landscapes she has forgotten. There are times when events boil over in her mind and then her thoughts become an avenue of statues, granite, marble, stone statues, plaster figures that do nothing but move their lips and tremble.Her memories a graveyard, Haya is surrounded by decay and rot. She dreams of corpses and skulls, of dragging her mother by her legs to hide her. She leafs through the archival records she has amassed, which she keeps in a red basket by her feet.Now, in 2006, while she waits, while she sifts through the past as if opening dry beanpods from which the beans fall like sealed, enslaved little stories composed of images flitting by in flashes, while she digs through the red basket at her feet uncovering the crusty layers in the little piles of sealed lives, out slips the envelope, so she puts it on her lap and rocks it as if it is a stillborn child.In 2006, as Haya walks the streets of Gorizia, the dead are more real to her than the neighbors she passes:She cannot see, nor is she watching. She has wax plugs in her ears. She does not hear\u2026. She has little memories, darting memories, fragmented. She sways on the threads of the past. On the threads of history. She swings on a spider\u2019s web.Haya used to look to literature for answers to her pain and guilt, and the novel is filled with quotations from T. S. Eliot and Romain Rolland, Jean Giono and Ezra Pound. She even engages in a debate with Kierkegaard over despair and memory. But by the end of her period of waiting, she has grown weary of words, preferring numbers and formulas instead, \u201cbecause everything is in formulas, everything.\u201dHaya\u2019s lover Kurt Franz lived the instability of language. An amateur photographer, he meets Haya in a tobacco shop, when he buys film. They soon begin to meet in secret, screening away the reality of war. Franz presents himself as cultured, handsome, charming, an avid gardener who loves his dog Barry, lives for music, and is a devoted son. In reality, before arriving at Trieste, Franz oversaw final operations at Treblinka, pushing through final executions and killing inmates by his own hand, or by ordering Barry to attack male inmates. And then, in 1943, he was assigned to Trieste, where he was responsible for overseeing the executions of Jews and partisans in San Sabba. Haya and Franz\u2019s relationship illustrates the destructive power of relationships: \u201cThe way lives interweave yet never touch, only to collide in mutual destruction, inconceivably distant in their simultaneity.\u201dHaya is not the only character haunted by Kurt Franz\u2019s crimes. Their son, Antonio Tedeschi, was kidnapped under the Lebensborn project, a German program designed by Himmler to ensure the racial purity of the German race by providing care for pregnant women, and later by enabling German families to adopt children who met the racial and biological standards set by the Nazis. Many of these children were kidnapped. Antonio provides his own testimony in the final chapters of Trieste, the only chapters written in the first person, adding to the immediacy and power of his witnessing. He speaks of his anguish in learning that the Traubes, who raised him as Hans Traube, were not his biological parents, as well as his pain and guilt in learning that his biological father was a Nazi. He holds himself complicit in his father\u2019s actions by virtue of having Franz\u2019s blood running through his veins.In a telling detail, Hans is a professional photographer, which both represents his bearing witness, and provides a link with his biological father, the amateur photographer.My situation is complicated many times over. I was stolen. I am a Lebensborn child\u2026. But theninto my life crept that murderer, S.S.-Untersturmf\u00fchrer Kurt Franz and that Jewish woman who spread her legs for him, for the blonde angel of death, the admirer of music and nature, the bad amateur fanatic photographer, the baby-faced executioner, she spread her legs while trains rumbled past, right there in front of her nose, on their way to killing grounds all over the Reich.Antonio notes that his story is shared by many others, as he provides testimony from other Lebensborn children. Their experiences reveal the continuation of hatred, secrecy, racism, and pain decades beyond the end of World War II. There\u2019s no outlet for their pain, no compensation that can give them back, not only their childhood, but also their sense of self.Antonio\u2019s voice is clear, strong, anguished. Like Haya, he attempts to reconstruct his identity through archival research. Crucially, they are both looking for some respite from the burden of history \u2013 but Drndi\u0107 does not provide much hope. As Antonio says near the conclusion of the novel, \u201cTogether, we will drape ourselves in the histories of others, believing that those pasts are our pasts and we shall sit and we shall wait for those pasts to fall into our lap like a fat, dead cat.\u201d And he concludes with a chilling reflection on the repetition of history:We should probably be able to learn something from the repetition of history, repetitio est mater studiorum, but despite the fact that history stubbornly repeats itself, we are bad learners, and History, brazen and stubborn, does not desist, it goes right on repeating and repeating itself, I will repeat myself until I faint, it says, I will repeat myself to spite you, it says, until finally you come to your senses, it says, yet we do not come to our senses, we just grow our hair, hide and lie and feign innocence. Besides, for some of us, those of us who like Santa Claus lug sacks on our backs, sacks brimming with the sins of our ancestors, History has no need to return, History is in our marrow, and here, in our bones, it drills rheumatically and no medicine can cure that. History is in our blood and in our blood it flows quietly and destructively, while on the outside there\u2019s nothing, on the outside all is calm and ordinary, until one day, History, our History, the History in our blood, in our bones, goes mad and starts eroding the miserable, crumbling ramparts of our immunity, which we have been cautiously raising for decades."}, {"userName": "Dov Zeller", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/440651-dov-zeller", "userReview": "I've read reviews in which people call this book a brilliant novel, and in my mind brilliance is beside the point and whether or not this is a novel I could not say. It is a powerful weaving together of prose, poetry, oral histories and other historical documentation. A book in which a character tries to come to terms with her choices during a time of war, and for all of her years lived after the war, forces herself to look unflinchingly at her complicity and tries to unravel the mystery of her son's disappearance (a good 60 years before this novel's chronological present.)I've heard \"Trieste\" described as \"documentary fiction\", a category I didn't know existed, and one I like very much. People compare her to Sebald, and I don't know if I agree. Her writing is much messier and much harder to assimilate, there is none of Sebald's smoothness. Instead of walking and talking like a tour-guide, it is almost as if someone is talking in the way of the ancient mariner, but without any care as to who is listening. Haya doesn't seem to notice us, she is quiet and determined and perhaps a little monomaniacal (I realize that is a conflict of terms). Meanwhile, Drndic is screaming. I can feel her voice going hoarse, her mania, her horror and frustration as she uncovers more and more evidence of the horrors of history that go on unwitnessed, un-addressed, unjustified, still clawing into our collective consciousness. If only there could be some kind of reparation, so we can move onto a clean page. But there are no clean pages. Every page has the names of the dead, of the dead and forgotten who were killed unjustly and who suffered horrifically, and the dead and forgotten whose magnificent crimes were ignored. What is more horrific? That the victims are forgotten? That perpetrators, sadistic, more than willing engineers of vast killing machines, got a pat on the back and walked away to lead \"normal\" lives? One goodreads reviewer said she wished Drndic had taken another year to assimilate her raw materials before putting it all into this novelistic form, but it is the failure of the novel to assimilate its own contents that, I think, makes it such a force of nature. It is the unresolvable tension between Haya's quiet plodding voice and Drndic's rageful despair that makes this book a thorn in an ocean-sized paw. In a way this book is a critique of assimilation and the novelistic form. People want well-crafted stories that have good table manners and even do most of the chewing and swallowing for them. Drndic kind of gives us all a big, beautiful fuck you, and says, look at this mess! This is what history is! It's an overgrown, underchewed, gristly, grizzly mess! But it doesn't have to be! Or maybe it does. Because we are pitiful, spiteful and frail. We either walk away from our genealogy and our mistakes, or we're destroyed by them. I uniquely experience in this book the weight of and continuity between the two world wars, how they are part of the same inexorable tectonic shifting of history, and all of this through the life of a little port town and its own shifting national identities, and in particular, through the days of Haya Tedeschi, an Italian born Jew whose family is caught up in all the currents of these wars and doing its best to survive, often by keeping their world-view small and focused on not rattling any windows. In fact the family converts to christianity (I can't recall if it is a full conversion) and sides with the fascists because it is the path of least resistance (literally) and it is at this time, during the second world war, when the family is doing its best to stay under the radar and going so far as to resent the resistance fighters and see them as trouble-makers and the nazis and fascists as the civilizing force, that Haya meets a charming, boyish nazi officer and has an affair with him. She is around twenty years old and relatively innocent of critical thought, just letting herself be swept in the directions that bring her the most ease of pleasure and the least risk of pain. Something like that. And then she gets pregnant and her nazi reveals his true colors in an understated and chilling moment. He leaves Trieste and leaves Haya to manage on her own with the child, and she is happy to do that. But when her child disappears the course of her life changes. She spends much of the rest of her life trying to find him, and forcing herself to look at the horrors of the war and particularly those perpetrated by her sons father. At the center of this work is the tragedy and crisis of the children, particularly Jewish children, kidnapped or held \"hostage\" by the church (i.e. never returned to their family of origin after the war) so they could be raised as proper christians (the mechanics of this continue long after the war) and of the lebensborn -- children conceived as part of the nazi project of spreading their genetics far and wide. Many of the former never discovered their true identities, or by the time they did, it too late for reparation. Many of the latter were horribly abused after the end of the war, and even those who weren't often suffered (and still suffer) greatly trying to make existential sense of being born of murderers. One of the more famous lebensborn, acknowledged in this novel, is Anni-Frid of Abba. Also central to the novel is the history of the internment camp/death camp in Trieste called San Sabba. Toward the end of the novel we move away from Haya and toward her son, a professional photographer (his father was an amateur one, and, as Antonio Tedeschi/Hans Traube tells us, untalented). While I am often distracted and disappointed by shifts in perspective, this shift deepens my experience of the story -- it is very meaningful given the address of trauma through generations. Though their life experiences quite different. their emotional struggles are hauntingly similar:\"When I write about the role of my mother in the universal history of infamy, I will not know who strolled around the San Sabba rice mill, who snapped pictures of San Sabba, my mother or I, who searched through the files of the officials of the Adriatisches Kustenland, she or I, who studied the detailed form the life of SS Untersturmfuhrer Kurt Franz, Haya Tedeschi or I, Hans Traube-Antonio Tedeschi, who was it that visited Treblinka. Together, we will drape ourselves in the histories of others, believing that those pasts are our pasts and we shall sit and we shall wait for those pasts to fall into our lap like a fat, dead cat.\" (351)Some quotes from the novel (I could post many more, but not sure where to begin or end)Her grandfather was born in Gorz. Her mother was born in Gorz. She was born in Gorizia/Gorica. When the Great War broke out, the began moving, living in many places. She doesn\u2019t know what Gorz was, nor does she know what Gorizia is now though she has been here nearly sixty years. She take walks along Gorizia\u2019s streets, but hers are brief forays, quick walks, walks with a purpose, jaunts. Even when she takes longer strolls, when her strolls are more leisurely (when the days are mild and her room feels stale, a humid inertia), Haya doesn\u2019t notice the big changes in her surroundings. She feels as if she has been sitting for sixty years in a shrinking room, a room whose walls are moving slowly inward to meet at a miniature surface, a line, at the apex of which she sits, crushed. She cannot see, nor is she watching. She has wax plugs in her ears. She does not hear. Gore, Gorizia, are memories. She isn\u2019t certain whose memories they are. Hers or her family\u2019s. Maybe they are fresh memories. When she goes out she squints at the sun, picks daisies, sits at the Joy Cafe and smokes. She has not let herself go. She does not wear black. She is not forever rocking back and forth. All is as it should be. She has a television. She has little memories, darting memories, fragmented. She sways on the threads of the past. On the threads of history. She swing son a spider\u2019s web. She is very light. Around her, in her, now is quiet. Giros has a history, she has a history. The days are so old. (8)MINCULPOP is born, the Ministry of Popular Culture, and with it new dictionaries, orthographies, patriotism; the use of foreign phrases Is banned, and they are replaced by Italian surrogates. Maxim Gorky is dubbed Massimo Amaro, but he is swiftly removed from the libraries and bookshops; Louis Armstrong becomes Luigi Fortebraccio, and Benny Goodman is Benjamin Buonuomo; shortly thereafter MINCULPOP bans all jazz performance and broadcasts. Life in the Tedeschi family goes on. For Haya it is altogether ordinary, completely forgettable, as ordinary life is, until the day when, at the beginning of the school year in September 1938, her teachers Nella Negri, Amato di Veroli, Samuel Tagliacozzo, Massimo Pavoncello and Viola Sass do not show up to teach Geography, Mathematics, History, Italian and Physical Education. Until the day when Florian, after dinner, whispering in a conspiratorial hush, as if about to say something obscene, declares, We are Jews, and [Haya] asks, What does that mean? (47)On San Sabba So in 1976 Haya makes a little file, utterly pointless. She writes out notes, arranges them, rearranges them, as if shuffling a pack of cards. I could play solitaire with these notes, she says, which, in a sense, she does. This dog-eared file, full of cracked photographs of people, most of whom no longer exist, becomes Haya\u2019s obsession; over the year she supplements her collection, slips into it little oddities, terse news items which after two, three, four decades she digs out and peruses, as if grabbing at dry dandelion fluff, as if catching eiderdown in a warm wind. Pointless, pointless. Forgotten dossiers, sealed archives open slowly, slowly, and what emerges is no more than water dripping from cracked sewage pipes. During the Trieste trial in 1976 only the two \u2018big fish\u2019 remain: Josef Oberhauser, brewer in Munich, former San Sabba commander and - from 1941 to the end of the war - Dr. Dietrich Allers, a high ranking official, one of the executive directors of the T4 program, a lawyer and SS -Obersturmbannfuhrer (approximately a colonel). But Allers dies a year before the trial, in 1975. Born in 1910 in Hamburg, Allers worked as an attorney until 1968, when he is sentenced to eight years in prison, which he does not serve out. So all the fuss, all the pursuit of justice - for nothing, because according to the agreements in force at the time between Italy and Germany, only those suspected of crimes committed after 1948 may be extradited. The trial goes on literally in a void: no defendants sit in the courtroom, the judges natter on, journalists snap their cameras - at no-one. In a solemn voice the judgement is read out to unschooled farmer Josef Oberhausen, but Josef Oberhausen is nowhere to be seen, so to whom is the judgement read? Oberhausen is sentenced in Trieste to life imprisonment, yet in Munich he goes on selling beer, especially during the Oktoberfest, when he is in particularly fine fettle. Three years later, in 1079, fat Oberhausen dies of a heart attack. ~On Barry, the dog of nazi Kurt Franz I don\u2019t know how he was with children, but he was docile. After Treblinka closed, Barry was taken in by a Nazi physician and in 1944 the doctor sent Barry to his wife in northern Germany. Several years later they put Barry down, because he was old and feeble. Later, in 1965, veterinarians and psychologists from Dusseldorf asked the famous behavioral scientist Konrad Lorenz to shed some light on the dog\u2019s behavior. Lorenz told them that such behavior in a dog is altogether plausible; that a dog\u2019s behavior expresses the subconscious of the dog\u2019s master, as Lorenz put it. If he has an aggressive master, the dog will probably attack other people, Lorenz said, and if the behavior of his master changes, the dog\u2019s behavior will change as well, Lorenz said, and Lorenz can be believed, because during the war he was a loyal Nazi who \u2018changed masters\u2019 after the war and was given the Nobel Prize in 1973 for his research into animal and human behavior. (278)On the church\u2019s role in child kidnapping during and after the war. It is known, writes Morelli, that at the time of the war many children found shelter in Catholic monasteries, in boarding schools and in schools, but not at the behest of the Pope, writes Morelli. It is well known that after the war the Jews who survived had serious difficulties locating their children, retrieving their children from Catholic institutions, writes Morelli, but until now it was only possible to surmise that the Church was systematically stealing Jewish children in order to indulge Jesus. For sixty years the Church and its \u2018servants\u2019 have been striving to prove to the world that they have no blemish on their conscience for their activities as far as World War Two is concerned, writes Morelli. For sixty years the Church has been trying to prove the innocence of Pope Pius XII and many of his bishops and priests. If there is anything that has been preserved with dedication and faith, anything that has been sacrosanct in the church books, then it is the dates of baptisms and deaths, writes Morelli, so it wouldn\u2019t be difficult to ascertain what happened to the baptized Jewish children. If Switzerland, so-called neutral Switzerland, has mustered the strength to set up the edgier Commission, the I.C.E. - An independent commission of experts - though only on 12 December, 1996, writes Alfonso Morelli, to prove the ties between the Nazi regime and the Swiss banks who had at their disposal vast quantities of stolen Jewish property: if Australia has spoken out about the children kidnapped by their authorities, stolen from Aborigines during World War One, writes Morelli, then instead of obscuring history, the Catholic Church can get off its are and throw open its archives. And not only that, writes Morelli. It is time for the Church to stop pretending, to stop lying about how its greatest crime during the war was inadequate involvement in saving Jews, writes Morelli, it is time for the Church to stop believing that it is enough for it to launch anaemic apologies for its \u2018inadvertent\u2019 lapses, these ecclesiastical apologies, which are becoming more and more revolting over time, truly disgusting, insipid, writes Alfonso Morelli, because, he writes, it is reasonable to deduce that this letter written to Cardinal Roncalli is not the only incriminating document hidden in the vast secret archives of the Catholic Church. We are hopeful it has become clear by now, writes Morelli, that the Church should slow things down a bit as far as the panicked, nearly hysterical race to beautify, canonize, whatever, Pius XII, who, ah, now this is something that is widely known, writes Morelli, was at the head of a Church which was openly championing anti-Semitism at a time when the Nazis and Fascists were persecuting and murdering Jews on a grand scale. He, Pius XII, led a Church in which many German priests abused church birth registers in order to help the Nazis determine who should be first to wear a yellow star - and then be killed, and some German priests kept right on doing this officially for an entire decade after the Holocaust ended, in order to convince those Jews once and for all that they were guilty of murdering Christ. Just as a reminder, writes Morelli, the \u2018Reichskonkodat\u2019, a concordat signed on 20 July, 1933, between the Holy See and the Reich, is in force in Germany to this day. During that time, Eugenio Cardinal Pacelli, the future Pope Pius XII, is Secretary of the Vatican, and he is the one who signs this concordat, while Cardinal Micheal von Faulhaber, writes Morelli, in a sermon given in Munich in 1937, says, \u2018Now, when the leaders of the greatest world nations observe the rise of the new Germany with a dose of reservation and much skepticism, the Catholic Church, this greatest moral force on earth, is showing its trust in the new German authorities through this concordat, which is an act of vast significance, because it contributes to the strengthening of the renown of the new authorities throughout the world,\u2019 says Faulhaber, writes Morelli. Abe Foxman tells me, continues Morelli, and Foxman is director of the Anti-Defamation League, writes Morelli, that they placed him, Foxman, with a Polish family and his nanny had him secretly baptized, and later there were terrible problems, all sorts of complications, before he was returned to his parents. I believe that today there are tens of thousands of Jewish children in the world who were saved and then baptized, Abraham Foxman tells me, writes Alfonso Morelli, children who do not know to this day of their origins, nor will they ever learn of them, says Foxman, writes Morelli.

Nada raro por otra parte, cuando la materia narrativa tiene que ver con las abominables acciones perpetradas por los nazis durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial contra los jud\u00edos, gitanos, partisanos, discapacitados, etc.Si uno desea conocer de primera mano lo que es la maldad humana en estado puro, aqu\u00ed encontrar\u00e1 unos cuantos testimonios capaz de llevarte al borde de la n\u00e1usea, sin apenas esfuerzo. Cuando al ser humano lo despojan de tal condici\u00f3n, se convierte en un objeto, en una materia sin valor, en una \u201ccarga\u201d que se manipula como cualquier otro producto, una carga que ser\u00e1 procesada, y reducida a cenizas y que luego en sacos ser\u00e1 arrojada al fondo del mar o enterrada, a fin de no dejar los nazis rastro de sus atrocidades.Cuando la guerra acaba y los miembros de las SS y del tercer Reich son juzgados, ninguno de ellos reconoce sus cr\u00edmenes, ni la maldad impl\u00edcita en los mismos. M\u00e1s all\u00e1 de la obediencia debida, de alegar que estaban librando una guerra, que cumpl\u00edan con su deber, ninguno de ellos se cuestiona, si degradar a seres humanos, darles tiros en la nuca al pie de las fosas comunes, matar a los prisioneros a golpes o dispararles como si fuesen conejos, mientras corren aterrorizados o vejarlos hasta reducirlos a un amasijo de carne arrumbada, lanzar beb\u00e9s al aire y tirotearlos como si fuese una modalidad del tiro al plato, y finalmente gasearlos y matarlos haci\u00e9ndoles creer que les van a dar una ducha reparadora, nada de todo esto es cuestionado por estos soldados, nada es puesto en entredicho, nada es simiente de remordimiento alguno, era el sistema dec\u00edan, as\u00ed eran las cosas se defend\u00edan.Una vez finaliza el exterminio quienes no son llevados ante la justicia, vuelven a sus hogares, a sus roles de padres ejemplares, de maridos perfectos, mientras escuchan m\u00fasica cl\u00e1sica en sus gram\u00f3fonos y podan sus rosales, y leen la prensa y llevan vidas tranquilas en sus oficios, residiendo en las ciudades que les vieron crecer, hasta que un buen d\u00eda alguien -esos pocos que lograron sobrevivir a los campos de exterminio- los reconocen por las calles, y entonces son llevados hasta la justicia, y unos son condenados a cadena perpetua, y muchos otros son liberados a los pocos a\u00f1os por causas humanitarias, declarados enfermos y muchos ni siquiera van a la c\u00e1rcel, pues se han borrado tantas huellas como se han podido y los jueces imponen sentencias irrisorias, donde la muerte de varios miles de personas se salda con unos pocos a\u00f1os de c\u00e1rcel en el peor de los casos.Y la reflexi\u00f3n que uno se hace es que la violencia siempre genera violencia y da\u00f1o y malestar y no trae nunca nada bueno, y el que sobrevive y no se ciega con la venganza, a duras penas consigue sobrellevar el pasado, la tristeza, la amargura y muchas son las v\u00edctimas que tras dejar los campos deciden suicidarse.A su vez, los hijos bastardos que tuvieron los nazis, o aquellos fruto de las violaciones perpetradas en los territorios ocupados por los nazis, o los que fueron a parar a los Lebensborn de Himmler (que tras la guerra ser\u00edan desmantelados) dejaron en el camino a miles de ni\u00f1os, m\u00e1s tarde adultos que nunca supieron quienes fueron sus padres, sus madres, su familiares. Ni\u00f1os que en esos orfanatos fueron v\u00edctimas de abusos de todo tipo, de maltratos, de m\u00faltiples vejaciones, pues sus agresores: bedeles, vigilantes, directores, ve\u00edan en ellos la simiente del diablo, cuando hablamos de ni\u00f1os de muy corta edad. Otra barbarie m\u00e1s.En 1935 el t\u00edtulo de beb\u00e9 ario m\u00e1s bello de Berl\u00edn lo obtuvo una ni\u00f1a de seis meses llamada Hessy Levinsons \u00bfSe imaginan lo que sigue?. S\u00ed, los padres de la ni\u00f1a, eran cantantes de \u00f3pera, originarios de Lituania y jud\u00edos. La fotograf\u00eda de la ni\u00f1a se utiliz\u00f3 para la edici\u00f3n de tarjetas postales de manera que Hessy recorri\u00f3 todos los territorios de Alemania impresa en una postal de felicitaci\u00f3n. Ni\u00f1os y ni\u00f1as jud\u00edas que bajo las leyes de pureza aria, pocos a\u00f1os m\u00e1s tarde ser\u00edan exterminados.Niklas Frank, hijo de un criminal nazi, abomin\u00f3 de su padre, de su pasado, de todas las cosas horrendas que este hizo. Es de los pocos que lo ha hecho. Frank piensa que lo que habr\u00eda que haber hecho es haber ejecutado a todos los nazis, sin juicio ninguno. Porque si no nos encontramos con lo que luego ha pasado, que todo aquello ha germinado, que los nazis supervivientes, fueron luego arropados, justificados, minimizando entre todos ellos y a la larga, todo aquello, porque \u201cEl silencio se ha convertido en una enorme losa de cemento armado\u201d.\u201cDe la Alemania nazi naci\u00f3 una red de canales subterr\u00e1neos y que ahora llaman el duelo, la tristeza y el olvido, y que son como los tres r\u00edos m\u00edticos que nunca se secan: Aqueronte, Cocito y Lete\u201d.Thomas Bernhard cree que al Partido nacionalsocialista le sucedi\u00f3 el Partido cat\u00f3lico, y que \u201cambas son dos enfermedades contagiosas, enfermedades del esp\u00edritu\u201d.

Pens\u00e1bamos que nosotros ya les hab\u00edamos ayudado y que si ellos continuaban ululando en la noche era su problema, es lo que pens\u00e1bamos. Les hab\u00edamos dado mantas y caf\u00e9 y sopa. Y si ellos continuaban rebel\u00e1ndose, no nos parec\u00eda correcto. Pens\u00e1bamos: esta gente monta tanto alboroto que no nos dejan dormir. Eso es lo que nuestros vecinos escrib\u00edan en los diarios.En estos tiempos tan l\u00edquidos y desmemoriados, esta monumental novela de Da\u0161a Drndi\u0107 con una trabajada traducci\u00f3n de Simona \u0160krabec, muy bien editada por Autom\u00e1tica Editorial (la bella portada es obra de Natalia Zaratiegui - http://nataliazaratiegui.com/portfoli...), es m\u00e1s necesaria que nunca, para que nadie olvide lo que sucedi\u00f3 en Europa hace apenas 70 a\u00f1os, ahora que las carreteras y los trenes de media Europa se pueblan de refugiados y los mares se llenan cada d\u00eda de cad\u00e1veres de ni\u00f1os y adultos, y el horizonte se cubre de verjas, muros y concertinas, es momento de no olvidar que nuestra pasividad, nuestra inoperancia, el dejar abandonados a su suerte a miles de personas, es abocarlos a una muerte segura.

Much of that time seems to have been spent online, downloading documents from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum's collection and other Holocaust related sites. Witness testimonies, lists of Jews deported from Italy or killed in the countries occupied by Italy (43 pages of names!), photocopied photographs inserted, W. G. Sebald-style, into the text, transcripts from the Nuremberg Trials, capsule bios of prominent Nazis.Collecting all this stuff took time, but the hard work of extracting meaning from it is left to the reader. Maybe Drndi\u0107 was overwhelmed by the task she set for herself, but I'd have liked it if she'd spent another year at the very least reflecting on her material, distilling it (as Sebald does). I see this as the responsibility of an author who takes on a topic like the Shoah, to help readers navigate those dangerous shoals. The line between Holocaust literature and Holocaust porn is easily crossed.What's the difference? I'm going to let Imre Kertez, the author of Fatelessness (which I reviewed here a few weeks ago) answer that one: I am somebody who survived all of it, somebody who saw the Gorgon\u2019s head and still retained enough strength to finish a work that reaches out to people in a language that is humane. The purpose of literature is for people to become educated, to be entertained, so we can\u2019t ask them to deal with such gruesome visions. I created a work representing the Holocaust as such, but without this being an ugly literature of horrors.Perhaps I\u2019m being impertinent, but I feel that my work has a rare quality\u2014I tried to depict the human face of this history, I wanted to write a book that people would actually want to read."}, {"userName": "Roger Brunyate", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42294189-roger-brunyate", "userReview": "Behind Every Name There is a StoryAbeasis ClementeAbeasis EsterAbeasis GiorgioAbeasis Rebecca[\u2026]Zundler Henriette CeciliaZwirblawsky Enoc HerschZylber SzayaZynger Jerachmil.These are the first and last of a list of around 9,000 Jews from Italy or Italian-occupied countries killed between 1943 and 1945. Forty-four pages printed in four columns of small type, they stand like a granite wall separating the first half of this book from the second. Although visually the most unusual feature in this totally extraordinary Holocaust novel, it is not the only one: there are court transcripts, poems, entries from a biographical dictionary, fragments in many languages, and even grainy photographs in the manner of W. G. Sebald. And names, names, names.The protagonist, though based on fact, is fictional. Haya Tesdeschi, an old woman of 83, sits in her room in Gorizia, on the border between Italy, Austria, and Croatia, and waits to meet her son, stolen from her by the Germans as a baby, 62 years before, in 1944. But the photos in the basket at her feet go back even farther, to when her parents had not yet met and Gorizia was an international spa. As she does throughout the book, Drndic paints the picture in Homeric fashion, by conjuring up names:Ah, all the actresses, duchesses, dancers; all the poets, journalists, singers and marquises whom He gets to know and love long after his first forays to local brothels at sixteen (when He pawned His grandfather's watch); ah, Teodolinde and Clemenze, and Giselda Zucconi, and Olga Ossani; Maria Luisa Casati Stampa, amasser of exotic animals and bizarre furniture; oh, Ida Rubinstein, Isadora Duncan, the singer Olga Levi Brunner, and after her, the pianist Luisa Baccara, then the wealthy American painter Romaine Goddard Brooks, who later comes out as a lesbian; then, oh Lord, celebrated Eleanora Duse\u2026It goes on, the list of names, famous and forgotten, beginning as an unstoppable lyrical stream, but changing eventually to a meticulous accounting of atrocity. Haya is born, grows up, meets a charming young German soldier nicknamed \"The Doll,\" bears his child. Meanwhile trains pass through Gorizia, trains whose schedules are notated in numbing detail. A nearby rice factory is converted as a detention center. The parade of names continues, but now they are the biographical entries of personnel from Sobibor or Treblinka, excerpts from their trials, and a note of what happened to them after the war (in most cases, nothing).Haya becomes a mathematics teacher, retires, and waits. She still amasses information, but the witnesses in the trials she now sees in her mind are mostly ghosts. The poets Elliot and Pound have more to say to her than the voices of living people. But her story is still about names. Somewhere in Germany, in the small town of Bad Arolsen to be precise, there are millions of them, archived documents that might reunite her with her son. And so the focus passes to the next generation, people who wake up one day to discover that they are the children of mass murderers.With the one exception of its central character, this is a book of facts. But facts marshaled with such variety of technique, such ingenuity, such anger, and such compassion that the book makes compelling reading from its beautiful start to an ending that, with so much purged away, has its own very different kind of beauty.

The book also includes snippets of music, and poetry and prose from writers as diverse as Ernest Hemingway, Jorges Luis Borges, Ezra Pound, T.S.

If it IS called Goizia today and hasn't changed its name again.Absolutely the most depressing read of either 2013 or 2014 for me, and I have read some dire ones. I could only take about 30 pages at a time-just reading it made me too nervous. And I just skimmed the last 100 pages. How many ways can you express the chaos and misery within one place? This one would win any contest in that category, hands down.The 3 stars are given for the research and testimony. Not for any reading enjoyment. I don't recommend this book to anyone who isn't reading it toward a degree study or for some special purpose (like a book group). It entraps hopelessness and despair. Or perhaps you like to feel the suffering? Not I, and this is a prime reason why I normally do not gather with the group book readers, as this one was."}, {"userName": "kathleen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5006220-kathleen", "userReview": "An impressive work of \"documentary fiction,\" a term I hadn't heard before but which describes the genre of \"Trieste\" perfectly. I've read little of the reality of WWII in Italy, and in the region of Trieste, where it was particularly fraught. The only concentration camp in Italy exists outside of the city. It's multi-ethnicity made it of particular interest to the Nazis, who along with Jews targeted its Slavs and leftists. The story is based on historical events and records, and taking the documentary affect to the fullest, on a real family. Besides its story, its multiplicity of stories in fact, is Drndic's unusual style of telling. It is as if you are listening to a grandmother achingly and with extreme difficulty facing up to what she experienced through storytelling, punctuated with bursts of rage and weeping and references to deeply researched evidence just in case you might not believe her. After all, there is no logic to a story about how the Nazis and their collaborators behaved.Drndic explores the aftermath of the war, in the memories that linger unwanted but inescapably."}, {"userName": "Diana", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7266867-diana", "userReview": "An impactful book, but not an easy read.

El libro de los nombresLa literatura del Holocausto siempre ha sido una literatura interior, una literatura de supervivencia. Incluso es dudoso poder utilizar el t\u00e9rmino literatura para unos escritos que se agarran a la experiencia desesperadamente, a una experiencia tan terrible que rechaza envoltorios y se quiere despojada. Esto nos ha llevado a menudo a quedarnos en un solo punto, suspendido, terrible: la experiencia de los campos, la experiencia del dolor y la muerte. Y nos ha dejado hu\u00e9rfanos del antes y el despu\u00e9s, m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de unas coordenadas hist\u00f3ricas y de unas secuelas que no tendr\u00e1n final porque no pueden tener final. Cuando entrevistamos a Varujan Vosganian sobre El libro de los susurros, nos comentaba\u2026Lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil en el mundo es dar nombre a los sufrimientos. La diferencia entre Historia, literatura y cultura es que, en la Historia, el sufrimiento es abstracto. En los libros de Historia los muertos se escriben con muchos ceros. En literatura, el muerto no tiene ceros. Cada muerto tiene su cruz. Cada muerto tiene su nombre. Es muy dif\u00edcil nombre dar nombre a los datos.Y ahora, al leer Trieste, de Da\u0161a Drndi\u0107, esas palabras han vuelto. Porque Trieste, despu\u00e9s de todo, es el intento de dar nombre a las personas. A los que estuvieron pero no vieron nada, a los que murieron y a los que les asesinaron. Es intentar recomponer el tiempo que se rompi\u00f3, la Historia que se quebr\u00f3. Es juntar los fragmentos rotos, los brazos, piernas, cabezas, cuerpos descompuestos de tantas personas, para intentar devolver una imagen justa. Una imagen justa que es desoladora. Restaurar los colores de una imagen que busca ser olvidada, que fue olvidada.Haya Tedeschi es el primer nombre. El nombre del que deben de brotar todos los dem\u00e1s. La primera pieza alrededor de la que construir un puzle en el que faltan millones de piezas. Perdidas, enterradas. Haya Tedeschi ha vivido en Trieste. Primero el fascismo y luego, con este desbordado, el nazismo. Aunque jud\u00eda, su familia abraz\u00f3 la causa del fascismo, se hicieron carnets, miraron para otro lado y ella incluso se entreg\u00f3 voluntariamente a un alem\u00e1n, con el que tuvo un hijo. El hijo desapareci\u00f3. El alem\u00e1n no era cualquier alem\u00e1n. En los alrededores de Trieste estaba San Sabba. Una arrocera. Una arrocera que se utiliz\u00f3 como campo de exterminio. Pero nadie sab\u00eda nada. Algunos de los m\u00e1s terribles responsables de los campos de exterminio alemanes pasaron por all\u00ed. Pero nadie quiso saber nada. En su horno crematorio murieron cerca de cinco mil personas, pero nadie las conoc\u00eda.Haya espera. Espera a su hijo. El desaparecido. Han pasado muchos a\u00f1os y recuerda. Recuerda la historia de su familia y su propia historia. Y a partir de ah\u00ed Da\u0161a Drndi\u0107 estira y estira. Incansablemente va poniendo juntas palabras y fotograf\u00edas. Nombres. El libro se parte en dos. En su centro, la lista de los nueve mil jud\u00edos asesinados en Italia. Citados uno a uno, como un coraz\u00f3n que hace latir lo anterior y lo posterior.

Una certeza nada amable con el ser humano. Una sensaci\u00f3n de que nunca supimos nada porque nunca quisimos saber nada. Y que cuando supimos algo, solo quisimos olvidarlo.

Much of the book covers familiar territory, as the era is well-documented in both fiction and non-fiction. But Drndic brings a new dimension to the events by setting her story in Italy and bringing to our attention some of the lesser-known aspects of the time , such as, for example, a description of the Risiera of San Sabba, the only concentration camp on Italian soil, today a little-known and little-visited memorial, and the fact that freight-trains carrying Italian Jews and anti-fascists were allowed to travel through neutral Switzerland.This book is an amazing achievement, meshing together both fiction and non-fiction with almost every page presenting the reader with a new fact, a new scenario, so that the sum total is almost overwhelming. So unremitting is the tension that I couldn\u2019t put it down and read it almost in one sitting. Even if some of the material is familiar, our involvement in Haya\u2019s personal story as an individual brings home to us once again the true horror of the Hitler era.The front cover calls the book \u201ca monumental contribution to the literature of Europe\u2019s modern history\u201d and with that I most wholeheartedly concur."}, {"userName": "Ann Marie Olszewski", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10770914-ann-marie-olszewski", "userReview": "An absolutely stunning and moving book, which forces you to confront the fact that the past is rarely past, but continues to haunt the present, often as a ravaged specter. There was a scrapbook-like quality to Haya's reminisces (she's actually taking mementoes out of a basket), but it was the last few chapters - told from the point of view of her son, kidnapped in infancy and raised by German parents - that truly resonated long after I closed the book. This is one of the somewhat forgotten aspects of the Nazi era - the children who were born and raised specifically to be the Aryans of the future, in a world where the Nazis expected to dominate. When that (thankfully) didn't happen, these children were a painful reminder of the past and an easy target for vilification. These children were unwilling collaborators - they had no choice in who their parents were, yet many of them assumed the guilt that the adults living through those years were hesitant to acknowledge themselves. In them, and in their own children, the past goes on and on. This book makes it painfully clear that for many, you never quite get over the horror of having a Nazi in the family tree.The melding of fiction and fact (certain characters were, or are, actual known figures) is seamless, and the language is gorgeous without ever becoming cloying or sentimental.

One story tumbles into another, to be interrupted by another, held together by the central \"part Jewish\" family from Gorizia (north of Trieste on the Italy-Slovenia border). Haya Tedeschi's family stories float in and out, just as the town moves alternately into Italian, German, and Austrian territory over time. Author Da\u0161a Drndi\u010d manages to cram into this one book a mound of horrifying detailed accounts (from townsfolk to SS revelers, from death camp participants to Nuremberg trial witnesses). But the power is in the emotional backdrop she conveys so profoundly: a Jewish family on the move, a tormented mathematician embroiled in partisan politics, rampant maniacal hatred, dead-hearted evil, bewilderment at one's ability to look away and avoid questions or answers, outright anger at the Catholic Church, the evisceration of being denied one's religious and family identity, and the tortuous effects of rediscovering an awful, unwanted family history. \"I have arranged a multitude of lives,\" says the narrator, \"a pile of the past, into an inscrutable, incoherent series of occurrences.\" As powerful as it is to visit death camps or plow through Nazi museums and histories, this barely-fictional telling brings the fascist era to crackling reality."}, {"userName": "Jackie Molloy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7332619-jackie-molloy", "userReview": "Trieste is a City and seaport in north-eastern Italy it lies on a narrow strip of Italian territory which borders Slovenia and is very close to Croatia.

We first encounter Haya in 2006, alone with her memories and family history and the enduring hope that her son will be found one day, and the narrative goes back into the past, jumping from one time to another to create a non-linear story that uses one family\u2019s history to explore the brutal and tragic history of the twentieth century, with a particular focus on fascism and Nazism.The Tedeschi family come from an area of Central Europe which has existed as a fluid borderland, a frontier country, for centuries. Haya\u2019s grandmother is a Slovene speaker, her mother and maternal aunts and uncles use mostly German in the refugee camps in which they end up spending the First World War, and her father comes from a middle-class Italian-speaking family in the Italian peninsula. In the early part of the book, which covers the 1910s to the 1930s, Drndi\u0107 is mostly focused on borders and languages, and how the fascist movements of the 30s came to be in this region of ever-changing regimes and allegiances. Despite their multi-lingual, multi-national background and Jewish heritage, the Tedeschi family are remarkably detached from the political upheavals surrounding them, and we are mostly informed about these developments by the omniscient narrator.Once the Second World War arrives, the Tedeschi family stop bring able to ignore politics. Haya and her family flee from their home in Nazi territory and end up in Albania, where they cope with their situation in varied ways. Haya\u2019s siblings are too young to understand the danger they are in, her mother thrives on denial, and Haya herself \u2013 a teenager by this time \u2013 embarks on her first romances.

Como ciudad fronteriza y en la convulsa historia desgajada de condados y se\u00f1ores de la guerra que es la historia de Italia y de la Europa del Imperio, Trieste tiene varios nombres: en esloveno, Trst, en friuliano y en alem\u00e1n, Triest\u2026 Ha sido habitual moneda de cambio y ha formado sucesivamente parte de Italia o del Imperio Austro-h\u00fangaro. Su nombre, en castellano y en italiano, suena a melancol\u00eda, a lluvia, a frontera, a borde.Ese es el t\u00edtulo con el que Dasa Drndic nos presenta una novela desgarradora, que se va haciendo m\u00e1s desgarradora a medida que avanza el relato. La primera parte cuenta la historia de una familia jud\u00eda que vive a caballo de la frontera, que son eslovenos e italianos, que conocen el alem\u00e1n y hablan italiano, una familia acomodada que sufre con los vaivenes de la primera guerra mundial y van creciendo, haci\u00e9ndose mayores, teniendo hijos que sufren, que disfrutan, que se espabilan. Pero de repente, empiezan a verse privados de sus derechos por el simple hecho de ser jud\u00edos. Como muchos otros, deben hacerse el carnet del partido fascista de Mussolini para poder trabajar, para seguir dando clases o seguir en una empresa de representaci\u00f3n de paraguas.Y la narraci\u00f3n de la familia discurre hasta la hija, Ada Tedeschi, que tiene un hijo a ra\u00edz de su relaci\u00f3n con un oficial alem\u00e1n destinado en Trieste. Hasta aqu\u00ed la historia no deja de ser hasta cierto punto, convencional. Pero a los seis meses de maternidad y cuando la guerra parece entrar en su resoluci\u00f3n, con las derrotas de los pa\u00edses del Eje frente a los aliados, su hijo, Antonio Tedeschi, desaparece. Ada ve interrumpido su papel de madre. Ya nunca lo volver\u00e1 a ser; nunca volver\u00e1 a confiar en un hombre.En esta segunda parte, se empieza a indagar en el horror del holocausto, en lo que representa la memoria hist\u00f3rica y la importancia de mantenerla, de llamar a las cosas por su nombre. En Italia tambi\u00e9n hubo campos de concentraci\u00f3n y muy cerca de Trieste se encontraba la arrocera de San Sabba, una f\u00e1brica convertida por los oficiales de las SS en un campo de exterminio. En el libro aparecen los nombres de los cerca de 9 000 jud\u00edos asesinados en Italia mismo o deportados a otros campos de exterminio. Es un listado de nombres, a tres columnas y con tipograf\u00eda peque\u00f1a, que ocupan 70 p\u00e1ginas del libro. Desde el punto de vista editorial o comercial, esto representa una peque\u00f1a agresi\u00f3n al lector, un texto intrascendente, vacuo. Desde el punto de vista humano, representa un imperativo moral, una necesidad de homenaje a esos muertos que sufrieron el holocausto nazi.Viviendo en un pa\u00eds donde constantemente se tergiversa y se pisotea la memoria hist\u00f3rica y se banalizan los 40 a\u00f1os de dictadura atroz que vivi\u00f3 este pa\u00eds, resulta enormemente gratificante la valent\u00eda de acometer un proyecto de este tipo. La valent\u00eda de la autora, por supuesto, pero tambi\u00e9n la valent\u00eda de una editorial independiente -Autom\u00e1tica Editorial-, de poner en circulaci\u00f3n un libro que deber\u00eda de ser obligatorio en los institutos. Porque, \u00bfconocen nuestros j\u00f3venes lo que represent\u00f3 el holocausto? \u00bfSe pueden llegar a asumir las dimensiones de aquel crimen? Libros como este ayudan a ello, aunque uno no deje de mostrar estupor al recorrer sus p\u00e1ginas.El libro adem\u00e1s ejerce ese papel recordatorio tan necesario, poniendo nombre y apellidos a algunos de los c\u00f3mplices necesarios. El padre de Arnold Schwarzenegger fue un soldado raso del Tercer Reich, con lo que le quitaba importancia a su participaci\u00f3n en el holocausto. Despu\u00e9s de Vietnam, despu\u00e9s de Irak, todos sabemos lo que un soldado raso puede hacer en una guerra como aquella. El padre de Madeleine Albright, la antigua secretaria de estado de USA, particip\u00f3 de manera activa en la guerra, aunque no encontrar\u00e1n rastro de ello en Wikipedia. La connivencia del estado \u201cneutral\u201d suizo, tanto en la acumulaci\u00f3n de los r\u00e9ditos de la guerra, del expolio de las gafas, de los dientes de oro, de las pertenencias de los individuos eliminados, como en la permisividad con los propios transportes: muchos de los deportados desde Italia pasaron por Suiza, utilizaron su red de transportes, fueron custodiados y protegidos por el gobierno. O la Cruz Roja, y su firme voluntad, ejercida desde sus inicios, de no participar. Pero \u00bfes posible declararse neutral si no lo intentas evitar? \u00bfNo es esa permisividad una manera de convertirse en c\u00f3mplice?En este apartado, el libro recuerda a otros libros testimonio, como los del nobel Aleksander Solzhenitsyn sobre los gulag y las deportaciones sovi\u00e9ticas y, en algunos puntos, aunque sin el vitriolismo ir\u00f3nico de este, a La literatura nazi en Am\u00e9rica, de Roberto Bola\u00f1o, un listado de nombres con una somera biograf\u00eda. En este caso, los nombres son reales, responden a su participaci\u00f3n en los hechos y uno, como lector, no puede dejar de sentirse abrumado por las cifras. Personas responsables, directa o indirectamente, de la muerte de medio mill\u00f3n de seres humanos. Personas capaces de reventar sistem\u00e1ticamente la cabeza de ni\u00f1os que llegaban a los campos junto a sus padres. Personas que se dedicaban a cabalgar con su caballo blanco a diario y disfrutaban disparando a otras personas por el simple placer de la caza, del deporte, porque pod\u00edan. Todo un sistema complejo, estudiado, de transportes, unos esfuerzos dedicados exclusivamente al exterminio. \u00bfC\u00f3mo pudo suceder? \u00bfC\u00f3mo se sostiene todav\u00eda aquello de \u201cNo sab\u00edamos nada\u201d?El papel de la iglesia tambi\u00e9n es clarificado a lo largo de las p\u00e1ginas del libro. Primero, en el desenmascaramiento: Ratzinger es denominado con el sobrenombre de \u201cRottweiler\u201d, que se le puso durante la guerra, cosa que elimina cualquier atisbo de inocencia. Pero no solo eso; la iglesia como instituci\u00f3n particip\u00f3 activamente en el robo de ni\u00f1os como el de la historia que nos ocupa, Antonio Tedeschi, o Hans Traube, como \u00e9l cre\u00eda que se llamaba. La Iglesia Cat\u00f3lica, la instituci\u00f3n as\u00ed denominada, ayud\u00f3 al r\u00e9gimen nazi bautizando a los ni\u00f1os robados y convirti\u00e9ndolos en cat\u00f3licos. Una vez acabada la guerra, el propio Juan XXIII, conocido como el \u201cPapa bueno\u201d, instaba a las diferentes parroquias y di\u00f3cesis a no hacer p\u00fablicos los documentos en los que se registraban los bautizos, a no ayudar en las investigaciones para devolver a estos ni\u00f1os, en la medida de lo posible, a sus familias. Y ese secretismo, esa voluntad de no ceder, no es una cuesti\u00f3n del pasado. Entronca con la memoria hist\u00f3rica puesto que esa decisi\u00f3n llega hasta nuestros d\u00edas. Los que han conocido su verdadera historia no lo han hecho gracias a la difusi\u00f3n de los documentos eclesi\u00e1sticos que, Papa tras Papa, siguen empecinados en mantener una instituci\u00f3n que larva el mal en su seno, a trav\u00e9s del goteo de casos y m\u00e1s casos de pederastia, y por su complicidad con las m\u00e1s sanguinarias dictaduras, desde \u00c1frica, a Latinoam\u00e9rica y Europa."}, {"userName": "Krocht Ehlundovi\u010d", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54757979-krocht-ehlundovi", "userReview": "Siln\u00e1 ako k\u00e1va.

As in I will read practically anything under the sun if it has to do with WWII. I've read a lot of war novels before, but this one blew everything else out of the water. It is truly a war novel like no other.The Ups: Remember how I said Homegoing was the most ambitious novel I'd read this year? I lied...it's definitely Trieste. This book borders on the line between non-fiction and fiction so often that I can't even tell which parts are fiction or non-fiction. There are SO many facts imbedded into the text, which is why a lot of readers grew tired of the book after a while. It was overwhelming, but I decided to stick with it, especially because the facts were essential in creating a large picture of how terrible and huge the impacts of Nazi Germany were and are on the world. The general theme of the story, and a quote that is repeated multiple times, is \"Behind every name, there is a story.\" In fact in the middle of the novel there is a list of 9,000 Jews who were deported from or killed in Italy between 1943-1945. There is also a section describing the lives of many German officers and their terrible actions, and what little/no punishment they received. The horror and injustice and anger is enough to make your head spin, but that is what is necessary. Haya is referred to as a \"bystander\" of sorts, a citizen who turned her face away from all the terrible things happening to her friends around her. She, like so many others, is silent and doesn't speak up against the Nazi regime. Later, however, through her search for her missing son, it is shown that she is a victim as well; her son was stolen from her by the Catholic church to be used to purify the German race.This is a story that is trying to bring truth to a historical event some people are trying to forget. It shows the collaboration of the Church and the government in prosecuting the Jewish, it shows the corruption and secrecy that stills goes on TO THIS DAY regarding documents, it shows, most importantly, how everyone is a victim when we forget, when we say: \"It was too terrible, I don't want to hear about it.\"It was certainly not an easy book to get through. It wasn't graphic or extremely disturbing, but it was just so packed with facts and truth that it was unsettling in that respect. The Downs: I do think it is not an easily approachable novel form. I found myself wishing the plot would speed up, or being confused because I was skipping between German facts and Haya's story. I wish it was a little more approachable so its impact could reach more readers...but maybe without all its element it would not have been so powerful."}], "description": "Haya Tedeschi sits alone in Gorizia, north-eastern Italy, surrounded by a basket of photographs and newspaper clippings. Now an old woman, she waits to be reunited after sixty-two years with her son, fathered by an S.S. officer and stolen from her by the German authorities during the War as part of Himmler's clandestine 'Lebensborn' project, which strove for a 'racially pure' Germany. Haya's reflection on her Catholicized Jewish family's experiences deals unsparingly with the massacre of Italian Jews in the concentration camps of Trieste. Her obsessive search for her son leads her to photographs, maps and fragments of verse, to testimonies from the Nuremberg trials and interviews with second-generation Jews, as well as witness accounts of atrocities that took place on her doorstep. A broad collage of material is assembled, and the lesser-known horror of Nazi occupation in northern Italy is gradually unveiled. Written in immensely powerful language, and employing a range of astonishing conceptual devices, Trieste is a novel like no other.
