I was not able to follow any trace of \"meaning\" in it. It left me with impressions...of a life without meaning or purpose...life that is above all else fragmented and without cohesion...life that dwells on the microcosm because there is no sense of an overarching narrative. It felt cautionary...but didn't bother giving us enough background information to let us know what exactly to be cautious about. In that sense, it felt like a sort of a trick. At the end I felt like I'd listened to a person set up a really long, and often vulgar scenario that seems like it just MUST be a really hilarious joke. And then, no punchline! And so you get this feeling like someone just got their jollies by making you listen to their vulgarity in expectation, knowing that if you knew there was no punchline to it, you would have walked away a long time ago.It kind of reminds me of back when I used to work in a porn/adult novelty shop. We had a DVD player and TV behind the counter, and when people wanted to turn in DVD's for store credit, we had to put the DVD in and at least skip through it some to make sure it played so we could re-sell it. Most men would be kind of abashed and awkward when they were turning in their DVD's because I was this girl behind the counter and they felt weird that I was about to check through their porn. So usually, the guys would just kind of put the stack on the counter all covert-like and browse around the store until I was done. But this one \"regular\" we had would would bring in these enormous stacks of DVD's for credit, and then sit there at the counter all smug and watch me while I looked through his porn. It was clearly some kind of sick power game, where he knew he was kind of forcing me to watch porn \"with\" him, and he got some satisfaction out of that. Funny thing about porn stores, I suppose particularly stores that staff young women behind the counter...is you get some of the \"regulars\" who act like bouncers in a way, kind of hanging out at the shop and keeping the creepers in check. So once I realized what was going on, I had one of the cool guys scare the creepy guy away.Now I'm not saying that book was particularly pornographic...it had it's vile moments, but I get it. The vileness was part of the picture that the author was painting...I guess? The link here is more about that feeling I had at the end of the book...like...all I could think was \"That was really disturbing for no reason that I can figure.\""}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2375838-cheryl", "userReview": "A collection of snippets, some stories, some just descriptions without evident story arc. Some characters vaguely echoed in other bits. Sort of a precise impressionism.Very good. The second last one had a more conventional arc, with a satisfying ending. Probably even more satisfying because so rare. Most never arrived at the ending by the time they finished."}, {"userName": "Jared Emry", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69358123-jared-emry", "userReview": "A glorification of nothingness. While it claims to eschew a typical narrative structure, it really doesn't. All it does is remove the names of the characters of stories without point. This is no Faulkner or Joyce; it lacks all of the depth and all of the skill. Never make the mistake of confusing vagueness with subtlety - this book only has the former.The book follows a handful of story arcs that center primarily around the failure of the characters to do right in their circumstances, although you wouldn't expect it as the author intends to use even the most vile acts as a way to titillate his readers... and that titillation might just serve as the guilty pleasure that draws fans for this book."}, {"userName": "Monica", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4887959-monica", "userReview": "I think it is best to start with the publisher's description, because if I had been handed this book without recommendation or any idea what to expect, I would have been quite confused.One thing that is odd now that I think about it, is that there were no physical descriptions of appearances. I didn't even find myself wanting them. What I did find myself wanting was a name or a specific trait to classify them (purely to remember them by). The tales are certainly not linear and to be honest, the themes of war and migration didn't jump out at me. Although I think this is to the book's credit; the themes and ideas portrayed aren't shoved down your throat by repetition. The book left me with a sense of wanting to know more. I felt, unfulfilled because there were a number of characters I would love to know the whole story for. However, despite wanting more, I think that the book was a good length and snapshot just as it was. Anything lengthier in the same format and with the same narrative structure would have started to grate on my nerves. I would have become frustrated that none of my questions or wants were fulfilled. So yes, the story left me wanting more details and information about the events, but it was satisfying in itself.

Most vignettes have some sort of subject connection to the vignette previous to them, but one is unsure if any characters recur since no one is ever named. Pronouns are used throughout for characters.The reference to 8 x 10 is a grid. Each vignette is introduced by a grid of this size with one square darkened. Not all squares are represented, but the grid is worked top to bottom, left to right. The experiences described vary widely and include a variety of relationships, both intense and casual, intimate and passing. I found only one that seemed outright strange.To me, the structure and parameters of the writing encouraged thought and speculation. I found myself wondering whether the same character had reappeared, about whether one experience led to another, and about some characters mental health. A thought-provoking read."}, {"userName": "Peachy", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2095554-peachy", "userReview": "Odd snapshots into the lives of unknown characters from unknown parts of the world, often dealing with war or post-war time issues. Sometimes overlapping, many stories share similar imagery and/or characters, as obviously evidenced by the 'seven tree lined ridges' mentioned in multiple vignettes. I will not pretend to have understood most of what I was reading, but will admit that it all might have just been over my feeble-minded head. This would not be the first book of short stories that left me perplexed and feeling inept. In any case, I think that another reading would be in order to piece together this puzzle and possibly have a better understanding for what it is Michael Turner has done."}, {"userName": "Missy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3168898-missy", "userReview": "I'm obsessed with the patterns,the interconnectivity of the stories, and the threads that weave through each story.

Through a sequence of possibly intertwined events, Turner creates a challenging portrait of our modern age, drawing solely on the actions of people rather than their appearance \u2014 whether advertising executives or soldiers, tailors or doctors \u2014 they fall in love, have children, fight in wars, and flee their homes. In 8 \u00d7 10 there are no names, no racial or ethnic characteristics, and only a vague sense of time.
