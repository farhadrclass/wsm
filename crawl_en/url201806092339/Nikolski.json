The job was pretty simple. The mill would shut down for ten days of the annual top-to-bottom maintenance period, a lot of workers, both contract and union, would have to crawl into some very cramped spaces to work, and often those spaces were dangerous. My job was to put on a tonne of heavy gear, grab a first aid/emergency rescue pack and a walkie talkie, and sit outside a confined space for twelve hours a day making sure nobody died. I worked in the bleach plant, the recovery boiler, the chemical plant, flak dryers, precipitators, black and green liquor tanks, and a few places I can't remember the names for. I did it two years in a row (earning, in each ten day period, about twice my current monthly income), and there were never any accidents or emergencies on my shifts. I got a lot of reading done. On one particularly scorching afternoon I was working in the precipitators\u2014a relatively easy post, because there was a place to sit, it was easy to keep track of the workers, and there were normally at least three other watchers there with you\u2014and I happened to be seated next to a woman whose name I can't recall. The precipitators were an ugly, almost frightening place. To us it was a long, narrow iron corridor with iron doors on either side, like the watertight doors of a battleship. There'd be welders and other tradesmen (always men) on the other side of the doors, balanced on thin, tightly grouped iron rails, a great, black, breathing emptiness far above and below. Even in the heat of the afternoon it was a grim, dark place, like something David Lynch would have built for the Baron Harkonnen. We didn't want to think about our surroundings, and it was too filthy a place to bring a book, so we'd talk. The woman I sat next to on that afternoon told me what she did to pass the time. She would pick a person at random, me, say, or one of the welders, and imagine an entire history for them. Would they have a family? What did they do for fun? Where did they live? If she liked the way her story turned out, she would find a way, small and innocent, to put herself in it, to make it, just briefly, her own story as well. She never wrote any of it down. It all just happened in her head, and when she was done, she'd let it drift away like smoke.Nikolski is about serendipity, three characters whose lives barely brush up against each other, never quite connecting. Noah, the itinerant archaeologist, Joyce the dumpster diving pirate, and the unnamed bookseller with the ocean in his basement. They are united by the Book with No Face, by trash, and by a shared bond of blood that they don't even know exists. Set in Fournier, Lazer Lederhendler's translation is lovely to read as the three protagonists fumble in the dark, unknowing but, strangely, far from lost. That, I think, is the conventional reading, and it's certainly the best one.I'm going to offer an alternative.One of Dickner's protagonists, the only one without a name, and not coincidentlaly, the only one who is allowed to narrate his own story, works in the S.W. Gam Bookshop in Montr\u00e9al, the only place visited by all three characters. Nikolski begins in 1989 with him cleaning out his dead mother's house, taking with him the Nikolski compass\u2014a cheap plastic compass that points to the island of Nikolski, where our narrator's father lived and eventually died. It's the only thing he has left of his family. The novel also opens with garbage, bags and bags of it, full of history, of treasure, of the stuff that Noah and Joyce will build their lives with. I wonder if there may not somewhere be a Britannica of our desires, a comprehensive repertory of the slightest dream, the least aspiration, where nothing would be lost or created, but where ceaseless transformation of all things would operate in both directions, like an elevator connecting the various storeys of our existence. Our bookshop is, in sum, a universe entirely made up of and governed by books\u2014and it seemed quite natural for me to dissolve myself in it completely, to devote my life to the thousands of lives duly stacked on hundreds of shelves. This could be Nikolski, the book our narrator writes himself, the chapter in the Britannica that contains his slightest dream, the one where he has family, connections. I can imagine him sitting behind the counter, looking at the customers, seeing which books they buy (or steal), finding common ground, making up stories like the woman who sat next to me in the industrial hell of the precipitators. This woman buys books about marine life and shoplifts books about computer programming. That man comes in with a child and browses the dinosaur books. Before that, there was a woman, loud and frantic, with a book that was decades old and falling apart. How do these things connect? I see our unnamed protagonist as the narrator of the entire novel, taking his mother's collection of travel guides as a jumping off point and reaching back, creating a mythology of wanderlust and a family tree to support it, putting up the scaffolding that will let him build the courage to leave a life that holds no connective tissue for him anymore.Of course this is just me grafting my own experiences on top of a narrative that works exceptionally well as it stands, but I think that any book that can open itself up this way, that can be read as a complex, adventurous, but still accessible novel and like a box of puzzles and secrets, like a map to pirate treasure or a midden heap, is a book that should win Canada Reads. I have two books to go, but I think I've found the contender I'm rooting for. And as an aside, if this is the sort of thing that's going on in French Canadian literature, English Canada needs to get working on more translations as good as Lederhendler's."}, {"userName": "residentoddball", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1795722-residentoddball", "userReview": "I've never enjoyed being so frustrated with a book as much as I enjoyed the twists and turns of this one! I truly enjoyed reading Nikolski, but it took a lot of effort to keep the details straight.The first few chapters jump characters and settings quite dramatically, so much so that I thought I was reading three different stories. But gradually it all comes together, and you see that it's really part of the author's style, not to mention the foundation that allows for a clever unfolding of the plot.Not at all what I expected, Nikolski is a new twist on the theme of \"six degrees of separation\". Dickner subtly weaves the interconnectedness of the story's elements so exquisitely, you almost don't even notice. So often through the read, I laughed, smiled, tapped my foot in anticipation, smirked, considered sketching a diagram of my hypothesis, and at the end, found my jaw dropping in amazement.A challenging read, but nevertheless, a really really good one.***An additional note: I completely took for granted that this was a translated book.

But still, it's a 3 storyline book that should drive me bonkers but I dragged out the reading of it so I wouldn't be finished yet. Reading it, you suspect, hope, wonder, doubt if these unrelated plots and their characters will ever converge. It's all very slightly magical, but only slightly. The characters and their issues and adventures are all unusual, independent, adventuring types in very different ways, all digging in the past and searching out the cartography of the world in different ways, for their own answers. I don't know how to describe it and I'm not even sure what I just read. But it works."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5847727-laura", "userReview": "Much to the chagrin of my rock-music-lovin'-husband, I love talk radio. Specifically, I love CBC Radio 1. I listen to it every day. I listen to it at home, in the car, and I used to listen to it at work. I have my favourite shows: As It Happens, The Vinyl Cafe, The Current, and Q to name a few. (If anyone at CBC is reading this: Please bring back The Point. That was my absolutely favourite!)I also, obviously, love reading. So when CBC started Canada Reads, I loved the idea. National unity consolidated around one work of literature. I eagerly await the announcement of the finalists every year.To be fair, I'm not a stellar Canada Reads participant. Before 2010, I had only ever read three of the eight previous winners (2002: In the Skin of a Lion by Michael Ondaatje, 2006: A Complicated Kindness by Miriam Toews, and 2007: Lullabies for Little Criminals by Heather O'Neill) and I'm pretty sure I read two of those for school. I always planned to read the books. I even planned to read the books after the announcement but before the debate so that I could champion my own favourite. But life and school got in the way and every year I never got around to doing it.When 2010's lineup was announced, I was determined that this year would be better. I tweeted about Canada Reads 2010. I placed holds on all the books at the library.Here's the problem with library books. You can only read them when you get them and you have to give them back. Because I was so gung ho about placing holds on all the books at once, I got all the books at once. I had to return four unread. By that point, the holds list was so long I just had to wait for my turn to come up again.Eventually, I read two of the five shortlisted books:Good to a Fault by Marina Endicott and Fall on Your Knees by Ann-Marie MacDonald. By that point, I had been gifted an ebook reader (and the remaining books weren't easy to find as an ebook) and a winner had already been crowned: Nikolski by Nicolas Dickner.When I first picked up Nikolski, I needed to adjust my style of reading. The last book I read was much more of an entertaining read. With Nikolski, I was immediately swept into the literariness. I felt like I was back in university, scribbling all over my pages and thinking of the countless number of essays that could be written from the nuances hidden on the pages, except I'm not in school and I don't have to write any essays. (Oh, and I didn't scribble all over my pages. That would have ruined my ebook reader.)The language is divine. It is actually delicious from page one. Word choice is so carefully considered in this novel, which is interesting because the book has been translated from French to English. \"I crawl out of the sleeping bag and stumble over to the window. Clutching at the curtains, I watch the garbage truck pull up with a pneumatic squeal in front of our bungalow. Since when do diesel engines imitate breaking waves? Dubious poetry of the suburbs.\" page 8I really liked Nikolski. The characters are personal and engaging. Like many literary books, the plot isn't the most important tool that the novel uses, but I was still eager to find out what would happen. The book follows three characters who are deeply connected as they go about their lives, often oblivious to one another.Being a sucker for plot, I really wanted the book to give me more. I wanted the characters to become as aware as the reader was. I wanted to know what happened next. I am sure though, that if I actually got my wish, I wouldn't have found the literature nearly as good.I do struggle with whether I would suggest this book. I initially want to say Yes! Read it! but I am quite sure that this isn't a book for everyone. I suppose I would suggest that if you want to read a book that a large amount of Canadians are reading / have read, then pick up this novel. If you have an appreciation for literature and literary devices, then pick up this novel. If you are looking for an entertaining and exceptionally engaging page turner, then this book is probably not for you."}, {"userName": "Blake Fraina", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/860622-blake-fraina", "userReview": "Some books make you feel and others make you think.Nicolas Dickner\u2019s clever debut, Nikolski, definitely falls largely into the latter category. As a matter of fact, it still has me turning over its intricacies in my head months after I\u2019ve finished it. This tightly woven tale is packed with ideas that challenge customary thinking about the nature of personal identity. Dickner asks if who we are is a result of nature or nurture, genealogy or geography, or, perhaps, a combination of all four.Early in the story, we are introduced to the three main characters, all distantly related, although not necessarily aware of one another\u2019s existence. They are the unnamed narrator \u2013 a second hand bookshop clerk who is in possession of a compass that always points in the direction of Nickolski, a tiny Aleutian Island, Noah - son of an itinerant Native American mother and absentee father who learned to read from roadmaps and Joyce - restless young woman descended from a family of French-Canadian pirates. The three stories unfold in alternating chapters as each begins a pilgrimage to unearth their family connections, seek their place in the world, establish their destinies and find themselves.Like the Nickolski compass, the writer postulates that all people have a built-in homing instinct. A family of Dominican fishmongers, who rent a room to Noah and employ Joyce in their retail shop, despite being long time residents of Canada, hold a monthly \"jututo\" to enjoy their native foods and boisterously debate Dominican politics. And humorously, we see how Joyce (and her erstwhile mother) inadvertently fall into a twentieth century version of the family business - as computer pirates. Ties to place, ethnicity and family not only dictate our actions, but define who we are.This was a deceptively easy and enjoyable read. There was a certain sense of mystery, plus a fair bit of suspense, that pulled me along until the end. It\u2019s particularly impressive to see how the author weaves all the threads together. Much like the \"three-headed book\" that passes through the hands of both Noah and Joyce, before ending up on the bookstore\u2019s shelves, Dickner manages to stitch three disparate stories into one cohesive, and endlessly captivating, whole. Definitely one of a kind."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/563583-anne", "userReview": "\"Nikolski\" teases three unconnected, yet absolutely connected lives together in a complex tapestry of eccentric themes which include piracy, bibliomania, fish, archaeology and cartography. Weirdly, and with more than a whiff of magic realism, Dickner manages to pull off a story that is brilliantly implausible but perhaps is not! The translation is superb capturing all that is comic and poignant and perceptive about this truly Canadian romp (sans BC!). Five stars would have been awarded had the female protagonists been rendered as fully as the males -- we are left with a void regarding the enigmatic Joyce and the lesser but equally interesting Arizna, plus an ending that is satisfactory, but only just."}, {"userName": "Karalee", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2087264-karalee", "userReview": "This book is about three lonely, lost souls trying to find their place in the world. Noah, Joyce and an unnamed bookstore owner are all misfits who are connected in ways they do not realize and whose lives have a lot of parallels to each other, even if they are not conscious of each other. All three of them were raised by a single parent and they all have, for one reason or another, distanced themselves from their families and are making their way in the world alone. They all are searching for meaning in their lives and, in that vein, all have a fascination with their roots and ancestry. All of them have a strong connection to maps and/or travel guides. They all have a fascination with trash or discarded objects in one way or another. The bookstore owner sells used books, even ones that others have thrown away, Noah majors in archaeology with a fascination for the archeaology of trash, and Joyce becomes a trash-diving treasure hunter as part of her quest to become an cyber-pirate. The three story lines, although they intersect only tangentially, flow beautifully and the language is very lyrical (which is very interesting given that this book was translated from French and translations usually are a bit stilted). Of the three, my favorite character was Noah. He is so sweet and earnest and was a bit more focused and in control of his destiny than the other two. Although I adore books, bookstores and used bookstores in particular, I found it a little hard to relate to the bookstore owner because he is never identified by name and the author (perhaps deliberately) keeps the reader more distant from him. Joyce is a very interesting character but not quite as empathetic as Noah.Overall, this was an excellent first novel by Nicholas Dickner. He has a real flair for character development and for seamlessly incorporating quirky traits and elements into the story (the archaeology of trash being only one example). I will look forward to reading future books by him."}, {"userName": "Judy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22241323-judy", "userReview": "Quirky.

Totally redefining what a circus can be, the awe-inspiring athletic performances are paired with surreal costumes and makeup, strange staging and awkward-beautiful movements and singing. When I see a scene from a Cirque du Soleil show, I am usually left thinking, \"That is weird. Is it art because it's weird, or is it weird because it's art?\"\n\nI was often in mind of the Cirque du Soleil while reading Nikolski, written by Nicolas Dickner, as Quebecois as the creator of the Cirque. Is it a cultural quirk of those from the Belle Province to up the artistic value of their efforts by building rigid but invisible frameworks for their creations -- whether highly trained contortionists or precisely crafted phrases -- to leap and tumble from? What seems to work for the Cirque du Soleil fell slightly flat for me in this book.There is a wealth of clever wordplay (and I can only trust that the translator of this book was faithful to the feel of the original). \n She piles the books on the table, puts on her glasses as though she were putting on a diving suit, and plunges into her reading. When Noah shows up, fifteen minutes later, all that can be seen of the girl are the air bubbles frothing at the surface.\nAnd there were some obscure word choices. I loved that the cop's eyes were described as selachian (shark-like), but question the usefulness of words I don't know and don't think I'll need going forward like: metonymy ( a figure of speech used in rhetoric in which a thing or concept is not called by its own name but by the name of something intimately associated with that thing or concept) or fascicles (a bundle or a cluster). I do like to be challenged with vocabulary, but I am left wondering with some of the language in Nikolski if the translator was too literal, or if this the exact flavour the author intended.The plot was potentially intriguing: Three young people, unknowingly related to each other, are drawn to Montreal where they cross paths and fortunes over a period of ten years. But, as it turns out, their paths and fates remain separate, and the idea of there being significance in their meetings is brushed off:\nAnd that is exactly the trouble with inexplicable events. You inevitably end up interpreting them in terms of predestination, or magical realism, or government plots.\nAnd so, just as I accepted the warning to not interpret greater meaning, it dawned on me that the structure of Nikolski mirrors that of the mysterious \"Three-Headed Book\", a unicum, that keeps poking its head above the surface:\n\"A unicum. A book of which there is only a single known copy in the entire world\u2026It's made up of fragments of three books. The first third is a study on treasure hunting. The second comes from a historical treatise on the pirates of the Caribbean. The final third is taken from a biography of Alexander Selkirk, who was shipwrecked on a Pacific island\u2026The bookbinder salvaged the wreckage of three books and sewed them together. It's a piece of craftsmanship, not a mass-printed object.\"\nAha, I thought. So Noah is the treasure hunter, Joyce is the pirate, and the unnamed narrator is the one shipwrecked, having never set foot off the island of Montreal. The author is signalling that there is more craftsmanship on display here than I may be aware of. I have arrived at the thrilling climax of the novel, of the circus, what death defying coup de grace will leave me dazzled and amazed? The missing map? How intriguing!\nI stand there open-mouthed, contemplating the implications of this strange puzzle. Here is a discovery that clouds the issue rather than clarifying it.Nothing is perfect.I smile, shrug my shoulders and, after taping the map of the Caribbean into place, return the Three-Headed Book to the clearance box.\nOh, right. I'm not to suppose there's more meaning beyond the page. So is it art, or just a little weird? Nikloski is certainly well-crafted and precise, there's an air of the experimental about it, but it seemed to lack heart, and in the end, I may smile but, like the narrator, I also shrug my shoulders and contemplate the clearance box."}, {"userName": "Annabree", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4791971-annabree", "userReview": "Nikolski is one of those perfectly Canadian books that sheds light on the national mosaic. In particular, the lives of three individuals interweave in this story and sometimes they even cross paths with each other (not that they ever know it). Water, pirates, and garbage are some of the strongest themes in this story. Fish in the water each follow different currents, some staying in smaller geographic areas and others shifting from one current to another. I got the sense from this novel that the characters were like fish in the ocean's currents and sometimes they would pass by each other before moving on with their particular current.Seemingly disconnected from family and the world around them, Noah, Joyce, and the nameless bookkeeper each follow the current of their lives without ever reaching some goal-oriented, final destination. Noah studies urban garbage as an Anthropology major, Joyce becomes a cyber-pirate and dumpster-dives for discarded technology, and the unknown narrator (the bookkeeper) collects discarded books for a second-hand book store. I was particularly interested in the theme of garbage in this novel and Dickner's proposition that we can learn a lot about our world through the garbage we leave behind.The title \"Nikolski\" refers to a northern community off the Aleutian Islands. Unbeknownst to the characters, they share a common ancestor who ends up in town. The characters never really have a sense of direction in their lives (not that anyone does, and that's what makes this more true-to-life) but this far off place of Nikolski really anchors them and is a reference point from which they move. The bookkeeper keeps a Nikolski compass, which is a compass from Nikolski, and a gift from his unknown father. This unique compass doesn't point true North, but rather points to the town of Nikolski. The idea of the compass was really symbolic in this novel in that a compass can only provide a sense of direction in which one can move but it can't ever tell you where you are. And that summarizes the novel beautifully. The story was in the journey, not in the final destination.In the end, the novel never resolves itself. I never felt the three story lines were ever drawn together or even wrapped up at all. I appreciate that Dickner didn't wrap it up in shiny paper and stick a bow on top. It would be too easy to do that. It would betray the characters and the lives they lived.Overall, this was a great read. I think I will wonder where Joyce is in the future.

Basically, it\u2019s a battle of the books and each day one of the five books get kicked off and Nicolas Dickner made it to the end this year and took home the reigning title of Canada Reads, meaning that his book is the book that all Canadians should be reading and after reading it, I whole heartedly agree. We\u2019re introduced to three characters, one unnamed young man, Joyce and Noah. Dickner interweaves these three characters stories sparingly but successfully. We learn the back stories of each character which provides insight into why these individuals are each so complex. Each character ends up in Montreal, Quebec (where Dickner resides) arriving in the year 1989 hoping to create a better life for themselves. Noah is there to pursue his goal of studying archeology, specifically the archeological dig of garbage. In the novel he explains, \u201cAs a rule, archaeologists don\u2019t take much interest in nomads. The more a population travels, the fewer traces it leaves behind.

Ironically enough, she spends a majority of her time digging through garbage to collect discarded computer parts, in order to gain illegal access to the internet (aka piracy).It is a clever and humourous read filled with lots of different ideas that are woven into a collection of 290 pages.

Finally, and not to be overlooked the \"magnetic north\" and the title of the novel, Nikolski, a village one of the small Aleutian islands off Alaska. Sounds a bit like a mystery story? In a way, yes, as first time Quebec novelist Nicolas Dickner spins a delightful yarn around his three primary characters, either moving to or through and/or living in Montreal until...Noah, who, until he was eighteen, lived with his mother a nomadic life in a trailer, crisscrossing the western regions of Canada, arrives in Montreal to study archaeology and discovers the \"archaeology of trash\" as an intriguing topic, \"trash being the artifacts of civilization\" and much \"fishing\" is involved. Joyce, from a long line of Doucettes of dubious reputation in Atlantic Canada, pursues her ambitions to live up to the family's tradition and to become a modern-day pirate. She also goes on fishing expeditions, but of a different kind: she scrounges through industry trash to find all the bits needed to get a workable computer built and much more... Finally, a first person narrator of a kind, who runs a second-hand bookshop also has some fishing to do...Do these characters link together in some way? Are the connections stronger than strangers meeting in the night? It is for the reader to find out.

Along the way, Dickner's easy-going, ironic style hits a few punches at Canadian multicultural society and the modern way of life. His descriptions are off-beat yet apt, whether he describes certain areas of Montreal or of one of the other islands in the novel. The novel won the 2010 Canada Reads competition, and the sensitive and lively English translation won a major Canadian award."}, {"userName": "Steven Langdon", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5864496-steven-langdon", "userReview": "\"Nikolski\" features some of the most remarkable characters you will ever find thrown together in a single novel, never really interacting in any continuing way, yet building a collage of a book that has impact and humour and meaning despite its incoherence. There is Noah, deserted by his father, who grabs hold of accidental paternity and thrives as a doting parent of the sort he dreamed of having. There is Joyce, who seeks to become a pirate of the sort she dreams her absent mother became. And there is the nameless narrator so wrapped up in the world of books -- who deciphers the ancient three-faced book that comes to symbolize this tripartite novel. You may never have a firm feel for where this book is going, but that won't, in the end, matter that much. It is where these characters interact -- in the rich cultural stew of Montreal -- that makes this novel vivid. And it is the meaning each manages to create in their lives, despite difficulties, that gives this book its impact. This novel won major literary prizes in Quebec when it was first published (in French) and also reached an English audience successfully, winning the CBC Canada Reads choice for 2010. Read the book, and you will understand why it has received such recognition."}, {"userName": "Karli", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/982356-karli", "userReview": "Gabriel Garcia Marquez meets Big Fish. I am not sure I could give a summary of the motley cast of characters and their unusual lives as there were 3 different stories running simultaneously, always threatening to run together yet never really did. 1. A hermit-ish booksellor in an old used bookstore who wears a compass that points to Nikolski where he believes his father, who he never met, must be. 2. A young orphan who comes from a line of pirates, determined to be one herself, forages into the dark and lonely night-time wanderings of office garbage so that she can go into information piracy. 3. A young man who grew up in an airstream trailer as his mother navigated the Canadian plains, now doing his doctorate as a garbage anthropologist. Wacky, well written, magical, different, entertaining. I can honestly say I had a smile on my face for much of it."}, {"userName": "Mircoffen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4754112-mircoffen", "userReview": "I had to think about whether I liked this book or not. It was like watching a movie that grew on you the more you thought of the memories of it rather than watching it at the time. The book was mainly about 3 characters that had connection to each other, but were mostly just ships passing in the night. They never actually connected and didn't really have much direction of their own, but each was quirky in their own right. The book just kind of starts, goes along and ends without anything being tied up. That kind of bothered me at first, but then the characters were kind of like that too, and somehow it made the story more likeable and somehow more novel than most books that nicely wrap up in the end. And it did have it's entertaining moments."}, {"userName": "Louis", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1232696-louis", "userReview": "First off, I love it when a book's setting is in my hometown.I just find it makes it easier to get right into the book.It's actually three separate stories that are all somehow linked to each other.The three main characters (who I really liked) all interact with each other for brief moments.I started off giving this a Four but as I was writing this review, I realized it actually touched me more than I tought and gave it a Five.

I have to say there is much about this book that I really loved. I heard someone say on Canada Reads that they felt this was a \"thin\" book and I have to agree with the book's advocate that it depends on how one reads it. The characters and their background stories fascinated and hooked me as did the idea of what goes on in a large city during the night. A different take on what constitues identity and family and a lot to say on the subject of aloneness. I wasn't bothered by the ending and the fact there was no resolution for the characters.

But I really found the style humorous and engaging. At page 100, I was thinking \"I wonder where this is going?\" At page 200 I thought \"I have no idea where this is going.\" At page 300 I thought \"I guess this probably isn't actually going anywhere.\" And I was right, but that's not as much of a reproach as it usually is. In this book, it's really all about the journey and the strange ties that connect us, even when those ties lie undiscovered or never manage to bring us closer together. What kinds of connections? A book that we've touched, a largely-unknown family member, a chance mention in a newspaper, a landlord with a day job, and more.This book is better than its Goodreads score. At least the original French is.And just a note about my rating system for reference. After each little quote below, you have to add the words \"For a book of its type.\" A 4-star rating of a romance novel does not mean it's \"better\" than a 3-star rated work of English literature. It just means \"It's good...for a romance novel\":1 - I wouldn't recommend the book to anyone2 - \"It's fine...\" I would recommend it to people who might be particularly attracted to it.3 - \"It's good...\" Better than \"It's fine.\" It has broad enough appeal or enough craft that I would feel comfortable recommending it more generally.4 - \"It impressed me...\" The book is so well-crafted that I would recommend reading generally except for people who I feel are disposed not to like it or who won't be able to appreciate it.5 - \"It's astounding...\" The book has characteristics that elevate it above other entries of the same type, which I won't try to enumerate.
