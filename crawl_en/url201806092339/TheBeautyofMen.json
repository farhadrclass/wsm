This was particularly disappointing considering this is one of his very favorite books. Rather than empathizing with the overwhelming despondency over the way the AIDs crisis, geographical isolation, personal circumstances, and unreciprocated desire has left the main character's life in a state of utter ruin, I was surprised to find myself more wrapped up in\u2013and ultimately moved by\u2013the gut-wrenching sadness hovering over his mother's debilitating health condition(s). I still find it a bit mystifying that I generally seem more capable of relating to the queer literary output of the pre-Stonewall era than the literature that blossomed under the advancement of the Gay Rights Movement, and while acknowledging its great accomplishment, literary skill and observational acuity, The Beauty of Men ultimately reaffirmed this situation yet again.[Capsule review from the post \nMy Year of Reading Queerly\n over at my blog, Queer Modernisms.]"}, {"userName": "Adam Dunn", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5895037-adam-dunn", "userReview": "More than a book about the aftermath of the AIDS crisis this is really a book about aging in a youth obsessed gay culture. I had made the decision to read all of Holleran\u2019s work after reading Dancer from the Dance and Grief, but after reading this book and Nights in Aruba, I am rethinking.Ultimately concern about growing old, especially to this mid-life crisis level presented in the book, just seems so vain. I\u2019ve heard this story before from others, how they are now invisible when they go into a bar after they reach a certain age. These same people will acknowledge that they treated older men the same way when they were younger but are now painting themselves as the victim when it happens to them, as if a 20 year old was looking to hook up with someone who\u2019s 60 on a Saturday night.I don\u2019t really understand this and I don\u2019t have much patience for it. When I went out when I was younger I never went for the best looking guy in the place, I went for someone uniquely attractive to me and let my attitude and enthusiasm carry me through. My personality has only gotten better with age, easier to control, so I don\u2019t feel I\u2019ve lost anything. I found the sections of the book about Becker, Lark\u2019s ideal and one-night fling almost impossible to read, I\u2019m reading them looking through my fingers because I\u2019m cringing so much. Even Lark\u2019s rationale for loving Becker is flawed, as this passage about late-night trysting place the boat ramp reveals:\u201cBut that\u2019s why I love Becker. He doesn\u2019t go to the boat ramp! He went that one night just to see what it was like. And he\u2019s never been back since. He said he liked to talk to people first. He\u2019s the exception to the boat ramp. An escape from the boat ramp.\u201dSo Lark goes to the boat ramp to meet someone who doesn\u2019t go to the boat ramp. Do you know how many gay men do this with the bars to this day? It\u2019s maddening and self-destructive and if you can\u2019t get yourself off this cycle I don\u2019t really have time for sympathy.The book is well written, as is all of Holleran\u2019s work, and full of great observations:\u201cThe functional disappear at the baths almost immediately: They are having sex. The dysfunctional remain in view, sitting in the TV lounge or on a bench in the locker room, like Lark\u2014a penitent in the street before Santiago de Compostela, asking only the pity of the passerby.\u201dI just wish the characters were a little more aware of themselves. I did like Eddie, the 70 year-old man who cruises during the day like others play golf, it keeps him busy. He goes home to his dog at night and Lark sees it as terrible, every gay man\u2019s worst nightmare, getting old alone. I see Lark\u2019s life as the nightmare, caught up in the past and unable to live in reality. Give me a dog over this any day."}, {"userName": "Frederick", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/117377-frederick", "userReview": "This is a very controlled novel about isolation. Published in 1997, it is the story of a gay man who has been almost entirely cut off by the gay community. Because of the AIDS crisis, he finds virtually no gay men his age to befriend. Younger men have no desire to know him, for a variety of reasons: He is not young, he is not powerful and he is not wealthy. Above all, the specter of AIDS causes other gay men to be wary of him. He is a pariah among gay men due to his date of birth.This novel could have been maudlin or preachy. Instead, it is intense without being shocking and angry without being rageful. The prose is graceful. I would recommend this to any serious student of literature."}, {"userName": "Adam", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2691043-adam", "userReview": "Although I find Holleran's writing to be beautiful especially when setting the scenes endlessly switching from flashback to flashback, I couldn't get into the content with enough conviction.

Very little happens - the narrator pines after a one-night stand while caring for his quadriplegic, elderly mother. Things don't come to a head until the book is almost over. Holleran is a real charmer with description, and I love how expansive and meditative he is. The main character is a self-admitted hypocrite when it comes to judging others for their age and beauty. He suffers a loneliness that we watch him inflict on those around him. The last four or five chapters, which follow a confrontation with the unrequited love, are the best in the book and stand among Holleran's best work. The book is purposefully meandering, though. I love Holleran's writing, but I did feel that the first two-thirds of the book were unnecessarily repetitive. It's tough - repetitive it's what this sort of story calls for. Anyway, this is a very powerful book about aging and loneliness. Holleran's Grief is this book's unofficial sequel. Though that book is more compact, I much prefer the expansiveness and intimacy of this one."}, {"userName": "Timothy Juhl", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1060129-timothy-juhl", "userReview": "Perhaps one of the most haunting books I've ever read, with sentences that still resonate for me.

The protagonist is Lark, a middle aged gay man who is faced with the cold truth of lost youth. Lark's life is filled with aimless midnight cruising and lonely moments of despair in his empty apartment. He has lost his professional drive a long time ago and most of his closest friends have fallen victim to the AIDS epidemic. Lark's whole existence is completely saturated with the dull despair of someone who grieves after lost opportunities and the beauty he sees around him and is now unable to reach.\"The Beauty of Men\" is a lament, but one that doesn't feel over the top or too self conscious. It's an honest and beautiful character study filled with keen observations about a modern life as it is gradually nearing its latter half. Holleran's language is lucid, yet lyrical and melancholic.It's extremely disturbing how obsessively Lark grieves because he cannot satisfy the sexual longing he feels towards men he is now invisible to. Even more disturbing is how desperately he longs after the feeling of desire itself. I thought the numbing of primal urges is the main good thing about growing old and supposedly wise. Well, however it actually goes, Holleran's writing is alarmingly plausible.In the middle of all the bitterness about unattained beauty and longing, aging and eventual death are most effectively present in scenes that takes place in a nursing home Lark visits daily to take care of his paralyzed mother. The interaction between mother and son is powerful in its hopelessness and sad beauty. And the atmosphere of a place where life is quietly dimming is strongly presented and I think crystallizes the essence of this magnificent piece of modern literature."}, {"userName": "Benjamin", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36005341-benjamin", "userReview": "Lark is in his late forties, a single gay man he left New York in the 1980s to care for his ailing mother in north Florida. In New York he had an active social life clubbing with his friends, but now twelve years since leaving most of his friends are gone, victims of AIDS, and in Florida has made few new friends other than a few men he meets at the boat ramp, a remote meeting place for gay men. It is at the boat ramp the he meets Becker, a handsome younger man he falls in love with and with whom he becomes obsessed, but Becker seems not to be interested beyond their one night stand. Lack spends his time visiting in turn his nursing home bound mother, the gym and the boat ramp, all the while looking out for that illusive man who will love and stay with him, ever hoping that Becker will be that man.This is a rather forlorn story of a lonely man, convinced at his age he is no longer attractive, unable to find what he wants in life. He ponders his past and the loss and suffering of his friends, and wonders how it is he has escaped the scourge that has taken them, and fears he will lose his mother to old age soon. while this is without question beautifully and extremely well written, I did not find it an easy read. It took a while to get involved with the story, and I found it often depressing, a sad indictment of the way gay men treat each other, especially when they start to age. It has it touches of humour, but I found often I could not laugh for the humour is derived from the sadness of the situation.I did enjoy the book, mainly because of the sheer beauty of the writing, but I found it somewhat morbid in tone."}, {"userName": "JSidelinger", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4856737-jsidelinger", "userReview": "\"The Beauty of Men\u201d is a poignant story of loss and loneliness told from the perspective of Lark, 47 years old, residing in Florida to take care of his invalid mother. Lark was young in the heyday of the 70\u2019s when beautiful men enjoyed a carefree hedonism yet unaffected by the AIDS epidemic. It is a sad story filled with pathos and angst, as Lark recounts his friends from his glory days (all of whom have died), while he is aging alone without love, yet continually seeking it in the places he feels reduced to haunting for brief encounters \u2013 a secluded boat ramp as an example. There is a sense of melancholy pervasive from beginning to end in this story, but Holleran writes so elegantly, capturing the character\u2019s sense of diminishment so precisely, you appreciate the writer rather than the mood evoked. Lark is a healthy middle-aged man. He is experiencing the natural aging process yet cannot seem to reconcile himself to it. Instead of acceptance and appreciation (he\u2019s alive, he made it through the plague - his friend\u2019s did not), he mourns the loss of youth and beauty - searching it out like the Holy Grail - an acolyte at the altar of younger men rather than the priest. As I read the story of Lark, I kept remembering Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnet 29, \u201cWhen in disgrace with Fortune and men\u2019s eyes, I all alone beweep my outcast state\u2026And look upon myself and curse my fate.\u201d \u201cThe Beauty of Men\u201d is eloquent and poetic although I found it somewhat heartbreaking at times.

He has a sexual encounter with Becker, a man a little over a decade younger, and becomes almost obsessed with the man.
