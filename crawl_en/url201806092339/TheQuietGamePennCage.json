That novel was Natchez Burning, and if you're ever at BAM or any other brick-and-mortar bookseller, check it out. Shoot, maybe you own this marvel of modern publishing. I wanna have babies with that hardcover. Papercuts on my dinglehopper be damned! Anyfuck, I'm wiping drool from my mouth as I pull out my phone and bring up my Goodreads app. Fuck my couch and call me Naugahyde, Natchez Burning is the FOURTH goddamn book in a series starring author/lawyer Penn Cage. What's a book junkie to do? Start the series at the beginning, that's what.Horribly tragic side note: The Bone Tree (Penn Cage #5) just came out and it's just as fucking sexy as it's predecessor. My lights are gonna get cut off, people, but at least I'mma have some pretty books to read by candlelight.Back on track. After ogling Natchez Burning, I traipsed over to my second favorite stomping grounds (Trade N Books in Montgomery, AL) to find the first three Penn Cage books because BAM didn't have any of the earlier novels. Bad BAM! Shame on you! Luckily, my used bookseller had the first and the third books in the series. I bought them posthaste. This was two weeks ago. I went back today, after having finished the first novel last night, and they had the second book. Series acquired. Let the Greg Iles marathon begin!The Quiet Game is one of those novels that defies categorization. It is equal parts action, suspense, courtroom drama, and literary novel. There's even a bit of horror toward the end. (The last meeting with Ike Ransom was intense and disturbing. Two words: Bone fragments). And the final court case damn near gave me an anxiety attack. I know absolutely dick about lawyer-type shenanigans, but I understood everything in this book. Iles does a fantastic job of dropping knowledge on your ass without making it feel as if you're taking a law course at a community college. In other words, this novel is never boring. It grips you from the first page and hooks you through the bag until the end. I read the final 200 pages in a day. Couldn't put the book down. Iles ends every chapter in such a way that you feel the pressing urgency to continue on. And when you do put the book down you feel as if you've lost a friend. In summation: I could go on and on about the terrific twists and the brutality and the tragedy and the stellar dialogue but I won't. I will tell you to read it and find out for yourself. Now would you kindly fuck off so I can start the next book in the series. Peace!Final Judgment: You'll break the bank searching for the rest of this guy's books."}, {"userName": "Phrynne", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne", "userReview": "My first book by this author and I am not quite sure how to rate it. Firstly it was far too long. I like long books but only when the length contributes to the narrative. This one was just padded and I did skim large parts of it.Then it had far too many and too violent deaths with apparently no repercussions. At times it seemed every character was getting bumped off without a policeman in sight. Or if there was one he was corrupt. Unrealistic.On the other hand I found Penn Cage a very likeable character and wanted to hear more about him. I felt that the author could have made a lot more of the court room scene and a bit less of being shot at and riding water rapids in an inflatable dinghy.The story was good and there was plenty of excitement. It really just needed an editor with a red pen to reduce it to an appropriate length. Having been assured by someone whose reading choices I trust that Iles is an excellent author I will try another of his books."}, {"userName": "Janie Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5116650-janie-johnson", "userReview": "This is by far the best I have read from Iles so far. A very riveting tale full of lies, deceit, mistrust, and brutal honesty. The plot was brilliant, the characters even more so, so vivid that you could place yourself there among them. My favorite character would have to be Penn Cage. I can honestly say that I will not forget him for a very long time, if ever. I look forward to the other books in this series. I can only see Cage becoming even more amazing.I loved the twists that Iles included in this book. As soon as you recover from one, he gives you another to ponder over. The plot was so believable, that it got me thinking about how real it all could be. All the possible cover ups, conspiracy, FBI, the government at it's finest. Iles takes you back in time to life in the 60's in the deep South. And then brings you up to present day with a Prosecuting Attorney, turned Author, trying to right a 'very' wrong. Simply Awesome!It is a very fast paced, exciting read. I became so involved in this story I could not even dream of putting the book down. At first I thought it was gonna get way too political for me but that was not the case at all. So many surprises that keep you turning the pages. I loved every minute of it. This is definitely suspense at it's finest."}, {"userName": "Lewis Weinstein", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2231715-lewis-weinstein", "userReview": "This was an excellent read, with interesting characters and plot, and sustained tension.It also provides a look at the ugly prejudice against blacks that apparently still exists in the deep South, including among some in law enforcement, and the hypocrisy with which people try to hide but not deal with or change their feelings.Iles has at least two instances of unexpected help coming from unexpected places, a device that often gets to me. He also has his main character (author Penn Cage) reflect on how sometimes writing blocks can be solved by just stepping away from the page and letting the words sort themselves out in your subconscious. Obvious, I guess, but still a useful reminder."}, {"userName": "Britany", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5550397-britany", "userReview": "Penn Cage is a famous author with his own personal demons, after unsuccessfully trying to move on from the unexpected death of his wife, he takes his young daughter Annie home to Natchez, Mississippi to be with his family. Natchez brings back memories that Penn didn't expect, chief among those is a 30 year old murder motivated by racial tension, politics, and class warfare in 1968. The mystery aspect was interesting, although slightly predictable and not nearly as exciting as all the attempted murder plot points inserted throughout the book. While there was lots of action, and some lovable characters, the book left me wanting more from the story. It dragged on in parts, and could have been cut down significantly. Penn Cage is an engaging character and one I found myself rooting for, however the ending was a little too complex and overly wrought for my liking."}, {"userName": "Tammy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19481265-tammy", "userReview": "Absolutely great!

I read a brilliant review of Natchez Burning, and discovered that it was the 4th in the Penn Cage series. While the review was clear that it's not necessary to read the first three to appreciate Natchez Burning, I am a bit obsessive about reading mystery series in order. A long rationale, but mostly it ended up being worthwhile. I like Penn Cage. I like the setting. I liked the plot. It kept me reading to the end wondering how it would all unfold. But parts of it were a bit trashier than I usually enjoy my mysteries. Also the pacing was a bit crazy and there were long stretches of uninteresting violence. So 3 stars will do it for this one. But the negatives were not enough to turn me off from reading the rest of the series, and in fact I have now started no. 2 in the series, which I am enjoying more. So I might make it to Natchez Burning..."}, {"userName": "Pamela", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4894054-pamela", "userReview": "How I rated this book.All books start with 5-stars then have stars or partial stars deducted. 1. This book was not jaw-droppingly amazing in the way The Remains of the Day or Things Fall Apart were. Neither was it brilliant, ground-breaking, and thought provoking like pretty much anything by Jonathan Coe or by Denis Johnson is. Deduct one star for non-brilliance. Rating now at 4-stars.2. First person. I am not particularly in love with first person. There are times when it works and times when it doesn't. In this case, it's a draw. Deduct no stars or partial stars for first person, but keep in mind when rounding.3. Present tense. I abhor present tense. The only reason for it is in the case of an unreliable narrator as in Fight Club. In this case, the present tense became so annoying and so completely unnecessary that I was forced to skim the verbs so that I could pretend it was in past tense. Did this change the tone or impact of the book? Not one bit. Deduct 1/4 star for unnecessary present tense. Rating now at 3.75 stars.4. Were the characters, the plot, and the action believable? This lawyer is on the scene and involved in several murders, yet never reports them. He is shot at, beat up, threatened, and knocked silly yet he still keeps a tickin'. The characters aren't badly drawn, but they are clich\u00e9: The old flame, the new girl friend, the perky little girl, the rich and powerful bad guy. The list goes on and on and on. And the twists! Gracious the twists! I lost count of how many there were. A few twists well done add spice and interest to a crime novel. This many turns it into drudgery. Deduct 1/2 star for unbelievability.Rating now 3.25 stars.5. How does the book rate with its genre contemporaries?Iles has to compete with the contemporary crime writers such as Michael Connelly(his earlier work), Jo Nesbo, etc. He tries, but from the beginning of the book, it's obvious that he is playing way above his league. Deduct 1/4 a star for missing the bar.Rating now at 3 stars. 6. Did I learn anything about the setting, the main character's occupation, or human behavior from this book.Paul Doiron has taught me more than I ever wanted to know about what it means to work in the backwoods of Maine.Jasper Fforde has opened my eyes to the world inside books. Tony Hillerman has taught me about the Navajo people. It is important that writers entertain as well as open your mind to new places, people, thoughts, and experiences. I'm certain that Iles felt he was explaining the culture and people of Mississippi while writing. Unfortunately, he failed and failed miserably. Coming away from the book, I felt that not only did I still not understand modern Mississippi's problems stemming from the Civil Rights Era, I felt that I was being handed a line. When the writer spoke through the main character's thoughts, rather than hearing the explanations and justification that I'm sure the writer intended, I just kept hearing same old tired cop-out: \"But don't you see? Some of my best friends are black.\"Deduct 1/2 star for failing to open a new perspective on an old or unknown topic.Rating now at 2.5 stars.7. Rounding. Because Goodreads doesn't allow partial star values, and because of the first person irritant, I'm rounding down 1/2 a star.\nFinal rating: 2 stars"}, {"userName": "\u262eKaren", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1076079-karen", "userReview": "4.5 starsNatchez, MS, is from where Penn Cage hails and, following the death of his wife, to where he flees with his little girl. Good memories abound, but danger now, as he looks into a 1968 unsolved murder of a black citizen. His ex, Livy Marston, comes back at the same time, and he wonders if they'll have a second chance at love. She escaped years before, and her father set forth trying to ruin Cage's father for some mysterious reason.Looking up from the bridge, I see Natchez as the tourist sees it: the high bluff where sun-worshiping Natchez Indians massacred the French soldiers of Fort Rosalie in 1729; where Aaron Burr was arrested as a traitor and set free to the cheers of crowds; where an African prince labored twenty years as a slave; where Jefferson Davis wedded Varina Howell in the halcyon days before the Civil War. But I see so much more. I see the city Livy Marston captivated with a beauty and poise not seen since P. T. Barnum brought Jenny Lind down the river in 1851. I see the thin edge of a universe of vibrant life and mysterious death, of shadowy secrets and bright facades, and of races inextricably bound by blood and tears, geography and religion, and above all, time. \u201cThis is a good place to be from,\u201d I murmur.Natchez is definitely a main character of the book, and I love Iles' descriptions of it, despite the fact that I know I'll probably never set foot there. Other characters are well drawn and interesting. Also present are the ghosts of long-gone folks like Medgar Evans, Martin Luther King, Jr., J Edgar Hoover, and Cage's deceased wife, to name a few.In no time, Penn stirs up the citizenry, who all seem to know who was responsible for the murder but won't talk about it. Even the FBI had been involved, and Hoover sealed the files on the case. All playing \"the quiet game.\" This only makes Cage bolder and more curious to investigate further.There is a bit much going on in this town and in Cage's world to keep up with, and the book being on the longish side became rather exhausting. Answers came slowly, but when they came, wowza! It definitely made me care for Penn Cage and continuing on with another book or two from this series."}, {"userName": "Edwin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8061727-edwin", "userReview": "I only recently discovered Greg Iles (Summer of 2010). The Quiet Game is the second book of his that I have read. Yes, he is a better read than Grisham and his characters are more alive and his description of events closer to home. A little too much violence and murder to be real, but it is a thriller and that is why we are reading him. Iles is particulary adept at bringing the reader into the relationships, and creating the chemistry of Penn Cage and Livy and Penn Cage and Caitlin is nothing short of masterful. The sexual content is descriptive and sensual, yet not crass. We have all experienced some of what Iles is telling us when he laments about the past and the present and what we wanted and probably left behind with no hope of ever recovering. As a trial lawyer I am a bit critical of some of the procedural legal gaffs in this book, but they do not detract from the theme or pleasure of reading the book. I don't know anyting about Mississippi legal procedure so I may be wrong anyway. What intrigued me about this book is Iles honest discussion about race. There are so few books, movies, media reports or other dialogue that so honestly deal with the race relations of our country. He calls it as it is, at least from his perspective as a southerner. We should all be so honest. This book is a page turner and I found myself unable to put it down. If you have not read the book, you should."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/598440-mary", "userReview": "This book had me trapped in the stinging closet of self-loathing for the very short time it took me to race through it. And thank goodness is was fast-paced, because oh my God did it cause some eyerolling that would have been medically marginal had it continued unabated. The characters were so incredibly stereotypical and alternately condescending/patronizing in so many ways that I audibly sighed to myself while reading this, as if to beg myself to turn back and put this book down. But I couldn't. It was a fun romp and an enjoyable, not too wreckless waste of brain cells. If you like a good murder mystery and don't mind the phrase \"poor man's John Grisham\" constantly running through your head, pick it up today!"}, {"userName": "\u2665 Sandi \u2763\t", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4984609-sandi", "userReview": "Penn Cage goes home, to Natchez, Mississippi, after the death of his wife to find his father is being blackmailed.

It took me almost a month to finish it, after putting it aside several times because the buildup was so, to put it nicely, leisurely. Somewhere around the 100 page mark, it finally picked up and my interest was piqued. It is also very long - my copy, a rather tall paperback, is over 600 pages in length. In all honesty, I think it could have been at least 100 pages shorter and nothing would have been lost. Some of the scenes are very drawn out and there are some scenes I don\u2019t think are really necessary to the plot. I don\u2019t like filler in the books I read and I feel there is quite a bit of it here.That said, the story is strong and engaging. Penn Cage, a prosecutor and best-selling author, has returned to his parents\u2019 home in Natchez, Mississippi, following the death of his wife. Penn is still trying to cope as is his young daughter and, with the impending execution of a man he put on death row and the ensuing media circus, it is definitely a good time to lay low with family. What was supposed to be a break for Penn, however, turns into a personal hell as he learns that his father is being blackmailed by a very sketchy character who is also a ex-cop and ex-con.To add further to his troubles, during an interview with Caitlin Masters, an ambitious local journalist, he mentions a decades old cold case that is long-considered to be a racially-motivated murder. A young man, Del Payton, was blown up in his car in 1968, just days after the murder of Martin Luther King, Jr. Payton, a civil rights worker, was a veteran of the Korean War and he was about to be promoted to a new position at the factory where he worked - a position his white colleagues felt was a \u201cwhite job.\u201d Penn, under the impression that the conversation is off the record, says more than he should and the next morning, after Caitlin has written and printed a story about the unsolved murder quoting Penn, the poop hits the fan and many in the town are angered, leading to violence and threats. To make matters even more complicated, Penn finds Payton\u2019s mother and widow on his parents\u2019 doorstep, pleading with him to find out who murdered Del and to bring the killer to justice. So, instead of finding peace and quiet, Penn finds himself trying to help his father with his blackmailer and also trying to solve a murder that is thirty years old and may involve officials high up in government as well as a man who almost destroyed Penn\u2019s father. The story that follows is full of ups and downs, suspense and lulls, tense scenes full of gunfire and mind-numbing scenes involving Penn and his annoying, selfish ex-girlfriend, Livy. When the suspense is there, it is full on but from time to time, it drags as the more mundane parts of the investigation are pursued and, among other things, as Penn\u2019s relationship with Livy is explored. The Quiet Game is a really good book with some wonderfully-written characters. Watching Penn work to discover the truth is often exciting. So many characters are playing the \u201cquiet game,\u201d basically the last one to talk wins and there are a lot of characters not talking about the Del Payton murder. Iles does an excellent job of describing Natchez past and present. It\u2019s hard to read at times with the racial slurs and the prejudices in both the 60s and 90s. Occasionally, since the book is set in the late 90s, it becomes dated, but not overly so, with the mentions of beepers, camcorders and Sally Jessy Raphael, whose original talk show disappeared in the early 2000s, I believe. While I enjoyed the story, the characters and the twists and turns, the length and slowness did dampen my overall enjoyment. I\u2019m really surprised to see quite a few reviews calling it fast-paced from page one. It was several dozen pages before I would call it fast-paced and even then, there were places were it just idled. I also did not like the use of present tense, I always find this distracting in books. Eventually, I got used to it but I am still not a big fan. Iles is a very good writer and The Quiet Game is an intelligent, complex book but I\u2019m not sure I would read anymore in the Penn Cage series. I glanced at the descriptions and lengths of the next books in the series and I feel they would be more of the same. I won\u2019t say never but definitely not anytime soon."}, {"userName": "Judy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5778052-judy", "userReview": "Two thumbs up to Greg Iles for a stunning legal thriller. I was totally engrossed in this page-turner which is packed with courtroom drama, politics, scandal, secrets and lots of action. I love the character Penn Cage, who is now a best-selling author but earlier was a prosecuting attorney in Texas. Penn and his young daughter have returned to Natchez, Mississippi after the death of his wife in the hopes that his parents can help the 4-year-old get back to some semblance of normalcy. After a short time with his parents he finds out his father is being blackmailed. Penn becomes drawn into the investigation of a murder that happened in 1968, 35 years earlier, where a young black man was killed by a car bomb outside the factory where he worked.

Penn Cage is an intelligent writer and semi retired attorney who has a knack for detective work. I liked how his character was introduced and how we were given just enough of a look into his past to let us see why he can be vulnerable at times and ruthless at others. He has a good true nature and never lets on to others just how truly intelligent he is in order to keep them guessing and a little off balance without knowing why. This story has a little something for everyone: personal grief, revenge, deception, love, danger, espionage and blindsides. Dick Hill was a great voice for this character and kept a good fast pace without rushing.

Now, the clock is ticking for him to unravel the twisted hometown history and fight his own demons before they destroy everything that he holds dear. Family secrets, conspiracy, greed, lost love and murder.Not a short read by any means - There is more than enough action and backstory to fill the pages.

It had crime, corruption, love, hate, jealousy, idealism and more. The story revolves around an unsolved 1968 murder in the deep south, a town called Natchez in Mississippi. The settings, characters, dialogue, plot, outcome all are believable. I loved the characters, even the ones I didn't like, if that makes any sense at all. It's not often a book keeps me up late into the night reading. I seldom have trouble setting whatever I'm reading aside at bedtime - I like my sleep.

For many years now, I have been devoted exclusively to John Sandford. This is not a bad thing--his books are awesome--but after being on GR for awhile, I began to dimly perceive that there might be other crime authors out there worth reading, as well. Following that hunch, I chose Tana French and Greg Iles as the first candidates that I would interview for the positions of backup crime authors. Tana French's first novel, In the Woods, I thoroughly enjoyed, and I also read her second. She has made the cut.I was not as enthralled by this book as I was French's, but it was very enjoyable, too. I liked that it was set in the south. Having been raised in a small southeast Texas town, I could readily identify with the structure and unspoken rules of the Natchez community. I just felt like some things were a little too convenient for Penn at times. I felt the chemistry in the relationship between Penn and Caitlin, but never with Livy.

Greg Iles is a good writer, but he needs an editor who will make him cut the redundant passages in his books. The Quiet Game is 559 pages long. At various points, I skimmed at least 100 pages of it. Set in Natchez, Mississippi, the plot revolves around the 30-year-old unsolved murder of a black man, which Penn Cage, attorney and best-selling novelist, must solve. There are more skeletons in the closets of Natchez mansions and police departments than you can shake a snake at, overt racism including the n-word, and more than a few hinky cops and FBI agents. Romantic complications include Cage's Southern-belle-turned-lawyer high school sweetheart and a smart female newspaper publisher. The problem: Cage's wife recently died of cancer and his six year old daughter is so freaked out by this she has to sleep in the same bed with him. There are plot twists galore, a few too many of them near the end. SPOILER ALERT Some of the action near the end just wasn't credible: shootouts in dark warehouses, an impossible ride down a river in a rubber kayak, a long-lost daughter who may or may not have been the product of incest. That said, Iles brings the book to a satisfying conclusion in a tense well-drawn courtroom drama, and the Southern atmospherics were also a plus.

It's a 559 page thick paperback.With that being said, you should know why I rated this a 5.This was an incredible book.

Penn decides to go back home to get the emotional support he needs. Once home, he discovers some ugly secrets that is haunting his family and he decides to try and help his family deal with their ghosts.Enevitably, this stirs up some ghosts from Penn's past and he is caught up in memories that have always been at the surface.The thing that kept me riveted is the fact that there was a little something revealed at each page. And the action never stopped. This was a definite page turner and I woke up early this morning to read it. That hasn't happened in a long time.This is the 3rd Greg Iles book I have read.

Since the QUIET GAME is my first foray into his world of fiction that holds tremendous historical resonance, I was trying to place him among the novelists I am familiar with. I have come to the conclusion that tinges of John Grisham and Pat Conroy are present in his work. Though these similarities may be present, Iles has a sharp pen, loaded with human emotion that easily galvanize the reader. This approach is present in his first Penn Cage novel, THE QUIET GAME. Cage a successful Houston lawyer and prosecutor, in addition to being a bestselling author returns to his hometown of Natchez, Mississippi and his parents\u2019 home to try and overcome the grief he and his young daughter Anna are coping with since the passing of his wife and the child\u2019s mother. Almost immediately he is confronted with his own past, and that of Natchez.First, in 1968, Del Payton, then employed in the Battery Plant in town was murdered in a parking lot when a bomb exploded as he entered his automobile. Once a friend of the martyred civil rights leader, Medgar Evers, Payton was a voter registration organizer at the time of his death, making him a threat to the local powers that be. Second, Penn\u2019s father divulges a family secret that years before his Aunt Ellen had been harassed, raped, and beaten by her ex-boyfriend. Before learning this, Penn\u2019s father, a doctor in Natchez had loaned a 38 pistol to a former policeman, Ray Pressley. Later, Penn\u2019s father learns that Pressley had killed his sister\u2019s tormentor with that same gun. A third strand that Iles weaves into his story is Judge Leo Marston, who years before as District Attorney tried to ruin Dr. Penn\u2019s medical practice with a bogus malpractice prosecution. Though acquitted, Dr. Penn suffered a heart attack that almost ruined his career.When Penn returns to Natchez he is approached by Del Payton\u2019s widow to try and obtain justice for her dead husband who was killed thirty years earlier. Since the FBI and the local police did little to try and uncover who had committed the murder she approached Penn. After some trepidation, that will turn out to be totally warranted, Penn takes the case and in seeking to uncover the truth he learns that Judge Marston probably bears some responsibility for Payton\u2019s murder and Presley, dying of cancer may have planted the bomb. Iles integrates all three strands and ties them together in creating an intriguing exploration of 1960s Mississippi politics and its relation to Washington, D.C., in addition to southern society and politics that should be an anathema today. Iles creates a series of characters that fit his story line nicely ranging from newspaper heiress, Caitlin Masters, Judge Leo Marston, who represents the evil of the \u201cgood old boy\u201d southern power structure, John Portman, an field agent in the 1960s, who thirty years later finds himself Director of the FBI, Livy Marston Sutter, the judges daughter who had a relationship with Penn in high school, Ike Ransom, a tortured black Vietnam veteran who wound up on the Natchez police force, and Dwight Stone, a former FBI agent who is blackmailed from divulging the truth, and many others. The key question in what motivated Payton\u2019s murder; race, political power, money, or all three. As the novel unfolds and Penn gathers a great deal of damning evidence and moves closer to the truth murders occur and threats become almost routine.What separates Iles\u2019 approach from other writers is the complexity and layers that he weaves throughout the plot line. Penn is confronted with an explosive situation when he discovers that the recently approved head of the FBI, a bipartisan congressional choice because of his supposed liberal civil rights record as an agent in Mississippi in the 1960s was in some way linked to Payton\u2019s murder. Like the pealing of an onion, Penn develops a strategy to force Marston and others to come forward in an effort to bring about justice. The lies and cover-ups abound and Penn chips away until he is certain of the correct path he should follow. In a manner that most investigators and lawyers would not chose, Penn risks everything to learn the truth, and the question that comes to the reader\u2019s mind throughout is how far Iles will go in playing with your emotions as the book becomes difficult to put down. Iles raises many provocative questions throughout the book. One of the most interesting is why then FBI Director, J. Edgar Hoover, sealed the case files of the Payton murder using the excuse that it was for national security reasons. Another question that emerges is the relationship between the FBI and the racial politics in Mississippi throughout the civil rights period. To learn the answers to these questions and others you will have to read the first installment in Iles\u2019 Penn Cage series, and the reader is in luck because there are four more installments, the most recent NATCHEZ BURNING was just published."}, {"userName": "Judy Collins", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11063006-judy-collins", "userReview": "The Quiet Game (Penn Cage #1) by talented Greg Iles, delivers a stellar performance with another Southern Gothic suspense thriller with juicy details, violence, scandal, conspiracy, courtroom drama, a murder mystery, and race relations in the small town of Natchez, MS. The Quiet Game opens, with Penn Cage a prosecuting attorney turned bestselling novelist, (yummy) returns to his hometown of Natchez, MS with his four-year-old daughter, to recover from the tragedy of his wife\u2019s death from cancer. He finds himself caught in his own past, his dad\u2019s past, both which comes with dark secrets and risk to his family.Penn discovers his father, a respected physician is being blackmailed by a Ray Presley, and meets intriguing sexy and beautiful, Caitlin Masters on a plane which later be finds out is a former ambitious former Boston publisher of The Natchez Examiner.  (No time for grieving, now)Caitlin and Penn (love this duo) find themselves working together in a trail of lies, a notorious race crime, the murder of Del Payton, and a black factory worker killed by a car bomb and helping Del\u2019s widow, Althea Payton to re-investigate her husband\u2019s murder. To make things interesting, there is much pressure and corruption and a conspiracy, with those dangerous players, protecting their past secrets and threatening those who want to uncover them, even involving the FBI. The Payton murder case opens an old can of worms and intersects with the Cage family and the secrets of Livy Marsden, Penn\u2019s former lover and Leo Marsden\u2019s daughter, and of course, the former J. Edgar Hoover. (This is exciting stuff)!  Forced to confront powerful Judge Leo Marston, who nearly destroyed his father in pursuing an unrelated, unfounded malpractice accusation decades before, Cage must also face Marston's daughter, Livy, his old high school sweetheart, (scandalous), who tries to persuade Cage to let things remain as is.From the witty southern humor to the violence from Natchez to the Colorado Mountains, this legal thriller, will keep you turning well into the night to learn the fate of those involved.An engrossing novel which can only be told by Iles, as he tackles all sorts of moral issues to protect his family, leading to redemption. I agree with the other reviews, the novel is edgy, and written brilliantly, for a satisfying thriller! Read them all \u2013 you will not be disappointed! Tom Stechschulte, narrator of the audiobook, delivered an outstanding performance!Since I started with Iles latest, Natchez Burning #4  (5 Stars), I jumped back to #1 in the series, to The Quiet Game, as was intrigued and wanted to learn more about the characters (these two are my favorites in the series, thus far)!\u201cI will do those things which make me happy today and which I can also live with ten years from now.\u201d \u2015 Greg Iles, The Quiet Game"}, {"userName": "Robert Rosenthal", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7183677-robert-rosenthal", "userReview": "A good fast-paced read, with action, mystery, and quietly compelling, tasteful sex. The local color (Natchez, on the bluffs of the Mississippi River) plays a starring role, perhaps with more verisimilitude than some of the characters. Very good plotting. Some of the best prose I've read in a thriller novel. Iles really does know how to write. Yes, there are the heart-strings twisting cliches: a lone celeb dad and his daughter recovering from the death to cancer of his wife; the good country doctor (McCoy Southern style) and his wife; the power-hungry, unprincipled FBI director; and the retired, hard-boiled Clint Eastwood-like FBI agent brimming with integrity. But the truly badass Southern cop is no stereotype. The character of Livy Marston was convincing. Apart from her simmering sexuality (yup, I'm a guy, and it worked on me), the inner tension and mystery surrounding her past carried through right to the end. I would like to have seen more conflict on Penn's part around his attractions to Livy and Caitlin Masters -- both stunning, wealthy, daring, but from different cultures, North and South. But once Livy appeared on the scene, she seemed to suck the oxygen out of Penn's relationship with Caitlin. A shame. Seems there was some good ore left there unmined. Perhaps the author felt it would've diverted from the main plot line, but I have faith that if he'd given it his attention, he could've pulled it off. I would have rated this book 5-stars but for two things. The big conspiracy it's centered around just didn't carry the kind of impact it needed to. So rather than climax and denouement, it was a bit of a ho-hum. The second was a glaring oversight on the part of protag Penn that seemed totally uncharacteristic and designed solely to set up a surprise reveal during the novel's climactic scene. [I'll give more detail below after the Spoiler Alert line.] But all in all, this is a good one -- far better than much of the junk they pass off these days under the Thriller genre.SPOILER ALERT BEYOND THIS POINT:The scene in question is when Penn learns from that the waitress in the bar who thinks she's his illegitimate daughter that she has actual recordings of phone conversations between the New Orleans crime boss and Leo Marsten. Penn blithely shows no interest. In real life, anyone in his situation would've been all over those tapes asap. This allows Penn to introduce the waitress and tapes at the trial and carry the day. A bit of cheating by the author, in my opinion.
