I downloaded the first book in the series for free and soon discovered that this unknown author had a talent for writing. I thoroughly enjoyed the first book, finding it engaging and entertaining. Mr. Cook had me hooked and I quickly purchased and downloaded the next two books, confident that I would enjoy them as much. I was not disappointed.In book two, we learn that after two years from the outbreak, the zombies are less of a threat to the living because they've learned how to distract and kill them. As a result, survivors are grouping together and developing small communities. Crops are grown, specialty stores open, limited manufacturing begins - money doesn't exist anymore, bartering is now a way of life with caravans and trading between communities growing. The U.S. government survived and is trying to regroup the country from deep within the Colorado mountains. Unfortunately, not everyone in the country remains loyal to them, splinter groups and outlaws have joined forces and roam the country in search of these caravans and small communities; once locating them, inhabitants are murdered and their supplies confiscated.Eric and Gabe come upon a family of three prior to leaving their fortress in the Appalachians, then band together for the trek to Colorado. En route, they continue to battle zombies and outlaws. Once in Tennessee, they are ambushed by one of these outlaw groups - intent on taking the lone female and all their supplies for themselves. Outnumbered three to one, the small team hold their own and kill many of the attackers. However, three in their group are wounded - Eric is the worst and need immediate medical attention. Suddenly, a lone sniper comes to their aid, an acquaintance of Eric's from the first book, taking them to a nearby safe community with a medical doctor and supplies. Their totals number less than a hundred souls, and already have an elected mayor and sheriff; all pitch in to defend the perimeter against the undead and outlaws; both wanting and needed what they are defending.Eric recovers from his wounds and finds a love interest within the small community. Both he and Gabe decide to stay on for a while, accepting the challenge to develop and train a militia group to destroy the outlaw forces that now have the community surrounded.Once starting, you don't want to put the book down. The benefit today is that book 3 is already available and I jumped right into it before even writing this review. The first two books in the series are highly recommended...I remain confident that book number 3 will be just as good! Great job Mr. Cook!John Podlaski, authorCherries : A Vietnam War Novel"}, {"userName": "Bobby Cooper", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6735164-bobby-cooper", "userReview": "After reading No Easy Hope, I thought going in to this that there was no way James Cook could top the first one. I stand corrected!! The characters are well developed,his writing to me just flows like poetry,but not at the stories expense. It had plenty of action and heart. You get to know the characters on a much deeper level,and new characters are introduced. You will really love the direction this story goes and I just wish the next one was already out!! THIS GUY CAN WRITE!! YOU WILL GET LOST IN THIS TERRIFYING WORLD COOK HAS CREATED!!"}, {"userName": "Alex Bobl", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10737987-alex-bobl", "userReview": "As somebody with a military background, I could really appreciate this book. There've been too many zombie books just lately - the market is over over oversaturated - and quite a few are written by people who don't know the difference between a gun and their own backside. The author's remarkable attention to detail makes the story spring to life - this is a mature, intelligent take on the zombie apocalypse theme that makes it sound too real -prophetic, even (touch wood!). Overall, an excellent novel worth every minute of your time."}, {"userName": "Betty", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5125948-betty", "userReview": "The editing of the second book in this series was better than the first, but that's really not saying much as it was virtually nonexistent in the first. And again, this is a book in desperate need of a proofreader. It is obvious that whoever is doing the proofing, if anyone, is someone who has read previous drafts of the manuscript. How else to explain words that are missing or out of order other than a proofer who is \"seeing\" the words on the page as they should be and not as they actually are?The gross misogyny of the first book has been toned down a bit, as has the frat-boy dialogue. And losing those distractions from the first book has resulted in the story being far more entertaining.Pacing was a huge problem in this book though. To say the first half of the book was many pages of not much action understates the problem. Up to the 48% mark the book consisted of Eric and Gabe introducing three new characters to their cabin, some weapons and fighting training, cooking meals, organizing supplies, and killing zombies. Yawn. This couldn't have been covered in half of that length? Yes, it could have, but only with a good editor who thinks editing involves making the story and the writing better, not just reading a manuscript.I did like the humanizing of Gabe. He's still too much of a super-soldier, but at least he's getting some nuance to his character.My other big complaint is the ending, which read like the author realized what his page count was and just stopped. I know it's a series, but it might have been nice to have a resolution of at least a plot line or two. Readers are either going to stick with the series or not, and leaving everything dangling isn't going to get those in the latter category to change their minds (and it might piss off some of those in the former group enough that they walk away)."}, {"userName": "Marie Bayer", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31069717-marie-bayer", "userReview": "Decent enough for a light read.

This is a synopsis.The book opens during spring time with Eric and Gabriel out searching for supplies. They happen to see three people cross the road below them. They track them for a few hours back to their camp. Their camp is only a few miles from Eric and Gabe's cabin. Eric and Gabe go cautiously approach their camp and introduce themselves. It is a family. Tom (dad), Sarah (mom) and son Brian(12). Eric and Gabe come back the next day and have a fresh Venison dinner with them. The day after that Eric and Gabe invite the family to move into their cabin with them. The family agrees. The family moves into the cabin while Eric and Gabe live in the bunker. They end up all getting along very well. After a week or so E&G tell the family that they are heading to CO and the family can have the cabin. The family is extremely grateful. Sarah is pretty and used to be an FBI agent. One day some some Z's somehow make it through the gate and get into the perimeter. Everyone starts killing Z's and notices that they keep coming. Someone notices that the chain to the gate has been cut. Someone led the Z's here to take care of the family. Eric hops up on a car roof and can see that close to a thousand are coming. E&G send the family into the bunker. E&G end up luring most of the Z's off the back cliff of the property. The next day as they are cleaning up Eric catches a glimpse of light and looks up in the woods and sees that it is someone with a rifle scope. He has everyone take cover while he fires at the guy and takes off after him. He runs the guy down and ends up shooting him a few times. Before the guy dies he tells E&G that there are a group that plans to take over the cabin.E&G and the family lay a trap for the group. They set the cabin up to look like it was overrun with the Z's and everyone was killed. Tom and Brian hide in the bunker while Eric, Gabe, and Sarah lay in waiting. When the bad guys show up they kill them all.This incident makes Tom and Sarah nervous about what happens the next time this happens and E&G are gone for CO. The family decides they are going to CO too.E&G make a 2-3 day canoe trip to Marion to get some medical supplies, and other stuff. Marion has quite a few Z's around town. Eric lures them off and doubles back. They scavenge quite a few medical supplies and then hit a gun shop. They find a set of matching fancy M4's and tons of ammo. They also get some new axes for everyone from the hardware store. They gather it all up and head back. They see a lone survivor fishing from the dock but she runs off into the woods.They get back, rest for a day and then head off to CO. The plan is to have 3 people ride the MUV with trailer ahead and then stop and wait for the other to walk and catch up.Gabe is developing a love interest for Sarah. Gabe knows this is wrong but cant seem to stop himself. Eric politely asks Gabe about it. not much though.They meet up with a 60 year old man who is a retired sniper. He recounts a story when he was in North Korea and saw a camp that had Z's in it. He also says that after he got out of NK and the Marines he told his grandpa. His grandpa told him that he saw some Z's (or similar) during WWII with the Nazis. All of this was just to say that this has been going on for a long time and the Americans didn't. invent it.They are on the road for a few days. On the last day of their fuel they run into a road ambush. They take fire and retreat to the tree line. Eric gets shot. The bad guys are surronding them. The bad guys are being led by a guy with a bullhorn. Gabe runs up into the trees through a hole he makes in their line. Gabe gets shot in the shoulder. He takes out a couple bad guys. Brian gets shot in the leg. Gabe goes berserk. Gabe kills picks off bad guy after bad guy from behind their lines. Just as he is about to kill the leader someone else snipes him.All the bad guys get killed. Gabe and crew get moving before too many Z's show up. Steve (from the last book) pops out of the brush 10 minutes up the road. Steve takes them to a way station and back to the community at Hollow Rock.This is a walled off community with some hydro power. They seem to be doing all right for themselves. Eric takes a few weeks to recover enough to leave the hospital. Gabe and Brian heal up quickily. Eric has a weird dream during his recovery where his dad gives him some guidance. Eric and the doctor get a thing going on. Tom starts doing construction work for the town. The town mayor asks Gabe to form an army as repayment for the towns medical services. It seems that the group of raiders (name) is slowly surrounding the town and baditing all the shipments coming in. The mayor wants to fight them. Steve fills Eric in on his friends from the community from the last book."}, {"userName": "Rosemary", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17065900-rosemary", "userReview": "This Shattered Land took the Surviving the Dead series to another level altogether. The characters seemed to grow and the author obviously put a lot of thought into their growth and the direction the story would take. Eric and Gabe are all set in the cabin Gabe had prepared for the long haul. They had pretty much everything they needed, including solar panels, hot water, guns and ammo. What they didn\u2019t have, they foraged/scavenged for in the neighbouring towns.But, as can be expected, it was not an easy existence. I can\u2019t even begin to imagine how difficult it must be for two people, even good friends, to live in such close proximity to each other for months, or years on end, without interaction with other people. It would drive anyone crazy after a while.Added to that, was the fact that they had to be constantly on the lookout for zombies, or even worse, other survivors. As in real life, those who do not have, will want what you have, nothing changes, it just becomes more dangerous \u2013 a matter of life or death, so they need to be vigilant at all times. This added to the fact that they needed interaction with people eventually started to wear on them and they eventually decide to leave their safe haven, and try and get to Colorado.While searching for medical and other supplies they would need on the trip, they meet a family of three and decide to join forces and try and get to Colorado together, and so their journey begins.This was a very good read, but left me with the awful feeling you get when you know you will need to wait months for the next installment.

I found the character development to be better and the details about all the various weapons was not quite as overwhelming and annoying, although the author did still spend what I considered an inordinate amount of time describing them. You are a gun buff...we get it already! :)The zombies didn't dominate quite as much in this second book. Oh, there were several encounters with them, of course, but the survivors are getting better at eliminating their threat, so the battles with them are becoming almost ho-hum now--like shooting fish in a barrel. But, a different kind of menace is taking the place of the flesh-eating monsters now and is one that is almost more chilling--the cold, heartless survivors who are taking advantage of the situation to kill, rob and terrorize the others.The pacing of the book was quite slow in places, and I still found there were a lot of unnecessary details about everyday, mundane things.

I think this is the best series of survival in a post-apocalyptic world I have ever read and I have read a lot over my years as an avid reader.mi don't just read about the apocalypse, I read what readers in general read, but I always come back to this genre.The characters are fleshed out nicely, the action is paced nicely as well. There are moments where you have to suspend your beliefs a bit but that makes for a very good story, written or film.This series never mentions the Z word for the undead, this fictionalized world was not obsessed with Zombies as our world is today apparently! This is my first time reading about an undead end of the world, EMP, alien invasion or comet strikes have been what I looked for until the show Walking Dead, I thought I wouldn't want to read about them, wrong, The End Of The World As We Know It is the hook for me.I highly recommend this series, I've read 3 already so I have faith that however many is left, I hope quite a few, I am confident I will enjoy them just as much."}, {"userName": "michael alan cast", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41310177-michael-alan-cast", "userReview": "Coming right along......you know how some Z books are all about run run, bang bang, and run some more? Well, I gotta hand it to Mr. Cook here, he is writing a heck of a story. The core characters really have some substance.

They've traveled together, and every group of people they meet, the two leave a lasting impression. Battle hardened, they March their way through obstacle after obstacle. Their on their way to Colorado to join with a group of Americans (and the President) and the last vestiges of unity left in our country before the U.S. descends into a wasteland of scattered factions and gangs...But Colorado is a thousand miles away.

We're introduced to plenty of new characters, including a whole new town.
