There is lots of detailed suggestions for a wide range of activities, dining and shopping experiences. I also liked the fact that the title only focused on the coast and not the entire state. Will definitely be looking at more Moom Guides."}, {"userName": "JG (The Introverted Reader)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48404-jg-the-introverted-reader", "userReview": "This book does a good job with hotel and restaurant recommendations but I don't feel like I have a great idea about what to do anywhere, especially in Acadia. I know there's a separate book for the national park, but only 8 pages in this one, most of it just about the Loop Road and the Jordan Pond House, makes it not worth the money. I know I can use Tripadvisor to figure out what I want to do, but I like my travel books. I want all the details at my fingertips. I don't know if there are better books about coastal Maine, but there are definitely travel books with better layouts that I've used religiously for other parts of the world."}, {"userName": "Melanie Mcdaniel", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10502579-melanie-mcdaniel", "userReview": "I didn't care for the layout.
