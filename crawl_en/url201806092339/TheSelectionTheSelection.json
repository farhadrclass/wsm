It's really small and really bad for you and not really that satisfying but shit if you don't enjoy it. Because, no matter how superior you think your tastes are, you will enjoy this. Even just on a voyeuristic level. You just have to forget all of the stuff you know. Like, all of it. Forget what you learned in civics class and don't you dare remember even one page of that history textbook that your teacher shoved under your nose when you were eleven. Don't untangle those headphones; don't try to line up the yellow smarties. This book is a house of cards. Really cool to look at, but totally flimsy.(And the controversy is such a shame. It's a shame that the creative minds behind this lovably fluffy duck-down are the sort to hurl expletives at honest, non-inflammatory reviewers via Twitter, which is literally the weakest way to attack someone, because were your reasons so flimsy that they wouldn't fill out more than 140 characters? Come on.)Personal shitstorms aside, this book has about as much class and substance as its creators, but that's isn't to say that it didn't nicely pad out a two-hour train journey from Dundee to Glasgow. That commute, especially on a Friday lunchtime, is a snore. Add that to a tiny waif of a story with all of the addictive allure of crack and you've got two covers that you can turn in one single sitting.I'm not going to lie to you and say that I didn't have preconceived notions about this one; I mean, come on. The social drama was embarrassing. Add that to a name like \"America Singer\" and you've got a character I'm expecting to hate. But the thing was that I totally didn't.I have a bit of a problem with those who expect teen girls in YA books to behave like street-smart successful thirty-year-olds with enough life experience to be able to judge any situation with a clinical and businesslike edge. I know I wasn't like that when I was sixteen, and neither were you. When I was sixteen I fell in love with a supply teacher and thought that having chipped nail polish made me look edgy. America is kind of like me. She's probably kind of like you, too. She's over-dramatic and foolishly optimistic and she gets swept up by a single kind action from a cute boy. So what? She's a teenage girl. She's also careful, restrained and compassionate. She doesn't swallow bullshit like it's Orange Julius. She's believable. I'm not usually a huge fan of the whole \"I'm special because I'm plain\" which this whole book does use as a giant smoke screen for its sexism: there's the inevitable conversation in which someone says that big groups of girls always means there's snarky bitching and tons of competition, which doesn't hang together at all if you look at what is perpetuating this competition. Cass gives us commentary on girls and their competitiveness without actually tackling the reasoning behind that, which is of course a society whose foundations rely on a lack of camaraderie between women and this idea that in terms of relationships, men come first.Who is funding, perpetuating, and benefitting from the Selection? Maxon, who will gain a wife, and the king, who will solidify his dynasty. The queen is merely there for decoration; she says and does nothing of import. This book, had it not been the Nutella free sample of dystopia in which there's no greater peril than running out of bow tie pasta and having to resort to lasagne sheets, could have been a fantastic allegory for the way in which women compete and are punished for it, when in fact it is men and male benefactors specifically who both incite and perpetuate said competition. We are supposed to hate Celeste because she's our stereotypical heartless mean girl - and YA caters only to the insecurities of those who are visually plain, placing girls who wear lipstick into a terribly unflattering light and only exacerbating \"types of girls\" - when in fact Celeste and her desperation to climb the social ladder is a blinding example of what this patriarchal power imbalance between men and women has created in Cass's world. That is, the idea that male acceptance and male pleasure has infinitely greater value than that of women. This idea that men and romance comes first, and female friendships threaten that, and get her! Tackle her! Don't let that *hussy* steal your man! He's all that gives you value, remember?Calling out \"all my friends are guys, there's less drama because girls are bitches\" gives me immense satisfaction. When I hear that self-important special snowflake shit it makes me want to hurl. Is that any way to speak about your fellow woman? Do you understand the waves that women can make when they work together? This book is nowhere near as bad in this area as it could have been - but we weren't spared disapproving glances at Bariel's breasts or the constant commentary on Celeste and her ridiculously exaggerated competitive antics. Do me a favour and spare me another wasted concept, because there's no peril to this, and because there's no peril, the story has no weight. None of these girls are being forced to do this. There's monetary gain involved but America's family are not exactly begging for scraps, are they? Why on earth we're watching a middle-class girl agonize so deeply over a silly competition that she chose to enter is beyond me. What's further beyond me is the whole caste system, and why it's even in place, and why this book is a dystopia. This could have been a four-star read for me had it been set in a high fantasy world, maybe in a kingdom called Candy Land where everything was frivolous and silly with an undercurrent of darkness and social instability. But let's look at the technicalities of this. We have a competition with no negative outcomes that everyone adores except the faceless \"rebels\" who lack any real presence and who are portrayed as nasty barbarians when in fact what they're rebelling against is fat cats sitting in a palace eating fruitcake while children in the lower castes starve. The prince for whom they're competing is hot and charming and sweet. Goddamn, nothing about this is dystopian. You might look at the poverty pointedly but is the poverty ever explored in any meaningful way? Is there ever any real commentary attached to it? No.Let's cut out some plot tumours. Add in some polygamy. What if we took this fluffy frothy dystopia lite and added in a little danger? What if? What if the king, a nasty creepy dude, wants a new wife every year? He already has twenty or so. So let's say that each year he holds a Selection to choose a new one. Girls are picked based on their photographs. They are forced into the competition against their will. When America arrives, she must fight through a competition for the heart of a man she loathes, surrounded by girls at whom she initially looks through a judgemental lens, before realizing that they are all doing what they can to survive, and forming powerful bonds with them; each girl who is struck off from the competition is executed, because the king will not allow another man in the kingdom to marry a girl he has touched. Meanwhile, rebels march on cities around the southern rim of the country in the name of avenging the daughters and sisters they have lost to the Selection. Meanwhile, America is torn between secretly loving the boy she knew outside the competition, whose family has pointedly joined the rebels, and falling for Prince Maxon, the king's seventeenth son, who lives in the shadow of the king's first son and heir. What if?Jesus, just add some fucking peril to your dystopia. \"But it's light and fluffy! It's not meant to be serious!\" you say. Newsflash: dystopia is a really goddamn serious genre. Dystopia is a genre that is built around social commentary. Don't you dare come in and fluff up a genre that was created as a platform for authors to offer creative, intelligent critique and discourse on some of the most controversial and powerful social issues in the real world. Dystopia is a gift; dystopian stories can make us better people. This is not a dystopia. It is just silly.Honestly? This book could have been so much more. It could have been powerful and groundbreaking. It's not like the writing was anything special (in some places, it's just plain bad. This book is filled with some of the most unnatural and stilted dialogue I have ever read) or that any of the characters, even those I liked (Maxon was an unexpected favourite of mine, even if he is a two-faced spineless dingbat), grabbed my attention enough to make me give a crap. It's just one big pile of wasted potential. And I am so suspicious of authors who say that they \"write without agenda\" because one cannot claim to do impossible things. Every single piece of writing in existence has agenda, big or small, powerful or menial. Don't say that you just wanted to write a little light-hearted dystopia that nobody should take too much to heart. Don't. Don't do that. Don't do what Lauren DeStefano did when she wrote about rape and polygamy and forced marriage and sex with thirteen year olds and then claimed that there was no social commentary behind it, and that she wasn't trying to say anything with her writing. The fuck? Don't fuck with really serious issues and then try to wriggle out of readers' concern or curiosity by claiming that you \"didn't mean anything by it\". That's lazy and also sort of insulting. All of that said, don't be too surprised by my three-star rating. I'm sorry, but I couldn't award less to a book that engrossed me so, and that was such guilty fun. I was absolutely hypnotized."}, {"userName": "Wendy Darling", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2745288-wendy-darling", "userReview": "[I was afraid early on that the book was headed into really tasteless territory since the girls are asked point-blank whether they're virgins (and have to sign contracts saying the Prince can demand anything he wants of them and they cannot refuse), but fortunately it doesn't get much more gross than that.

But when a series gets to be this popular, I can't help needing to know why. I have friends who LOVED this and friends who HATED it, so I had to see for myself.Firstly, the names. Okay, I\u2019d already made peace with America Singer before going into this book. I knew that was her name, I knew it was silly, but whatever, it does not maketh or breaketh a book. But I didn\u2019t know that America Singer was - wait, it\u2019s too good - a singer. Honestly, why did the author think that was a good idea?People try to excuse her stupid name with \u201cbut Katniss Everdeen was a ridiculous name too\u201d. Yes, it was. But let\u2019s think about how much worse it would have been if she\u2019d been Katniss Evergreen, local fir tree.Secondly, this book really is just like The Bachelor and nothing else. I know we can jokingly compare the competition of beauty pageants and various reality shows to The Hunger Games, but the fact that this is seriously being compared to putting kids in an arena and letting them kill each other is just hilarious. This is about a beautiful girl who gets so pissed when people comment on her obvious beauty:\n\"Please don't call me gorgeous. First my mom, then May, now you. It's getting on my nerves.\" By the way Aspen was looking at me, I could tell I wasn't helping my \"I'm not pretty\" case.\nOh, the pains of people thinking you\u2019re gorgeous.This beautiful girl enters The Selection - a contest of sorts where the poor competitors volunteer to compete for the heart of a handsome prince.You\u2019ve probably heard that there\u2019s very little world-building, but I actually wish the author hadn\u2019t bothered with the bit of world-building she tried to throw in. It draws more attention to how bad it is by the vague mention of poverty, children being beaten for stealing food, social castes that are distinguished by numbers, etc. Cass slips in a small mention of these and then very quickly moves onto the smooching.Also, America\u2019s family are supposed to be a hair\u2019s breadth away from poverty:\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t destitute. But I guess we weren\u2019t that far off either. Our caste was just three away from the bottom.\u201d\nAnd yet she has makeup products and:\n\u201cI had a few nicer dresses for when we worked, but they were hopelessly behind in the fashion department.\u201d\nBloody hell, is this really supposed to be a dystopia to anyone other than Paris Hilton? Oh no, I have only a few nice dresses, what is this world?!But America\u2019s shallow self-centredness extends beyond her obsession with dresses, makeup and denying her own beauty. She somehow manages to see herself as a voice of righteousness for the people and yet she doesn\u2019t even bother to learn the names of her maids at first. She has some notion (that I assume we\u2019re supposed to accept as well) that she\u2019s a really great person because she lowers herself to hang out with castes below her. Isn\u2019t she a sweetie for mingling with the commoners?The characters never develop beyond the most shallow archetypes - bitchy mean girls, \u201cnice\u201d best friend, banal love interest - all topped off with a Mary Sue protagonist. And Prince Maxon himself is about as sexy as a doorknob, with even fewer brain cells. How creepy is it that he says:\n\u201cYou are all dear to me. It is simply a matter of discovering who shall be the dearest.\u201d\nIs that meant to be cute? Because it isn\u2019t cute. It\u2019s weird.Just one more thing. I wasn't going to go into details about the world-building. To be honest, I went into The Selection willing to forgive it for not being very good on that front. I mean, it's obvious that this book wasn't written for people who care deeply about historical, political and socioeconomic factors. But Cass should have continued being vague, she really should have. Things just went even further downhill when she tried to paint in a back story.How did this world come about? Well, obviously there was a Third World War, duh. And if you had the most basic understanding of history, guess which countries might have invaded - yes, invaded, lol - the United States. China, you say? Bingo! Oh, and maybe the Russians? Yup, those too! I cringe just remembering it.Also, why would China invade the US? \n\"When the United States couldn't repay their massive debt, the Chinese invaded. Unfortunately for them, this didn't get them any money, as the United States was beyond bankruptcy.\"\nIs this for real?? Why would China be so stupid? Did they think they could just march in and seize the money the Americans wouldn't give them? And then when they don't get their money, they create \"The American State of China.\" Which then gets invaded by an expansionist Russia! This was way worse than if the author had simply offered no explanation for this society. It's a completely crazy explanation. Maybe Cass assumed her YA audience would be so history-dumb that it wouldn't matter if countries did stupid things for stupid reasons.I guess I learned my lesson about trying out those \"popular\" books I never read.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr | Youtube"}, {"userName": "Mariya", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2959426-mariya", "userReview": "\"I'm not so stupid as to believe that you've completely forgotten about your former boyfriend. I know you think there are others here more suited for me and this life, and I wouldn't want you to rush into trying to be happy with any of this. I just...I just want to know if it's possible...\"\n\nTHE SELECTION was one of the best books I have ever read! I don't think I quite expected that once I flipped the first page that I couldn't stop! But guess what it happened! I am constantly thinking about this book and I am 100% in \"WOW\" mode! Everything about this book I absolutely loved and I have no freaking clue how I am going to wait more than a year for the second book to come out. Such torture!THE SELECTION is a dystopian novel, but it didn't seem so much like one to me, more like a Cinderella story. But they have a caste system in this world that goes from one to eight. One being very rich and eight being very poor. The Selection gets held for the prince where out of 35 woman he gets to narrow it down to one girl he picks as his princess. So notices gets sent to all the girls to the age of 16 to 20 and all the girls go crazy submitting their entries for THE SELECTION.\n\nSince The Selection started, I'd been worrying that it was something that was going to ruin my life. But in this moment, I couldn't think of a time that felt more right.\n\nAs for America Singer our heroine of the story who is a five in the caste system, she doesn't want anything to do with THE SELECTION. Her mother is very needy and begging her because it is a wonderful opportunity. Even if you don't get chosen as the princess your life changes forever, you will be higher up in the caste system, and it would help America's family. America doesn't care about any of that though, and plus she has a secret boyfriend, Aspen. It is sort of forbidden too for her to be with him. Later on, Aspen feels America should at least try for The Selection and she gets picked as one of 35 girls. And some problems happen between Aspen and America before she leaves.\n\nHe leaned in even closer to whisper. \"You say you're here by mistake, so I'm assuming you don't want to be here.. Is there any possibility of you having any sort of...of loving feelings towards me?\"\n\nI liked America. I felt like she as a very strong heroine. And she is very unselfish. She is doing THE SELECTION for her family to help them, but also she wants some distance from Aspen. When we meet Prince Maxon he is everything America thought he wouldn't be. he is absolutely swoon worthy. I mean, come on. he is a prince. Maxon has very cute qualities that make my heart flutter. He has a cute reaction to crying ladies and it is funny. I love how he uses the term, \"my dear\", which America hates. Haha! Prince Maxon is very sweet and kind and all her wants is to find a girl among the 35 girls that are at his palace that he could love. That girl may end up to be America though. But the question becomes is America even interested? Is she over Aspen yet? There seems to be a lot going on between Maxon and America without anything actually happening and it becomes clear in my opinion at least that America does like Maxon, but there are things she has to figure out first.\n\nI wrapped my arms around him, resting my head against his chest. Maxon seemed both comforted and surprised by the gesture. I took only a second for him to wrap his arms securely around me. \"Maxon, I'm not completely sure what we are, but we're definitely more than friends.\"\n\nNo surprise that I like Maxon more than Aspen, but Aspen definitely has his moments and it makes you feel a little sorry for him. But I most definitely want America and Maxon together. THE SELECTION was one absolutely amazing and my only complaint would be why this book isn't longer. It felt so short. I wish the book was like 500 pages long. I loved it that much! It will be complete torture waiting for the next book in the series.More of my reviews at Mystifying Paranormal Reviews"}, {"userName": "Shannon", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2016128-shannon", "userReview": "If you can get past the \"I'm smelling my armpit\" cover, and also the silly names, and the horribly unoriginal storyline, and the terrible writing ... wait, really, you can get past all of that?

So please don't use them without asking my permission first. Thanks :)] \n35 GIRLS. 1 CROWN. THE COMPETITION OF A LIFETIME.\nNow with a story premise like that, honestly I thought it would take\u00a0a lot to ruin this book for me. 35 girls all competing for one crown and the heart of one handsome prince? Sign me up and bring on the popcorn! However, The Selection turned out to be one of those unfortunate books that had about twenty-dozen little things in it that just aggravated the crap out of me, with the end result being that I was entertained by it for all the wrong reasons.So first, a word about love triangles. I honestly don't mind them IF they are done well. But in this case, the love triangle was SO freaking forced, cliche, and angsty, I was ready to tear my hair out strand by strand. The whole thing between America, Aspen, and Maxon was just completely ridiculous (ALMOST as ridiculous as those names), and the motivations behind their actions made absolutely no sense whatsoever. There were so many instances of juvenile misunderstanding, miscommunication, etc. that I'm not even\u00a0going to\u00a0bother going into specifics. All I have to say is: STOP TRYING TO MAKE THE LOVE TRIANGLE HAPPEN.\n\n\nMoving on, America as a main character was just about two steps away from being completely intolerable. She was-- to put it simply-- extremely annoying (Highlight, underline, and bold extremely). I *might* have been able to stand her if all the little things that were supposed to make her seem like a fun and feisty redhead hadn't come across as painfully redundant and irritating (Oh and by the way- I'm a genuine redhead, so I can tell you right now, we don't act like America Singer). So yeah, by the end, I was pretty much incredibly offended that my redheaded-ness was portrayed in such a pathetic and crappy light. For example, she denies ad nauseum that she's beautiful even though she clearly is. (Please note, America: False modesty does not make you more attractive-- it makes people want to punch you in the face.) She makes constant quips and remarks about the stuffy life that Maxon leads and he finds it to be cute (it's not). She's got the whole cliche tom-boy thing going on while every other girl is a Stepford clone-- It was just like, OK, I get it, she's one of those totally-gorgeous-but-she's-the-only-one-who-thinks-she's-not girls. And ironically? She stands out in the story because she's so \"different\" from the other girls, while simultaneously being about as cliche as they come.\n\n\nAs for the rest of the girls in the book? Well, let's just say that added to the exasperating America Singer, this book just made me hate girls. For real. Even more than ANTM.And the guys weren't any better. Probably because they were about as manly as:\n\n\nSexy, amirite?Prince Maxon was seriously one of the most awkward characters I've ever encountered-- and not in that adorable, hott kind of way either. In typical Disney prince fashion, he was so perfect and nice that I couldn't even take him seriously. He bored me to tears and was overly-sheltered to the point of being pathetic. And his behavior? It made NO SENSE. Let's review: America wrongly assumes that Maxon is about to rape her-- then she proceeds to knee him in the royal jewels-- then he pretty much brushes it off like a day later and goes back to let's-be-best-friends-because-I-don't-have-any mode. Seriously dude? I've never watched The Bachelor, but I'm thinking that if some strange girl told the guy that she had zero interest in him, that she was in love with somebody else, that she was only there for the food (no I'm not making this up) AND THEN wrongly accused him of being a rapist, I'm going to take a **wild guess** that he would've kicked her out of the mansion on the spot. I mean, that's a pretty serious way to offend someone, no?\n\n\nBut then when America tries to explain to him that Celeste the Biotch is\u00a0sabotaging\u00a0the rest of the girls, he throws a hissy fit being all like, \"YOU WILL RESPECT MAH AUTHORATAH!\" -- and almost sends her home. Whhhhhaaaatttt???However, Prince Maxon wasn't nearly as douche-baggy as Aspen, the chauvinistic jerk-wad who gets his panties all in a bunch when America tries to make him dinner and then immediately bails on her because he can't handle the helpless, little woman being the one providing for him. This guy seriously needed to grow a pair.Another beef I had with this book was that I couldn't find any context for the kind of society that America Singer lives in. HOW did Illea come to be the way it is? What major events led up to the creation of a society where there's a monarchy, an eight-tiered caste system, and two different groups of rebel forces trying to bring it down? And why again was The Selection created?? (Vague explanation: it creates hope. okaaayyyy...) And don't even get me started on \"The History Lesson\" that was randomly thrown in, because it made absolutely NO SENSE (The American State of China? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA). Apparently there was a Third and Fourth World War where the US was invaded by China and then Russia because it couldn't pay off its massive debt. Riiiiiiiiiiight... Explain that one to me, please-- last time I checked, major international superpowers don't behave like 4th graders trying to steal someone's lunch money by giving them a massive wedgie. So, in a nutshell, the \"history lesson\" that attempted to establish the world of Illea explained nothing.\n\n\nSo for me, it was difficult to find a connection to this world because it wasn't built on any solid foundation that would have made it remotely believable. And I'm sorry, but if a book can't manage to adequately explain how a society came to be and what the motivation is behind the ones leading it or trying to tear it down (**cough, cough** Matched! **cough, cough**), that for me is a major dystopian FAIL. In the end, I just had to take Illea for what it was-- a make-believe fairy-tale kind of setting that had no\u00a0plausible\u00a0explanation for why it exists or how it came to be.Now if the long-awaited, delicious drama of a 35-girl competition had actually happened, I really wouldn't have cared about the absence of a thought-provoking dystopia. But where the heck was the crazy competition part of the story?? That whole Bachelor spin-off was the number one reason I was looking forward to reading this book in the first place! And the entire thing ended up being one big snoozefest. There were some random acts of cattiness and backstabbing, a few girls got kicked off, a few dresses got ruined, but hardly anything was explained and there was little to no build-up. What happened to--\n\n\nNot only was there no drama, but I honestly couldn't have cared less about who got kicked off and who stayed. Note to the author: If you aren't going to even bother telling your readers WHO your characters are, WE AREN'T GOING TO GIVE A CRAP WHEN THEY GET BUMPED OFF. We have ZERO investment in them. So faceless, never-before-mentioned Girls #1, 2 and 3 got the ax? Umm, yeah don't care. No shock value. And Celeste the spoiled little rich girl? C'mon now, she was one big glaring stereotype and had about as much personality as a thumbtack. It was boring!!\u00a0And one of the girls was named Tiny. I'm sorry, but how can I take a book seriously with character names like Tiny, Tuesday, King Clarkson, and Maxon Schreave? (Answer: I can't.) And when the only thing in your dystopia that comes across as being even slightly disturbing is the prospect that one day we will be moronic enough to name our kids \"Tiny\" and \"America,\" well, you've messed up something pretty badly. Just sayin'.So for me, the only thing that this book had going for it was that it was *mildly* entertaining in a mindless kind of way, and there was nothing about it that made me want to seriously punch a hole in the wall. But the rest was either very confusing or highly predictable. Everything from the characters, to the love triangle, to most of the outcomes of The Selection were all very easy to see coming from miles away. I'm sorry, but I really couldn't find anything about this book that was terribly exceptional or interesting and overall, I just wasn't impressed.After this, I think I'll be picking up a book about killer dragons. Or bioengineered war beasts. That really sounds like a good idea right about now...~Lea @  LC's Adventures in Libraryland"}, {"userName": "Steph Sinclair", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4642710-steph-sinclair", "userReview": "I read this book for one reason: To find out why it's a New York Times Best-selling series. After drinking several beers and banging my head against the wall after reading The Selection, I can kinda see why. And to be fair, it's probably not the absolute worst book I've read. (I mean, there's still that time I read Starcrossed by Josephine Angelini...) Still, it is by no means something that I'd recommend.I know it might seem like I detested The Selection based on my status updates, but to be perfectly honest, I haven't had this much fun reading a terrible book since \nMidnight Sun\n.Reasons Why This Book is Made of LOLZ:Character names: If there's one thing that I just don't understand about The Selection, it's why more creativity couldn't be used on character names. Really, I'm not asking for much here, but America SINGER? Character names based on their occupation? WHY? What's funny is when other characters ask America what she does for a living because THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT COULD POSSIBLY BE.House of Mary Sues: It might not surprise you that this book is about a super special snowflake, but did you know that virtually ALL the characters are just as special? The competition in The Selection isn't just about which girl can win Maxon's heart. Oh no. It's about who's the most special of them all! And since most of them are so damn selfless, they end up tripping over themselves, giving each other compliment after compliment. (\"No, you're the prettiest! You'd make such a great Queen. I'm nothing but a cardboard cutout excuse for a supporting character.\" *giggle*) I shit you not. In fact, even Maxon and Aspen are competing, too. In my hands I hold a royal flush of Mary Sues.The love triangle: I almost always dislike love triangles. It turns the female character into someone who can only focus on the two boys and becomes a much less interesting person. Her entire story revolves around the boys and which one is the \"most perfect\"\u00a0for her. In effect, she is defined by this love triangle and her story becomes a shipping war.I was hoping The Selection wouldn't fall into that trap and was ecstatic that America was leaving Aspen behind when she left to live at the palace. But I knew things couldn't be that simple since he eventually shows up at the right fucking moment to add unnecessary romantic tension. Because what a coincidence that a poor boy, who's a glorified custodian, would find his way all the way to the palace and a guard right outside America's door! WOW! It must be fate... or perhaps bad writing. Let's go with the latter.So now we have both boys back into America's life. What's a 16-year-old to do? Who are you going to choose, America?!\"No, I'm not choosing him or you. I'm choosing me.\"Bullshit. America spends majority of the book struggling with who to choose. And I would wager that the other books have the very same struggle. If there is one thing this book was good at, it was its predictability.Also, did I mention how America has never had a female friend? The explanation for this is that she is always working and was homeschooled. But someone she made time to have a steady boyfriend (Aspen) for 2 years. She even mentions his sisters, but apparently, they aren't friends. Even more, I found it super strange that she mentions that Maxon would have been someone she befriended at home had he been a neighbor. So I guess America only had time to make male friends back at home. It's after she is forced to be around other females that she makes female friends.The thing about her female friends is that the only thing they ever talk about is Maxon. Though he is a supporting character to America, he holds the center of this novel, making it complete one-dimensional, lacking any character depth. It's a real shame because the premise of The Selection isn't entirely a horrible one. But instead, Cass sets up a plot that is so staged that I couldn't possibly take it seriously. Supporting characters are weaker to make America seem stronger. Supporting character make ridiculous suggestions so America can seem smarter. Rebels attack the palace for... reasons not expanded on because it has nothing to do with the romance. But, hey, those scenes make America look like a leader, so why not?(What really kills me is how America tells Maxon that she \"just needs time\" to get over her ex-boyfriend, but he has no idea it's Aspen, the very guard he stationed right outside her bedroom at night. And she doesn't seem to have any inclination to tell Maxon either. Also, Maxon doesn't own a set of balls.)Like I said earlier, I can sort of see the appeal of this book and I've been told it's really popular among younger readers. Two hot boys, pretty dresses, a light and fluffy read. There is nothing wrong with these things. I occasionally like them in my books as well, depending on what kind of mood I'm in. But I would have liked the novel to be about more than just a girl choosing between each guy. We know nothing about her beaus outside of how \"cute\" they are to America. What are their traits, strengths, morals? How do they individually enhance America's life? What do these male characters represent on a larger scale? How do they even differ?The Selection doesn't even begin to touch on any of those questions because the story doesn't actually leave you with any to ponder. What it does leave you with is a promise of a love triangle from hell and a sinking sense that the remainder of the series could only be one thing: a waste of time. My paperback came with a sneak peek of book 2 and I was very underwhelmed even more than I was with The Selection. She starts off book 2 with the difficult choice of Maxon or Aspen. I think I will spare myself.So the question is: Is this book worth a read? In my opinion, no. Alternately, there's \nThe Jewel\n that has a very similar feel, but is an overall stronger novel in every possible way. Read that instead.Steph... out!More reviews and other fantastical things at Cuddlebuggery."}, {"userName": "Emily Blake", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5242354-emily-blake", "userReview": "*An ARC was provided by HarperTeen in exchange for an honest review*I don't usually go for books like this one, with the whole princess competition thing going on (actually I've never even started one because they don't look good), but let me tell you, this book is amazing.I loved it. That's all I can say. It went right into the story, and I was hooked from page one. I just couldn't stop reading. The plot was AMAZING!! I loved how Kiera Cass manipulated the characters (Aspen) to make America sign up, and then dropped him, but still kept him around. Does that make any sense to you? I probably didn't explain that right, but I did my best. :DAbout half-way through the book I stopped and looked at all the pages I had left to read and there were still like twenty girls left and I was like HOW IS SOMEONE GOING TO WIN WHEN THERE'S ONLY FIFTY PAGES LEFT? Well, when I finished, my question was answered: None did. Kiera Cass decided to put me through the torture of the biggest cliffhanger ever and not tell me who won. HOW COULD YOU DO THAT TO ME?!?!From page one America was in an interesting situation, what with getting Selected and having Aspen as a boyfriend. This book wouldn't have been anywhere near as good as it is if it didn't have the love triangle. I usually don't like books with it in them, but it totally worked for this one.I love Maxon. He is totally misunderstood. He isn't stiff, aloof, mean. He's actually really sweet and CUTE.The other side of the triangle is Aspen. I don't like him. The little slime-ball dumped America because she gave him some food then had the gal to come crying back to her. I hope she ends up with Maxon.And, last but not least, I really liked America. The whole theme with her in the Selection was that she wanted to be herself, not someone fake, and I really like that. She's a very strong character and speaks her mind. Sort of like me. :PAll in all, I BETTER GET THE SECOND BOOK ASAP OR I WILL EXPLODE!!

I was originally looking for a book for a reading challenge (needed blue covers) and just happened to see this at the library and figured it didn't look too bad and that I would just read it since nothing else was working. I have now read this three times since it came out. It has yet to tire for me.It is hard to explain why I like it. It is a true guilty pleasure, fluffy kind or read with a hint of action and intrigue for future books in the series.I will admit, the concepts are not very original. The ideas that is is in between The Bachelor and Hunger Games (in the dystopia sense)is fairly accurate, with heavily leanings on The Bachelor. The love triangle setting adds a bit extra to character complexity.I will not say much on what the books is about. The summary already does that in itself on this book. The book is written from America's perspective and what I will say otherwise is what I thought. First, I must admit, I dislike the character names. Yes I know the last names refer to what the person does, but the first names are horrid in my opinion. Yet the main thing is the writing style and pace. I literally laid down last night thinking I would read a few chapters. Next thing I knew, the sun would be rising soon and the book sat finished in my hands. I don't get that with many books anymore. This book made me giggle at times, and twitch in anticipation at others. It left me desperately craving the sequel. Wondering who she picks, or who Maxon picks,what is up with the other girls, etc.So, while the concept is not original, the characters are interesting, and the story is written in a way that is easy to get wrapped up in it. I actually just put it back on hold at the library so I could skim through it once again before them next book comes out. I read it so fast I fear I might have missed things. I honestly had a hard time rating this. In the way in captured my attention once I started reading, and my desire to read it again I would normally say 5, but since it does lean SO heavily on the concept of The Bachelor. So, I give this a 4 1/2."}, {"userName": "Gabrielle Carolina", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3755332-gabrielle-carolina", "userReview": "Did not finish; stopped at page 208.I could not get behind America who is suffering from an affliction called TSTL syndrome (too stupid to live.)

Besides that, and a serious lack of world building, The Selection is to The Hunger Games as Carrier of the Mark is to Twilight. That is to say an apparent knock-off. Gavril and Caesar are the same personality to a T.

But, I can't help it, I just enjoy them so much. The Selection is a bit like that. It's cheap, nasty and has everything I could possibly hate in literature, yet I found myself addicted and it was so much fun.(I still stand by my opinion that the controversy surrounding this a few years ago as a result of a couple of individuals was weak and really fucking poor on their behalf)Aside from my disgust at certain people involved, this book was so fluffy and fun to read. The first 100 pages were an absolute drag, but after the initial slog, I couldn't put it down at all and just enjoyed the ride, although it's not without flaws.As I expected, the characterization in The Selection was weak. America Singer (I will never get used to that name - ever.) is portrayed as compassionate, down to earth and is generally pretty likable. However, she's also kind of a special snowflake... She is portrayed as better than the other girls because she goes \"light on the makeup\" and likes to wear jeans instead of dresses. America is also constantly told how pretty/beautiful she is, and you guessed it - doesn't believe it! WOW! What a surprise!!! The way America is written as a special snowflake would normally annoy the ever loving fuck out of me, but I actually really enjoyed her as a character and loved her banter, wit and her overall personality.The other girls in the competition are portrayed as vapid, shallow bitches and America calls them \"fake\" etc. Essentially, this is just another tool used to make America stand out as a special snowflake among a sea of other women. They don't have a lot of personality as it's clear the reader is supposed to hate other characters, particularly Celeste, because they're the stereotypical nasty, pretty girl in a YA novel.The worldbuilding isn't that great either, in fact it's pretty shit. All of the world building and history is given to the reader in the form of \"History lessons\" in classes at the castle which are really just a disguise for lots of gigantic infodumps in which we may as well be given a page of dot points instead of it being mushed together with dialogue. The actual caste system itself is sketchy and disorganised, and I still don't understand why we're meant to feel sorry for America and her family for being Fives. Oh, you're middle class musicians and can \"only\" afford to eat pasta and chicken for dinner and can \"only\" afford the bare minimum of makeup? Please.The writing is unremarkable, and at times just straight up bad. The dialogue is stilted and at times cringey, but I suppose it was easy to read.Also, let's get one thing straight. While this book is marketed as a dystopia, it should not be considered a dystopia at all. The competition in which the girls do not have to participate in (sure, there is monetary gain for the families, but they're not exactly being forced against their will), has no negative outcomes, in fact the outcomes of losing the competition are still pretty positive. As I said before, the caste system is sketchy and the only thing that could possibly point to this being a dystopia is the poverty, which even then, is not explored in enough depth to even be considered a huge deal compared to the extravagant risk-free competition to win the heart of the hot, kind, caring Prince Maxon. Oh wait, there is also a minor threat of rebels who attack the castle every now and again, but they're kind of just a tacked on thing to add a little bit of drama that isn't fuelled by the bitchiness of the competition. This is not a dystopia. This is pure fluff, but that's okay and I love it. (Just don't fucking call something like this a dystopia, please - there is no social commentary in this, when there was so much opportunity for it and dystopia is typically used as a platform to discuss serious world issues).This could have been so much more than it was, however I can't deny that I had fun reading it.

Last time I checked it was in the 3's. Something fishy is going on here... This review also appears on The Dreaming Reader.May I present to everyone The Hunger Games...Girlified!Disclaimer: Despite the fact that I am drawing comparisons between the two, there is no way that this sad little novel (if it can even be called that) will ever match up to The Hunger Games.Similarity #1: A \"cutthroat\" competition in which only one winner will be left standing. Why It's Girlified: Instead of engaging in bloody struggles to the death, the girls instead compete by wearing prettier dresses, better makeup, and having etiquette. The closest they get to violence is when one bitch-slaps the other (which lasted one sentence). Then, I guess they just gossip each other to the death. Similarity #2: A poor heroine who seems like an unfeeling douche in the beginning but somehow manages to endear herself to the public with her antics. Why It's Girlified: America Singer (this name. I can't even.) is the most self-centered, weepy little twit I've ever read about. She does multiple things that would be considered horrible if others had done them, such as badmouthing the prince and throwing tantrums, but somehow the prince loves her and even wants to be her best friend, (because he's as stupid as she is, probably), and the public adores her. This quote basically sum up her dazzling personality: His black T-shirt was worn to threads in several places, just like the shabby pair of jeans he wore almost every day. If only I could sit and patch them up for him. That was my great ambition.First selling off virginity, then this. This book is doing leaps and bounds for femininity, let me tell ya. Similarity #3: The love triangle between the boy back home and the new boy whose personality the MC comes to know and adore. Why It's Girlified: I can't make a decision between Aspen and Maxon. Why? Because I would rather make no decision at all. Neither of them have desirable qualities besides their broad shoulders and strong fingers. Cass needs to learn that just because the guys are hot doesn't mean they won't act like sticks of wood. We have Aspen: He ripped back my blankets in a move both graceful and violent.I was internally screaming RAPE at this part. Love of my life or no, I don't want him ripping my sheets off me after I hesitated over answering whether or not I loved someone else. We have Maxon: He had his own smell, a mix of chemicals that burned out from him.Do any of you find the fact that Maxon is toxic attractive? Because I don't. Basically, what I'm saying is that this book has obvious aspects that come from The Hunger Games. However, it is also so girlified, teenybopperified, and altogether stupidified that these features have become almost unrecognizable. The writing is clumsy. It goes sort of like this: Yesterday I brushed my teeth. I looked out my window and saw my boyfriend with his arms around another girl. Tears welled in my eyes. I smiled. I smiled again. I whisper-yelled at him. It took a while for me to rest, since I was so tired. It's so painfully elementary that I wanted to slam my head against a tile. Anyway. Please don't be like me, in that others' countless negative reviews weren't enough to convince you this book is utter crap. Because it is. Even the ending is crap. I might have been a bit more lenient if Cass had finished what she'd started this book for. I don't even get what the conflict was. And there was no anticlimactic finale. There was no climax AT ALL. The plot is just a straight, boring line to nowhere. There were some iffy mentions of rebels and America's doubts about Ill\u00e9a (doesn't make any sense to me why that makes this a dystopian, but whatever), but that's all overshadowed by the pressing concern of getting the attentions of some prince who doesn't know jack about his own country but still manages to make spur-of-the-moment, groundbreaking decisions. Oh, and he claims to know nothing about girls and to be afraid of their crying, but he manages to say all the right things and bring them all into giggly puddles of goo? This is disgusting and unflattering. I'm sure I speak for most women when I say that not all of us are reduced into pathetic tear-streaked damsels because of some guy. I tried to read this like a chick lit. I did. But I doubt even my swoony, easily convinced self would've liked this sappy bundle of badly written cliche. My computer accidentally erased my previous review, which was already 3/4 written, which makes me hate this book even more."}, {"userName": "Natalie Monroe", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6688207-natalie-monroe", "userReview": "1.5 stars\n\"I didn't want to be royalty. And I didn't want to be a One. I didn't even want to try.\"\nLet me tell you a story. Once upon a time, a girl who doesn't think she's pretty and has jackshit ambition is suddenly elevated to a Chosen One status. She gets to live a palace where she's waited on hand and foot as well as gets a makeover and pretty dresses. During her time, she slowly finds herself falling for a handsome boy in a position of power, but her heart is still with her scruffy low-class boyfriend back home. Just when she's resigned herself to the knowledge that she'll never see him again, he suddenly crashes back into her shiny new life due military reasons. She finds herself torn between the two boys, torn between her old life and her new. Sound familiar? Yup, it's Shadow and Bone.To be fair, the whole rags-to-special-snowflake plot is commonplace in literature. But whereas Shadow and Bone had creative fantasy elements and the ending going for it, The Selection has precious few redeeming qualifies. Our protagonist America Singer is dull, bordering on unbearable. Looking past the fact that she's named after her career like a Smurf, she's your typical YA heroine who doesn't think she's pretty (even though she totes is) and doesn't want to be special (even though she totes is). I never got over the way she body-shamed her mother:\n\"For a Five, she was a little on the heavy side, which was odd. She wasn't a glutton, and it's not like we had anything to overeat anyways. Perhaps that's just the way a body looks after five children.\"\nSomeone pointed out to me this passage was supposed to illustrate the caste system and how the lower classes are always hungry, thus, thin. If it is though, it's a piss-poor way of showing it. What about something like, \"The weight of birthing five children had taken a toll on my mother. She was heavier than most members in our caste, who looked perpetually starved from inadequate food.\" It invites us to sympathize with America's mother while communicating the caste issue. The writing's largely to blame because it's shit. It's not awful, but it's too far from the neutral line to praise. Too many sentences start with \"I\", and it's overly simplistic and dotted with tells instead of shows (i.e. I knew she felt embarrassed for me, I knew she was sad, etc).While there's thankfully less girl-hating than I expected, the Selection still features the typical Mean Popular Girl and has unnecessary commentary on cleavage and too much makeup. It emphasizes the \"natural\" look, which, when put together with the slut-shaming, inclines towards exclusion rather than celebration of self-love. America's belief in a support system among her female competitors as opposed to war is a stroke of feminism I didn't anticipate, but it's overshadowed by the book's lack of other prominent female characters. When you really think about it, it's just another way to show off how sweet and special she is.And I never thought I'd encounter a literary love interest I hated more than Jeb from Splintered, but here he is in all his \"me man, you woman\" caveman glory. Aspen is a flaming dickwad and can fall into a volcano for all I care. He literally says a man's job is to provide and then blows up at America because she dared to do something nice for him using her own earnings. There's also the whole leery domestic framework surrounding their relationship, like how she's the good wife in the kitchen and he's the breadwinner going out to bring home the bacon. Because The Selection was published during YA's dystopian wave, it has to be a dystopian, with rebels and poverty and class differences. Aspen is basically Gale 2.0, the oldest and caretaker of his family. Yet it's heavily romance-focused.I personally think the series would have worked better in a fantasy setting. To quote another review, dystopian is a genre that doesn't need to be fluffed up. The rebels have no impact on the plot at all. They pop up every now and then to remind readers that they exist, add some pointless tension, and then scuttle off without doing any real damage. The Hunger Games has its own \"Selection\" storyline, but managed to convey a thoughtful message on celebrity culture. The Selection has no such nuance. World-building is non-existent, so maybe it wouldn't be a good idea to make The Selection a fantasy novel. In the end, Gale 2.0 promises to fight harder for America (through very cheesy dialogue), hence, setting up the angsty love triangle in The Elite. Ultimately, The Selection is like reality TV. Inane, gossipy, and profoundly pointless.

BECAUSE I NEED TO CATCH UP. I CAN\u2019T LOSE. NOT AT A READING THING. THIS IS ALL I HAVE!!!!Two of the adjectives I would have used were semi-accurate.Hint: They\u2019re not the genuinely complimentary ones.I had two major problems with this book that just would not, could not go away. Would not, could not write people as gay. (I\u2019m trying out a new thing where I\u2019m like the Dr. Seuss of negative reviews. Except did you guys know that he cheated on his wife who had cancer and she committed suicide when she found out? Not all Mr. Nice Fox in Socks.)I guess I actually had three major problems with this. No, four!One, there is straight up no diversity. (I\u2019m not someone who just gives a book one star for being totally un-diverse, but this book is startlingly straight and white. And I also I have three whole other problems.) I believe there are two Asian characters, one of whom is named Tiny Lee - so just make up your own minds on that. But other than that, this is just a bunch o\u2019 straight white girls looking for love. And I think it woulda livened up the plot a little to have at least one gay girl.And the plot, I\u2019m sorry, but it could use some livenin\u2019 up.Two, I LITERALLY HATE LOVE TRIANGLES. Granted, this was published five years ago, and love triangles were essentially a prerequisite for young-adult categorization, BUT STILL. Love triangles are so unrealistic and boring and uncomfy. The Big Three of me hating something.Three, our main character, America, is The Best and So Quirky and The Chosen One and so totally...dare I say it...I must: not like other girls.(Horrified gasp from the crowd at this surprise appearance from the world\u2019s worst trope.)I\u2019ll just list out the examples I scribbled down, k?AMERICA, THE GIRL-HATING SPECIAL SNOWFLAKE- \u201cLots of the other girls looked a little older or younger or just nicer after the makeup. I still looked like me when I was done. Of course, so did Celeste, since she insisted upon piling it on.\u201d- \u201cBariel was beautiful, but in a typical way. It was similar to Celeste\u2019s style.\u201d Unfortunately we can\u2019t all be not like other girls, America! It\u2019s against the very nature of the term.- \u201cI had probably chosen my plainest dress for the first day, and everyone else\u2019s had something sparkly on it.\u201d- even though this takes place in a prim-and-proper dystopian United States, America is told that if Maxon (the prince) asks to screw her, she has to say yes. She later freaks out at Maxon about this, and when she\u2019s explaining what happened, Maxon is horrified and asks, \u201cWas everyone told this?\u201d America\u2019s gorgeous and tactful response: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t imagine many girls would need such a warning. They\u2019re probably waiting to pounce on you.\u201d SOMEONE PLEASE JUST MURDER ME. JUST TAKE ME OUT OF THIS MISERY.- this whole book is also just that really annoying trope of when the girl ~doesn\u2019t know she\u2019s beautiful~ (RIP One Direction) and is totally oblivious to the way The Guy sees her and also everyone else and in order to keep that going the girl has to blatantly and impossibly misinterpret compliments- one example of that: when Maxon tells America his mom loves her, she\u2019s like, \u201comg now even his MOM thinks i\u2019m totally weird and crazy oh man!!!!\u201d WHICH HOW DO YOU GET THAT FROM AN OBVIOUS COMPLIMENTBut numba four practically defines this book for me. THERE IS SO MUCH GIRL-ON-GIRL HATE IN THIS, AND SO MUCH SEXISM.Let\u2019s do another list. I love a list.OR LET\u2019S JUST STRAIGHT UP HATE WOMEN- the entire EXISTENCE of the Celeste character, as a mean girl/the sole villain, is so trope-y and girl-hate-y and boring- it\u2019s twice stated that the role of a guy in a relationship is to protect and provide for the female- there\u2019s a Gale in this love triangle, the hometown crush and underdog, and a Peeta, the fame-associated hottie. The Gale (Aspen) gets so mad at America for giving him food that he breaks up with her; America instructs the Peeta (Maxon) on how to contemplate the burden of having to provide for a wife-\u201cGirls like that? They\u2019ll take themselves out of the competition.\u201d Again, I cannot stress this enough to you guys - girls come in kinds. There are eight simple types, now available for men to order in one easy step!- \u201cYou haven\u2019t spent a whole lot of time with groups of girls, have you? [...] they each have their ways of getting under other people\u2019s skin. [...] Lots of girls give me backhanded compliments, or little remarks, things like that.\u201d Ah yes, I nearly forgot that it is the vocation of every female ever to be totally mean to every other female just for the hell of it.- This may be personal preference, but I just hate that trope of \u201comg what do u do with a crying female!!! So confusing!!! What do they want!!! Why are they crying!!! Ugh how do we decode them women!!!\u201d There\u2019s also just so many little dumb things. How\u2019s about another list?! A classic one!!GENERAL STUPIDITY- So the girls wear nametags at the beginning of the Selection. And when it\u2019s time for bed on the first night, THEY PUT THE METAL NAMETAG PIN ON HER NIGHTGOWN. WHY WOULD SHE NEED IT. WHY WOULD SHE SLEEP IN A NAMETAG. I AM SILENTLY SCREAMING INTO THE ABYSS. (But how goddamn convenient that she happens to coincidentally meet Maxon that night when she\u2019s supposed to be asleep.)- While America\u2019s waiting an unknown amount of time in her room for Maxon to show up, she says she doesn\u2019t want to start a book only to stop, or play piano only to stop. So maybe we should just never do anything for fear of being interrupted.- (I know that last one was particularly meaningless, but so much of this book rings unnatural and weird because of tiny stuff like that AND IT\u2019S DRIVING ME BONKERS.)- The quasi-history that brought us from current-day to the dystopian future this book takes place in just bugged me so muchAll that being said...These books are so fast to read and I have weekend plans and my new job starts on Monday so I really can\u2019t just sit down and knock out just any 3 books.So I\u2019ll probably be picking up the next book as soon as possible.Hopefully it\u2019s better? (Did this come off as uncertain as it feels?)Maybe The One will be good.

On the one hand, I'm imagining a real life caste system, but then you hear of a five and a six watching frakking television and having enough money for popcorn, at the end of the day. And even the eights seem to find a way to live and not be considered complete untouchables.

A man of the name Gregory Ill\u00e9a pulled together what was left to form Ill\u00e9a. This new country came with a strict caste system with Ones being the royal family all the way down to Eights - poor, starving untouchables.America Singer, a Five, is among the artist caste. Hungry but not starving. Poor but not destitute. She has a secret love, Aspen, a Six (the laborers and cleaners) and she knows nothing could be worse than their discovery.

I'll be lucky if I can just find someone who'll be able to stand me for the rest of our lives. What if I've already sent her home because I was relying on some sort of spark I didn't feel? What if she's waiting to leave me at the first sign of adversity? What if I don't find anyone at all? What do I do then, America?\u201d\n\nThis novel is like a dating version of the hunger games, and we're here discussing soulmates??Then there's this beauty of a quote about fucking calluses. Yes, you heard me, this lengthy quote is about calluses:\n\n\u201cWhat are these?\" Maxon asked, brushing across the tips of my fingers as we walked.\"Calluses. They're from pressing down on violin strings four hours a day.\"\"I've never noticed them before.\"\"Do they bother you?\" I was the lowest caste of the six girls left, and I doubted any of them had hands like mine.Maxon stopped moving and lifted my fingers to his lips, kissing the tiny, worn tips.\"On the contrary. I find them rather beautiful.\" I felt myself blush. \"I've seen the world \u2013 admittedly mostly through bulletproof glass or from the tower of some ancient castle \u2013 but I've seen it. And I have access to the answers of a thousand questions at my disposal. But this small hand here?\" He looked deeply into my eyes. \"This hand makes sounds incomparable to anything I've ever heard. Sometimes I think I only dreamed that I heard you play the violin, it was so beautiful. These calluses are proof that it was real.\u201d\n\nWhat are we going to romanticize next? Toes? Ears? ...Wait, I think that's already been done...Then there was the time that Maxon was obviously high when he wrote America this love letter: \n\n\"I also miss your smell. I miss your perfume drifting off your hair when you turn to laugh at me or your scent radiating on your skin when we walk through the garden. It's intoxicating.So I went to your room to spray your perfume on my handkerchief, another silly little trick to make me feel like you were here. And as I was leaving your room, Mary caught me. I'm not sure what she was looking after since you're not here; but she saw me, shrieked, and a guard came running in to see what was wrong. He had his staff gripped, and his eyes flashed threateningly. I was nearly attacked. All because I missed your smell.\u201d\n\nI don't know guys, I find that really creepy and weird for a matter of fact. Just imagine, walking into your room to some guy spraying your perfume on his handkerchief.For some reason that reminded me of this:Mmm, who doesn't like smelling like a colon...If you haven't realized what's wrong with that sentence, then I don't know what to tell you... I swear to God, this next quote is like the Adele song of books:\n\n\u201cI'll love you until my very last breath. Every beat of my heart is yours. I don't want to die without you knowing that.\u201d\n\nThat is quite literally what this phrase feels like.I've even seen vampire novels using this quote, which is a huge plot hole, because they aren't even alive.I love how this novel can still be making a jab at art majors, since they're one of the bottom ranking ones here. When you think of it that way, the torment never escapes you(not an art major personally). \nYou know when you're trying to make up a fake name and you either go by random objects around you, or you just say:\nWell, if only our MC had an original name like Jeff. Instead she's an American singer, named... America Singer.Thank God my parents didn't use those naming methods, I don't know how I'd last if everyone called me Canada Reader or Umbilical cord Doorknob.

Had i read this two or three years ago when I was neck deep in the my love for predictable happily ever afters, I would have been head over heels for this book. But sadly that isn't case now. The book was well written and with a melodic drift that made you want to find out what happens next, even though you kinda already knew what's going to happen since the first page. In a simply mediocre kind of way. But all in all I can't really complain, it's not something I would read again, but I did enjoy it enough to want to read the rest of the series. But then again that is debatable, given my limited time to read, and the frankly averageness of this book. The main character albeit, as previously mentioned, being predictable was quite interesting. She has a kindred spark to her spirit that always attracts me like a moth to a flame. And although I'm not particularly a fan of love triangles, this one started of from the beginning as a trio conflict. That I admit was also a source of attraction to me. The ending kind of put me out, because let's face it, boys and their egos don't allow for honest admission of mistakes and then the pledge to continue fighting for a girl that admits she might have feelings for someone else, no boy is that mature. (No offense to the male gender itself, but reality isn't so perfect). And just to be clear, I do not, in any way approve of violence.

The idea being that Prince Charming comes from a little country you\u2019ve never heard of and woos you with his eloquent parlance, snappy dress sense, and amiable personality. He might also be cursed and looking for the kiss of true love.\u00a0Still, cursed or not, Prince Charming archetypes have existed for as long as fairytales and Disney movies have perpetuated. It also seems that a lot of girls don\u2019t really grow out of wanting their own gorgeous foreign prince to carry them off in a flurry of rose-petals and heavily-accented sweet nothings whispered into their ears. How else do you explain the success of film and book series like\u00a0The Prince and Me\u00a0and\u00a0The Princess Diaries?\u00a0Now this tried and tested formula is going to dip its toe into YA\u2019s current darling \u2013 a dystopian world where our heroine does not have the freedom to love who she chooses. (Basically 90% of Disney movies, where our heroine learns she should\u00a0marry for love\u00a0and not for money or prestige.) Then add in a pinch of horrendous reality TV like\u00a0America\u2019s Next Top Model, and you\u2019ve got\u00a0The Selection\u00a0by Kiera Cass. This should truly be a match made in heaven, right?Wrong.\u00a0For a dystopian novel to work, its society has to be completely horrible. Going with the classics,\u00a01984\u2018s Airstrip One has the thought police and the threat of going into Room 101. There\u2019s also the stifling World State in\u00a0Brave New World, and the ultra conservative Republic of Gilead in\u00a0The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u00a0With YA dystopian novels, we have the authorities in\u00a0The Hunger Games\u00a0punishing political dissenters by cutting out their tongues and forcing them into slavery. And in\u00a0Delirium\u00a0by Lauren Oliver, those whose actions go against the status quo are taken off to be imprisoned and \u2018corrected\u2019, and are then erased from society proper.\u00a0Those are just some examples off the top of my head, and generally my personal benchmarks for dystopian novels, be they YA, fantasy, science fiction, classic literature, whatever.\u00a0So why do I feel that the setting of this novel should have just been a fantasy kingdom with a modern twist, rather than a dystopia? The dystopian elements are so sparsely mentioned that it feels like the author only added them in to appeal to the\u00a0Hunger Games\u00a0crowd.\u00a0Society in Ill\u00e9a works like this. The United States is now a monarchy, and it has a very rigid caste system in place. Your caste number goes from One (extremely wealthy and aristocratic) to Eight (living in extreme poverty, and working menial jobs).\u00a0Our main heroine, America Singer (who just so happens to have great vocal talent\u2026 *rolls eyes*) lives in a family ranked Five. Her boyfriend Aspen\u2019s family are Sixes, and generally quite disadvantaged compared to America\u2019s family. But who cares about that when Aspen is the kind of guy who\u2019ll arrange romantic trysts in the tree-house, lay his head on your lap while you sing to him, and let you feed him your leftovers, like some big adorable puppy.\u00a0Also, apparently if you have children out of wedlock or don\u2019t go through the lengthy legal procedures to get married to your ideal partner, you get sent to prison. \u2026Okay, then. I\u2019m still not getting any vibes of dystopian horror, really, just a strict, conservative society\u2026 oh wait, it\u2019s mentioned that one of Aspen\u2019s brothers was beaten up by a police officer for stealing food the other day. Well, this might be the first novel I get to baptise with the shelf title \u2018Drive-By Dystopia\u2019. I hope it enjoys that honour!\u00a0Also, all of this dystopian exposition is only explained to us in the first couple of chapters, and scattered piecemeal throughout the rest of the novel. Ugh.\u00a0So what is \u2018The Selection\u2019, I hear you cry? Well, apparently in this world, the royal family don\u2019t seek other noble families for acceptable daughters or sons to wed their children off to. Nope, in this world, when the royal family need to marry off their kids, they let cameras into their palace. Along with girls or boys from all the castes, specially selected for their beauty and intelligence. It\u2019s an interesting premise, but it\u2019s executed rather poorly.\u00a0Firstly, I would expect America to be a LOT less intelligent and a bit poorer. Apparently she speaks fluent French and Spanish, she\u2019s been home-schooled all her life, but still has to play piano or sing at social functions to provide for her family. Uh\u2026 I\u2019m not saying that home-schooling can\u2019t be done on a budget, but historically, public education has allowed parents to take on work when before, they couldn\u2019t leave the children home alone. Some parents only allowed their children a few days a week at school. And some parents took them out of the school system to work once they learned to read, write, and do basic mathematics. So hopefully I\u2019m not alone in saying I don\u2019t quite understand why the author portrays America and her family as having to scrimp and save just to survive when her mother somehow has the time to teach each of her several children two foreign languages and musical theory, among other subjects. Okay, it\u2019s a nitpick, but it did baffle me all the same.\u00a0Secondly, why is this caste system so difficult for me to pin down? All I know is that Ones are really rich and Eights are really poor\u2026 so presumably your average-income, middle-class family would be a Four. However, there\u2019s no explanation about the intricacies of the caste system, excepting tidbits like if you\u2019re in a lower caste and somebody of a higher caste orders you to do something, you have to do it (like when America orders Aspen to help her pack her suitcase and he willingly does so), and employment opportunities get more and more menial the further down the caste ladder you go. Is that it? Really?\u00a0Well, anyway, just as\u00a0The Hunger Games\u00a0turns what is by all rights a brutal and tragic gladiator match into a glitzy reality show by drumming up public interest with dolled-up contestants and betting statistics,\u00a0The Selection\u00a0has a similar concept. The Selection itself is a reality TV show where the girls are competing for the prize of a lifetime: marrying a prince. And elevating the caste of their family. So, just like in\u00a0The Hunger Games\u00a0where you have the kids from certain districts groomed for this contest from childhood, those who are in higher castes are better trained to deal with the pressures of this contest.\u00a0America, of course, feels like she is extremely out of her league. The moment she is picked for the programme, she is taken away from her family, and because she\u2019s the main character in a YA romance novel, her middle name is Mary Sue.\u00a0Yeah, America Mary Sue Singer.\u00a0Not only does America have a good singing voice, she\u2019s also adored by the people and manages to convince Prince Charming to introduce some new policies to help the people. Of course, NOBODY HAD EVER THOUGHT OF THAT BEFORE! When America first lands in Angeles (more eye-rolling), the capital of Ill\u00e9a, there\u2019s a crowd waiting for her and cheering her on, and it\u2019s apparently slightly bigger than the crowd for her travel partner from the same neck of the woods. Want proof? I\u2019ve got it.\u00a0America\u2019s travel partner:\u00a0\u201cAmerica, you\u2019re so nice. All those people at the airport loved you.\u201d\u00a0America:\u00a0\u201cOh no, I was just being friendly.\u201d\u00a0And not only is America a Mary Sue, she\u2019s also a dumb, lovestruck teenager. I think I\u2019m pretty close to having bruxism listed on my medical and dental records if I read any more books with lovestruck teenagers in a romance that will not work in the long-term.\u00a0In the first few chapters, we\u2019re introduced to America\u2019s world, and her raggedy boyfriend Aspen. Aspen is, as mentioned before, poorer than America, but devoted to her. America pays his devotion by giving him her leftovers, and in kind he gives her pennies every time she sings to him. (To be fair to the poor kid, that\u2019s all he can afford.) Pretty much every scene with America and Aspen is highly romanticised, the kind of mush that causes eye-rolling so severe it can cause migraines. I get it, Ms. Cass. America and Aspen are in love. And it\u2019s SO HORRIBLE that America has to be taken away from her friends and family to compete for the love of a boy she doesn\u2019t know who is only marrying her for political gain. You didn\u2019t have to include that stupid, melodramatic scene in which Aspen breaks up with America \u2018for her own safety\u2019.\u00a0Look, I get it. Girl is taken away from her friends, family, and the boy she loves. But the boy she loves plunges a knife into her heart by breaking up with her \u2018for her own safety\u2019. But then she\u2019s introduced to the incredibly sweet Prince of her land who offers to help her get through the contest. Even though America\u2019s efforts are in this awkward grey zone where she\u2019s kind wanting to fail and kind of wanting to succeed.\u00a0(Also, I really hate the use of America as a first name. I don\u2019t quite know why, it just really bugs me.)\u00a0I\u2019d also like to add that like all dystopian worlds, there\u2019s a REBELLION outside their cosy little enclaves. Yes, a rebellion. In the world of\u00a0The Selection, there are two very distinct factions of rebels. There\u2019s the Northerners, who tend to sneak into the palace and wreck the place, seemingly looking for something, and the Southerners just want the monarchy to be completely demolished. Both use different methods to accomplish their goals, but there\u2019s something that the reader does not know: WHY THE HECK THEY\u2019RE REBELLING IN THE FIRST PLACE. My god, this is how NOT to write a dystopia. Like I\u2019ve said throughout this review, dystopian societies are usually oppressive, violent, and leave their residents too terrified to even think of life outside these walls, with no rules and regulations. This is just \u2018oh hey some people live on the fringes of society and they want to rebel against our monarchy\u2019. It\u2019s like they\u2019re a minor nuisance for the people in high society rather than a legitimate threat.\u00a0\u201cOh no, the bloody rebels broke into the palace again. That\u2019s the second time in three months. Oh well, I\u2019d better change the locks and do absolutely nothing about the sub-par security system I have in place, or think about WHY they\u2019re doing this to my castle and my keep.\u201dThe world-building and the socio-political aspects of this society just do not work. The writer makes it clear that history books are quite rare in this day and age, and history is not generally taught or studied. So, whilst the girls are having a history lesson for no reason whatsoever other than to shove in some exposition (a scenario which is a screen-writer\u2019s dream), we learn just how the kingdom of Ill\u00e9a came to be.\u00a0Here goes\u2026 The United States as we currently know it got so severely indebted to China, that the Chinese invaded. Why you would go so far as to invade a country with a failing economy is anyone\u2019s guess. Maybe it\u2019s revenge \u2013 the Chinese government in this world don\u2019t take kindly to countries borrowing money and being unable to pay them back. Who knows. (Also, where the hell is the UN?) So, while the Chinese invaded and took Americans in as labour, Russia reared its head. The American State of China was pulled between these two superpowers, when all of a sudden\u2026 from the bosom of Heaven itself, came Gregory Ill\u00e9a.\u00a0Gregory Ill\u00e9a. The man who reunited the States. The man who stopped all the fighting. (Apparently.) The man who turned the United States into a kingdom by marrying into a royal family. Which royal family? It\u2019s never explained. Shame, really.\u00a0Speaking of royal families, in the last third of the book we\u2019re introduced to the royal family of Swendway, Scandinavia. Oh, so apparently the world went to hell and Sweden, Denmark and Norway went back into being the Kalmar Union. There\u2019s also a representative from Honduragua, which has to be the best name of any country ever. The royal families don\u2019t do a damn thing, which is a bit annoying because, while they aren\u2019t built up very much, I was expecting them to bring the winds of change with them and actually GET THE PLOT GOING.\u00a0Yeah, the plot in this novel is really quite dull and disjointed. So many opportunities to develop characters, as well as more of the world, that are just dashed by ending abruptly or just sitting there completely unexplored. The multinational royal families came, saw, and certainly didn\u2019t conquer my attention. Wonderful.\u00a0I\u2019d also like to know just how the people in this world continue to watch The Selection. It just seems to go on forever. Barely halfway into the book, the first batch of girls are sent home, leaving behind\u2026 twenty seven? Man, why would the royal family even go to all this effort to marry off their son if there\u2019s still royal and noble families out there? Seriously. What\u2019s easier: organising a reality TV competition to find your next prince or princess from a pool of the prettiest and most intelligent boys and girls in the land, or just attending balls or other upper-crust social occasions in the hope that your children will be introduced to their significant other, who won\u2019t have to spend years learning the etiquette and other rules of the nobility?\u00a0I also don\u2019t often find myself clamouring for this, but this novel needed to be longer. Why on earth it was stopped at 327 pages when the story is STILL GOING is beyond me. No, it\u2019s not a cliffhanger. If our main character just puts on her thinking cap and decides to progress with the rest of the contest, that is NOT a good ending. It quite honestly seems extremely rushed. Why couldn\u2019t this novel be, say, one hundred or two hundred pages longer? Don\u2019t just bring back Aspen into the picture, some half-baked terrorist attack and the aforementioned adjusting of the thinking cap. It\u2019s not a cliffhanger and it doesn\u2019t give any finality to the story. It just awkwardly encourages the reader to continue. \u2026Maybe. \u2026Eventually. \u2026Whenever you feel like it.\u00a0So, why have I gone on for nearly five pages about the problems of this novel? Is it that bad? If it\u2019s bad, why have you given it that two stars? Something must have been good about it, right?\u00a0Yep, there were some good things about this book. Shocking, eh? I don\u2019t know why, but Maxon was actually quite likeable. He took an interest in America a little too quickly for my liking, but otherwise he\u2019s very princely and adorably oblivious, yet quick-witted. America is still a Mary Sue, but\u2026 it\u2019s weird to say that I got used to her after a while. And for that, I congratulate Ms. Cass. The novel wasn\u2019t too unbearable, but it really could have been helped if the world and the side characters had been better developed. 2/5.(This review is also available on my blog: http://nessasky.wordpress.com/2012/06...)"}, {"userName": "Nadhira Satria", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45365270-nadhira-satria", "userReview": "First of all,  DON'T JUDGEI\u2019m falling into a slump and nothing can get me up other than fluffy ass romance so am I going to reread the addictive trash aka my guilty pleasure that is the selection, yes I am.

Overall a really enjoyable fast read that I would recommend if you are looking for something light and not too serious - if you're in a reading slump this may help!"}, {"userName": "Kat Kennedy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3270188-kat-kennedy", "userReview": "Reason in comments."}, {"userName": "Emily (Books with Emily Fox)", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58160628-emily-books-with-emily-fox", "userReview": "So I never thought I would read this book, let alone finish it but it happened.Interestingly enough... I'll probably continue if I can find the other books at my library sale...No idea how to rate it but it was as I expected. A bit of a guilty read, fast paced, I rolled my eyes a few times and I didn't like the love triangle but again... I finished it and want to continue so I guess it wasn't so bad!"}, {"userName": "Juliana Zapata", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28636277-juliana-zapata", "userReview": "Encantada, fascinada y enamorada de esta historia.

I've been wanting to get to this series for so long and it most definitely did not disappoint. I love the names of the three main characters, America, Aspen, and Prince Maxon. Awesome names. To describe America Singer, I would say she is loyal, tough, passionate, and at the same time, vulnerable and a little bit naive. I instantly fell in love with her. Aspen is someone she has known all her life and the last two years, they fell in love. But in this society, people are divided by castes. America is a 5 which is below the average. They are artists and musicians but frequently struggle for money. Aspen is a six. They frequently clean houses and other such jobs and never have enough money for food or clothes. Five's are not allowed to marry six's. Their relationship is secret. But, Aspen has decided that he has to let her go. He cannot provide for her and feels she can do better. The Royal Family has decided it is time for their young Prince Maxon to find a wife. So they hold a lottery and eligible young ladies send in an application. 35 ladies are chosen to participate in The Selection. Hopefully The Prince will find his future bride among these young women. America does not want to enter but Aspen tells her he wants her to and so does her family. And, much to her surprise, she is chosen. So, she goes off to the Royal Palace. She tastes food like she never has tasted before. She gets to wear the most beautiful gowns. And, she meets Prince Maxon. I INSTANTLY fell in love with Maxon. He is so adorable. And there is an instant connection between he and America. I was team Maxon from their first meeting. This book is super sweet and I just hated to have to put it down. I hope I can inspire anyone who reads this to give it a try."}], "description": "For thirty-five girls, the Selection is the chance of a lifetime.
