I would definitely classify this story as a New Adult novel, which I really hate, but this one was actually rather engrossing! There is a definite mystery element to the story, but it is a very rudimentary one. In fact, the entire story felt rather simplistic!We only get broad strokes when it comes to Kennedy, we don't get a lot of detail when it comes to her thought processes. Most of the events that occur in the story are told to us, rather than shown to us, so the combination of the two make it difficult to connect with Kennedy overall. The topic the story focused on is rather saddening in itself, so lacking that emotional connection to the story makes it harder to enjoy. Supporting characters that weren't Christians felt superficial at best, and the Christian ones weren't as in depth as I'd like.I believe that this is the author's first book, and it certainly reads like that, even as such a quick read. I liked the fact that the story was complete for the most part, but that there were enough loose ends to progress to the next book. I was entertained enough with this that I'll probably read the next book in the series at some point."}, {"userName": "Lydia Howe", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35587655-lydia-howe", "userReview": "This book drew me in right away cause it's about a TCK (Third Culture Kids), and TCKs are one of those things in life that I'm passionate about. There were times when I wasn't exactly sure what to think about this book. The cover made it look like a mystery or thriller, but then it started out with a really nice, calm pace. (I had nothing wrong with the pace - in fact I liked it a lot. It just wasn't what I was expecting from the cover.) But then part way through the pace really picks up and the adventure begins happening. I was pulled into the story and intrigued by it. The book kept me wanting to come back for more. I felt like Kennedy, the main character, was well developed. I also connected with her, which isn't something that always happens, so that was a big plus. The book dealt with some tough subjects, like totally not for kids. I thought it was well done, and even though there was TONS of information, it didn't come across as preachy, so that was really nice. There weren't a lot of unnecessary details, but there was enough to make it realistic and at one point I even was slightly sick to my stomach because of all that was going on. I'm not sure if I can say I \"enjoyed\" this book, but it was amazing enough that I started reading the second book in the series as soon as I finished this first one. Way to go, Miss Alana!"}, {"userName": "Julia Wilson", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29770295-julia-wilson", "userReview": "Unplanned by Alana Terry is a fast paced contemporary Christian suspense which I really enjoyed. At its heart the focus is pro life and recognising that God has His hand on us, even when we are still in the womb.God, too was at the centre. For some, trusting God is easy. For others, life can intrude. \"What was the point in worshipping a God who wouldn't lift His finger to rescue these precious souls?\" God sees us all. He sees us before we are born. His rescue plan may not be ours but no one slips away unnoticed.The peace of God can descend on those who trust, even in the midst of chaos. God's peace does not announce itself loudly, but quietly and gently envelopes us, securing us in His arms.The novel shows that sometimes we become so comfortable with God that we forget His awesome power. \"Had God become such an everyday part of her life, that there was no room left for awe?\"There is the theme of protection. Protection may come in the form of God (always) and people too.Grief is a powerful motivating factor. Grief may consume souls who then act in a way that is contrary to their character.Trust is another theme. \"Something was tugging at her heart - an invitation to trust.\" We cannot go through life in isolation. We need to trust God and we need to trust others.Family is important. Even though miles may separate, the reader can 'feel' the loving arms of parental love stretching out. How much greater is God's love for us?Prayer is our hotline to God. He longs to hear from us. Sometimes we feel He is not listening. \"Please, God. Aren't You listening?\" Just because we cannot sense God does not mean He is not there. He has promised to never leave us nor forsake us.Unplanned was a cracking thriller that I read with a racing heart to its conclusion. It was my first by Alana Terry but I shall be back for more. I was glad to see Unplanned is the first book in the Kennedy Stern Christian suspense series so plenty more to read!I received this book for free. A favourable review was not required and all views expressed are my own."}, {"userName": "Abby A.", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17899124-abby-a", "userReview": "Well, that was interesting for sure.

When I read the book\u2019s synopsis a while back, I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t put together the fact that this is the daughter who is mentioned as being away at college in Torn Asunder. If you have read the books set in China and North Korea, then this is a fun tie-in to them and I enjoyed hearing her perspective on growing up in the Stern household as they housed and prepared Secret Seminary students to enter into very dangerous missions. However, if you have not read the other stories by Alana Terry, don\u2019t worry, Unplanned stands completely on its own.This book deals with the topic of abortion and comes from a pro-life viewpoint. But it is not just a simple storyline that attempts to pull a reader to one side of the debate or the other. There are many questions raised by Kennedy as she navigates the disturbing situation that she finds herself in the middle of. I think the author did such a great job of showing that Kennedy is a young woman who is questioning everything, including her upbringing, her feelings of apathy toward God, even the reasons she is pro-life. Some very good questions are raised in this book.Packed with intense mystery and suspense, the twists and turns will keep the reader enthralled. There are a few violent scenes toward the end of the book, as well as a medical situation that is described in some detail. I do feel that these details were important to the story, and I believe the author handled them in the best way possible. I simply mention it for readers who may be more sensitive to this type of thing.I really enjoyed this story and look forward to reading more in the series.My thanks to the author for the complimentary copy of this book that I received in exchange for an honest review.You can read this review on my blog at:https://brittreadsfiction.wordpress.c..."}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6167870-beth", "userReview": "Christian suspense. I'd like to rate this more highly, because I respected that this was about the topic of abortion. However, I felt there were far too many implausibilities and repetitious elements. For example, it's unbelievable that a crisis pregnancy center would begin operation with no trained staff, or that the main character would have been asked to man the phones with no training, and take the phone off premises. Also, no good reason was given for the main character's being abducted. It was mentioned many, many times that a drug would be ineffective, when in fact it would be effective but end up causing death to more than the fetus. I could go on, but basically I found myself turning pages just to get through the peril and try to understand the whys. I didn't find satisfactory conclusions."}, {"userName": "Daphne Self", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5552166-daphne-self", "userReview": "Goodreads has a 2 star at \"it was ok\" and that's what I thought of this novel. It's ok. If it was marketed as a young adult or new adult novel then the ranking could have been higher which is why I'm giving it 3 stars. The theme is relevant and clean. The topic is brutally honest but slightly glossed over. The plot didn't have much depth to it but it did have a fast pace to it. The character needed a little more development, especially her rash judgement of people who had not lived where she had lived.Because of how the topic was handled, how the suspense was resolved in a tidy way, and how what could have been a deep plot to explore but was only lightly touched upon, I would rank this as good young adult novel for older teens. Especially as a way to help them understand the sanctity of life and what it really means to be pro-life."}, {"userName": "Lou", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19770032-lou", "userReview": "Just when I think Alana Terry can't be better, she does it again!This book is SO GREAT!

Kennedy determines to discover who this girl is in order to help her, but soon finds herself in danger because of her knowledge of the girl herself.Unplanned was a whirlwind. I expected as much from Alana Terry, whose books have often brought me to stress or tears over the horrible situations the characters had to face. This one, however, also made a larger impact on my life because of its greater relevance to daily life in America.In addition to the mystery and danger in Unplanned, Kennedy faces the controversy over abortion. Her beliefs are greatly challenged before she makes the decision for pro-life from her own knowledge and experience rather than her parents\u2019. Making one\u2019s own decision out of one\u2019s own research was something the author stressed in the situation, something that is relevant to nearly everyone who reads this book.One thing I noticed was that Alana Terry did a good job showing what a first year in college is like. Having recently experienced it myself, I can honestly say that Kennedy\u2019s experiences were true to life, making her more relatable to the reader.The plot focused more on the issue of abortion and helping the pregnant girl than on the suspense. It is not preachy, but it was definitely not as full of action, torture, escapes, and suspense as previous ones, such as Torn Asunder (whose characters were mentioned in Unplanned). Unplanned was a great book I would recommend to others.

She drew me into the story immediately and I couldn't stop reading. Kennedy is a first year pre-med student at Harvard and away from her missionary parents in China. She reconnects with old family friends and becomes a volunteer for their pregnancy hotline before she can bat an eye.. She has very little time to spare and no idea what she is involved with and no idea what to say if someone were to call on her watch. She receives a disturbing call which pulls Kennedy into an intriguing, suspenseful, and frightening situation. The subject of this book is abortion. The author doesn't preach or rant for one side or the other but gives the reader much to ponder. I appreciated her approach and feel that even though she is a Christian author her writing opens the door for anyone to read it.This book grabs you on page one so fasten your seatbelt until the last page.

Not so much bad grammar and spelling errors but how things were described and how characters spoke. For example, the pastor friend was the head Pastor of a mega church (or so it was described I think at one point) but he always seemed awkward or nervous to me. I would think if he was in that position he would seem more comfortable around people. I'm also still kinda confused on a couple of points in the conclusion. Maybe the reading/writing level is better suited for a teen reader.

This one is my favorite yet, with The Beloved Daughter now a very close second. I could not put this book down. From the moment I read about the first phone call, I was driven to find out what will happen to the caller. This book tackles the very difficult issue of abortion. I am 100% pro-life without exceptions, but I am often dismayed by the dismissive attitude of some who share my conviction on the issue. There can be very complex and painful circumstances involved, and this novel explores one of these in the most thoughtful and considerate way I have seen in any writing on the subject.

Lots of suspense, questions, and cultural shock. Kennedy is starting her first year in premed and studying and keeping up her GPA is all that's on her mind. She's spent ten years overseas with her missionary parents and coming back to the U.S. is a big shock and adjustment for her. In spite of her reservations, her former pastor and his wife talk her into volunteering in their new pregnancy crisis center. Her first phone call is from a scared 13 yr old that's five months pregnant. Kennedy worries about this child but has no way of knowing who she is or where she lives. The suspense and where the majority of the story is taken from there will leave your heart pounding and you'll feel like you should be praying for the victims as well. The subject of abortion is foremost but not delivered in a preachy way. Kennedy also is dealing with missing her parents and questioning if God is really there and why doesn't he answer her prayers. You will be taken on a journey you never expected to make but maybe will come out of it closer to God just as Kennedy does.I received this book from the author through Bookfun and was not required to write a review, positive or otherwise."}, {"userName": "Deena", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/368836-deena", "userReview": "Unplanned is a unique take on the abortion debate. Kennedy is trying to adjust to being back in the States, having spent years as a missionary kid in a foreign country. Overwhelmed by cultural differences, her pre-med courses at the university, and the noise that makes up America, she allows herself to be persuaded into answering the hotline for a brand new crisis pregnancy center.I struggled with this, because I've volunteered at more than one CPC, and I felt like the author should have done more research. No one gets handed a phone without proper training. And I really don't think a center would open with just two people on staff, regardless of their passion and dedication to the unborn.The tension between Kennedy and her family was dropped into the story unexpectedly. I would have liked more backstory on her relationship with her parents and siblings, as well as details about their mission work. This left me feeling like I'd missed the first 15 minutes of a movie...and the most critical moments of the character's life.The suspense was graphic and intense, and I tried to believe it was possible, but I struggled.

During the Thanksgiving holiday, I was able to read four of the five books, only because the 5th wasn\u2019t available yet. That one is on my Christmas list. There really are two sides to every story. There are a few characters in this series that I think make the entire series: First of all, Kennedy, the main character, who is a young adult (college age) and she struggles in her faith. She has questions. She questions whether she needs more \u201cworks\u201d and what exactly grace means in her life when relating to her Heavenly Father. She questions how \u201cdeep\u201d of a relationship with God she has\u2026 all questions that each of us need to answer in our own lives, in our own time, in our own way with God Himself in order to grow the strong roots needed to withstand life\u2019s challenges. As I was reading this book, I could already envision my children who are fast approaching this age and thinking\u2026 they will soon be having these types of internal dialogue (if not already) and that\u2019s a good thing. My other favorite characters were the couple Carl and Sandy. Oh my - at first I thought they were so pushy and \u201cin your face\u201d with Kennedy but then I realized, they just love to love people and do so well at showing God\u2019s love. They truly became my favorites, even more than Kennedy herself. Part of that could be my age and I can relate to them even more. I wondered if Sandy was \u201ctoo perfect\u201d but nope, in the fourth book in the series, I was relieved to see that she was human also and stress and exhaustion got to her at times too and she wasn\u2019t as put together as she appeared in the first three books. However, I think also that spoke directly to me because it was during the Thanksgiving holiday when I was purposefully working on recharging my over-exhausted batteries that God used this fiction story to remind me of a few things. First of all, He only wants me to say \u201cyes\u201d to His agenda and when I say \u201cyes\u201d to more than what He wants (which is ultimately disobedience), then I won\u2019t have the same spirit of generosity, kindness, patience etc. that I admired in Sandy because there will be no reserve left to allow that overflow in my life. When I am living with only the \u201cyes\u2019s\u201d on my plate that God gives, I am more able to live the characteristics I admired in a fictional character. Second, sometimes God allows hard seasons in our lives. They are temporary and if we allow Him to work through us during the hard, sometimes we can be a good witness of how we handle hard. Not perfectly, but still with His spirit shining through our lives. Carl - I loved Carl. I loved the way he presented the example of Christ in his imperfect but wonderful ways. Sometimes pushy, sometimes more outspoken than I\u2019m comfortable with, but always with love. Love was evident in every interaction Carl had, no matter who it was with. Yup, I think Carl was my favorite character in the entire book. I can\u2019t forget Willow, Reuben and Nick. I wasn\u2019t sure what to think about Reuben at first. Was he hiding something\u2026 would he hurt Kennedy? Was he really the friend he claimed to be? What were his feelings? And Willow\u2026 wow. God used this book to show how we can be salt and light to everyone in this world and also how we can peacefully coexist with others who don\u2019t share our beliefs without compromising our own or judging theirs. Love. The central theme of the books and I believe what is going to help our country unite during this season that we find ourselves in. And Nick\u2026 I\u2019m still not sure how I feel about Nick. I enjoyed getting to know a little more about his background in book #4 and hope there is more involvement with Nick in the 5th book. His character intrigues me enough to want to continue to get to know him. Unplanned was the first book. This book dealt with the topic of abortion and I have to say, I went into the book a little skeptical, wondering how the author was going to take the topic and try to sway my beliefs. If anything, the author presented both sides of the debate in such a way that it reinforced what I already believe, yet helped me see the \u201cother side\u201d with more compassion. Paralyzed dealt with posttraumatic stress disorder and was a great suspenseful book. The author did a great job keeping me engrossed in the book, wanting to see what happened next. Policed dealt with a few surprise twists and turns that I wasn\u2019t expecting. I won\u2019t name them because I don\u2019t want to ruin the suspense of the novel, but just know you won\u2019t want to put the book down until the last page. This book however left me sad\u2026 grieving. Sometimes life is like that, isn\u2019t it? Sometimes books with sad endings mirror life that has sad endings, because the war really isn\u2019t won until we reach Heaven. Therefore, intermixed with all the \u201chappy\u201d and blessings God gives us, there are still elements of sad. Straightened. Given the book cover, I wasn\u2019t sure where the author was going to take this book but I loved it. I couldn\u2019t stop reading this one either. The best part of the books, in my opinion, is that it is evident that God is using the author\u2019s use of fiction and adventure and writing of suspense to open dialogue about topics that people are afraid to talk to others about. Afraid to talk to people with similar points of view but especially afraid to talk to people with opposing points of view. She shows how dialogue can be had in very nonthreatening ways with people who don\u2019t share our opinions. Jesus Himself went and walked among the sick, because the healthy don\u2019t need a doctor. Whatever side of the fence you stand on the topics discussed in these books, I believe you will walk away with a broader understanding. Not necessarily where your mind has been changed\u2026 maybe they will further cement your beliefs that you already have, but with a better sense of understanding if not of the topics themselves, then ways to relate to others about these sensitive topics, ways that God Himself would approve of."}, {"userName": "Betti", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7931808-betti", "userReview": "Incredible suspense!Unplanned.....a word that conjures up many different ideas.

I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve read any of Alana Terry\u2019s books before but this sure won\u2019t be the last oneI was provided a e-copy of this book to read but was not given any monetary compensation or required to review it."}], "description": "When Kennedy Stern\u2019s childhood pastor asks her to volunteer at his new pregnancy center, she carves time out of her rigorous college schedule to promote the cause of the unborn. After receiving a disturbing call from someone far too young to carry a child in the first place, Kennedy can no longer blindly hide behind the pro-life platitudes she grew up believing. She resolves to locate the unknown girl but winds up entrenched in a mystery that grows more convoluted as it unfolds. Soon, Kennedy finds herself a pawn in a deadly game of intrigue, at the mercy of those who consider a few innocent lives a small ransom to pay in exchange for personal and political victory. Alana Terry has won awards from Women of Faith, the Book Club Network, Grace Awards, Readers' Favorite, and more. Unplanned was a finalist in the Deep River Books writing contest. The ebook version contains discussion questions for personal reflection or group study.", "title": "Unplanned\n      \n          (Kennedy Stern #1)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25335376-unplanned", "average": 3.98, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1428685875l/25335376.jpg", "reviews": 113, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7048073.Alana_Terry", "name": "Alana Terry"}], "type": ["Christian Fiction", "Mystery", "Christian", "Fiction", "Contemporary"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25335376-unplanned", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25758069-unplanned", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17798886-the-beloved-daughter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27423786-paralyzed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23202955-slave-again", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30296610-policed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36242150-what-dreams-may-come"]}
