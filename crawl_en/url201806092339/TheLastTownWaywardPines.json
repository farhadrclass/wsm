We should all savor this moment.And that's exactly what this series is like. You don't want to go into them knowing much but after you read them you want to talk about them..but you can't. Don't spoil them for people. Let them experience the WTFery all on their own.\nNothing that could be explained or described, because you didn't just hear it.You felt it's meaning.And it's meaning was this: Hell is coming.This series is not great literature, and it really does not try to be. It is very entertaining and well worth the time to read. These books are inventive and new and don't follow the everyday tropes that so many books fall into. You'll be asking yourself questions and shaking your head as you try and figure out how this evil genius named Blake Crouch is twisting you this way.\nI still haven't watched the show based on these books but as I was reading these I saw more of Ethan Burke's character in this guy...\nThan I would have imagined could be portrayed by this one....\n\"Sometimes we have to do things we don't want to.\"\"Why?\"\"Because they're the right things.\"Crouch wraps up this trilogy very well but you still deep down want more. That's a good thing.\nBooksource: Netgalley in exchange for review.ETA: Friend spotlight: I'm sick of the popularity contests here on GR that force people to \"bump up\" their reviews so that they get more likes. So I'm going to start spotlighting some of my friends reviews that should get attention.For this book check out Dan 2.0's review. 2.0 is an ornery reader and when he gives a review 3 stars that means it's actually a good book. He reads books that I love and gives them one stars just to tick me off. I somewhat like him anyways.

I gave you food. I gave you shelter. I gave you purpose. I protected you from the knowledge you couldn\u2019t handle. From the harsh truth of the world that exists beyond the fence. And each of you had to do one thing. One! Goddamn! Thing!\u201d He shrieked the words. \u201cObey me.\u201dDavid Pilcher is suffering from a god complex. Not as difficult to understand as it has been for other figures throughout history, especially since humanity only exists at this point in time because he made it so. The question is, was it meant to be saved?The people are nestled in their Eden, a place called Wayward Pines. Pilcher has eliminated all the distractions that kept people from interacting face to face, such as the internet, iPads, iPhones, that allowed people to become mired in social media instead of having actual relationships with people. He was trying to recreate a 1950s sensibility. The thing of it is, no matter what you do, it is impossible to make people happy. Humanity isn\u2019t designed to allow itself to be contented, sooner or later someone is going to come along who wants free will and will do whatever it takes to get it. That man is Ethan Burke.He offers the apple, and they eat it. He rips the gossamer from around their eyes and lets them see and experience the full horror of what has happened to their world. Mind blowing. Pilcher is beyond furious, but then he has a good role model from the God depicted in the Bible. He throws the biggest tantrum since that other God flooded the Earth. He, too, can destroy what he created. If they disobey, then they must pay the price. He knows from experience that people can\u2019t necessarily handle the truth. \u201dYour fatal flaw, Ethan, is that you\u2019re under the mistaken impression that people are like you. That they have the courage, your fearlessness, your will. You and I are exceptions, cut from the same cloth. Even my people in the mountain struggle with the fear. But not you and me. We know the truth. We aren\u2019t afraid to look it in the eye. Only difference being, I\u2019m aware of this fact, and it\u2019s something you\u2019re going to learn slowly and painfully and at great cost of human life. But you\u2019ll remember this conversation one day, Ethan. You\u2019ll understand why I did the things I did.\u201dHe shuts down the electric fence. He lets the aberrations in. \u201dNone of them were larger than he was, but their muscle tone was extraordinary.They looked---Like humanity wrapped in the trappings of a monster.Equipped with talons, instead of fingers, teeth designed for cutting and tearing, they brandished arms that seemed too long in proportion to the rest of their body. Longer even than their legs.He said under his breath, like a prayer, \u2018What the hell are you?\u2019Fear suddenly wore him like a glove.\u201dI must admit that season one of Wayward Pines was must see TV every week. The first season covers all three books. There are variations between the books and the show, but not really that many. Blake Crouch was heavily involved with the making of the TV series. Season Two is starting up in May of 2016 and will be based on new material not covered in the books. I was content for them to stop with just one season, but I have to admit I\u2019m curious to see where they intend to go with the concept. The real tension and psychological discomfort was much higher in the first two books. This book is more of one long chase scene, still compelling, but all the rabbits have been pulled out of the hat in the earlier two books. Burke becomes Moses, and the responsibility weighs heavily on him.\u201dThere was no coming to terms with the fact that he was a member of a species on the verge of extinction.It filled every moment with meaning.It filled every moment with horror.\u201dIf you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit http://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at:https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten"}, {"userName": "Dan Schwent", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/870755-dan-schwent", "userReview": "When Ethan Burke reveals the truth about Wayward Pines, the ensuing chaos is nothing compared to the hell unleashed when David Pilcher throws open the gates...I got this from Netgalley.The Wayward Pines trilogy draws to a close with The Last Town. How does it stack up?Well, while the books all feature the same characters and share the same setting, they aren't really the same type of books. Pines is a paranoid tale of a man trying to unravel the truth. Wayward is a tale of a man struggling with that truth. And The Last Town is more survival horror than anything else.The pace is pretty frantic with aberrations swarming the town. Throw in the monkey wrench that is Hassler and it's off to the races. Lots of people die and Wayward Pines is left with an uncertain future.As with the previous book, much of my dislike of this book has to do with Pines setting the bar way too high. It's a pretty suspenseful tale but doesn't stack up to it's progenitor very well, mostly because, again, Pines set the bar too high.The Last Town, while not my favorite of the series, wrapped up the tale of Wayward Pines in a very satisfactory way. Three out of five stars."}, {"userName": "Helen \u03a1\u03bf\u03b6\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03af \u0395\u03c9\u03c3\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2   Vernus Portitor Arcanus

God!!!! This can't be the end! I loved this series so much! There must be more of it!! We must learn what happens next! I liked everything about the last book of the Pines series. First of all the way of narration which wad very different than the other two books. Againn there is the third person narration, but it is given through the viewpoints of many different people. Also there are some allusions to the past which helps us understand some things better. Next, we go to the action. Full of it from beginning to end! This action enhanced my feelings while reading! As for the characters I find that the\u0157e is a developement and a deeper understanding of their actions which makes a perfect novel.  Finally, I should mention the messages the author wants to convey! The future of humamity, the hope, the affect our behaviour has on others and ultimately if the free will is something that divides or unites us! These and many more. I just wanted more for the ending... Again questions were anwered, and others were raised. But this is how Mr. Crouch makes us thinking about this great series the whole time. Maybe we are the ones that will figure out the ending. Weather this will be a happy one or not. WELL DONE MR. CROUCH!!!!!"}, {"userName": "Edward Lorn", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8850418-edward-lorn", "userReview": "First thing's first: I have no clue how they're going to make this a television series with a shelf life longer than three seasons. Hell, two seasons are going to be pushing it. Three books were perfect, but you could probably fit all of the novels into two seasons. Now to discuss this final book. It was awesome. One helluva thrill ride with an ending I didn't see coming. You'll probably see the ending coming a mile away, but I was so engrossed with the tale that I couldn't picture the outcome I received. I couldn't see the forest for the trees, so to speak. Blake Crouch put me there. His writing is seemingly effortless, and you just kinda glide along. It's easy to get lost in Wayward Pines, and I suggest you allow yourself to become hypnotized. You'll have much more fun.Before I continue, I must make note of one scene that I simply fucking adored. There's this lady playing solitaire while her house is being invaded by monsters. The monster is screeching at her, and she's steadily telling it to stop being rude, to mind its manners in her home. The resulting scene is hilarious. I was crying, I was laughing so hard. I don't know if Blake meant for this scene to be that funny, but it hit me in the right spot at the right moment. Bravo.I had a damn good time with this series, and I feel this final book was a fitting end. I could have done without the Rick , Shane, and Lori love story, but it's a minor gripe. If you're not a fan of The Walking Dead you probably won't get that reference, so I apologize. Just know that there's unneeded love-triangle shenanigans afoot here and it annoyed me enough to gripe about it. This series made me feel like a kid again. It had all the mystery, action, and carnage Little E. sought in his entertainment. I will watch the M. Night Shigellosis TV series with trepidation. I honestly do not see him being involved in anything worth more than a squirt of piss, and I'm almost certain he will somehow suck all the fun out of this cool concept, but I'm going to give it a shot.Finally, a note on the audiobooks. Paul Michael Garcia is a fantastic narrator. His performance in this series is no different. I highly recommend anything PMG performs, and especially recommend the Wayward Pines series. In summation: Yeah, I loved this journey, but your mileage might vary. I will say I loved it so much I hope that there are more books, even though I know they would be forced. I recommend this series to anyone looking to feel like a kid again, anyone wanting to have that sense of awe and astonishment, that feeling of an adventure started and a journey accomplished. But, dude, honestly, it's just really fucking cool. Final Judgment: Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!"}, {"userName": "Jason Brant", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8373533-jason-brant", "userReview": "A year ago, I'd never heard of Blake Crouch.Now, he's one of my favorite authors. His pace and economy of words make for a style that really hits home with me. The action scenes in his books are amplified by his short, staccato sentences and paragraphs, keeping you glued to the pages (or your Kindle). There's no fluff, no fat, that needs trimmed. It's a style that I wish more authors had.I hold The Wayward Pines Series up with Wool and other mind-blowing sagas of the past few years. Ethan Burke is a flawed, but powerful character that keeps you rooting for him, despite the mistakes he's made in the past. There's no quit in the man, no matter the situation he finds himself in.I was fortunate enough to get an ARC of this and I plowed through it in two days. This final book was worth the wait. The action kicks off right away and doesn't let up. The pace is brutal and makes it hard to step away for inconsequential things like food or sleep.If I have one complaint, it's that Crouch doesn't release books often enough. He's clearly a fast writer, but I read his stuff so rapidly that it feels like I'm always waiting forever for his next work. Blake, if you're going to hook me on your stuff, then I need the fixes to come faster!"}, {"userName": "Athena Shardbearer", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159427-athena-shardbearer", "userReview": "Wayward Pines, you have stolen my sanity and I want more!!!!

I\u2019d advise you to fuel up because the action comes fast and furious, with no discernible letup in sight. There won\u2019t even be much time for you to pause and catch your breath, until around the 60% mark.Wow, that was absolute madness, but I think you may\u2019ve overdone it. I see that adrenaline dump coming, so let\u2019s slow things down a bit. *Insert love triangle* Oh hell no, don\u2019t even go there! You\u2019re way too far into the story for that nonsense.

Back on my review of Pines I left a rather nasty remark about how stupid Fox was for condensing this trilogy into a ten episode miniseries. But after wrapping things up, I can now see the logic of that decision\u2014considering the entire tale occurs over a brief three week period, with no discernible gaps in the storyline from one book to the next. In fact, you could even posit that the trilogy was a single book cleverly broken down into three parts. So, I apologize for that nasty comment, Fox, my bad. Although, I\u2019m still pissed you didn\u2019t pick up that Locke and Key pilot, so . . .

You sucked me in with \u201cPines\u201d, kept me intrigued with \u201cWayward\u201d, and then slapped me in the face with \u201cThe Last Town\u201dDon\u2019t get me wrong. I didn\u2019t hate the book. I actually thought it was okay. And on its own it probably deserves a 3-star rating. The reason it gets a 2, however, is because of its potential. This book should have been awesome. It should have been a kick-ass finale to the Wayward Pines trilogy, but it wasn\u2019t. Mr. Crouch could have ended the saga with a bang and instead ended it with a whimper, and it\u2019s a damn shame.Let\u2019s go back to \u201cPines\u201d. I loved it. It was a fast-paced, entertaining, violent mystery with a few awesome scenes (the fetes and introduction to the abbies come to mind) and an explosive ending that I never saw coming. I thought it was a great book that didn\u2019t need a sequel.And then \u201cWayward\u201d came out\u2026And I loved it. It advanced the story, let us see Ethan struggle with concealing the truth, introduced us to Adam Hassler (a man actually surviving outside of the fence? WHAT?!), and hinted at a second love triangle (between Adam, Ethan and Teresa, in addition to the one between Ethan, Teresa, and Kate) then, again, blew me away with a killer cliffhanger ending that forced me to read part 3. It was as if Mr. Crouch literally grabbed me by the throat and said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to buy book 3!\u201d and I gladly said, \u201cYes, Sir!\u201dThen \u201cThe Last Town\u201d came out, and it underwhelmed. The problems with this book are numerous, and I suspect they all stem from a single source. It\u2019s clear to me Mr. Crouch was given a deadline that he simply could not meet without sacrificing the integrity of his novel, and sacrifice it he did. Just look at its length compared to books 1 and 2. \u201cPines\u201d: 309 pages\u201cWayward\u201d: 322 pages \u201cThe Last Town\u201d: 285 pages It\u2019s the runt of the litter, and by a full 24 pages! This is part 3, Blake (I\u2019m calling you Blake from now on. Screw Mr. Crouch!). This is the finale. Everything that happened in books 1 and 2 has been building to this. This book should have been the longest of the three. Not the shortest. And certainly not the shortest by 24 pages. To be totally honest, this book should have had at least another 50 pages in it. There were two books worth of loose ends to tie up, Crouch (I\u2019m sticking with just Crouch. Screw Blake!), and instead of actually tying them up, you gave us a rushed, half-assed ending that once read by your editor should have gotten you a quick slap in the face. Let\u2019s dive in shall we?Hassler:In \u201cWayward\u201d, we\u2019re told Adam Hassler is still alive. My thought process upon learning this: \u201cEthan\u2019s boss? No way! And he\u2019s been living outside of the fence? And he\u2019s in love with Ethan\u2019s wife? Why is he outside of town? How has he been able to survive out there? Why is he headed back to the town now? What did he find out there?\u201dThe addition of Hassler to the story was brilliant. Knowing he was coming back to town for book 3 made me practically salivate over his eventual confrontation with Ethan and I was dying to know the answers to the above questions. And what were those answers? Let\u2019s see:Why is he outside of town? Not sure. He was on a mission of some kind. What mission? I have no idea. It\u2019s not made clear. Pilcher implies there was no mission and that he just wanted to get rid of Hassler. If that\u2019s the case, why not just kill him? But there had to be an actual mission, right? Otherwise, why the hell would Hassler go outside in the first place? Wasn\u2019t he the happiest he had ever been while living in Wayward Pines with Theresa and Ben? What could Pilcher have possibly told him to make him willingly leave Wayward Pines on a suicide mission outside? Did Pilcher force him to leave? If he did, again, why not just kill Hassler instead? And why did Hassler come back anyway? Was it because he found nothing? What made him decide he finally found nothing? And why did he wait so long to decide that? Dude, you had a beautiful woman and child waiting for you in Wayward Pines. Why would you stay away for three years? Couldn\u2019t you have been gone for a few months instead? How long does it take to find nothing? Horrible character exchanges: Then there are the many potentially emotional points that Crouch just glosses over. Like when Alan finds out Pilcher murdered his daughter and is so enraged that he threatens to kill Pilcher. He and Ethan have this exchange.Alan: AHHHHHH! I\u2019m gonna kill Pilcher!Ethan: No, I am.Alan: Okay.There is no way this exchange goes down this way from what we know about Alan. He should have been ready to rip Pilcher apart with his bare hands. He and Ethan should have practically come to blows over who gets to kill Pilcher. But they don\u2019t because\u2026I have no idea, and I don\u2019t think Crouch does either.This happens again when everyone is hiding in the cave and Ethan tells Ben he is going to the arc.Ethan: I have to go Ben.Ben: (crying) But Dad, I don\u2019t want you to go!Ethan: But I\u2019m going to.Ben: Okay.Come on, Crouch! Give the kid a little more time to come to terms with his father\u2019s suicide mission. Or don\u2019t let him come to terms with it at all and force Ethan to leave with his son mad at him. Just make your characters act like real people, damn it!Characters acting like moronsHere a few things that just didn\u2019t add up:When Ethan\u2019s group makes it to the cave, it\u2019s revealed some people are missing family members who were in other groups. In a crisis, why the hell would you separate from your family? Everyone was together at the fete, then Ethan revealed the truth, Pilcher opened the gate, and everyone stood around and talked about the truth. Sure, some people went home (with their families) but most stayed. So when the hell did so many families get separated? Why would they do that? Why would you not go into the same group and head for the tunnels together?Even when characters make the right decision, they do it for the wrong reason. Like when Ethan, Kate, and two other characters whose names I can\u2019t remember head to the arc. They decide to avoid the tunnels and stay above ground. Ethan\u2019s reasoning for this is so that if they are spotted, they can run. So you plan to outrun the four-legged abbies who are clearly faster than you? Wrong. You stay out of the tunnels because the abbies already found the tunnels and could still be down their feeding on the other groups.Also, did Crouch really force Hassler and Kate to be together in the end? Ugh.In conclusion, this book was bad. Though mildly entertaining, it was sloppily written and poorly edited. I really wish Crouch had more time to work on this one. It could have been great."}, {"userName": "Shandra", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23160533-shandra", "userReview": "Review:Actual rating: 4 I'm-So-Conflicted stars.

It is difficult to write a review of this book without spoiling events that happened in the first two. Crouch starts the third and final book in the Wayward Pines trilogy at a frantic pace. The pace was dramatically intense almost to the detriment of the story, almost. Usually books that are pegged to be thrillers are a slow burn climbing to an action packed and secret revealing climax at the end. This book's structure was the opposite.We start off with thrilling adventure, action, and fight sequences that morph into character developments at about the 2/3 point. It was a bit startling to me but a welcome surprise.True fans of the series will hopefully find this a satisfying end to the drama that was Wayward Pines.

The first two books in this series were very light reads, but this one seemed almost ridiculously light -- I read it in a single two-hour sitting, and I felt like not much could have taken place in a story that short.This book is also VERY heavy-handed with the God/creation myth allegory. There were a few times where a character would be referencing God, Satan and/or the angels where I just had to groan. The author just seemed to be trying too hard to make sure that the novel had a theme. To my mind, themes are fine, but there needs to be a little bit of subtlety. As the old adage goes, \"show, don't tell.\"Definitely not a great book, but it wasn't a total failure.

I listened to the audio book and the same narrator does a great job with the story.This is an interesting and thought provoking story overall. By the third book though, the theme starts to wear a little thin. Also, the contrived love triangle is a little irritating. I think the story could have probably done without it altogether. The only strong female happens to be one of the villians.Ethan Burke, the town sheriff, manages to get the together by staging an execution where everyone participates. Instead of proceeding with the execution, Burke, let's the cat out of the bag by telling the townspeople the truth about their situation in Wayward Pines. Pilcher, the man who built the town and brought the people there, shuts down the town's protective perimeter to punish the town. Monsters called \"aberrations\" (Abby for short) live in great numbers in the forest surrounding the town. The Abby's are ape like creatures who are intelligent vicious predators who can hunt individually and in organized packs. With the town defenses inoperative, the Abby's come into town to terrorize and kill. Horror and drama ensues....This series is good but not great. I think this partly because I had hard time relating to the characters. It is more of a superficial connection rather than getting into the heads of the characters.

I clapped and felt something exciting going on within my mind. What a pleasurable\u2014but not a sexual\u2014experience. Author Blake Crouch ended the Wayward Pines trilogy perfectly. The beginning of The Last Town skyrockets the already intriguing narrative that was set up in the previous two entries. With its frenetic pace and action pieces galore, this story stays engaging and pulse-pounding nearly the entire time. The specific thing that fascinates me in all of this is that Crouch has left the world wide open. Smart move. With everything that went down in this book and the other two, surprisingly, there's STILL a lot left to uncover. And if he so desired to explore more terrain in the future, I'd be all for it... There is just an unlimited supply of tales to tell within this wondrous world.So if you'd like to, paint on that canvas, Crouch. But please don't think that I'm not completely satisfied with what you've done, because I am. This kicked ass. Lots of it. What happened altogether was a logical, fitting ending. Now I want to watch the TV series. UPDATE: So I've recently watched all of S1 of Wayward Pines and said television series isn't as good (since it's so streamlined), but that's okay. It's serviceable. Just sucked that the three novels were quickly condensed into a ten-episode arc...which didn't even cover a lot of cool stuff from the trilogy, anyway! Oh well. I'm not cranky about it. It is acceptable for what it is. However, the second season is wiggity wack trash. Torturous to watch after just a few episodes have elapsed.P.S. David Pilcher was such a delusional douche! But he's way more of an asshole in the novels. Read these/those first and foremost. The neutered show can wait on the bench.Let me leave you all with something funny.Here's a shining (and entertaining) example of Pilcher's douchey dialogue: \n\"I created a paradise for you.

No spoliers but after the reader had spent two books with key residents of Wayward Pines Crouch certainly uses his excellent characterization to good effect.We as the reader are reminded what a flawed and three dimensional hero Ethan Burke is throughout the series.also I'm a little ashamed to admit that it wasn't until reading The Last Town that some of the themes clicked.
