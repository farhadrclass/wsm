The foundation of her novel is based on the legend of Katie Wyler, an 18th century settler, captured and held by the Shawnee until she escaped and walked miles and miles home (roughly from Morgantown to Ashville)in hopes of reconnecting with her people. McCrumb juxtaposes this tale with several characters who live in Appalachia in the late 20th Century. Each contemporary tale expands and elevates the themes of the legend, showing how people today \"walk these hills,\" still struggling with many of the same hardships and sorrows as Katie.McCrumb uses research and her insider's knowledge of Appalachia to create a novel that conveys some of the complexities of this region's landscape and heritage. She imbeds these facts within a compelling mystery--actually five mysteries: one about Katie, one about Harm, one about Rita, one about Martha, and one about Sabrina. By the end of the novel, McCrumb reveals startling secrets about each of these five characters, each secret making sense within the subsequent attitudes and behaviors in their own lives but also showing connecting themes with several others' lives--and with the landscape as well. On the surface, this book looks like pulp fiction, but if you look closely at this book, like cabin in the holler, it's adorned with remarkable craftmanship."}, {"userName": "Rachel Weingarten", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/749050-rachel-weingarten", "userReview": "I'll admit to having been disappointed when McCrumb segued into her NASCAR books, but understand the desire to evolve.

Either the alcohol or the confinement, mostly likely both, has got him confused about where - and when - he is. But not so confused that he couldn't escape and start heading for the only home he's ever known, in the country hills of Tennessee.But much more time has passed than Harm realizes. His beautiful wife and baby daughter are almost 40 years older. The land has changed. And Harm himself has changed too.His wife, remarried now to a 'respectable' sort of man, isn't afraid of him at all. But local law enforcement don't know whether to take his disappearance as a joke or a menace. They've got other things to deal with, like patrolling high school football games, dealing with domestic disputes, and personnel issues. And then some graduate student gets a goofy idea to trace the footsteps of a long-lost pioneer woman who escaped her Indian captors and made her way back home. His effort might have been helped if he hadn't packed everything he might possibly have needed and bought brand new hiking boots before he left.I loved the way McCrumb wove all these separate strands into a rich and moving story. It really helped that I have seen this land, and hiked (OK, not for long!) along a part of the trail, and seen what the land has to offer. Poetic and tragic and suspenseful all at the same time. 5 stars."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5841287-linda", "userReview": "There are more people walking the woods of these hills than coyotes howling at the moon. Having walked some of the trails in the Appalachian Mountain region of our great country, it was a treat to recall my own appreciation for the beauty of this land. This story covers three different time periods. The ghost of Katie Wyler, a pioneer woman is from the late 1700's. We have Hiram (Harm) Sorley, a 65 year old escaped convict who's memory is stuck in the 1960's. Then comes present day with Jeremy Cobb, a university professor who is determined to retrace the Katie Wyler escape from the Indians route. Hank the Yank adds humor as a local DJ originating from \"up north way\".Thats the short list of a most memorable cast of characters. There are many, But you'll have no trouble keeping them all straight because the author has done an exemplary job of writing this story. I always find that I am never disappointed when I pick up a book about mountain people. The folklore of these uncomplicated people who would rather live poor and free than become \"prosperous\" in the lowlands of the big cities delivers a satisfying, often educational read. It is a return to when living close to the land held true meaning. I really liked this book. It's my first by this author, I'll seek out more in the future."}, {"userName": "Sez\u00edn Koehler", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/304310-sez-n-koehler", "userReview": "An absolutely charming story about Appalachia, weaving history together with the present and giving a gorgeous portrait of life in one of the oldest and untouched parts of America."}, {"userName": "Jessi", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2838930-jessi", "userReview": "This was an alright story. It is about many different people in a small town in the Appalations(sp?) and their connection to each other. There is an elderly escaped convict, a middle aged woman dispatcher who wants to be a deputy(and feels the need to explain this on every friggen level), a history Student who tries to walk the 200 year old trail of a girl who escaped the indians and maybe a ghost. There is also a of a radio dj(who really bugged me, but I don't like radio dj's so thats a Jessi thing I guess) who tries to solve an old murder case. All these story interconnect and I found the author did a great job of going from storyline to storyline.But there was not one character I liked not one, they were well developed but I was not interested in them in the least,some I found pathetic, others I could not follow their motivations for anything. The reason I gave this 3 stars instead of 2 is the description of the land itself was perfect and maybe I enjoyed it more then usual because of my dislike for anyone in the book,but the mountains,forsets and the highways,McCrumb painted a fantastic picture of the setting and that is what kept me going through this one."}, {"userName": "Andrea", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/845149-andrea", "userReview": "I originally read this as the Common Book for my freshman year in college. At the time, I was unimpressed in part because we read from a copy with a typical \"supermarket\" format that guided my expectations before I ever opened the book. To be honest, watching and hearing about McCrumb's interactions with people on campus didn't help.I recently read another of her books at the recommendation of a colleague and came back to this one because it seemed to fit some themes for a course I'll be teaching this fall. As I might have expected, it's much better than my eighteen-year-old self thought. The characters are convincing, the plots are well-woven, and the novel takes up themes that continue to be significant in a number of ways.

In my opinion, this statement could not be further from the truth. In no sense did I find it terrifying. A ghostly apparition was mentioned a handful of times in passing, but nothing even remotely scary came of it. In short, I was expecting a frightening ghost story. Instead, I got a crime fiction... and a very good one! I found She Walks These Hills to be a captivating story that I couldn't help but continue reading, even if it was 3:00 am and I was tired out of my wits. A great story, but nevertheless somewhat of a misrepresentation: If you want a haunting ghost story that terrifies you to the point of not being able to fall asleep, She Walks These Hills is not what you're looking for. If you're looking for a good, original crime fiction novel, then it's right up your alley."}, {"userName": "Andy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1583456-andy", "userReview": "The strength of this book is the author's obvious knowledge, and love for, Appalachia. Her vivid descriptions of the mountains and hollers, and her engrossing characters make you feel as if you've stepped out of your home and into a small town, deep in the mountains. I truly enjoyed getting to know the folks in Dark Hollow, Tennessee. (Particularly the DJ, \"Hank the Yank\" - he made me laugh out loud!)I give the book only 3 stars because the author's use of point of view during the story was not my favorite - you may feel differently. Also, I had trouble with the character \"Martha.\" She seemed to change too drastically to be believable - perhaps if I experienced what she experienced I would change that way too...?If you like Appalachian stories, I recommend this one for light, summer reading."}, {"userName": "Debbie Maskus", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2486098-debbie-maskus", "userReview": "An interesting story set in the Tennessee/North Carolina mountains about mountain living. I really liked the parallel stories of the young woman escaping from Indians in 1700's and the 60+ prison escapee. The story has many memorable characters which interweave into the main story. The few pages about the honor student who kills himself after a football game ties into the mountain mentality. The traditions concerning death, love, and life seem silly, but are essential to survival.

When I first finished it this morning, I was on my way to another book club. I rated it 4 stars and didn't have time to write this actual review. So between then and now, I've changed my mind and decided that I loved the book and had to up my stars to 5. This is the 3rd book in this series and I hate to read out of order but I didn't have time to read the first two prior to this one so I don't know if there are repeating characters and/or additional background that might have had an impact on my opinions. I just know that I truly loved the way Ms. McCrumb presented the folks in this tale, whether born and bred hillbillies or wealthy town residents. Harm Sorley is 63 year old man who has been in prison for 30 some years for killing a man with an ax. He suffers from Korsakoff's syndrome which means his memory is gone and he believes he's still a young man with a wife and a baby girl. He manages to escape from the prison and is making his way home. When the residents of his area of the mountain realize that a \"killer\" is on the loose, they start over-reacting while the local radio host is selling bumper stickers to fund a legal defense for Harm. Harm's ex-wife is now living in a beautiful home with her new husband who doesn't want anyone to know of her \"hillbilly\" origins. His daughter is now a successful geologist. While all of this is going on, a young historian has decided to retrace the trail of Katie Wyler who was kidnapped by Indians in 1779 but was able to escape and find her way home. By the end of the book half a dozen residents from the area were roaming around in the wilds of the Appalachians for one reason and another. I thought the author did a great job of creating the proper atmosphere for this story, fleshing out the characters and keeping the reader turning pages. I just thought this was a great read and I look forward to reading the rest of the series."}, {"userName": "Danna", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/637121-danna", "userReview": "A number of books on my currently-reading list are en route to the library I use, so I picked this one up off my snack pile to read in the mean time. (Snack pile: a stack of second-hand books I haven't read yet that seem like entertaining quick-reads.) Noticing other Goodreads reviews, I was intrigued and did a bit of digging online. Behold the power of learning more about the thing you're reading: http://www.sharynmccrumb.com. Knowing the author's motives and the intent behind her stories has inspired me to pay more attention to this book and has bumped it up a notch on my Snack Scale... [This part has been edited now that I've finished it. I thought the characters were two-dimensional, the relationship drama particularly irritating, and the plot predictable. And yet I read the whole thing, turning pages like eating potato chips. Back now to the babbling about other mystery authors.]Nevada Barr's books are action-adventure murder mysteries in which the main character is a female park ranger, and each book takes place in a different National Park. The plot formula isn't unique, but I enjoy her sense of place and her obvious love for the Park system despite its many flaws, which I'm glad she's unafraid to address. While I'm yammering on about mysteries here: I'm not overly fond of what might be called \"traditional whodunits\" (ie: Agatha Christie) but I adore Anne Perry's Inspector Monk series, set in 1850's England. Absolutely engaging! I'd rank her right up there with Ms. Christie in talent. (Add to that her morbidly fascinating past; Peter Jackson's \"Heavenly Creatures\" was based on her childhood.) Barbara Hambly (at first a writer of fantasy and vampire novels that were oh so popular when I was in high school) has a good historical-mystery series about Benjamin January, \"A Free Man of Color\" (as the first book is titled), set in 1830's New Orleans."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9223344-lisa", "userReview": "A friend loaned me this book as it takes place in a fictional Tennessee town (Hamelin) on the border of North Carolina (Asheville--a real place!) where we will soon be moving. I really enjoyed the book and found myself up late into night reading the next chapter (and then the next). To me that is a sign of good fiction. The book tells the story of a small town filled with many mountain people (referred to as hillbillies in the book) who have their own legends and customs. The mountain person culture clashes with the other characters--a deputy, the sheriff, a graduate student from Virginia Tech, and Connecticut transplant radio personality--as they all try to find an escaped convince (a 63 year old mountain person with some form of dementia referred to in the book as Korsakoff's Syndrome).There are many subplots that develop along the way and ring true to life (the graduate student who is trying to forget her\"hillbilly roots,\" the struggling female dispatcher who wants to better herself in a sexist workplace and finds out her boyfriend is cheating on her, the Connecticut radio transplant who has no understanding of the south or the culture he lives in). There are many sympathetic characters and most characters in the book stumble along trying to do the right thing. Of course there is a murder and some mysticism thrown in (so not everyone is good in this book). I got the biggest kick out of the naive Virginia Tech graduate student hiking through the mountains completely unprepared in order to obtain research for his dissentation. As a college professor I could relate to his plight (hopefully I'm not that naive, but you never know). I recommend this book as a work of light fiction that transports you to a different culture (Appalachia) with some solid characters."}, {"userName": "Dee", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1957346-dee", "userReview": "I wanted to read a book by Sharyn McCrumb because I met her years ago and liked her.This book is set in Appalachian country.

The old, wise mountain woman, Nora Bonesteel, who had \"the sight\" was a really interesting character.

The men are mostly baffled, misled or self-deluded by their machismo. The exception being Sheriff Spencer Arrowood, who is clear and consistent and humble enough. \"Follow the River\" by Thom has long been one of my favorite books, and this member of McCrumb's 'Ballad' series honors it by using some of Mary Draper Ingles story to flesh out the specter of Katie Wyler. The 'Ballad' novels blend the mundane and supernatural worlds through the intermediary of Nora Bonsteel, a modern day senior with 'the sight'. So there are many stories wrapped into one package which is neatly tied up by the story's conclusion.

It reminds me of incremental repetition in ballads - how verses repeat with a couple words or details changed each time.
