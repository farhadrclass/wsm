I must admit though, that there is something about her poetry that is very powerful, albeit disturbing. It is full of animals that slink, bodies that are mutilated or raped, attacked by suffering, old age, death and decay. Natural forces like sun, wind, water and fire threaten and invade. People and memories fade but refuse to disappear. The poems are tinged with violence, protest, sex, regret, nostalgia, wisdom, cynicism. Atwood's voice is not happy or sweet, but it is articulate and insistent. It demands to be heard and will not submit to being silenced."}, {"userName": "Liisabet", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11702842-liisabet", "userReview": "\"I would like to be the air that inhabits you for a moment only.

Her poems took root in fertile soil and flourished.Eating Fire, is actually three collections of poems; Poems 1965-1975, Poems 1976-1886 and Morning in the Burned House. I own all three independently, but this is the book, the collection, I drag around with me in my bag.These are the poems I read when I feel dry, when I am not sure what a poet's voice sounds like, or what a poem looks like. It also doesn't hurt that Atwood is a kinswoman, a Canadian. When I have felt adrift, her poems have been my roots.Consider the following excerpt.Notes Towards A Poem That Can Never Be WritteniThis is the placeyou would rather not know about,this is the place that will inhabit you,this is the place you cannot imagine,this is the place that will finally defeat youwhere the word why shrivels and emptiesitself. This is famine.There is no famine in this collection. There is much to love in this book, so I will limit myself to a couple of poems I love. I *LOVE* Half Hanged Mary, and all the snake poems, but especially Psalm to a Snake. Oh and the above Notes Towards A Poem That Can Never Be Written... hmmm ... and Power Politics ... and, and, and ....I am by no means an unbiased reviewer - more a passionate follower.If you haven't .... do."}, {"userName": "Ashleigh", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2252703-ashleigh", "userReview": "Okay, this is probably the first proper poetry book I've read & I quite enjoyed it. I'm still a girl who was in firm belief that poetry should rhyme, I still find it quite hard to grip poetry that doesn't but I really enjoyed this book, I really did.There were a few that stood out to me, that I really, really loved. What they were I can't remember as I forgot to note them down. I do, however, remember loving Red Shirt - and to be honest all of the poems from that 1978 era. I also really loved the Snake Poems and Interlunar. I loved the Orpheus & Eurydice poems. I really liked the poetry/prose things she had going on. I found them really pleasant to break up the 'real' poetry, if you see what I mean?Overall it was a 3/5 - there were many I just couldn't connect with but it was on the whole pretty good ^_^"}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17527836-diane", "userReview": "I was given this book many years ago, already well thumbed, long before I discovered the delights of Atwood's novels.
