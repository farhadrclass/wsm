The second In the Company of Killers book exceeded all my expectations! Any more, I don\u2019t expect second books to be as good as the first. I\u2019ve just been let down too many times by sequels lately. I am happy to report that this was just as good as the first book for me! Sarai has been trying to live a normal life for a while now. But it\u2019s not working for her. She can\u2019t just go on living a \u2018normal\u2019 life knowing whats out there. There are people, terrible people who need to be stopped. She needs to stop them the only way she knows how. By killing them. She\u2019s on a mission. She\u2019s going after Hamburg and she won\u2019t be deterred. Victor has been keeping tabs on Sarai. He knows what she\u2019s up to and he knows she is in way over her head. So what does he do? He goes in rescue mode. Sarai turns him into a different man. Someone who cares. He cares about her, her well being, her safety. The last thing he wants is to have her end up hurt or worse. Sarai will always hold a special place to him. She is possibly the only person he\u2019s ever let in his heart. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what this is between us, but I am sure that I don\u2019t want it to stop. Whatever it is.\u201d\n\u2028Life without Victor hasn\u2019t been the same for Sarai. She misses him, wants him, needs him. Moving on from him has been near impossible. \nEvery hour of every day, I thought about you. Only you, Victor. I lived every single day with hope, believing in my heart that you were going to come back.\n\u2028I love them together. They compliment each other. Their passion and intensity really show. They are more alike than either cares to admit, and they just fit. \nVictor wants a better life for Sarai than his. But this is the path she\u2019s chosen. She wants revenge, justice for those wronged. He knows she won\u2019t stop, so he does the only thing he can think. He helps her. He trains her. He brings her into his fold. Along with Fredrik (oh I just love him), they try to prepare Sarai for her kill. Along with her training, Sarai will be tested. Will she be able to pass the test, or will it break her resolve? Sarai/Izabel proved herself in this book. Her strength, determination, and killer instincts. She went through so much, she carried herself well no matter what the situation. Some of the things she went through were insane. Victor is my favorite killer ever. Sarai isn\u2019t the only one who proves herself in this book. Victor proves he is more than just a killer. He has a caring, protective, loving side (at leas when it comes to Sarai). It\u2019s great to see that both of these characters have more than one side, they are so complex. \nI love a good dark read. Reading a book that captures my attention and keeps me enthralled the entire time I\u2019m reading it. This series has done that. It takes the \u2018bad guys\u2019 and turns them into heros. The plot is fast paced. There is never a dull moment. I found myself flying through this one, unable to put it down once I started. I give it a solid 5 stars, just like the first. I can\u2019t tell you how excited I am to get a Fredrik book! I think I may love him even more than Victor... Either way, if you\u2019re looking for a fast paced, action packed read, with some killing, sexy times, and even a few sweet scenes, this is the read for you!"}, {"userName": "\u10e6Flo\u10e6 the coffee addict", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7643503-flo-the-coffee-addict", "userReview": "5 **hells yeah** STARS\n\n\u201cFor the record, I\u2019m not just sleeping with an assassin. I\u2019ve grown very attached to one.\u201d\n\nALL TIME FAVOURITE BOOKS RIGHT HERE, LADIES!! Feels like this series was written for me. I'm so happy right now, I could cry. Seriously, I\u2019m so mad at myself for not reading this earlier. But let\u2019s rewind and talk about the book. Reviving Izabel is the second instalment In the Company of Killers Series and picks up six months after Killing Sarai ended. Victor and Sarai have gone on their different ways, forced to deal with the fallout of their past actions in their own particular ways.\n\n\u201cSeems we were made for each other, like two puzzle pieces that at first don\u2019t appear to fit, but eventually fall into place when looked at in the most unlikely of angles.\u201d\n\nSarai lives in Arizona together with Mrs. Gregory trying to lead an average life; with friends, a job and even a very normal boyfriend. But try as she might her past shaped her a lot more than she had anticipated. There are just too many unsettled scores. Long story short, she wants to kill Hamburg. And she goes about it in a reckless and very dangerous way.Victor Faust is in hot water. He left the Order and is now a wanted man. On top of his efforts to survive and figuring out who to trust, he is faced with Sarai\u2019s less than smart decision making. And staying away from her is impossible once she lands herself in mortal danger. So what is left is deciding if he wants to train her to become like him, or not. Because leaving Sarai on her own is out of the question now that they are hunted not only by the order but also Hamburg and his men.\n\n\u201cStaying one step ahead of death, it is our way of life. It is my way of life, and I believe it was always meant to be this way. But as strange as it may seem, I feel perfectly safe in the company of killers.\u201d\n\nOh this series. What can I tell you? These are exceptional characters in extraordinary situations. They are killers. Plain and simple. They embrace who they are. No shame or guilt. Every kind of moral compass we would normally use to guide our actions is completely irrelevant for Victor, Sarai, Niklas and Fredrik. Which in return makes this such an entertaining and addictive read. Talking about escapism. Now imagine on top of that a romantic relationship. Victor and Sarai are like two sides of the same very dysfunctional and very ruthless coin. I love them. All in all, a splendid sequel. Action packed, mysterious and twisted. I'm well on my way to read the series within one week. Time well spent."}, {"userName": "Aestas Book Blog", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5604583-aestas-book-blog", "userReview": "NEW COVER & SIGNED GIVEAWAY!!! This is the sequel to  Killing Sarai !SIGNED GIVEAWAY --> http://aestasbookblog.com/in-the-comp...BLURB -->  Determined to live a dark life in the company of the assassin who freed her from bondage, Sarai sets out on her own to settle a score with an evil sadist. Unskilled and untrained in the art of killing, the events that unfold leave her hanging precariously on the edge of death when nothing goes as planned. Victor Faust finds her in time enough to help her, but not in time to save those who Sarai has grown to care about.After what she has done, Sarai\u2019s fear of leading killers to Mrs. Gregory\u2019s doorstep sends her on a path she knows she can never turn back from. She presents Victor with an ultimatum: help her become more like him and give her a fighting chance, or she\u2019ll do it alone no matter the consequences.Victor, as cold-blooded and seemingly emotionless as always, still has a soft spot for Sarai and knows that he probably always will. He will not let her die if he can help it, so he inevitably agrees to train her. But what Sarai doesn\u2019t know is that her ultimatum has little bearing on his decision. Victor wants to train her. He wants her in his life. And while he struggles with his feelings for her, their complicated relationship heats up and the walls of his caged emotions begin to chip away.Knowing that Sarai cannot become what she wants to be overnight, Victor teaches her what he can in what little time they have. As Arthur Hamburg\u2019s right-hand man, Willem Stephens, closes in on his crusade to kill Sarai, Sarai is left with the crushing realization that she may have bitten off more than she can chew. But Sarai, taking on the new and improved role of Izabel Seyfried, still has a set of deadly skills of her own that will prove to be all she needs to secure her place beside Victor.But there is one test that Izabel must face that has the potential to destroy everything she is working so hard to achieve. One final test that will not only make her question her decision to want this dangerous life, but will make her question everything she has come to trust about Victor Faust."}, {"userName": "Pearl Angeli", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31514572-pearl-angeli", "userReview": "5 Stars!You can never go wrong with J.A. Redmerski! This sequel was a tough one but she handled it perfectly well.The series continues with so much bad-assery. Sarai, or rather Izabel, is now pursuing a different path in life after realizing that a 'normal' life isn't for her. She wants justice and vengeance and to be able to attain those, she must join Victor in his dangerous missions. In this sequel we meet a new character-- Fredrik Gustavsson. Equally hot and dangerous and a new assassin to fangirl over!As the series continues, the story gets even better! I enjoyed this sequel so much because of how the author delivered such a fast, exciting pacing and how she plotted those blood-curling action scenes. There were even morbid scenes that made me cringe... but that's how I like it. Even the characters became more interesting and very well developed, especially Izabel. What a kick-ass woman! I loved her even better here because even if she made some reckless decisions, she was no longer helpless and vulnerable. She's deadlier!\n\n\"She is the perfect liar and manipulator. She can become someone else in two seconds flat and deceive an entire room of people who are not likely to be deceived by anyone. She can make a man believe anything she wants with very little effort. And she doesn't fear death.\"\n\nThe romance was especially hot and so much better than the first book and it's because we can see a different side of Victor here. His softer side. \n\n\"It's in Victor's eyes that I see so much more. An everlasting bond between us not created by this moment, but by the night we crossed paths in Mexico. Thrust into each other's lives by a twist of fate and held there by our rare similarities and our need to be together. We are one in the same.\"\n\nAll in all, Reviving Izabel was a great follow-up to Killing Sarai. So many thrilling, action-packed scenes that will leave you gasping. You can't just miss this sequel after reading Killing Sarai!"}, {"userName": "Jacqueline's Reads", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4197769-jacqueline-s-reads", "userReview": "5 I\u2019m in Love with Victor Faust Stars#1 - KILLING SARAI - > Victor and Sarai\u2019s Story#2 - REVIVING IZABEL \u2013 > Continues Victor and Sarai\u2019s Story#3 - THE SWAN & THE JACKAL - > Fredrik and Cassia\u2019s Story.

I love In The Company of Killers series. It\u2019s so raw, gritty, dramatic, gut wrenching and twisted. J.A. Redmerski knows how to write a good story and I love the emotions she makes me feel as I read.I felt a lot of things when I was listening to Reviving Izabel. I knew what was going to happen, but listening to books just makes you feel everything for the first time again. I felt for Sarai and her issues, I felt for her need to find acceptance and be okay with Victor gone. I felt her pain and her need to put other people before her and I felt Victor\u2019s indifference. Reviving Izabel picks up a little after where Killing Sarai left off. Sarai is trying to put the pieces of her life back together. She understands why Victor left her, but it doesn\u2019t make it any easier on her heart. To my surprise, she found a boyfriend (hey a girl gots needs), this hurt my heart a little, because I\u2019ll be honest, Victor is my book boyfriend and it felt like a betrayal, but a girl is got to do what a girl got to do. She\u2019s trying to live the \u201cnormal\u201d life, but she is nothing but normal. She realizes she won\u2019t be at peace until she gets revenge and even though she has little training, she tries to do it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not just sleeping with an assassin. I\u2019ve grown very attached to one.\u201d\u201cWhen he touches me I know what he's thinking, how he truly feels beneath that mask he wears in the face of others.\u201d\n\nI love how much Sarai has changed. She\u2019s always been strong, confident and caring, but she\u2019s like this fierce warrior in Reviving Izabel. It\u2019s so refreshing, talk about girl power. The dynamics between Victor and Sarai is VERY intense. I love that Sarai doesn\u2019t throw herself at Victor, but she still has feelings for him. I love Victor. I love how aloof he is and I love that Redmerski made him somewhat vulnerable (just a touch, but it\u2019s enough). Yes, you will see a different side of Victor and it\u2019s great, fantastic, you will get your panties wet. \n\n\u201call I want to do is pull her against me and hold her until we both die.\u201d\n\nRedmerski incorporates more of the characters you will see in the future books and she provides some backstory. I love that because it really builds the characters and ties everyone together. One of the reasons why I love these kinds of books is because the author doesn\u2019t tell me how to feel, she just makes me feel it. There\u2019s nothing worse than reading a book explaining to me my emotions. I love that Redmerski can write scenes and a story that just pulls me. It\u2019s very addictive. Audio QuestionsWhat made the experience of listening to Reviving Izabel the most enjoyable?J.A. Redmerski wonderful writing made my listening experience the most enjoyable. She knows how to write a story that consumes you, pulls you in and twist your gut. It\u2019s a heart wrenching, yet joyful experience everyone should go through reading a book. What did you like best about this story? See the different side of Victor Faust was the best part of the book. There is nothing better than seeing a Hero with mega issues slightly vulnerable because of a girl. If that doesn\u2019t make you sigh then your heart is made of stone.Have you listened to any of Stephen Bel Davies and Kate Reinders \u2019s other performances before? How does this one compare? I love audio re-reading. I did the audio version of Killing Sarai so I am experienced to Kate and Stephen\u2019s voices. I\u2019m a fan of Kate. I love her sweet, young and youthful sounding voice. She sounds like the Sarai I envisioned in my head and she did a standup job.Stephen\u2019s voice is older than I expected. I know Victor is suppose to be older, let\u2019s just say I had to get use to Stephen\u2019s voice. I love Victor as a character so much, eventually it got better.If you were to make a film of this book, what would the tag line be? I hate this question because I can never think of anything witty or cool to say, so I\u2019ll just say this.Fantastic read, another instant hit by Redmerski.

I already loved the previous book in this series and it doesn't happen often that the sequel rivals or even outshines the prequel but in this case that's exactly what happened. Told from a dual POV, this sequel is even more riveting, exciting and unputdownable and it made me an even bigger fan of author J.A. Redmerski.Reviving Izabel picks up eight months after everything that transpired at the end of book one. Sarai is trying to build up a normal, violent-less life but when she's once again confronted with Arthur Hamburg she decides to take matters into her own hands and she hunts him down. When circumstances bring Victor back into her life though, she realizes how much she still needs his help and when he decides to help her, their feelings start to reignite.\n\n\"The largest part of me, the flawed human part, wants her with me and I'll stop at nothing to make sure that it works.\"\n\nThere is never a dull moment in the lives of Sarai Cohen/Izabel Seyfried and Victor Faust, that's for sure. The entire book kept me on the edge of my seat and the way the book evolved was never predictable or uneventful.Sarai is a unique, very likable heroine with an incredibly strong, tough as nails personality. Throughout the story she evolves from an innocent, naive victim to a fervent, determined killer. She still has a lot to learn but she's willing to do whatever it takes to become a worthy partner to Victor. Victor on the other hand is still the same old ruthless assassin with an impenetrable wall around his heart. Except when it comes to Sarai. Together they're the perfect match.\n\n \"Sarai and I kill for different reasons, we are driven by very different needs, but in the end we are both killers and I know that will never change. We can't come back from that, and most who kill more than once, don't want to.\"\n\nAll in all, this book had the perfect build up, interesting character development and an even better ending. This series and the characters in it will definitely stay with me forever and I can't wait to read more about the fascinatingly dark side-character Fredrik (and hopefully a little more Victor and Sarai).\n\"Staying one step ahead of death, it is our way of life. It is my way of life, and I believe it was always meant to be this way.

Bwahaha! Still, we'll never know because J.A. Redmerski loves unpredictable, mini-heart attack kind of plot twists. I'm dying to see the real Vonnegut too. That sneaky bastard.------------------------------First read: January 2016\n\"In our kind of life sometimes terrible things must be done to those we love to clear a path of new beginnings.\"\nSarai Cohen or Izabel Seyfried tried to lived a 'normal' life for 8 months without Victor Faust. Now that she got a chance to live freely, it seems that this 'normal' life isn't what she craves. She wants to be an assassin. With such recklessness and lack of skills, she almost died of going after Hamburg and puts her life at stake as his men are hunting for her.\n\n\"Sarai's vengeful bloodlust runs deeper than I knew, deeper than she let on to me.\"\n\nVictor develops his feelings toward Sarai. Deep down, he cares for this woman and will do anything to keep her safe. However, Sarai doesn't want him to always save her life. She insist him to train her so she can defend/fight for herself, kill abusive men and also fight alongside with him. She knows it's not going to be easy and she's determined to enter a dangerous life. All of these tests ahead of her will make her an assassin. She must trust her instincts and not to trust anyone unless proven can be trusted. The final test she has to endure... will truly test her trust and decision. This sequel is superb. It may be less intense than Killing Sarai BUT there's more action and violence (it's still intense, it's just that Killing Sarai is more intense to me.) I love how it focuses on Izabel's character as she gets stronger, bolder and better. It's truly one of the best character developments ever. Izabel Seyfried is a badass woman. The romance between Victor and Izabel is SCORCHING HOT. Damn! These two.. OMFG. Victor may be a brooding, deadly assassin but there's so much more to him. I love how he opens up his true feelings that he's deprived of. My heart melts for them. I swoon over for Victor Faust.Before you dive into this series, you better brace yourself because it's really a  dark, twisted and suspenseful story. There are some parts that might make you cringe and put you out of your comfort zone. That depends on you. I must say this series is worth the try because it keeps getting better and better.  The premise is really good, the plot twists will keep you surprised and more characters are involved like Fredrik Gustavsson - Master of brutality! He really made me curious but he's scary af. I'm going to read the next book to know more about him. What a beautiful bloody sequel. I'm now addicted with this series (and to assassins). Definitely a must read series! I love everything about it! \n\n\"Staying one step ahead of death, it is our way of life. It is my way of life, and I believe it was always meant to be this way.

Some of it is a bit shocking!\u2725 And we have a softer Victor...for the most part. I loved his awkwardness and sweetness and his humor! One thing I do know is that I didn't care for what the colder Victor did at the end...even if it was necessary.\u2725 I was a bit disappointed at the reunion. I guess I was wanting more of a struggle. It felt like things resolved too easily.\u2725 Thankfully, we do get some sex scenes. I'm really not going to complain even if they weren't that steamy.

We don't even know anything about him but I already want to know more...much more! ;) \u2725 And while it did seem like Victor and Izabel's story is somewhat complete (I'm sure there will be more ongoing things), I've heard there will be two more books with the next one being about Fredrik called, The Swan & The Jackal (sounds intriguing!).

She's dating a douche bag who is screwing her BFF and for some reason she thinks its a good idea to go to California and that she is bad-ass enough to kill Hamburg herself.But instead its more like she's lucky she made it out alive....And then here comes Victor to save her ass.\nHe apparently has missed her and been keeping tabs on her since they last parted ways. He admits his feelings and that he wants her to stay with him and train if she really wants to be \"in\" and kill. She says yes so starts her training.Throughout the whole book I struggled with the believability of how hardcore Sarai was.  It did get better towards the end and maybe I'm just jealous becauseAnyways there were some twists and I was surprised that those involved.

Whatever it is.\u201d\nVictor Faust owns my heart!!!!!!!!The second installment of In the Company of Killers was JUST as good as the first. Fast paced, full of drama, action, and steamy scenes. And I loved every freaking second of it.Without giving up too much plot detail, especially if you haven't read the first, Reviving Izabel picks up where Killing Sarai left off. Victor wants Sarai to try and live a normal life. But Sarai wants nothing to do with 'normalcy.' So instead, Victor, along with the help of Fredrik (who I LOVE by the way), helps train Sarai to become who she really wants to be. Which in this case is a killer, out for revenge on those who have wronged her.But along the way, Sarai is tested. And everyone's trust is tested to weed out who is loyal, and who isn't. I just need to point out that I am utterly obsessed with Victor and Sarai's connection. Their banter, the way the feel for one another, their thoughts, made me completely melt. There is nothing I love more than when a stone cold man breaks for a girl. The way Victor feels for Sarai is something that just leaps off the pages and kicks you right in the feels! \n\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d he asks and his mouth sweeps mine again. \u201cNo, I\u2026I just didn\u2019t expect this.\u201d\u201cExpect what?\u201d I feel his fingers fit behind the elastic of my panties.

Sarai is struggling with her life the way it is...She just doesn't do \"normal.\" Deep down now that she has had the taste of killing, she knows she is more comfortable in the lifestyle of a killer than going to night clubs with friends. She also has some unresolved issues regarding an evil man that she most certainly wants dead. So, she decides to \"Revive\" her alter ego Izabel and goes for the kill. Unfortunately, she doesn't think her actions through very well, and as a result some dire consequences happen. Victor has been aware of Sarai's actions, and he goes ends up reunited with her to help save herself from the mess she has caused. Sarai realizes she bit off far more than she can chew and she begs Victor to train her to become a lethal killer like him. Once these two join forces there is no stopping them. Nothing is ever easy though, and there are enemies at every turn; not to mention some major betrayals too.This story kept me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end! Yes, there is some sex and a bit of romance in this series; but it is so much more than that too. It is on the dark side too, and sometimes situations tend to be somewhat gruesome. After all, the characters in this series are all killers. It is quite a unique series, unlike anything I have read before. Somehow, JA Redmerski is able to draw my compassion out for these not so angelic characters. They all have their flaws; but most have a rough back story which does help explain why they are the way they are. I am officially hooked on this series, and I can't wait to see what Fredrick's book is going to play out. He is a sadistic monster and yet there is a vulnerable side to him that I am dying to see come out! I am so glad I finally picked this series up, and I urge anyone who has been intrigued by it to do the same!!!

I really love this series and I love that it is an actual series and not a trilogy. This book marks the end of Victor and Izabel's story, but from what I can tell, they'll pretty much be side characters in the following books. Overall, I really enjoyed this book. I knocked a star of because Izabel had me rolling my eyes a couple times and then I felt the summarized ending was rushed. I know it was a summary, but... I don't know. I was kind of disappointed. Even if it did set up the story for these characters for future books. I really recommend this series if you're looking for an action/assassin/romance Mr. & Mrs. Smith-styled book!"}, {"userName": "Maddie ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55751376-maddie", "userReview": "https://bookmonstersblog.com/Will do review later"}, {"userName": "Christine Wallflower & Dark Romance Junkie ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11641363-christine-wallflower-dark-romance-junkie", "userReview": "I just read the blurb!!! And WOWZA!!!Determined to live a dark life in the company of the assassin who freed her from bondage, Sarai sets out on her own to settle a score with an evil sadist. Unskilled and untrained in the art of killing, the events that unfold leave her hanging precariously on the edge of death when nothing goes as planned. Victor Faust finds her in time enough to help her, but not in time to save those who Sarai has grown to care about.After what she has done, Sarai\u2019s fear of leading killers to Mrs. Gregory\u2019s doorstep sends her on a path she knows she can never turn back from. She presents Victor with an ultimatum: help her become more like him and give her a fighting chance, or she\u2019ll do it alone no matter the consequences.Victor, as cold-blooded and seemingly emotionless as always, still has a soft spot for Sarai and knows that he probably always will. He will not let her die if he can help it, so he inevitably agrees to train her. But what Sarai doesn\u2019t know is that her ultimatum has little bearing on his decision. Victor wants to train her. He wants her in his life. And while he struggles with his feelings for her, their complicated relationship heats up and the walls of his caged emotions begin to chip away.Knowing that Sarai cannot become what she wants to be overnight, Victor teaches her what he can in what little time they have. As Arthur Hamburg\u2019s right-hand man, Willem Stephens, closes in on his crusade to kill Sarai, Sarai is left with the crushing realization that she may have bitten off more than she can chew. But Sarai, taking on the new and improved role of Izabel Seyfried, still has a set of deadly skills of her own that will prove to be all she needs to secure her place beside Victor.But there is one test that Izabel must face that has the potential to destroy everything she is working so hard to achieve. One final test that will not only make her question her decision to want this dangerous life, but will make her question everything she has come to trust about Victor Faust.Off course I'm ready for this book dear author!!!I can't wait!!!!"}, {"userName": "\u2765Lil", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14097794-lil", "userReview": "*****5+ Victor Faust stars***** Enough said."}], "description": "-Reading Order-#1 - KILLING SARAI#2 - REVIVING IZABEL#3 - THE SWAN & THE JACKAL#4 - SEEDS OF INIQUITY#5 - THE BLACK WOLF#6 - BEHIND THE HANDS THAT KILL#7 - SPIDERS IN THE GROVE---Determined to live a dark life in the company of the assassin who freed her from bondage, Sarai sets out on her own to settle a score with an evil sadist.
