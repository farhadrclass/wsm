Wacky yet realistic and funny and fun to read.

I had been unsure of what to give this book in terms of rating and review, since I couldn't decide if I liked it or not. As for the art, this graphic novel had beautiful illustrations. It was vibrant, and I liked how the emotions of the characters could be seen in the illustrations itself. The art deserved 4.25/5 stars. However, I had mixed feelings about the story. I think this was because the latter part was interesting but also depressing (in a way). I think that the book would have been better if provided with more pages and more story. Overall, I had mixed feeling about this book. But I had decided to give it 3.5/5 stars."}, {"userName": "Amy Bird", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11747896-amy-bird", "userReview": "This is really excellent!

His landmark graphic novel, Why I Hate Saturn, is an acknowledged classic of the form. I found You Are Here visually over-saturated, with the cartoonish, extreme violence vulgar and pronounced, diminishing the impact of the story with his seeming stylistic choice to depict such crimes in such a literal way. The graphic novel flip-flops awkwardly from slapstick comedy, satire, romantic comedy, to suspenseful film noir, with shocking scenes of violent horror, but without a cohesive visual language that can encompass this mishmash of genres. His veiled slam of Quentin Tarantino's style of depicting mob environments in cinema, is I'll-advised, given the approach Baker took here I applaud the effort; this man can draw anything. I wish I enjoyed this more than I did. It does not discourage me from seeking out his work in the future, although I will be more mindful of the synopsis of his subsequent works."}, {"userName": "Paul Dinger", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1857158-paul-dinger", "userReview": "From the brillant pen of Why I Hate Saturn comes this masterwork about the horror of getting old. Nolel Coleman has lied about everything in his life to his girlfriend and you just know it will all come out. And it does come completly unravelled. Baker isn't just a great artist, but a keen wordsmith with a wicked sense of sardonic humor. His dialouge is a pleasure to read. Most artists working with their own stories focus on the pictures, not Baker. Rather he fills the drawings with actual life in the form of words. I can't say enough good things about this book. Did I tell you I actually met him once at Comic Con? He called this a labor of love where he didn't release any of the pages until he had too. It shows."}, {"userName": "Justinthunderliger", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/576235-justinthunderliger", "userReview": "I have no idea how something this clever (in premise and initial execution) escaped me for over a decade. The art is early computer aided but with a distinct Disney animated style. The story matches the cartoon hijinx nature of the art for the first 2/3rds. Unfortunately, all of the charm is gone by the final showdown and \"what the??\" epilogue. Perhaps that can be attributed to the reader expecting either a fairy tale ending or a noir-ish downer depending upon which style aspect appealed the most. Instead we're left with an \"um...ok. There that is. I kinda see what you did there.\""}, {"userName": "Rosa", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1913711-rosa", "userReview": "Noel used to be a thief, then he found out people were actually willing to buy his paintings and then became an artist instead. He meets Helen a vegetarian all natural nature girl on a weekend getaway upstate, falls in love with her and stays for a year. Noel goes back home to NYC to sell his place and his lies and his past catch up with him. As one thing after another happens to Noel the reader can't help but laugh in disbelief. I love Baker's illustration style although having all of the text under the boxes is a little bit confusing sometimes."}, {"userName": "Mike Sgier", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5553581-mike-sgier", "userReview": "Another excellent Kyle Baker comic, this one in full color, but still utilizing the technique of keeping the dialogue and text outside of the panels (something I'd like to try sometime with my own comics).
