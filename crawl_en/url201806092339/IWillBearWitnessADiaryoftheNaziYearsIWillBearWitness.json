The pain, fear, anxiety, and frustration come through with a raw clarity that is unnerving.So far I have read only 26 pages, through the entry of July 28, 1933, but already I have several ideas I will look to incorporate into my characters in my novel-in-progress.

You see a lot of diaries and memoirs from the Holocaust/WW2 years, but not much from the mid- to late-1930s and the rise of Hitler. Reading Klemperer's diary, which covers January 1933 through December 1941, you can see how the fascist state gradually chipped away at the rights of Jews, and the Holocaust was accomplished in little baby steps. I can summarize it like this:Jewish civil servants were thrown out of their jobs. Klemperer, a college professor, was forced into early retirement and didn't get a veteran's pension. Non-Jewish maids were prohibited from working in Jewish households. First Aryan civil servants, then all Aryans were forbidden to associate with Jews. Jews had to fill out an inventory of all their assets. Everyone was either leaving the country or trying to get out; many of Klemperer's Jewish friends left for places as far away as South America. Kristallnacht happened; the synagogues burned. Jews were no longer permitted to drive. War started, and with it, rations: Jews got smaller rations than Aryans. People who were half Jewish or less could serve in the military, but had limited opportunities for promotion. Jews were no longer allowed to use the library reading room, then they were forbidden to check out library books. There was an earlier curfew for Jews, and they were only allowed to go grocery shopping at certain times of the day. Many stores had \"No Jews Allowed\" signs. Jews were no longer allowed to live in their own homes; Klemperer and his wife had to move into a special \"Jew house\" and rent out their home to a tenant selected by the Nazis. Klemperer committed a minor breach of blackout regulations and served an eight-day jail sentence in solitary confinement; the same offense, committed by an Aryan, would probably have resulted in a 20-mark fine. As the book ended, Klemperer had just gotten out of jail and his typewriter was confiscated; Jews were no longer permitted to have them. And the war has three and a half years left to go!Yet Klemperer was extremely fortunate in a lot of ways. He was very assimilated -- in fact, he had converted to Christianity, after a fashion -- and had a lot of Aryan friends, and most of them remained his friends. His siblings provided much-needed financial support. And his marriage to an Aryan woman would eventually save his life; he was one of the few hundred German Jews who never had to go into hiding and was never deported to a concentration camp.All this he faithfully records, along with the minutae of daily life: his pet cat, building and maintaining his house, learning to drive and buying a lemon that breaks every week, constant dental appointments and general hypochondria, dinner parties, reading, scholarship, sibling rivalry, the weather, etc etc etc.One thing I took note of was, at least from what Klemperer saw, perhaps half the German population sympathized with the Jews. He writes about meeting ardent Nazis and people who try to make his life miserable because of his Jewishness, but more often he notes expressions of sympathy from strangers, shopkeepers slipping forbidden food into his basket, that sort of thing. He even wrote about a \"Star Club,\" a group of Aryans who went around giving friendly greetings to Jews on the street who wore the yellow star, just to show them not everyone hated them. This sort of thing flatly contradicts the theses of a lot of scholars who write books with titles like Hitler's Willing Executioners. The problem was, at least in Klemperer's case, most of the people who sympathized with him did so in a very quiet, unproductive way: they were either too apathetic or too scared to take real action and provide serious, tangible aid. As some wise person once said, all that is needed for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.Victor Klemperer wrote two other diaries, one up to 1945 and the other about the postwar years in Communist East Germany. I hope they are as good as this one; I plan to read them both as soon as I can get my hands on them."}, {"userName": "Audrey", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5171512-audrey", "userReview": "Reviews of this diary consistently fail to account for the richness of its contents. No one should \"rate\" a Holocaust memoir, but my decision to do so reflects my impression of my experience with Klemperer's words as a witness to a place, time, and life at times oddly similar and dissimilar to my own.Klemperer's diary is unique. As an academic, he knows he lives in troubled and interesting times. He leaves the \"facts\" of events in Nazi Germany to historians and focuses on documenting his lived experience and responses to his changing world. As a WWI veteran, a professor, and husband of an Aryan woman, his circumstances and a great deal of Providence, allow him to both remain in Germany (a suburb of Dresden) and survive many of his contemporaries despite his own advanced years.Klemperer's prose provides the reader with more than a window. He might as well be sitting in your room speaking to you. His emotions are palpable eighty years later, and his thoughts almost answer your own questions as soon as they're formed. He knew as he wrote that his actions would have consequences (and prompt serious question)--for more than himself--in the years to come and he is unapologetic and stubborn. He will bear witness, so help him God.Beyond the obvious reason to read this book as a unique account of Nazi Germany, there are important secondary reasons. As an academic, he struggles within the academy-- courses, curriculum, colleagues, petty squabbles, publishing. Timeless. Despite being deprived of a position and seeming impossible odds, Klemperer drags himself out of bed each day and writes, reads, and thinks. Even in a cell, uncertain of seeing his loved ones again, he argues with himself over the success of Hitler's regime in light of known history, considers material for his own work, and creates a puzzle for he and his wife's 37th anniversary (the first ever spent apart). His heart, soul, and mind are his own. His will to stay and chronicle his life, a choice he makes mainly on his own. His words, carefully worded, are his alone. At the same point, he makes concerted and specific mention of the many kindnesses--surprising to us and him--day after day, year after year--that conspire to keep him alive. As a result, we bear witness to the strength not only of his will, but the compassion and love of humankind in the midst of darkness."}, {"userName": "Steph (loves water)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14405289-steph-loves-water", "userReview": "Amazing. Quite possibly the most important book to come out of WW2. This man's first hand account of what went on in Germany during the rise of the National Socialists and the affect upon his family, neighbors and friends is an insight into a society gone mad. Although many Germans were anti-Nazi, the National Socialists came into power because they were seen as the lesser of the two evils, when given a choice between that and Communism. As Professor Klemperer observes throughout this diary, the ideologies are similiar, but most people did not see it that way. The paralyzing fear of day to day living gave rise to an apathy experienced across the country, and he mostly found himself talking to people who could not, or would not, listen.I found this work to be outstanding. Daily recital of the changes and abuses suffered by the Jews over the years 1933-1941 are interspersed with incredible insight and occasional flashes of brilliance. The novella \"Cell 89\" particularily impressed me as an awakening of the human soul. I am so glad that this book survived destruction and am amazed that it was discovered in the 1990s. Everyone should read this book. The lessons and insights in this book could apply to the current situation in the United States. It could also serve as a warning against the dangers of mass apathy."}, {"userName": "Greg Brozeit", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26552534-greg-brozeit", "userReview": "Victor Klemperer was a professor of classical languages in Dresden. He lost his position and sense of security soon after Hitler took power. Although he had converted to Protestantism in 1911, he was classified a Jew by the Nazis. And while Dresden\u2019s Jewish community steadily dwindled because of deportations to Lodz, Auschwitz, and Theresienstadt, since his wife, Eva, was a \u201cfull-blooded Aryan\u201d they were kept safe from deportation until they were notified to prepare to leave the city on February 13, 1945. That night the infamous firebombing of Dresden that killed thousands took place. Ironically, it turned out to be a reprieve for Klemperer and Eva. In the chaos that ensued, he removed the yellow stars from his clothing before they both joined the flood of refugees streaming to the west and south of Germany as the war came to a close. By some miracle, his diaries, which he stored in the shed of a friend on the outskirts of Dresden, survived. They may well be among the best, most insightful documents that describe what life was like at \u201cground level\u201d in Nazi Germany. This first translated volume covers 1933-1941.Klemperer understood the personal threats Nazism posed for him and others like him. He recognized in April 1933 that he was \u201cnow\u2026at the mercy of an arbitrary power.\u201d Within two years the threats became more visceral: \u201cI truly expect that one day our little house will be set alight and I shall be beaten to death.\u201d Less than three months after Hitler came to power, he was \u201calmost used to the condition of being without rights\u201d and noted how official propaganda became \u201cthe opposite of a democratic press is the disciplined press.\u201dCompounding their dread was the abandonment and marginalization of their friends, colleagues, and neighbors. \u201cNo one dares write,\u201d he wrote, later adding, \u201c[b]ut everywhere complete helplessness, cowardice, fear.\u201d Yet there was also a perverse acceptance and support for Hitler he noted in May 1936: \u201cThe majority of the people is content, a small group accepts Hitler as the lesser evil, no one really wants to be rid of him.\u201d Two years later, he was \u201cever more convinced that Hitler truly speaks for more or less all Germans.\u201d As bad as many might have thought the Nazis were, many believed \u201cthe Communists and that would be even worse!\u201d leading him to conclude \u201c[t]he saddest thing about it is that everyone now reckons only with extreme governments: NSDAP or Communism\u2014as if there were nothing in between.\u201d As a veteran of WWI, Klemperer was a German first, but the daily indignities led him to conclude, \u201cNo one can my Germanness away from me, but my nationalism and patriotism are gone forever.\u201dAs early as December 31, 1933, Klemperer anticipated Hannah Arendt\u2019s thesis in \nThe Origins of Totalitarianism\n to \u201cequate National Socialism and Communism: both are materialistic and tyrannical, both disregard and negate the freedom of the spirit and the individual.\u201d Being an academic who lost his position at the university, he understood that \u201c\u2026they do not want anyone to study; intellect, scholarship are the enemies.\u201d By 1941 he was more succinct: \u201cAlways and everywhere: National Socialism does not want to know, to think, only believe\u2026The main thing for tyrannies of any kind is the suppression of the urge to ask questions.\u201dAnother difficulty for Klemperer was that he himself did not consider himself to be a Jew. Indeed, although he would have liked to emigrate\u2014as many of his family members and colleagues did\u2014he was very critical of Zionists, who he felt were \u201care just as offensive as the Nazis\u201d and \u201cexchange[d] nationalism and narrowness for nationalism and narrowness.\u201d His strong opinions caused further isolation; even among the Jewish community, \u201cNo one will help us. To the Jews I am apostate.\u201d Feelings of isolation intensified in his rare communications with friends and family who emigrated. His nephew, who settled in Chicago, \u201chas no idea of the difficulties here. Obtain a visitor\u2019s visa immediately\u2014how easy he thinks it is!\u201d Instead, he and Eva continued to \u201cgo on living fatalistically.\u201dRegardless of his deep convictions, however, Klemperer and Eva were still subject to every legal and social restriction that applied to all Jews. Not only was his profession denied him, but so was, over time, his ability to learn and read. \u201cIn the morning [of October 9, 1936] at the library I was told gently, that as a non-Aryan I was no longer allowed to use the reading room. They will let me take everything home or give it to me in the catalog room, but an official ban has been issued for the reading room.\u201d On December 3, 1938, shortly after Kristallnacht, Klemperer was banned from \u201cusing the library.\u201d The man who informed him \u201cwas distressed beyond words, I had to calm him. He stroked my hand the whole time, he could not hold back the tears,\u201d leading Klemperer to write, \u201cBut these few, sympathizing and in despair, are isolated, and they too are afraid\u201d because \u201cAryan friends of the Jews are always treated worse than Jews themselves.\u201d Other ramifications after Kristallnacht included a prohibition for Jews to go to movie theaters, have driver\u2019s licenses, and increases in taxes, which made it more difficult for them to emigrate, and \u201call Jewish doctors [were] struck from the Medical Register\u2026so they can starve.\u201d After the invasion of Poland, restrictions increased including limits on withdrawals from bank accounts and curfews for Jews after 8 pm. Klemperer\u2019s contemporaneous writing debunks notions that average Germans were unaware of the atrocities committed in their nation\u2019s name. For example, word of the building of the new Buchenwald concentration camp in became common knowledge; \u201cno one comes back from there a second time, between ten and twenty people die every day anyway.\u201d He notes the November 8, 1939 assassination attempt on Hitler at the Munich B\u00fcrgerbr\u00e4u, had him \u201creckoning with arrest, concentration camp, perhaps also the bullet\u201d since \u201cwe know the culprits: England and behind it Jewry.\u201d He also notes in August 1941 that \u201c[t]here is widespread talk now of the killing of the mentally ill in the asylums,\u201d which turned out to be one of the few times Nazi policies were changed due to public outcry.Popular knowledge of the reality of Nazi Germany was also underscored in anecdotes and urban legends implying more than they said, especially since \u201cdissemination carries the threat of prison: A man in Berlin takes his wife to the hospital so she can give birth. A picture of Christ hangs over the bed. The man: \u2018Nurse, that picture must go, I don\u2019t want the Jewboy to be the first thing by child sees.\u2019 The nurse: She herself could not do anything about it, she will report it. In the evening he gets a telegram from the doctor: \u2018You have a son. The picture did not need to be removed, the child is blind.\u2019\u201d Another story he recorded on September 7, 1941: \u201cA married couple\u2026learn that all four of their sons have been killed in Russia. The father hangs himself, the mother hurls the picture of Hitler out of the window into the courtyard Half an hour later she is arrested (\u2018taken away\u2019).\u201dTwo instances of his prescience in his diaries are noteworthy. One of his more philosophical remarks that is as relevant today as when he wrote it right after the 1936 Olympics in Berlin was his recognition of \u201c\u2026an absurd overestimation of sport; the honor of the nation depends on whether a fellow citizen can jump four inches higher than all the rest.\u201d And when he is briefly imprisoned for not having followed rules during a blackout, Klemperer has much time to reflect and realizes, \u201cIt is honorable to be imprisoned now, it will be advantageous to any future character reference.\u201d He foresaw how future generations would elevate the memory of those who resisted.Occasionally Klemperer found fleeting moments of optimism and grace, as he wrote on New Year\u2019s Eve 1938, of \u201cnot [having] reached the last circle of hell, for uncertainty is not the worst thing, because in uncertainty there is still hope.\u201d In his few public forays, Klemperer sometimes had quiet conversations with old friends and acquaintances on street cars only to revert to silence when \u201ca man with a Party badge got on\u2026Such incidents always give me hope for a quarter of an hour. No more.\u201d Prior to Christmas 1939, many of his neighbors committed small acts of kindness. A grocery store owner \u201cslips me one bar of chocolate after another, and the butcher writes on the back of a receipt: For Christmas we have put by a tongue for you.\u201d Some even gave secret gifts of books, \u201can expression of courage and a profession of opposition. It is a most significant symptom of the general mood. In return I gave her Germinal\u2026\u201d These acts of kindness prompted him to write on New Year\u2019s Eve 1939, \u201cI am now convinced that National Socialism will collapse in the coming year. Perhaps we shall perish with it\u2014but it will certainly end, and with it, one way or another, the terror.\u201d He often \u201cencounter[s] much sympathy, people help me out, but fearfully, of course.\u201dWhat little optimism he had was quashed by the swift military success Germany has in Holland, Belgium, and France. \u201cHistorical development takes more time that an individual human being has. And I fear Hitler\u2019s halo of invincibility.\u201d By the end of May 1940 he notes \u201cEverybody in the [Jewish] house absolutely certain of German victory.\u201d Even when wounded soldiers return home for treatment, cries of \u201cIt\u2019s the Jews fault!\u201d only deepen despair. Widespread rumors of England\u2019s capitulation were also taken as fact until the air raids began. In the beginning of 1941, Klemperer realizes that the good news from the front must be false based on what he sees around him; the quality and quantity of meat is severely curtailed, ersatz coffee replaces the real thing, restrictions on Jews multiply\u2014higher taxes, confiscation of typewriters, stricter emigration rules, prohibitions of half-Jews from serving on the front lines, milk delivery for Jews becomes illegal, increased police checks at Jewish homes, bans on smoking for Jews\u2014everything belies official propaganda.Klemperer considered September 19, 1941 to be the worst day of life, when he was required to wear the yellow Star of David, even though he wrote in 1938 that \u201c[f]or half a day I thought, now one must find the courage for suicide.\u201d Perhaps more than anything, it brought back the words he had written in 1933, \u201cI must live here and die here.\u201d As hard as his life had been since 1933, he could not have imagined that things would get even worse as he would describe the events of 1942-1945."}, {"userName": "Steve Cox", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3143978-steve-cox", "userReview": "Most surprising was how quickly after 1933 that the vise began to tighten on Klemperer and his fellow Jews. Second most surprising is how orderly and law-abiding it all was, in a twisted sense. Over the next 12 years, the Jews' rights and privileges were reduced one by one, as Klemperer lost lost his prestigious university job, his house, his food rations, his rights to use Dresden's transportation, etc. Then when almost all Jewish rights were gone and the deportation orders began to be enforced, there was still a pecking order which was by and large upheld by the local authorities. Klemperer watched the majority of his fellow Jews go to the camps, with little illusion as to what awaited them there. He avoided deportation longer than the rest because his wife was an Aryan, and he was a WWI veteran. Still he was next on the list when the Allied bombing of Dresden occurred and he and his wife escaped in the chaos. Klemperer comes across as a fairly priggish cuss; you'll tire of his self-regard and his constant references to the work on his \"dix-huitieme\", an academic study of 18th century French thought. But that makes him a real person, dealing with the tedium and trials of daily life under a regime that he watched turn from menacing to murderous, trying to make sense of it all."}, {"userName": "Jo", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1364981-jo", "userReview": "In April 1935, Klemperer (1881-1960) was a Protestant professor of French literature at Dresden University and a veteran of WWI.

By 1945, he was one of only 198 registered Jews left in Dresden. Through it all, Klemperer kept a diary, that was not intended to be published. It is a detailed account of living under the Nazis, indignity piled on indignity, all that he & his wife cared about stripped away.

Superiority is clearly defined by how humanely you treat the vulnerable and not how easily you decide to crush the defenceless.Victor Klemperer's two-volume diaries are simply the most significant publication in recent years in any historical discipline. While we are amazed by Frank's maturity in her observation and style and above all her resilience, Klemperer is the better writer. This is not solely due to his more mature years but also to the fact that he was a professor of literature at Dresden University. His writing style reflects his academic training as does his perceptive understanding of the times he was living through.What led to the Second World War was the gradual mutation of German society from a modern, democratic society to one prepared to first accept a dictator and then follow him blindly down the road to European domination. What was it then that enabled this to occur at grass roots level? Klemperer gives us fundamental insights into this question while documenting the acerbic hate towards the Jews and the daily atmosphere inside a country taken over by a military mindset. He also paints a surprising picture of a German social kaleidoscope split between those who are openly aggressive alongside those who are secretively compassionate.Victor Klemperer had no alternative but to bear witness and leave as his last will and testament an accurate document of what he and others were subjected to the moment society went to the wall and civilised acceptance of others' differences was exchanged for unremitting intolerance and accusation.The diaries are an integral part of clarifying the extent to which the ordinary German was responsible for Hitler's policies and the resultant Holocaust. The poignant two-volume memoirs are now standard texts in this field of study.Therefore, for anyone with a serious interest in Nazi Germany this is a must-read whether they be an armchair academic or Oxbridge-Ivy League aspiring Don."}, {"userName": "Ian", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47154315-ian", "userReview": "When I first started reading the diaries of Victor Klemperer, I wondered how to keep track of all the various acquaintances and family members he is mentioning.

This diary (Part I of II) begins abruptly on January 14, 1933. This is obviously not when he started his record-keeping.

At that point in his career he already had a few scholarly works in print and was planning another, a project on the 18th century he continued researching and writing until circumstances forced him to postpone that work. But he did continue the personal diary he had begun many years earlier, now with the purpose of documenting not the big picture of Nazism in Germany (he would leave that to historians) but the experience of it by a single individual, along with other ordinary personal matters he had been recording for decades. The fact that the Nazis considered him a Jew despite his conversion to Protestantism in his youth put him in the bulls-eye of their abuse. But he was married to an \"Aryan,\" and on that account some of the harshest measures heaped on non-Aryans were sometimes blunted or postponed, including shipment to Theresienstadt, the concentration camp in Czechoslovakia where most of Dresden's Jews were to meet their deaths. He had to wear the yellow star, avoid contact with Aryans, not use public transportation, subsist on starvation rations, and would in fact have been sent off to his death within a few days had not British Lancaster bombers rained fire on the population of Dresden, Aryan and non-Aryan alike, in the spring of 1945, allowing Victor and his wife Eva to escape the city and leave behind his Jewish identity by claiming his identification papers were destroyed in the fire. There are plenty of books about the Nazi era. What's so special about the Klemperer diaries? Why would I recommend these two volumes to anyone interested in learning what the Hitler regime was like over any work by a professional historian, however worthy that study may be? My answer has to do with the special character of the diaries, their combination of documentation of a horror growing worse with each passing day (everyone Klemperer talks to believes such an absurd regime will surely fall within months) and the details of a middle-aged upper-middle-class couple's life, including the stresses and strains on their marriage, not all of them the result of Nazi oppression. One quickly comes to feel one is living with the Klemperers, if only as a fly on the wall, as they struggle to complete the construction of their \"dream house\" in a suburb just outside Dresden \u2014 Eva's obsession despite their having to subsist on a modest pension after her husband losses his university post. The daily visits to the house site as they scrape together the money to lay a foundation, then construct modest living quarters and, of course, a garden, seem like an exercise in futility, given what the reader knows is going to happen a few years later. You want to shout at them, \"Get out! Get out!\" But Eva is determined to have her house, partly, one suspects, because she had given up her own career as a musicologist and performer in favor of her husband's career. Besides, Hitler really did seem too extreme, too downright surreal, to last much longer (odd, that in America he was seen as a \"moderate\" who would keep the Bolshevik menace in check). And, besides, as the author of these diaries keeps asserting, he, Victor Klemperer, is a German, a real German, not like the aberrations who had taken over his country, though his faith in that identity is sorely tried over the next twelve years.The course of the Klemperer marriage, however inadvertent, is continuous and detailed. In the '30s, Victor is careful to not complain about Eva's morning fits or constant dental emergencies or her obsession with the house, but the reader wonders what is going on in the woman's mind, when (with the hindsight of history) the dreadful future seems so clearly written on the wall. But as the years pass and the noose tightens economically and in every other way around the necks of Jews, Eva meets each new deprivation with remarkable personal resources, not just sharing all of her husband's social and economic disabilities but assisting neighbors in need in the \"Jews houses\" where the Klemperers are finally forced to live, right down to scrubbing their floors. She also risks her freedom (as an Aryan she could have secured her own status simply by divorcing him), if not her life, by smuggling the manuscript pages of his diary to an Aryan safe house. Using her Aryan ration card she spends hours each day scrounging for food (mostly potatoes, sometimes rotten). And, yet, the Klemperers maintain a remarkably active social life, mostly with others marked as Jews but also with a handful of Aryans. In the end, the diaries reveal the slow maturing of two human beings who are already well into middle age at the point the diaries open. Victor evolves from a slightly ivory-towerish academic into a more fully rounded person capable of both empathy and a sense of complexity for the people, all the people, he lives among; Eva, from a house-hungry spouse with possibly a grievance about the loss of her own chance at a career into a courageous and devoted spouse and neighbor. Their marriage and love for one another grows stronger with each new stress placed upon them. What seems in the early pages of the diaries a marriage held together perhaps largely by routine and convenience, by its mid-point has become a thing of unshakable devotion and deep affection. The diaries provide documentation of many different aspects of German society under the Third Reich, despite the restriction of their being written from one man's point of view. Among these is the obvious fact that many Germans had no use for Hitler, were sympathetic to those the Nazis designated as Jews or otherwise non-Aryan and, as might be expected in a situation where getting the wherewithal just to survive became more and more difficult, were largely ignorant of the strictures Jews were living under. Why else would they risk their own freedom and lives by befriending and assisting individual Jews? There is a na\u00efvet\u00e9 about some of their expressions of support \u2014 a stranger crossing the street to shake the hand of someone wearing a yellow star (much to the chagrin of the person wearing it, knowing how dangerous such an act was, primarily for the star-wearer); a shopkeeper slipping extra food into the bag of someone wearing the star and offering a whispered word of encouragement to hang on, it won't be long now till the war is over. There are far too many of these acts, some of them a good deal more substantial than what I've indicated, to put them down to anything other than sincerity. And on the question of what ordinary Germans knew about the \"Final Solution,\" even Jews themselves didn't realize what shipment to Theresienstadt meant until the last year or two of the war. For a time they even entertained a belief that in Theresienstadt they would at least have a better diet and get decent medical care. It's hard to believe non-Jews could have known something more, at least not ordinary working stiffs, despite the manic, irrational broadcasts by Goebbels blaming \"World Jewry\" for all the evils in the world (in one he insists the Jews using their American dupes were bombing Rome in order to destroy Christianity, just a first step in their plan to kill all the gentiles in the world). Even when the truth becomes clear about Auschwitz and the other death camps, some supporters of Hitler insist the Fuehrer could not have known about the camps because he was a \"man of peace.\u201d Klemperer writes:\"...National Socialism was already [in 1923] ...powerful and popular. Except that at the time I did not yet see it like that. How comforting and depressing that is! Depressing: Hitler really was in line with the will of the German people. Comforting: One never really knows what is going on. Then the Republic seemed secure, today the Third Reich appears secure.\"But he also writes, later:\"There is no German or West European Jewish question. Whoever recognizes one, only adopts or confirms the false thesis of the NSDAP and serves its cause. Until 1933 and for at least a good century before that, the German Jews were entirely German and nothing else.... The anti-Semitism, which was always present, is not at all evidence to the contrary. Because the friction between Jews and Aryans was not half as great as that between Protestants and Catholics, or between employers and employees or between East Prussians for example and southern Bavarians or Rhinelanders and Bavarians. The German Jews were part of the German nation, as the French Jews were a part of the French nation, etc. \"There seem, in fact, to be two distinct kinds of (Aryan) Germans in these diaries: Nazi thugs who descend on Jews' apartments, beat up the old women and men and steal the butter off the table before trashing the place; and \"ordinary\" Germans, even officials like local police who, when they had to visit the Jews Houses, doffed their hats, shook hands, apologized for the intrusion and even offered words of reassurance. One wonders how this could be the same country, never mind the same city. These \"good\" Germans give Victor hope, though by the end he believes the entire nation will have to be reeducated in the values he believes to have been essential to German culture dating back to the Enlightenment (he blames Romanticism for Nazism). He, happily, lives to see that day and even to reclaim his former professorship at the Technical University of Dresden, which lay then in the Soviet zone and becomes part of East Germany. One wonders why these diaries are not more widely read as firsthand witness for that horrific period of German history. Is it because life as Klemperer records it is too complex for our sound-bite culture (some of the older men in the Jews House cheer for the Wehrmacht \u2014 they had fought against the Brits and French in the first world war and can't bring themselves to change sides). Is it because he insists early on that Zionism and Nazism are ideologically the same thing: blood = land? I keep expecting him to change his mind about Zionism after the slaughter of Jews goes into high gear in 1942-43, but he sticks to his guns. He fully expects to be one of the slaughtered, watches as his neighbors are taken away in twos and threes. He loses his faith in the Germany he believed in before 1933, but he never loses faith in the principles he believes that culture exemplified at its best.It's impossible to summarize a work as varied and rich as these diaries, never mind give a sense for the experience of living through those years vicariously with the Klemperers. The diaries end in 1945 with a return to their suburban home after living for several weeks as refugees in Bavaria. But that return is, of course, just another beginning. The volume of the diary that takes up where these two leave off extends as far as 1959 and was published in Britain, but not in the US. Klemperer died the following year, 1960, of a heart attack."}, {"userName": "Ana ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana", "userReview": "This book is incredibly hard to finish, even if you're armed with enthusiasm about the subject. These are the diaries of a literature professor of Dresden, a Jew married with an Arian woman during the years of the Nazi regime coming into full power. It is, at times, extremely boring, because across 8 years of writing, some pages are just mundane details about his and his wife's life under the ever-growing hatefulness of the regime. However - that is the exact point of interest of this book. It gives you details on the opinions of people living right at that time, their daily struggles, their hopes and dreams, what they ate, what they fed their cats, how they committed suicide, how they went on walks and so on and so forth. It is tedious at times, but worth it for the overall picture. The one most interesting thing of it all is Klemperer's focus on Lingua Tertii Imperii (Language of the Third Reich), where it shows the beginnings of him realizing how important language and the use of it was to maintaining the Nazi regime in place. After he collected this information, he went on to write a book specifically about that, which I am hoping to read soon."}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6437963-rebecca", "userReview": "Since I had to read this for an essay*, I'm not going to write a full review for this.

Klemperer kept detailed diaries all his life and this volume covers 1933 through 1941 from the appointment of Hitler as Chancellor to the entry of the United States into the war.Klemperer tells us who stops by for coffee or dinner, we learn about his relatives, we follow him as he learns to drive and struggles with his used car, we meet his cat. But we also are privy to political discussions he has with those around him and we learn of each new restriction placed upon him as a Jew. We see how he struggles to keep up his scholastic writing even after losing his job as a humanities professor, we worry with him as he tries to build a new house just as the Nazis begin applying more and more actions to punish Jews. One of the most important aspects of the book to me was seeing just how slowly the NSDAP tightened the screws on German Jews; a little bit at a time, slowly adding restrictions, taking things away - death by a thousand cuts. He loses his job but keeps his pension, he deals with continually changing rules about building the house, he loses access to the library reading room then later to the lending library, he now can't hold a driver's license, then must surrender his typewriter. It's one turn of the screw after another for years. This was fascinating to me because everything I've read before led me to believe that all of these things happened in a very short time with only a couple of acts. Here you watch people who believe everything is temporary, it will a be turned around, and each act is probably as bad as it will get - although that attitude eventually changes.But as bad as things are, Klemperper also gives us glimpses of real humanity among the Aryan German population. There are store owners who slip him additional foodstuffs or send him holiday treats or just find little ways to give him hope. I was particularly struck late in the book, in 1941 when Jews are now forced to wear the yellow Star of David on their clothing and Aryans are directed to have nothing to do with the Jews, Klemperer relates an experience of a Frau Reichenbach who is shopping, wearing her star. She is greeted by a man at the doorway to a store. When she says he must have mistaken her for someone else, he replies, \"No, I do not know you, but you now will be greeted frequently. We are a group who greet the Jews' star.\" Klemperer continually shows us that there is a human side to Germans; that not all Germans turned a blind eye to the evils around them.The most amazing bit of writing in the book to me was a section written after Klemperer had spent 8 days in jail for a blackout violation. He was denied his glasses, paper or pencil for most of the time (a guard slipped him a pencil and one sheet of paper eventually) but working after the fact he wrote a long retelling of his time in the cell. It really does give you the sense of his agony and the maddening experience of surviving these days in complete isolation. Incredible writing - you are in Klemperer's mind.I picked up this book upon a recommendation from a fellow visitor to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum and I am ever so grateful for his recommendation. I would suggest that if you are not up on the history of the Third Reich, it would be good to do as I did and read a historical overview before starting this book. I had recently finished The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich and that helped me understand many of the events that Klemperer references. There are some helpful endnotes in the book as well. On a side note, Victor Klemperer was the cousin of composer Otto Klemperer who emigrated to the United States. Otto's son Werner went on to play to role of Colonel Klink in the television comedy Hogan's Heroes. Klemperer agreed to take the role only after being assured that Klink would always be portrayed as a complete dolt."}, {"userName": "Andrew Davis", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18838479-andrew-davis", "userReview": "An excellent story. A life of French Literature professor in Dresden between 1933 and 1941. First he was barred from exams. Then he was dismissed following the release of the Racial Purity Act. He continues to work at home putting all his energy into the history of French literature in XVIII century. With ever increasing pressure from government many of his friends emigrate. He's reluctant especially because his aryan wife starts building the house for them. He also feels strongly German and can't see himself anywhere else. With war approaching emigration is becoming more and more difficult. Finally, it is stopped. He is fined by the local council for weeds in his garden. He's forced to change a flat roof on his garage to a gabled one to fit with the local environment. Finally, he's forced to moved out and live with other Jewish families in a separate villa. His own house is being rented by the local trader who wishes to open shop there. Klemperer is forced to pay for this. With war around food is restricted and regulated. Most of the shops don't want to serve Jewish customers. Jews have to wear armbands and star of David on their chests. His place of living is audited and all belongings recorded. When a small shaft of light gets out of his window during the blackout he is denounced and sentenced to a week in prison. Jews in other towns get transported to Warsaw or Lodz ghettos in Poland. As a Jew he is forced to contribute to Winter Aid. His account, previously restricted, get blocked when a war with the US starts and any help from his brother there ceases.What is so good with this story is that shows how step by steps human rights are taken away from the Jewish population. Klemperer miraculously survives all this and the fact that he used to fight for Germany and WWI and that his wife is Aryan helps to make it happen.This is only the first of the three volumes.
