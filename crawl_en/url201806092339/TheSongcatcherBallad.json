I was highly-motivated to read it -- I had loved McCrumb's \"The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter,\" which was an engrossing, haunting, lyrical tale about a family tragedy and the goings-on of a community of people in the hills of Appalachia. \"The Songcatcher\" has the same setting and it tries to have that same haunting, lyrical style. However, I felt that it lacked focus with too many story threads. Some of these story threads, taken separately, would make nice short stories or novellas, but they just didn't work well as a novel. For instance, I was captivated by the story of Malcolm McCourry, the young 18th-century Scottish boy who was kidnapped from his homeland and ended up in America years later. His story was well-written, engrossing, and tugged at your heart. I was sorry when the narrative shifted to his descendants, who were not nearly as interesting. More importantly, McCrumb's attempt to use a song to tie together all these people's stories through time didn't work very well. Towards the end, when new characters are introduced and the story bounces back and forth between two plane wrecks and a silly, desperate search for the song, things unravel and the story loses energy and focus. In addition, the book is poorly titled. While there was mention of a songcatcher or two in the narrative, the book was not at all about a songcatcher (songcatchers were people, usually musicians or ethnomusicologists, who traveled around remote areas to record and capture folk songs that are being handed down orally from generation to generation). In an Afterword, you learn that several of the central characters of the book were real, and that in fact, they were McCrumb's ancestors, and that was neat. There is a lot of heart in these stories. But as a novel, it just doesn't hold together very well."}, {"userName": "Bobbi", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3149193-bobbi", "userReview": "One of the best things about the Appalachian region is it's rich history of music. You can hear the scotch/irish melodies woven through many of the songs which were not even written down until a couple of decades ago. Sharyn McCrumb's story captures the beauty of the mountains, its colorful inhabitants and folklore. I live in these mountains and you can find music in almost any place you look any night of the week.

If not for the meeting, I would have ditched it after the first chapter. The set up for the book is laudable: Singer Lark McCourry wants to locate a song she had heard sung when she was a little girl. When she is called back home to see her dying father one last time, she decides to look for the song while she is there. In a hurry, she hires a small plane to fly her from a big airport to the small one near her hometown. The plane crashes and the pilot dies. Lark survives, and while people are looking for her, we are presented with other characters and their histories.  The only thing they have in common is the song. They all have a connection to it. Again, the idea is great, but the writing was dull. Many times I thought I was reading a report. McCrumb writes several pages of just telling the reader about someone. For example, when she writes about Lark's ancestor, Malcolm McCourry, she summarizes his actions: \"We headed out a few weeks after the wedding, bound for the high country...\" It would be nice if the author had added details about how they traveled. Did they ride horses, walk, go in a wagon pulled by oxen, horses, or mules? What possessions did they take with them? Though this is just one example of what frustrated me about her writing, she wrote like this throughout the novel. She did occasionally toss in a bone of showing the reader what was going on by inserting a dialogue between characters, but even then, a character's words sounded like he/she were reading from an encyclopedia. How does McCrumb get so much praise for writing like this? The characters are boring. I felt no emotional connection to any of them. They seemed very one dimensional: mean or cold or selfish or troubled. Every creative writing class I ever took stressed that a writer show rather than tell the reader what's going on so that the reader can participate in the story. In other words, create an emotional space for the reader to live within so that the story is emotionally alive to them. I don't see McCrumb doing much of this. For the historical chapters, she told and told and told. I didn't see much story going on there either. Anyone could have researched this information and made a report too. She filled these chapters with very few historical details. It seems a lazy way to write historical fiction. I have read many historical fiction novels and the authors are careful to include details that really make the period come alive. Finally, I think this novel gives hope to struggling writers. It tells them that if they want to be published, they can just write a mediocre story and it can get published. People will love it."}, {"userName": "Betted", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5136716-betted", "userReview": "Tracing an ancestor back to his roots gave the author some fascinating factual fodder that brightens this book about a search for an old ballad. The author\u2019s own family stories prove that truth is often stranger than fiction. One of the key characters is Malcolm, a member of the author\u2019s family tree, who was kidnapped from a beach in the Scottish Isles to work on shipboard when he was less than ten years old. On the ship he worked hard but also learned songs, including the fictional one that is the subject of the book. Once grown, he left the sea to study law on the dry land of New Jersey, participated in the Revolutionary War, and became a respected pillar of the community. At the ripe old age of 50, however, he abandoned his family and career, resettled in the less populated Appalachian Mountains and started a new family, while passing on his songs. The book ties together many different eras by weaving together the stories of other family members, some fictional, some real, who passed the song from generation to generation until the present day. Along the way readers learn a bit about the way that many traditional ballads were created and gathered by historians, for profit as well as posterity. Some of the characters converse with ghosts or act on intuitions so strong they could be labeled precognition, but this isn\u2019t a story of the supernatual. It is the story of the continuity of family as well as the ghosts of family ties that haunts each of us and quite a good read.Highly respected Appalachian author Sharyn McCrumb's next Ballad novel, King's Mountain, will be published on September 17 2013 by St. Martins Press."}, {"userName": "Melanti", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3034846-melanti", "userReview": "This was the first book in the Ballad series that I ever read - actually the first Sharyn McCrumb book in general that I've read and I just finished re-reading it for my bid to read the entire series in order from start to the end.This book made me fall in love with Sharyn McCrumb. While it doesn't match the beauty of She Walks These Hills or The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter, (I'm beginning to think that none can) it's still a wonderful work. I love how McCrumb takes one historical story and several contemporary plot threads and shows the same themes throughout otherwise unrelated threads. In this case, it's the concept of \"home\", or perhaps \"you can't go home again\". While you can read each of these as a stand alone, reading this as part of a series helps you appreciate some of the plot threads better - especially that of the two deputies and Nora. IT was even better on the re-read with already knowing the background for some of these characters than when I read it the first time.McCrumb does get a bit more preachy in this book than is her usual; there's a debate on the proper pronunciation of \"Appalachian\" and the types of people who don't conform to the local pronunciation, and several ideas like ballad collecting (and then copyrighting) being akin to strip mining. It's noticeable, but thankfully not very intrusive and rather thought provoking."}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/263794-hannah", "userReview": "Someone recommended this, but it probably isn't really my preferred \"style\" of book.

She must find her way back while searching for the \"lost\" folk-song that is her family's legacy. It doesn't sound all that interesting, and it really isn't.

I do love books where there are two different stories linked together, and few do it better than this author. In The Songcatcher, the two stories are of Folksinger Lark McCourry who is trying to track down a song that she has a vague memory of, and of her ancestor Malcolm MacQuarry, who has learned the song while being shanghaied aboard a ship as a child.As always, there is a skillful blending of the two stories. Nora Bonesteel, the 70+ year old ex Sunday school teacher who stays out of people's business but who is always drawn in against her will is consulted. Nora is not only a keeper of local history and knowledge, but she has the ability to see ghosts and to know what has happened to people before her time. One of my favorite things about McCrumb's series is the fact that each book has a traditional ballad associated with it (hence the \u201cBallad series\u201d name). I love the old songs, and how McCrumb relates them to the story. So in this book, I really enjoyed the multiple old songs, and the fact that the sought after folk song is so integral to the story. As always, both story lines are satisfactorily wrapped up at the end.

It was a goodwill find of my mom\u2019s. I was drawn to it because the author is from N.C. She even went to Chapel Hill which I happen to live in the same county, only 15 minutes away. McCrumb writes a series of books that follows a folk song handed down from the mountain folk of the Appalachia. Oddly enough my grandfather\u2019s family are from Mt Rogers. She goes through a century and a half of family genealogy, tracing the steps of the song. Filling in gaps of the history with fiction.

My husband's family is the Johnson City/ Jonesborough,. TN area so although I haven't actually lived there, I have seen much of the area and become very familiar with people who have been lived there all of their lives. She excels at describing the traditions and lifestyles of the natives of that area---especially the fierce independence, not wanting to be beholden to anyone, and clannish! In this novel, the story starts in Scotland with a boy being kidnapped and eventually ending up in America. My mother-in-law's family is Scottish so that was another point of interest for me. Many of them still live in the mountains of East Tennessee. In this novel, McCrumb focuses on the importance of folk songs/balads being passed on from generation to generation even when the country of residence changes as she tells the story of Malcolm McCourry and his descendants. Although he lived in New Jersey for many years after coming to the United States, he always felt something was missing and decided to join his favorite daughter and her husband when they decide to move to western North Carolina and build a new life there. He leaves a thriving law practice, a prominent place in society, and wife and never regrets it. In the mountains of North Carolina, he finds what he has been looking for---a place where his soul feels at peace. The story picks up later with one of his descendants, John Walker, another lawyer who has led a reclusive life for many years. McCrumb ties the themes together through John's daughter, Lark McCourry who has become a famous folksinger. This novel is not a thriller although there is some suspense at one point but I found McCrumbs' writing style kept me interested until the very end because of her skill as a storyteller."}, {"userName": "Leighly", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3117156-leighly", "userReview": "One of the things I love best about Sharyn McCrumb is her style of storytelling. She once again delivered with Songcatcher.One of the things I will carry away from this book is how the pronounciation of words can have political meaning. Two examples are given in this book. The first is the when a New Yorker pronounces Appa-lay-cha when the mountain people prefer Appa-latch-a. The New Yorker insists on saying it his way until the second example is given. Apparently there is a city is Scotland that has two names. The first is what the people of Scotland call it and the second is what the people of England call it. As the storyteller points out asking for directions using either name will get you to the same place. However, the name you ask for shows your political affiliation. The same holds true for Appa-lay-cha or Appa-latch-a. It goes beyond the basic political meaning as well to the core of how words contain power. It was a very interesting concept that I will remember.Another premise in this book is the history of song catching. I learned about how song catchers went through the mountains writing down the folklore and traditional songs of the region. The song catchers then proceeded to copyright the traditional music requiring the mountain people to pay a royalty to sing what had always been theirs. It's one of those crimes most people outside of the mountains has never heard of, I certainly hadn't. Taking advantage of good people with good hearts who simply wanted to preserve their heritage assuming they will be too stupid to ever catch on. It's another one of those things in which I sincerely hope karma works."}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6976601-emma", "userReview": "I picked up this book in a second hand book section of a roadside cafe, looking for some light reading for the bus.

I'm cynical, I know, but I just didn't think the plot was thick enough to be a mystery. It was interesting as historical fiction, and I really enjoyed the way the two stories intertwined, past and present sewn together to create one history.I also liked that the romances hinted at and/or hoped for throughout the novel were not all neatly resolved. I've never read any of the others in this series, and to be honest, I won't be seeking them out, but this was good as a stand-alone book. The important parts of the story were wound up, but the secondary characters were left open, making for a more satisfying read than if everything had come to a neat conclusion.I liked, too, the mystic elements - the fairies, the spirits of the forests, and the old midwife who made the prophecy at Malcolm's birth.

While both the historical narrative and the present-day story about a country and western singer coming back to visit her dying father are interesting, I found the switch back and forth a little awkward. I'd get caught up in the storyline of the singer and feel annoyed to be interrupted with a long rambling description of the Scotsman's journey by ship across the ocean. He gradually gets more interesting as a character, but there still tended to be too much verbiage for my taste. If I'd been the editor of this book, I would have tightened up those sections a bit and perhaps changed where they interrupted the \"mystery\" (more of a suspense/ghost story) in the present-day plot.

I did not think as far as being an overall great story that it really fit the bill for me, as it didn't seem thecharacters themselves really experienced any kind of growth or triumph as individuals, with the possible exception of Joe LeDonne. They seemed to be there more to embellish the story of the central song whose history is followed in the book.
