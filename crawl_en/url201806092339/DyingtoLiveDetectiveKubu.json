While I am sure reading the earlier books first would have provided me with more history about Detective Kudu and his family, I did not feel like I was dropped into the midst of a storyline that I knew nothing about. The plot was easy to follow, the premise was unique and timely, and I adored the carefully crafted and highly likeable main characters.I am a huge mystery lover and am always thrilled to find a new series especially one that has numerous titles already. Even more enjoyable was the fact that the series is set in Botswana. Embarrassingly enough before I began Dying to Live, I did not know exactly where Botswana was located within Africa nor that Gaborone was the capital. The authors, Michael Sears and Stanley Trollip writing as Michael Stanley, incorporate the setting and culture of the Batswana (a term I learned from this book) so vividly that I frequently felt like I was there in Botswana with Detective Kubu and his family and other cohorts. Their integration of the language, food, and other cultural issues and items unique to the Bushmen and Batswana made the story both fascinating and very enjoyable. They even include a glossary at the end of the book explaining various terms and expressions that were used in the book which I found very helpful. I was thoroughly delighted to learn so much about the region and truly cannot wait to go back and read the first five volumes. The only reason I am giving the book a 4.5 versus a 5 was that the resolution of the plot slowed down a bit towards the end, and I wish that the ending had come a bit sooner. Other than that small complaint, the book was perfect. I have been very pleased in the last year or so to be introduced to genuinely well-written mysteries that are not too dark (I am not a fan of super dark stories) and take place in locales with which I am not as familiar. These series include this series by Michael Stanley, Vaseem Khan\u2019s Baby Ganesh Agency stories set in India, Jane Harper\u2019s The Dry set in the Australian Outback, and Tracee de Hahn\u2019s fledgling series set in Lausanne, Switzerland (I am anxiously awaiting the next book in both Harper\u2019s and de Hahn\u2019s series). As the world continues to grow smaller and more accessible, gaining knowledge and understanding of other cultures is a must, and what better way to learn than to read a great mystery?!I highly recommend Dying to Live to anyone who loves a good, well-thought out mystery with a unique and beautiful setting. Thanks to Minotaur Books and NetGalley for the chance to read this ARC in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Eva", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7281449-eva", "userReview": "After getting acquainted with Scandi-Noir a few months ago, I now find myself being introduced to Sunshine Noir and who even knew that was a thing?!Dying to Live is the sixth book in the Detective Kubu series but can be perfectly read as a stand-alone. Not having read the previous books in the series myself, I never felt lost or confused. Its beautiful and atmopsheric setting in the African country of Botswana really makes it stand out from other police procedurals in the crime fiction genre and allows it to deal with issues that may not work as well in a big western city environment.When the body of a Bushman is found, investigators are baffled. To all appearances, the victim seems to be quite old, yet his organs could easily belong to a much younger person. There\u2019s also a bullet lodged in his body but no entry wound, nor scars. Then the body is stolen from the morgue, a witch doctor goes missing and the team can\u2019t find an American anthropologist either. Are all these events connected or pure coincidence? Detective Kubu and his team definitely have their work cut out for them.It took me a while to get used to the various characters and their names, although there is a rather handy-dandy list for you to check at the start of the book if you get confused. But once I got the hang of it, I found myself immersed in the case that was being investigated. Dying to Live has a complicated and well executed plot with multiple layers and a bunch of untrustworthy and double crossing characters. How can you not be hooked, I ask you?I found the subject matter to be incredibly thought-provoking as we dive into the world of man\u2019s insatiable urge and obsession to find ways to live longer, no matter the money or the means. Ultimately this is a story about greed and corruption, about healers and smuggling and its setting in Botswana works like a charm. This would quite frankly make an excellent tv series!"}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27246754-sarah", "userReview": "Dying To Live is the sixth book in the detective Kubu series. As I only started reading the series from book three, they do tend to work well as stand alone\u2019s but definitely recommend reading them all as they really are good books.Whilst there are horrible crimes featured in the books, as obviously it\u2019s a crime series, I usually find that thanks to the lovable Kubu, he usually brings a bit of humor to the books. This time round I didn\u2019t find that there. Don\u2019t get me wrong as it wasn\u2019t a bad thing but I did miss this as it\u2019s something that I love about the series. The reason for this is there is a story line to do with HIV so Kubu is a lot more sombre.Samantha is a fantastic character. Her and Kubu make a great team. They are a bit like chalk and cheese as they are definitely opposites but this is what makes them more endearing to the readers.Reading of the crimes in Dying To Live is like a whole different world. With witch doctors and Rhino horn smugglers, they certainly are not crimes you would come across in your stereo typical British crime books which gives the Detective Kubu books a certain appeal.Dying To Live is yet another enjoyable offering from the very talented writing duo. The series would be great for the television though through the authors writing skills, the reader very much gets transported into Kubu\u2019s world which at times is quite a scary one!My thanks to Orenda Books for a copy of this book. All opinions are my own and not biased in anyway."}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9809518-christine", "userReview": "Dying to Live sees the return of the most lovely down to earth detective on this earth. I don\u2019t think anyone can find anything not to love about Detective Kubu. He is goodness personified. A top bloke. A family man. He is up against evil and superstition in his native country. This Botswanan series is packed full of dark unsettling themes and top notch crime.Dying to Live was written by Michael Stanley and is book six in the series. For those of you unfamiliar with this series, Michael Stanley is a successful writing partnership between Michael Sears and Stanley Trollip. I have been following the adventures of Detective \u2018Kubu\u2019 Bengu since a Death in the Family. This is sunshine noir, with a dash of something incredibly special.The latest cases for Detective Kubu bring superstition and greed to the forefront. Kubu and his talented sidekick, Samantha find themselves looking into some rather bizarre occurences. An aged bushman, with some unique skills in medicine, is found dead in suspicious circumstances. What is odd is that the organs from his body do not match the age of the rest of him. The organs are younger. Has he found some secret elixir of youth? Added to this we have a witch doctor who has vanished into thin air. When the bushman\u2019s remains are stolen from the local mortuary, Kubu finds the case taking a dark and disturbing turn. On a personal level, Kubu and his family have to deal with the decline in health of his adopted daughter, Nono. She is HIV positive.This is rather a dark and haunting story, which feels incredibly relevant. Its raises all kinds of thoughts about witch doctors, their dubious potions and the worldwide market for them. Like Kubu, I find the whole concept of witch doctors odd and shocking. Although it makes sense that in some cultures, there would be traditional potions and ointments to deal with every day disease. However in this instance, we see that rare beautiful animals are killed and their body parts used as ingredients, as well as human parts on occasion. Disgusting!My verdict is that the latest Detective Kubu story is unbeatable, raw and very moreish. I find myself craving more. Quality crime, with a conscience. Sunshine noir, to unnerve. You cannot go wrong with Dying to Live.

Meanwhile, Bengu's new female deputy Samantha Khama is trying to locate a missing witch doctor, Ramala. When the corpse is stolen and shipped to China, things get interesting and the trail leads to an exporter named Gampone, who is not what he appears. The two cases seem related, but are they?One of the great things about this series is Bengu's love of food, family and Botswana. I felt this book fell down on two of them, but the story of his adoptive daughter's battle with HIV and the strain on his family is touching, even to the point of their considering muti as a solution."}, {"userName": "Joanna Park", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26160119-joanna-park", "userReview": "Review to come!"}, {"userName": "Joanne Robertson", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25524955-joanne-robertson", "userReview": "The first thing I did when I finished this book was to pass it to The Grumpy Scotsman saying \u201cYou HAVE to read this book!\u201d The first thing he said to me when HE had finished was \u201d Why on earth is this not a TV series?! \u201d And for once I have to wholeheartedly agree with him, why hasn\u2019t this series been snapped up for the traditional Sunday night crime drama spot!? It would be brilliant! Anyone who\u2019s a fan of such series as Death in Paradise or The No 1 Ladies Detective Agency would love to see Kobu on the small screen. These dark and twisty crime mysteries really do need to be brought to a bigger audience!There is an unfathomable mystery to solve here when the body of a bushman is discovered. During the autopsy, it\u2019s discovered that his internal organs are those of a much younger man, plus there is an unexplained bullet lodged internally but with no scars to show an entry wound. Kubu and his colleague Samantha become further involved when the body is stolen from the morgue and a witch doctor also goes missing. Can the two cases be related and if so how?I loved the surprising paths that this storyline went down, it was a twisty tale with a few deadends just when you were expecting a thread to lead to further revelations! I do love a red herring or two! The pairing of Kubu and Samantha works well and was a joy to watch as were the family dynamics between Kubu and his wife and family, although I found the plot concerning the health of his daughter desperately sad and difficult to read at times. But this tied in well with the intriguing world of the witch doctors which was one I have never really read about before except in this series and as usual, I found it absolutely fascinating.So although there is a real darkness surrounding the setting and plot, it\u2019s authentic feel and captivating characters kept me enthralled in an amazing environment that I have never been in but feel I know thanks to the \u00a0beautifully descriptive writing by this very clever writing duo.\u00a0What I love about Orenda books is that they consistently bring their readers new and exciting books that have a real edge over other crime thrillers in this genre. This series is no exception and Detective Kubu is one determined and intelligent policeman and it\u2019s impossible not to fall in love with him and his homeland.A recommended read!"}, {"userName": "Nerdish Mum", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33998334-nerdish-mum", "userReview": "Well they did it again, I absolutely loved this book. Detective Kubu is easily one of my all time favourite detectives. He isn't your usual grumpy, hard drinking detective. He's happy (well as happy as a murder detective can be) and has a loving and wonderful family and he genuinely tries to be good to everyone. This on top of being a really great detective. If they could get the casting right, this series should 100% be a tv series. The stories are always quite dark and in Dying To Live, that is still true. The stories always contain things that I've never read about and things that I wouldn't have even thought about and I love that about them. They are also incredibly well written and thought out. There are twists and turns which don't always lead to where you are expecting and will keep you guessing. As usual Botswana is a character in itself and you can feel its essence throughout the book.It was really good to see more of Detective Samantha Khama and get to know her better after enjoying her character previously. All the characters though are very strong and there isn't any I can pick out as being weak. Ian Macgregor the pathologist is also another one of my favourite characters, even though he isn't in it quite as much. Though Dying To Live is the sixth book in the series, reading this as a stand alone is very easily possible. I would definitely recommend reading the whole series though just because of how good it is. Overall another excellent book from Michael Stanley and I'm already excited waiting for their next book."}, {"userName": "Kate~Bibliophile Book Club", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9841866-kate-bibliophile-book-club", "userReview": "Having read and loved the previous books in the series, Deadly Harvest and A Death In The Family , I was thrilled to hear that Dying To Live was on its way!In Dying to Live, Detective Kubu gets involved in the investigation into the death of a Bushman whose body was found near the Central Kalahari Game Reserve. During the course of his investigation, Kubu begins to learn that all is most definitely not what it seems.Parallel to this, a prominent witch doctor is reported missing. This in turn leads to Kubu wondering if both incidents are related. There seems to be more questions than answers to be found. Kubu and his team find themselves in the midst of something much darker than they could have anticipated.Kubu is by far one of my favourite characters to read about. I smile when I start these books because he is just such an affable and genuine character. I love how he\u2019s also very family-oriented. This is really cemented in Dying to Live when he and his wife, Joy, have to deal with some issues at home.I don\u2019t want to say anymore because this book is full of mystery and I\u2019d be afraid to give anything away.

It really was easy slotting everyone into their positions in the story without it feeling like a who is who walk through.The opening scene of a body of an old bushman being found dead on the edge of the Central Kalahari game Reserve, didn\u2019t seem very remarkable until what was found inside him was discovered. In fact it was quite impossible or at least it had been up until now. The internal organs of this seventy year old looking man were more of a man of forty and an old bullet that was found lodged in the body had\u00a0 no scarring of an entry wound.Detective Kubu Bengu and his young partner Samantha Khama make a perfect combination for a cracking investing team that I liked straight away. Kubu was torn between work and hospital where his daughter Nono was very ill. I got the feeling that normally Kubu is a detective that is very clear minded but this case would give him some very tough choices, fuzz up his head and act out of character.I have gained a love of reading about Africa this year so I thought that I would love this book too. I wasn\u2019t wrong although it took me to a much darker side of the Africa than I had read about so far. The one with witch doctors, spells and potions, where I have only skimmed the top but have a great respect and fear of in equal measures. This story made me want to know more as it made my head spin with possibilities.Someone definitely wants these secrets to disappear and it becomes a bit of a hide and seek for the dead with more clues and false trails been dug up. It makes for super page turning perfection.This is very much of story of old meets new with a timeless thread that is always constant, one of greed and corruption where money can be made but this story really throws a spanner in the works because it could hold a secret that all the money in the world couldn\u2019t buy.I wish to thank Anne Cater and Orenda Books for this ARC which I have chosen to review."}, {"userName": "Abbie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50638987-abbie", "userReview": "Typically, I am once again coming into a series late! Dying to Live is the sixth book in the Detective Kubu series, however it worked brilliantly as a standalone and I had absolutely no difficulties in picking up the story and getting involved with the characters.When a Bushman is found dead outside the Kalahari Game Reserve his death appears to be an accident. The autopsy on his body, however, reveals some unusual findings \u2013 while he is outwardly old his internal organs are those of a much younger man. When his body is stolen from the morgue and a Witch Doctor is reported missing it quickly becomes apparent that there is more to this than meets the eye. Detective Kubu and his colleague Detective Kahma find themselves embroiled in a case of murder, smuggling and, ultimately, greed.I adored the characters in Dying to Live. Detective Kubu is instantly loveable \u2013 a big bear of a man who clearly thinks the world of his family, loves his food and uses nana naps to help him think through his cases. Stanley brings him completely to life through the pages of the book and you are left with a real sense of affection for him. He is definitely a character I want to meet again in the rest of the books.The setting in Dying to Live uplifted me \u2013 which is probably a bit strange for a crime novel that involves murder and corruption \u2013 with the sunshine and the African setting bringing light into what is otherwise a book touching on dark issues. The setting also ensures that when reading this book from a UK perspective it is highly unlikely that you will have read anything else quite like it. The cultural aspects of the book are one of the things I enjoyed the most. The Witch Doctors, Muti and storyline involving Kubu\u2019s adopted daughter give Dying to Live a uniqueness, making it a thrilling crime novel that completely transports you to a different world while making you think of subjects you probably haven\u2019t considered before. The juxtaposition between the modern and traditional aspects of life in Botswana are wonderfully portrayed in Dying to Live.As the plot unfolds the reader is left wondering how the threads all fit together. Dying to Live reminded of the classic crime novels in both its pace and construction. It took me down routes I wasn\u2019t expecting to go while throwing red herrings onto my path along the way.

They give a vivid picture of Botswana, a darker place than it is in the Mma Ramotswe books, with HIV-positive children, witch doctors using human body-parts in their potions, drugs, poaching of endangered species, official corruption, and international intrigue. But they also have the same kind, gentle feel in relationships between the main characters. They are written in no particular style, with all the characters sounding pretty much the same, but also providing an extremely complex mystery. And the local color is very engaging. You're not likely to read a paragraph like this in any other series I know of: \"(Detective) Samantha (Khama) could have walked to Game City from her office at Millennium Park, where the CID was housed. However, she decided to drive, in case there was something to bring back. And, truth be told, she was always a little nervous of the troop of baboons that occasionally came down the hill, hoping to find open windows and available food. Several people in the complex had been terrorized by the impudent animals, particularly when fruit was left lying around.\" Much later, after the reader has long forgotten the baboons, the chief inspector is looking idly out his window at the CID: \"The baboons from Kgale Hill were in the parking lot again. 'They'd better not crap on my car,' he muttered, 'or I'll shoot the lot of them.'\""}, {"userName": "Yvonne", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30404765-yvonne", "userReview": "Detective David \u201cKubu\u201d Bengu is called to investigate the death of a bushman. Initial thoughts of natural death are soon changed to murder, with further investigation of the body. The bushman is somethnig of a mystery, his internal organs do not match his exterior. As the investigation progresses, Kubu realises there is far more to this case than meets the eye, especially when the body is stolen. Kubu has a good team to help with this ever confusing and ever-changing case. Samantha Kharma is the first female detective in the branch of Botswanna CID and along with Constable Ixau, a bushman, they will have to use all of their previous knowledge and experience to discover the truth surrounding the death. Do not for one moment think that this story is just about a murder. It is a lot bigger and more involved than you could ever imagine. I have never read any books by this writing duo before, so had no prior expectations, but was very intrigued by the synopsis. It works very well as a stand alone read, leaving me wanting to read more. This is a great detective story discussing various other topics, these have been cleverly woven into the main story. The story is set out in quick chapters to a very satisfying end. The characters were very memorable and well-developed, they show good traits.There are several things I really enjoyed and found useful in this book. One of those was that after I finished this book, was the amount I had learnt, for example \u201cKubu\u201d is the Setswana word for hippopotamus, Setswana is the language of the people of Botswana. Also various cultural aspects and traditions were discussed, making a very insightful read. Some very useful inclusions in this book are an informative glossary at the end of the book, basic, but invaluable.

So far I have managed to devour two previous \u2018Kubu\u2019 novels; click here for my review of Deadly Harvest and here for my review of A Death in the Family. Dying to Live was my third journey to glorious Botswana and my third experience of \u2018sunshine noir\u2019. Dying to Live was published by Orenda Books on 12th July 2017.For those new to this series, the author, Michael Stanley is a writing team of two. But you would never know. Every time I pick up a Michael Stanley novel I\u2019m expecting to see the divide between the two voices, to be able to \u2018spot the difference\u2019. But I can\u2019t. The writing is seamless and wonderfully confident.I am incredibly fond of Detective David Bengu who most of the characters refer to as \u2018Kubu\u2019, the Setswana word for hippopotamus. He\u2019s not my usual broken, addiction riddled detective \u2013 the type I\u2019m usually drawn to. He\u2019s a family man who lives by his principles. I found the sub-plot of his adoptive daughter\u2019s HIV suddenly deteriorating quite hard to read without becoming emotional, but welcomed this revealing insight into Kubu\u2019s home life and his relationship with his wife, Joy.Something I tend to find with Michael Stanley books is that you always get something different. For example, the investigation in Dying to Live initially focused on the death of a Bushman. Which leads us to the Kalahari and into the secretive world of witch doctors. But the most important thing to note is that this is a GREAT mystery. I was completely drawn in to the story and loved the different threads of the investigation and the connections made by Kubu and Detective Samantha Khama. I couldn\u2019t work out whodunit so was rather surprised by the reveal (always a bonus when you don\u2019t see the twist coming!).Would I recommend this book? I would. This is a great series which I will always come back to. I feel a real warmth towards Kubu and his family, there\u2019s something very reassuring about reading these books. Saying that, please don\u2019t be fooled into thinking they are fluffy reads because they are most definitely not. I recommend that you also read Deadly Harvest and A Death in the Family. Not because you need to as I think Dying to Live works perfectly well as a standalone, but because they are great books. More Kubu please, Michael Stanley \u2013 the sooner, the better :).Four stars out of five.I chose to read and review an ARC of Dying to Live.

I had not previously read any of Michael Stanley's novels and whilst Dying to Live is the sixth book in the Detective Kubu series, I did not feel as though I was at a disadvantage having not read the others. The book works as a standalone and is certainly inspiration to read the previous instalments. On first impressions I was sure that I would not enjoy this book due to feeling that the plot may be too complex or that it would not compare to the typical thrillers I was used to. However, I was pleasantly surprised. When a Bushman is found dead, Detective Kubu and his partner, Detective Kahma, must solve the mystery surrounding his death. The death of the Bushman seems accidental but soon the detectives learn that there is far more going on than meets the eye. The story is fairly slow in comparison to other thrillers but this allows for the author to give a true sense of the setting and to get to know Detective Kubu. Even though the story is slow-moving, that does not mean that is not full of suspense and twists. The conclusion was excellent and left me wanting more. There is a natural build-up to the stunning conclusion throughout and Stanley's seamlessly ties in the story throughout. Whilst the book is definitely worth reading for the mystery alone, it also allowed me to learn more about the culture of some countries and also some of the practices which can occur within these cultures. I felt that the author had excellent knowledge of other cultures and the practices of the Witch Doctors. The book is set in the towns and villages of Botswana and the author describes the settings effortlessly. I felt as though I had been transported to Africa. The author managed to bring not only the setting to life but also the characters and their traits and personalities. Michael Stanley has created a new type of detective, one which is experienced and passionate about his work whilst remaining logical and true to himself. It is a refreshing take on the role of the detective, especially when there are so many 'mysterious' detectives portrayed in crime literature. It was interesting to have the backstory of the police officer running through the book. Whilst this is not something I would have chosen to read myself, I am glad that I was able to discover Michael Stanley's writing as he has an incredible flair for describing the setting and the characters, meaning it is incredibly difficult not to like or become attached to the characters. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys thrillers, mysteries and crime stories. Although Dying to Live is different from the usual fast paced, action packed thrillers that are so readily available, it was definitely worth the read and is not short of suspense and has a thrilling conclusion. The exploration into the customs of other cultures and the practices of Witch Doctors is extremely interesting and may appeal to those interested in learning about other cultures."}, {"userName": "Jackie Law", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12763282-jackie-law", "userReview": "Dying to Live, by Michael Stanley, is the third book in the authors\u2019 Detective Kubu series to be published by Orenda. As with the previous instalments the imagery takes the reader into the heat and heart of Botswana where the books are set. Kubu masters his volatility better than before and less is made of his girth, although he continues to enjoy good food. His character, and that of his colleagues, add interest and depth but their varying foibles do not distract from the twists and turns in the plot. Witch doctor\u2019s and their muti \u2013 alternative medicines that require belief to have any effect \u2013 continue to play a significant role.The story opens with the death of a Bushman in a remote region of the country. He was a very old man who had been of interest to various foreigners due to his longevity. A prominent witch doctor is then reported missing in the town of Gaborone. There is nothing to link the two investigations until the names of the foreigners are found in the witch doctor\u2019s appointments book.Many in the police force despise the Bushmen and witch doctor\u2019s, although the latter are still widely feared. The investigations are not therefore approached with much enthusiasm, deaths of such people regarded as of no great loss. When a body is stolen from a morgue it is assumed the parts were wanted for muti. Kubu is unconvinced as that of a young girl, which would have been considered more valuable by practitioners of such dark hocus pocus, is left untouched.With so many aspects of the two cases remaining shrouded in secrecy by those potentially involved, Kubu is determined to get to the bottom of whatever is going on. What he uncovers goes beyond Botswana, and officials from abroad are not always willing to trust the integrity of their African counterparts.The integrity of all concerned is key. Backhanders are common and the desire for health and wealth, whatever the cost to others, widespread. When Kubu\u2019s daughter, Nono, reacts against her HIV medication and becomes seriously ill even his staunch belief in scientifically proven medication over muti is tested.The pace feels gentle despite the dark events unfolding but reader engagement is retained throughout.

So once again a big thumbs up to Orenda Books! I found this totally absorbing from the start. Set in Botswana it makes for a fascinating trip into the darker side of the area. Detective Kubu Bengu is an absolute delight and I took to him immediately, he and his partner Samantha Khama make a formidable team.The body of a bushman is discovered, it should just be another murder case until the autopsy reveals a peculiarity. While the man is elderly his organs resemble that of a much younger person. There was also a bullet lodged with no sign of scarring .. the investigation takes many twists and turns which involves Witch doctors and their Muti (alternative medicines).Not only are we taken on a journey to solve the mystery but also into Kubo\u2019s personal life. Family life is difficult when his young daughter becomes very poorly when she reacts to the HIV medicine. The emotions run high as he is torn between work and family. I found some of this highly tense but an essential part of the book. There is so much to learn about Africa, it\u2019s customs and I\u2019m intrigued by witch doctors so Dying To Live has opened my mind to research.This is a well written mystery which will entertain and intrigue you in equal measures. I\u2019m thrilled that I have discovered Kubo and will endeavour to catch up with the previous books for my pleasure, it certainly didn\u2019t feel necessary to read them prior to this one because it is all explained. It may be a complex subject but certainly an interesting one.My thanks to the authors, Orenda and Anne Cater for my copy which I read and reviewed voluntarily."}, {"userName": "Gloria Feit", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6469333-gloria-feit", "userReview": "The sixth in the series featuring detective Kubu (\u201chippopotamus\u201d in Setswana, the language of Botswana), this novel has an unusual plot: a secret plant indigenous to the desert, for which three men are murdered, is the basis for this mystery. The pathologist Dr. Ian MacGregor, who does the autopsy on a bushman found dead in the desert, discovers an aged body containing youthful organs. He calls Kubu when he suspects the man was murdered. It turns out the victim was a highly respected witch doctor who treated a variety of \u201cpatients\u201d with a secret potion promising a long life.Thus begins a long, complicated investigation, in which Kubu is assisted by the first female CID detective, a case that expands when another witch doctor turns up murdered and a visiting anthropologist from the United States goes missing. As if that\u2019s not enough to keep him busy, Kubu is confronted by another case in which controlled substances, powdered rhino horn, is being smuggled out of the country. Kubu suspects the two cases are inter-related.Just as important to this novel, as well as the series, is Kubu\u2019s home life, his relationship with his wife, Joy, and his daughter Tuni, and adopted daughter, Nono, who is HIV positive and suffers a breakdown causing considerable concern until a prescribed cocktail of medicines can be formulated to stabilize her condition. These aspects give the writing team who authored the book the opportunity to show how human Kubu is, as well as the detective\u2019s well-known appetite. Other constant features of the series are the atmosphere and characteristics of the Batswana (the people of the nation). We await the seventh novel in the series after recommending the sixth and current one."}, {"userName": "Kerrie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7475628-kerrie", "userReview": "As you can see from the list below, I have followed the development of thise series from the very beginning, and enjoyed Kubu's growth as a detective.As the average life span in the Western world increases, and our financial advisers carefully measure our pension plans against our life expectancy, it is interesting to note that there are some ethnic groups such as the Bushmen of the Kalahari where lifestyle and bush medicines ensure longevity. The body of the Bushman found in the Kalahari Game Reserve presents a puzzle: an unmistakeably old body containing surprisingly youthful looking organs. Nor has he, it seems, died of natural causes.Kubu finds that there are others missing too, and investigation shows that perhaps all the cases are related.If you are a follower of Precious Ramotswe you will have seen one side of the justice system in Botswana. It is interesting that in the Kubu novels the setting is also Botswana, and the two series often share locations. It is like having a coin with two different sides. However the Kubu novels are definitely not cozies, and yet both sets of novels refer to the current problems of this small African nation. And I enjoy both!I've also read5.0, A CARRION DEATH4.8, THE SECOND DEATH OF GOODLUCK TINUBU5.0, DEATH OF THE MANTIS5.0, DEADLY HARVEST4.5, DETECTIVE KUBU INVESTIGATES: a collection of short stories4.7, A DEATH IN THE FAMILY"}, {"userName": "Christina", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36636280-christina", "userReview": "Dark, draped in local customs, and a setting that envelops you, my third crime-solving fiction outing with Detective Kubu didn\u2019t disappoint.The body of an old Bushman is discovered, but the autopsy reveals youthful organs and an unexplained bullet.

Botswana, a huge, stunning country with a small population has, of course, two fine detective series all to itself \u2013 the stories of Alexander McCall Smith\u2019s Precious Ramotswe and Michael Stanley\u2019s Assistant Superintendent David \u2018Kubu\u2019 Bengu.Dying to Live is the latest featuring Kubu. The series has its charming side, but is a little darker than McCall Smith\u2019s stories. Kubu is Setswana for hippopotamus. He likes to slumber after a good meal, has a cosy family set-up with wife Joy and his two daughters. Tortured he is not, but nor is he docile, as we soon discover.Being a procedural, it begins with the discovery of a body. A bushman is found dead near the Central Kalahari Game Reserve. The death may have been accidental, but there is a puzzle \u2013 although the dead man was clearly pretty old, his internal organs look very young. And then there\u2019s the bullet in his muscle \u2013 where is the entry wound?The complex mystery will keep readers intrigued throughout, with the involvement of witch doctors, university academics, a private detective, Chinese gangsters and smugglers. While trying to untangle this, Kubu has a personal crisis to deal with, too, when his adopted daughter Nono falls ill and the Bengu marriage comes under strain.Michael Stanley gives us an enjoyable cast of characters, particularly Kubu\u2019s colleagues. Segodi is the lazy, conniving detective; Ian MacGregor\u2019s the Scottish forensic pathologist, who is Kubu\u2019s good friend; there is the earnest but effective Detective Samantha Khama; and finally there\u2019s his irascible boss, Director Mabaku.A slight criticism from this reviewer would be that, while the story is strongly fixed in its setting, I did not feel a real flavour of how remarkable Botswana is in the writing. But Dying to Live is certainly a skilfully plotted story of greed, the case is absorbing and the characters memorable. Had Mma Ramotswe not already been given the small-screen treatment, Kubu would surely be a contender for a series of his own."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34917926-james", "userReview": "This is the first of this writing duo\u2019s novel\u2019s I\u2019ve read (Michael Stanley actually being the writing team Michael Sears and Stanley Trollip) and is a continuation of their successful series of novels to feature Detective Kubu and his squad. I must confess to having the earlier two novels in the series on my Kindle but not having got around to reading them yet. Based on Dying to Live, I will now certainly make the time. While it is a series, the book can be read as a standalone as I did, and works as a self-contained story.Dying to Live begins with the discovery of an old Bushman, dead at the side of the road. Upon autopsy however it is discovered that the Bushman\u2019s organs are far younger than they should be. While the Bushman is extremely elderly, the organs are that of a young man. Later the body is stolen from the mortuary while a local witch doctor dealing in muti that promises to make people live for longer goes missing. Kubu and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of his, a Detective Samantha Khama, begin to investigate and soon find themselves involved in a labyrinthine case: An American anthropologist has gone missing, mysterious emails being sent to his wife; the boss of an American pharmaceutical company has hired a private detective to look for the anthropologist, who was hanging around with the now dead bushman; rhino horn smugglers, Chinese embassy officials, all are somehow drawn into the web. If all this sounds complex it is, but the plotting is deftly handled and the authors never lose their grasp of the multiple threads. It all comes together nicely in a finely drawn denouement. The characterisation of Kubu and his colleagues is also well handled. On the front cover of Dying to Live is a quote from Peter James comparing the novel to McCall Smith (the author of the populr No1 Ladies Detective Agency series of books). Peter James says Michael Stanley\u2019s novels have \u201ca darker edge and an even darker underbelly\u201d. While this is true, I found Dying to Live still a lot more upbeat than most other noir novels. Even though the novel touches on the use of human body parts in Muti (from what I gather, earlier novels in the series focus on this more) the book is not grim or a difficult read. And herein lies the problem for me. I like my books darker and more nourish. Sorry, that\u2019s just how I like \u2018em. So, while Dying to Live is a great book and well worth a read, it just didn\u2019t pack the punch that I normally like.That said, this is certainly a well written procedural with compelling characters. I certainly will make the time to read the earlier instalments and look forward to reading what the authors pen next."}, {"userName": "Clair", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6583076-clair", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book; both for its plot and it's location. Michael Stanley transports us to Botswana when a Bushman is found dead near the\u00a0Central Kalahari Game Reserve. During the autopsy, it is found that this man was only old on the outside as his internal organs are like those of a 40-year-old.Whilst Detective 'Kubu' Bengu is assigned to the mysterious death, his colleague Detective Samantha Khama is assigned to the disappearance of a local well-known witch doctor - simple coincidence or is there something more sinister going on? Kubu and Khama are both extremely sceptical when it comes to alternative medicine so these are difficult cases for them to investigate as they need to put aside their personal opinions in search of justice....especially when the Bushman's death seems less likely to be an accident after the body is stolen from the morgue and disappears!The various strands in this story were fascinating, not only in terms of where it led the plot but also to learn more about Bushmen and witch doctors. I really enjoyed the dual plot lines as they were both full investigations within their own right by Kubu and Khama but also brought into question links between the two. I adored Kubu, he's a wonderful straight talking officer who is a family man first and foremost and I enjoyed his rapport with Khama - they make a good team, they compliment each other.Dying to Live is one of those books that can be devoured in one sitting. I must admit it took me by surprise how gripping it was. I'll be honest, I'm not a massive fan of Alexander McCall Smith's No.1 Ladies Detective Agency series as I find them a little too laid back and 'cosy' therefore I started this book with a little trepidation due to the comparisons between the two. However, I am extremely pleased to say that this trepidation was completely unwarranted - whilst I can see where the comparisons arise, Dying to Live\u00a0has a wonderful dark side which is just fascinating. I have the 2 books that precede this one (Deadly Harvest\u00a0and A Death in the Family)\u00a0sitting unread on my bookcase (hangs head in shame!) which I am now most definitely bumping them up the TBR list!A brilliant police procedural, a wonderful setting in Botswana - a fantastic introduction to 'sunshine noir'."}, {"userName": "Jacob Collins", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39569183-jacob-collins", "userReview": "All of my reviews can be found at: https://jacob-reviews-books.blogspot....Dying to Live is the sixth book in the Detective Kubu series by Michael Stanley. Although this is the first book by Michael Stanley which I have read, I didn\u2019t have any trouble in getting into the story and it can be read as a standalone, if you are new to the series as well. But once you have finished this one, you\u2019ll want to go back and read them all. It reminded me of the television show Death in Paradise on BBC One and I could instantly see the series appeal as a TV drama.In the latest installment, the discovery of the body of an elderly bushman stumps detectives assigned to the case. An autopsy report reveals that the man\u2019s organs are surprisingly young which can\u2019t be possible. Detective Kubu does not believe in medicines and \u2018magic\u2019 created by Witch doctors but the autopsy revelations trouble him. But when the body is stolen from the morgue and a local witch doctor disappears he knows that this is going to be much more than a simple case. And who is the mysterious American anthropologist who also disappears under a shroud of mystery?Dying to Live is another corker of a read from Orenda books. I really liked Detective Kubu and he seemed like a breath of fresh air compared to a lot of fictional police detectives out there. I also liked his colleague Samantha, and in my personal opinion, she was my favourite character from the book. She was the first woman detective on the team and she often has to stand up for herself. I liked her determination to see a case through, even though, if perhaps, it is one she would rather not be investigating.This novel is packed with plenty of twists and turns, I also found Kubu\u2019s family life interesting and heartbreaking at times. Kubu\u2019s daughter was born with HIV and he and his wife are left at their wits end when she falls dangerously ill. Kubu must manage to keep track of what is happening with the investigation whilst worrying about his daughter and his own family at the same time.A really enjoyable read, the detective Kubu series is definitely one to watch.

It is set in Botswana and as my only experience of crime fiction set in this part of the world is \"The No 1 Ladies Detective Agency\" I was in for a bit of a shock! This is not cozy crime - it most definitely is noir fiction and it is gritty, dangerous, fascinating and full of threatening situations and characters. I was gripped by the opening when a body of a bushman is discovered - the body of an old man who seems to have very young organs. The autopsy reveals an old bullet is lodged in the man's body which immediately throws up a whole host of other issues, questions and intrigue. I was gripped as the plot continued to unfold and introduce a missing local witch doctor. The inclusion of this character really fascinated me and I enjoyed the time spent by the characters chatting about this part of the culture and heritage. It's all necessary for driving the action forward but also appealed to my imagination. I enjoyed this book and I liked the characters. I felt it was well crafted, well written, easy to follow and that the complex storyline was well managed. It was great to read a new detective series set in a part of the world I knew nothing about. It captures the sense of location, time and place so effectively while simultaneously creating a storyline that adheres to all the rules and conventions of noir fiction. I think it works well as a stand alone and there is a glossary of characters and a map at the beginning of the book which is always appreciated. There is a glossary with a few translations of words at the end but honestly this didn't bother me when I was reading. I think the growth of European and International noir has meant that we are often reading books with unfamiliar names and actually it is perfectly possible to keep track of everyone and everything when you have a book that is well written and well structured. This would be a good holiday read for those who enjoy travel and enjoy reading stories set in exotic locations but also for anyone who enjoys a fast paced, action packed, crime novel with a fair level of darkness and threat!"}], "description": "A Bushman is discovered dead near the Central Kalahari Game Reserve.
