I finished this book in one day and resented whatever chore took me away from reading. I absolutely loved spending time with these characters and the town of Walton. It made me a bit nostalgic for my childhood days and upbringing. I lived in a small town where everyone knew you and your parents. If you were misbehaving your mom knew about it before you could bicycle home. There's much to be said for a small town life and that feeling of a community as an extended family. I grew to really care about Cassie as she came to terms with her past hurts and regrets. The book was filled with characters that were authentic and many I would love to have as friends. As I finished the last page I sighed with satisfaction...another solid book from Karen White.Recommend? Yes...y'all need to read this one...fantastic southern fiction with a great cast of characters. This book will make you emotional.....read it!"}, {"userName": "Kim Justice", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2264963-kim-justice", "userReview": "For the most part, the plot was entirely predictable (and seemed like a pretty close cousin to \"Sweet Home Alabama\"). But it was so beautifully written, that I let the author take me there. Even if I saw what was coming, I still wanted to be swept away into the world that White creates. White does \"Southern\" very well, both aptly poking fun at some of the things we do and yet maintaining the integrity of the things we southerners hold so dear."}, {"userName": "Melody", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2410636-melody", "userReview": "After having read a few Karen White books, I have to confess that I have fallen in love with her writing style and how her stories always seem to warm and touches my heart. Needless to say, when the publicist contacted me and asked if I would like to review Karen White's Falling Home, I didn't even have to think about it. As the title indicated, Falling Home is a coming home story. However, there are more to it than about just having the protagonist coming home; it is also a story about forgiveness and acceptance, and of finding oneself along the journey. Cassie Madison often thinks of herself as a city girl despite that she was born and raised in Walton, Georgia until an incident had deeply humiliated her and she had vowed never to return. That humiliation was seeing the guy she liked had chosen to marry her younger sister, Harriet. Cassie left for New York and began her life thereafter. For a while she feels happy since she has a great career in advertising and a fianc\u00e9 whom she thinks she loves until she received a telephone call from her estranged sister one day, informing her that their father is dying and they want her to come home.Cassie does not want to admit this to anyone, but deep in her heart she is afraid of seeing Harriet and Joe again. Despite this, she knew she has to return to Walton anyhow. As much as she tries to forget her unhappy past, what she didn't expect is she has grown to love her nephews and nieces the more she stays in Walton, and how much the place still means to her after all these years. During the stay, Cassie will also find out the secret which Cassie's father had kept and how it will mean to her after discovering the truth eventually. Falling Home is one of Karen White's older releases and I was so glad that her publisher decided to reissue the book after seeing that many readers had asked about it (I definitely hope that they will print her other older releases as well). While nothing much has changed to the story, Karen did a little revamp and added two new points of view (Harriet and her daughter, Maddie) instead of Cassie's. Reading about their perspectives has made me understand more about their emotions and their stand and I felt these have further enriched the story in my opinion. Although the story might not be new, what I really enjoyed reading this book is the characterisations and finding out how much Cassie has grown and a changed person after all the experiences she has been through. Speaking of characterisations, Karen has done a great job in portraying the feelings and emotions from the three point of views but I felt there also should be more emphasis from Joe's view. Karen must have her reason for keeping Joe in the background and though I totally respect her choice, but being a reader I would like to know more about his thoughts and how he felt about everything. Nevertheless, Falling Home is an engaging read and one that made me think of the fact that no place is anywhere like home."}, {"userName": "Krissy ", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4970024-krissy", "userReview": "Imagine a Hallmark movie, but as a book. If you don't know what I mean by that, let me assure you that the Hallmark channel has tons of movies that center around some of these same themes: big city is bad, career-oriented thinking is bad...well, you get the picture. The following quote stunned me:\"Her MBA training and years of working in New York had taught her to ignore the twinge of conscience.\"All this time, I thought an MBA was an accomplishment for the hard-working and disciplined, but now I see it just numbs your sense of right and wrong. Eating sushi is elitist, broadening your horizons leads to ramming a giant stick up your ass and losing your sense of humor, and God forbid you move away from your family...even if your sister did elope with your boyfriend. Don't be selfish and stand in the way of true love!Love interest Sam has his Harvard education, but brought it back to his home town and spends the book sneering at/lecturing Cassie (Cassandra in New York...New Yorkers apparently frown on nicknames) for the way she changed, and insists that she makes him glad he left Boston before the obligatory stick-ramming. That what they taught in Harvard? The contrast for him is Andrew, another favored Hallmark archetype, the successful but soul-less, uptight, pompous jerk who hates kids, old people, and anything not business-related. It takes the heroine inexplicably long to realize said-jerkiness...because she's too busy insisting he's right for her, clearly illustrating what she'll become unless she does what everyone around her thinks she should. Obviously I had a lot of problems with the messages in this book. I also thought the beginning was pretty confusing as to what exactly were the main conflicts of the book, because it would introduce one conflict (I've been estranged from my sister for 15 years and now I have to go home again)and then quickly resolve the conflict within a chapter or two (I just realized I'm not mad anymore and I was wrong to be mad in the 1st place...we're cool, sis). There were at least 3 or 4 false starts before it moves on to the actual story.About half-way through the book there's a mystery introduced, which couldn't have interested me less. I just kept speeding forward to find out what happened to Harriet...her story did end up interesting me, hence the second star. I don't mind two-dimensional, predictable chick-lit because it can be comforting, like mac-n-cheese. I do mind stereotypes."}, {"userName": "Andrea", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27117435-andrea", "userReview": "I thought I was the target audience for this book. Ahhhhh....something about jumping ship from your current circumstances and finding (or in this case, rediscovering) a new, simpler life somewhere else, is incredibly appealing to me. (I'm not ready to analyze why! :) Yet, this book missed the mark. I listened and listened to 15 and a half long hours of a winding plot and repeated sentences. Did I mention how LONG it felt? The best stories are those where you wince as the pages fly by, because you never want the fabulousness to end.

I find that it is a very narrow road for me, whether I will like a book or not, and I am not the kind of person who enjoys simply saying \"I do not like this book,\" because someone took the time and energy to create the characters and the story and write it. Inevitably there are people who will like it, it's just in that instant, it wasn't me. This is a horrible way to preface this entry, because this is not what happened with this book. I am so very thankful I decided to say yes to this book. Technically, this book isn't exactly a new book, it was first published in 2002, but has been reworked and is being republished November 2, 2010. Falling Home was one of those books I hated to put down. Fortunately [and unfortunately] I got a stomach bug, stayed home from work and had an entire day to lay around reading it, so it wasn't really a problem.Cassie is returning home to her small hometown in Georgia after 15 years away, returning to a life she has left behind. A life where her younger sister went off and eloped with her first love, and where the small town hustle and bustle has everyone knowing your business. She is reluctant to go back, but her father has suffered a heart attack and is not expected to make it, his dying wish is to have both of his daughters at home with him. According to Cassie, the only thing waiting for her at Walton is her past. What she does not expect to find is a community, a family, a life that she never knew she was missing, and who welcome her home with open arms. I absolutely fell in love with this book! The characters are beautiful and fun. I did feel like I was reading the book version of Sweet Home Alabama at first because of the 'big-time girl going back to small-town life' story line, but there is so much more to this story about love and life, and learning from your past mistakes, and moving forward from past hurts. The book had me laughing, and crying and wanting to grab my kids and keep them as close to me as possible. I loved how Karen White was able to create a picture that I could visualize and made me want it for myself. I could just see the old houses, the porch swings, and hear old porch doors slamming against the frame. I wanted to run in a field and catch lightening bugs, and be wrapped up in this community, even with it's downfalls. There were a few times I was actually wishing I was listening to an audio book, just so I could hear Sam's southern accent, which I imagined to be super sexy when he wanted it to be, and ultra-hick when he wanted it to as well. I would have loved to have been able to hear some of Cassie and Sam's verbal battles."}, {"userName": "Dee Gurganus", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4881101-dee-gurganus", "userReview": "There are so many stories of girl leaves home to escape something then comes back due to some tragedy. Why do I keep reading them? Ms White's \"Falling Home\" is an excellent reason why. I was first intrigued when I read the author's notes that the edition I was reading was a release of a previous version that she updated. But the character development was so will done and the story line so intense that it held me hanging on every page. Cassie is a single career girl who left home when her sister eloped with her boyfriend (who wouldn't want to escape after that). She returned to Walton, GA when her father was seriously ill and died. To her surprise her father left her the family house; requiring her to stay longer. The male main character is Sam, the not-so-proper in high school guy who is now the handsome, level headed town doctor. The struggle with family, romance, and small town living makes this story well worth reading.

It got hard for me to put the novel down. Cassie Madison had lived the past 15 years in Mannhatan, establishing new life and advertising with her fiancee, Andrew.

However, Sam and Harriet think that she should stay, that Walton is where she belongs.Karen White did an amazing job. I loved the fact how she wrote the book in diffrent point of view. It didn't have a single moment where the book didn't capture my attention, the moment that i picked up the book, i didn't want to put it back down again. I fell in love with characters, especially Cassie, Sam & Harriet. The realthionship between Harriet & Cassie had so much tension in begnning, i could see that in begnning Cassie still haven't completly forgiven Harriet for taking the love of her life, away from her. As Novel progressed, especially when Harriet got sick, i saw the sisters getting closer and closer, especially when they started going through their father things. I loved the realthionship between Sam & Cassie as well. I could tell that there was an attraction as well as tension between the two of them from very begnning. I was hoping that the two of them would get together, soon. I wasn't too fond of Andrew, i could tell that he wasn't the guy for her, from the moment he came to Georgia. All he seemed to care about was work, he didn't even try to comfort her after her father's death. Work seemed more important to him then Cassie, her hapiness. This novel made me sad, it hit close to home. My grandma got diagnosed with breast cancer when i was 11 and died when i was 16. When Harriet died, it reminded me of my grandma and it made me cry, both for my grandma and because i loved Harriet. It was an emotional novel from begnning but there were also parts that made me smile. I recomend this novel to everyone.

Not a ringing endorsement, I know. Sounded somewhat interesting when I picked it up at the library, but it was just a predictable, cheesy mess sometimes. How many stories have this same plot: small town girl, traumatic event, leaves small town, goes to big city, \"makes something of herself\", returns to small town for whatever reason as a high-fashion, too-good-for-this NYC snob, falls in love with local guy and small town again, has epiphany about life and family and roots, ends up staying. The end.Halfway through this book I wanted to quit reading it, but I hate getting that far and not seeing it through, so I kept going. There were a few moments that were good, but overall it just wasn't great. The main character was hard to like--snobby, snippy, bitchy, and half the stuff that came out of her mouth would never be uttered in real life. I mean, does anyone actually call people by their full name, as in \"Sam Parker, you don't know anything about me.\" \"I love you, Sam Parker.\" Barf.The writing is definitely mediocre at best. The phrase \"with studied nonchalance\" was used not once, not twice, but three times in a span of less than 20 pages. It was used twice in TWO pages. If you're going to use a phrase like that, don't overkill it. At one point, a character \"stomps his toe in the dirt\"...but they are driving in a car, so...??? What??? Whoops.

I love the way she writes of problems that we all encounter in everyday life and how many, but not all of these problems can be overcome. Falling Home is the story of two sisters: Cassie Madison who returns to her small home town of Walton, GA after being in NYC for 15 years and the other sister Harriet who stayed and married and was raising six children. The story incorporates the good with the bad of living in a small town, and the reader is taken on a journey of forgiveness, redemption, love, and carrying on in life.It took me a while to really feel incorporated into the story, but once I did, I couldn't put it down.

Great chick lit. Quotes: Only bad news came at three in the morning. Births and engagements were always announced in the bright light of day. But bad news came at night, as if the sun were already in mourning. He said that Georgia dirt would always stick to the soles of my shoes, regardless of how many elocution lessons I took. She studied the endless asphalt stretched out in front of her, the dotted line like a yellow brick road to follow home. He said it was okay to be chasing the rainbow's end, as long as I always remembered where the rainbow started. And when you're finished burning all your bridges, we'll still be here, waiting to help you back across. There's lots of ways to die that don't involve physical death. Sometimes she thought Cassie had been born with all that hurt buried deep inside her. Small hurts that are allowed to fester sometimes seem to grow out of all proportion. Her pale fingers opened wide as if to capture some of the milky night air and some of the wistfulness that seemed to stir up from the dark road and push at her temples. Damn, he was good-looking--better-looking than such an annoying man had any right to be. Love is all about sacrifices--big and small ones. It's only when you know how much you could give up for somebody that you know what true love really is. Falling into his arms was like falling home, a return to a place held precious and dear. Life's full of decisions like that, and there's no book of rules that tells you how to play. You make the best decision you can at the time, and deal with the rest. The woman had unseen radar that could detect a broken heart or hurt feelings from over a mile away. Well, you get out of bed, you eat your grits, say hey to your neighbors, you give extra love to her children, and you live your life. The sun is a pretty stubborn guy, and he'll rise each day just to spite you. But life does go on. Sometimes you have to reach deep down in your heart and decide what road you're going to take. And all choices involve some sort of sacrifice. But in the end, you know whether or not you made the right decision. Home no longer seemed like a place where one was born, and then outgrew, along with skinned knees and childhood dreams. Instead, it seemed to her, it was a place that lived in one's heart, waiting with open arms to be rediscovered."}, {"userName": "Lorrie", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5142243-lorrie", "userReview": "Cassie is the main heroine and she is flawed, spoiled and repugnant; however, the reader will learn to look past these flaws in character and become attached to her anyway.

This time, however, I found myself rolling my eyes quite a bit, especially over the relationship between Cassie and San. Sam is an overbearing douche canoe who forces her to say \"y'all, fried chicken, and sweet tea\" before he will sleep with her, like she's some kind of southern sex robot. I didn't like the shifting perspectives within the same chapter. Sometimes you'd get Harriett, Cassie, and Maddie all within a few pages. I also wasn't a fan of the way Harriett got cancer while pregnant and died. Not because it was poorly done, but because my best friend died nearly the exact same way a year ago, and it hit a little too close to home.

According to Goodreads, this is the seventh book of hers that I have read. Falling Home was first published in 2002, and after revisions, it was re-released in 2010. It was interesting to read something she had written so long ago, and I could see that even then, she used some of the same plot devices. In The Color of Light she used old letters and a child's treasure box to help tell the story. In The Lost Hours she used old scrapbooks and a box buried in the backyard in much the same way. In Learning to Breathe the main character wears different saints medals depending on her mood and the demons she plans to battle that day. In this book, Cassie, the main character, finds old letters in the attic that lead her to a decades-old family mystery. She also wears a necklace with hearts and a key that symbolizes she is the keeper of hearts for her family. This is the story of Cassie, who left her small hometown with a broken heart when her sister Harriet eloped with Cassie's fianc\u00e9. In the fifteen years since, Cassie has recreated herself in New York City, and has become estranged from most of her family. She returns to Walton, Georgia, because her aged father is sick, and she is forced to look at all she lost when she left. She makes peace with her sister, gets to know her sister's family, and becomes reacquainted with Sam, a childhood friend who is now the local doctor. Another sickness in the family causes her to choose between going back to her life in NYC or staying in Walton. The way she wrestles between these two lives was very compelling for me, probably because in my family, I am the sister who moved away, while my sister raises her family in a small town thirty minutes from where we grew up. Although I really liked this book, two things prevented me from giving it more stars. First of all, it could have been much better written--I'm glad I read the revised version rather than the original one. White tells us a lot of things rather than shows us, making her characters seem a bit predictable and one-dimensional. Also, the romance thread just did not work for me. Sam continually badgers Cassie about all she gave up when she left and bashes her over the head with all the virtues of small town life--it was hard to see why she finally fell for him. I felt the same way about Melanie and Jack in White's The House on Tradd Street--they bickered so continuously that it was hard to believe that they were actually getting together. And in both books, White keep the turning point in both relationships off the page, so you don't get to see the final resolution. Still, there is something wonderful about her books that make me want to stop everything to read them. Her portrayals of small town life make me, the city-mouse sister, want to crawl inside them. And that's while I'll keep reading until I've read all of Karen White's books."}, {"userName": "Bookaholics", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1554860-bookaholics", "userReview": "Falling Home by Karen WhiteContemporary Romance -Nov. 2nd, 20103 1/2 starsWhen Cassie\u2019s sister, Harriett, eloped with Cassie\u2019s fiance, Cassie left Walton, Georgia and never looked back. For fifteen years, Cassie stayed in New York, burying herself with work and reinvented herself. She got rid of her Southern accent and her penchant for eating fried foods.

Now fifteen years later, her father is dying and Cassie has no choice but to go back home to Georgia and face her sister, her ex-fiance (who is now her brother-in-law), and their five children. But underneath the stylish haircut, the fashionable clothes, and new accent, can Cassie find the heart and courage to forgive her sister? Will her father\u2019s doctor, the cute Dr. Sam, help Cassie rediscover the carefree, fun-loving person she was?This novel is strictly chick-lit with a light dash on romance. Falling Home is more about Cassie rediscovering her relationship with her sister, Harriett. Still, Falling Home by White is an interesting book set in a vivid world that pop out from the pages. You can almost feel the scorching heat from the Georgian summer and smell the magnolia from Cassie\u2019s backyard. The only part that I didn\u2019t enjoy reading was, unfortunately, Cassie herself. For the first half of the book, Cassie was a little unlikeable for me. I really wanted her to 'wake' up when she still refused to forgive her sister at her father\u2019s deathbed, and instead whined and pouted about how Harriett took her guy away from her. (It was fifteen years ago! Get over it!) At that point, her obstinacy and selfishness were too much for me. But I soldiered on and was pleasantly surprised when Cassie becomes a softer, caring person towards the end of the book. Dr. Sam most certainly helped sweeten her up.If you are looking for a touching chick-lit that focuses more on the importance of familial relationships, you should definitely give Falling Home a try. Half-way through the book, you will swear that you\u2019ve been transported to Walton, Georgia, a charming, small town where people bake you pies and put things in your house if you leave it unlocked.Reviewed by Pauline from Bookaholics Romance Club"}, {"userName": "Darla", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8179422-darla", "userReview": "Oh man! What to say about this book?! I really enjoyed it! It was a really sweet story, sometimes awkward, sometimes romantic, sometimes frustrating, but still very good. This book centers around Cassie and her baby sister Harriet. We do get another POV from Harriet's oldest daughter, Maddie too. The cast of characters were pretty cool; the rest of Harriet's brood, her husband, Aunt Lucinda, and Dr. Sam Parker and his parents actually. And can I just say, 'hello gorgeous' to the good doctor by the way! There is something special and warming about a southern man, accent and all!! And I'm not saying that because I'm a southern woman, but a woman in general ;-) Anyway, Cassie was a hoot, her mouth and the pranks she'd played when she was younger were crazy, even as they were a cry for help. I liked her sister Harriet too, who never gave up hope that one day her and her big sister would reconcile after a serious fallout/betrayal 15 years prior that had Cassie running hell bent out of Georgia for New York, never looking back. It was unfortunate what it took to get Cassie back to Georgia, and even more so, for what caused her to stick around longer than she'd intended, but in the end I think it helped her heal her old festering wounds and really open her eyes to see who she'd become and who she really wanted to be. I have to say, that because the story switched between Cassie's, or Harriet's, or Maddie's POV seemingly within the same sentence darn near, it sometimes threw me off who was talking until you understood which female it was based on what she was saying. I would totally suggest this book to anyone, but I warn you now, especially if you are a crybaby like me.

He made me laugh when he went all \"southern\" and \"slow\" when he was meeting Andrew, Cassie's fianc\u00e9.I thought the narrator did a fine job. I read a review that downed her southern accent, but not knowing the finer points of a Georgian accent, it did not bother me in the least. The voice for her characters was well done. I'd certainly listen to any book she narrated. I'm only sad I won't be able to listen to the follow up to this book - After The Rain, as it is not available to me on Audible. I'll be reading it though!."}, {"userName": "Linda Day", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2572274-linda-day", "userReview": "What did I think ? I think this was a 2-3 borderline. Had I read this first, I never would have read \"On Folly Beach\" which was a favorite 2011 of mine.Ms. White says that this is a rewritten version of this earlier published book of hers. That does not speak well of the first !It is, basically, the story of the on again, off again romance between Cassie and Sam, the reunion of Cassie w/her sister,and small-town life with all it's charm and frustrations. There is death. There is teen-aged angst. There is a cowboy and his dog. There is the evil big-city boyfriend as well as the evil small town bad guy. All these told with such lines as : \"Thanks Cassie. You're a peach !\"Not a peach of a book, though !"}, {"userName": "Yasmin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/687724-yasmin", "userReview": "Falling Home is an entertaining, delightful, yet predicable, happily ever read. If you enjoy books set in the South, small town settings where everyone knows your name, filled with Southern Belles, rednecks as deemed by other white folks, genteel types, lots of drama, and melodrama galore then I definitely recommend Falling Home to you. However, I must warn you that one of the sisters will get on your last nerves and the author's overuse of family guilt to make a point became annoying as well. Overall, I enjoyed the read because it was mindless and I must admit that when I want to just veg out and not think when I'm reading I know that I can count on Karen White's books to take me to that place."}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1696435-lori", "userReview": "Andi Schrishuhn, I am cracking up! Glass Castle, glass castle...I can't wait to discuss this at book club. I did not think this was TERRIBLE! I mean, I finished it. Matter of fact, I finished it in just a couple of days.Love the movie Sweet Home Alabama. Stop and watch it almost any time I see it on TV. This book had a similar story, HOWEVER, the main character never really grew on me. I loved Sam (I picture him being super sexy), loved Harriet and Joe, and loved Maddie. The story line of Harriet is really what kept me interested in the book. The \"mystery\" part of the book was almost a humorous addition, and the part with Ed at the end... Aye, Aye, Aye... I better wait to say anything more."}, {"userName": "Ann", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4116512-ann", "userReview": "Meh. Too predictable. Too hokey. Too \"aren't all Southern towns quaint and aren't all Southerners the friendliest, down-home folks.\" And the love interest is a hot doctor? Come on. What I want to know, since I've been rating a lot of books lately with only two and three stars, is who are the editors??? What are they letting get published? What are their standards? I'd love to have an editors job. I'd love to read for a living but believe me, I'd be passing judgement and making recommendations for tighter story lines and I wouldn't assume that every female author has a female audience that wants to read Romance novels.

I'm undecided as to whether I'd recommend it to a friend as the first third or half of the book was Sweet Home Alabama 2.0 and I knew at the beginning of the book what was going to happen to main character so it was predictable. That said the author did throw in 2-3 twists and turns I didn't expect and there's a mystery thread I found appealing. In the end, this book entertained me and it's sometimes nice to read a somewhat simple book of love and family and finding home."}, {"userName": "Sue", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9795327-sue", "userReview": "4.5, enjoyed the audio and the story. I feel like I'm reading a Nicholas Spark's Cousin. But it contains happier moments than those do which makes them addictive rather than... a point of avoidance.Two sister's separate by a hurtful act, come together to mourn their father. Things change immediately and at one point I thought it was a little to unrealistic. Sometimes the hurts take more time to heal, but I'm glad they ripped off the bandaid at least in stages.

No such luck. The main character was not very likable and the situations EXTREMELY unrealistic. This is a rewrite of a book the author originally wrote 10 years earlier. She said she was so much happier with this one because she removed the melodrama from it. Um...nope. My first and last Karen White book. The mystery is why I hung in there through all 437 pages of this. Probably for the sensation that by the last couple of chapters I truly wanted to fling it through the wall."}, {"userName": "Nurlely", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4114912-nurlely", "userReview": "I think the story is beautiful. I like reading how the characters interact with each other. Knoxie is adorable and although Maddie is a confused girl, she is naturally kind. The love story is rather predictable but sweet. Harriet's death's impact is a bit sugar-coated for me. everything seems to work just fine after she was gone and Lucinda took over the mother's job. Or maybe because the story is about to end it gives nothing more than that.For the overall, I like the book."}, {"userName": "Jenn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3349239-jenn", "userReview": "I fell in love with this book. It made me laugh, it made me flat out bawl my eyes out and it made me happy. This is a great book and a very clean book. I would recommend this to anyone.

I like the love story that plays out in this book and the relationships the main character builds with her sister's children and I like what she discovers about herself in the end."}], "description": "From the New York Times bestselling author   Revised and expanded for this new trade paperback edition, Karen White's novel tells a poignant story of two estranged sisters. At twenty Cassie Madison left her hometown of Walton, Georgia, for New York City, where she has reinvented herself-from losing herself in her career to squashing her accent. But one night a single phone call brings back everything she's tried to forget. She hasn't spoken to her sister since Harriet stole Cassie's fianc\u00e9 and married him. But now Harriet's on the line with news that their father is dying.  As she makes the trip back, the only thing that frightens Cassie more than losing her father is seeing Harriet and the family that should have been hers. But she can't help loving her nephews and nieces any more than she can help feeling at home again in Walton. As she fights a surprising reaction to a forgotten friend, and faces an unexpected threat to the family she'd once left behind, Cassie comes to realize that moving on doesn't always mean moving away from who you are.", "title": "Falling Home\n      \n          (Falling Home #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7958192-falling-home", "average": 3.93, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1442784660l/7958192.jpg", "reviews": 596, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/160033.Karen_White", "name": "Karen   White"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Womens Fiction", "Romance", "Contemporary"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7958192-falling-home", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9954179-falling-home", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/701417.Falling_Home", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9339654-falling-home", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9555068-falling-home", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35218167-falling-home", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4505161-the-house-on-tradd-street", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23398961-the-sound-of-glass", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10283872-the-beach-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7250052-on-folly-beach", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6330979-the-girl-on-legare-street"]}
