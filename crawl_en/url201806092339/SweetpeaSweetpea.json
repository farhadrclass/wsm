It is told in a dry witty style. She make lists of things that drive her around the bend or people she wants to kill. They are spot on! Hugely entertaining. Bloody marvellous. She has a dark side. From time to time, she kills people. She is kind to animals and children though. Probably best to be nice to her eh?!

Skuse turns to her darker side in penning this piece, rich in angst and homicidal actions. Rhiannon Lewis hates her life and most of those who cross her path. Using a series of diary entries, she explores this hatred by tipping her hand to the reader. Many of her entries begin with a list of those she despises the most and why they rub her the wrong way. Be it people from the news, those at her place of employment, or people with whom she must interact in public, Rhiannon cannot let things flow off her back. As the narrative progresses, the reader learns that Rhiannon was once famous for being the sole survivor in a horrific attack on a daycare facility, though she suffered significant injuries. These injuries seem to have numbed her ability to truly care for others, while also helping to foster a sense of vigilante behaviour, which she uses to restore balance in the world. Rhiannon has many secrets, but none darker than the need to punish those who have wronged the innocent and to harm people who do not serve a useful purpose in her day to day life. The narrative is full of these struggles and the list of personal enemies that Rhiannon finds troublesome seems to grow as time passes. That being said, a personal event turns everything on its head and forces Rhiannon to reassess her life and the choices she\u2019s made; a new feeling for this seemingly cold and emotionless woman. Whatever the struggle, Rhiannon Lewis will not be the same by the end, though no one can truly tell how she\u2019ll turn out. Skuse offers a very dark and demented path through this novel, sure to interest those who enjoy personal struggle and protagonists with deep and homicidal secrets.I chose this book on the recommendation of a friend, who knows how much I enjoy a twisted tale. I was not entirely sure what to expect, but did hope for some psychological thriller that would keep me up well into the night. Instead, I pushed through this personal journal of a twenty-something woman who has a hit list a mile long and many deep secrets she wants to keep from others. Rhiannon is quite the repulsive character, particularly because of her attitude towards the outside world. As she mentions throughout the narrative, she has a \u2018me\u2019 side and a public persona to uphold, a difficult act to support through troubling times. However, her Dexter-like duality might serve to better underscore her struggles on a daily basis. The reader cannot help but feel a ray of sympathy for her, though surely dislikes her ongoing attacks on anyone who is not perfect. With a cast of varied secondary characters, Skuse is able to prop up her novel with a vast array of fodder to fuel Rhiannon\u2019s fire, though no one can be sure when things will take a significant turn. The story itself is decent, though there are surely segments that drag and left me wondering how long it would take to push through. This is definitely not a fast-paced piece, nor is it something with mysterious crumbs left throughout the narrative. The reader must dedicate themselves to getting to the very end, where more surprises lie in wait. I am happy to say I made it, though the journey was anything but simple. Still, Skuse kept me wondering and guessing, with some significantly curious means of tying up loose ends by the final few entries.Kudos, Madam Skuse, for a great piece, which differs greatly from your usual fare. I am eager to see what else you might bring up for publishing in the coming years. I know I\u2019ll keep an eye open!Love/hate the review?

Profanity very much necessary; if you don't think I needed to use 'fucking' in that sentence, you definitely shouldn't read this book.If there are awards for 'x meets x' descriptions in book blurbs, some HQ copywriter deserves the equivalent of an Oscar for hitting on 'Fleabag meets American Psycho'. Part journal, part internal monologue, replete with swearing and ironically deployed slang, Sweetpea chronicles the uncensored thoughts and confessions of Rhiannon. An editorial assistant in her late twenties, she's frank and gleefully non-PC about her sex life, cheating boyfriend, boring job/friends, weirdo colleagues/neighbours... and the fact that she's a serial killer. That's right: when she isn't fantasising about offing her patronising boss or reordering the list of people she most wants to murder, Rhiannon gets her kicks by going out at night with her Sabatier knife and seeking suitable victims.What makes this work? It helps that Rhiannon is oddly relatable and endearing. Aside from the murder thing, her life is so normal, right down to the fact that she shops at Lidl. She's smart and funny but hamstrung by ordinary frustrations: friends who talk about nothing but their kids; a promotion that never materialises; a nagging feeling that she 'needs' to lose weight. And on a deep, sick level, isn't Rhiannon just living every misanthrope's dream? Instead of running away from a would-be rapist, she plays along until she gets the chance to... well, I won't go into it, but it definitely makes her worthy of the 'female Patrick Bateman' label. She extracts prolonged, violent revenge on the girl who made her life hell at school. She doesn't have to suffer Tube perverts because she can threaten to slit their throats (and give them a glimpse of the knife to back it up). And if we've all mentally sketched out our kill lists every now and then, well, Rhiannon might just follow through on hers.There may be a lot of blood and a bit of a dive into Rhiannon's troubled past, but this is definitely more black comedy than thriller. (There's also quite a bit of sex. Sweetpea is basically what I imagine that book Maestra would have been like if it was actually entertaining.) Rhiannon's blunt-and-breezy voice is a masterstroke, and her kill lists (Regina George meets The Bride? Adrian Mole meets Dexter?) repeatedly made me laugh out loud. I found it so hilarious, and loved Rhiannon so much, that the rating could have been five stars \u2013 but I was disappointed in a development towards the end, and the out-of-character behaviour that results in the wimpy ending.Still an ENORMOUS amount of fun, though. Sweetpea is nearly 500 pages, but I flew through it in no time, pausing only to note down my favourite Rhiannon one-liners. Now I just need a sequel and a true-to-the-book film version.I received an advance review copy of Sweetpea from the publisher through NetGalley.TinyLetter | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr"}, {"userName": "Lisa *OwlBeSatReading*", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4695379-lisa-owlbesatreading", "userReview": "\"I don\u2019t want to talk any more about today. I just want to overeat and shit myself and die. Or shit myself after I die. Apparently that happens. And when you give birth too. Ugh. What a world.\"Although her childhood was haunted by a famous crime, Rhinannon\u2019s life is normal now that her celebrity has dwindled. By day, her job as an editorial assistant is demeaning and unsatisfying. By evening she dutifully listens to her friend\u2019s plans for marriage and babies whilst secretly making a list. A kill list.From the man on the Lidl checkout who always mishandles her apples and squashes her sliced loaf, to the driver who cuts her up on her way to work. And then there's the people who really deserve to die.This story had me roaring with laughter like the mad woman I am. It is 100% my kind of humour, for which I am 100% not sorry for. It's certainly NOT your average humour, and it could very well offend and disturb a lot of people. But not me, I loved it!So, in order to try and lead a relatively normal life, Rhiannon, creates The Act. This is basically her way of fitting in with her colleagues and her group of friends. (aka 'The PICSO's'. You'll have to read it to find out what that stands for. It's absolute class, and everyone has a PICSO or ten in their lives!) They have no idea that she is a psychopath with uncontrollable murderous tendencies.The story is told in diary format, which I love because it's so easy to follow. What I loved about it most of all though was the humour. It was dark, deeply disturbing and very un-pc. Worryingly, I heard my own thoughts countless times throughout!\"Got on the scales first thing \u2013 still not lost the Christmas poundage. Googled \u2018West Country Liposuction\u2019. Can\u2019t afford it. Had an eclair.\" (Yes! Cake IS the answer!)Had I have read this in a public place, I'd of got very strange looks because I was laughing and snorting and nodding my head in agreement all the way through. Rhiannon, you're a gem, albeit a murderous one!!Without giving too much away, here's a couple of tasters of her many Kill Lists which cropped up throughout the story;1. People who walk in groups along the pavement so no one else can get past, like they\u2019re fucking in Reservoir Dogs. (Why do people do this?!)2. Middle-class people who believe it\u2019s their God-given right to bring their babies into restaurants and allow them to squawk all through a meal. (Ugh, don't get me started on this one!)3. Interrupters. (Yep, totally agree!)I know it's a pretty harsh attitude to have, but I'm certain loads of people think these things, the older I've got, the less tolerant I've become, so these felt very relatable for me! Not to the extent that I want to kill anybody though, I'd like to point out!! Rhiannon, you're my kind of girl. But I value my life far too much to be your friend! C J Skuse has created incredibly believable characters with such depth and imagination that every single one of them stood out for one reason or another. Sweetpea was an absolute joy to read. However, it certainly won't be for everyone because there's violence, profanity and stuff that is quite simply, very, very wrong. But, for me, entertainment-wise, it was very, very right. I just hope the author will be writing another instalment, because, damn it, that ended on a cliff-hanger! I need to know what happens to Rhiannon next! This gets a well-earned 5 stars from me, mainly because I can't stop thinking about it and I end up chuckling to myself!Oh, and here's what would be on my Kill List, just for the record;1. Boasters.2. Upstairs neighbours who think it's a grand idea to have laminate floors with insufficient underlay and 3 tap-dancing kids.3. People who lick the wooden stick of an ice lolly. 4. The previous tenant of MY flat, who insists on getting 'payday loans' under MY address with no intention of paying it back. YOU DO NOT LIVE HERE ANY MORE. THEY WILL FIND YOU. AND KILL YOU. Or maybe just insist you pay it back in manageable instalments of \u00a31.21 a month.I'd like to thank the author, C J Skuse, and the publisher, HQ (UK), for the opportunity to read this via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

It certainly isn\u2019t one for the faint hearted lets put it that way.Rhiannon is just the most fabulous character. Each chapter starts off with a list of people and things she hates. It\u2019s like watching an episode of Grumpy Old Men, apart from it\u2019s a young female serial killer. Not sure I should be worried as there were so many things that I agreed with on her daily lists.To be honest it\u2019s not shocking that Rhiannon is slightly damaged. She has been through quite a lot in her life. If anything it has left her quite un attached from things and people. There\u2019s only really Tink her dog that she seems to have any affection for. She\u2019s someone you certainly wouldn\u2019t want to get on the wrong side of that\u2019s for sure!Sweetpea is without a doubt a deliciously dark and twisted read that had me well and truly gripped. Everything is very much a matter of fact in Rhiannon\u2019s world. People who do wrong to her or to others in society deserve to die, simple as that. Whilst it may be a dark read it is actually a very humorous one also. Without a doubt Sweetpea is going to be THE much talked about book in 2017.

Simply put she is a killer and that\u2019s not even a spoiler. She loves her pet dog and her Sylvanian family doll house. Her parents are dead, her older sister gone to the US of A. When she\u2019s not at work as an editorial assistant for a local newspaper, she has a number of side activities. Apart from walking her dog (even though it\u2019s questionable as there is some overlap), growing herbs, dreaming of the Honey Cottage in Wales and adding to the Sylvanian family, she could be slapped with quite a hefty criminal record. Rhiannon might not have the heart or empathy, but she is cunning and she doesn\u2019t hurt any innocents (except that one time). Completing the picture of Rhiannon\u2019s life is her BF Craig. BF Craig who is plugging Rhiannon\u2019s workmate, Lana.Rhiannon is just so over the top full of sarcasm, black humor and retorts. I know the girl has an issue and what not, and while it definitely made her distinctive, I feel her \u2018voice\u2019 wasn\u2019t an underlying creepy kind of cool. It was the slightly obnoxious Johnny Bravo type of cool. At times I did wonder whether I was able to take it all in, especially since Sweetpea is delivered in first person and in sort of a diary form which did let the story down for me a bit as they come across a bit comedy stand-up\u2019ish. You know the ones where there is one anecdote after another, instead of a fluid storytelling? I know, this is a journal type format, so I can\u2019t really blame the delivery.There is a lot happening in this book, what with a healthy cast of characters, and Rhiannon\u2019s special brand of free-time-activities. I feel like I should tell you more, but I won\u2019t\u2026 in terms of plot, let\u2019s just say that as she works in the newspaper she has access to information and her kill list is there for a reason. How she deals with each item/person on her lists? For you to find out\u2026 The plot doesn\u2019t feel all over the place. Everything is explained, the timeline flows smoothly and if you\u2019re willing to take it with a pinch of incredulity at times, then have at it. Just beware, if you are highly empathic, you may get an owwie or two along the way, lots of profanity and cussing. As for me? I had to definitely shut a bit of my brain off. Sometimes ignorance truly is bliss.As such, I am absolutely certain that a number of readers may and/or will find this book completely and utterly wrong. There will always be someone who takes a comment in the wrong way. These comments, Rhiannon\u2019s mental monologue, didn\u2019t affect me. It was what got her off that screamed: a) I have found my limit when it comes to psychos and Rhiannon is one step too far gone for me, and b) I was wondering if it was one of those cases where \u2018Here, this is outrageous already, lets add more fuel to the fire\u2019.While I have come across a number of reviews who were praising the book for it\u2019s humor and funny content, I can\u2019t say I, personally, was belly-laughing my way through it. Can\u2019t argue over a sense of humor I guess\u2026 But I did find a common ground with Rhiannon. Her kill lists included quite a number of things I couldn\u2019t help but agree with. For example, a group of people taking up the whole pavement (I have resulted to just barrel my way through, really!), wrongly packed shopping bag by those volunteer people who collect money for various things (I drop a few coins in their bucket, but tell them to get their mitts off my shopping bag), office peeves (lunch time!!! lunch time surrounded by men!!!), etc.Overall\u2026 who would have thought I would find my limit when it comes to psychotic characters? This book was slightly too much even for me at times! Especially the acts involving a character called AJ and the ending. These made me gag bit\u2026 OK, I lie\u2026 They made me gag a lot. Sweetpea, I hereby declare you, The Shock Factor! 3*- I liked it. I liked it because the story flowed well, the plot was legit, there was plenty to keep me occupied plus them kill lists.

Just a normal girl working in a job where she isn't appreciated, has friends that she hates and her boyfriend is cheating on her. Everyone thinks she is a real Sweetpea. However hiding just beneath the surface, Rhiannon is very angry. Angry at rude people and loud noises. For Rhiannon hides a dark secret, she us a serial killer, killing those who dare to annoy her or try to cause her harm and who knows who her next victim will be?This was a fairly unusual bookj for me as I found myself actually feeling sorry for the serial killer. Rhiannon is very funny and some of her observations/ comments had me laughing out loud. She has a very astute way of looking at the world and telling things exactly as they are. At first you think her comments are unfair or unjustified but as you learn more about her life, both past and present, you realise that there are good reasons for her being like she us. As you learn more about her, you start feeling sorry for her and hoping that she will gave a happy ending. It was interests to get inside the mind if a serial killer and find out more about what makes them tick and what motivates them to kill. The book is written in the easy, intimate style of a diary which helps trick the reader into thinking that they are reading a normal persons diary. This helps the murdersceens seem more shocking and violent. Fair warning some of these scenes are quite gruesome with what's happening to the victims being described in vivid detail. Some of the language throughout the book is a bit offensive so if you are easily offended it might be best to avoid. This is quite an easy to read book. The general tone and flow of the book means you are able to read it quite fast. The fact that the main character is quite likeable, despite being a serial killer, means that you want to keep reading to find out what will happen next. I limed the 'kill lists' or summaries at the beginning of each chapter. It made it easier to keep up with everything that's going on. There is quite a lot of tension throughout the book which increases as more murders are committed and the story hurtles towards its conclusion. I was constantly wondering what would happen next and worrying she was going to get caught. The twist towards the end really took me by surprise as I really wasn't expecting it. I think the ending was a very good and appropriate way to end the book, though it wasn't the way I wanted it to end! The blurb describes this book as a cross between Bridget Jonbes and Dexter which is a really good description of it! This is the debut book from this author and I loom forward to reading many from her. Thank you to Anna Baggaley and HQ stories for my copy of this book."}, {"userName": "C.J.

Rhiannon is as mad as a box of frogs. Done \u2013 end of review. ONLY JOKINGAfter becoming a survivor of a high profile tragic event, she became somewhat of a child celebrity. Of course, as she got older her celebrity status wore off and she started to get bored with everyday life. She writes a kill list at the beginning of each journal entry, mostly of people that have irked her somehow that day (understandable). Crazy shit then happens. Lots of very crazy shit. Lots of very explicit crazy shit. This whole story is completely batshit crazy\u2026 and wonderful. I think this is either going to be a book you love, or hate, or are somewhat indifferent to. I love dark humour but it is very rarely done well. This is an instance of it being done well. I listened to a large amount of this as audiobook (I often do the whispersync thing). On three separate occasions I laughed out loud in public and looked like a crazy person. There is no getting away from it. This book is very explicit. There isn\u2019t really too much romance \u2013 it\u2019s just straight up sex. In lots of detail. Normally romance/sex annoys me and just gets in the way of a good story. But the sex in this is very different. It is described factually and wittily and therefore added to the humour. I didn\u2019t really need to emotionally relate to it for it to have its intended effect. Rhiannon is incredibly sarcastic (on everything) and I love her!... well, I also really don\u2019t like her. I\u2019m so torn \u2013 so much internal conflict. I would make a good character in a story. Normally I would add blockquotes throughout my reviews, but I\u2019m not going to go there with this one! I feel there really isn\u2019t anything I could quote that wouldn\u2019t either be a spoiler or wouldn\u2019t give a true feel for the story. Just read it, and you will see why.If you enjoy the TV series Dexter, you will probably like this. Fun fact, I learnt about Dexter when a work colleague once said to me \u201cOh my god, you need to watch Dexter \u2013 he reminds me so much of you!\u201d I was this person\u2019s boss. This tells you what kind of ship I run. I really enjoy being facetious during \u2018very professional, serious discussions\u2019 at work.

Every day in her diary she makes lists of all the people she wants to kill if she had the chance. And with some of them she does.It's full of deliciously dark humour, the diary style makes it easy and fun to read. For an angry murderer she has a great sense of humour and it was interesting to read about firstly a female killer and secondly just the mind of a killer in general. What do they do when they're not out stalking their prey or keeping the old school bully in their dead parents house, tied up and tortured??? Watch Masterchef and walk the dog apparently.And that's another reason for loving the book. She's utterly normal. Or rather she has pretend normal down to an art and who hasn't faked happiness or being nice to people at some point (you know you have!). I love the fact that she researches whether she's a psychopath with Buzzfeed quizzes. I love how no matter what acts she commits herself there's no way she would ever hurt animals or children.

I really love books with a strong female main character and this book did not disappoint. She is hilarious, smart and quite the complex character. I laughed out loud A LOT which, even though I am generally a giggly, silly person, doesn't happen often when I am reading. The fact that this book is ACTUALLY funny is a huge plus. I'd describe the humor as dry and smart. This book is told in the form of diary entries and each chapter (or at least majority if I remember correctly) starts with a list of people she wants to kill on the day. I could actually relate to some of the things that annoyed her so that made the list aspect even more amusing for me. If I'd had the time I would have finished this book in two, maybe three sittings but unfortunately life got in the way. The twists and turns and the way the story progressed were engaging and well done.Up until the last page this book was really entertaining and challenging and I hope someday I'll get to find out how Rhiannon's story continues."}, {"userName": "Lainy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3642368-lainy", "userReview": "Time taken to read - 1 dayPages - 384Publisher - HQSource - Gift from O/HBlurb from Goodreads The last person who called me \u2018Sweetpea\u2019 ended up dead\u2026I haven\u2019t killed anyone for three years and I thought that when it happened again I\u2019d feel bad.

But Rhiannon has bigger issues than bitchy colleagues and a crappy set of stories to write. Rhiannon is a killer, brutal but always in control, well almost always. Every day she has a list of people she could kill, if an opportunity presents itself she takes it all whilst juggling her own problems. A boyfriend who is playing away, work colleagues who either don't value her or can see through her mask, Rhiannon needs to up her game. Especially when some of her \"activities\" have started to make the news themselves.You know from the offset who the killer is, sure it tells you in the blurb. We hear from Rhiannon in first person narrative so we know her thoughts/feelings/insights which some will love some will hate, I enjoyed it. The warnings, if you are easily offended this is not the book for you. Graphic sexual references, crude, dirty ooft she has a mouth on her that would make a sailor blush. Brutal killings, infidelity, sex, violence, unpc humour, she is hilarious at points but it is one of those you laugh and think oh I shouldn't. I will check out more by this author, if bad language, brutal gutter mouth and unpc humour makes you uncomfortable then this isn't the book for you. If you don't mind a book that pushes it, rude, crude, funny, brutal then this one ticks the boxes for you. 4/5 for me this time!"}, {"userName": "Olga Kowalska (WielkiBuk)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5400141-olga-kowalska-wielkibuk", "userReview": "Po \u201eZ\u0142otko\u201d warto si\u0119gn\u0105\u0107, kiedy szukamy lektury lekkiej, krwawej oraz smakowitej w swoim fabularnym pomy\u015ble.

It is like her drug, the fix that she gets off on including her\u00a0self gratification with the dying and dead.\u00a0She can justify\u00a0her reason to\u00a0kill\u00a0 these people as they are\u00a0not the cream of society. The awful thing is, so can I!Told in the form of a diary\u00a0by Rhiannon, it begins each day with a list of people that have jarred her off the day before. The seriousness of her thinking is hilarious, as I found myself laughing at the\u00a0most inappropriate reasons, why someone could be living on borrowed time. She isn't\u00a0a woman\u00a0you really want to upset, in fact she isn't someone you really want to know at all.\u00a0\u00a0Rhiannon, being a true psychopath, liked her own company but knew that she had to fit into society and so she had a boyfriend but as a reader I was in Rhiannon's head, I knew\u00a0the wicked thoughts\u00a0\u00a0that were behind the kind smile she gave him. It was the same at work, where she has to really try to remember to play nice and appear part of the crew at the Newspaper Office.\u00a0 She is\u00a0quite the chameleon, not really standing out but blending into the environment where ever she is.This is a very brutal and violent story that won't sit easy with some readers but the further you read the more the past unfolds and the more you understand.

From the first page, the protagonist is shocking and unlikable in the most refreshing way. At times it felt a little unrealistic - surely psychopaths aren't thinking about murder constantly, even when they're in the bath or eating ice cream, right? RIGHT? (What do I know, though) - I think that's the point of books like this. You have to embrace the awfulness. The freedom of a character who kills everyone they want to meet. Sweetpea provides. Oh, boy does it provide. Warning: Skuse also writes YA, but this is definitely, definitely an adult book.

Really, I'm not kidding. Sweetpea (I know her name but I'll just use her nick instead) listed every annoying people that crossed path with her. I was excited because hey, she's going to start killing right? She got a plan some where right. By 20% of the book, she killed 2 people unplanned minus the one she did years ago (there're probably more but, that's all I know) and she had someone hostage in her late parents' home.Sweetpea hated everyone and I was hoping she just made a bomb and blow them all up. All I got was her being angry all the time. At one point I just want her to end her life. Like slice your wrist or something because shut up, just shut up and do something about it.It's either you do something about it or let go. But, Sweetpea never let go. So, she kept going on and on being angry. I have no sympathy for her even knowing she was bullied in childhood and that was partly the reason she was what she is now.Skuse made it bearable though. I cannot stop reading and wanted more. I wanted someone to die. I'm craving for blood. Because it got me angry the more I read about Sweetpea anger. If Sweetepea became who she is by being bullied, then I became what I am because of her.Sweetpea was those people who you knew and vented to you so, you sat there and listened with a smile because deep down you knew she had a tendency of hurting people. But, once she left, you will forget everything because it doesn't matter who die as long as it's not you.P/s: There'a mentioned about a guy named Paul who went mountain climbing in Malaysia.

This was a uniquely written story of a girl named Rhiannon who is a serial killer that seems to target bad people, such as rapists and pedos, but also has an ongoing diary of people she'd LIKE to kill...sort of a fantasy kill list. The book is dark and all sorts of wrong, but she is actually a very entertaining main character. I'm also sad to say I kind of related to her thoughts on annoying people, obviously not to her extent, but she had a comical view of the world overall.

I loved this book and can see that some might not but if you do decide to read it be prepared for a roller coaster of emotions that might be better dealt with at home and not on public transport.The kill lists that are at the start of every chapter make you realise that some of the people there you can see her reasoning why she would pick them.

This might sound like a new Bridget Jones...until we see Rhiannon getting caught up in a no-strings sexual encounter that does not quite go as we\u2019re expecting. The opening chapter ended in such a way as to make it clear that Rhiannon is no passive female. In fact, she\u2019s a killer...and we\u2019re given a unique and unedited insight into her mind.Scarily, there are moments when you find yourself agreeing with some of her comments. She has a definite streak that is a little appealing, though totally unconventional.Watching Rhiannon go about satisfying her urges was scary stuff. Yet Skuse manages to present her as not wholly unlikeable.There\u2019s no getting away from the fact that there\u2019s a lot of gruesome detail about the killings.

I've got to say there are some truly gruesome scenes, which actually had me cringing as I read them. Other scenes had me laughing and some scenes had me worried!! Why? Well, basically because I agreed with some of her grumbles, I understood her 'kill list', I get peeved off by many of the things that Rhiannon does. Thankfully I'm not up for killing someone! Although I understood her revenge/vigilante killing spree, she upped the anti when she started feeding her addiction with innocent people.

Skuse knows how to write black comedy, and she\u2019ll have you laughing out loud for sure.Told in a series of journal entries, we journey with Rhiannon through her life as she documents the people she\u2019d like to kill, manages to kill a few of them, all the while keeping up \u2018The Act\u2019 of appearing normal. I won\u2019t divulge any more about the plot but I\u2019m quite concerned that I wish Rhiannon was my friend. Wanting a serial killer for a friend is quite worrying but it\u2019d be so worth it, if she was herself that is. Wait, wait, wait, let me clarify that, by herself, I don\u2019t mean the serial killer part, I mean the sarcastic comments, the dry wit and the downright funny sense of humour.Rhiannon is a wonderful character, and okay, she may have a few murderous tendencies but it makes for entertaining reading, and we all have our flaws, anyway, most of the people she kills are bad, so that\u2019s okay right!? I mean, who doesn\u2019t get annoyed when the person in front of you at the checkout has finished paying for their shopping, their bags are packed and they have their change but they still stand chatting to the cashiers for ages, while you\u2019re impatiently waiting, and then to top it off the cashier has the cheek to thank you for waiting when she eventually serves you \u2013 like you had a choice in the matter! Don\u2019t fret, Rhiannon doesn\u2019t kill this customer, she\u2019s just list-worthy, she tends to turn her fantasies into realities on the people who commit crimes of a more heinous nature. Yes, I\u2019m shamelessly trying to justify having a serial killer for a friend but read this book and you\u2019ll fully understand why. While this is crime fiction, it can be enjoyed by anyone who enjoys black humour.I highly recommend this book, it\u2019s hilarious, full of profanities, has some explicit scenes, it\u2019s definitely adult reading material, it won\u2019t be for everyone but it was perfect for me; come and see what a day in the life of Rhiannon is like \u2013 just don\u2019t call her \u2018Sweetpea!\u2019*My thanks to the author (C.

However, deep down Rhiannon is a bit of a psychopath who lists down the people on her Kill List everyday in her diary and has a flip that can switch a bit too easily. As Rhiannon's blood-lust grows and her anger deepens, it's only a matter of time before she snaps for good.This book is crass, outrageous and just absolutely batshit crazy and I think anyone who likes You by Caroline Kepnes and/or The Girl in 6E by AR Torre should think about picking this up as it might be up your alley. I did think I was really going to enjoy this book but unfortunately it did end up a being a bit of a dud. I'm not actually sure what it was that didn't connect with me - whether it was that my mood wasn't right which made me feel a disconnect with the character or whether i had read similar before and done better. I think what threw me off at first was just how angry Rhiannon was from the get go. She was so full of rage at everything and I felt like she was shouting at me from the pages, which I really didn't like. I started this after a long day of work and maybe my body and mind was just too exhausted to be able to handle a crazy character shouting her Kill List at me. I also just didn't understand how Rhiannon didn't get caught with the numerous murders she commits throughout the book - she gets messier and messier and while the slight twist at the end was good and made me go \"wow\", I do feel like the story was a bit unbelievable and scoff-worthy at times.There was a twisty humour to this book though that definitely earned a chuckled from me a few times. Her Kill List is often full of all sorts of people that everyone encounters at some point during the week or another and people whom everyone has vented about. This book is great for anyone wanting a bit of a shocking read and something that will keep them on their toes.
