Some power there is that draws men's eyes and hearts up and outwards, beyond the heavy clay that fastens them to earth. Music can take them, and the moon's light, and, I suppose, love, though I had not known it then, except in worship.\"There has been nothing more comforting to me than to sit curled up with Mary Stewart's Arthurian series these past several weeks. This holds true for this divine last installment of the trilogy as well. Reading this felt as if I was having my own little heart-to-heart by the fireside with Merlin himself. Merlin, as he is so deftly drawn by Ms. Stewart, has quickly become one of my favorite literary characters. Not a crazed wizard lurking in the shadows with his potions and wacky prophecies, Merlin is instead a very compassionate, charismatic, intelligent, worldly and very mortal human being. His love and devotion to King Arthur is steadfast and akin to that of a father for his son; this feeling is justly returned by Arthur. In The Last Enchantment, Merlin must come to terms with a shift in his power and have faith in the will of his gods. Loss speaks to him in a manner that parallels what he understands to be the retreat of those gods. Yet, there is a purpose and meaning to all things, and Merlin never fails to point this out to me as a reader, not by preaching but simply by showing.Now, veering away from my sentiments regarding Merlin, I must point out that this book has plenty of intrigue for those that prefer a dose of drama and adventure as well. A deliciously wicked villainess in the form of Arthur's half-sister, Morgause, seeks her revenge on Merlin and demonstrates her own knowledge of not just the black arts but the wiles of a seductive woman. Merlin must reach beyond his limited experience with those of the feminine sex to battle such deviltry. \"It is easier to call the storm from the empty sky, than to manipulate the heart of a man; and soon, if my bones did not lie to me, I should be needing all the power I could muster, to pit against a woman; and this is harder to do than anything concerning men, as air is harder to see than a mountain.\" We are also introduced to the beautiful Queen Guinevere who is worshipped not just by her King but by all her subjects within the kingdom. We see the building of the famed Camelot, deception, kidnapping, forbidden love, and true, unadulterated love. It's difficult to express the joy I feel when reading what has become a treasured book series. I am actually not one to read a series \u2013 I have so many books on my list that I don't always get around to reading those that might follow a book that I enjoyed. But this Arthurian series has been an exception rather than a rule. They are so beautifully written that I can't help but savor each one and let myself disappear in this world for a short while. This is a true escape which I highly recommend if you ever feel bogged down by reality and sameness. \"Magic is the door through which mortal man may sometimes step, to find the gates in the hollow hills, and let himself through into the halls of that other world.\""}, {"userName": "Sotiris Karaiskos", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18940246-sotiris-karaiskos", "userReview": "The third book of the series, essentially the book that closes Merlin's trilogy. In this we generally follow the well-known story, although because of the nature of the series so far we are following the events mainly from a distance, with the exception of some very important moments where the magician of our story is directly involved. On the one hand, of course, that does not mean very good things, since essentially very important pieces of King Arthur's story that have even some historical background are left out. On the other hand, however, the things that remain allow us to infiltrate still more to Merlin's character as the writer puts us deep into his psychology, showing us what his own desires are and the way he perceives all power games played. Perhaps in the end this is the main purpose of this series, to show us the perspective of a man who is part of this story but at the same time he keeps the necessary distance to see things more cool. In any case, there may not be the usual narrative in this series but certainly there is enough interest. Of course one book still remains, the one with the final battle, so there may be compensation for those seeking a more common approach.\u00a0So this book may not be something realy great, but it's definitely worth out appreciation. Especially when we reach the most critical points this value becomes greater as the writer delivers them in a very beautiful way that excites and moves. In contrast, with the two previous I found less points of it indifferent. That's why I think it's definitely the best book in the series so far and definitely the perfect finish for Merlin's story. Beyond that I expect to go to the next book and the big finale to make the final conclusions.\u03a4\u03c1\u03af\u03c4\u03bf \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2

and the last of the trilogy that centers around the character of Merlin. In her inimitable way, Stewart gives us the final days of Merlin and brings us full circle to the beginning of The Crystal Cave, in which we are introduced to an old man setting out to tell his tale of wonder in service to his god.Arthur, now King of all Britain, must deal with all the obstacles to his reign that have become so much a part of the legend of his life. Evil, in the person of Morgause, his sister and the mother of his only child, rears its head and bites into the fabric of his glory, and Merlin must help him to steer a course through the dangers she presents. Guinevere comes into his life and with her the seeds of a love for his best friend that is forbidden but impossible to ignore. Merlin experiences love and possible betrayal, and the hardest of all things, the waning of his power. The strength of this series for me has always been the perception of Merlin as a man and not a wizard, a tool of the gods but never a god himself. Stewart carries that theme right to the end in a way that makes you ache for Merlin and share his accomplishments and sorrows in a way that would be impossible if he were all-knowing or in control. The love he inspires in and feels for Arthur is palpable and his failure to understand women and their needs is evident as he deals with the female characters who become so important in his final days. \u201cI said to the ghosts, to the voices, to the empty moonlight: \u2018It was time. Let me go in peace.\u2019 Then, commending myself and my spirit to God who all these years had held me in his hand, I composed myself for sleep. This was the last thing that I know to be truth, and not a dream in darkness.\u201d This is not the end of Merlin\u2019s tale, but which of us would not be satisfied to be able to lay our lives down with so little fear and such faith?I love this series so much and feel so much still when reading them, that I always feel the desire to be able to convey that feeling in some way and inspire others to pick them up and read. There is much of fantasy, history, and legend here, but there is more. There is love, betrayal, purpose, faith and the idea that a life that is lived for something other than self-service is a life worth living and full of reward. There is a sense that if you set yourself in the path of the gods they will guide you toward your true destiny, but that no man can ever go there by himself and without their help. There is the assurance that the encounters we have in life are worth having, even if in the end we must kiss them and let them go. And, perhaps that even in the lives that are touched with great doings and important events, it is the simple things, like the love of a man for his son, that are truly important.\u201cI lifted my head, remembering, once more, the child who had listened nightly for the music of the spheres, but had never heard it. Now here it was, all around me, a sweet, disembodied music, as if the hill itself was a harp to the high air.\u201d The music is there, all around us, and if we listen long enough we will hear it and it will be enough to satisfy us at last."}, {"userName": "Marci", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46028-marci", "userReview": "I've been reading this King Arthur series over and over since I was a teenager.

It was so hard. I think that it ended up ending in a weird place and after going forward and reading \u201cThe Wicked Day\u201d I really wish that Stewart had ended this book better to just stay away from continuing the Arthurian saga.There is really not much to say that I haven\u2019t said in the other books. I like Merlin as a narrator, but everyone else is given very little development. The book starts to feel repetitive after a while. The only new thing in this one is that Stewart throws Merlin a curve ball by having him fall in love. Now this character, Nimue ends up being very important to the story, and I do applaud Stewart for having her be a heck of a lot wiser and even stronger than Merlin. But other than that, it\u2019s same old same old. Merlin rides around a lot looking out for Arthur while Arthur is elsewhere doing kingly things. I am being facetious but honestly I was so bored while reading this book. There is very little action.I was ultimately bored while reading this unfortunately. I think because Stewart didn\u2019t really show me anything new here. We know that Morgause is evil (I say that while twirling my invisible mustache) but I honestly felt more bored by her than anything. I think it\u2019s because Stewart does a lot of telling to the readers about what Morgause is up to so you feel like you are hearing this story from a random guy who tries to chat you up at the bar. You just smile politely hoping he moves on soon so you can go back to drinking your wine/beer/shot.Since I am really familiar with the legend of King Arthur, his queen, Guinevere, Lancelot, Camelot, etc. I didn\u2019t see anything new under the sun here. I think this book paints Arthur more naive than anything rather than some paragon of virtue.The last part of the book is seriously Merlin just being told everything while he was \u201cabsent\u201d from the story. I think it could have been interesting showing how Merlin\u2019s ability to communicate with the gods was waning and how that left him feeling adrift. Instead this whole book was really about himI think the ending was abrupt and was lacking some oomph that for all it\u2019s faults that I had with \u201cThe Hollow Hills\u201d at least delivered on by having Arthur crowned king. Maybe Stewart should have just ended the book with the end of Camelot instead of trying to stretch that out into a fourth book."}, {"userName": "Nikki ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nikki", "userReview": "The Last Enchantment really suffers the most from the fact that it\u2019s written from the point of view of a supporting character. Merlin\u2019s an epic, iconic figure, but he\u2019s not Arthur \u2014 and this version emphasises this even more, with Arthur\u2019s seemingly endless heroism, patience, temperance and sensitivity. I love the Arthurian story too, but it feels like Stewart shielded almost all the characters from harm \u2014 even, in this case, some of the female characters, despite the misogynistic to ambiguous treatment in the rest of the series. She has surprising sympathy for Guinevere, particularly, considering she had no mercy for Morgause.Stewart weaves in an astonishing number of the disparate stories \u2014 the two Guineveres, Nimue/Niniane/Vivien, Melwas, etc \u2014 but, almost because of that, it lacks richness to me. It feels like everything-and-the-kitchen-sink, especially with the way she shields her characters from the consequences; we\u2019ve got Nimue and Merlin in a love story, and Nimue does indeed bury Merlin alive, and yet she didn\u2019t mean to. And Merlin is buried alive and \u2018dies\u2019 there, but\u2026 he doesn\u2019t die.The writing is still good, and it was entertaining enough, but\u2026 this series falls short of excellence.Originally posted here."}, {"userName": "John Porter", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/572656-john-porter", "userReview": "And now a happy story.I read the original Merlin trilogy pretty much when it came out...I was 10 when I read The Crystal Cave and The Hollow Hills, and had to wait until I was 16 before Mary Stewart put out this book, the final book of the (then) trilogy. And what I remember was being disappointed in The Last Enchantment. It seemed like an afterthought, and a muddled one at that.So, okay, fast forward--I couldn't sleep a couple of nights ago, and I wolfed down The Crystal Cave and The Hollow Hills in one massive, insomnia-fueled gulp. I was absolutely thrilled to find out that, unlike a lot of books, they were still as good as I had remembered...better in many ways. But the real surprise was this book, which I saved for today. It is different from the first two books in the series; it's a more adult book. And I can see now what I couldn't see at 16; that the narrative voice ages with the narrator throughout the series. In this, his final book, the narrator (Merlin, for those that don't know) slips into old age and gives up his story--and, in a sense, his life--with the calm and depth of a man who has lived a good life...and knows it. A terrific book."}, {"userName": "Cara", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2735124-cara", "userReview": "I have to disagree with Landon's review of this novel, as I think it misses the point. This is not a series that's particularly interested in the great doings of Arthur and his knights. It is interested in depicting the way people relate to each other within a framework set by prophecy. The first three stories in this series are told from Merlin's perspective. Although Merlin cares about the outcome of the battles, his powers let him know that they will turn out alright. He's also not worried about Arthur surviving them because he knows that Arthur won't die from those battles. The danger to Arthur resides in the child Arthur fathered with his then-unknown half-sister, Morgause. Thus, Merlin's chief concern in this book is to find out everything he can about the child's fate, and to protect Arthur as best he can.This book is not Arthur-centric in the sense that the narrator follows all of Arthur's achievements. It is Arthur-centric in the sense that everything Merlin does is prompted by his desire to protect Arthur and aid him. And for me, the greatest beauty of this series is the Merlin-Arthur relationship; the love and respect they feel for each other. There is no question that Arthur is the central figure in Merlin's life, but I believe that Merlin is the central figure in Arthur's, too. Arthur knows that Merlin is the one person upon whom he can absolutely rely, the one person who will never betray him. It makes Merlin's end more poignant, because we understand what Arthur is losing."}, {"userName": "Benjamin Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4209082-benjamin-thomas", "userReview": "This third book of Mary Stewart's \"Merlin Trilogy\", The Last Enchantment has proven to be my favorite of the set. I tend to judge the books I read by the style of book it is and how well it meets my expectations for the genre. For example, a really good adventure/thriller novel makes me want to keep reading faster and faster to get to the, hopefully, satisfying conclusion. A good mystery may make me read a bit slower to make sure I'm not missing some vital clue along the way. The Last Enchantment was one of those fantasy novels that made me want to really take my time, just to savor the story itself, relishing not only in the classic Arthurian mythos that I love but also in the writing style of Mary Stewart. And I did take my time, nearly a whole week for just one novel!I enjoyed the first two books in this trilogy quite a bit but this one was one notch better still. Both of the preceding novels were fine on their own but, I think, served largely to set the stage for this third volume. We start with Arthur just having been proclaimed King after Uther's death, and get to watch him through Merlin's eyes as he grows into his role. All of the pageantry of the Arthurian legends comes to the fold here but not always as we are used to seeing it. The author's note at the end explains how she used many historical texts as well as the original Arthurian works by Mallory (Morte d'Arthur) to keep to the more authentic legend. Merlin, of course, takes center stage in these novels, telling the story from his first person POV. Ms Stewart does a masterful job of keeping him honest, showing his foibles along with his genius. Not much in the way of description of battles is to be found here; Arthur is often away leading one battle or another but that is all done off stage. Rather the book concentrates more on the relationships of those around Merlin himself such as Nimue, his student/lover/wife and ultimate successor. Other prominent characters such as Morgan, Morgause, Lot, Bedwyn and a host of allied kings and queens all make their appearance.This trilogy is among the best fantasy I've read and will take an honored place on my shelves."}, {"userName": "Joyce", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1650596-joyce", "userReview": "So much for this binge; now I'll have to settle down and catch up on required reading.

It covers numerous events in the Arthurian saga from \"outside\" Merlin eyes- which is often for/from great distances and context misty. And also it follows Merlin's teaching and mentoring the next \"seer\" and enchantress. It was enthralling in parts and also an extremely, for me it was, a difficult read. Because there is so much travel and with Camelot, the building of that core placement along with Merlin's Applegate- so much detail. And also at several levels dozens of moving under characters and always colored within natural and poetic language embedding. It also covers the outcomes and the progressions of Morgan, Morgause, Mordred and the love affair of Arthur's own Queen. This is a decade or more of historic battles and defense/ uniting of Britain as a unit too against the Saxon invasions. Cador's death and all of the Cornwall faction particulars also within this period nearing the ending of Merlin's \"after arising again\" period.For some reason, I grasped Merlin as a mind and spirit of power use far more in his youth. Lots of the other events that were of such core importance to a central British identity were lost more in this book than in the first two in the series. As Merlin relinquishes more and more of his control and power hierarchies and abilities \"owned\"- I just feel he is less and less Merlin. The aging in the way he does it, for me it seems sad.

While I found myself enjoying it more than The Hollow Hills, it suffered from the same flaws I found in that book \u2013 namely, the second-hand nature of much of the narrative. Nearly everything is related to Merlin by a third party with the exception of Melwas\u2019 abduction of Guinevere and Merlin\u2019s tutelage of Nimu\u00eb, whom he believes is a boy in the beginning. Yet even in the latter episode, Merlin spends much of the time in a dreamlike trance, then falls into a coma and is buried alive in his hermitage at Bryn Myrddin; and, in the former, he\u2019s the rower who takes Bedwyr to where Guinevere is held, he doesn't do anything.I can\u2019t blame Stewart entirely for this. In the Arthurian romances and in many modern interpretations, Merlin is not the focus (if he\u2019s incorporated into the tale at all). Traditionally, he\u2019s the power behind the throne, the advisor to the crown, the uneasily tolerated enchanter of an ostensibly Christian king, and it\u2019s hard to make him the center of any tale. Thus, in this series, most of the great tales of Arthur\u2019s court are narrated after-the-fact by couriers and visitors to wherever Merlin is: The 12 battles that secure Arthur\u2019s kingdom, the massacre of the innocents when Mordred is born, Guinevere and Bedwyr\u2019s adultery, Accolon and Morgan\u2019s plot to murder the king, etc.Reflecting on my comments in my review of The Hollow Hills, I had decided I was unfair in criticizing Stewart for her depiction of women. It was told from the POV of a man of 6th century AD Britain, a period not noted as a highpoint in feminine empowerment. The author was reflecting the reality of the times \u2013 women were seen as irrelevant except in their capacity to breed boys. Yet I was again astonished at the level of misogyny in The Last Enchantment, and I\u2019m leaning back toward my original assessment. All of Arthur\u2019s serious problems stem from the machinations of women \u2013 or they do in Merlin\u2019s eyes \u2013 primarily his sisters, Morgause and Morgan, both of whom are \"corrupted\" by their flirtations with witchcraft (a suspect manifestation of the Power that acts legitimately through Merlin). Alternatively, women are silly creatures who let themselves be swayed by emotions (like compassion or fear), e.g., Guinevere. And then there\u2019s Nimu\u00eb. In The Hollow Hills review, I suggested that Merlin is a supremely unreliable narrator, and I raise it again based on the wizard\u2019s account of his affair with the Lady of the Lake. It\u2019s too fairy-tale like and sentimental to ring true, and one can only wonder how delusional Merlin is when he so calmly accepts Nimu\u00eb\u2019s explanation of his interment:She lifted her head. Her face was tragic. \"Yes, and how you gave it! I only pray that you cannot remember! You had told me to learn all that you had to tell me. You had said that I must build on every detail of your life; that after your death I must be Merlin.... And you were leaving me, slipping from me in sleep ... I had to do it, hadn\u2019t I? Force the last of your power from you, even though with it I took the last of your strength? I did it by every means I knew \u2013 cajoled, stormed, threatened, gave you cordials and brought you back to answer me again and again \u2013 when what I should have done, had you been any other man, was to let you sleep, and go in peace. And because you were Merlin, and no other man, you roused yourself in pain and answered me, and gave me all you had. So minute by minute I weakened you, when it seems to me now that I might have saved you.\" She slid her hands up to my breast, and lifted swimming grey eyes. \"Will you tell me something truthfully? Swear by the god?\"\"What is it?\"\"Do you remember it, when I hung about you and tormented you to your death, like a spider sucking the life from a honey-bee?\"I put my hands up to cover hers. I looked straight into the beautiful eyes, and lied. \"My darling girl, I remember nothing of that time but words of love, and God taking me peacefully into his hand. I will swear it if you like.\"Relief swept into her face. But still she shook her head, refusing to be comforted. \"But then, even all the power and knowledge you gave me could not show me that we had buried you living, and send me back to get you out. Merlin, I should have known, I should have known! I dreamed again and again, but the dreams were full of confusion. I went back once to Bryn Myrddin, did you know? I went to the cave, but the door was blocked still, and I called and called, but there was no sound \u2013\"\"Hush, hush.\" She was shivering. I pulled her closer, and bent my head and kissed her hair. \"It\u2019s over. I am here. When you came back for me, I must have been drugged asleep. Nimu\u00eb, what happened was the will of the god. If he had wanted to save me from the tomb, he would have spoken to you. Now, he has brought me back in his own time, and for that, he saved me from being put quick into the ground, or given to the flames. You must accept it all, and thank him, as I do.\" (pp. 490-92)Contrary to what one might think given all these negative things I\u2019ve had to say about the series, it is reasonably engaging, and Stewart is a fine writer. My disappointment arises because I think she could have pushed the envelop a bit more in developing more interesting characters or letting Merlin be more engaged in the events he narrates.It\u2019s on now to the final book \u2013 The Wicked Day \u2013 which is told from Mordred\u2019s point of view, and I\u2019ve always been sympathetic to him (e.g., \u201cChichevache\u201d)."}, {"userName": "Landon", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2820845-landon", "userReview": "The third installment of the Arthurian Saga tracks the beginning of Arthur\u2019s reign as king and the ending years of Merlin. The pace is quite different than the first two, and the story is sort of away from most of the action going on in Britain. This is due to the fact that Merlin is our main character, and it is told from his perspective, and Arthur is the one going off and making things happen, and while Arthur tells Merlin what is going on when he comes back, we are no longer there first hand like we have been for a few of the battles throughout Merlin\u2019s lifetime. To be quite honest, this makes for the weakest installment of the series.Book III: The End of an EraThe tale told within The Last Enchantment is sort of the one that nobody likes to hear, but the reader has to read the book because they simply want to know how the story ends. Stewart is very realistic with the declining of Merlin with age with the fading sense of magic and will to fight. It is sort of like the pro athlete who won\u2019t let the game go. Nobody likes to see their childhood hero take the field and just absolutely shatter his near god-like image in your mind with his talent completely absent in his performance.The main problem is that Stewart doesn\u2019t even try to hide the decline in our protagonist. It is clear that the main plot and storyline seems to go with Arthur if we are interested in the happenings around Britain. Instead, we get to see the near magic-less enchanter Merlin, traveling instead of prophesying, advising instead of seeing.However, since this book follows right after the previous, a little catch-up may be required. Uther took the throne from his brother Ambrosius after his death, and shortly thereafter he conceived Arthur with the Duke of Cornwall\u2019s wife, Ygraine. Arthur is then shipped away to be raised without any knowledge of his heritage. Years later, when Uther\u2019s health begins to fail him, Arthur is summoned to the King\u2019s court at the battlefield against the Saxons. Before the King could tell Arthur who he really was, Arthur helps lead the troops to victory, earning the respect of his fellow soldiers in the process. Uther then names Arthur his heir, before dying at the feast.Characters: Same Old ProblemsIf you have read my previous reviews on this series, then you know that I have an issue with Stewart\u2019s lack of respect to her characters, excluding Merlin. It is quite irritating to develop an admiration towards a character, or even just a liking, to have their end in the book explained in a single simple sentence. Important characters in the past books without a respectful ending include Ambrosius, Ninaine, Golorios, Galapas, and Cador. It wouldn\u2019t be a problem if it was just one.So here we are in the third book of the Arthurian Saga (and final book of the Merlin Trilogy) and Stewart is back to her same character ways. Stewart does a wonderful job of introducing new characters, such as Lot, the king of North Eastern Britain whose loyalty in question. Morgause, Arthur\u2019s sister who tricks Arthur into incest in order to conceive a child with him for her claim to the throne. We are also introduced to Nimue, Merlin\u2019s late life love. The problem is that after the introduction to these people, we are either given a lack of detail or upkeep, or they meet their doom soon after, without any sort of needed conclusion. It clearly shows a flaw in Stewart\u2019s writing style, and therefore a gapping hole in the plot.Plot: A Dreadful EndingSo we are whisked away with Merlin, who has seen Arthur raised to the throne, and therefore, fulfilling his own prophecy. So instead of keeping the reader next to the man of power, Merlin decides it\u2019s a good chance to travel to keep an eye of Morgause. How is this relevant? Or, one step further, how is this even interesting? Yes, Morgause is an evil, sorceress wannabe, but Merlin\u2019s part in even doing anything if she tried to do something interesting? Well it\u2019s a good thing I guess that\u2026 nothing happens. Merlin, whose magic has left him, instead just goes and watches over Arthur\u2019s sister, and does nothing interesting, nor productive.This is by far the least interesting plot in the series. Yes, there are a few twists that come in at the end, but those are not anywhere near what is needed to make the concluding times of Merlin\u2019s life at all interesting. Stewart takes unformulated ideas that could be made interesting, and makes them boring and bland, all the while ruining the characters that she has built up in over 1000 pages of prose. Recommended For:I have to admit, that I do not recommend this book to anyone, even if you are dying to know the last days of Merlin\u2019s life. To be completely honest, it would be better if the reader was left to wonder Merlin\u2019s part in the reigning time of Arthur, or even if the reader was to look to other stories (as there are many) to find out what happens. The interesting parts of the plots are to see the conception of Arthur and his ability to get on the throne, but all from Merlin\u2019s prospective. This loses its glamour once Merlin is out of the limelight, as there is even a part of this book where not even the general public fears the legend of Merlin, which is the single most interesting part of the 2nd book.Stewart really bombed in her attempt to conclude the life of Merlin, just as she bombed the conclusion of about every character in the series. There is not enough carry over between novels, as it is in the end when those things are most important. If nobody is around from the beginning, it makes the ending nearly meaningless."}, {"userName": "Bish Denham", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5802258-bish-denham", "userReview": "I know I read this trilogy when it first came out, but that was long, long ago in a place far, far away. I had forgotten I loved Mary Stewart's writing. Reading the third book as a stand-alone was easy. I didn't need to know Merlin and Arthur's history to enjoy this book of the last years of Merlin's life as told from his POV. I loved the detail, which to some might be too much, but to me was beautiful. Every sentence it seems, is packed with nuance of color, sound, smell, sight, feeling, giving me a deep sense of place and time. The story moves at a pace that fits the times. People moved and traveled about on foot or by horse or by wagon and though it may seem slow, I was pulled along as if floating on a languid tide. I felt like I was Merlin, observing and experiencing everything through his eyes.Lovely."}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16639247-lori", "userReview": "It would seem that Mary Stewart practiced her own subtle alchemy while writing The Last Enchantment.

Even though my life has been crazy busy and I haven't been able to read my book a day as in times past (gods, have I ever taken this long to finish a book series?), every time I sat to read this, I fell effortlessly into where I left off. This last sitting of 75 pages or so hit me as hard as anything, and I'm still tearing up at what I know comes next. Who says you can't go home again?

This trilogy is one of the most popular versions and I enjoyed it, but with some reservations. I liked getting the story from Merlin\u2019s point of view. One of the most exciting things about these books is the way that magic and the mundane coexist. Merlin does possess real magic, but he\u2019s also a skilled engineer, able to achieve architectural feats that appear magical but are really just good science. He sees the future while remaining deeply human, flawed, and conflicted. However, if you want to read these books without becoming annoyed you\u2019ll need to set aside any feminist leanings. This is a book about men, about a man\u2019s world, and women are not portrayed as much other than vessels, props, ornaments, or evil witches. You have to give Mary Stewart a break on this front because she\u2019s writing about an era in which women were not given much value apart from their ability to bear children or male heirs for their royal husbands. But still...I would have liked a slightly more sympathetic portrayal. Generally we don\u2019t hear about the women or their experiences at all. Ygraine (Arthur\u2019s mother) is about the most complex female character you\u2019ll encounter and the best that Merlin has to say about her is that she is almost like a man in being able to set aside her emotions for the greater good. Guenevere is only mentioned in passing and we see nothing of her character. The only other female characters with influential roles are Arthur\u2019s sisters Morgause and Morgan. Both are cast as evil witches. Morgause in particular is seen as a witch but with power that is not remotely as valuable or noble as Merlin\u2019s. She is said to have weak, corrupt, sexual, womanly, witch-like powers and her role is unwaveringly evil. Morgan is even less noble, a minor witch who ends up lusting for power while still managing to appear weak and pliable. In the third book of this series we finally get a female character that contains a hint of dignity. Ninian/Nimue, Merlin\u2019s apprentice, disguises herself as a boy in order to learn from Merlin. Merlin would never have considered educating a girl. Merlin eventually falls in love with Nimue, she earns his respect, and becomes equally powerful in her time. In NImue there is a character that women might admire, but her role is relatively minor, only appearing in the last half of the last of three books. Arthur himself actually gets a bit lost in this telling. I found that by the end I didn\u2019t really know him. This is truly a series about Merlin and it is only his character that comes off as multi-faceted.All this said, I read all 900 pages of these books with enjoyment. The trilogy has a sparkle of ancient history, mythology, magic, and the power of ancient gods. There is much here to engage the imagination. Just read The Mists of Avalon by Marion Zimmer Bradley afterwards so you can get the women\u2019s side of the story!One additional note: one of the reasons that this series is so male focused is because Stewart works hard to stay true to the most historically and traditionally accurate versions of this legend. I admire her care in laying out the story in ways that get at the legend's origins."}, {"userName": "Crystal", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4102616-crystal", "userReview": "I love this trilogy. I knew a lot about the Arthur myths before reading, and I liked that she tried to get as close to the truth of the myth as possible, even by excluding some characters that we know had been invented later for the sake of adapting the Arthur myth to that current audiences' taste. I loved Merlin's character, and that he was not all powerful, or all knowing, but vulnerable and human. I loved the ending she gave to Merlin, I'm so happy she didn't give him a shameful end, by being deceived by Niniue, and that he gets a small taste of love and human companionship that he had to give up all his life for the sake of his power. The only character I was slightly disappointed in was Arthur, and only in this novel. I liked his young depiction, as well as his relationship to Merlin, the disappointment was that he was just a little too perfect. What really brought this home to me was how she handled the revelation of the affair of Bedwyr and Guienevere. He just accepted it too casually, without pain or judgement. I thought it was great how she set up him being absent a lot, and his heart really being in the military and the management of his kingdom, if he had just perhaps felt guilty about this, and out of guilt allowed to affair to continue, instead of it just being that he wanted Guienevere to be happy, or that he loved them both too much, would have added just enough of a human element for me to buy it. This, however, is a small judgement of the novel, and I loved absolutely everything else about the series. From her eloquent and beautiful writing to her effortless unfolding of the plot, I will read this again and again."}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/113545-nancy", "userReview": "I must say, I do like series books where the next book picks up a heartbeat after the last book ended. As The Lsat Enchantment opens, Arthur has just been crowned, and Merlin is deputed to deal with Morgause's incestuous pregnancy with Mordred, Arthur's bastard son/nephew, who will ultimately bring about Arthur's death. The Last Enchantment is perhaps slightly less interesting than the previous two books; all the big events have already happened, and Stewart has less legend to draw on. But there are a couple of terrific parts to this installment: Arthur's marriage to Guenevere, the Arthur/Guenevere/Lancelot triangle (in this version, Arthur's childhood friend Bedwyr fills the Lancelot role, which is good - I couldn't take anyone named \"Lancelot\" seriously - it's just too much like a joke about male genitalia), and the Merlin/Nimue story. Stewart handles all these iconic events with her usual skill; far from being predictable and blunted by their mythical draperies, they seem fresh, resonant and nuanced. I particularly liked how Stewart managed Merlin's \"enchanted death\", the sealing-up alive by the enchantress Nimue from Arthurian legend; as always, she invests it with enough real-life elements to give it plausibility, while retaining enough magic to enthrall the reader.Also, sad to say, the series should have ended here. Stewart wrote one more - The Wicked Day - and she would have done well to have refrained. The central character, and the emotional heart, of this series is Merlin himself; he is barely a cameo in The Wicked Day, and the book suffers proportionately."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7413967-karen", "userReview": "I had a harder time getting through this book than I did the earlier two books on Merlin. Stewart switches gears in this book, and makes it just on Mordred, the bastard son of ARthur and Morgana who was to become Arthur's bane. The book is very good, and the plot is much better than any I've read on Mordred...he isn't a bad man, he doesn't 'plan' Arthur's demise or to betray his father...it's just that fate and mistakes of man have made it so the two men are destined to destroy one another. In some places the book dragged more than the other two books did, and maybe because it was more 'dark' than the first two books due to the subject matter, it was hard to get as involved in. I missed any information on Merlin either...he just disappeared from the entire story, even though he wasn't dead. Again, this history was great in this book. The time period between the collapse of the Roman Empire and the Middle Ages is pretty bare, and this kind of fills in the gaps. There is information about the Celts and those who had taken over in Rome and Byzantine, and their attempts to influence Britain. I enjoyed the book and the story, it just wasn't as good as the first two books in the series..."}, {"userName": "GypsyBookworm", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31298475-gypsybookworm", "userReview": "A terrible ending to a nice beginning. The first book \"The Crystal Cave\" was wonderful and Mary Stewart's characterization of Merlin is masterful. He is an instantly likeable hero and her language is descriptive and beautiful. The way she tells of the plot to arrange Arthur's birth was particularly clever.Then comes \"The Hollow Hills\". Still going strong she further develops the characters of Arthur and Merlin. But then this book falls utterly short. What should have been a great series turns into a mess. The heart of the book disappears. Arthur is not a boring king and fades into the background and Merlin becomes more obsessed with Nimue then guarding Arthur and doing his job. The book meanders on and nothing seems to happen. There is also no real ending becuase Arthur doesn't even die at the end of the book! The story doesn't \"finish\" until the Mordred book which though technically a continuation of this series was written much later and feels tacked on in some ways.)

Even if at times Merlin devoted more time to geography, architecture, and engineering than I care about, it only creates a more believable character for the man who taught Arthur how to be the Once and Future King. True to his role in this portion of the myth, Merlin is removed from most of what\u2019s happening in Camelot. If you know the legends and figures there are hints to the various stories throughout, but they aren\u2019t the focus. It is a solid ending for him which treats him with dignity while staying true to the ending that myth and legends have given him."}, {"userName": "Rachel Marie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26986221-rachel-marie", "userReview": "In the third book of Mary Stuart's Arthurian Saga we go into more detail of King Arthur's struggle with making Britain whole and safe, keeping his enemies at bay, and dealing with the enemies within his own family. Stuart makes the Legend of King Arthur come alive again in her telling of the tale through Merlins eyes. The third book of the Arthurian Saga is enjoyable to read, splendidly written, and an inescapable pleasure. The most climatic book of the saga yet. I found this book so wonderfully written, Stuart gets her saga back on track after the second book slacked in quality.
