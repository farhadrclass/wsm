You see, it\u2019s outrageous and a little out there but this was entertainment at it\u2019s finest and because it was such a crazy ride you truly never really knew what would happen next and those types of reads are always the best for me.This is told from two viewpoints, twin sisters Mallory and Charly and is very fast paced and engaging. Mallory is the twin who grew up with a single mother who struggled to make ends meet and Charly was at the complete opposite end of the spectrum and led a privileged life. Trying to figure out who the Good Twin actually was wound up being more challenging than I had anticipated, gotta love playing the guessing game. The whole long lost sibling premise is nothing new, but what made it different and interesting was that Green has a style that is extremely compulsive. This was reminiscent of watching a juicy soap opera, plenty of backstabbing and betrayals and storylines that are like watching a train wreck, I couldn\u2019t look away!I\u2019ll admit, I did have a few things figured out ahead of time but in the end, Green delivered, I totally did not see the ending coming and was really surprised and pleased by the direction it took. Perfect for fans of lighter style suspense who want a quick read that is sure to entertain.The Good Twin in three words: Dramatic, Fun and Mischievous."}, {"userName": "Sarah Joint", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19758811-sarah-joint", "userReview": "There is very little in this book that is believable. If you will have a problem with that, it's not for you. If you can just accept that it'll be a fun, wild, juicy read before you start, go ahead. As easy to read as it is outlandish, I flew through it in only two sittings. It's like a soap opera, filled with betrayal and more twists than you can count. I did enjoy the read, and if the ending hadn't gone just too off the rails, I would have rated it a little higher. The author definitely took a crazy premise and ran with it. A lot of us have been confused for someone else at some point in our lives. An honest mistake, someone on the street or at a restaurant thinking we're someone else. They usually realize they're mistaken immediately, but that isn't the case for Mallory. The man who thinks she is \"Charly\" is wondering why his wealthy friend is working as a waitress. Some kind of joke? Nope. Just two women that if it weren't for some small differences, could be mirror images of each other. Intrigued, Mallory seeks out her doppelganger... and is stunned by what she sees. So stunned that she runs before she's spotted. This isn't just a passing resemblance. This is two women who have to be sisters. Twins, even. Mallory rents a crappy room and works her butt off to pay for her art lessons. Twin Charly hasn't had to worry about where her next meal is coming from... ever. She's always been rich beyond what most people can imagine. They couldn't have been raised more differently. When Charly's husband Ben finds out about Mallory before she does, he has an idea: Mallory can take her place. With just a few tweaks, they would be completely identical. Ben would be free to spend as much time with his mistress as he wishes, they could get rid of the prenup, and half of her money could be his. Mallory would have more money than she'd know what to do with... if they can pull it off. I received this book from Net Galley and Thomas & Mercer, thank you! My review is honest and unbiased."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53328737-michelle", "userReview": "Mallory is a down on her luck waitress that really wants to be an artist. She was raised by a single mother and they struggled to get by on a daily basis. Charly was adopted by loving, wealthy parents when she was three days old. She owns an art gallery in Manhattan and is happily married to a handsome man and her college sweetheart, Ben. One day while Mallory is at work she is mistaken for someone else. The man insists she is Charly Gordon. He mentions that she owns an art gallery near by. Her curiosity piqued she decides to head to the gallery. She is stunned to see the resemblance. They are completely identical. Rather than introducing herself she runs away in shock. After a few days go by she builds the courage to return to the gallery only to find it closed. A quick search on her cell phone and she finds her feet carrying herself to the front door of Charly & Ben Gordon's home. When Ben answers the door he can't believe his eyes....or his luck...and I'll just leave it at that! This book is going to require your suspension of disbelief. I wasn't completely sold on this one until about 50% in and then things started to get more interesting as the twists start coming at you. Overall, this was a fairly enjoyable psychological thriller. It didn't blow my socks off but I never once wanted to DNF either. A perfectly passable novel to sit back, relax, and enjoy without too much thought involved. 3.5 stars!

I had my expectations on how the story would go but this tale of deception did manage to surprise me at a few points.The first half of this book had me hooked. I had a feeling there was more to the story than what was being presented and was curious to see how those details would surface. The second half of the book took a turn that wasn\u2019t completely unexpected, and the particulars began to fill in. The pace moved along at a fast clip, helped by the short chapters that made it really easy to digest in bite size chunks. Although the plot was interesting, the way the book was structured made it difficult to really connect with the characters. And the ending got a bit convoluted, taking a few random turns before finally coming to a close.Despite my few issues with the latter portion of this book, The Good Twin was still an entertaining ride and I wouldn\u2019t mind picking up other books by Marti Green.

Often I stay away from twin stories, because I feel the whole switcheroo business is a little old. That being said, I was drawn to this book when I read the summary and am glad I had a chance to read it. The writing is taut, the pace fast and the characters intriguing, though not one is likable. There were a few instance in the way the twins behaved which strained my credulity, but I can't really explain that here because I don't want to spoil it. These little issues aside, I enjoyed all the twists and double-crossing and though I guessed at the ending, I was never bored. Some readers might not like unreliable narrators, however I do, and they are done quite well here. I also liked that the story was told in three parts, even if the ending was a little rushed for me.

If you are preparing yourself for a believable tale, don\u2019t. Going into this with the mindset and expectation of an unbelievable yet entertaining story will set you up for a more enjoyable read. The lack of believability was the largest part of my overall displeasure. But, as I said, go into this one with this expectation in mind and you are in for a slow building suspenseful ride!Marti Green has offered a well written and descriptive tale. The story unfolds in a slow buildup and is told from two perspectives. The first half of this book kept me turning the pages. I was hooked on learning more about the characters and figuring out the direction it was going. However, while Part II paints the full picture, I became less impressed. In Part II the story goes back to the beginning, but this time as told by Charly\u2019s perspective instead of her twin Mallory. I found this to be less intriguing and the story lost a bit of momentum for me.While there were some surprising twists, there is also some heavy foreshadowing throughout which inevitably began to give the story away. The ending fell a bit short for me as I would have preferred to see this story pan out differently, but it did result in a well-rounded story. By the way, am I the only one who sees Natalie Portman when looking at this pretty cover? I couldn\u2019t help but imagine Mallory and Charly being represented as Natalie because of this.Despite my quarrels with the second half of this story, it was an entertaining read. I suggest this read to anyone who is a fan of Lifetime-style movies.

Deception, twists, suspense... Always consider me signed up for that! I want to say before I start my review that it is preferable to go into this psychological thriller completely blind and don't pay too much attention to the blurb. Thankfully I didn't remember the details myself when I started reading The Good Twin, but the blurb does give some spoilers that might ruin some of the surprises and twists. Of course I have adapted my own summary to avoid those spoilers. Ok, what that out of the way, it's time to talk about this story. Because boy, it was one heck of a ride... I found myself hooked from the moment I started reading, and this had a lot to do with the writing style. There is just something about the way Marti Green writes that makes me fly through the pages and I literally finished it in less than a day. The Good Twin kind of has that The Kind Worth Killing air, and only in the best possible way. The plot development and the order in which the story is told, from different POVs, are both simply brilliant and only add to the overall suspense. I don't want to give away too much of the plot to avoid spoilers, but there will be twists that will mislead you and you won't be able to get the full picture until the very end. Always a good sign of a successful psychological thriller right? The main characters are very important in this story and have been very well developed, each identical twin with her own background story. They were easy to relate to and it was interesting to see the events unfold and find out how they reacted to it all. In short a highly entertaining, fascinating and well developed little masterpiece of psychological suspense.Mallory Holcolm hasn't had an easy life, growing up with a single mom and not a penny to spare. She has finally made it to New York to chase her dream of becoming an artist, talking art classes when she is not working as a waitress. Then one day she discovers something truly remarkable about her past: she has an identical twin she never even knew existed. Charly has had quite a different life than Mallory, being adopted by very wealthy parents and she never wanted for anything during her childhood. She is married to her college sweetheart Ben, owns a gallery and is the heiress of her father's fortune. Mallory found out about Charly by chance, and it is also by chance she meets her sister's husband Ben first. And what Ben proposes to Mallory might just change both their lives forever...There is no doubt whatsoever that\u00a0The Good Twin has everything I look for in a psychological thriller and more. A well developed plot, interesting characters, just the right amount of suspense and plot twists to keep me guessing... And of course a writing style that is engaging and flows naturally. The premise of\u00a0The Good Twin\u00a0is fantastic, and the execution without doubt lives up to expectations. It's easy to say I can recommend it to any psychological thriller fan.

This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.I honestly don't know where to start with this book, it was a bit of a mess.Try to suspend your disbelief when reading this because this book definitely requires you to.We have a young mother that was thrown out of the house because she was pregnant and refused to give up her baby. At the age of 16 a young girl made a hard choice when she found out that she had twins. She gave up her first born in adoption and kept the second twin to raise by herself. One grew up in a very rich family, the other grew up in poverty.Years later, Mallory is a waitress and stumbles upon a man who confuses her for someone else. Curious, she tracks down the woman he thought she was only to discover, wow, she looks just like her. Too afraid to approach her in person, she decided to visit the woman at her house only to be greeted by her husband and spun a bunch of lies.Now Mallory thinks her sister is heartless and that Charly (the sister) believes that Mallory only wants to meet her because she wants her money, she believes her husband Ben who is spinning these lies.Ben offers Mallory a proposal that if all Mallory does is say yes, her life will be changed forever.I don't even know how to review this without spoiling everything.All the things I found wrong and frustrating1. I could not wrap my head around Mallory and her decision to go along with Ben's plan and still claim that she is such a good person and is deserving of so much more because what she agreed to do wasn't simple as blueberry picking. It's not a decision that a \"good\" person would step into lightly and quiet frankly, her reasoning made me sick as well.2. The end was just a mess piled upon a layer of another mess and turned me beyond angry. I wanted to throttle Mallory, who became the world's BIGGEST freaking hypocrite, trust me guys, it is taking me a lot of self control here not to let out a string of curse words and how much I loathed that ending. I found it unrealistic, I found myself angry at everyone involved and in the end, I honestly just wanted to see them all burn. After everything that went down and how it went down and all the stupid lies and actions these two sisters did not deserve any kind of happiness.The end kept kind of jumping forward in time quickly over and over again and I just could not wrap my head around who the hell did Mallory think she is, making those kind of decisions after what she herself tried to do and blah just no.Overall, it was fast paced. Suspend your disbelief and you might enjoy it. For me?

I happen to have a soft spot for Lifetime movies - guilty pleasure level high! You really have to suspend a LOT of reality in this book. It runs fast, short chapters and is a bit over the top. The biggest reveal/twist was very easy to predict but yet I still found myself clapping my hands when it happened. Then it goes even further, culminating in a too neatly tied bow for my taste.Placed in NYC and even parts in my neighborhood, Astoria, placed perfect visuals in my head. I think this is perfect for those who want that easy read and a book they can fly through. The decisions that are made and the swiftness in which they are made are jaw dropping. Again, the best way for me to describe it is to compare it to a Lifetime movie. Those who read a lot of thrillers will find this easily predictable. I do think it's quite the enjoyable read though.

I like the way it was written, I usually dislike books that have different point-of-views. This clearly was an exemption. My only trouble was I find it hard to find sympathy and to relate to the character, Mallory. And finding sympathy for a character is important to me. I was in the middle yet nothing. Not until like seven chapters before the ending. I feel that there should have been more of the character(s) background story to build it more up.It was not entirely a chore to finish up. It has a not-so really unique plot but it flows on naturally. The writing is good, details in the novel were good. I felt like I was really in the room about the financial meeting quite taxing indeed. The amount of suspense going on was enough. I anticipated through; so that I could have my mind more messed up as it was.

Would you feel a tinge of jealousy? Or would you want something more: would you want revenge?\nMarti Green's\nThe Good Twin\nfollows the character of Mallory, who grew up in poverty after her 17-year-old mother was booted out of her parents' house while pregnant with twins. Her mother keeps Mallory and puts the other twin up for adoption. Sadly, Mallory's father dies in the Gulf War, leaving Mallory and her mother alone and financially destitute. Mallory's mother never tells Mallory about her twin. Mallory experiences yet another tragedy when her mother passes away at a young age, taking the secret of Mallory's twin to the grave.\u00a0Mallory moves to New York to pursue a degree in art. She squeaks\u00a0by working as a waitress and lives in a communal house that barely qualifies as habitable. Despite all of this, Mallory is living her dream of being an artist in New York. But everything changes when Mallory meets an attractive young man, Ben, while waitressing. Ben tells her she looks exactly like his wife, Charly, who runs an upscale art gallery. Mallory finds the art gallery and discovers that she indeed looks like an exact replica of Charly. She soon discovers that Charly is her biological twin that her mother abandoned.Ben convinces Mallory that Charly is a \"bad twin\" of sorts. He claims Charly grew up as a wealthy only child and, as a result, is stuck up and cruel. Ben, who is leading a double life of his own, proposes that he and Mallory take over Charly's fortunes by having Mallory pose as Charly. Mallory, feeling resentful of Charly's posh upbringing, hesitantly agrees to Ben's plot. Little do they know that Charly, too, has a playbook of her own.If you are a fan of books like Catherine McKenzie's\nThe Good Liar\nor Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen's\nThe Wife Between Us,\nyou'll enjoy this book. There are several unreliable narrators in this book and determining who is telling the truth and who is lying is half the fun of this book. This is one of those books that you will easily devour late at night because it's so easy to get invested in the characters from the very first page of the book.

I am all about lies, deception, and plot twists. I definitely got that out of The Good Twin, and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it.As the synopsis says, The Good Twin follows a set of twins who were separated at birth. While Mallory grew up poor, Charly grew up surrounded by wealth and everything she could ever want. But once Charly\u2019s husband, Ben, learns Charly has a twin, he approaches Mallory with a clever proposal that may benefit them both.The Good Twin is a page-turner, and I flew through it. I will admit the writing is a bit basic, though. I don\u2019t mean that in a bad way at all. Just don\u2019t expect the writing to be elaborate or lyrical. Which, for a thriller, is just fine with me. Another thing that stood out to me was that the characters were a bit one-dimensional. From the get-go, Ben is made out to be the villain \u2014 a role he most certainly fits, and quite frankly, I found zero sympathy for him. Mallory is grey area, whom I\u2019m sure will end up being a 50/50 split between whether or not you love or hate her. There were also a few times when a character would give their reasoning for their \u201cbad\u201d decision, and I\u2019d be like, \u201cREALLY!?\u201d So, while that may be a bit unrealistic, you have to remember that some of these people are morally grey, which makes for a great thriller.The schemes, deception, and the different layers to the plot completely make up for the one-dimensional characters. I mean, I genuinely loved how much was unfolding in front of my eyes with each turn of the page. I thought the beginning started out a little shaky, but once things picked up, I was 100% invested. I would definitely pick up another Marti Green book. I think The Good Twin would be perfect for fans of Ruth Ware, Paula Hawkins, and Gillian Flynn.Thank you to Thomas & Mercer for sending me a copy in exchange for my honest review!

I think this book would be perfect for someone who likes to dip into psychological thrillers every now and then. I was a bit predictable for me and I think it may be like this for those who are constantly reading psychological thrillers. You know that there is a \u201cbig twist\u201d from the beginning and, for me, it was bit easy to figure it out. This doesn\u2019t mean that I didn\u2019t enjoy the book though because I did! I liked the way the story was told from different points of view. It really gave insight into what all of the characters were thinking and how they came to make the decisions that they made. I think the other characters besides Mallory could have been a bit more developed. That would have added another positive element to the story. I was intrigued and definitely wanted to keep reading the book. It flowed nicely, which isn\u2019t always the case with stories that have multiple POVs. Overall, it was an enjoyable read. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading a psychological thriller every now and then."}, {"userName": "Authentikate", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19389962-authentikate", "userReview": "3.5 Stars Thank you to Netgalley for giving me this ARC in exchange for an honest review. Full disclosure: I\u2019m a former scientist. Former science instructor too. So, I snap up contemporary genres with a science premise greedily. It\u2019s not always a good thing\u2014finding fault with the science, catching mistakes...that sort of thing. There\u2019s little to worry about here: it\u2019s a straight nature v. nurture concept\u2014are twins alike because of genetics or are they alike because of raising? While this trope has been explored before, I like how The Good Twin unraveled it, rather straight forward...in your face, so-to-speak. Right off the bat, one twin is instantly unlikable. That\u2019s a problem, because she is so instantly unlikable one may find themselves unwilling (or unable) to care. It\u2019s always good to have a clear villain. But, the reader has to care about the characters to engage. The story is written well enough that the reader can engage despite Mallory\u2019s put-off personality. There are appropriate twists and surprises and characters that are superficially interesting (higher stars had they been deeper). I think this is a book people will want to read and will divide opinions. I\u2019m guessing the division will lay on a Mallory fault line."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1179650-cheryl", "userReview": "In regards to a psychological thriller; this book was \"fine\". There were no big shockers or moments that left me with goose bumps. However, this was still an good read. Who knew that \"two minutes\" could make such a difference. What I lacked and craved was some mystery or at least intensity. There wasn't build up to Mallory and Ben's plans. Additionally, when it came to Ben, he was a slimly man, who had whatever was coming to him. As far as Mallory was concerned; I felt a little sorry for her as she was a good person but just caught up in a world that she could only dream of. There was not much know about Charly, other than what Ben spoke of her. So it was hard to tell if she actually deserved what Ben and Mallory were planning against her. When it came to the ending, it was predictable. Overall, though a easy and quick read. I would read another book by this author."}, {"userName": "Heidi Lynn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8843732-heidi-lynn", "userReview": "First, I want to thank Marti Green, Thomas & Mercer and NetGalley for providing me with this book so I may bring you this review. Once again NetGalley has turned me on to an amazing author!! I just got finished reading Good Twin by Marti Green and boy can she tell a story with out of this world twists and turns!! One book I could not put down until I had finished. This book was such a unique yet intriguing storyline that nobody has ever tackled before. This book would be perfect for the big screen that would be a smash hit. Marti Green immediately caught my full undivided attention with this exciting, fast paced, emotional prologue in the Good Twin and was hooked since. Even though the title says Good Twin-I was just as in shock as Sasha a young 17 year old girl she found out she was having a twin girls!! She was giving up I felt the love she had for her two newborns and how desperately she wanted to keep both of them. My heart broke in pieces for her. Even though I\u2019m not a Mom I could not bear to give either of them up. Two identical twins, one that was older was given up for adoption by a wealthy family, the other daughter lived a totally separate poor life. Neither of them knew about eachother until one day out of the blue Mallory\u2019s life changed. With everything that goes on in this book all Mallory wants is a sister and a family! Nothing else mattered to her. My favorite characters in this book were Mallory and Jake. I really loved the friendship they were building. The character I liked least was Charly\u2019s husband Ben. He was a bad egg from day one!! The Epilogue in this book put great closure on the characters with the book. This is one of the few Epilogues that made me smile ear to ear. I highly suggest this book to anyone. Plus, I would read anything by this author again."}, {"userName": "Erika", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4640487-erika", "userReview": "Thank you to the publicist for providing me a with a free copy of the book. This is an honest review \u2013 all opinions expressed are my own.The Good Twin is a quick, suspenseful read that kept me trying to figure out just which twin was supposed to be the good one! The story is told in alternating points of view between Mallory and her newly discovered twin Charly. While you may think each twin is telling you the whole story as you read her chapters, that\u2019s not always entirely true.The premise and the pacing are great. There was very little time wasted with setup at the beginning \u2013 the author just dives right into the heart of the story. I would have given the book a five-star rating except for my feeling towards the twins themselves. Neither one was particularly likable. Sometimes I felt that they acted in a way not keeping with the character of the twin that had been described to me up to that point in the story, and I really couldn\u2019t relate that well to either one. This wasn\u2019t enough to keep me from enjoying the story though, so 4 stars it is."}, {"userName": "Desiree", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5613369-desiree", "userReview": "This was a popcorn mystery/suspense.

But if one cooks up a devious plan, one should not be dumb. Don\u2019t get me wrong. There are a lot of dumb people in reality and they usually get caught by the police pretty quickly, mainly because they fancy themselves really smart. Duh. But Ben was supposed to be this clever, aspiring lawyer, for crying out loud! Those aren\u2019t stupid!Mallory\u2019s behavior changed with the weather, and her halfhearted attempt to convince herself she\u2019s in the right was quite frankly disturbing. Which is good. Disturbing is good. Disturbing is what we what we want in a thriller. But it\u2019s hard to believe a sweet young lady would turn into a ruthless conspirator overnight, at least without a very good reason.The police gets involved at one point, but they are utterly incompetent and conveniently (for our bad guys) forgot how to police. The detective assigned to the case, whom we met first as a model in Mallory\u2019s drawing class, is quite a looker, but considering what he does for a living, he should be more than a brainless buff dude. If you ask me, I would wager it\u2019s probably not a good idea for a police officer to plan dangerous operations based on the opinions of a civilian, who basically just wants to do stuff because they just \u201cwant to see what would happen\u201c.Marti Green can write well, I have no doubt about that. The whole book felt like a movie and had a nice flow to it, which is awesome! But! When it comes to thrillers, I need them to be realistic. I can suspend my disbelief, sure: for unicorns, futuristic societies with body mods, ghosts that help investigations, oppressive governments pitting teenagers against each other for entertainment\u2026 I think you see where I\u2019m going with this.The author, Marti Green, has a degree in both psychology and law, so I\u2019m sure she knows her stuff well. But as a reader, non-psychologist and non-lawyer, I need an actual explanation if I\u2019m expected to accept a certain turn of events that doesn\u2019t ring any realistic bells.A mildly entertaining, light suspense, The Good Twin is and exploration into nature vs. nurture, a story of sibling rivalry gone wrong."}, {"userName": "Nessa", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4919235-nessa", "userReview": "Huge thanks to the publicist and Netgalley for providing me with a free copy of the book to enjoy. This is an honest review. All opinions expressed are my own.3.5 StarsHow far would you go to claim the life you could have had? The Good Twin really digs into the whole \u201cPrincess and the Pauper\u201d storyline, but with a twist. When Mallory discovers that, not only does she have an identical twin sister but, only two minutes made the decision over which twin grew up in poverty and which was given luxury she starts questioning a lot about her life. When she is given the opportunity to change her future and grab on to the life she could have had\u2026well the thought of money and privilege would be enough to seduce anyone. The author really knows how to grab the reader right away and sets such a great pace throughout the book that, before you know it, you\u2019ve read the entire thing. I found the storyline very gripping and I don\u2019t think I had a single second of boredom or page skimming. I was deeply engrossed from the first page\u2026and then we got to the ending. Let\u2019s talk about that, shall we? This entire book was like being given a cone of your favorite ice cream only to have it fall to the ground as soon as you try to take a lick. And it just keeps happening. Over and over again until eventually there\u2019s just no more ice cream and all you\u2019re left with is a soggy cone. Here\u2019s where I have issues; we get a great storyline, an intriguing background and then comes this killer plot\u2026which just falls together so easily? Seriously? Huge, life altering decisions need to be made and\u2026just\u2026sure, why not? I\u2019ve given more thought to lunch. That seems to be the theme I kept seeing through the book. I\u2019d be deeply into the story, then something happens and it\u2019s all just so unbelievably easy. Key word\u2026unbelievably. I felt that there really should have been some type of real conflict somewhere and was let down. Like the characters decided that they didn\u2019t want to play anymore so they were just going to let everything happen. I could have forgiven it all, too, if it wasn\u2019t for that ending. Without getting spoiler-y\u2026.all I\u2019m going to say is people are NOT that way (there is no word I can think of that won\u2019t give something away here). This was not the ending I signed up for and I feel a little bit cheated. That\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say on the matter. The thing is, this is a really good book. It really is. I was completely drawn into every second of the story. I just left it feeling very, very unsatisfied. It shouldn\u2019t be wrong to want your ice cream, and get to eat it too."}, {"userName": "Mona ", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3595335-mona", "userReview": "Thank You, NetGalley, for my complimentary review copy.Mallory and Charlotte Jensen, twin girls born to a young mother, grew up in vastly different circumstances, unaware of each other\u2019s existence. Their mother, Susan AKA Sasha, could not afford to keep both her girls so she kept the first-born, Mallory. \u201cCharly,\u201d now an art gallery owner, had a privileged upbringing and lives an affluent lifestyle with her husband, Ben Gordon. In stark contrast, Mallory, an artist, could not afford to go to college. She lives for the art classes she takes at a local art institute and works as a waitress. Her home is a run-down boarding house. From the very first line, I was drawn into the story. The book is divided into five parts, including a preface and epilogue. In between, the parts shift perspective from Mallory to Charlotte. The writing style is very readable, the chapters short, the characters, well-developed.One fateful day, a customer in the restaurant where Mallory works mistakes her for her twin and mentions the gallery. Out of curiosity, she goes to check it out and there she sees her mirror image. Completely caught off-guard, she leaves without meeting her sister. She visits Charly\u2019s home and the door is answered by Ben, who is just as shocked, but invites her in. Mallory is entranced by her beautiful surroundings, a stark contrast to her own. Ben notices her reaction and a devious, sinister, but brilliant plan takes shape in his mind.At first taken aback by Ben\u2019s proposal, Mallory comes around once Ben tells her about Charly and provokes her about what could have been and what still can be. So, the plan is put into motion. All goes smoothly...until it doesn\u2019t.In conclusion, I loved this book, my first by this author. The blurb intrigued me. There were unexpected plot twists that made the story anything but predictable and kept me reading, eager to find out what will happen next. I loved that I didn\u2019t have a clue. The end was somewhat sappy, but satisfying."}, {"userName": "Darcia Helle", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2439410-darcia-helle", "userReview": "Oh, I so dislike being in this position. I didn't like this book. The short explanation: The story is implausible and the characters' behavior is ridiculous.Now I will do my best to elaborate without spoilers.The story starts out well. We meet Mallory, \"the good twin\", whose part is written in first person. Initially, I found her character compelling and mostly likable. The pace is steady and the plot shrouded in mystery. We have elements of jealousy, greed, loss, and deception that could have made for a powerful story.Then we meet Ben, Charly's husband, whose part is in third person. He is immediately and wholly unlikable. Mallory connects with Ben and, despite the fact that he oozes narcissism and deceit, decides to trust him implicitly without the slightest hesitation, much less the merest hint of disbelief. Next we meet Charly, the other twin, whose part is in first person. Here we begin rehashing all the previous events from her perspective, which slows the pace quite a bit. Despite all the rehashing, I didn't feel her part was as developed. I didn't understand her on the same level as I did with Mallory and Ben. I'd really like to know what Charly and Mallory saw in Ben that made him even remotely appealing. Honestly, he's a whiny, greedy, selfish, arrogant, narcissistic womanizer. Yet Charly delves right into his sociopathic world without first doing the sane thing of fact-checking, and Mallory is married to the jerk. And then events happen that had me shaking my head, sputtering words like, \"Seriously?\" I mean, I know this is fiction, but it's not fantasy. I have to believe it could happen. All that being said, this is a fast read. The writing itself is good. So, if you can suspend belief and go where this story leads the same way Mallory did, without hesitation, then you might enjoy it.*I received an advance ebook copy, via NetGalley, in exchange for my honest review.*"}], "description": "In Marti Green\u2019s twisting novel of psychological suspense, twin sisters become engaged in a dangerous deception\u2026Mallory Holcolm is an unfulfilled waitress and aspiring artist living in a Queens boardinghouse when she learns something astonishing about her past: she has an identical twin sister named Charly she never knew existed.Charly is a Princeton graduate, a respected gallery owner, and an heiress married to her handsome college sweetheart, Ben.
