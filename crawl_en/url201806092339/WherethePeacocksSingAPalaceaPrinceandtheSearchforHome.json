It could have been a 'Eat. Pray. Love.\" had she not been a writer for People. Vapid, trite and shallow - I'm sure Miss Gee is a lovely human, it just didn't come across in her writing. Her incessant reminiscing about the glamour of Hong Kong was dull. I kept hoping to see a maturation of her character - didn't happen. When her fiance shares the story about how he became a vegetarian (actually quite touching) she doesn't appear to grasp the beauty or the depth of the experience which shaped his life choice and (like a good Material Girl) wants to hear more about the palace. This scene repeated itself throughout the book. I found it tiring - maybe you'll see something different."}, {"userName": "Richard Kramer", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8281392-richard-kramer", "userReview": "It took me a while to realize why I was loving this book so much, other than the fact that it is a) delightful, b) hilarious, and c) filled with fascinating insight into what used to be described as Other Lands. I loved this because it reminded me of books I read as a young teenager, not because it is pitched to a young audience (or YA; ghastly marketing term) but because it speaks of an amused, sardonic, adult point of view that seems as if it could only exist between the covers of a book. Had I read this at 13, it would have made me want to write books. Now, at 61, it makes me want to have written this book. Since I can't do that, all I can do is give it my highest recommendation. And a warning -- if you meet Allison's mother-in-law, Mrs. Singh, don't fear her.

Enter Ajay, an Indian journalist for whom Alison gives up her lavish lifestyle. Only after Alison and Ajay are engaged, does Alison learn that he is a prince.Alison\u2019s journey takes her from middle-class Los Angeles where her father has grand dreams, but modest means, to upwardly-mobile Hong Kong, where girlfriends and boyfriends are accessories and last season\u2019s clothes are taboo, to Mokimpur, a haveli in India where Ajay\u2019s royal, but financially-challenged family lives in a 100-room crumbling palace where peacocks sing and daily life is centered around mouth-watering curries, samosas, parathas, and chai.Snapshots from the book include: Alison, in four-inch platform shoes, towering above Ajay\u2019s mother. Cow dung being shaped into patties for fuel. Hundreds of idols bathed in the sink and then wrapped in tiny cashmere shawls, and the faithful servant of four decades sleeping on the garage floor while bedrooms lie empty because reincarnation has determined his caste. This is a beautifully-written story of a girl who finds her prince, a new set of values, and more than one place to call home."}, {"userName": "Melina Watts", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3723008-melina-watts", "userReview": "Still in a dazzle from book signing at Vroman's last week with Alison Singh Gee. The pieces she pulled to read from the book had me so entranced that I HAD to read her book \"Where the Peacocks Sing\" while waiting in line for Mexican food on the way back home. The book is literally enchanting ... Hong Kong, India, Los Angeles, fascinating aka impossible relatives, crazy money, poverty, shimmery prose, true love, mangoes and peacocks...this book has it all.The heroine ... who happens to be the author herself ... undergoes a massive transformation from \"Sex in the City\" cooler than thou designer clad journalist / babe in Hong Kong to ... well read the book to find out. But trust me, you'll like the end game. At the book signing, the author joked that one of her writer friends commented that maybe the book was more of a memoir of her husband than of she herself;I would argue something different: this book is one of those rare romances wherein the back story of the hero and the back story of the heroine are both well served and the collision between their two worlds results in a different better combined reality, a happy ever after so sweet that I found myself forced to stop to buy Indian food on the day after I read the book to get some legitimate chai. Alison is one of those rare writers who writes male characters as well as she writes female characters and the other way around, too. And she does pretty well for writing houses as characters. After such literary candy, I needed some genuine sweet of my own. Chai at night. Bed tea. An Indian noun learned from this truly delicious read.Good for book clubs. Good for late night treat for you. A must as surely as those outrageous shoes Alison used to buy in Hong Kong back in the day..."}, {"userName": "Rachelle", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/447322-rachelle", "userReview": "It's tempting to read this book as quickly as possible to find out what happens to the highly engaging characters. But then you may miss not only the rich ambiance of Hong Kong, India and LA's Chinatown, you may miss the layers of meaning within this tale and the depth of the characters' transformations. Beyond the entrancing love story is another journey, one where the author explores her family's past and her heritage, how notions of worldly success can blind us and what can happen if we challenge our idea of what matters in life. The concept of home and the broken-down palace were beautifully rendered and made me think about what home means to me.I loved being transported between bustling Hong Kong and rural India. But moreso, I loved the narrator's reflections on what was happening within her, to her, as she questioned everything she'd known in her life and took a leap of faith. The sensible and spiritual wisdom from her Indian fianc\u00e9 was inspiring. The epic culture clash between families was something many can relate to and showed that no matter what you do for love, there are still battles ahead. I can't recommend this book enough. It's beautiful."}, {"userName": "Cait", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4577054-cait", "userReview": "I didn't like this book. The cover is gorgeous, and the backcover copy sounded really good. And then I started reading. I don't mean to be rude but it came across that all the narrator does is whine and complain about her life. She's selfish, crap with money for the majority of the book and just really irritating.The other aspect I found hard about this book - which is no fault of the author - is that I struggled with India. How the country functions, the caste system etc. I just didn't understand how it could be that way and everyone was okay with it. So I found myself getting frustrated about certain interactions.Overall, I'm not quite sure what the point of this book was. She has a difficult/crappy childhood, moves to Hong Kong, works, parties, bitches and moans about everything possible, meets love of her life, and then they struggle with money, and she meets the in laws and vacations in India all the way telling me...nothing important. She's not on a journey of self discovery and if she is it's hidden pretty damn well within her bitching and moaning.

Beautiful writing too! I loved this this book the same way I loved Eat, Pray, Love, but probably even more. This book to me had more depth in that you also witnessed the development of a deep love and a relationship to two countries that Allison had spent a lot of time in. Unlike Elizabeth Gilbert, hers wasn't superficial knowledge gleaned from a book or from being just a tourist. I had so many questions about Indian culture and this book answered a lot of those but in a way that had so much grace and humor. I learned a lot about Hong Kong, China too.

Alison Singh Gee led me through her journey of self-discovery, and the search for a deeper existence, with powerful images and unforgettable characters. In her memoir, she recounts her high octane life as an editor of Asiaweek in Hong Kong with humor, especially when she describes her elitist expat British friends. A world that was very foreign to me until I read this book. The best part though, is when she meets Ajay, a handsome and unpretentious Indian journalist and goes with him to his native village in India to meet his family. What began as a charming fairy tale soon turns out to be a crash course in how to deal with a haughty and detached future mother-in law, a broken down hundred-room palace that was once the jewel of Northern India, and the inflexible Indian caste system. A must read for anyone who knows what it means to look for home when life's journey takes you away from what is familiar and safe and propels you into the unknown.

I really would like to give it more than 4 stars but two points keep me from doing so. The first is for all the defined terms in the book. I figure in this multi-cultural interconnected world that either a) you should know what a non-english word means or b) if you don't know what it means you should educate yourself and look it up on the internet. I found these definitions jarring to the flow of the narrative. The second point was that structurally, the book felt like it was missing a chapter. In particular, I thought that the book should have had a more extensive chapter at the end of the book with Alison and Ajay in Los Angeles. I think this would have better mirror/balanced their early time together as documented, mirrored/balanced Alison's early years in LA, and finally more succinctly shown the change/growth in Alison.Overall a great first book."}, {"userName": "Denise Florent", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19455250-denise-florent", "userReview": "This is the first book I am reviewing.

So many things in one book. I also love how she examines the idea of what society wants us to want and what our hearts might actually want and how it is so hard to listen to the voice inside ourselves.

When Alison met Ajay they had very different ideas about life and I wasn't sure this was going to work as a relationship (even knowing she had written the book in current time and was married and had a child) but as you read about their finding their ways in different cultures, I began to see how their differences would come to represent the best parts of each of them as they forged a relationship and marriage. This book begs a sequel. I want to follow them back to America and see if they make the Haveli a home with at least hot water and updated bathrooms. And how now at least 5 years into their marriage how they have learned each other's customs and how the families have adjusted.

I'm WASP; my difficult, critical mother-in-law was Hispanic \u2013 but the dynamic I experienced was very similar to Alison's. The colorful cast of characters in her new husband's extended family brings back memories of my own experience marrying into an eccentric clan I didn't understand.

This is how I felt reading Alison Singh Gee's book. I found myself giving in to her writing, taking in India's countryside, her new family there, the haveli, the bright pops of color in the wheat fields, and the food. Astonishing.

It gave me insight into a country and people I know so little about and helped me understand the caste system and how it still survives in this day and time. It was interesting to see how Ajay's family came to accept Ms. Gee and how she came to understand them. It was distracting that she used Indian words and did not explain most of them.

She has a rich expat British boyfriend with the amazing flat, a wardrobe that includes Diane Von Furstenberg wraps and a social calendar packed with outings at the hottest spots. She trades all that in, when she meets Ajay. Underneath the glamour, Gee\u2019s narrative is an honest look at the complexity of her existence. While Gee\u2019s pre-Ajay life in Hong Kong looks lustrous, there\u2019s haunting pain from a life left back in The States. The reader is taken back and forth between moments in the author\u2019s life that are pivotal in marking her journey.What captured me most about Gee\u2019s writing is her candid, open examination of self - her admission of appreciating what money can afford catalyzes her search for a personal deeper meaning. Gee\u2019s writing is steeped in humanity. It is easy for the readers of Gee\u2019s narrative to lose themselves in the lustrous, palatable images that define Hong Kong and India. (I, myself, could not help but loll over food scenes and crave parathas or chai.) However, Gee goes beyond examining these locations (which are usually romanticized/exoticized by Western travelers) with a superficial eye.In searching for her own authentic self, she illuminates the cultures of the worlds she inhabits by drawing out their colorful, beautiful contradictions. In Hong Kong, her rich friends are not idealized. In India, she shows what personal interaction is like across class/caste lines. She is not in India to gain some mystical experience or superficial philosophical understanding by sitting in an ashram and meditating all day. She is there to experience life and pursue her heart. And, that is what she hands the reader through her words. Because of this, Gee's open soul emerges from the pages.Gee\u2019s personal journey is universal at its core. It is about loss and love. It is about finding beauty and contentment in the most unexpected circumstances. It is a meditation on the unfolding of life. It is easy to imagine our lives are going to lead us in one direction. And, even if we get what we think we want, it unwraps itself in the most interesting, traversing ways. We only need to be open to possibility. WHERE THE PEACOCKS SING reminds us of that.This fun, beautiful, profound book is a delight to read!"}, {"userName": "Sophfronia Scott", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6007384-sophfronia-scott", "userReview": "A journalist's high-flying life in Hong Kong changes in many ways, expected and unexpected, when she breaks up with her wealthy boyfriend and embarks on a relationship that challenges her identity, values and convictions. That's the basic storyline of this captivating memoir by Alison Singh Gee. But before I continue, a couple of notes:1.) Full disclosure: Alison and I were People magazine colleagues for several years and we share the same literary agent. I didn't know much of her personal history, though, so this book held many discoveries for me.2.) Before you read this book I highly recommend you go to www.bestchai.com and order some Adivasi chai. You're going to crave some decent chai, and not the kind they make with syrup at Starbucks. Adivasi is as close to the real thing as you're going to get without going to an Indian restaurant. Chai flows through this book like a river and I craved it just as I craved red pepper and olive oil sandwiches after reading \"The Godfather.\" Be prepared.This type of craving, though, highlights a strength in the book. The reader, while navigating the inner landscape of Alison's troubled childhood, also gets to experience the mysterious beauty of India. The author does an admirable job of engaging all the senses as she brings to the pages the food, flora and fauna, pink skies and dusty roads that lead to her husband's ancestral home, the palace known as Mokimpur.I appreciated the contrast between the fast moving artifice of Hong Kong and the restorative calm she finds at Mokimpur. As she is tugged between the two worlds, the author is made aware of the importance of living in the moment, accepting imperfection, and the virtue of not throwing anything away, especially people. The ongoing tension in the book is whether or not the lessons will sink in. After all, the palace isn't quite what she thought it would be, certain sacrifices must be made, and the lure of her previous life is strong. Walking through this journey made for a pleasant read and the perfect escape from a snowy winter day in Connecticut. Think I'll have another cup of chai now."}, {"userName": "Christine Carr", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16440724-christine-carr", "userReview": "As a girl, did you dream of marrying a handsome prince who would take you to live in his palace? What might that look like in 2013? Surprisingly, author Alison Singh Gee gets to find out, and shares her tumultuous journey in this magical and compelling book. She flees her troubled family in Los Angeles for a glamorous jet set life in Hong Kong. But the feeling of wealth and status is no match when real love blossoms between her and another journalist. Alison takes a deep and heartfelt look at her family history and relationship with money when living with her new love means watching every penny. The tension of love and money, and what is enough, runs throughout the book. Her love turns out to be the prince with an actual palace in India; but when she arrives there, Alison discovers the palace is crumbling after decades of neglect, and a thorny pack of in-laws are not so eager to welcome her there.No summary can give the same experience of reading this magical book, to walk through each step as Alison embraces her love, her in-laws and a new understanding of herself. I read this book while holding it over my infant daughter's sleeping head, and looked forward to every nap so I could get back to this story.Alison's vivid writing brings you directly into each scene; the light, the smells, the people and surroundings, allowing you to feel yourself a part of each moment, feeling the surprises, shocks, discoveries, heartbreaks and joys along with her.I loved this book and strongly recommend it - I had our book club read it and they loved it as well, we had such a great discussion about it.I also gave this book to my mother-in-law who grew up in India - she now has \"Peacocks\" prominently displayed on her coffee table.

In her sparkling memoir, journalist Alison Singh Gee learns that love, riches, and a place to call home can be found in the most unexpected places.Alison Singh Gee was a glamorous magazine writer with a serious Jimmy Choo habit, a weakness for five-star Balinese resorts, and a reputation for dating highborn British men. Then she met Ajay, a charming and unassuming Indian journalist, and her world turned upside down. Traveling from her shiny, rapid-fire life in Hong Kong to Ajay's native village, Alison learns that not all is as it seems.
