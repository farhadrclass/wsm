Very short read, finished in about an hour. It's Darcy's diary from freshmen year through senior year. Doesn't tell us too much we didn't already know but it was good! Says to be continues at the end... So maybe more is coming?!"}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/879591-sara", "userReview": "This was a really cute novella. Those who've enjoyed the author's first two novels, Something Borrowed and Something Blue, are the target audience, as this is Darcy's diary while she and Rachel are in high school. Darcy's as self-involved as you'd expect, but she's somehow quite endearing, making mistakes that she later regrets and caring about her friends despite all the times they drive her crazy.The author nails Darcy's voice perfectly, and I loved the way she changed throughout the pages, as well as all the ways in which she stayed the same (especially when it came to boys). Since Darcy's one of the main characters in the aforementioned novels, you already know she's not going to suddenly become a better person, and some of her decisions in here are already known. Still, she's charming enough that you continually care what happens to her and root for her throughout. I really enjoyed this short insight into Darcy's high school mind, and it was easy to view her as a friend. I wish the story had been longer, but the end noted that it was to be continued, so I'm hoping that perhaps there will be a sequel that continues to detail Darcy and Rachel's friendship before we were originally introduced to them in Something Borrowed. Reading this reminded me just how much I enjoyed those novels; I may have to reread them one of these days. If you enjoyed them, this is something you should definitely read!"}, {"userName": "Ana", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5535712-ana", "userReview": "I'm a huge fan of Emily Giffin, so it came naturally that I liked this story. Too bad it's so short though. Darcy is...oh well, same old Darcy, the one that has to have it all perfect. It was nice to see what she was up to in High School, guys she dated, the friendship with Rachel (who was even back than super smart and protective). I don't know how Emily Giffin does it, but I swear to God, I just can't hate Darcy! I just can't! Yes she's shallow, and she's probably everything I used to hate about girls when I was in high School (The Drama Queens) but it's all Emily's fault. Even a snob like Darcy managed to get under my skin.Though I really enjoyed it and it's such a short read you might finish in less than an hour, I just couldn't give it more than 3 stars. Looking forward to reading Where We Belong and hope I'll love it as much as I loved \"Something borrowed\" and \"Something blue\"."}, {"userName": "Lyndsay", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8213760-lyndsay", "userReview": "The Diary of Darcy J. Rhone is a cute prequel to Emily Giffin's Something Borrowed and Something Blue. There isn't much new information revealed. However, the first-person, diary format of a teenaged Darcy does provide a little insight into why 29 soon to be 30 year old Darcy is who she is. It's a quick read, and anyone who enjoyed the saga of Rachel and Darcy in Giffin's first two novels would most definitely get a little enjoyment out of this eBook freebie."}, {"userName": "Rachel Jaffe", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/611323-rachel-jaffe", "userReview": "I've read Something Borrowed and Something Blue, both of which I enjoyed in a chick-lit sort of way. So when I saw this \"prequel\" as a Kindle freebie, I figured, \"why not?\"and that's about how it turned out - a \"why not?\" read. It was light and readable. It probably wouldn't be that interesting to someone who hadn't read at least one of the other books with these characters.No reason not to read it, but also not a lot of reasons *to* read it."}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33943459-brenda", "userReview": "what the heck?

Thank you for that!But I must say.....ugh! I forgot how much I hated annoying Darcy until I started reading this! I started this all excited but as I read on....again, ugh!!!! I LOVED Something Borrowed and honestly didn't like Something Blue except when Dex and Rachel were involved, and sometimes Ethan. Darcy was a character I just could not get into. Also, this ends right at the part where it would have gotten good! Who doesn't want to know exactly what she was thinking when Rachel told her about Dex the first time, after she met Dex the first time, after she went out with Dex the first time??? My only condolence is that it didn't \"End\" it said \"To Be Continued\".... I HOPE SO!!!!A nice bonus though was an excerpt from Giffin's next book Where We Belong. Looks good, I'm in!"}, {"userName": "Tammy DeStefano", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9752367-tammy-destefano", "userReview": "I love Emily Griffin's work and this was a nice quick read. It could easily be expanded and turned into another novel, as Darcy and Rachel are an enjoyable duo! My one complaint was the location, I understand this is fiction, but being from the area I was confused. It's suppose to be set in Naperville, Indiana, yet everything describes Naperville, IL (a real town). From the high school rivals, Portillo's Hot Dogs (which aren't available in IN), the Ogden 6 movie theater and even the call to Monica used Illinois Department of Health, not Indiana Department of Health. My pet peeve is when fiction authors use real towns but have incorrect facts (such as the STATE). I normally wouldn't know this but when it's an area you know well it can be quite distracting."}, {"userName": "Kathryn", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6504379-kathryn", "userReview": "The Diary of Darcy J. Rhone is a super quick read. It gives you some insight as to who Darcy, the best friend in Something Borrowed and the main character in Something Blue, was in high school. It's really sad how shallow she is, but after you read some of her diary entries and learn about some different things in her past, you have a better idea of who she is and why she does what she does. This was also free on Amazon, and if you're a Giffin fan, you might pick this up. It's not the best read ever, but hey! It was FREE! Some parts were funny, cute, made you think about your high school days, but gave you insight on Darcy's life."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9496297-michael", "userReview": "I never actually read Something Borrowed because I saw the movie long before. I figured I'd give this a try because a) it was super short, and b) it was free. It's a good thing because this was almost painful to read. If you're familiar with Darcy's character as an adult, I'm sure you can imagine how she was as a teen. This little novella just reconfirmed how irritating she is."}, {"userName": "Tara", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4612683-tara", "userReview": "let me start off by saying that i loved something borrowed and something blue. but this? i couldn't wait for it to end. it wasn't interesting at all. it was VERY darcy (OBNOXIOUS). actually, it was too much darcy. at least it was free.."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2029510-lisa", "userReview": "I was checking out the top reads on Kindle and came across this short story. Having read all of Emily Giffin's books and loving them, especially the two featuring Darcy, (Something Borrowed and Something Blue) I was excited to see this offered for free, though I would have paid for it anyway because I was eager to take a look into Darcy's past as a teen.It's a cute story told from the POV of Darcy and written as her high school diary, it gives insight into what Darcy was like back in high school. Here's a hint: just she was in Something Borrowed. If you are a fan of Ms Giffin's books and have read the \"Something\" books, you will enjoy this. It took me less than an hour to read. My only complaint is that I wish it were longer, but it does say \"to be continued\" at the end. Hopefully, there will be more to come. As a bonus, there is a sneak peak of Were We Belong, the upcoming novel from Emily Giffin included at the end."}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3988752-emily", "userReview": "This was a cute little addition to the Something Borrowed and Something Blue collection. It was a very short read, I finished it in less than an hour. It is Darcy's diary from her freshman through senior years of high school. It is written in true Darcy fashion. Lots of comments about boys and parties and being popular. And lots of remarks about Rachel being boring and studying to hard and so on. It was nice to be able to \"look back\" on them in their high school years. I think Emily Giffin is a fantastic writer and I love Rachel and Darcy. I only wish there more books in that series. I recommend this quick read to anyone who's a fan of those books. It's a fun little reminder of the pair and it made me want to go back and read Something Borrowed and Something Blue again. :-)"}, {"userName": "Marco", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11265182-marco", "userReview": "This short story was available for free on the Google play store, and I decided to give it a try even if I did not know what type of books Emily Griffin writes. It turns out she writes romantic comedies, that it is definitely not what I usually enjoy reading. The main character is Darcy, a gorgeous and shallow girl. The author tries (and sometimes succeed) to make the reader smile focusing on Darcy's shortcomings, on her inappropriate words and actions. Unfortunately I can see many of these as tragically real and typical in teenagers (of any generation), and that leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. The smile dies on my lips when I heard jokes on real issues like teen bulimia or STDs."}, {"userName": "Alicia", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/721421-alicia", "userReview": "This was kind of pointless. All it did was fill in gaps from Something Borrowed ( i.e. the true story of the SAT score and Notre Dame). Part of the charm of Something Blue was reading about Darcy's transformation. I had no interest in going back and reading about when Darcy was at her worst.I really could have done without this prequel and just gotten the preview of the new book by itself.Thankfully its short and sweet- written in diary format complete with artwork. I think it took me less than 30 minutes to finish it, so I can't complain."}, {"userName": "Juliana", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4191039-juliana", "userReview": "I was so happy to see this book on her facebook page:) It only took me about 30 mins to read it.

The Something Borrowed, and Something Blue books are some of my favorite things that I have ever read. We don't get any of Darcy's perspective until she is forced to grow up in Something Blue.
