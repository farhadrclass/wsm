But this was a case where, when I sat down to do the review, I decided to change the rating. Corrie's personal narrative of her World War II experiences genuinely are \"amazing,\" in the true sense of the word --both in terms of what she and others went through, what they were called on to do, and the attitude that she and her sister were able to take toward it all. And while, other things being equal, I prefer fiction to nonfiction when I'm reading for pleasure, this book consists of narrative --\"story,\" if you will-- that has the same intrinsic appeal as fiction (perhaps more, simply because it is true) and is every bit as gripping and engrossing.Of course, Corrie's story is inseparably steeped with her deep Christian faith, and is impossible to understand apart from it. Obedient love for God and for other people created by God was the motivating force for Corrie and her family to do what they did, and for the spirit in which they did it. For a Christian believer such as myself, her story is an inspiration to the same type of self-sacrifice and loyalty, a testament to the ability of Divine empowerment to bring out extraordinary possibilities in \"ordinary\" people, and a record of God's saving and helping acts in the nitty-gritty world of daily life, such as Corrie's never-failing vitamin bottle. (Any attempt to explain all of these away as \"coincidence,\" IMHO, stretches the long arm of coincidence out of its shoulder socket!)."}, {"userName": "Meg", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1009267-meg", "userReview": "Every human being should be required to read this book. I guarantee it will change forever the way you look at life. The memoir is a true account of Corrie Ten Boom's experiences in German-occupied Holland during WWII (and afterward in prisons and concentration camps). The most amazing thing to me is that she was not Jewish. She was a Dutch Christian who freely sacrificed her own life, and the lives of those she loved most, to fight against cruelty and hate. I read the book aloud to my husband, taking a break at some point in each chapter just because I couldn't read for the tears. I can understand overcoming amid tragedy, but thanking God for the fleas that are eating your flesh? Praying for the guard who beats you? Two questions kept going through my head in the journey with Corrie: \"Are there really people in the world who are this GOOD?\" and \"Why am I such a selfish, ungrateful, spoiled brat?\"I loved the paradox of a tragedy not told as tragedy. Unimaginably horrible things happen... and yet it's told as a wonderful story of forgiveness, faith, and gratitude for the constant miracles and mercies of God. Unbelievable. Probably my #1 recommendation for people who feel like they need an attitude adjustment - it certainly adjusted mine. Permanently.And please don't say, \"ANOTHER Holocaust book?\" I hate it when people say that. As far as I'm concerned, I'll be terrified the day we STOP writing them.FAVORITE QUOTES:\"Corrie... do you know what hurts so very much? It's love. Love is the strongest force in the world, and when it is blocked that means pain. There are two things we can do when this happens. We can kill the love so that it stops hurting. But then of course part of us dies, too. Or, Corrie, we can ask God to open up another route for that love to travel. God loves Karel--even more than you do--and if you ask Him, He will give you His love for this man, a love nothing can prevent, nothing destroy. Whenever we cannot love in the old, human way, Corrie, God can give us the perfect way.\"\"It is wrong to base faith upon wishes. There will be war. The Germans will attack and we will fall... Oh, my dears, I am sorry for all Dutchmen now who do not know the power of God. For we will be beaten. But He will not.\"\"Father held the baby close, his white beard brushed its cheek, looking into the little face with eyes as blue and innocent as the baby's own. At last he looked up at the pastor. 'You say we could lose our lives for this child. I would consider that the greatest honor that could come to my family.'\"\"There are no 'ifs' in God's Kingdom. His timing is perfect. His will is our hiding place. Lord Jesus, keep me in Your will! Don't let me go mad by poking about outside it.\"MY FAVORITE STORY:\"One dark morning when ice was forming a halo around each street lamp, a feeble-minded girl two rows ahead of us suddenly soiled herself. A guard rushed at her, swinging her thick leather crop while the girl shrieked in pain and terror. It was always more terrible when one of these innocent ones was beaten. Still [she] continued to whip her... I was grateful when the screaming girl at last lay still on the cinder street.\"'Betsie,' I whispered when the guard was far enough away, 'what can we do for these people? Afterward I mean. Can't we make a home for them and care for them and love them?'\"'Corrie, I pray every day that we will be allowed to do this! To show them that love is greater!'\"And it wasn't until I was gathering twigs later in the morning that I realized that I had been thinking of the feeble-minded, and Betsie of their persecutors.\""}, {"userName": "Natalie Vellacott", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34178791-natalie-vellacott", "userReview": "Most people have started 2018 with parties and fireworks. I've started it by finishing a five star book!I've read The Hiding Place a few times before but not in recent years. With so many Christian friends on Goodreads, it is the book that I see most often on people's 'favourite' shelf. During this re-read I was reminded that it deserves to be there.Most of you will know the story; Corrie ten Boom and her sister Betsie are the unmarried daughters of Casper, a Christian watchmaker in Holland during the early 1900's. They could be running a successful and profitable business but, as Christians, are prone to charity and acts of kindness leaving them comfortable but not well-off. The scene is set by the author, Corrie, and a picture of a happy family life emerges. The everyday details and the author's humour are what make the book, indeed she is a marvellous story-teller and none of it is in any way monotonous.During the Nazi occupation in the late 1930's, the ten Boom family adapt their business to harbour Jewish refugees as they become involved in the underground movement of the period. Corrie, in particular, devotes her time and attention to caring for and helping these persecuted people and takes great risks in the process.Eventually, their happy family life, which had gradually been eroded by events on the horizon, is shattered as the entire family are captured and led off to Germany. Corrie and her sister Betsie end up in Ravensbruck, a notorious concentration camp. Here, Corrie faces up to her spiritual weakness as her physical body suffers:Selfishness took on a life of its own...Oh this was the great ply of Satan in that kingdom of his:To display such blatant evil that one could almost believe that one's own secret sins didn't matter....I came to Paul's account of his thorn in the flesh...the real sin lay in thinking that any power to help and transform came from me. Of course it was not my wholeness, but Christ's that made the difference.The breakthrough comes when Corrie, following the example of her never wavering sister who even praises God for the fleas, realises that all is not in vain and life has a purpose again:But as the rest of the world grew stranger, one thing became increasingly clear. And that was the reason the two of us were here. Why others should suffer we were not shown. As for us, from morning until lights out, whenever we were not in ranks for roll call, our Bible was the center of an ever-widening circle of help and hope. Like waifs clustered round a blazing fire, we gathered about it, holding out our hearts to it warmth and light. The blacker the night around us grew, the brighter and truer and more beautiful burned the word of God. 'Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword...Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.What an incredible picture of true faith in the face of such hardness and suffering. Anyone going through trials will benefit from this book. Likewise those seeking to be content in all circumstances and to rejoice in the Lord always.The Hiding Place is clean: there is no swearing or blasphemy, there is no sexual content, there are some graphic scenes relating to the treatment of prisoners and the suffering in the concentration camp. These are relayed factually without embellishment or sensationalism.An incredible testimony of a family completely sold out for God whatever the cost."}, {"userName": "Greta", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45248887-greta", "userReview": "If you consider reading this book, be warned. When John and Elizabeth Sherrill wrote the memoir of Corrie ten Boom, they clearly had an agenda. The first half of the book was okay. That's the reason I gave it 2 and not 1 star. The second half, set during the war years and Corrie's imprisonment in Ravensbruck, was all about worshipping God and Jesus, praying, miracles and prophecies. Even for all the cruelties that happened, there was a higher divine plan. At some point, In Ravensbruck, they were thanking god for being naked (in front of SS guards) because Jesus was naked on his cross too. And they thanked god for the fleas and the lice, so the guards wouldn't enter the barracks and they could read the bible and worship god. Obviously they were ignorant of the diseases caused by the vermin. There was also a miraculous, never ending bottle of vitamins, that was allegedly smuggled into the camp by Corrie, together with her bible. The authors made saints of Corrie and Betsie, instead of writing a believable memoir. And in the appendix to the book, you can put this book to work in your own life. I can only recommend this to deeply devout people. There are over 7.000 reviews of this book and I have never seen that much 5 star ratings. But only a handful of reviewers understood the ultimate purpose of the book :\"it's rather insulting to the millions of Jews and others who died that fervent prayer to Jesus is all that was necessary to avoid death\" ; \"made me feel the tone was rather subtly supremist\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...\"Just one of many examples of how this book turns a story about World War II into a platform for evangelical tripe.\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...\"The unspoken theme is that they were saved because they were Christian, unlike the Jews. This is definitely the Disney version of WWII.\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...\"Its problem is that throughout it pushes religion. Honestly, when an author expects me, as a reader, to actually believe that any religious doctrine is the truth I feel like my intelligence is being insulted and it is downright offensive.\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...\"it seems to be a bit whitewashed in the veil of faith in Jesus to solve all, in prayers that constantly come through and in the miracle of the never ending vitamins.

I've underlined so many parts of this book! I first read this with my first book club almost 10 years ago and read it back in October with my current book club -- still find it absolutely amazing and one I want to read and re-read. One of my favorite themes of the book is stated by the author on page 31: \"the experiences of our lives, when we let God use them, become the mysterious and perfect preparation for the work He will give us to do.\" Goes along with my belief that all things will work together for our good. Not that only good things will happen to us, but that all things will work for our good. Even when our Father takes us, not to \"the windmill ... or swans on the canal\" but somewhere where we don't want to go and we howl and struggle all the way (p. 40). We can trust in Him that all things will work together for our good. Another favorite part is in the example of Betsie, the author's sister, who gives thanks in all circumstances, even for the fleas (p. 210). Several pages later, the author explains how even the fleas worked together for their good (p.220). Even when we may not always have the \"whys\", we can trust in Him that our experiences are for our good. I found it amazing when Nollie is asked by if Annaliese is a Jew and she responds, \"yes.\" Nollie's perfect honesty requires that she answer \"yes\" even when it may mean death for someone who has trusted them! Nollie has perfect faith that no suffering will come to Annaliese because Nollie obeyed Him in being honest in all things. Miraculously and sure enough, Annaliese is set free. As a mother, I have always wondered how the Jewish people hid their children (crying babies etc.) from the Nazis when they were in hiding. I found it poignant and sad when the author noted that \"even the youngest had developed the uncanny silence of small hunted things\" (p. 114). Above all, I love this book for its reminder to me of the eternal perspective. How true that He can give us His perspective when we feel trapped in the reality of filthy and cramped barracks, His way of seeing people who we cannot understand, His forgiveness for those who have hurt us, His love for those we think we cannot love, and His strength to replace our weaknesses. Which leads me to a final favorite quote and life-lesson I've learned: \"When He tells us to love our enemies [or any other thing He has asked us to do], He gives, along with the command the love itself\" (p. 248)."}, {"userName": "Leila", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15194189-leila", "userReview": "I have read this book before many years ago., but reading about it here on Goodreads reminded me how much I had been absorbed and overwhelmed by the courage and utter dedication of this young woman (the author) and I valued it highly. Although Corrie is a deeply commited Christian you don't have be of any particular religion to read and appreciate this book. She risked everything including her life during World War II to save as many Jews as possible from the Nazi regime in Holland. She and her older sister Betsie lived through terrifying times to achieve this and endured starvation, torture and humiliation when captured by the Gestapo. The first half of the book is more about her daily life as the daughter of a man widely acclaimed as a watch and clock maker and repairer and a member of a loving family. The second part is all about how they devote their lives to the rescue of Jews from the enemy. Corrie and her sister have a powerful faith in God and the story is inspiring but heartrending.

It\u2019s a heartbreaking, painful read. It\u2019s also full of faith, strength, kindness and perseverance. I\u2019m very glad I gave it a listen. The narrator is terrific and emotive and has the ability to draw you into the time and place instead of taking you out of it! Corrie ten Boom is a 40 something spinster at peace with her quiet life. She is a watchmaker in her father\u2019s shop and lives with her older sister and their kind father. She never expected to become embroiled in an underground revolution but when German soldiers invade her homeland and friends and neighbors start to disappear because they are Jewish or lending Jewish families safe harbor, she can\u2019t stand by and do nothing. As conditions become increasingly worse for the unfortunate people in her beloved town, she decides to put her life in danger in order to save those of others. Her family has a hidden room built and they take in the desperate. Eventually she is imprisoned, along with most of her family. She recounts the long, grueling days of hellish conditions in prison and in concentration camps. The sickness, the starvation and the everyday cruelties inflicted. I\u2019m not religious but these characters are and they walk with a strong belief and unwavering (for the most part) faith and a gratitude for everything, even ants and fleas, yet I never felt preached at. Their faith makes up a big part of who they were and how they managed to make it through the inhumane conditions. If you read this account, it will leave a mark on you for certain.

That's the best I can do on a book that came highly recommended and that I read with relish as I had just been to Amsterdam and surrounding areas, visited the Museum of the Resistance and the old Jewish Synagogue referred to in the book. So why two stars? I just didn't believe a lot of what I read. Here's what I do believe. I think Corrie, her sister Betsy, her father and other family members were courageous, passionate, religious, pro-active and bold. They did what many in Holland did, but what many chose not to do. They put their lives on the line to help with a very unpopular cause. They risked their necks to hide jews, feed them, comfort them and resist the authority of their German invaders. In that I find them commendable. The father figure was an admirable man, a man of principle who lived truly an exemplary life and imparted his teachings to not only his family, but all who surrounded him. A man of peace, but of strong determination. A man of immensely strong faith which he passed along to his children. So far, so good. So what's my squabble? The book was written a full 25 years after the facts, and I think it shows. Corrie was in her late 70's when the book was written, and it was written by two people who weren't there. The narrative at times becomes too convenient, too sugar coated. There were no fights amongst the throngs of people living in the beje. I think the old saying that \"time heals everything\" clearly applies to this book, as it seems to be a bit whitewashed in the veil of faith in Jesus to solve all, in prayers that constantly come through and in the miracle of the never ending vitamins. Call me a sceptic, but I found the constant references to Jesus annoying. I most certainly think we all believe in God when in the trenches, but I don't believe in the Santa Claus God who gave to Corrie, but perhaps withheld from others who were praying just as hard. It came across as preachy and childish all these years later. So many people were hurt, humiliated, beaten, and brutally murdered -- and I am sure just about each and every one of them prayed to their Jesus as well.To end on a positive note -- the faith that this family had, the true faith in doing the right thing -- is admirable; when Corrie wrote \"released\" in her jail cell to signify the death of (blank), she showed a deep and profound faith in that death is not the end, only a fresh start in a better place.

They assisted in the Dutch underground movement helping several hundred Jews and others in peril to escape imminent arrest, persecution and execution that would have inevitably come to those they were helping all the while realizing that these activities were likely to be reported to the authorities. But even more so, I was struck by the forgiving natuure within this family even for their persecutors. It is easy to pray for the sick, the needy, the downtrodden. But to pray for those who were behind the terrors and daily tortures of their incarceration - the kinds of torture often found during times of war - takes faith in God to a level above that of even the most devout Christians. But that is the kind of faith found in this family. They even found a reason to be thankful for the fleas infesting their prison halls.

This horrible thing didn't just affect \"them\"/\"those other people\" (oh isn't that sad?, what's for dinner?\") but it affected the whole world.

Eventually betrayed, she wound up in a Gestapo prison for a few months, then doing forced labor in the Vught Concentration Camp, which harsh as it was, was paradisaical compared to where she next wound up until released, the notorious Ravensbruck Concentration Camp. This is her first person account, written decades after the fact with the help of John and Elizabeth Sherrill. It got off to what I found a slow start in the first four chapters which tells of the life of her and her family before World War II. I thought it picked up in pace a great deal in the later chapters once it began to tell of her involvement aiding Jews in the Underground, and from that moment I was completely engrossed--and indeed the story, particularly before they were betrayed to the Nazis, sometimes surprised me with its warmth and humor. Her father, for instance, never really understood why all the Resistance people were calling themselves \"Smit\" and kept asking whether they were related to this or that Smit family he knew.I picked up the book because it was recommended on the Ultimate Reading List in the \"Inspirational Non-fiction\" section. For \"inspirational\" read \"religious\" and almost always \"Christian\" and I indeed found it in the \"Christian Inspiration\" section. Some reviews complained about the religiosity, but it really didn't bother me--and I'm an atheist with little patience when I feel I'm being preached at. Perhaps it's just that I took this in stride as part and parcel of Miss Ten Boom. That faith was just as much as the foundation of her thinking and deeds as Hinduism was for Ghandi or Buddhism for the Dalai Llama. There's nothing smug or self-righteous in her tone. Nor did she come across as \"goodie two shoes\" to me--she sometimes understandably struggled with anger and fear. She's human--although in my book still a hero. I even saw one review that called her a \"bigot.\" That couldn't be further from the truth. The Ten Booms saved many Jews, hiding them in their own home at great risk to themselves, tried to serve them kosher food when they could, celebrated the Sabbath with them and Jewish holidays. I saw no sign of bigotry towards those of other beliefs. Having a strong faith that a person takes seriously in deciding how to act does not make one a bigot. Anyone who mistakes that for bigotry has their own issues with anti-Christian bigotry in my opinion.On the other hand, I do agree with one reviewer that I suspect that her Christian faith did \"sugar coat\" things more than a little and probably colored her recollection. I don't think Ten Boom ever consciously shaded the truth, but especially given this was recounted almost thirty years later when Ten Boom was in her seventies, I do wonder if time put a gloss on memories such as the vitamin drop \"miracle.\" Anne Frank's account of hiding in an Amsterdam annex from the Nazis came directly from her diaries written very close to events. Viktor E. Frankl's story of his experiences in four Concentration Camps including Auschwitz, Man's Search for Meaning, was written by him in nine days within months of his liberation. Elie Wiesel's story of his time in Auschwitz, Night was written in his twenties within a decade after his experiences there. The Hiding Place doesn't have the freshness and intensity of those accounts. Also, though it tells an extraordinary story, it's not always extraordinarily well-written when I compare it to the other books mentioned above. I read Frankl's account just before this book, and read Wiesel's book for the second time less than two months ago. Those are powerful accounts that deserve the name literature. This doesn't, which is why I haven't rated it nearly as highly as those other two books. But it's still a often gripping, at times moving book."}, {"userName": "Annalisa", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/542037-annalisa", "userReview": "If you have not read the book, it is the true account of a Dutch woman in her 50s who sets up an underground Jewish haven during the Nazi rule over Holland. I love reading about the Holocaust, but this was the first time I could sense such a chasm between a sweet, elderly, epitome-of-Christian woman and the cruel hatred of the Nazi camps.Even before the war, the family's charity and service was inspiring. During the war, their optimism, stalwartness, and charity was amazing. Corrie would trust her instincts as being directed by God, and sure enough they were protected from harm around every corner. When they were finally discovered, her amazing sister not only was filled with nothing but sympathy for the Nazis' hatred, but looked at every evil as opportunity: the more crammed the camp became the more women they had to teach the gospel, the dirtier the conditions the less intrusion from the guards, etc. I like to think I am optimistic, but I have my breaking point and then I'm irritable. The true test of our character comes under stressful times and their willingness to search for service in the trenches of hatred was heart warming.I have often wondered if I would risk my family's life to protect another, but I have never questioned whether or not I would lie. I would have lied to the Nazis and had no moral regrets about it. Connie's sister-in-law was so dedicated to honesty she told her children they would be rewarded for their honesty. And sure enough, when they told Nazi enquirers dangerous information, they were always protected. That made me question my own commitment to honesty.The family experienced their share of sadness and loss, but even after the war, Connie opened her heart and home to those displaced by the war, including the Nazis. I am not a crier and yet as I reached the close of this book, I found my eyes watering, not out of sorrow, but out of sheer awe at the hand of God in their lives and the power of love in their hearts.

I expected it to be very boring, very depressing, and very preachy. At times it did drag a little - especially at the beginning - and it was sad, but it could be called preachy, and the hope won out in the end. It won out through much of the book, actually; I never felt truly depressed. I just knew God was there. Corrie and Betsie both showed their belief in this truth in the way they dealt with difficult situations.The story starts with a recount of important moments throughout Corrie\u2019s childhood and young adulthood. It gives a history of her family\u2019s business which is a watch repair shop. It gives a good viewpoint of where Corrie\u2019s thought processes, opinions, and beliefs come from. Parts of it didn\u2019t seem important at the time, but I became convinced later that it was important - because it all turned Corrie into the woman she grew into, the woman who lived through what she did.At last the book arrives at the Nazi occupation of Holland. This is when the story really starts to pick up. In their own quiet way, the ten Booms stand up to the Nazis - first by keeping their radio from being confiscated \u2026 and slowly through becoming involved in the Resistance and saving people. They become deeply involved in the Resistance. The book gives us many examples of them risking their lives to save a few people.After having helped many people escape Holland and kept many hidden in the special room behind Corrie\u2019s bedchamber, the ten Booms are found out and raided by the Nazis. Though the people in their \u2018Hiding Place\u2019 stay safe, she and her father and sister and a few others are taken away to a prison camp where most of the remainder of the story takes place.There, Corrie\u2019s father and sister Betsie both die - her father shortly after they arrive and her sister just days before they are released. Over many months in prison and in concentration camps, Betsie and Corrie both minister to others. They are a support and guide to the women there - hosting a Bible study and prayer meeting of sorts, encouraging and lifting up others whenever they can.I wonder if Betsie was a little white-washed in Corrie\u2019s mind by her death, as she seems like one of those too-good-to-be-real characters - another Elsie Dinsmore, if you will. But she was definitely very noble - if a little too optimistic for her own good, methinks.Corrie was the narrator and the main character, of course, and I found myself liking her more than other characters. She had a lot of common sense and gumption.Later I found out that she was just released because of an error and the rest of the women in her group were killed shortly afterwards. Well, of course we know it wasn\u2019t an \u2018error,\u2019 exactly. It was God!The point of this book is, of course, that God is there even when things are dark - even when it seems like there is no life, there is no hope. He is our hiding place in time of trouble.This book can teach you so much \u2026 about history, about people, and most of all, about God. It\u2019s really an incredible work - and the fact that it\u2019s a true story makes it even more impressive.The author was very honest about the tough things she went through and the things she saw others go through. And yes, it was horrific \u2026 but the message of seeing God in it all was incredible! I wish everyone who had to go through anything traumatic or horrific could read this book. It would do them a world of good!Since these are real life people, not characters, and since this is a real life story, not a plot, I won\u2019t critique this book on those points. The writing style was excellent - it was plain and truthful while getting the point across without preaching.My mom got emotional about this book. I did not. Not much upsets me. But it was very emotional what with everything they had to go through and then how it all wrapped up. I can see how some people might cry when they read it.I really enjoyed this book and would definitely recommend it.Kellyn Roth, Reveries Reviews"}, {"userName": "Candi", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3639005-candi", "userReview": "The Hiding Place is a story about how the depths of faith and spirituality can get a person through even the darkest nightmare. Corrie ten Boom and her family led the Dutch Underground during the Nazi occupation of Holland, aiding and hiding Jewish people in a secret room in their home above their watchmaker shop. Their efforts eventually cost them their freedom and in some cases, their lives. Corrie and members of her family are arrested and sent to a concentration camp. This is not exactly a new story; we have heard numerous inspirational stories of people who have suffered monstrosities beyond our imagination. What sets Corrie\u2019s story apart from many, though most surely not all, is that her family had the capacity for allowing their faith to grow even more throughout these times of torment. They shared their love, their hidden Bible, and their love of God with all those who would listen. They looked at the smallest things as a gift. Most of all, they understood the true meaning of forgiveness and how it can set one\u2019s soul free. Upon meeting one of her former S.S. jailers at a church service years after these events, Corrie struggled to eventually accept the hand held out to her by this man. \u201cAs I took his hand the most incredible thing happened. From my shoulder along my arm and through my hand, a current seemed to pass from me to him, while into my heart sprang a love for this stranger that almost overwhelmed me.\u201dWhat I struggled with the most in this account is the idea that Corrie and her sister Betsey attributed all of their strength to God alone. They did not personally take credit for any of their courage or capabilities. Corrie later states \u201cIf I had ever needed proof that I had no boldness or cleverness of my own, I had it now. Whatever bravery or skill I had ever shown were gifts of God \u2013 sheer loans from Him of the talent needed to do a job.\u201d I don\u2019t believe these gifts are taken away from us. I do believe she had these gifts all along and should congratulate herself on having the knowledge and strength to use these gifts in such a powerful way. Her feelings that these gifts were later absent were possibly a result of a bit of natural fear and vulnerability due to all she endured, not because something was given and then taken away from her. Despite the fact that I found this memoir informative and the ten Booms admirable, there was a bit something lacking in the storytelling. It fell a bit flat for me and was maybe due to the span of time between when these events occurred and when this story was written. It perhaps lacked a bit of the urgency and poignancy I have come to expect. On the other hand, it still remains a very interesting book. I gave this 3.5 stars rounded to 4 stars for the heroism shown by the ten Booms and for my admiration of their undying faith and the inspiration they offered to hundreds of individuals during their time of need."}, {"userName": "\u263c\u2644J\u00fclie \ue301", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20814018-j-lie", "userReview": "**It should be mentioned that this audio version is a retelling of Corrie Ten Boom's memoir, for a modern day audience.Fantastic!

Corrie ten Boom was 48 years old when Hitler invaded her hometown in Holland. She had spent her life caring for the family home and working in her father\u2019s watch shop. But at 50 years of age, she became one of the leaders in the underground resistance in Holland. For 2 \u00bd years, she helped many Jews go into hiding. Not only did she risk her life for this mission, but she also lived her life for it. She spent nearly a year imprisoned in the concentration camps. During that year, she ministered to the other prisoners and the Nazi officials trying to bring them peace and joy. After the war was finally over, she worked to catalyze the healing of both the victims and those who had joined the Nazis. She turned a former concentration camp into a bastion of healing. She traveled around the world teaching people how to forgive and be healed.While lecturing in Germany, she came face to face with one of the guards from the concentration camp. He thanked her for her words and the healing they brought to his soul. As he reached out his hand to shake hers, she was put to the ultimate test. Could she practice what she preached? The anger and hurt swept through her and she despised him. But after she turned it over to God, she was able to touch his hand. And as they shook hands she found that \u201cinto [her] heart sprang a love for this stranger that almost overwhelmed [her].\"What made Corrie become great? It was 50 years of preparation\u2014years of study, years of work, years of service. The Hiding Place is the story of her preparation. Corrie could never have led the resistance, survived the concentration camps, and gone on to become such an inspiration to so many without that vital preparation. She was led by the Voice of Conscience\u2014first in her preparation and later in her life's mission.When you finish reading The Hiding Place, make sure you pick up a copy of Tramp For the Lord.

WWII Holocaust literature is critically important to the story of Western Civilization and it is essential that we all have a few titles get through us so that we never forget what hate and godlessness can do to entire nations. While The Hiding Place has some genuinely tough passages, it is totally unique in that it is never ever hopeless. The very worst moments are lightened up the beautiful witness of Betsey who truly understands the Gospel. Like the Old Testament lamp that never ran out of oil and the Ravensbruck vitamin bottle that never ran out of medicine until new medicine was provided, this story is miraculous in it's ability to keep you filled with just enough hope and just enough awe to keep reading without feeling gutted. To be thankful for the fleas - because they provided incredible miraculous protection from something much worse - is the epitome of the message of the ten Booms and their beautiful true story. Reader who does not think that they can read one more Holocaust book, I understand. I resisted this one for years. Now I understand. I wish that I had read this at the same time that I had read In My Hands and others - it would have given me a healthier helping of hope. 75% of this book is not about the concentration camps.

I want to have that kind of faith.\"This is an amazingly inspiring book. I think often of the lessons I learned from it. Getting the ticket (of strength) just before you get on the train, being grateful for miracles even in the worst of circumstances and having the courage to help others even if you have to place yourself at risk are a few examples.

I sit here at a loss for words because I know that nothing I can say will begin to display the emotions and thoughts swirling around in my mind. Ms. Boom's story touched a piece of me so deeply, I'm afraid that I will never be the same now. Seeing what she saw, hearing what she heard, things such as these will forever be with me. There are so many things that I have learned when it comes to this story, I would like to state just a few of them here below- not enough to give anything in this story away, but enough to draw you in so that you will want to read what this marvelous woman has to say. \"There is no pit so deep that God's love is not deeper still.\" -Casper ten Boom passed on by Corrie. \"'But,' she said, 'this is what the past is for! Every experience God gives us, every person He puts in our lives is the perfect preparation for a future that only He can see.'\" -Corrie ten Boom\"'There is sin in this world, and death and loss are consequences of that sin. But you know what? God feels it too. Every tear we cry? God sheds it too. He hurts with us because He loves us.' Her voice grew soft. 'I felt Him, Trent. When I was all alone, my shoulders shaking from grief, I felt His arms wrap around me and His peace embrace me, and I knew. I wasn't alone, He was with me.'\" -Corrie ten BoomI cannot began to express to each of you enough the need to read this book at least once in your life time. Please, I promise you, you will not be the same after. You will laugh with Corrie, cry with Corrie, cry out with Corrie in the pain she had to endure, but most importantly God will touch your heart with the miracles He provided her with through all of this.

This is the kind of book that changes the way that you see the world. It's given me so many things to think about.Corrie and several members of her family are imprisoned in several different Nazi camps throughout the end of WWII for helping run the \"underground\" operation in Holland. The perspective that is offered throughout this book is absolutely incredible. I'll share with you just a couple of the things that stood out to me.As a young woman, Corrie is totally and completely in love with a friend of her brother, Karel. After finding out that Karel is engaged to another young lady (for financial reasons) Corrie is, of course, devastated. She hides herself in her bedroom, crying and crying. Her father climbs the stairs to offer a few words of wisdom. He explains that \"love is the strongest force in all the world, and when it is blocked that means pain. There are two things we can do when this happens. We can kill the love so that is stops hurting. But then of course part of us dies, too. Or, Corrie, we can ask God to open up another route for that love to travel. . . . Whenever we cannot love in the old, human way, Corrie, God can give us the perfect way.\"Another time, once Holland had been invaded, Corrie lay awake in bed, listening to dogfights going on over head. When she finally heard her sister, Betsie, downstairs in the kitchen and ran down to join her. They sat at the table, talking until the fighting was over and they could return to sleep. As Corrie felt her way to her bed, running her hand across her pillow, she felt a hard, sharp piece of shrapnel, embedded directly in the middle of her pillow. She ran back down the stair, in horror, to show her Betsie. \"'Betsie, if I hadn't heard you in the kitchen-----' But Betsie put a finger on my mouth. 'Don't say it, Corrie! There are no 'if's' in God's world. And no places that are safer than other places. The center of His will is our only safety --- O Corrie, let us pray that we may always know it!'\"This book is filled with forgiveness and joy, even in the most difficult of circumstances. Praying for forgiveness for the Nazis and thanking God for even the fleas! :) A sweet testimony from a remarkable woman!"}, {"userName": "Philip", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71601-philip", "userReview": "In an abundance of Holocaust literature, (and media in general) this book takes a step forward and sets itself apart from the rest.Corrie ten Boom narrates the story of WWII Holland. How the Dutch thought the war wouldn't come to them, but how quickly it came anyway and how the occupation changed everything. She describes her brother bringing home a beaten Jew on the evening of the family watch shop's 100th anniversary.They open their home as the titled Hiding Place.What strikes me is the resolve of everyone involved. There is no whining or complaining, but rather a simple taking of life as it's given. This goes for both Jews and Christians in the story. As is true in all Holocaust stories, it is amazing what people can deal with. But, the joy in the lives of those (Jew and Christian) involved in this story is truly remarkable.Sometimes I wondered if it was too remarkable. The profound wisdom of Corrie's father and the reconciliatory heart of Betsie, her sister made me wonder if Corrie was projecting her own memories of them into her story. But, by the end of the story I thought 1: it's probably accurate because she'd been true to her beliefs and what she'd taught throughout - and how could she make it without that support? And 2: It doesn't matter anyway. At a time when people could have been validated in calling for blood, as was done after WWI, she was calling for forgiveness and reconciliation - traits she presumably learned from her father and had her sister help uplift and carry along with them.Of course, this is ignoring the biggest theme of the book, and the deepest encouragement for Ten Boom: her faith. I was surprised there weren't more negative reviews of the book based on this. I had my defense all lined up, so I'll give it anyway.Corrie was always preaching the Gospel of Christ, but never in a judgmental or demeaning way. To me, the book came across the same way. One was able to tell the steadfastness with which Corrie believed. It was evident that this belief (and those who share her belief would say God Himself) helped carry her through the horrors that all prisoners of the Holocaust faced. It was evangelistic, but she never belittled the Jews she was with, instead recognizing their faith carrying them through as well. In this way she reminded me of Gandhi. She continually took the beatings and imprisonment and continually responded with love (albeit with Civil Disobedience as well.)I don't mean to say she was ecumenical or Universalist by any means. She believed what she believed. (As did Gandhi.) But she was respectful.I was worried that some would feel like it was an attempt to commandeer the Holocaust from the Jews and tell a Christian story instead... and I did find one reviewer that said just that... But the Holocaust was a world tragedy. There is no word in any language to describe the atrocities the Jews were put through during that time. None. But to claim that the Holocaust was only hard on them is foolishness and historically inaccurate. It's insulting to the gypsies, political opponents, mentally handicapped, et al as well as insulting to the Jews themselves. The Ten Booms and Jews stood together as friends; as counterparts, and that shouldn't be trivialized.This was an outstanding story about an outstanding family. Liz and I read it out loud. She would be embarrassed if I told you how many times she cried while reading it. Not that I cried any during the reading. Books can't do that to you - especially not macho tough guys like me, right?"}, {"userName": "Kelley", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/974646-kelley", "userReview": "This book is...how do you say it? If not life-changing, it at least affects your vision, the way you see things, for ever! I was so moved by the sweetness of each story, the love of each family member, the courage of so many. It certainly brought perspective to my own life. I also admired Corrie for being able to recognize the good things she had in her life and for her abilty to express that in writing. I have not read any other hollocaust books on purpose. I have a very sensitive spirit and I've always known that that kind of suffering was too heavy a burden for me to carry. Corrie tells the horrible story of concentration camp life, but infuses it with so much spirituality and light that I was able to read it. I also appreciate the stories from her youth, which helped set the spiritual foundation she would need throughout her ordeal. I will proably always remember the council her father gave to her as a child (about some knowledge being too heavy for her to carry and about the train ticket being given to her when she needs it).
