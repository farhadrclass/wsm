The only problem with them is they stop in mid-Civil War and since one hasn't been written in more than a decade, it is unlikely there will be another.But each of these books captures the strategy and the battle movements better than many other fiction and non-fiction accounts of the war.Starbuck is a bit of a rogue, which makes him more likeable. And Cornwell's research and background for each battle is astounding.This time around, Starbuck is at the Battle of Antietam. His Rebel army continues to get smaller in the face of superior northern resources. But Starbuck fights on, giving hope that one day Cornwell will come to his senses and write another in this amazing series."}, {"userName": "Eric_W", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1711431-eric-w", "userReview": "There are just so many good mysteries out there. The Starbuck books view the Civil War through the eyes of a transplanted New Englander fighting for the Confederacy. This is the 4th in the series. Not being a fan of the Southern point of view, I was reluctant to pick these up, but Cornwell tells such a good tale that they are very difficult to put down. Nothing deep here, just lots of fun. Starbuck in this one has been yanked from his company \u2014 he\u2019s a major \u2014 and assigned to the Yellowlegs, a regiment so-named because they ran away from a fight. Starbuck, unhappy with the assignment, and also a transplanted northerner, arrives at camp only to be mistaken for a drunk Lieutenant Potter, who is late in arriving at his new assignment to the Yellowlegs also (interestingly, yellowlegs was an appellation given to U.S. cavalry troops). Masquerading as Potter, Starbuck soon discovers a pattern of corruption and with the help of his friend Delancey \u2014 who happens to be a Yankee spy unbeknownst to Starbuck \u2014 turns tables on the other officers in the company who had been tormenting him, believing Starbuck to be a lowly lieutenant. The events of the novel revolve around the Battle at Sharpsburg (known as Antietam in the North), the bloodiest battle in United States history, where more than 23,000 soldiers died. McClellan does not fare well, seen rightly so, as a vacillating, reluctant, overanxious general who placed too much reliance on his Pinkerton intelligence. Lee had invaded the North with far fewer troops than McClellan had at his disposal, but McClellan insisted he was outnumbered. Starbuck and his brigade are placed in the thick of the battle (most of the characters are completely fictional \u2014 and the famous copy of order 191 is delivered to McClellan by Delancey who appears to have no basis in fact).  An example of Cornwell\u2019s fun: Starbuck is speaking with Potter: \u201cYou\u2019ve still got the whiskey?\u201d \u201cSafe in its stone bottle, wrapped in two shirts, a piece of canvas, and an unbound copy of Macaulay\u2019s Essays. It isn\u2019t a complete volume. I found it dangling in a Harper\u2019s Ferry privy and the first thirty pages had already been consumed for hygienic purposes.\u201d \u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather have found his poetry?\u201d Starbuck asked. \u201cIn a privy? No, I think not. Besides, I already have swathes of Macauley in my head, or what remains of my head,\u201d Potter said, touching the bloody bandage over his left ear. \u201c \u2018To every man upon this earth Death cometh soon or late, And how can man die better Than facing fearful odds.\u2019 \u201d Potter shook his head at the appropriateness of the words. \u201cToo good for a privy, Starbuck. My father hung the works of Roman Catholic theologians in our outhouse. It was, he said, the only thing they were fit for, but the insult misfired. I damn nearly converted to popery after reading Newman\u2019s lectures. Father thought I was constipated till he found out what I was doing, and after that we used newspapers like every other Christian, but father always made sure that any verses of scripture were cut out before the sheets were threaded on the string.\u201d In a historical note at the end, Cornwell references Landscape Turned Red: The Battle of Antietamby Stephen Sears as the best book on the battle, so I\u2019ve added that to my reading list which continues to grow beyond an unreasonable size."}, {"userName": "Ed", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1090620-ed", "userReview": "This is the last book in the Starbuck Civil War series, even though Cornwell hints that more will be coming. This covers the events leading up to and the battle of Antietam, the bloodiest day in U.S. military history.Starbuck takes over a punishment battalion made up of alleged cowards, deserters and other motley individuals. This after proving that the previous commander was a crook. Before they are really trained the battalion is marched off to join Lee's army. They take part in Stonewall Jackson's capture of Harper's Ferry, a Union stronghold. They then undergo a forced march to the town of Sharpsburg next to Antitam creek and learn the lessons that only combat can teach and do quite well in the process. As always Cornwell's battle scenes are riveting. His characters have matured since the first volume and his descriptions of their behavior are much more realistic. He does a great job of describing General McClelland and is aligned with the descriptions of the popinjay general that I've read in other books about the Civil War. Another thing I admire about Cornwell is how he integrates his research into his fiction. The discovery of Lee's plans by the Union, a real event, is interestingly developed in this story. I'm sorry I have no more Nate Starbuck adventures to anticipate reading."}, {"userName": "Christopher", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12306131-christopher", "userReview": "The final volume of Cornwell's Civil War series is a bit stronger than the middle two but still feels like less-than-solid Sharpe stories. Taking the better known battle of Antietam is a good start as it enables Cornwell to tell a broader story of the battle with more identifiable set-pieces. Getting there was a challenge as there's no real antagonist here. Starbuck's battles with his inept commander Washington Faulconer aren't that satisfying as Faulconer gets removed to Richmond and isn't really heard from. When Starbuck is given command of a battalion of rejects/stragglers (due to Faulconer), it had potential for some quality scenes where he whips them into shape, but it's more minor level staff officer backbiting and none of the foils for Starbuck are that challenging/memorable. The best little scenes are Cornwell's dealing with how McClellan came to possess Lee's General Order 191 detailing the Confederate troop placements prior to the battle. It's inventive and entertaining. But other than that, the characters here just aren't that memorable. You'd think Starbuck byt this volume have developed at least SOME sense of himself other than \"I just like soldierin'\" but it's not to be. We still have no idea why Starbuck is fighting for the South, neither does he and neither does Cornwell."}, {"userName": "Graham", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1760824-graham", "userReview": "THE BLOODY GROUND is the last in the Starbuck series so far, although the author insists there will be another at some point.

Lee took the initiative after a string of triumphs over the bungling Union army and launched an attack into the north, aiming to bloody the Federal army's nose in its own territory and provoke the people of the United States into pressing for peace-- for how many people would support a distant war against the south when the shells were falling in their own fields, with their own homes used as quarters for wounded soldiers? Despite a record of impressive incompetence, McClellan managed to intercept Lee's army on September 17th, resulting in the bloodiest day of combat in the entire war. McClellan didn't lose disastrously and that for him was a triumph...but the victory owed more to the Union officers who found Lee's battle orders wrapped around a few cigars not far from their lines -- and The Bloody Ground is the story of how they got there. The likely end of the Starbuck chronicles, Bloody Ground is wet with death both triumphant and tragic.'Til now, every battle involving Nathaniel Starbuck -- who chased a girl into Virginia right as the war erupted and decided to fight for the south to anger his abolitionist father -- has been a victory for the Confederacy, largely thanks to McMilquetoast, with some assistance from the stunning heroics of Starbuck's company. Here the streak ends, though the Union victory owes more to the actions of secondary characters, especially Starbuck's counterpart -- his best friend Adam, who despite being the son of a southern aristocrat, fights for the north, and here becomes involved in the murky world of intelligence. Adam is a tragic character, far more sympathetic than Starbuck but so earnest that Cornwell prefers to punish him instead of reward him; rewards are for scoundrels and brigands in Cornwell's world. But perhaps the scoundrels deserve the rewards more: Starbuck, after all, has to cope with being Enemy #1 to Washington Falcouner, who has seen fit to \"promote\" him to the leader of a punishment battalion known encouragingly as \"The Yellowlegs\".The Bloody Ground's intensity is fitting for the bloodiest day of the war, though combat takes a backseat to the espionage threads; there are spies everywhere, including a man pretending to be a southron in Starbuck's ranks to avoid capture as a Union raider who, Iago-like, starts turning his company against him. Considering that Starbuck's company will be present in some of the battle's bloodiest moments -- the skirmish in the cornfield and the orgy of death that was the Sunken Road -- you'd think his life is in peril enough from the Union army, without adding murderous subordinates into the mix. Starbuck is at his most likable in The Bloody Ground, though; while his motives for fighting may have been petty, he is admirably devoted to his comrades-in-arms, especially those scorned by officers, and a protector of underdogs. (\"I am Starbuck, defender of whores!\")Quite a fun read, but the ending is rather distressing. The bloodletting doesn't stop with minor characters, and I'll leave it at that. It seems a shame this series has been discontinued, but if Cornwell had to choose between Starbuck and Sharpe, I'm glad he chose Sharpe. Speaking of whom, I think I left him about to invade France..."}, {"userName": "adam-p-reviews", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8491698-adam-p-reviews", "userReview": "The Bloody Ground is the forth and at the moment last book in Bernard Cornwell\u2019s Starbuck Chronicles. There are rumours that Cornwell will be adding to this series after a sixteen year break! I wish he would get back to Nate\u2019s story because I love this series.This novel picks up after Battle Flag as the Confederate army fights off the last Northern attack and finally goes on the offence and invades the North itself. The mastermind behind this plan is Robert Lee and for his plan to work he will need the best soldiers in the Confederate army, soldiers like Nathanial \u2018Nate\u2019 Starbuck. However instead of playing a key role in the leadership of the army, Nate\u2019s enemies conspire against him and place him in the control of a \u2018punishment\u2019 Battalion. Hoping that with this Battalion\u2019s poor record of routing, Nate will never become the great officer he is destined to be. But Nate turns his Battalion into a well-trained unit and is rewarded for his hard work by been given the command of the attack on the Northern Garrison at Harper\u2019s Ferry. After his victory over the garrison, Nate and his Battalion then go onto Antietam Creek where the bloodiest battle ever fought in America pushes Nate to the limit. Meanwhile a conspiracy is happening at the heart of the Confederate army. One of Nate\u2019s best friends Adam Falconer is trying to lead Lee\u2019s army into a trap, to try and re-unite both the North and the South and stop the bloodshed spilt between American and American.This book was brilliant and I can\u2019t believe that Cornwell has left the series with this novel and hasn\u2019t as yet written the next book. I suppose you could argue that during those sixteen years he has written some truly excellent books such as The Warlord Trilogy, The Grail Quest and The Saxon Stories as well as writing many new Sharpe books, so maybe hasn\u2019t had time to get back to them. Nevertheless the four he has written were all brilliant and the thing I like the most about these books is that throughout the novels we get to see Nate grow from a boy into a man. As I have said in my earlier reviews, Cornwell\u2019s technique of making a character who would not normally become a hero into a hero is most apparent in these novels. I think this is because they are set over such a small space of time. During that time Nate is put through some of the bloodiest battles in history, forcing him to become a leader of men (because so many officers were killed) and eventually become a hero. I do hope Conwell adds to these novels, it would be great to see where Nate\u2019s path takes him after the Battle of Antietam.Brilliant book, brilliant series but please Bernard do write some more of these books! Anyone who is a Cornwell fan will love this series. Also if you are interested in the Civil War period I think you would really like these books as Cornwell really brings the facts to life and portrays the horror of the battles in what some people call the first modern war.For more great reviews check out http://adam-p-reviews.blogspot.co.uk/"}, {"userName": "Iceman", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15824497-iceman", "userReview": "Neste 4\u00ba volume das Cr\u00f3nicas de Starbuck, Bernard Cornwell continua na senda de Nathaniel Starbuck, jovem nortista que combate na guerra civil americana pelo lado dos rebeldes.E, quanto a mim, \u00e9 o livro mais brutal dos quatro.As perip\u00e9cias de Nate levam-no ao comando de um batalh\u00e3o denominado \u201cpernas amarelas\u201d, nome pejorativo que simboliza a cobardia demonstrada por esse batalh\u00e3o numa batalha anterior.

The book continues as with the previous books with Nate Starbuck now a Major in the southern army. Nate was getting along well enough in the Faulkner Legion when he gets reassigned to a \"punishment\" battalion called the \"yellow legs.\" They acquired this name because as one character put it, \"they all pissed their pants at one time creating a new swamp.\" In other words, these men were cowards and they were being punished for it. Nate has no time to make this ragtag command into a fighting unit when he gets orders to march to battle.The account of the Battle of Antietam is well done as the battle scenes in previous novels in the series. Perhaps a slight difference in this book is Nate's reluctance and fear of going back into battle. He knows how horrific battle can be and also knows that chances of survival on the front lines are not particularly good. There is one scene where Nate and Colonel Swinyard discuss which would be worse: being shot by a random bullet or one that was purposely aimed. In the end, if the bullet killed them quickly, it didn't really matter. Nate has enemies in his new command and must watch his back as much as the forward march to engage Yankee soldiers.The book is well written. My biggest complaint however is that it seems unfinished. The Battle of Antietam is the last book in the Nate Starbuck series. The book ends with no resolution of the characters and the promise that Nate would fight again. I think there was another book planned but never materialized. And that is a disappointment.

Cornwell has studied the battle in some detail. It has been studied and written about by several scholars (Cornwell cites Landscape Turned Red by Stephen Sears) and Cornwell has been able to convert the historical account into a fast paced narrative.

He could have completely routed Lee's forces, blocked his retreat, captured many troops and in all likelihood, brought the war to a much earlier conclusion. Instead, misled by the reports of his Pinkerton agents (which exaggerated Lee's troops strength as double what it was when, in fact, McClellan had Lee outnumbered at least 3 to 1), he waited a couple miles from the slaughter, declining to order his main forces into battle.

There isn't much personal interaction in this one. Starbuck and the battle itself are the stars of this one.The Bloody Ground wasn't supposed to be the end of the series and there is no conclusion.

Otherwise, the writing is mediocre and the character of Starbuck just sorts of stutters and does nothing.Antietam was and remains the bloodiest single day in US military history, with something like 23,000 casualties. It was a terrible battle, with both armies exchanging possession of one single patch of ground, the cornfield, something like 80 times. The sunken road was a slaughterhouse for both sides as well.Cornwell does great justice to this battle, and his fictionalized characterization of George McClellan, the completely incompetent commander of the Union forces, is excellent.

The author's, not surprisingly, depiction of the battle is excellent and makes the reader marvel at the incredible bravery of the soldiers. Starbuck, while brave and competent, is not a particularly sympathetic fellow. As he notes, he is soldier of the South by chance and has no other commitment to the cause other than he likes soldiering.

By the way, I have discovered that anything by Cornwell is highly likely to be a worthwhile read."}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1217167-mike", "userReview": "**** 1/2Great four-book fictional series about a Northerner who fights for the Confederacy. This stuff is classic Bernard Cornwell; interesting characters, meticulous research and pulse-pounding battle scenes that take you directly to the mayhem. While I already knew quite a bit about the American Civil War, reading this series makes me want to learn more. Cornwell gives readers a great sense for the brutality and futility of war thatat the same time, is fascinating. Ultimately, whether you were a Johnny Reb or a Billy Federal, you were equally cannon fodder. The ACW is one of America's greatest tragedies, and you get that sense from the Nate Starbuck series. Cornwell is the best historical fiction author I've yet come across."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26243910-paul", "userReview": "I have thoroughly enjoyed all of the books in this series and was very pleased to read at the end of the end of the historical note that \"Starbuck will ride again\". I do hope so but there has been quite a gap since Bernard Cornwell finished this book. As ever, the author's intimate knowledge of the history and clever weaving of known facts into the fictional narrative really brings the story to life. Yes there is a degree of predictability to the plot but the writing is so engrossing that one can't help but get caught up in the tale as it gallops along at a good pace. As ever with Bernard Cornwell, a compelling page turner and as I said at the start - I do hope he returns his focus back to this era - I do so want to know how Nate Starbuck gets on."}, {"userName": "Torben", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3395025-torben", "userReview": "Ein typischer Cornwell, aber dann unterschiedlich zu den anderen Serien. Die einzelnen Hauptpersonen k\u00e4mpfen an den unterschiedlichen Fronten und Seiten. Wer ist loyal zu wem, wem kann man den R\u00fccken zuwenden, was sind die Ideale und was ist richtig? Gerade in einem B\u00fcrgerkrieg noch schwerer zu beantworten. Leider ist dieser vierte Band vorerst der letzte der Reihe. Dabei ist soviel der Krieg aber vor allem sind die Beweggr\u00fcnde der Figuren und deren Lebenswege noch nicht auserz\u00e4hlt. Hoffe, dass Cornwell zu Starbucks zur\u00fcckkehrt. \u00dcber Cornwells Schreibkunst und Beschreibungen muss man nichts mehr sagen. Die Schlacht am Antietam ist gut nachvollziehbar und zeigt den ganzen Unsinn eines Krieges."}, {"userName": "Doug", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4763780-doug", "userReview": "What can you say? This is another great effort by Bernard Cornwell. As soon as you figured out that the book was about the Battle of Antietam, you pretty much knew how it is going to turn out - but it remained a page turner none-the-less. I don't know how you do justice to describing the butchery that accounted for the deaths of 23,000 men in a single day, but I suspect that Mr. Cornwell has done it about as well as it can be done. The door was left wide open for a fifth book in the series and I hope he chooses to write it since there are a number of loose ends that I would like to see tied up."}, {"userName": "Graham", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9006020-graham", "userReview": "I enjoyed this book for all the same reasons that I enjoy other Cornwell books. Fast paced and exciting, with enough historical basis to make me feel like I'm learning something. This one was even better since i had just visited Anteitam and could look forward to descriptions of places and events that i knew a little about. The story from the point of view of a confederate soldier is challenging. I read the battles while taking the side of the confederate army and that felt a little awkward. But, maybe that is good for me. I will continue to read his books."}], "description": "Battle of Antietam, 1862 In this fourth, final, and rousing installment of Nathaniel Starbuck's Civil War adventures, Nate is given command of a punishment battalion: a motley collection of cowards, thieves, deserters, and murderers. Setting off to Join General Robert E. Lee's army, Starbuck's men reach Harper's Ferry in time to take part in Stonewall Jackson's capture of the Union garrison. From there, the regiment moves on to the legendary horror of Sharpsburg, beside the Antietam Creek, forever to be remembered as the bloodiest single day of the war.
