So his grandfather packs up Jack and his sister Lula and is taking them to an aunt to live. Things never turn out that easy though and Grandpa is murdered (not a spoiler) and Lula is taken by a gang of bad guys.\nJack is on a mission to get his sister back and enlists several helpmates for his quest; Eustace, a grave-digging black skinned man who must stay away from alcohol.\nEustace's somewhat pet, Hog. (Don't laugh, Hog kicks some major ass)\nShorty, an educated little man, with a hair trigger temperament.\nJack wants to be able to get back the sister that was taken by the bad men and no matter how many times his companions point out that he may not be getting the same sister back, he stills wants to believe in a higher power and that good will win over bad.It was as if I had gone to visit Lot in Sodom and Gomorrah and had encountered the men who wanted to bugger the angels. I had decided I had no choice but to go on with things, but I will tell you quite sincerely that my guts ached and I felt as if Jesus had laid a disapproving hand on my shoulder. In fact, its warm presence was with me for awhile, until later in the day I discovered I had been messed on by a bird.Jack's entourage continues to grow as they make their way to the bad guys hideout located in the woods called the Big Thicket. Jack picks up a local whore who decides she is done with whoring\n and she causes him to start thinking that life may not be as a black and white as he was brought up to believe.Even though I could guess the way this book was going to wrap up it still has that special Lansdale touch as so much that I'm going to give it the full five stars. I did think the story was slow in the beginning but then it made me start loving these characters. A coming of age tale with lots of cussing and a shit ton of violence and it made me almost pee myself laughing? What else could I do but five star it?Warning: This book is totally not politically correct. I won a copy of this book from First reads. Yes, I know it was years ago. I lost the damn thing and found it recently. It does not effect my review at all. I became Lansdale fangirl after I won it. \nI participated in a buddy read with Dan 2.0 on this one. He will probably give the book a one star and I will have to send a small person with an attitude to get him to change his rating. He will also probably write a thought out review where as I just use pretty pictures.

On the way to hunt down the criminals, jack repeatedly states that he does not want the men killed; he just wants his sister back, and he knows that this does not have to end in bloodshed. his fellow-companions have seen a bit more of the world's workings, and treat him like a curiosity, begrudgingly respecting his idealism, but knowing how this is all going to end.\"You are so definite, kid. Seldom right, but always certain.\"along the way, encounter after encounter shows jack that the world doesn't play by \"love thy neighbor\" rules and might not recognize good intentions and turning of cheek. he learns from his new friends, and hears their life's philosophies in the quiet hours:Life isn't just black or white, here or there; it's got some mud in it, and we're some of the mud.andJust a year ago I kept thinking this ain't fair, the way things have turned out for me. Then it come to me clean as spring rain. Life is just what it is, and it ain't fair at all.\"and through all the bloodshed and frustration that things are not turning out as he had planned, jack hardens a little with every page, adapting his own morality to take in the realities he is discovering at every turn, but resentful of the world's cruelty.I wished then that I was wasn't a man at all but a hawk, something with some kind of integrity about what it killed, that did it for food or survival, not for sport or revenge or to satisfy something rotten inside.it is a very bloody book. and also a very funny book. and the lessons are hard-won, and all the plucky little folksyisms are worn down to hard little nubs by the end of jack's moral awakening. and it earns all of it. i really liked this book, and it has re-ignited my interest in lansdale. a definite should-read for most of you..."}, {"userName": "Dan Schwent", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/870755-dan-schwent", "userReview": "When his grandfather is murdered and his sister kidnapped by outlaws, young Jack Parker goes looking for vengeance. With a four gauge wielding man named Eustace, a midget sharpshooter named Shorty, and a hog named Hog, he goes hunting for Cutthroat Bill and his gang. Will he survive long enough to find his sister?I got this ARC from Netgalley. Thank you, Netgalley! Although it only took two damn months for my request to get approved...Here we are, the 36th Joe Lansdale book I've read. The Thicket is part True Grit, part coming of age tale, and all Joe Lansdale.The plot of The Thicket is simple enough. It's a tale of a young man's coming of age and quest for vengeance. In the wake of his parents' death from the pox, Jack and his sister Lula are traveling with their grandfather until they run afoul of some outlaws. Jack survives and meets up with Shorty and Eustace and the tale kicks into high gear.The usual Lansdale mojo is in full effect. The dialogue is a kind of redneck poetry of profanity and clever similes. Lansdale's ear for dialogue always surprises me. I could easily hear the same dialogue coming out of people down at the local Wal-Mart. And the violence, oh, the violence. There's a steady stream of violence, dolled out like appetizers, until the main course, the bloody shootout at the end.The characters Jack meets on his adventure are a colorful bunch, from Eustace, the man of mixed blood that wields a damn cannon, to Shorty, the educated little man who is a crack shot, the scarred sheriff Winton, to Jimmie, the whore with a heart of something resembling gold that teaches Jack a few tricks, both in and out of the bedroom.Since it's a Lansdale book, no one gets out unscathed. The gunfights didn't feel like Hollywood gunfights at all, more chaos than anything else. The entire cast was changed, either by the carnage or by becoming dead.Lansdale is one of the authors I feel like I would get along with based on his writing. Where George Pelecanos and I would probably spent time discussing music, I could see myself bullshitting with Uncle Joe on my back porch with a couple beers and some BBQ on the grill.That's about all I have to say. It's one of the better Lansdale books in recent memory so just read the damn thing!"}, {"userName": "Kemper", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper", "userReview": "(I received a free copy of this from NetGalley.)At the tail end of the cowboy days in East Texas, sixteen year old Jack Parker and his sister Lula have a helluva bad week. After their parents die in a smallpox epidemic, their grandfather is murdered by a gang of bank robbers who kidnap Lula. The only help that Jack can find is a grave digging black man named Eustace and the tiny bounty hunter Shorty. Along with a giant hog, they set out to rescue Lula. Jack tries to hold to his Christian beliefs that the gang should be caught and tried, and he is horrified at Shorty and Eustace\u2019s willingness to kill and ignore common decency in the name of a greater good, namely their own. As they meet more victims of the gang along the trail and see how cruel they truly are, Jack starts to realize that there\u2019s no way to get Lula back without getting blood on his hands and that his traveling companions may have a better understanding of the world than he does. His young puritan ways are also tested when he meets Jimmie Sue, a hooker with a heart of gold who takes a liking to him.There are elements of this story that will probably sound familiar to anyone who has read or seen one of the two film versions of True Grit with a young person venturing into a hostile wilderness with some salty frontier types, but Lansdale also adds some bizarre and violent turns that feel more like Django Unchained at times.My favorite part was the character of Shorty. He may be the smallest member of the posse, but he\u2019s the smartest and hell on wheels with a gun in his hand. He\u2019s also a misanthrope who came by it honestly after a lifetime of dealing with people who treat him like a freak or a child, and he gets most of the best lines in the book.It\u2019s also got all the hallmarks of Joe Lansdale with a profane sense of humor that provides plenty of action but with a sense of responsibility about the damage done by all the violence. In fact, my one complaint about the novel is that it\u2019s a little too Joe Lansdale.If you\u2019ve read his Hap & Leonard series, then a lot of this will seem somewhat familiar in that you\u2019ve got some characters who while being \u2018the good guys\u2019 are perfectly content to dish out punishment if they feel it\u2019s been earned while someone provides a softer hearted conscience that urges some compassion. In fact, this isn\u2019t even the first Lansdale book to feature a little person involved in a vicious pistol whipping along with a strange wild animal bonding with people since he worked similar stuff into Rumble Tumble.However, if the worst thing I can say about it is that it\u2019s a typical Joe Lansdale story, then you know you\u2019re still getting an entertaining tale.Also posted at Kemper's Book Blog."}, {"userName": "Kelly (and the Book Boar)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11183856-kelly-and-the-book-boar", "userReview": "Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/My Goodreads\u2019 buddies have been trying to get me to read The Thicket since before it even came out (because an ARC was available for request), but I resisted because . . . . . \nWell, partially.

Lansdale pretty much guarantees a good time. The fact that the first sentence contains the words \"gun-shooting dwarf\"...that's just icing on the cake.Jack Parker is a fine, upstanding teenager who dislikes violence, yet soon he will be hiring two brutal men to find the villains who've killed his grandfather and stolen his sister.Morally upright kids in a sudden quest for vengeance may seem a familiar theme (Yeah, yeah, I read True Grit, too), but believe me - you've never read it the way Lansdale writes it.I felt in that moment as if I had come unstuck from life and that I was somewhere outside of the real world, in some insane place where common decency and the laws of men were just silly things, like lace pants on a donkey. My eyes turned wet. My bowels went loose. I didn't know if I should move or stay still, and was uncertain I could do either.The two hired men are Shorty, the aforementioned \"gun-shooting dwarf,\" and his pal Eustace, a tracker. Reminiscent of Lansdale's Hap and Leonard, they deliver some great dialogue, not to mention righteous beatings to all who require them. Throw in a pet boar with a mind of his own, a hooker with a sense of humor, and a few more misfits, and you've got yourself a great cast of characters headed for certain doom.\"Fatty said the rest of them, with your sister, are heading over into the main of the Big Thicket. Over there beyond Livingston, down in the brambles and the high-ass pines. It's a bad lands there, down in them deep dark woods. There's lots of colored who have run off there to trap and live, and there's lots of outlaws, too. I know some colored that left here to go there, and I ain't never seen them since. Law don't like to go in there, cause lot of time they do, they don't come back. That's where we got to go if you want your sister back, and there ain't nothing else for it.\"If that paragraph is not warning enough, now might be the time to tell anyone unfamiliar with Lansdale's style that the man is not shy about visiting dark places. One minute, you will be laughing at someone's clever quip, but the very next sentence may leave you flinching at the nasty, violent turn that things have taken. There is a high body count, and bad things happen to all manner of animals.That's not to say there is no humor in this book. I particularly enjoyed the banter between Shorty and Eustace.Eustace smiled, he reached out and touched Shorty on his hatted head like he was a little boy. \"I get killed, you can have any of my dung you find along the way while you're following. I wanted you to know that.\"\"You may proceed to diddle yourself,\" Shorty said.If you like a great adventure, plenty of action, and don't mind a little blood-shed, this is a fantastic read, and quite simply, one of Lansdale's best."}, {"userName": "\u018a\u1eaf\u0273  2.\u260a", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12058788-2", "userReview": "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u00bdAround the turn of the 20th century much of America may be on the cusp of civilization, but East Texas is still a wild, feral, and ever dangerous place\u2014which Jack Parker\u2019s about to learn the hard way. Our story opens to a smallpox epidemic sweeping through town, leaving sixteen-year-old Jack and his sister, Lula, orphaned. After burying the bodies, and torching the house, their grandpa packs \u2018em into the wagon, and they all head north to their aunt\u2019s farm up in Kansas. It\u2019s not long in their travels, before they\u2019re accosted by some bad men on a ferry, and that\u2019s when the real story begins. *Minor spoilers below.*After an argument grows heated, Cut Throat Bill and his gang of outlaws murder Jack\u2019s grandpa, and kidnap Lula. Fate intervenes to prevent Jack\u2019s tale from ending right then and there, but he\u2019s by no means capable of rescuing Lula from a group of hardened thugs. He aims to garner the help of the local sheriff, only to discover him murdered by the same gang. The cowardly deputy is hightailing it outta town, but fortune shines down on the lad once again, when he chances upon a large colored man and his big ole hog.Eustace ain\u2019t just a grave digger; he\u2019s also a part-time bounty hunter and tracker. He agrees to assist young Jack, as long as his partner, a midget named Shorty, is willing to tag along for the ride. Shorty, the real brains of the outfit, is more than willing to put in a little work for the steep reward Jack\u2019s offering up. This ain\u2019t exactly the type of posse our boy was hoping to round up, but time\u2019s a wasting. No tellin\u2019 what horrors have already been exacted upon his poor sis, so beggars can\u2019t be too choosey.This book was a hoot, in some ways it felt like a last adventure to close out those wild times. Unlike the original Dan, I haven\u2019t read the entirety of Lansdale\u2019s work, but of the four I have read so far, this one is hands down my favorite. And one I would highly recommend. As the cover blurb mentions, it\u2019s equal parts True Grit and Stand by Me, with a colorful cast of lively characters who play well off of each other. If you\u2019ve read any Hap and Leonard, then you know what you\u2019re in for with Shorty and Eustace.The story itself isn\u2019t all that original; it\u2019s essentially a coming of age tale, where Jack is confronted with the harsh realities of the real world, and put to some tough moral dilemmas. His virtuous nature is stretched thin by his world weary companions. But it\u2019s those comedic flourishes that really elevate the story, and add a great deal to the overall adventure. Even the gunfights, instead of being an intense life and death affair, are usually more a comedy of errors. While I greatly enjoyed myself, I\u2019m still hesitant to hand out a full 5 stars. Not only because I\u2019m a bastard, but for three minor quibbles. One, the writing felt a bit clunky at times, but that may have been intentional, due to the fact that Jack is the one telling the tale. Two, they built up the actual Thicket itself to be this backwoods death trap, but it never quite lived up to the hype\u2014I was expecting, at minimum, an attempted bushwhack or two. Three, Lansdale chose to tack on a mini obit for most of the characters, within the last few pages of what, up to that point, had been a day in the life type of adventure\u2014I prefer it when my heroes can live on in my imagination. I could forgive one, maybe two of those transgressions, but not all three. 4.5 stars. Falls just short of GR\u2019s \u201cit was amazing\u201d rating, but well within that goldilocks zone\u2122, and I reserve the right to round up. ;)Impromptu buddy read with the Monkey Queen."}, {"userName": "Char", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6581119-char", "userReview": "4.5 stars!This book was wonderful!Granted, it had some very nasty language and racial epithets, but these rang true for the time period.

On to the good stuff-the characters. This book is populated with such a colorful cast, all of whom I can see in my mind clear as day. The bad guys were as clearly drawn and hated as the good guys were vivid and loved. I wanted to hug all the folks on the good side and that includes Hog. The narrator, Will Collyer, was absolutely fantastic. His voices were wonderful and it was easy to tell which character was which. He gave them character, and somehow added a touch of reality to them, as well as a level of depth. Or maybe that was Mr. Lansdale that did that. Or maybe it was the combination of them both. Either way, this book was great. The audio was wonderful, the characters truly memorable, and I find myself hoping that I can find another book authored by and narrated by these same guys.

Lansdale in peak form.The book is set in East Texas, early in the Twentieth century, just as the oil boom is reaching that area. Sadly, a smallpox epidemic has swept through the region, and sixteen-year-old Jack Parker and his fourteen-year-old sister, Lula have lost their parents to the disease. In the company of their grandfather, the children are leaving Texas to live with a relative in Kansas. But the journey has barely begun when a group of savage bank-robbing outlaws kills the grandfather and abducts Lula. Jack runs to the law, but the sheriff has been murdered; the deputy has been frightened into resigning, and so Jack his left to his own devices if he is to rescue his sister.He teams up with a group of accomplices that only the mind of Joe R. Lansdale could conceive. They include a bounty-hunting midget, an alcoholic grave digger who keeps a feral pig as a pet, and Jimmie Sue, a prostitute who winds up sweet on young Jack. The villains they are pursuing are as dark and amoral as anyone could imagine, and Jack is constantly reminded by his new-found friends that even if they do recover Lula, she will doubtless have been very ill-used in the meantime. To say that the author has created a number of memorable characters here would be the understatement of the year.The manhunt takes a number of twists and turns, and the story, which is vaguely reminiscent of True Grit, rolls along without the slightest boring moment to a smashing climax.

Lansdale's latest novels seem to all feature recently orphaned kids being chased by, or chasing, someone. It seems like the last few novels may have been rough drafts for this almost perfect turn-of-the-century tale that bears more than a little resemblance to True Grit. Having left their pox-plague East Texas town with their grandfather, brother and sister Jack and Lulu Parker come across baddie CutThrioat Pete and company who kill their grandfather and kidnap Lulu. Jack is left to rescue his sister and this is where the good stuff starts. The basically moral Jack is forced to ally with a midget, a son of a slave and a semi-wild hog, all seeming to have different ideas of morality than Jack. This idea of relative morality and \"living in the real world\" is prevalent throughout this novel and is what puts it above most thriller novels. Yet Lansdale populates his story with people who are not one-dimensional and seem to be always thinking about their plight. Even though there is the usual amount of action and violence you would expect from Lansdale, I say there might be more dialogue than usual in his tale, especially from Shorty, an educated gun-toting midget. He is the catalyst for the novel, presenting the fact and putting them in perspective but not always the way Jack would prefer. This is easily one of Lansdale's best novels.(edit) I hear that The Thicket is being made into a movie with the character of Shorty being played by Peter Dinklage.

This is the first book I've read by the prolific Joe R. Lansdale, and in the vein of the classic True Grit, it's both a very enjoyable Western adventure and a great coming of age story. Is most of Lansdale's work like this? If so, I've got some more reading to do!There are many other stories similar to the one you'll read in The Thicket. But Lansdale's easy writing really elevates it. He fills his story with an irresistible cast of well-drawn characters. I love how Jack doesn't a gather a bunch of hard, badass, Rooster Cogburn-types, but recruits a posse that many look at as being outcasts and a group that seem like they would fail from the outset. But as the story continues, you see that the group's heart and determination is what makes them extraordinary, and you can't help but root for them. And it's Jack himself that really gives the story it's heart and holds it together. It's a true coming of age tale, where we see that in this journey into the heart of darkness, he struggles with his values and beliefs as he realizes that he has to get down and dirty to save his little sis, even at the expense of his soul. \n\nTo some extent I find sin like coffee. When I was young and had my first taste of it I found it bitter and nasty, but later on I learned to like it by putting a little milk in it, and then I learned to like it black. Sin is like that.

Rather, he turns his pain and sufferance into determination, embarking of a quest for vengeance and to return his sister to safety. Set in the early 1900\u2019s, THE THICKET is near perfect contemporary fiction. The sense of time and place is enveloping, the characters and their mannerisms wholly period-centric. Transporting to the reader to a dangerous time in American history, Lansdale also manages to capture the hearts and imagination of the reader.The young protagonist, Jack Parker, assembles a rough and ready band of misfits to track his sisters\u2019 kidnappers. Spilling blood in the wake of an escape, one of the kidnappers\u2019 leaves a bloody trail of menace which only serves to spur Jack on despite being seemingly unfit for such a violent confrontation. There is so much to like about THE THICKET but I\u2019ll refrain for saying too much as to not spoil the plot and the formulation of Jack\u2019s search party. Many of the characters will stay with you long after you've finished the book; Eustace and Shorty, as an example, are two of the most memorable fictional characters I\u2019ve had the pleasure of reading, yet they are a mere sample of the quality of cast Lansdale as crafted for this novel.

I've read most of Lansdale's other books and liked them very much. I finally got around to reading this extraordinary example of \"Texas Noir\" to my great enjoyment in an otherwise long and depressing New England winter. Joe R Lansdale consistently does for East Texas what Don Winslow does for Southern California which is to say, he recreates the life and times of a place in a totally unique, brilliant and entertaining way. Young Jack Parker looses both parents to an epidemic, buries them, then watches his grandfather get murdered and his sister Lula kidnapped on a ferry crossing the Sabine River in early 20th century East Texas. Thus begins his quest to save her from a psychotic gang of murdering thugs led by Cut Throat Bill. Jack enlists the help of an eclectic collection of originally drawn characters you won't find in fiction - period. There's Shorty: a charismatic and self educated dwarf, Eustice: a black/Indian with a drinking problem, a fat hog and a bounty hunting sheriff named Winton. Jimmie Sue, a young prostitute enamored by Jack, retires from the profession to join him and his new associates looking for Lula and a better life. This is a fast paced \"True Grit\" kind of a coming of age tale that's both very dark and very light with bold humor, heart and soul. Their odyssey tests their courage and humanity in an unforgettable journey into the darkness of Cut Throat Bill and his gang hiding in \"The Thicket\". I'd rate this book a GR 10 stars if it was available. It's that good!...............Ed"}, {"userName": "J.K.

They pretty much keep it to themselves and consider it your business, as long as the women are not theirs. Or the sheep. ShortyI really enjoyed The Bottoms and figured this would be in the same vein. The setting was similar, Texas in the early 1900's but TB had a bit of a supernatural/folklore vibe this was more a coming of age story with dark humor.Jack and his younger sister Lula, have just lost their parents to a pox epidemic and their grandfather decides to take them(unannounced)to live with an aunt. As they take the ferry across the river their grandfather gets into a dispute with one of the group of riders who joined the ride and as the incident escalates the ferry is overturned by a water spout. Jack ends up on one side of the river, his grandfather is nowhere to be seen(presumed drowned) and his sister ends up on the other side of the river with the other riders, who carry her off against her will.As Jack sets off to inform the law and form a posse we are introduced to quite the cast of characters. Shorty, a \"gun shooting dwarf\", Eustace, a half-breed, crappy tracker and a 600 pound black hog named, well, Hog. The interplay between these four was a joy to read. As they track down Cut Throat Bill and his gang, they add several more members to their posse, Jimmie Sue, a prostitute that Jack loses his virginity to; Spot, a black man trying to collect a 5 dollar reward for information and Winton, a sheriff and former bounty hunter.Not really what I was expecting but still a very enjoyable book and aren't those unexpected gems the best kind?A bullet come past me like it had to meet someone downtown and was late, and gave me a hot kiss on the ear as it passed."}, {"userName": "Lou", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3699303-lou", "userReview": "A brother, sister, and grandpa try to make a safe journey away from a deadly insidious smallpox.Scenes of fighting and shooting within this tale, men on horses, set in a time of the horse and cart, bandits, gunfighters and kidnappers.There be some dust to dust,bullet and lust,and devilry along the way,in delivery of vengeance and salvation.Bad guys have in the wings, on the road, in pursuit of them, a motley crew in search of some good old justice and material gain.The Parkers are made of tuff stock and desperate times put one boy through the hardest times of his life, he traverses through a period of coming of age on this road.There be a first for many a thing for him, in this darn good cinematic True Grit by Charles Portis like tale.Lonsdale writing with great dialogue, memorable characters, great similes, thee picturesque, and great scenes of action.He is a darn good storyteller, his writing flows with qualities that keep you hooked in the narrative till the end, a Texas noir master.\u00a0Read Interview with Joe R.

Lansdale, and while it wasn't among the best western books I've read, it was enticing enough to further explore his other novels. When Jack Parker witnesses his grandfather die and his sister taken at the hands of a vicious gang of outlaws, he assembles an eccentric cast of roughnecks to give chase to rescue his sister and avenge his grandpa. While Jack isn't the most extraordinary of protagonists, he suits the novel fair enough as the inexperienced youth trying to find his way. The pack he assembles, from an African American grave digger named Eustace and his pet hog to a philosophical dwarf ironically named Shorty, becomes the main appeal of the novel. It's much like True Grit, unoriginal but satisfying enough, mostly due to the backstories and personalities of the people who surround Jack. Unfortunately the villains receive little to no depth nor exposure, and the plot stalls and retraces it's steps giving a feeling of walking around in circles in order to move itself forward. Some characters, like Eustace and Shorty, are better written and well-rounded than many of the others, but nonetheless this was a sustainable western that was intriguing enough to explore other works by Lansdale."}, {"userName": "Lee Dunning", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5084502-lee-dunning", "userReview": "Pretty much anything I say will fall short.

It seemed to have a lot of the pleasures of reading from when I was a kid. Does it have a slightly Boys-Own-Adventure-feel about it? An old-fashioned adventure yarn?Maybe not. But it does shoot ahead like a train, and it has a gallery of cool mistreated misfits as heroes, and snickering sadistic villains as baddies. It\u2019s fun, fun, fun!The storytelling is what you\u2019ve got to really admire. If you define good storytelling as the ability to completely hold someone\u2019s attention for the period of a journey. Lansdale is like a fair-ground huckster. You feel he\u2019s watching you closely, if he senses you\u2019re losing interest, he\u2019s going to throw in something to keep your attention; another character, some explosions, some uncomplicated violence. It hardly matters what it is. This is a pleasure ride, that\u2019s what it is. He\u2019s creating something interesting. He wants your attention. That\u2019s not to say that he simply creates a progressively more hysterical and more tedious show of bright lights and loud noises (although spectacle is important). He has quiet moments. He builds characters and relationships, but the forward momentum is irresistible.The interactions between characters are great. He\u2019s really good at pairs (men/women, men/men) who have that loving, but bitchy and needling married couple vibe.Sometimes you feel he\u2019s playing the comedy at the expense of character, but that\u2019s okay.One thing, and this is just a little thing, but there\u2019s a character called Shorty who\u2019s a midget. He\u2019s also something like a Cormac McCarthyian Ubermensch. He\u2019s super-clever, he\u2019s a super-shot, etc. The problem is that I felt this character wasn\u2019t properly exploited. More accurately, I felt his weakness wasn\u2019t exploited. I didn\u2019t really get a strong sense of how his height limited him. So I didn\u2019t get a strong sense of how he overcame it. Not really. In Breaking Bad, one of the pleasures of the story is the way that Walter White uses his intelligence to overcome his weaknesses. In Game of Thrones (the TV show as opposed to the book) we\u2019re interested in how Tyrion Lannister uses his cunning to overcome his weaknesses. I just felt that Shorty would have been a more compelling character if he had been more vulnerable.But, a super-fun read!"}, {"userName": "Rayna", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12459424-rayna", "userReview": "While reading Joe Lansdale's novel, \"The Thicket,\" this reader experienced an enormous range of emotions.

This talent is elevated by the fact that most of the time these highly identifiable characters are in completely, \"over the top,\" scenarios that for some reason this female thirty something mid-western reader can relate too. While reading, \"The Thicket,\" I felt like part of this misfit gang of stragglers determined by reasons like love, land, vengeance, or \"five dollars\" to save the lovely Lula from her captors. I felt like I was there sitting with Shorty, the midget, listening to him wax poetic by the campfire about love, god, and ethics. I felt like I was there snuggled up by Hog, the hog, trying to sleep while overheating and uncomfortable with such a foul yet lovable bunkmate. I felt like I was there with Winton, the mutilated bounty hunter... turned sheriff... turned bounty hunter again, charging over that hill with guns in both hands looking to make right what once went wrong.

Ma questo possibile handicap si rivela alla prova dei fatti un vantaggio, perch\u00e9 gli ultimi episodi incentrati sui due simpatici mattacchioni cominciavano a dimostrarsi piuttosto prevedibili e costruiti su un canovaccio ripetitivo, in assenza del quale Lansdale si muove con maggior autonomia, libero di procedere guidato dalla propria fantasia e svincolato da ruoli prestabiliti.A dire il vero, i dialoghi stralunati fra Shorty ed Eustace riecheggiano, anche nella dicotomia bianco/nero, i caratteri dei loro illustri predecessori, ma la presenza di una voce narrante esterna al duo e la coralit\u00e0 dei personaggi via via coinvolti in questo demenziale inseguimento nei luoghi pi\u00f9 inospitali del Texas orientale, portano la trama su strade pi\u00f9 originali e inaspettate.Contribuiscono all\u2019atmosfera del romanzo i dialoghi cazzeggianti in puro stile tarantiniano, l\u2019interporsi di alcune truculente storie del passato narrate dai personaggi stessi, quasi una parodia dei racconti intorno al fuoco tipici del western, ed una buona dose di grottesco visto che il ruolo del \u201ccane fedele\u201d che accompagna i nostri improbabili eroi nell\u2019estenuante caccia all\u2019uomo \u00e8 qui affidato a un grosso suino, di nome Hog (mica un porcello qualsiasi)!Un\u2019altra chiave di lettura potrebbe catalogare \u201cLa foresta\u201d come un romanzo di formazione, poich\u00e9 il giovanissimo e volenteroso narratore dovr\u00e0 attraversare un bel po\u2019 di prove del fuoco, dilemmi morali e scoperte sorprendenti sulla vera natura degli uomini (e delle donne\u2026), ma questa interpretazione pare contraddetta dall\u2019inaffidabilit\u00e0 dei \u201cmaestri di vita\u201d che la sorte ha riservato a Jack Parker, buoni per aiutarlo nella sua impresa usando (quando ce vo\u2019\u2026) maniere alquanto spicce, molto meno per impartire paradossali lezioncine di morale\u2026"}, {"userName": "Gef", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2433254-gef", "userReview": "It didn't take long for Joe Lansdale to become one of my favorite writers, after first reading his work just a few years ago. And while I haven't read all his books yet, by gawd I'm trying. From what I have read, I've noticed the man has a way of turning Texas into a near mythical place. Heck, maybe Texas is mythical and Lansdale is just passing word along. Whatever the case, his latest novel, The Thicket, presents an early-1900s East Texas as a land burgeoning into the modern age, with vestiges of the wild west all too present while harbingers of our modern times creeping into the landscape. One thing that seems to last forever is a thirst for justice.Jack Parker, the narrator of this story, recounts a chapter of his youth following the death of his parents as smallpox ravaged the countryside. He, in his mid-teens at the time, and his younger sister, Lula, wind up in the care of their grandfather who aims to take them to Virginia where they'll be raised by their aunt. But while crossing a river aboard a ferry, Jack's grandfather is shot by a murderous outlaw Jack comes to know as Cutthroat Bill. Before Bill and his cohorts can turn their guns on the two young ones, a twister capsizes the ferry, placing Jack on one side of the river and his sister and Cutthroat Bill on the other. From there, Jack begins an odyssey to rescue his sister and bring his grandfather's killer to justice.\"Odyssey\" seems like a good word too, as Jack's trek across Texas felt like a blend of True Grit and The Wizard of Oz. Charlie Portis' True Grit in the sense that it's a youth recruiting adults to chase an outlaw. L. Frank Baum's The Wizard of Oz in the sense that the journey feels almost other-worldly as Jack employs and ultimately befriends a ragtag bunch that includes a couple of cantankerous bounty hunters, an enterprising prostitute, and even a large hog that may be the most formidable member of the posse, only instead of a wicked witch tailing them, they're tailing a wicked man.What starts out as a coming-of-age revenge tale evolves as Jack's story progresses. If it had been kept to the matter-of-fact pursuit of a murderer, I would have still been on board, but Lansdale goes the extra mile in offering a conflicted young man who has trouble reconciling his rigid sense of right and wrong, instilled by his upbringing, and a growing thirst for revenge. There's this wonderful parallel set up between Jack's awkward steps into adulthood and that of the twentieth century's encroachment on the outskirts of Texas. Jack's world is eroding, his moral compass and reverence for his elders challenged, while the backdrop shows horses make way for new contraptions called automobiles, and talk of oil seems as much the talk of magic.Another of Lansdale's specialties comes to bear, with an expert balance of humor and horror, as Jack and his motley crew share mirthful and witty exchanges, then find themselves contending with the more vicious and unforgiving aspects of the wild west. The brutality in some scenes really makes you appreciate the humor in others. And sometimes it all happens at once, as evidenced by that unpredictable Hog and his eating habits. Such is life, whether old or modern, I suppose. On a side-note, this is the third book published by Mulholland Books that I've read this year, and all three have been notably diverse in tone, theme, and style (Duane Swierczynski's Point and Shoot and Lauren Beukes' The Shining Girls being the other two). Crime is a big tent genre and it's reassuring to see they've made room for eclectic gems like The Thicket."}, {"userName": "Amanda Lyons", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3216610-amanda-lyons", "userReview": "Lansdale has always been a great storyteller and The Thicket showcases his unique style and characterization beautifully. True to the dark and brutal past of turn of the century Texas it offers a very rich and original story to readers. If you enjoy westerns, Lansdale, tales from the dark old days of history or even just great characterization this book will be well worth your time. The Thicket is the story of Jack Parker a hard on his luck teen who, with his Grandfather and sister, have had to leave their smallpox ridden home town to set out for Kansas and a new life with an unknown Aunt. As with many a well laid plan before it, their Grandfather\u2019s plan to get Lula and Jack to family and a fresh start is waylaid by a gang of criminals. Separated from his family and told of Lula\u2019s kidnapping Jack sets out to try and save his sister but it seems just about everything is standing in his way. Fortunately for him, the long and winding path he takes eventually leads him to Eustace and Shorty, two bounty hunters who agree to help him on his quest. Less than certain of the men he\u2019s hired and more than a little green Jack faces many harsh truths about life and the potential outcome for Lula and himself not least of which is that The Thicket is a den of insanity, depravity and murder few escape. While Jack is less than certain of the path he\u2019s taking and the people leading him down that path he couldn\u2019t have been in better company. Eustace and his pet, Hog are a mixed bag of good intentions, honesty, instinct and unexpected edges of danger. Shorty is a man with a dark past that, while leaving him feeling less than satisfied with humanity and all its conceits, nevertheless makes him the wise and troubled man he is. The two of them have a unique friendship which slips back and forth between understanding and heckling, they are an odd couple born of need and compassion as much as happenstance. Jack is not so wise and unfamiliar with the ways of the world around him. For much of the journey he fights these darker truths in favor of the morality and conduct he was raised with, an outlook that clashes with that of Shorty, who chooses to see things through a darker glass. If you\u2019ve never read Lansdale you should know that he writes very quirky and interesting characters who often deal with bleak and challenging events over the course of their lives. He\u2019s very good at blending humor, tragedy and heart in his tales (whether novel length or short story) and can be very brutal, especially in his horror tales. I thoroughly enjoyed The Thicket, having eaten it up in a few days\u2019 time and am most fond of Shorty in particular who I couldn\u2019t help but imagine being played by Peter Dinklage, an actor I love for his wit and intellect. Lansdale has a very clear love for both Texas and the darker aspects of its past, both of which are on display here. I was reminded of classic western novels like Lonesome Dove and, of course, Lansdale\u2019s own weird west stories, all of which address the west and its dark history as it was rather than as many wish it were. That being said, if you aren\u2019t able to read books that deal with themes of rape, violence and racial conflict I recommend you don\u2019t give this one a go."}, {"userName": "Kevin", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11089210-kevin", "userReview": "Some writers these days, seem to write for the literary judging panels more so than the readers. With \u2018The Thicket\u2019, Joe Lansdale abandons such notions on page 1, if he ever harboured them in the first place, and sets out to thoroughly entertain the reader for 350 or so pages, and boy does he achieve that goal.Through the first person narrative of the naive young idealist Jack Parker, whose grandfather has been murdered and sister kidnapped, he assembles the motliest of motley crews to launch an unlikely retrieval mission for Lula, the sister in question. And when I say motley, I mean motley, cantankerous dwarf, badly scarred sheriff, reformed whore, alcoholic negro built like the proverbial outhouse, and a semi-domesticated hog with a mind of his own. The comedy sparks that fly off these characters when they rub each other up, provide ample opportunities for Lansdale to give free reign to his wit, with the resultant dialogue, one of the many joys of this book.I have now recognised a sub-genre from which I am gaining much pleasure. The \u2018southern gothic comedy western/drama\u2019, if such a genre exists. \u2018The Thicket\u2019 shares the same DNA as Patrick de Witt\u2019s \u2018Sisters Brothers\u2019, and much of Charles Portis\u2019 output , including \u2018True Grit\u2019. All of which are a hoot and hugely entertaining, to me at least. That Lansdale makes us really care about these battle-scarred characters, is part of the alchemy that makes a great writer, and as the last chapters rapidly approached, I hoped for a happy ending for all of them. Some of them didn\u2019t make it, but however dark the depths they went to on their journey, those that did make it, were better for the experience, much like the reader."}, {"userName": "Clark Hallman", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12101662-clark-hallman", "userReview": "The Thicket by Joe Lansdale is a terrific novel about ruthless violence, desperate survival struggles, the loyalty and trust of friends, the coming of age of a teenage boy, and much more.

I was totally enthralled by the characters in this book and by the superb story that Lansdale created for them. Every page of this book held my interest and propelled me to its conclusion. I recommend it to any adult, especially those who thrive on well-developed and fascinating characters, excruciating suspense and grievous violence.

His grandmother was killed in a farm accident when he was barely five years old. His parents have just succumbed to the smallpox epidemic sweeping turn-of-the-century East Texas--orphaning him and his younger sister, Lula.Then catastrophe strikes on the way to their uncle's farm, when a traveling group of bank-robbing bandits murder Jack's grandfather and kidnap his sister. With no elders left for miles, Jack must grow up fast and enlist a band of heroes the likes of which has never been seen if his sister stands any chance at survival. But the best he can come up with is a charismatic, bounty-hunting dwarf named Shorty, a grave-digging son of an ex-slave named Eustace, and a street-smart woman-for-hire named Jimmie Sue who's come into some very intimate knowledge about the bandits (and a few members of Jack's extended family to boot). In the throes of being civilized, East Texas is still a wild, feral place. Oil wells spurt liquid money from the ground. But as Jack's about to find out, blood and redemption rule supreme.
