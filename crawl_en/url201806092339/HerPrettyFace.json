First of all, can we talk about this cover?! Amazing! This was a very fast read for me. The story is told in three different POVs with short chapters which is always nice! Most of the chapters are in present time but we also have flashbacks. Frances Metcalfe is a wife and a protective mother. Her son, Marcus, has just been accepted to the private Forrester School. Her awkward son is big and is being bullied right away. Frances can feel the judgey vibes coming from \u201cthe cool moms\u201d. She feels like an outcast until she meets Kate. Kate is everything! She\u2019s beautiful, skinny and has a beautiful clean house. The two woman quickly become friends. It also helps that Kate\u2019s son becomes friends with Marcus. Kate also has a daughter named Daisy. She\u2019s in high school and goes through all the ups and downs of a teenage girl. The flashback chapters are mostly from DJ. We learn that his sister was murdered. Everything about the crime was gruesome. I enjoyed the whole court setting and trying to figure out who \u201cAmber\u201d was. As the two women get to know each other more, dark secrets from both of their pasts are close to being revealed and it will change their lives forever. Lies, secrets, murder, betrayal ooo so good! I give this 4.5 stars! I definitely recommend!"}, {"userName": "Sue", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3908840-sue", "userReview": "I was fortunate to win a copy of HER PRETTY FACE by Robyn Harding, through the Goodreads Giveaway Contest.

Frances Metcalfe is trying to care for her troubled son, Marcus, and maintain her marriage to her almost-perfect husband. When her son finally gets into the elite Forrester Academy, Frances sees this as a positive sign that her life is about to change. Then, when she meets the beautiful and charismatic Kate Randolph and is suddenly accepted into the social circle of the other Moms, Frances is overjoyed. Kate and Frances form a fast friendship however, one of the women holds a deep, dark secret. One of the women is Amber Kunik, an active participant in the rape and murder of a teenaged girl years ago. When the secret comes out, how far will the other go to protect her friend? Will she abandon her entirely? In \u201cHer Pretty Face\u201d by Robyn Harding, it is pretty predictable right off the bat which one of the women is Amber. However, this does not make the book any less appealing. Kate and Frances are both utterly likable and completely dissimilar characters, and their friendship is a very typical one (I mean, I guess? I can count my close female friendships on less than one finger.) The novel is well told, although it didn\u2019t really get going until about the midway point. Most of the beginning is spent detailing the budding relationship between Frances and Kate, and telling their respective background stories. Once I got through this part of the novel, I became thoroughly entertained. Even with the predictable ending, this novel was definitely exciting to read. This novel played out in a very similar way to the Paul Bernardo murders that occurred down in my area so I felt a personal connection to this novel too (makes sense that the author was Canadian). It helped that this novel touched a personal note, as it made the story completely relatable and the characters of Shane and Amber completely despicable. If this novel completely surprised me, I would have given it five-stars. However, since the novel was predictable and too much time was spent focusing on the women and their \u201csisterhood\u201d relationship, I downgraded it to a four. It is definitely worth a read though, especially for those who have an interest (like I do) in the inner workings of a sociopaths\u2019 relationships."}, {"userName": "Kaira Rouda", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3845795-kaira-rouda", "userReview": "Robyn Harding's talent shines through in HER PRETTY FACE.

Then \"cool mom\" Kate befriends her and their sons bond as well. Everything seems perfect.

Wow! A great surprise! I get this book for free on Netgalley like I often do, but mostly for children books or documentary, I don,t read much novel that way, but I want to do more. Anyway, all this to say that I was going in with no expectation at all. And it was great! A couple of \u00abpunch\u00bb are easy to see coming, but I got surprise more then once, so that's good. The writing, the rhythm and storyline are just awesome. Some characters are very good, others justed a bit unrealistic or just dumb in their action, so it's a bit harder to relate to them. The ending was good, but a bit too cheesy for my taste. But, in the end, this is a really good thriller that deserve more attention and should be read by the fan of that genre. On a more personal touch, I don't know why, but I just love those book about housewives, that get in trouble, and with dark secrets and all that, not really my style and I don't really know why, but those kind of story/atmosphere gets to me!"}, {"userName": "Meigan", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13576703-meigan", "userReview": "Frances Metcalfe is a woman most parents can relate to - feeling the insurmountable pressure of being the primary caretaker and possessing an equally insurmountable amount of \u2018mom guilt\u2019, she\u2019s trying and failing to balance parenting her often difficult son with everything else. Combine that with her overwhelming sense of insecurity, her lack of support system, and her isolated position, and every day in Frances\u2019 life threatens to be the one that finally sends her over the edge. What Frances needs is a friend, one who understands what she\u2019s going through, one who also sees the other private school moms as fakers, and that\u2019s exactly what she gets when she\u2019s befriended by Kate Randolph. While Frances desperately wants to fit in, Kate could fit seamlessly, but chooses not to. She\u2019s just the ally and friends that Frances needs, and they hit it off almost immediately. Problem is, one is lying to the other and while both women have deep secrets from their past, only one is a murderer. Touted as a domestic drama, Harding explores various facets of life that we all can relate to at one time or another including parenting struggles, feelings of inadequacy, marital pressures, and essentially trying to keep it all together when everything is coming at you all at once. There\u2019s often an overwhelming sense of guilt when things start falling by the wayside and it\u2019s hard not to compare yourself to someone who seemingly doesn\u2019t have any of those struggles. Though it turns out, some people are masters at hiding it and everyone goes through the same struggles at some point. Not only does this book deal heavily with every day life, it also explores change and if people really do, or if they are exceptionally good at hiding that part of their lives as well. My only complaint was the ending. It seemed too easy, really. I suppose in one way, it\u2019s a chance for readers to form their own conclusions on whether or not people can be reformed, but at the same time it left me with more questions pertaining to certain characters and I wanted a bit more...closure, I think. That\u2019s my only complaint and sometimes it\u2019s best not to have concrete answers to questions because that, too, would be too easy. All in all, Her Pretty Face was a fast-paced and enjoyable drama-slash-mystery that kept me glued to the pages, and certainly one that will make a perfect summer read. There\u2019s deception, lies, and murder, and it\u2019ll definitely be a story that will make you embrace your mundane life instead of wishing for a little more excitement :-) 3.5 stars.*Free copy for review provided through Goodreads Giveaways."}, {"userName": "Roz Nay", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17062813-roz-nay", "userReview": "This one's going to be a smash.

Her previous novel \u201cThe Party\u201d was a favourite summer read last year and a standout in the \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d like titles that seem to be rampant of late.\u201cHer Pretty Face\u201d is a chilling domestic drama about two women whose deep friendship is threatened by dark, long buried secrets. Packed with lies, deceit, and betrayal, this novel is an incredible addictive read that begs for accompaniment with a large glads of wine. Had it not been for an insanely hectic work week, I would have gobbled this story up in one sitting. Smartly set to be released in July, this is the epitome of a perfect summer read.Harding is to be commended for creating a story that pulls you in and grabs your attention despite having two some-what unlikable female characters at the forefront. It\u2019s clear from the get go that both women have dark pasts that simmer fervently under their private school mom & housewife exteriors. There is a definitely a vein of darkness here ... one that Harding does a good job of interweaving through not only the plot points of our main characters Frances and Kate (new synopsis indicates name change to Leigh) but the marginal players of the story as well.With a recognizable nod to the controversy surrounding the true Canadian crimes of Karla Homolka, this is a novel that deserves a spot on your summer TBR list."}, {"userName": "Colour Me Purple", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30658333-colour-me-purple", "userReview": "Her Pretty Face, Thanks to Galley Books and the publishers for selecting me to read an advance copy of Her Pretty Face in return for an honest review.A child is missing, two women meet, a stranger appears, and a man walks out of the past. Ms Harding takes these four apparently unrelated incidents and turns them into a riveting story of guilty secrets and hidden pasts. The women meet in the prestigious halls of a private college. Both have sons attending the college. One woman, Frances Metcalfe, is overweight, unsure of her husband\u2019s love, and with a complete lack of self-worth. She is treated like a pariah by the mothers of the Forrester Academy. The second is Kate Rudolph, sophisticated, attractive, outwardly at least, self-composed, she is a woman who would appear to have the world at her feet. Their sons are a reflection of their mothers. Marcus Metcalfe struggles every day to find his place with his school mates. He is a large boy, unskilled in socially niceties, who finds himself ostracized within the walls of the Academy. Charles Rudolph is his mother\u2019s golden boy, a fact that Daisy, 14, Charlie\u2019s older sister, takes very much to heart. After a particularly ugly incident at Forrester, Kate stands by Frances and her son, and the two become friends. This friendship expands to include the families of both woman. But now, hidden secrets, dark secrets, slowly come to light which will have a long-lasting impact on the lives of both families. Running throughout is the journey Daisy undertakes as events unfold. It is Daisy, confused and frightened, who stole my heart. The story contains some very graphic content as it takes a hard look at the seamier side of the world we live it. It hits just as hard at the terrible cruelty of pretentiousness and the damage that results from those who think themselves better than others who are struggling to improve their lot in live. It explores the many complexities of family life and how the choices and actions of family members, particularly parents, affect the lives and well-being of their children. What the book was not, at least for me, was a \u201csuspense\u201d novel. Mystery perhaps, but with the exception of one small fact, I pretty much sussed out what was going on early in the story. As seems to be a very popular format today, the story is written from the back-and-forth POV of the different characters.An excellent read.

The friendship between Kate and Frances, how that friendship developed and then how it disintegrated. The novel is written from three viewpoints:Frances- she's a mousy, timid kind of person and she has secretsDaisy- Kate's daughter, a teenager who has learned how to not care what others think of her. Daisy was actually one of my favourite charcters.DJ- brother of a young girl who was murdered. His recounting of the trial of his sister's murderer and how it affected his life is heartbreaking.While I was reading, I couldn't help thinking of the events surrounding one of Canada's most notorious murderers, Karla Homolka. The story is eerily similar and I couldn't help wondering if the author based this novel on those events. I'm sure many people would be curious about what happens to criminals in the years after their release from prison, how they cope with the notoriety and everyday life. This is what the book is about. We know that Kate or Francesca, both suburban mothers with a child at an elite private school, is the killer and part of the suspense of this novel is figuring out which one. They are both trying to live normal lives and they both have secrets. I liked that at the end, even though we know who the killer is, we don't know if they are actually guilty or innocent. It's all in how a person interprets the facts.

And this stupid, risky shit can result in one of them losing an eye \u2014 In the best case \u2014 or fucking dying \u2014 In the worst.And any time losing an eye is the better of two possible scenarios, you know things are pretty fucked up.The protagonist of this lesson-teaching novel is a suburban stay-at-home mom named Frances.Although it may appear that Frances has an idyllic life, living in a relatively wealthy community, married to an enviably handsome man and responsible only for the raising of her son, on the inside, her life is far from perfect for a number of reasons. Her beloved son, Marcus, who has always struggled socially, has found himself even further relegated to the outskirts of his peer group, thanks to a rather disgusting act of retaliation against a girl who was mean to him. Frances has felt the blowback from her son\u2019s behavior as it\u2019s resulted in other mothers at the hoity-toity private school questioning Frances\u2019 skills as a mother and value as a person. Because, in case you\u2019ve never experienced it yourself, the core group of stay-at-home-moms at any school \u2014 particularly a wealthy one \u2014 is eerily similar in composition and social power to The Plastics.Additionally, Frances is chubby \u2014 a character trait that I can totally empathize with. And, although she\u2019s not My-600-lb-life level of fat, she\u2019s always felt like this extra layer of padding has kept her from connecting with other mothers and further distinguished her from the super-mom herd \u2014 but not in a good way.We also learn pretty quickly that something happened in Frances\u2019s past that continues to haunt her to this day, further eroding any confidence she may have.So, when beautiful, put-together and pretty much universally admired Kate turns her attentions towards Frances, it seems almost too good to be true. Unlike Frances, Kate fits comfortably into the mom group. Her son Charles is well- behaved, cooperative and well-balanced \u2014 pretty much everything Frances\u2019 son Marcus is not. Despite the differences between these two boys, Charles and Marcus form a friendship, making the development of a relationship between Frances and Kate if not natural, at least mutually convenient.But as Frances gets closer to Kate, developing an increasing dependence on, and affinity for, this socially powerful woman, she begins to learn things about her friend that belie the admirable persona.This leaves Frances wondering. Could everything she believes to be true about Kate be but a collection of lies? And, if they are, is Frances really ready to extricate herself from Kate, socially, and stand on her own in a way she has never been able to before? From this start, this novel reminded me \u2014 in the best kinds of ways \u2014 of the wave-making Big Little Lies. As a mom and an educator, I find the natural dynamics of the parent social groups incredibly interesting. Just sitting back in the car-rider-pick-up-line, sipping on a coffee and watching the moms and dads interact like ants in a colony, constantly vying for a new position in the social order, is intriguing to see the least \u2014 and, honestly, overwhelming. The dynamics portrayed in this novel, while catty, were, in my opinion, entirely realistic. And, seeing them from this angle, was engaging if not enjoyable.But, ultimately, this novel wasn\u2019t just a commentary on how shitty power-moms can be. That was just one layer in a complicated, dare I say onionesque, plot.Underneath all of the social drama was a tightly-woven thriller that was authentically suspenseful, legitimately surprising and, above all, extremely believable.One critique I commonly have of contemporary thrillers is that they lack of character development. That was not the case here. Harding invested time and effort into developing her characters, making them lifelike people who we legitimately care about by the book\u2019s end. Ultimately, it was the combination of this naturally compelling plot and the genuinely engaging characters that made this a novel I couldn\u2019t help but power through.And, what\u2019s more, even when I wasn\u2019t reading the book, I found myself thinking about it. I found the plot and theme seeping into my everyday life, invading my thoughts and distracting me from my reality.My reading of this book so pervaded my life that, as I sat in Panera, finishing the novel and apprehensively alternating between sips of hazelnut coffee and nibbles of my gel polish covered nails, I found myself becoming alarmed. The source of my alarm - realizing that my 8-year-old was scheduled to attend a birthday spend the night that evening and would be under the watchful eye of Amanda, a woman who I befriended largely because our boys had an affinity for each other \u2014 God, the scenario sounded familiar.Too familiar, in fact. *Spoilers Ahead*So, seeking reassurance, I did what any normal mom would do. I texted her, pretty much straight out asking if she was a murderer \u2014 which, I mean, might not have been the way to go.As I read her \u2014 hopefully \u2014 tongue-in-cheek responses, I realized that I was wrong. The lesson that this book in particular, and Robyn Harding\u2019s books in general, have taught me is not \nwhat\n could happen. I knew that long ago for I was once a teen. I moved though that distinctly dangerous epoch in which, despite the fact that I was woefully unaware of the realities of life, I was filled with the misguided belief that I knew all there was to know. No, what I have come to understand better after reading these books is what my role is now. As a parent.Despite the fact that I may at times want to invest in the development of an age-progression-stunting serum for my own sons \u2014 currently 8 years old and just under 2 \u2014 I have to allow them to grow. I have no real choice but to give them space and just hope that they don\u2019t engage in any hijinks that result in the loss of an eye or, worse yet, death.And, as legitimately scary as this thriller is, that realization is even scarier.Because this book wasn\u2019t just terrifying, it was also terrifyingly good, I give it 5 out of 5 cocktails."}, {"userName": "Ashley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28820519-ashley", "userReview": "Good god, Robyn Harding is good. RELEASE DATE: July 2018PUBLISHER: Gallery Books / Simon and Schuster Canada DISCLAIMER: Novel sent via NetGallery in exchange for a honest review. SYNOPSIS: Frances Metcalfe is struggling to stay afloat. A stay-at-home mom whose troubled son is her full-time job, she thought that the day he got accepted into the elite Forrester Academy would be the day she started living her life. Overweight, insecure, and lonely, she is desperate to fit into Forrester\u2019s world. But after a disturbing incident at the school leads the other children and their families to ostracize the Metcalfes, she feels more alone than ever before. Until she meets Leigh Randolph. Leigh is everything Frances is not: beautiful, wealthy, powerful, and confident. And for some reason, she\u2019s not interested in being friends with any of the other Forrester moms\u2014only Frances. As the two bond over their disdain of the Forrester snobs and the fierce love they have for their sons, a startling secret threatens to tear them apart\u2026because one of these women is not who she seems. Her real name is Amber Kunick. And she\u2019s a murderer.REVIEW: I delved into this book the moment I received it from NetGallery. I was thoroughly entertained and I devoured the entire novel in one wonderful Saturday night. ** NOTE ** In the novel I read, Leigh's name is Kate. ** This novel was sublime. I'm a heavy reader - I read a lot, I read often, and I read quickly. In doing so, I sometimes find in the less entertaining novels, my eyes seemingly skim over paragraphs of text in order to get to the 'good parts. I've actively tried to stop doing this, but sometimes it seems like a blase plot line makes me actively try to finish the book faster. Not so with HER PRETTY FACE.I read \nevery. damn. word\n. At the centre of this novel are Kate and Frances, two opposite women who have similar societal issues. Firstly, Frances is all of us - she's a little awkward, a little chubby, and a lot self-conscious. When plucked into the world of private school, the picture perfect mom's have her running for the hills. What doesn't help is the fact that her son is a little different - and difference in a private school setting is self-sabotage. Enter Kate. Kate's beautiful, slim, with a picture perfect family but low on actual friends. Frances and Kate seem like the perfect pair then - the ying to someones yang, bringing out the best in each other. I think that is what I enjoyed most about Frances and Kate's initial friendship - Kate brought Frances outside of her shell. What was also beautiful about this novel was the theme of secrets. Obviously, Kate has a rather big one but it turns out Frances has a tragic past as well. The build up to France's secret is well done, and truly shows why she seizes up and is self conscious in all situations. The theme of regret runs rogue through this novel - Frances has life trauma where regret is seemingly ruining the possibility of her and her family having a normal life. Can Frances move on from mistakes of the past? Can Frances ever have a normal life? Regret is also at the stem of Kate's and Frances' eventual friendship, as Frances searches for regret in her best friend's current- does Kate regret what she did? Can Kate make amends? Can Frances still be friends with someone labelled a murderer? This novel is just damn good - told through three perspectives, it gives us 360 insight into the past, present, and future. First is Frances narrative, next is Kate's daughter's narrative, and lastly is the brother to the murder victim DJ. The perspectives weave seamlessly into one another, and I can't truly say that I enjoyed one perspective over the other. They were all so well done. Again, the themes of guilt and regret run rampant through all three narratives, but each in a different way. One gripe - I feel that the synopsis gives a little too much away. I would have preferred not to know that Kate and Amber were one in the same. For us Canadian's, this story seemed highly memorable - I found myself thinking many times of Karla Homolka while reading this novel. There are many similar ideas here. I wasn't surprised to realize that the author is Canadian. Harding's THE PARTY has been sitting on my bookshelf for ages - perhaps this is next?

I found the characters more believable and compelling than those in many books of the genre. The story was riveting and I found it difficult to put the book aside.  This is a story of dark secrets, manipulation, betrayal and a past murder. Why only a 3 star review from me? Despite the disclaimer that any connection with any real life character was coincidental, the crime and sentencing exactly mirrors a notorious, well known case in Canada. This made parts of the book overly disturbing to read.  Frances is a stay-at-home Mom, overprotective of her son Marcus. Marcus has no friends, is awkward, withdrawn and bullied. He also has issues of self control. Frances has marked feelings of inferiority, is overweight and feels unattractive. When Marcus is accepted into an elite private school, she feels ignored by the wealthy, snobbish and glamorous moms, and her insecurity increases.  When Marcus retaliates against an incidence of bullying, the manner he chooses causes anger amongst the parents. They consider her an unfit mother due to her son\u2019s behaviour and ostracize Frances further.  Frances is befriended by Kate, a confident, beautiful mother of a young boy attending the school. They soon bond over their disdain of the other mothers\u2019 social clique and their sons. Frances is overjoyed. They become best friends, even soul mates. Kate\u2019s son and Marcus are close in age and the two boys become friends. Now a more confident Frances and son become much better accepted at the school. There is foreshadowing than one of these two women has a sinister, murderous past. Which one, and what will the effects of its revelation have on the characters and their families?The chapters are told from Frances\u2019s viewpoint, the story of Kate\u2019s unhappy, rebellious teenaged daughter,Daisy, and past events by DJ whose older sister was abducted and brutally murdered years before. There are some unexpected twists in the story.Thanks to NetGalley and Simon& Schuster/Scout Press for an advance copy of Her Pretty Face in exchange for an honest review.

This question is at the heart of Her Pretty Face, and causes one of the main characters to question everything she knows.The story centres around two women. Frances is a stay-at-home-mom who is struggling to fit in with the other parents at her son\u2019s private school. An incident with her son makes matters worse, until she meets Kate. Kate doesn\u2019t care about what any of the other parents think of her, and stands up for Frances. The two become fast friends, but each are hiding secrets of their own. While they are both trying to keep their pasts private, a series of events brings old information to light, and it\u2019s darker than you could have ever imagined.Like many contemporary thrillers, Her Pretty Face is told from multiple first-person perspectives, and bounces back and forth between different timelines (in this case, \u201cthen\u201d and \u201cnow\u201d). Unlike others I\u2019ve read, this one was very easy to follow. There are also a few newspaper articles thrown in the narrative as well, which mixed things up a bit, and added more depth to the story.I will admit, I found the whole \u201cwho is the criminal\u201d mystery a little obvious, but that did not at all disinterest me from the story. In fact, after guessing who it was, I wanted to read even more to find out what exactly happened to get that particular character to where they were in the present. It\u2019s definitely an emotional story, and a bit graphic, too.In fact, the crime in this novel reminded me quite a bit of an infamous Canadian case, although I won\u2019t say which one right now, because I don\u2019t want to give away any spoilers.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was entertaining, emotional, fast-paced, and kept me on my toes until the end.

I love it so much! Secondly I definitely recommend this book!! It\u2019s all encompassing and captivating, a wonderful read. It keeps you guessing until the very end and once I put it down my mind was just reeling! This book was absolutely one I didn\u2019t want to end. I completely devoured this book and enjoyed every questioning and confusing second of it! It makes you feel pain for the characters, grieve for their loss, feel overwhelming heartache for the hardships, and makes you connect with them and understand them on a level that puts you in their position and makes you feel like you are them. Daisy: Where to even begin with Daisy... I feared for her, sympathized with her, my heart aches for her, and I felt utter relief and an overwhelming protectiveness for her. Frances: I felt like I could relate with everything she\u2019s been through, the emotional struggle, the remorse, the protectiveness of her son. She\u2019s such a great character and very relatable.DJ: I cried for him, felt confusion, betrayal, and pity towards him, but yet absolutely loved him! He was the perfect person to see the stories unfold through his point of view. And then there\u2019s David (whom I thought was the same as DJ for the ENTIRE book) and then all of a sudden in the very end it wasn\u2019t. I was confused by David at first and still don\u2019t quite understand what is going to happen with him and Daisy but I was so thankful he was there when she needed him and he gave her the safe haven she so desired even though it was slightly inappropriate. I still appreciate the role he played in the storyline. Overall I must say this is a MUST READ!! Very good book, well written, and definitely keeps you guessing.

All of the characters in this story are unhappy and have dark secrets. They all have major issues. Each have unresolved conflict within themselves. There are no healthy relationships in this book. Each person is a lone sailor in the storm of life. Each is tortured by their past, which affects their present life and their ability to lead a normal existence.I spent a lot of time thinking about these characters and how their storylines would eventually converge. I did guess some of it, and other twists were a surprise. I was bracing for murder, kidnapping, revenge, and violence, and held my breath waiting for this to happen, because each character was acting like a ticking time bomb and it was only a matter of time before someone exploded. I loved how the storylines came together, and all of the connections were revealed by the end. There was even some healing and coming to terms by the end, which makes this a great story.The writing style is descriptive, engaging, and fast paced. Each chapter flew by, and this was a quick read for me. This is my first read of Robyn Harding's work, and I really enjoyed it. This book reminds me of Jar of Hearts by Jennifer Hillier.
