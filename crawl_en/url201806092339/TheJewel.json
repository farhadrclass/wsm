And he was not a faithful husband. He had illegitimate children both before and during his marriage to Jean. Some writers might excuse his behavior, perhaps making Jean seem beneath him. Others might make Jean the victim of a faithless man. The Jewel hits just the right note. In this excellently researched novel, Czerkawska does a brilliant job of depicting this brilliant but flawed man and convincing us that despite everything Jean was his true love. After reading this book, I could see why Jean would stay with him and was a bit in love with him myself. There is so much to recommend about this book, even beyond the story of the main characters. Czerkawska invites us into Rab and Jean ' s world and teaches us so much about everyday life in late 18th century Ayrshire. She has a wonderful sense of place. This book is truly a Jewel!"}, {"userName": "Gillian", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12072627-gillian", "userReview": "A lovely book, if a little glossy as it paints Burns as a lovable rogue and \"nice guy really\" ! I did enjoy it however, though I am not usually attracted to historical novels."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1710557-amy", "userReview": "A lovely book about Jean and Robert (Rab) Burns, told from Jean's POV. I learned a lot about the poet's life that I'd not known, as well as life in general at the time. Definitely a complicated relationship, and a complex and complicated genius of a poet."}, {"userName": "Lesley", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5542395-lesley", "userReview": "A very sweet tale of 'ploughman poet' Robert Burns and his wife Jean Armour. I didn't know much about her at all. Her life wasn't all plain sailing, that's for sure. Sometimes the language, despite a glossary, was a stumbling block and also a factual error in talk of Nigeria, which didn't exist as a country in the 18th Century. An enlightening read, overall."}, {"userName": "Duntay", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/959546-duntay", "userReview": "I bought the book after hearing a talk by the author. She mentioned the watch- paper Valentine http://artdaily.com/news/66501/Robert... (I hope 'Anonymous buyer' lets the rest of the world see it sometime) and I became interested in the actual objects and documents the author framed her story around. As she says in the Historical Note to the book, \"The casual reader might be surprised by what is documented fact and how little is invention\"."}], "description": "The Jewel is set largely during the dramatic years of Jean Armour and Robert Burns's courtship in Mauchline, their married life at Ellisland and in Dumfries, and Robert\u2019s early death, all against a background simmering with political intrigue and turmoil. Jean, a beautiful young woman with the voice of a nightingale, has been inexplicably neglected by biographers and historians. At first, her stonemason father tried to protect the young Jean from the advances of the mercurial ploughman-poet, whose roving eye and even delusions of grandeur were notorious. Nevertheless, she fell for him and accepted his proposal. Their extraordinary marriage was passionate, tempestuous, and enduring against all odds, and its rocky course reveals Jean\u2019s indomitable strength and character. How she lived with, and frequently without, Scotland\u2019s most famous son tells us much about the life and times of Burns himself, and is a compelling story in itself.", "title": "The Jewel", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29502055-the-jewel", "average": 4.2, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1461082164l/29502055.jpg", "reviews": 5, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1278708.Catherine_Czerkawska", "name": "Catherine Czerkawska"}], "type": ["Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29502055-the-jewel", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30064281-the-jewel", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11850918-the-curiosity-cabinet", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17378315-the-physic-garden", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13580020-the-amber-heart", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13554798-bird-of-passage", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16128529-ice-dancing"]}
