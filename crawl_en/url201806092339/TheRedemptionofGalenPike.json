The crowning achievement of this short story collection is 'The Quiet,' an unsuspecting narrative with a chilling conclusion. The book's titular story, 'The Redemption of Galen Pike,' offers a satisfying payoff, and 'Sibyl' is good for a chuckle. Unfortunately, the remaining stories are too elusive or ineffectual to garner much enjoyment.

Each story is a gem, a wildly imaginative look at the hardships and beauty of life. Davies infuses each interesting tale with raw emotion and observations as her characters grapple with the unpredictability of the world. A man shares a story with Queen Victoria; a teenage girl runs away from home; a woman has a visit from her new neighbor; a famous writer gets a new bonnet. No matter what the tale, this collection is filled with unique visions of loss and pain, but also filled with surprises and humor. My favorite story is the title story, about a kindly Quaker woman who visits a doomed prisoner in a Colorado jail. I cheered at the end of that story, but I sighed at the end of the book, for it was over much too soon. Can\u2019t wait to see what Davies does next.\u2014 Liberty Hardyfrom The Best Books We Read In March 2017: http://bookriot.com/2017/04/04/riot-r..."}, {"userName": "Laysee", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4863523-laysee", "userReview": "\u201cThe Redemption of Galen Pike\u201d is a 148-page collection of 17 short stories, each of which packs a punch. It is the 2015 Winner of the Frank O' Connor International Short Story Award and winner of the 2011 V.S. Pritchett Memorial Prize. A short story is an exceedingly difficult literary undertaking and it is remarkable that Carys Davies succeeded in making each story memorable. I am amazed at how unfailingly each story builds up to an unexpected ending. Davies' prose is spare but lovely.The stories take place in diverse settings, such as a remote farm in Australia, a city in the UK or US, including Siberia and a jail cell. The characters are ordinary people with their idiosyncratic vulnerabilities. Yet people really are not all that different no matter where they live. In many of these stories, strangers find a connection in a shared secret (e.g., \u201cThe Quiet\u201d) or experience (e.g., \u201cJubilee\u201d).Below are a few of my favorite stories. I shall refrain from revealing the ending to each story as that is the real treat.The QuietNothing is what it seems in this story. A newly married woman reluctantly lets into her house a seedy-looking neighbor when her husband is away and I read with bated breath the consequences she and I anticipate. However, her feelings of vulnerability commute to a shell-shocked but not unwelcome connection.JubileeArthur Pritt, an alderman, meets the Queen. She is stone-faced and bored by all the celebratory activities the town is putting up for her. Arthur is apologetic that she is not treated to a more imaginative welcome. But he recognizes in her a loss he has also experienced, albeit different. So he offers her a personal gift, which becomes, I believe, the highlight of her visit. As in \u201cThe Quiet\u201d, strangers are more connected to each other than they will ever know. The Travellers A lady from Birmingham leaves her husband in a fit of anger and sets up an inn in Siberia. She meets a couple who arrives in the dead of a very frosty winter's night, sullen and furious at each other. The fight? It is over something many of us can relate to in an instant. But the consequences are way out of proportion to the aggravation and shake me to the core of my being. It is a moving story. It is a good reminder of how love can be snuffed out by fury: \"I thought of how every single time it happened, my heart shrivelled up into a tiny dry peanut without the tiniest drop of love left inside it...\u201d Familiar? Be very afraid of the fallout when one is \u201cspeechless with incandescent fury\u201d.Bonnet This tops my list of favorite stories in this collection. It tells a poignant story of an obscure middle-aged female writer (supposedly Charlotte Bronte) off to London to meet her young handsome publisher. The step she takes in a bid to make an impression is so tenderly told I live her awkwardness and squirm in pain at the embarrassment that ensues. The last line is epic! The Taking of Bunny ClayThis is a story about a Haitian babysitter and her relationship with her American employers. It has elements of tenderness: a mother's anxiety about her baby with corn-colored hair; a babysitter's deepening affection for another's child. Again, the story has an unexpected ending - not the one I fear but far worse. The Redemption of Galen Pike The titular story is a moving one about a Quaker woman who visits a felon on death roll. Even though she is repulsed by his crime, she brings biscuits and cordial and sits companionably with him in the short week leading to his execution. Here again, we have strangers reaching out to each other and forging a human connection. How is Galen Pike redeemed? After his death, the reason for her revulsion of his crime is revealed. In this review I have kept to only the few stories I particularly like but all the stories are good reads in their own right."}, {"userName": "Lauren ", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren", "userReview": "...

A few I didn't find quite as compelling."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9467019-karen", "userReview": "I've never been much of a fan of short stories. I can admire the skill needed to create compelling characters, evoke a sense of place and tell a well rounded story all within a few thousand words. But when I read a short story I always get to the end feeling I've been short changed; that I'm just getting into it only to find myself adrift.But two recent collections have shown that maybe the problem is that I just hadn't found the right author.I ordered The Redemption of Galen Pike by Carys Davies on the day it was announced she had won a 2015 Jerwood Fiction Uncovered Award and I discovered she comes from my home country of Wales. We have so few good contemporary authors that I wanted to show my support. I must have been in a fog at the time because I didn't even twig that this was a collection of short stories.Having now read it I can only concur with one of the Jerwood judges who called this collection 'stunning'. It's a slim book of 17 stories one of which Nothing Like My Nightmare is essentially a paragraph; a complete story told in 186 words by an unnamed narrator (a parent I surmise) reflecting on all the things that could go wrong as the daughter embarks on a flight overseas. Without spoiling the effect I'll just say that the final sentence caught me so unawares I gasped.The other stories, many of which have won prizes or been shortlisted in competitions, show the infinite variety of Carys Davies' use of the short story form. They vary wildly in location from the wilds of Siberia to a remote farm in the Australian outback and a prison in a small Oklahoma community. It's hard to determine exactly the time period in which some of the stories are set \u2014 the only clue in Precious, for example, a story about a foolish, idolised middle aged man who falls for his young cleaner, comes early on when he describes arriving at an apartment dragging his wheeled suitcase.Many of these stories convey a impression of the vulnerability experienced by individual members of the human race and their consequent desire to connect with a fellow creature. In the title story, the connection is motivated by the desire of a Quaker spinster to bring comfort to a condemned prisoner and persuade him to cleanse his soul before death. When he rejects her overtures she simply sits with him in compatible silence waiting for the moment when he feels ready to talk. In another story, a woman reluctantly lets a neighbour into her home while her husband is away, believing him to be obnoxious only to discover they endure the same painful secret.Vulnerability isn't confined to ordinary people in Carys Davies' world. She delivers a delightful story of a man's daring attempt to rescue the widowed Queen Victoria from yet another desperately dull official event by relating a story about his wife's infidelity. Another, rather poignant, tale brings us Charlotte Bronte purchasing a new hat before a meeting with the publisher to whom she's rather taken a shine.These are stories that are hard to resist reading in one sitting. But they are best savoured in small doses, the more fully to enable the resonance of each to linger."}, {"userName": "Josh Ang", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4870273-josh-ang", "userReview": "Once in a long while a short story collection comes out of the blue and smites you so hard you can\u2019t help but fall completely under its spell. The Redemption of Galen Pike is one such precious find. Carys Davies displays surprising range and depth, and each story is unique in setting and characters, and they are all as engaging as they are shocking. In the first story, \u201cThe Quiet\u201d, a young beautiful wife who moves to a quiet and isolated part of a rural community receives unwanted attention from a lonely misshapen neighbour, and the reader feels the danger lurking ever nearer as her husband leaves for town and his buggy comes round to her door, but it does not go quite the way we anticipate.In \u201cThe Coat\u201d, what looks like hopeless denial turns to something else when an abandoned wife, Evangelina, hangs on to her husband\u2019s coat. In a short concise statement, Davies manages to not only convey Evangelina\u2019s blind belief, and thus evoke pathos for her, she also manages to vividly allude to her environs effectively: \u201cEvangelina was the only person who didn't believe that the emptiness out in the bay, the mist, and the water creeping soundlessly back and forth beneath the moon, in and out over the sands, were the silence of a man who was doing his best to disappear\u201d. And this is not a one-off instance in the collection. In whichever story there, Davies always consistently weaves in just the right diction, and uses metaphors consistent with the setting of that story universe. For example, in the title story, pious do-gooder Patience Haig faces opposition in setting up a home for unmarried mothers in the conservative Piper City, and her brother Walter teases her about her judgement of the mayor having \u201cno light of God\u201d. She retorts: \u201cDoubtless it is there in some dark silk-lined pocket of his embroidered waistcoat but if it is he keeps it well hidden\u201d, which is totally in keeping with the religiosity of Patience and the dress-style of that specific time and place.Interspersed within the collection are also mini pieces, which are more like micro-fiction, but even in their brevity, Davies manages to engage and shock. What I had thought was a humorous piece took off on a totally different direction in a space of a few paragraphs and left me reeling with the inadequacy of my initial reaction way after i finished the last sentence of that piece. Completely enjoyable. This collection promises greater things to come from a relatively new author."}, {"userName": "Rodney", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2363366-rodney", "userReview": "There's a ton of hype behind this book, but I'm sorry--I can't help but resist the old-fashioned O. Henry twist that nearly every story ends on. One story, \"The Coat,\" had two. Perhaps it's because I just finished Atwood's Dancing Girls, where every story involves layer after layer of emotional ambivalence, nothing is ever resolved, and the story ends by opening up rather than closing down. The writing is solid (and sometimes really funny), but Davies seems to me a plot-writer more than a character-writer and I just couldn't get on board. Your mileage may vary, especially if you're into this kind of Twilight Zone-ish/Shyamalan-esque surprise.

Davies' writing style is deceptively simple and straightforward, old-fashioned even. Yet, each story ends with an unexpected twist, sometimes rather shocking, that packs an emotional punch.

One by one, each it's own separate world, the stories here made me think, opened my mind, revealed more questions, and offered no simple answers. There is a pure precision in the way Davies writes, and it concerns me that readers might have a tendency to call her writing simple. It's not simple. It's masterful. She carves away anything unnecessary and leaves only what the reader can make use of -- the story has the exact amount of information it needs, the peace and solace for contemplation without sacrificing momentum or complex thought. I honestly don't know how she does it. She writes a good story. She makes you feel alone. She makes you feel less alone. She makes you laugh at yourself and the world and grieve it all, too. She knows how to set up a story, how to surprise and satisfy the reader without pandering or condescending or giving up on us. She's not a lazy writer, and I'm so impressed by her. Would this book work for book clubs? Yes. In a book club, members would have endless topics for discussion. I hesitate to name a few, because I don't want to indicate that this is all there is. But here goes: Domestic violence, lost love, the misguided notion that you can ever really know another person, our sad attempts to share sympathy with strangers, marital stubbornness, wishes that go unfulfilled, the desire to be good, the wish for company, the eschewing of romance... There's plenty here about the secret parts of a human heart.

Please go pick up this collection IMMEDIATELY. 4.5/5 stars. As the first story it progresses, you think you know exactly where it's going and a queasy feeling bubbles up in your stomach while you try to decide if you want to finish the story or not, sure that it's just gonna be one of THOSE types of stories and you really don't want to read another when it's already everywhere and then\u2014The moment the pin drops is exquisite. And that's the moment you become addicted.Davies writes short stories like they're poetry. The rich details of everything you need to know is hidden in very precise, deliberate language that only explicitly shares the bare bones. Each have a turn that decimates everything you've been presuming up to that moment, which she then resolves in only the space of another paragraph or two. You have to and will want to reread each story multiple times to piece together the details and determine if you are, in fact, reading what you think you're reading. (You are. It's just unbelievable.)I already know that some of those snap moments, the twists, are going to stay with me forever. The way they swung my emotions into a 180 and made me question myself was such a strong emotion that I physically felt it as I was reading, suddenly returned to my body even as I was still immersed in this book. I marvel at her uncanny ability to manipulate language to make you easily follow along with ideas and stereotypes until one sentence flips a mood. Sometimes, the stories are a little too opaque or have a background that you have to look for elsewhere\u2014I didn't know one was about 9/11 or another about Queen Elizabeth II until someone else mentioned it to me. The story about a Bronte sister is only explained in a note at the end of the book. And the stories make more sense with those contexts, and the clues to search for them are tough to pick out sometimes. While some of the stories deliberately mess with your confusion to leave you a bit unsatisfied, a handful were just too unsatisfying to me because I just couldn't visualize all the moving parts and hints. (There are SO MANY for stories that are only like 3 pages long, yet most become simple in the end). But these were few and far between and the other stories in the collection more than make up for the few that you inevitably will not enjoy as much. My faves: The Quiet, The Taking of Bunny Clay, Miracle at Hawk's Bay, In the Cabin in the Woods, The Coat (Harold can go SUCK IT OKAY), The Redemption of Halen Pike, Wicked Fairy, Nothing Like My Nightmare, and Sibyl. Yes, 9 of them were my favorite. They're that good. If you like Hemingway, these stories will be right up your alley, though with a bit more prose in its shape. If you don't like Hemingway, this is the closest you'll get to him and still love what you read. I think some of her writing is flat out better than his, and definitely more palatable in many cases. And the last story will leave you with a happy, sappy smile on your face, after putting you through the wringer for the first 16 stories. It's sweet, really. Just go read these. They're so short. They're easy to pick up, read in 1-5 minutes, think about while you're doing other things, then the next 5 spare minutes you have you're guaranteed go back. Please. Read.

If a short story gets me invested in the characters and takes me on a journey with them, I often feel its a waste to abandon the story before it has grown into a fuller thing. Not so with these. In these stories, you get an incredibly vivid but brief glimpse at something, just long enough for you to get oriented, get interested, form an idea, and then... oh. OH. And that's all that there should be. The work is done.Personal favorites: The Quiet (This opening story is what made me pick this up in the first place.
