The finger sandwiches and pastries are from Paris. And the Devonshire cream is from Devonshire.\u201dHe went all over Europe picking out food for me? How\u2019s this happening right now?\nThis book is about witchcraft, and it is the silliest book I've ever read about the subject. I've read plenty of books with very young MCs (the one in this book is 15) that are likable, and the story well-written. This book isn't one of them. It is laughable, and the only reason I think anyone should read it is for pure amusement at how excruciatingly painful it is.This book was fluffy, contrived, full of stereotypes, without an ounce of originality in how it presents its characters. It is complete with mean girls, which, to be fair, is the (movie) concept with which is aspires to associates itself, brooding \"bad boys\", a love triangle, and a wicked, bitchy stepmother.The MC is a tomboyish, pretty, and finds a way to indirectly humble-brag almost immediately after we meet her.\n\u201cUh, Sam. Everyone calls me Sam.\u201d\u201cNonsense. That\u2019s a boy\u2019s name. Now, aren\u2019t you pretty. Too skinny, though.\u201d\nYawn. Her narrative is undoubtedly fifteen-year-old, for better or worse. For example, her internal monologue.\nDon\u2019t laugh at me. You probably never had an awkward moment in your life, with all your floppy blond hair and tanned skin. So shut it!\nUnfortunately, since it is first-person POV, the book definitely reads like a middle grade book. Some books find ways to make up for that fact; some middle-grade books can be truly poignant. This book is not one of them.The adults are so mean. All of the authoritarian figures pick on her for no good reason, for speaking up a little bit, for being picked on. There is, hilariously, I might add, a clique of Salem descendants.\n \u201cHave you noticed a group of girls in my grade that wear all black\u2014rich goth types?\u201d\u201cThe Descendants?\u201dI venture a look at Jaxon. \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cLike that?\u201d He nods toward a guy and a girl entering the room. The guy wears an expensive-looking black button-down shirt, black pants, and black loafers. And she has on a floor-length black dress with a tailored black blazer. Her hair is a perfect bob.\nCome on, you can't tell me that's fucking hilarious. Even the love triangle is clich\u00e9d, with a handsome, boy-next-door blond and a dark, brooding, mysterious dark, floppy-haired boy with a secret *howls with laughter*\nI suddenly become very conscious that Jaxon\u2019s arm is around me, and I break contact. I shouldn\u2019t care if Elijah sees that. The thought tugs at me uncomfortably.\nI honestly have no idea how this book got a rating above 4."}, {"userName": "Jeff Zentner", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/129306-jeff-zentner", "userReview": "I loved every minute of this twisty-turny book. I wonder what Cotton Mather would think if he found out that his great great great great great (you get the picture) granddaughter wrote one of the best YA books I've ever read...and it happened to be about the Salem Witch Trials.This book is absolute thrilling, spooky fun. It's not a short book, but it feels like it, such is the tightness and pace of the plotting. There's nary a wasted word. You'll find yourself, as I did, unable to put it down, pressing ever forward, hours be damned. This is truly a corn maze of a book. A corn maze on a blustery, chilly October night, that you stumble through while holding the hand of someone with whom you just fell in love, your heart pounding from suspense and infatuation. The autumnal atmosphere is so lovingly crafted, so vivid, so creepily quaint. You'll feel the ghosts of Salem tugging at your sleeves while you read. You'll feel the leaves crunching under your feet. The only thing more well-drawn than the atmosphere is the characters. They leap from the page--vibrant, flawed, vulnerable, achingly real and honest. You'll have no trouble rooting for them.This book contains the perfect amount of everything. Humor. Romance. Wit. The paranormal. Chills. Mystery. There's a twist in this book that will have you picking up your jaw. Oh, and the bonus? It's the most beautifully packaged YA book I've ever seen. The cover and typefaces are sublime. That may sound silly, but that's important to me.I predict that with all of the things that work perfectly in this book, it's going to be very big indeed. In recent years, YA publishing has shied away from publishing books with paranormal elements. I predict this book will break that trend (even as it creates a very high bar).

In fact, if I weren\u2019t curious from the very beginning about Salem and the Witch Trials, this is a book I would have put aside early on.Because it feels as if it was written by someone who has a story to tell, but no wondrous writing skills.

This also isn\u2019t for you if you want realism to dominate, since one of the main characters is a ghost and there are numerous paranormal events.However, this is the book for you if, like me, witches are creatures you admire and constantly want to learn more about.

There also very much is a plot here, therefore, the characters are not wandering around \u2013 they each have a role to play.The heroine is judgemental, impatient, reckless and, sometimes, plain stupid.

COOL RIGHT!This book isn't one that I could say \"the best\", I can't say that right from the very first start it will capture you. To be honest, I've managed to read almost 30 pages before deciding that this book is good. Adriana brings us to the present-day Salem. Samantha Mather, together with her stepmother moved to Salem, specifically to her grandmother's house. Being a descendant of the man who's mention to be a great supporter to the Witch Trials- Cotton Mather, isn't easy. Sam became a leper in school, in town. The so-called Descendants of the Witches torments her, which makes her life in Salem, hell. To top it all, she's having troubles with a guy spirit at home. The main character,  Samantha Mather  , is stubborn, she's ill-tempered. But she is brave, fearless, but she is determined to fight for the people around her, to save their lives even if it means risking hers. Salem was completely ascertained.  There were a lot of creepy and strange stuffs. Their beliefs are a bit unnerving. I haven't been to that place. And even if I'm creeped out, I wanted to visit Salem. I was trying to figure out where the title fits in, not until I read a part (almost at 1/2 of the book). Finally, the title fell into its rightful place.What freaked me out most is the paranormal love interest of the characters. I still can't stand the idea of a spirit falling in love with a living girl, and vice versa. Thank goodness, there's not much for a love triangle.  How to Hang a Witch  gives us high school vibes, mainly its social hierarchy. The book also carries the angst of being a new student, someone who's new in town, an outsider. The book's concept is distinct. It has this perfect blend of mystery, thriller, and suspense. Not to mention romance and humor. It has utmost factor of spook. It's packed with unearthly run-ins that will make your spine tremble in thrill. Adriana Mather is impressive when it comes to misleading her readers.  There were times when I'm positive that my predictions are true. Then she'll just bitchslap me in the face as if saying.  \"you think so? Ha!\"  This book is full of surprises and it pleased me. Warning: The book, and its author is deceiving! And that's truly awe-inspiring. Readers will acknowledge the evocative locale of this book.  \"Salem isn't like other places.\"  -Adriana Mather"}, {"userName": "Sarah (thegirltheycalljones)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32607699-sarah-thegirltheycalljones", "userReview": "[one of them (the brooding Brunette one, obv) is a ghost?

They are not impressed with the arrival of Sam, especially when people start dying, leaving Sam to take the blame. They believe that she is cursed and want her to leave.Is Samantha really cursed, or are there far greater evil forces in Salem?I love a good story about witches, and How to Hang a Witch was definitely good. In fact, it was more than that, it was amazing. It was so good that I ordered the sequel, Haunting the Deep, and I am already half way through.Whilst the story might be fictional, the Salem Witch hangings are certainly true, and being a Mather herself, the author is actually the real descendant of Cotton Mather. The book combines a great story with factual events, leaving you with subtly embedded factual knowledge.The plot contains a whole host of characters that YA readers will love.-The school gang who everyone is afraid of and take an instant dislike to the new girl. (Think Mean Girls)-Two hot young men, though one is a ghost and a few hundred years old.-A feisty protagonist with a smart mouth, who is determined to find out the truth at any cost. One who has confident outer strength, while her inner is less so sure about herself.I read the book in two sittings, one in to the early hours of the morning. There are plenty of twists and turns to keep you interested and a fantastic showdown near the end. Believe me, I did not envisage a certain person being the evil force at play.This is a book that you can fully immerse yourself within.

With medical bills mounting, Vivian sells their NYC apartment and moves them to Salem, Massachusetts. Samantha's grandmother owned a house there before she died, and they can live there while Samantha's father is hospitalized. Immediately, things do not go as planned. As a relative of Cotton Mather, a proponent of the Salem witch trials, local descendants of those killed in the trials take a disliking to her. Strange things begin happening....accidents, injuries, deaths. Samantha has felt cursed all of her life. Maybe it's more than a feeling. Maybe she is actually cursed. With the help of a friendly spirit that only she can see, Samantha works to unravel the mystery causing harm to descendants on both sides of the infamous witch trials. This book is an enjoyable read. The mystery is engaging and the plot moves along at a nice speed. The suspense kept me reading until the very last page. While definitely a YA book dealing with teen social issues alongside the witch trial, history of Salem, etc., the plot is not juvenile. As an adult, I still enjoyed the story. There is no sex, graphic violence or anything that would make this book inappropriate for middle grade aged students through adults. It does have a witchcraft theme...if that isn't your bag, then I'd pass this one by. How to Hang a Witch is the first book in Adriana Mather's series about Samantha Mather.

And just as during the Trials, it's not always the usual suspects who get bullied; it can happen to anyone for any reason. But the only way it happens is if the community supports it. Group agreement and group silence are equally as deadly. The moment someone speaks up, it's possible to stop that cycle. It's not the easiest thing to do, but greatness is never without risk. And there is nothing greater in the whole world than kindness - kindness to someone being bullied, kindness to a stranger, kindness to an inured animal. Every act counts.That paragraph comes from the \"Author's Notes\" section at the end of the book and it is what elevated this read from a solid 4 stars to just shy of 5 stars for me. The author, Adriana Mather, is a descendent of the infamous Cotton Mather. Prior to 1692, there had been rumors of witchcraft in villages neighboring Salem Village and other towns. Cotton Mather, a minister of Boston's North Church, was a prolific publisher of pamphlets, including some that expressed his belief in witchcraft. In his book \"Memorable Providences Relating to Witchcrafts and Possessions\" (1689), Mather describes his \"oracular observations\" and how \"stupendous witchcraft\" had affected the children of Boston and Salem.Here is a picture of the beautiful Adriana with an illustration of Cotton. I can see the family resemblance even though she is by far the more lovely of the two.\nThe story centers around Samantha Mather who is also a descendent of Cotton Mather. She is new in school, she is different, and her family's history in Salem makes her ripe for the picking. This one is highly plot driven and as a consequence some of the characters are flat. However, the story is well written enough and intriguing enough that I can accept that. The genre here is definitely YA and not prose filled thought provoking literature. What sets this book above most books in the supernatural YA field is the message it conveys. The story is extremely interesting and while the plot progressed and layers of the mysteries were peeled back the underlying themes of bullying, acceptance and friendship were ever present. Lastly, I would like to apologize to the designers of the jacket art and the jacket design before I make the following statement. The cover sucks. Consult me next time Ms. Mathers, I am not a designer but I am a prolific reader and I am sure I could have done better than that."}, {"userName": "Max Baker", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15359686-max-baker", "userReview": "Have you ever read a really highly rated book and just know you're going to be in the minority? Because I do, and it's this one. It pained me to read this book, like I was literally regretting sitting down and reading up. But, there was no way I couldn't finish it, because I needed to know exactly what made this such a painful experience. And, honestly, I'm still having a hard time with that question. there are so many elements in How to Hang a Witch that just didn't work. Maybe it's me, but this book was just...bad. But, I have to give credit where credit is due. This book is incredibly well researched. From the Salem Witch Trials to the descriptions of witchcraft in the book, it all felt very authentic. It was clear Mather did a lot of research into the culture and history, which is also her history since Mather is a descendant of Cotton Mather from the actual Witch Trials and writing a YA, maybe-fictionalized-maybe-not-I'm-just-saying, account of her family history is pretty cool. So, I can't say that there's nothing positive about this book.My problems with this book stems from two main points. 1) The Characters. 2) The writing style. This is pitched as a sort of Salem Witch Trials meets Mean Girls kinda thing. A lot of books capitalize on the whole \"hysteria\" thing and the way gossip and fear can take a hold of a community, but this book takes it to a whole new level, linking the Salem Witch Trials to modern day high school, which would be really cool if it were utilized properly.This is very much a character driven story, but there's no character in this story. Sam, Jaxon, Elijah, the Descendants. They're all lifeless shells full of spite, self-hatred, and occasionally funny one-liners when the plot calls for it. Does Sam need to be vulnerable because plot? Yes. Does Lizzie need to do something bitchy, because reasons? Yep, done. Does Susannah/Alice/Mary need to spout some half-assed/half-explained exposition Sam will ignore until the time is right? You betcha. All these characters were puppets, moving because the plot, which is pretty flimsy at best, calls for it. None of them were developed past the point of a vague description and a name. Hell, some of them didn't even have that luxury. Two of the five Descendants were interchangeable, one made an impression because he's a guy and another because she was the only person who actually interacted with Sam outside a few mean comments. And the final Descendant? Guys, I can't believe I'm saying this, but how do you mess up a mean girl? Like seriously? Lizzie, the only \"mean girl\" in the book, is the weakest mean girl I've ever read about. I'd call her a stereotype, but that's stretching it because stereotypes are at least interesting/fun to laugh at. Lizzie was just a shell of a ghost of a stereotype that honestly wasn't in the book for that long. Oh, and there's a love triangle between a hot junior named Jaxson, yes that is how his name is spelled, and a dead ghost who falls in love with Sam named Elijah. And, seriously people? Has our need for a love triangle superseded the fact the love interest has to be alive and not three-hundred years older than the protagonist? Because, if it has, were in some deep shit. And neither of them are interesting. Seriously. Jaxson was a wet blanket and Elijah was a literal ghost whose dialogue was like something out of a bad porno parody of the Salem Witch Trials. It got on my nerves super fast and not only did I not find it authentic, I found it absolutely irritating. And Sam? She's...she's...god, I don't know. I can't cal her a blank slate because she does do stuff, but I can't call her a character because there's almost no personality behind her. She's funny when she has to be, vulnerable when the plot calls for it, and angry when there needs to be a reason for one of her two guys to make her feel better. This entire book is Sam reacting too what happens to her in a way that gives her no agency. She's just a pair of eyes that pretends to have a personality to trick you into thinking it's a real character.Moving on to the writing style, it's too fast. And not necessarily fast paced, but fast writing. The scene changes with a sentence, stuff is discovered and talked about and moved on to new stuff in a paragraph, things just go by too fast. The story is written so tightly there's no room to breathe, no room that would allow the story to grow and build on its own. Something is always happening, Sam is always feeling something or do something it overshadows what she was doing previously. It's disjointed and manic and gave me a huge headache. During the climax, like twelve things were going on and I couldn't focus on anything. I had to re-read like the last twenty-ish pages just to get some handle on the setting and what the hell was going on. There was just too much happening all at once to feel any tension or suspense or fear or whatever I was supposed to be feeling in those moments. And, what's just really really sad, is that this could have been such a good book. It was so well researched it could have been an absolutely phenomenal story about bullying and hysteria and dark family secrets if it just had a better writing style and characters who were interesting/engaging/good. But, instead it turned into a well-researched dreck that made reading it literally painful for me. However, I will probably be reading Mather\u2019s next book, because I really think if she tweaks a few things I could see what other people see in her writing and get on board with what she has to offer."}, {"userName": "Jacqueline", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9659631-jacqueline", "userReview": "3.5/5 starsVideo Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gp2h...This was one of the books I picked up during my BEA/Bookcon trip.

Honestly, after 3/4 of the book I just wanted to finish it and put it away.Part of me wants to say that this was unique, because I have never read a YA book about the Salem Witch Trials (at least not like this one); however, aside from the idea, the rest of the story was completely unoriginal. I felt like the characters were borrowed from other YA novels (you know, those stereotypical personalities), that most of the \"snarky comments\" have already been said, and that the whole love-triangle was too forced. Normally, I don't mind love-triangles - if they're done well - but this one, I hated. I really did. Because I knew exactly who Samantha was going to end up with, and I felt like the author was trying too hard to \"trick\" the reader from thinking that. Unfortunately, she did a bad job, and it just annoyed me that she was trying so hard, when it was painfully obvious.You might be asking how I rated this over 2 stars if it seems like I didn't enjoy it; however, there were a few things I did enjoy.

Sadly, her idea was good, but her execution was poor.Honestly, overall, this was boring and unoriginal. It disheartens me to say that since I was looking forward to reading this. Plus, I already bought the second book in this series...which I'm wondering if I should read it or not. Perhaps another time, since I've heard it's better than this novel.Either way, I'm sure younger audiences would love this! I, on the other hand, have read too many books that follow this exact plot-line and could not enjoy it."}, {"userName": "Brittany (Brittany's Book Rambles)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16373718-brittany-brittany-s-book-rambles", "userReview": "4.5/5 StarsFor ages, I have been looking for that perfect Halloweeny read, and I've finally found it! It's witchy without being too creepy, and being the big scaredy-cat that I am, the latter is extremely important. I'm fascinated and horrified by the history of the Salem witch trials, and How to Hang a Witch uses that history and turns it into a spooky and romantic story. I really identified with the main character's voice, and I now have a new book boyfriend in Elijah\u2014a swoony ghost with a sad and dark past. In a lot of ways, this book reminded me of the movie The Craft, which I loooooved growing up, but a cuter version!Once I got to the middle of the story, I was tearing through the pages! I couldn't get enough of the story and all the romantic scenes were amazing. The book ends in a way that makes you want to rip your hair out\u2014but in a good way haha. When I reached the end, I couldn't believe it. It left me with so many questions and hopes, but I have no idea what's going to happen in the sequel. I needed more, and now I have to wait over a year for the next book!Alas, I will eagerly await the sequel... until I get it, I'll just have to push this book on everyone I know haha.Read my full ARC review of How to Hang a Witch!"}, {"userName": "Korrina  (OwlCrate)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37437502-korrina-owlcrate", "userReview": "This book was fun, but also kind of silly.

I also did not finish this book and quit at the 50 percent mark.The only cool thing about this book is that a descendant of the Mathers (see Salem Witch trials) wrote a book book Salem and what happens when a descendant of Cotton Mather moves to Salem. There appears to be a curse at work on Sam and the Descendants (the book titles them that way, not me) of the supposed witches that were hanged. Other than that, there is not really anything to see here.The world building in this book is not great, we have a love triangle (of course) and the development of the main character and others is non-existent. It does not help that crucial details are being left out of things everywhere you turn and you are just supposed to figure out what is going on. I read to the 50 percent mark due to the chapters being so short. But at that point (Chapter 30 to be exact) I pulled the plug and said forget this noise. There are better books out there and I rather be reading them.The main character of Samantha (prefers Sam) Mather really needs to be worked on. he is not really solid as a character. She is either fighting with her stepmother Vivian, or getting into fights/arguments with teachers or other kids at her school. We keep hearing about terrible things that happened to Sam at schools, but the things described (a hair cutting incident) is assault plain and simple and I have to wonder at Sam's father and stepmother trying to gloss over the whole thing. Of course the book tries to tie in Sam's problems with a \"curse\" and all, but that didn't really work for me since one incident involved a childhood friend and we don't know what happened there, and the second incident was her having her hair cut and once again I don't know what led up to it. The secondary characters are written terribly too. Sam's stepmother Vivian has apparently been in her life since she was a child and up until Sam's father had his accident they were really close. But Sam keeps fighting with Vivian and will not tell her what is going on. So there's just a lot of scenes with Sam acting like a jerk (my words) and then saying I should tell Vivian what's going on. Yeah girl, you should. Other characters such as Jaxon are there to just be a love interest to Sam. I have no idea what this guy really looks like besides the color of his eyes. In fact every guy in this book gets the color of his eyes described. I don't know why Jaxon likes Sam besides the story is making it so. Once again she's not interesting at all, they just live next door to each other.We also get the Descendants of those accused of witchcraft. Why Mather actually decided to make these Descendants actual witches baffles me. Frankly I wonder why the character of Sam has not said to at least one of them, well so my great great great whatever was right? Still a terrible person to have people be hanged, but you all were witches? That whole thing drove me buggy while reading. Also these Descendants all wear black (yes cause witches wear black...always) and they go off into the woods, they have a circle (but the last time I checked I don't think there are 13 of them, but they all started to blur together so don't quote me on that), and they all wear hooded capes or capes when going out into the woods. I just could not stop laughing. These were stereotypical witches that made me roll my eyes a lot. They were also bullies and acted like asses to Sam. I also don't get why any of these kids would bully someone just because their last name was Mather and no one in the school picked up on it at all. Ugh. I will be here all day if I get into this anymore so moving on.The other townspeople are a bit much too. Everytime Sam tells someone their name they freak out. There is an incident when she goes to get coffee and the cashier requests her last name (please) and she says Mather and gets the stink eye from the cashier and others. I mean the incidents like this in the book were ridiculous. The writing was not good. I really don't know what else to say. The sentence structures were all over the place and depending on who was talking it got even more messed up. For example, the character of Elijah should not be speaking in modern speech at all since we know what era he was born in. And having the character speak as if he just learned English was not working for me either. Having the chapter headings started wearing on my nerves while reading too. I don't know why some authors need to set the mood so to speak, but readers are smart, you don't have to have a chapter that says \"Under All that Bravado\" and then have a character say that later on in the chapter. The flow of the book was really bad too. The chapters kept ending at weird places and nothing really synced up. The world building for this book should have been easy. Salem is a real place. I have no understanding at all of how the town looks besides almost all of the houses are black, witches symbols are all over the place, and the school has a witch as their mascot. I also got that same information from Wikipedia. I need to actually be able to envision it. How does the town look, is it a straight route from Sam's house to downtown. How do the trees look? Do the houses have gables? Widows walk? Salem is a huge tourist attraction, this book takes place during September/October, are you telling me there are no tourists anywhere? I have a friend that lives in Boston and she always goes to Salem for Halloween and based on the pictures there are a ton of things to do there. The Salem Sam inhabits seems kind of desolate. I can't speak to the ending because I stopped reading this at 50 percent. I would definitely recommend skipping this."}, {"userName": "Vikki", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11294629-vikki", "userReview": "Spooky. Paranormal. Angsty. I should have read this around Halloween but still read in 2 days (probably would have read in one if not Thanksgiving/family time). Samantha Mather moves to Salem from NYC due to her family's financial situation after her father goes into a mysterious coma. Weird, slightly sinister things seem to have been happening to people around Sam for as long as she remembers and just get worse in Salem. The mystery of the Mathers and the Descendants curse kept me turning the pages. There was the perfect mix of witches, ghosts, premonition, and history/folklore. I loved all the history and back stories that seemed to tie in at the end. I liked that an actual descendant of Cotton Mather actually wrote this book and I felt that she captured the feel of Salem perfectly. I felt like the love triangle didn't need to be there and Sam should have not shut people out/kept quiet about all the weird things happening to her especially at the beginning. Overall, I liked that the moral of the story for the witch trials and modern day bullying were connected at the end and made me think about causes of each and how to prevent both.I gave this 4 out of 5 stars on Goodreads."}, {"userName": "Kali Wallace", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39236664-kali-wallace", "userReview": "I absolutely adore this book. I read it as a manuscript, and I read it as an ARC, and I am going to buy the finished version when it comes out, and I love it more every time. It's so charming and spooky and witchy and twist, and also it features my grumpy ghost boyfriend, who I shall not share with anybody else, even though I understand if everybody comes away from this wanting a ghost boyfriend of their very own. Go find your own. This one is mine.But seriously, more to the point, what a fun ride this is! Witches and ghosts and--well, not so much a haunted house as an entire haunted town--plus creeeeeeeeeeeeeepy magic and a big dose of history that never feels heavy-handed, all wrapped up in the story about the thoroughly wonderful and believable teenage Sam who just wants her beloved father to be well and her new life in a new town not to not suck so much, what with its bullies and mean girls and unhelpful teachers and difficult parents and, oh, also the ghosts. It's a wonderfully fresh take on witchcraft and the legacy of Salem. I'm very much looking forward to the sequel to see what other folklore and history Adriana Mather decides to explore!"}, {"userName": "Samantha", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22840462-samantha", "userReview": "I knew, going into this book, that I would probably like it. I've been forever fascinated by the Salem witch trials, and knowing the book was written by a descendant of Cotton Mather added an extra bit of depth and definitely peaked my curiosity. But I more than liked it. I LOVED this story. It's smart and funny, sweet and sad, scary and tense. I kept turning the pages because I needed to know what was going to happen next. Adriana Mather brings us to modern day Salem with Sam (never Samantha) and her stepmom as they're forced to move into Sam's grandmother's house while her dad lies in a coma in a nearby hospital. Being a descendant of Cotton Mather--the man who is often cited for his support of the Salem witch trials--makes Sam an instant outcast at school. She's plagued by a group of girls calling themselves the Descendants (who happen to be descendants of the so-called witches from the infamous trials), and they decide it's their task to make Sam's life at school hell. To top it off, Sam has a pesky ghost boy problem back at home. This story is woven together so well, I barely stopped to take a breath. But when I did, I was taken by how the author managed to parallel modern day high school bullying with the Salem trials themselves. We still hang people without justifiable cause today, even if it doesn't appear to take the same shape or form. We are quick to judge and ostracize, just like they did in the 1690s, and we hang others through vicious words, social media, and by making them outcasts. The fact that the story reverses the roles--a Mather now being \"hanged\" by the witches--just highlights this fact even more. Even the victims can become the villains, given enough time and hatred. That's what makes this book so relevant. Not only is it entertaining, it's important. And all of this is just the meat of the story. Within it all, we have gorgeous scenery, adorable boys, and gut-wrenching heartache. I laughed, I cried. I read it twice because I wanted to make sure I didn't miss anything. And I forecast at least another reading or two in my future. Definitely one of my favorite recent reads. This is a fantastic debut, and it solidifies Adriana Mather as a YA author worthy of watching."}, {"userName": "Colleen Houck", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1163228-colleen-houck", "userReview": "I loved this take on the Salem witch trials and comparing it with modern day bullying.

For one, I don't really have the time. Two, if I really loved a book I'm afraid rereading it will make me not like it as much. I reread How to Hang a Witch because I wanted the characters and the world fresh in my mind as I went into the second installment. I think this is the first time I can honestly say that I enjoyed the book more the second time I read it. Our main chatacter is Sam. She just moved to her parents home town, Salem, Mass., with her step-mother because her father is in a coma and his medical bills made it impossible for them to keep their apartment in New York. Sam and her step-mother move in to a house that was left to her dad by his mother, the grandmother Sam never got to meet. Aside from finding out that her grandmother left the house for her dad, sam also finds out that her last name is something that could get her killed.Sam starts school and that is when everything starts to unravel. There is a group of mean girls, The Decendents, that start torturing Sam instantly. And, of course her being the new girl, the teachers blame her for everything. This part of the book disgusted me. Telling Sam to watch her temper when she is literally being BEYOND bullied just set me off. I hate when there are unfair circumstances the main character has to get through with a smile. There is one reprieve for Sam and that comes in the form of Jaxon. Sam is very suspicious of Jaxon because everyone else treats her like a disease and he is all up in her business. This causes her to push him away every chance she gets. But he isn't so easily swayed. It helps that he is her neighbor and his mother is always inviting Sam over for random things. And his mother happens to be her dads childhood best friend.Oh, and Elijah. But you will meet him yourself. I don't want to spoil him for you!It turns out that there might be a curse on the families of the first Salem Witch Trials decendents and as soon as Sam arrives people start dropping like flies. Trying to solve this curse is where the reader gets a lot more of the historical stand-point of the book. I loved the historical parts and I would really love to read more about it. I don't considering myself someone who really likes history but certain things I can really get sucked in to.This book had a much deeper meaning subject than just the Salem Witch Trials. It also took on the task of showing the reader how bullying is a vicious cycle and it isn't just something that happens among school-age kids. The book shows us that we have to end the cycle of bullying in order for us to have peace. If we just keep our heads down or ignore it, it will no go away and you are just as guilty as the bully if you don't say something. Silence is killer. I adore how the author fit that into the book and I hope people actually notice it.In the end, I was both sad and happy for Sam. She might have lost someone she was close to but she got someone else back. I know she will have a lot of stuff to work through given the amount of information that was thrown at her about her mother and father and step-mother and just everything that happened at the end. I really enjoyed Sam as a character. She was put under so much stress and had to handle so many insane situations but she was still very mature about it all.

Recently transplanted from New York City, Sam and her stepmother are not exactly welcomed with open arms. Sam is the descendant of Cotton Mather, one of the men responsible for those trials and almost immediately, she becomes the enemy of a group of girls who call themselves The Descendants. And guess who their ancestors were?If dealing with that weren't enough, Sam also comes face to face with a real live (well technically dead) ghost. A handsome, angry ghost who wants Sam to stop touching his stuff. But soon Sam discovers she is at the center of a centuries old curse affecting anyone with ties to the trials. Sam must come to terms with the ghost and find a way to work with The Descendants to stop a deadly cycle that has been going on since the first accused witch was hanged. If any town should have learned its lesson, it's Salem.
