I was starting 6th grade. I finished the whole series in a week (yes, I skipped a few chapters and the majority of New Moon & Breaking Dawn). I don't know about anyone else, but I like my male characters to act... I don't know... manly? Not like some possessive, always depressed, stick-up-his-ass glittery fairy princess. He wasn't a man to me, I couldn't picture him as a man. No matter how hard I tried, I pictured some girl with red hair and obsessive personality disorder. Bella... I named my dog Bella just because I disliked her so much. She was spineless, depressed, and treated herself like a \"little woman\". I found that the only character I liked was Rosalie and that was because she hated Bella. And, on top of all that, she described Edward as \"perfect\". Hate to break it to you, sweetie, I don't care what he is - no one is perfect.I hated the shoddy writing and lack of plot. I honestly could've made a drinking game out of the book: How many times does Bella say Edward is attractive, someone says an asinine line, and how many times I wanted to chuck the book in the trash.The characters were static and very annoying to read, the plot in all four books could be described in one short sentence, the writing was shoddy, and it didn't convey a good message (no, \"I would become a vampire for the guy I just met\" and \"always date crazy-obsessive people\" doesn't count.).Honestly, as a fellow writer, I wrote a better story at 11 than this. Wanna read good vampire books? Look at these: Vampire Academy & Morganville Vampires.

Okay, so it wasn't like I immediately jumped the vampire bandwagon and started sticking posters of a shirtless Taylor Lautner all over my bedroom walls, but I DID think that it was a great series.Well, it's not a BAD series either. It's good the first time around; then you read it again and you realize how annoying all the characters are. The best thing I can say about it is that the action scenes (the very, very minimal action scenes) weren't all that bad.In all honesty, it could have been a good story if it wasn't Meyer who wrote it. Bella really grated on my nerves. She spends the majority of the first few chapters whining about living in Forks (if she sent HERSELF there I don't know why she's complaining so much, she can only blame herself), and describing herself as \"non-athletic, slender but soft, with clear and translucent skin\". That's kind of ridiculous; don't get me started on the fact that ALL human skin is technically translucent. Bella insists she's not pretty, yet no less than three guys immediately jump in to flirt with her in awkward high school ways, and from what Edward said, \"that's not what every single male in the school was thinking\".If that isn't a shout-out to all Mary Sue traits, then I don't know what is.Bella spends half of every book swooning and gushing over his goregeous, angel-like model looks, worrying over how plain she is next to him, and how he's so rich and it makes her feel awkward. Yet she reacts with hostility towards Jacob when he mentions this and says she loves him, not his looks or money. Right, Bella.Edward himself is an unlikeable hero. He's abusive, extremely posessive, and has stalker-like tendencies, not to mention the fact that every single vampire is basically a Mary Sue/Gary Stu all on their own. He is so perfect, he doesn't even react negatively when Bella admits she loves another man. I'm sorry, but ... no. Just no. I have no words for this.Besides the outrageously perfect characters, you would think a series filled with bloodlusting vampires and tension between werewolves would be full of action or at LEAST a punch or two somewhere. Meyer gave us several hundred pages of suspense in the last book, only to completely destroy our expectations when the heroes solve their problems with the Volturi ... by talking. This book clearly needs to win \"The Most Anticlimatic Ending Ever\" award.At several points in the series Meyer attempted to use long, difficult words to make the book more adult, probably with the hope that tween girls would skip them rather than run to the dictionary, because most of those words were used incorrectly and in the wrong context. This itself is one problem I cannot ignore. All authors should have this unspoken rule: \"If you don't know what it means, for heaven's sakes don't use it!\"I don't want to rain on anybody's parade, but my opinion still stands firm. This series is, while perfectly for fine for girls wanting PG13-level sexual tension and an entire cast of sexy, gorgeous, shirtless people, go ahead. But when the story destroys all vampire cliches in the worst way possible (sparkles? Seriously?) and takes a REAL Indian tribe and completely ruins their entire history, it goes just a little too far."}, {"userName": "Bethany Lois", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21701516-bethany-lois", "userReview": "Book 1: Twilight (The Twilight Saga, Book 1) by Stephenie Meyer. Keeping in mind the target audience and not expecting great literary depth, I highly enjoyed the book. The depth of love between the main characters is a bit unsupported and unbelievable in the first book, but it is a fantasy after all. 5 starsBook 2: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) by Stephenie Meyer. My least favorite of the 4 books. I felt like Bella was slow to come to conclusions I'd come to early on in the book. It was a bit frustrating to wait out. If this book disappoints, hang in there, the 4th is by far the best. 3 StarsBook 3: Eclipse (The Twilight Saga, Book 3) by Stephenie Meyer. The next chapter, a lot more action in this one. This book had a few more twists and turns and is able to go into so much more depth due to the background knowledge of the first 2 books. 4 stars.Book 4: Breaking Dawn (The Twilight Saga Book 4) by Stephenie Meyer. By far the best of the 4 books. Felt more lengthy compared to the first 3 with so much more story packed into the book. This book could easily have been split into two. Probably why the movie was split into two parts. They read my mind. :) More character development and some twists and turns. 5 stars."}, {"userName": "Ivana", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1058641-ivana", "userReview": "Nothing beats the amazing franchise that is The Twilight Saga. Though we all have an image of what Edward and Bella look like if we were to read it now but it still doesn't take away from the glorious vampiric world that Stephenie Meyer created. However there are a select group out there who read this before the big film adaptations came along. Before the days of Pattinson and Stewart and Lautner. Before Team Edward and Team Jacob though that was around in its own way. The beauty of reading it before the casting was you had your own idea of what the characters looked like and that is the great thing about books. You have your imagination to take you into these worlds. For me, I was entranced from Page of 1 of the first Twilight book about this meek, clumsy girl named Bella (told in first perspective so I immediately projected myself into Bella and saw the world through her eyes) and the day she encountered that mysterious and charming man that would change her life forever. The beautiful Edward Cullen. The journey of these two through four books and the supporting characters is just phenomenal and I loved it. Not a bad word about any of the books. Though I was greatly saddened to see the end and to read the last ever page. It was like taking a long awaited breath and seeing the rollarcoaster ride you took. It was sad to end but it was time.So if you haven't read it, shame on you.

The books were jolly good page turners. I initially thought that it was interesting how Bella was presented as just an ordinary teenage girl with nothing really special about her. The best bits of the books were linked to mythology and Native American legends; these stories were very compelling.***warning - spoilers below***What was interesting about the saga too was the subtext to the vampiric imagery of sex and consumption. Edward is the gallant hero who must exercise self-control, an old fashioned figure from another age, but there is something rather disturbing about the potential that he always has to hurt Bella. This is a little reminiscent of the old myth about domestic violence - \"he never meant to hurt me\" - which is brought out disturbingly when Bella and Edward finally have sex in the final book, Breaking Dawn. There are many examples like this throughout the saga, e.g. Bella punches Jacob and breaks her hand. The threat of violence and violation seems to crop up a great deal in the books from the first novel where Bella is nearly raped by a group of human men, to the rape revenge story of the vampire Rosalie's origins."}, {"userName": "Lasaki Redbird", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18557947-lasaki-redbird", "userReview": "the series were okay and were moving in a way. but to be honest i HATED bella swan. she is like the worst character ever made, both in movies and in books. she is given a lot of attention by author, more than she deserves, i mean like come on, a normal backward girl who is not assertive and not the \"beautifullest\" or outgoing is chased by allot of handsome hunks? seriously? if people would be asking alice out, or even rosalie, take at least jennifer who are far more mixing and awesome than this lame girl.

I know there are many people out there who have called the entire saga stupid, and there are many parts of each of these books (and especially the movies) where I could see where they were coming from. I would also never claim that Bella Swan/Cullen is in any way the best fictional role model for girls. But it is entertaining, and kind of romantic. I think Breaking Dawn is the very best of the four volumes, and Renesmee, the daughter of Edward and Bella, is a cute little half-human, half vampire kid. Vampire Bella, as opposed to human Bella is also pretty intense. The Twilight Saga, while not a thing to be taken seriously (and will never be as good a fantasy tale as Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, or the Chronicles of Narnia), is still an entertaining wish fulfillment saga with a supernatural twist, which is just what it's supposed to be."}, {"userName": "Rhonda", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6337144-rhonda", "userReview": "I'll be honest.

I finally broke down and read the series (If I hadn't seen the terrible movies first I probably would have read them sooner. The movies are sooooo much worse) and I'll admit that I read it straight through and then promptly turned back to book 1 read the whole series again a second time. I also read all of the extras and the unfinished bit of her re-write of the first book from Edwards perspective, which is better than the original!The books get progressively better in quality from 1-4. The first two generally drive me insane and the last two I like better, the writing does improve as well, but it isn't even as good as Rowling. I think she's better than Paolini's first book or two, but his writing improved as well. Unfortunately the series ends feeling rather unfinished, kind of as if Rowling had ended HP on the 5th or 6th book and Meyer's is being a bit of a jerk about not finishing the rewrite of the first book ala Edward POV because it was leaked. All her diehard fans are chomping at the bit to buy it and she's whining about it being leaked! But I digress.The concepts in Twilight are interesting, well at least some of them. I really enjoy her whole werewolf/Native American bit and some things about the vampires were interesting. I enjoyed the different, species of vampires (the Romanians vs. the Italians etc.), I think tying in the succubus/incubus thing was neat, I really like the side characters, like Jasper and Alice. Jacob was nice when he wasn't being really annoying. I enjoyed Renesme and all that. I like the conflict between the different powers in the vampire world, etc, but all of that is offset by horribly annoying things.Myers has huge theory holes that bug the crap out of me, such as if they can't wear contacts very long because their tears dissolve the contacts and generally all bodily fluids have some sort of toxicity then how things like kissing, and... other things don't generally cause havoc is beyond me. That's only one example too. I'd have to keep a running tally as I read to get them all down, but this is something I nit pick about when I read.As for the relationship betwteen Bella and Edwards, that's what really gets me because it's freaking ridiculous! And it's teaching young susuptible girls that, among other things, a guy who breaks into your room to watch you sleep is romantic. Really that's what bugs me about the series the most is that Edward's and Bella's and even Jacob's behavior is not only really annoying and unrealistic, but it's now what every Twilight Tweenie Bopper fan (and some ladies too) want. I know some people disagree with me on that, heck I disagree with people that Harry Potter is going to turn the younger generation to Satanism, but it's a lot easier for someone to \"fall in love\" with a controlling stalker than it is for them to get into real black magic. However, I don't think it'd be a problem for those who have a firm grasp on what is fantasy and how stupid, detrimental, and dangerous some of the behavior in this book would be in real life.Still, for all it's faults, the book plays straight to those deep dark (or not so deep and dark) fantasies and day dreams that girls have (and perhaps some guys too) and that makes the whole thing a lot like crack. That's what it really is, emotional crack. What girl hasn't thought herself the Plain Jane and dreamed of a handsom boy who has a dark side but is really sweet finding her and becoming utterly devoted to her? That's what Twilight's basic premis is. It makes you feel warm and fuzzy (when the vampires aren't ripping each other apart) and it makes you sigh wistfully and cry a time or two when you're not laughing your head off because Meyers once again used the phrase \"alabaster brow\" (which for me conjures up visions of Anne of Green Gable's ridiculous stories about Counts and Damsels!) or Edward is currently sparkling in the sun like a melodramatic emo kid who rolled in elmer's glue and glitter.So in summary... Twilight is crack and you're either an open addict, a closet addict, a recreational user, a guilty pleasure user, or a hater.I fall somewhere between guilty pleasure and hater, but most times I play on the Team Wooden Steak side since most everybody drools over it and thinks it's so serious. I also have a bit of a grudge against it because it has forever ruined the names Edward and Jacob, both of which I adore and can no longer really use for any pets or kids or characters of my own."}, {"userName": "Sally", "userReviewDate": "Dec 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2616331-sally", "userReview": "#1 - Twilight. Phoenix girl (Bella) moves to Forks in Washington state to live with her divorced dad. Falls in love with Edward who she discovers is a vampire. I had a hard time with this book, it was easy to read, but I did not like the weak female lead (Bella) who had to be saved numerous times contrasted with the super-everything-vampire.To be fair, the idea of turning the vampire myths on its head was great! So while not the best book in the series, I didn't dislike it enough to make me stop reading!#2 New Moon. Edward's vampire family puts Bella in danger so he decides to leave. Bella is befriended by Jacob who it turns out is a werewolf - the sworn enemy of vampires. Conceptually the problem for me with this novel is two-fold. First, that someone has a secret and Bella has to use her wits to figure it out herself (sort of like Book 1 but with Jacob instead of Edward). It felt like a repeat to me. Secondly, that she would put herself in danger just to \"hear\" Edwards voice, it was difficult to accept. I think the last section of the book with the Volturi was very entertaining and redeemed the book in my eyes.#3 Eclipse. Jacob and Edward team up to protect Bella against a common enemy - a vampire who wants to take revenge on Edward for killing her mate, by killing Bella.I found this book entertaining because it showed up some of the rivalry between Jacob and Edward for Bella's affections and how they worked together for Bella. I enjoyed this book more than the first two, and by this time, I accepted the fact that Edward was so noble.#4 Breaking Dawn. Edward and Bella get married, have a half human-half half-vampire child with special abilities and ***spoiler*** Edward changes Bella into a vampire as she is dying. Bella also has a special ability as a vampire and is able to protect her family.I enjoyed the wrapup to the series immensely. I didn't really enjoy the birth scene, and I wish some of the tension around meeting the Volturi was enhanced/extended. However, the series had a happy ending.While no literary series, the story was very entertaining. In hindsight, adult me finds it hard to stomach a female protagonist who gets into trouble all the time and has to be saved. If however, I was reading this as a teen/young adult, then I probably would have fully embraced the idea of love knowing no bounds and the idea that an ordinary person could attract such an extraordinary being. And by the way, I don't how many ways there are to say someone is perfect (Edward), but the author sure tried."}, {"userName": "Jana", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5351829-jana", "userReview": "First, I have absolutely no problem with the people that like/love these books. Anything that gets people to read more is a plus for me. This is my (brief) opinion over the four books, which I've combined here (I could discuss them in more depth, but I'm behind on my reviews, so I'll keep it short.) This is just my opinion. This more or less applies to the series as a whole. I had no idea what I was getting into when I picked up this plotless book full of stereotypes (particularly the character that represents the author herself). If vampires are so good and sparkly, why wouldn't everyone that knows about them want to be turned into a vampire? Edward hints at a reason in the first book or two (possible loss of soul) but it's never followed through. So what is the downside? Why not rid the world of the human race and all be sparkly vampires or werewolves (or some type of bizarre hybrid.) So unless you are of the werewolf tribe, why not be turned? Super strength, beauty, poise and grace, etc --Plus they get supernatural powers! Yes, I've read the entire series (mainly to know what my students were reading, but also to see just how bad it would get). The second one (when Edward leaves over a papercut) taught me I, a female, am nothing without a man, particularly one that sneaks in and just watches me sleep. Ridiculous. After Nessie is born, it seems like Bella and Edward are too busy with, uhm, recreational activities to take care of her. So I guess being a nanny is the sole point of Rosalie's character (other than to be one more person that is jealous of special snowflake Bella and to be a mate for an irresistible Cullen.)Let's gather everyone for a giant battle that, rather anticlimactically, never takes place. Why? To show how special Bella is, I guess. Positive: That was certainly a unique way to solve a love triangle without any long term broken hearts. I've read a lot, and I can't say I've seen that one used before."}, {"userName": "Megan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6414008-megan", "userReview": "The entire Twilight Saga was a great series. My favorite was the first book because it is all about how they met and I just find it the most interesting. I think the theme throughout all of the books was love and sacrafice. Of course in each book they have other small themes. In the first book one theme would be everlasting love, because Bella falls in love with Edward even though he is a vampire. And in the third book a theme could be Good vs Bad because the Cullens try to kill all the bad vampires. I think the subject of the book was to show that anyone can fall in love. I think that Stephanie Meyer wrote this book because she wanted to write a love story but with an unusual twist. It was mainly to entertain. These books were an overall success because they have been made into million dollar movies and are a household name. I think Stephanie Meyer is a great author. I don't believe she has written any other books but I know as a matter of fact that they would be good. She has great abilities as an author. She uses great discription. She uses foreshadowing and she even leaves you hanging a couple of times. According to some reviews of her books people say that her books are highly entertaing and that it is very easy to become engrossed in them. When you start reading them you completely forget about what's going on around you and just want to finish the book. It is also so intriguing because it is not your typical love story. It is between two different creatures. People also like how it is always in a first person point of view. All together I thouroly enjoyed this book series and would read anything like it again.

I respect the ideals of virginity and marriage so much, props to Meyers.Still, I think that the books could have been achieved with far less trees executed.

But again, the Twilight Saga is still an unforgettable story that in fact all people; teenagers or adults alike will always remember as the saga that started the frenzy of fiction books coming to life! :D"}, {"userName": "Kris Purtle", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30384885-kris-purtle", "userReview": "Although I'm not sure that this is the best written story, it is still a good read. While I find Bella to be such a wimp, and so in need of a man, at such a young age, it is still a beautiful story of love. Such a triangle of love, as young Bella is torn between two men, who wrap her into a world of the supernatural. She's in love with Edward, the vampire, and can't seem to be able to live without him. But, she's also in love with Jacob, the wolf. Though, her love for him isn't like her love for Edward. My biggest grip about this whole saga is the imprinting on a baby. I know that it isn't sexual, in nature, but it still felt wrong to have the story go in that direction. Though, it was the one way to keep Jacob in Bella's life, forever. To allow their friendship to continue, without all the hurt and drama. I have read MANY fanfiction stories, from the Twilight series, and have found several to actually be better written than the original by Stephenie Meyer."}, {"userName": "Madison", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8164205-madison", "userReview": "I had a YA Literature professor who reffered to some books as \"potato chip books\". Meaning that, they taste really good, you cant put them away, and you always hunger for more. But once you have finished the \"chip bag\" so to speak, you didnt really get any nutrients out of it.Thats how I felt about this series. Its crazy addicting, and I loved it. Its one of the first series of books I ever completed. I read each one of them in a day or two.I always want to go back for more, but at the end of the day, when the series is finished... I learned nothing from reading these books. Except for that if Stephenie Meyer is right about vampires, then we are all in trouble bc they seem pretty undefeatable. Unless you are friends with a warewolf, are dating one of the few veggie-vamps, have a collection of highly explosive weapons, or if your blood smells horrible. oh, I also learned that Bella hearts Edward."}, {"userName": "Carla Harris", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27015464-carla-harris", "userReview": "This is the second time I've read this complete seriesThe first time as for many I had to wait for each book to come out...waiting to see what Bella would do and hoping that she would choose Jacob (yes I was team Jacob, who wouldn't want a warm wolf to cuddle with)....This time there was no waiting and I the outcome....but it was like reading them all new again...I could not stop...I read the first in a day...the next one in a day...the third one in day and half and the last one took me two days....Bree I was done almost before she began...My friends were back...I so wish I had gotten the Harry Potter series on my kindle....it makes so worth reading again....and I am sure without a doubt in a year I will be reading this series again.Stephanie you have made these people so real they are like family....Thank you"}, {"userName": "Suri Hiro", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28866295-suri-hiro", "userReview": "You can read my reviews of each book separately:Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse, Breaking Dawn, & The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner.*Not impressed.

I reread afterwards and felt incredibly stupid. Her writing is not nearly at the level I appreciate most and I felt guilty for calling her amazing. I could rant about her needing to go back to school to learn how to use proper imagery, being contradicting, and favoring emotionally abusive relationships (Yes, I count being constantly told by the 'love of your life' that you're not wanted as emotionally abusive), but it's kind of a waste of my time. The love-sick fans will probably get all pissy at me, others may or may not understand until they read it themselves, and I can't force people to change their opinions. Because after all, all these reviews are opinions and those should be respected even if one disagrees."}], "description": "This stunning set, complete with five editions of Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse, Breaking Dawn, and The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner: An Eclipse Novella, makes the perfect gift for fans of the bestselling vampire love story.Deeply romantic and extraordinarily suspenseful, The Twilight Saga capture the struggle between defying our instincts and satisfying our desires.", "title": "The Twilight Saga Complete Collection\n      \n          (Twilight  #1-4, 3.5)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8726744-the-twilight-saga-complete-collection", "average": 4.33, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388184702l/8726744.jpg", "reviews": 371, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/941441.Stephenie_Meyer", "name": "Stephenie Meyer"}], "type": ["Fantasy", "Paranormal", "Fantasy", "Romance", "Shapeshifters"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8726744-the-twilight-saga-complete-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9648544-the-twilight-saga-complete-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9261904-the-twilight-saga-complete-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13013742-the-twilight-saga-complete-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41865.Twilight", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/428263.Eclipse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49041.New_Moon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1162543.Breaking_Dawn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1656001.The_Host", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19755140-embassytown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32858845-off-to-be-the-wizard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10931746-the-stepford-wives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13604418-the-long-earth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34111309-the-man-of-legends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193375-fellside", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204943-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18806963-prayers-to-broken-stones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18126623-2061", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29425329-alas-babylon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193696-3001", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18162904-dreams-and-shadows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35106805-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25353286-provenance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23249416-an-unwelcome-quest"]}
