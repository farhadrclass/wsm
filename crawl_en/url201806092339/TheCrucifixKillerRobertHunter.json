With a mix of bloodthirsty crime and detective work this book keeps you guessing until the last minute. I actually did not pick the eventual killer like I am apt to do in many novels.Robert Hunter and his new partner Carlos Garcia are assigned to a murder case in Los Angeles. A particularly horrific murder has been committed and, at first, it appears to be the work of just some new type of weird sadistic individual.In the course of his detective work, Hunter begins to draw parallels to a previous, and world-renowned, case of his - The Crucifix Killer. But that killer was caught and executed although Hunter was not at all satisfied with the outcome and perhaps now he will pay the price. The more he and Garcia delve into this new murder and the seedy side of Los Angeles, the more his is convinced that there is a copycat murderer active. Yes, this is a well-worn script in popular crime novels yet all I will say is that Robert Hunter is wrong.I raced through this book, such a well-written novel with a tight plot but only one area stopped it short of a five-star read. For me, the ending was a little too much like the wrapping up of a half hour TV crime show. The scene where Hunter and the killer face off - there is too much telling and boasting from the killer and it is a bit of an easy way out in terms of opening the plot up to the reader. I do not mind the final face-off, always a necessity really but would have preferred there was more explained during the detective work rather than the egotistical killer spruiking their work at the end. However, that being said, the book was well good enough to not drop below a four -star read and I have no hesitation in recommending. Not the best for those with a weak stomach, however."}, {"userName": "Mandy", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18318291-mandy", "userReview": "This is the first in a series, the main character being Detective Robert Hunter. He works in Los Angeles in the Robbery and Homicide Division.When a body is discovered Robert soon realises that this case bears similarities to a case he had worked two years before, when a serial killer took the lives of seven people before Robert and his partner caught him, and the killer was executed. Now it seems, he's back.The killings are described quite graphically, and at times some of the scenes can be quite hard to read.That being said, I did really enjoy this book. It was fast-paced, very much plot driven, and I read it quickly. I found that I was rooting for the detectives and wanted to keep reading in order to find out what would happen.The writing was perfect for the book. Straightforward, no nonsense that was easy for me to digest and keep reading. Just the way I like it when I read a thriller.I will read others in this series, and already have the second book from the library."}, {"userName": "Erika", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/232162-erika", "userReview": "Robert Hunter works for the Robbery & Homicide Department in Los Angeles, California and remembers well the serial murders that started two years ago. The kills seemed random, but gruesome; victims were tortured and left to die with only one clue to tie them all to the same killer: an odd double crucifix symbol carved in the back of their necks. With clean crime scenes and no other identifying trademarks, the media and police nicknamed the murderer \u201cThe Crucifix Killer.\u201d Thinking RHD had caught the right man, a trial was set and a man was found guilty and killed. But Hunter and his partner knew better. Unable to prove their misgivings despite a confession, the two were forced to move forward with their guilt. Hunter suffered nightmares, his partner and wife were soon after killed in a boating accident.With his partner\u2019s death and the crucifix killings still fresh, Hunter receives a new partner and together they investigate a new murder scene with familiar repercussions. On the victim\u2019s neck is the double crucifix mark he remembers well from a couple of years earlier, but is it the same killer or a copycat? A phone call and familiar voice bring back chilling memories and confirm Hunter\u2019s suspicions: the Crucifix Killer is back.Chris Carter\u2019s The Crucifix Killer opens to a disturbing scene as Hunter receives a phone tip from what we can only then assume is the killer. He rushes to a revealed location and finds his partner, Garcia, tied and hung onto poles and we wonder, will Hunter be able to save him in time? The rest of the book fills in the five weeks prior to this moment, but unfortunately do little else.Carter\u2019s writing is far from poetic. His narrative is more instructive and devoid of emotion and character development, as if the entire book was an exercise in showing off Carter\u2019s knowledge of criminal psychology. He does a lot of the dreaded \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell\u201d with numerous character portraits that give away information that\u2019s less than crucial to our understanding of them as tools in the story. With so much condensed back story for each character, I felt Carter was pushing too hard for the reader to gain any actual insight into their psyche (as if we\u2019ve all graduated with degrees in criminal psychology and like Hunter can pull pertinent information from someone\u2019s hair and eye color, occupation, or childhood). Instead their histories were awkward, placed as if Carter couldn\u2019t imagine leaving this useless information out of the book however misplaced it looked.The bad dialogue only added to the disappointing caricatures of a cast of characters derived from Hollywood-inspired stereotypes. One character touts the correctness of using the term \u201cBlack\u201d over anything else, but in this weak effort to promote some type of politically correct agenda, Carter\u2019s characters nevertheless fall victim to his own preconceived notions of what it means to be \u201cBlack\u201d or Puerto Rican. Since I read a proof copy, I\u2019m refraining from using actual quotes, but am particularly confused about the way he portrayed people of color. In one scene Hunter and Garcia dismiss the possibility that Cubans or Puerto Ricans could ever listen to anything other than salsa or meringue music. He also gives a Puerto Rican free use of the very Mexican slang term \u201cese.\u201d Blacks (Carter\u2019s term) in this book also frequently use the word \u201cnigga\u201d--as if it\u2019s a cultural requirement or makes one appear tougher and so must be used by someone expected to appear so.None of the characters or relationships have any depth to them. After going on a couple of dates with Isabella, an awkward construction of sexuality and girlish giggling, Hunter quickly loses interest with her as fast as I lost interest in both him and the plot. The writing is choppy and blundering, the men drunkards and the women either prostitutes or wives, and the twist ending was a clich\u00e9. While the cover image was disturbing and the premise intriguing, the overuse of quick and easy dialogue, gestures, and scenarios cheapened what could have been a phenomenally scary read (what I was expecting). To make matters worse, the most vital pieces of information aren\u2019t revealed to the reader in any way throughout the narrative and are instead contrived into the final pages of the book as Hunter works within his and Carter\u2019s head to piece together clues the reader would never be able to figure out on their own. The presumed insult to the reader, robbing them of not just the satisfaction of figuring it all out on their own, but the ability to do so, is a huge let down.Carter uses a lot of odd phrasing to encompass facial expressions and tones of voice that clearly make sense only to him. I\u2019m also left confused as to the type of In & Out restaurant Carter refers to when he mentions waitresses and a dessert menu. I\u2019m from California, I have an In & Out in my city and it\u2019s a fast food joint. The only thing available for dessert are smoothies; employees do not come out from behind the counter to ask how your meal is going, they clean the tables, seats, floors, and bathrooms. They may even bring your bagged or trayed food to your table. That is it. Maybe someone in LA can let me know if these vastly different chains of In & Out actually exist there, leaving the rest of us sorely deprived?Before this book, I already knew I wasn\u2019t a fan of crime fiction, and I don\u2019t recommend this to people who are unless they want a quick clich\u00e9d read filled with cheap thrills and cardboard characters. If you don\u2019t mind being preempted in the thought process and having everything laid out before you, this might be the book for you. I was disappointed."}, {"userName": "Tonkica", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21285672-tonkica", "userReview": "Odmah me podsjetilo na film \"Sedam\", tako da bih rekla da tu nije bilo ne\u0161to ekstra novo.

I don't think someone killing for revenge would perform such gruesome, torturous, and sadistic acts on their victims.2.

Hunter was initially written as a prodigy, a gifted child, a genius. But he wasn't portrayed as a very smart detective.6. There are basic language problems in this book. Padding someone on the back, instead of patting. Hire a house. Bread dispenser. Someone resides in a street instead of on. Inappropriate use of gotta, wanna, gonna, ain't.

This is something I would really rather not do. However Chris Carter is a genius, in terms of the horror he creates and the way he builds up humanity with the poor murder victims. I had no choice. I started with An Evil Mind and I am Death. I am now back to beginning to the very first story, The Crucifix Killer.This is very much a debut novel. We are introduced to the great Robert Hunter and his methods. Hunter is an expert in psychology, who is working within the police and tackling the really horrific crimes on his patch. He was a child genius. You know the sort; a real clever clogs, with letters to his name. He is a nice chap though. He is joined by a new sidekick, Garcia. A man has been executed via the death penalty and it looks like they got the wrong culprit. Identical macabre crimes are being committed once again. The Crucifix Killer has returned. Will Hunter get to the truth this time?Although I guessed the identity of the killer fairly easily, I loved it. I do read A LOT of crime, which makes me a Miss Marple in the making. I am very easily suspicious of characters who behave in \u2018certain\u2019 ways. I am being deliberately cryptic here. I don\u2019t want to give the game away.

Chris Carter has obviously grown massively as a writer as the books further down this series are a lot stronger and better written than this one. Despite that, this is still a very entertaining read with the usual grotesque killing style of a serial killer that Chris is known for. When the body of a young woman is discovered in a derelict cottage in the middle of Los Angeles National Forest, Homicide Detective Robert Hunter finds himself entering a horrific and recurring nightmare. Naked, strung from two parallel wooden posts, the victim was sadistically tortured before meeting an excruciatingly painful death. All the skin has been ripped from her face - while she was still alive. On the nape of her neck has been carved a strange double-cross: the signature of a psychopath known as the Crucifix Killer. But that's impossible. Because two years ago, the Crucifix Killer was caught and executed. Could this therefore be a copycat killer? Or could the unthinkable be true?A big aspect of Chris's books that I like is he is not scared to get a bit gory and graphic with his torture and kill scenes, you also can't go wrong with Robert Hunter, kind of a psychological profiler genius come tough cop that is a highly likeable character all around. I have absolutely loved him through this series. The weaknesses in this book I believe just come from lack of experience and I would not let it put you off at all, but promise me you will keep reading the rest of the series to grow with the characters and the writing. Actual rating is 3.5 stars. The beginning point of the journey of Robert Hunter and his never-ending quest to capture the most heinous of killers ever.

Chris Carter's debut novel first published in 2009 introducing LA homicide detective Robert Hunter who is chasing a brutal serial killer. I liked the characters, in particular Hunter and his rookie partner Garcia. Some issues with pacing and authenticity but quite entertaining and considering this was a debut, not bad. Audiobook released February 2017 with excellent narration by Thomas Judd (not available in the US)."}, {"userName": "Monnie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6277675-monnie", "userReview": "As I've mentioned before, I'm always on the lookout for a good series; these books make great fill-ins when I want a break from tackling my ever-growing list of free-for-review books and standalones from favorite authors that I read just because, well, they're from my favorite authors. Besides that, I'm hoping to find a series that will appeal to my husband, who loves to read the same types of books I do but, for better or worse, is much harder to please.When a Goodreads friend made me aware of this series, then, I didn't waste much time grabbing this, the first one. Without question, I enjoyed it. And while the gory serial killer aspect probably won't entice my hubby to try it, I'm sure he'd like the main man, homicide Detective Robert Hunter (as did I, especially since he was a child prodigy who earned a degree in psychology at age 19 and a Ph.D. in criminal behavior analysis and biopsychology four years later). On top of that, any guy who loves single-malt Scotch can't be all bad.This story begins with the discovery of a young woman's body; she's been gruesomely tortured, mutilated (all the skin was ripped off her face while she was alive, for instance, which gives you a good idea of the tenor of the book) and has a double cross design cut into the back of her neck. The latter is a huge cause for concern for Hunter; it marks the signature of a serial killer he helped capture two years earlier - a man who was executed for his grisly crimes. Hunter had a few misgivings back then, but now he's afraid the wrong person was convicted and the real psychopath is back plying his gruesome trade.This time around, Hunter - who is dealing with issues of his own including doubts about his former partner's supposedly accidental death - is working with a newbie partner Garcia. The first chapter sets out what Hunter is up against, and from that point on, the action never stops. People are biting the dust right and left and Hunter and his partner are sure something \"connects\" them all; but how long will it take (and how many more murders) before can they find out what that is and correctly identify the killer this time around? To be honest, I had a few issues with the book, such as the occasional grammatical error and terms that are more British than American (the author lives in the U.K. but the story is set in Los Angeles, so there shouldn't be any language crossover). Another niggle is that all the characters are exceptionally well spoken, so every time the word \"ain't\" popped out of their mouths - which was quite often - it elicited a discord reminiscent of fingernails running down a chalkboard. But I also figure some of that goes with the territory for a series debut - and I'm confident the books will get even better as they go along (as of this writing, there are seven in all, I believe). Now, I just have to find time to read them!"}, {"userName": "Janet ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19512233-janet", "userReview": "I don't really know where to start with this one. I had seen Chris Carter's name bandied about and came across a couple of books in a Kindle sale which sounded really intriguing so promptly went off and downloaded book one. A few chapters in and it became clear that this is a debut novel. Many a time I stopped and shook my head in wonder because I couldn't believe what I was reading. A combination of Carter's profile and reading this book highlights that Carter knows profiling, but OMG!! The dialogue! More often than not it felt like I was in a lecture hall and being given a lesson on all things profiling, (hold up there FBI, I'm on my way!!), as page after page was filled with what can only be described as lecture notes! The dialogue between characters felt clunky, many elements of the book was cliched and cringe making, and well didn't sit comfortably. There were some aspects that were good and there was potential for a real good story here but it got lost in what turned out to be a formulaic and fairly poor execution. The murders themselves were gruesome bordering on shocking at times but unfortunately got lost in the step by step guide to 'how to spot a serial killer by fast tracked because I have a super brain, but I like to play it down cop/protagonist.' I guessed the murderer about halfway through the book, don't think I was meant to, it just kind of glaringly jumped out at me. I didn't know the whys so a couple of little surprises were presented at the end. I did race through the book, it is pacy and exciting at times, just was let down by informative dialogue that didn't feel like storytelling.In short, I don't think I'll be rushing to read book two but I can see the ideas are there, just the execution was a little lacking in this one."}, {"userName": "Marie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6587391-marie", "userReview": "This was an amazing book!

I recognize the attempt of giving the opening of the book some spice when it is not really needed. The plots of Carter are not slow simmering stories that work their way to a crescendo instead they are a very descriptive stories with a lot of bloody details that are not for the fainthearted of readers. Carter does know how to write a decent and exciting story that are easy to read and he does show his knowledge and skill of the mind set of the serial killer which makes interesting reading.That these book have not been filmed does not surprise me as the books lack that extra special thing that makes better than the average serial killer story, SEVEN & the Lecter Trilogy do have that and you lack the curiosity and skill from those stories.

I felt like this novel was just a clumsy vehicle for the author to show off how much he knows about criminal psychology and profiling (which was his former profession, I believe). I didn't care about the main character (Robert) and none of his emotional reactions felt real to me. He is one of those too good to be true protagonists, great at everything and faux humble to boot (\"I read a lot\"). Normally I can overlook that sort of trope if the dialogue and supporting characters are fun and entertaining, which was not so in this case. The conversations read like lectures half the time - especially when he was speaking to Garcia, his rookie partner. The author used his newness as another way to throw infodumps out in large pieces.Honestly, I was more interested in D-King's underground kingdom than anything Robert was doing."}, {"userName": "Jenny", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38750886-jenny", "userReview": "Das Buch lag ne gef\u00fchlte Ewigkeit auf meinem SUB,zu unrecht wie ich jetzt feststellen musste.Nach den ersten 40-50 Seiten hatte ich die Bef\u00fcrchtung,dass es mich eventuell nicht richtig packen k\u00f6nnte,aber dann wurde ich doch relativ schnell eines besseren belehrt und wurde in den Bann der Geschichte gezogen und habe mitgefiebert.Obwohl ich sonst ganz gut in sowas bin,bin ich hier nicht von alleine auf den T\u00e4ter gekommen,insofern hatte das Buch also sogar bis zum Schluss noch den \u00dcberraschungsmoment auf seiner Seite.Jedoch fand ich den Geistesblitz von Hunter,als er dann darauf kommt wer hinter allem steckt,doch etwas zu konstruiert.Insgesamt aber ein wirklich gutes Buch :)"}, {"userName": "Tracy Fenton", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18478389-tracy-fenton", "userReview": "A cracking start to a highly recommended series.

Actually I was only going to give it 1 star, but the ending had a great twist I don't think anyone could have expected. It really surprised me, - and I liked that, so 2 it is.Theres nothing new in this book. A lonely cop, with a new partner - as his old partner died, is trying to crack an old case that have annoyed him for years. The killer calls him after each killing, which only ads to poor police man Hunters insomnia...ZZzzzZZZZ.I know it\u2019s the writer\u2019s first book, but I don\u2019t think that matters at all when giving a book a review. Debut book or not, certain things just makes a book bad. For example that you feel like you are smarter then the cops the whole way through the book! I mean, Garcia have never heard about serial killers taken something from their victims, and also seem a bit surprised when he hears about \u201csuicide by cop\u201d. Surely cops would know this stuff\u2026I got especially annoyed in the end (spoiler alert) where Garcia is worried that anyone could be the killer\u2019s next victim. However when his wife sees someone starring into their apartment from the street, (past midnight), he keeps telling her is nothing, probably the neighbours kids or a cat.And when he is then abducted by the killer the next day, it takes him forever to even think the thought it could be the serial killer from his own case (Hellooooow, dumbass!)I don\u2019t like it when writer underestimate their readers and explain and explain and explain some more\u2026 And Chros Carter does that, while trying to show off how much he knows about serialkillers himself...It also annoyed me a bit how they were playing god cop/ bad cop every now and then \u2013 that\u2019s just so clich\u00e9 that it makes me want to vomit!The use of \u201cgonna\u201d and \u201cwanna\u201d almost drive me crazy!I\u2019m not sure I will read the next two books. Garcia has to smarten up first \u2013 and I doubt that will happen\u2026"}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5903843-matt", "userReview": "In Carter\u2019s debut novel, the reader meets veteran LAPD Homicide Detective Robert Hunter and his new partner, Carlos Garcia. After being called to a murder scene, Hunter and Garcia discover the Crucifix Killer, thought to have been caught years before, is back and will stop at nothing to continue a gruesome rampage. By marking victims with a double crucifix, Hunter knows that this is no copycat, as he did not release this to the press when investigating years before. The Crucifix Killer is one case Hunter will not soon forget, having worked on the original file, when a suspect confessed to the crime. How will the new victims\u2019 crime scenes help Hunter and Garcia crack this case wide open before the Killer continues a spree that leaves no one safe? A wonderful, edge-of-your-seat thriller that uses realistic dialogue, characters, and teasing language that leaves the reader wanting more.Carter\u2019s work should be commended, especially as this is his first published novel. He hooks the reader at the beginning and works through some of the old case info, while peppering the story with new and interesting facts. Creating a back story for the main character can be tough, though Carter does so very successfully and makes Hunter appear complex enough to have secrets worth learning about. The reader cannot help but speculate what will happen next, though Carter is smart enough to toss in a few storylines that leave the reader wondering what to expect next. Fabulous work and sure to be an interesting series, as I continue through it.Kudos, Mr. Carter for your wonderful work. I am eager to see what else Robert Hunter has in store for you, for readers, and for the Homicide Division."}, {"userName": "L\u00e9nia", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12130032-l-nia", "userReview": "Tinha TANTAS saudades de um policial destes...

On the nape of her neck has been carved a strange double-cross: the signature of a psychopath known as the Crucifix Killer.But that's impossible. Because two years ago, the Crucifix Killer was caught and executed. Could this therefore be a copycat killer? Or could the unthinkable be true?
