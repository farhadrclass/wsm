She has come with a clear mission and intends only to stay long enough to get the answers she needs, but she finds herself becoming friends with locals Cleo and Sarah. Cleo is busy running her cafe, little realising that there are serious problems in her children's lives. Sarah is about to get married, but is harbouring doubts over her relationship with husband-to-be Jon.The plot weaves their stories together as the three ladies begin their friendship; like a few episodes of a soap opera in book form really. At the start I had a bit of a job keeping up with who was who as there were so many characters and different stories playing out, but this got better as I became more involved with the different groups of people. The plot itself didn't hold any major surprises for me as I kind of guessed a lot of what was happening and who was responsible as the stories played out; I still found it enjoyable though, and really liked Erin Knight's portrayal of the three main characters.*I received a copy of the book from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Janette", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4119720-janette", "userReview": "A very interesting read highlighting the current obsession with social media.
