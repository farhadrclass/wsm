I decided to try again because I'd survived reading about the intergenerational conflict in Prospect Street -- if I could enjoy that book (and get enough sleep) maybe I was ready for this one, too. I'm glad to say I was.Wedding Ring is centered around three generations of women who are reunited when the Nancy, the daughter and mother, gets a call telling her that her mother's home is a health hazard. Both Nancy and her daughter, Tessa, respond and show up at Helen's house, uninvited and unwelcome. As the summer unfolds so do their lives, and so do the quilts that Helen has been making since her childhood.I'm once again in awe of Richards' ability to capture the personalities of so many characters, so many lives, in one story. It's my impression that this is the first in a series of books involving quilts; I'm very much looking forward to the rest!"}, {"userName": "Pat", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2592945-pat", "userReview": "I liked the story about the 3 generations. Actually, there were 4 generations but you have to read it to get the picture. The Grandma, Helen was raised in the country and very poor. They made the most of everything. I was , yes, I think I can say this honestly, speechless when I read that Helen knew of someone who took the thread out of the flour sacks and saved it and crochet doilies with it. My Mom is like the Grandma. She used to save nearly everything. Reading this book made me think sadly, of how wasteful we are, and how much we could learn to take more care of our resources. And also to use our imaginations more.However I also have the bad habit, inherited from Mom that I also keep way too many things, thinking of using them, someday.Nancy, Helen's daughter, had married well but never felt worthy of the things she had or the abilities she possessed. She never felt \"good enough\". Despite her adjustment to her well ordered life, she always appears to feel as if she was still trying but would never be as good as she wanted to be. I think it is interesting that the author makes the point of how many people deep down still, in spite of their accomplishments never feel it is good enough.How sad. How much is enough?The book has many lessons and I did enjoy the story of how the three women bonded over a summer. I loved the stories about all the quilts. I was happy that all the women found something to be happy about in each of their lives. The Granddaughter, Tessa, lost a child and she became so obsessed and bitter it was almost hard to not feel frustrated with her. However, I do not know how I would have responded had I faced the same situation. And that is really a huge part of the story. It made me think that there is definitely a time when some people just are so much in need of someone who can professionally counsel. Before it becomes obsessive. I find I too, want to be \"a fixer\" myself. Each woman faced their own trials, tribulations and ghosts. They each also came to understand why the others were like they were, and why. in the end,they all grew. Yes, all in all, I suppose I did like the book. Didn't love it, but did like it. We all must face our fears , I suppose and there really isn't any time line that fits everything, for everybody."}, {"userName": "Kathryn", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3076351-kathryn", "userReview": "Wedding Ring was a reread for me, and I am so pleased I chose to do so by the audiobook version. I loved it the first time I read it, and totally fell in love with the characters and story line all over again as I listened to it. To be honest I had forgotten many details of the story - I just carried the general feel of the story with me. Now I have a refreshed memory of it!Isabel Keating does a fabulous job in the narration. I loved her Helen voice and the way she just totally brought her to life for me. Whenever I thought of this book I remembered the opening scene when Helen was holed up in her house and her daughter Nancy and grand daughter Tessa were trying to get in. Wonderful scene.The story follows the lives of these three remarkable women. We are taken back in time to Helen's early life and see where she came from and her joys and sorrows. We are also taken back in time to Nancy's earlier times too. As the story develops changes happen for all three women, and they are bonded together in ways they would not have thought of earlier. In the beginning they are not that close. Tessa has had heartbreak in her life and she is estranged from her husband. Nancy seems to be a bit of a socialite and Nancy - well she is a bit crotchety! I loved her anyway. There is Cissy Mowrey as well who lives nearby, she is pregnant and unmarried and Tessa and Helen reach out to her.It is with this series I began my obsession with quilting, Helen is an expert quilter and I just wish she was a real live actual person and I'd love to go see her quilts. I loved the way her daughter Nancy, helped her see the value in what she had done. I must say the Quilt Along With Emilie Richards that goes with this book is also a favourite and I hope to try out a few of the Sunbonnet Sue examples. I have plans!In short - love, love, loved it all. Guess who will be revisiting the whole series via audiobook!"}, {"userName": "Liz Balaam", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8141270-liz-balaam", "userReview": "After chapter 1 I was not sure I wanted to carry on, as it didn't immediately grip me. However, not being a quitter with books, I decided to press on. By the end of Chapter 2 I had fallen into this book with a resounding thump and had to ask myself why on earth I had thought I would not enjoy it. This is about Helen, Nancy and Tessa. Three generations of women, bound by blood, but with little else in common - or so they thought. Nancy and Tessa, mother and daughter, find themselves thrown together when they spend the summer with Helen, Nancy's mother and Tessa's grandmother, in order to help clean up her old farmhouse home. They start off tentatively - just tolerating each other, but as the story unravels, the relationships between them are explored and they slowly become more accepting of each other and realise that they do actually have a lot in common. The side relationships between Nancy and Billy, and Tessa and Mack, are interesting and thought provoking - particularly Tessa, who lost a child and is trying to come to terms with it. Of course, the 'thread' holding this story together, is the art of quilting. Helen is a master at her craft and reading about American Quilting certainly got my interest, and almost made me want to take up quilting myself! Highly recommended, and if you have not read Emilie Richards before I urge you to start doing so."}, {"userName": "Kathryn", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3076351-kathryn", "userReview": "Currently rereading: By listening to the audiobook.I really enjoyed reading this book. It was my second by ER. I loved the way she explored the relationship of the women (Helen, Nancy and Tessa)who ranged three generations. Helen is a wonderful character and I enjoyed meeting up with her in Endless Chain as well. I also loved the way ER explored the relationships of Tessa and Nancy with their husbands. And what the death of a small child had done to Tessa and Mack. I also loved the setting in Shenandoah. In some ways this setting reminded my of Robyn Carr's Virgin River series. They both bring a sense of love and community."}, {"userName": "Kate Vale", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14516714-kate-vale", "userReview": "First in the Shenandoah Album stories, it revolves around three generations of women: Helen, crotchety quilter and hoarder, Nancy, the social climber, and Tessa, griever of the loss of her 5-year-old daughter.When Helen needs help, her daughter (Nancy) and granddaughter (Tessa) move in with her, determined to set things right, which includes moving Helen out of the messy house and cleaning it up in order to sell it. Those goals gradually change when Tessa discovers all manner of secrets in the house, including beautiful quilts made by Helen, some deemed \"rejects,\" others beautiful works of art that Helen doesn't really recognize. Each of these women come to learn about themselves and their relatives, but mostly about their intertwining relationships with one another and their respective spouses: Helen's died on the Arizona after getting her pregnant. Nancy seems to have lost touch, though she still loves her successful husband from a prominent Richmond family. Tessa's grief places her at odds with her attorney husband, who also suffers the loss of their daughter, but also his marriage to Tessa. Will they ultimately divorce, as she seems to want to do? Or does she?An affecting, beautifully written tale of redemption and forgiveness amidst a greater awareness of family togetherness."}, {"userName": "Cindy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19971833-cindy", "userReview": "I picked up Wedding Ring by Emilie Richards because, as a quilter, I can\u2019t resist books with a quilt-related theme. Wedding Ring is the story of 3 generations of women, and how they each struggle to work through the difficulties of life. The youngest, Tessa, lost her daughter to a drunk driver. Her mother, Nancy, struggles to find true meaning in her life and marriage, and Helen, the grandmother, has withdrawn from her life, and become a pack-rat. As the three women spend the summer together, they share the stories of their lives, and grow in their understanding of themselves and each other. As with all of Emilie Richards\u2019s books, this was a lovely story, full of complex characters, difficult emotional problems, and seemingly real relationships. We experience the emotions of Tessa as she struggles to carry on with her life and her marriage after a drunk driver killed her five year old daughter. We also experience the relationship of Nancy and Helen, and learn how WWII redefined the lives of many families, as the men left to fight with few returning home, and the women were left to carry on alone. This is a book that is worth reading!"}, {"userName": "Christy Lewis", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39978745-christy-lewis", "userReview": "A great story that encompasses 3 generations of women.

For me, it is a story to be savored, a bit at a time. Wedding Ring is about 3 generations of women - mothers and daughters - who must spend the summer together cleaning up the family farm house. 83 year old Helen is a master quilter, and alot of this story is centered around her exquisite quilting. Helen, her daughter Nancy and her granddaughter Tessa all have a lot to learn about themselves, each other, what they mean to each other and how much they truly love each other. All 3 of these characters were well developed as were other characters in the story as well. I love the author's insight and detail of family relationships. This is the first title I have read by Emile Richards, and I certainly will be reading more. \"She was afraid to love me,\" Nancy said. \"I never realized it.

And Tessa herself is in turmoil following a family tragedy that has affected them all.Now, with the gift of time, Tessa's eyes are opened, and she begins to see her mother and grandmother for the flawed but courageous women they are.
