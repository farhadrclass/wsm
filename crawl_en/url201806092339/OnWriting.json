Some talented people are able to create it intuitively, but some of us benefit greatly from the words of others who have figured out a piece of the mystery and are willing to share. This is not light reading, but it is a goldmine for anyone trying to crack the mysteries of the fiction-writing craft. \u201cThe plot goes forward at the pace of its own necessity, its own heartbeat. Its way ahead, its line of meaning, is kept clear and unsnarled, stretched tight as a tuned string.\u201dWhat a beautiful sentence in itself, but also packed with wisdom for the writer, and this little book is full of such gems. Some writing books are academic, some are full of arguments and theories, and some are quite entertaining and funny. This writing book is, well, writerly, as if Eudora Welty crafted it with the same care she put into her fiction. What a gift."}, {"userName": "Whitney", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2087955-whitney", "userReview": "Lovely, tiny collection of essays about aspects of writing, from Welty's thoughtful and wise mind, told with the egalitarian voice (she begins the first essay: \"Looking at short stories as readers and writers together should be a companionable thing\") that makes her fiction, her fiction.

There are times where as a reader you may want to take Paul Chowder by the shoulders and give a good hard wake-up-shake, and yet if you've done any writing at all, you know that's not the way it works. These are the kind of holes we have to dig ourselves out of. This is the story of a poet's struggle to write the introduction to an anthology of rhyming poetry, but it is much more than that. It's an exploration of creativity that resonated with me.The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern: Surprisingly enchanting love story! Selection of detail and use of figurative language create a cleanly embellished world that you kind of want to live in. Morgenstern's vision of love captured this sap.The Tenth of December by George SaundersEvery word carefully selected to tickle you, the. hit you hard with the matter. And he doesn't shy away from any matter of moral complexity.The Flame Alphabet by Ben Marcus: If this was a film, I would have nightmares for days. Terribly depressing. Carefully written. Pokes a little too close to truth at times to bear. I collected many sentences for their stand alone greatness.Housekeeping by Marilynne RobinsonThe sentences of direct narration anchor a story so watery and internal that it almost doesn't seem real. Except that it does. Very real in terms of emotion and character. A story that set up my expectations, but surprised me in the end, that explored themes of noncomformity and convention with insight that had me nodding yes and in a style so particular that I had believe it was from the heart. A slow read in the beginning that encouraged this reader to stop and smell each sentence rose, but that built momentum and meaning in the end. Cuckoo's Calling by Robert GalbraithExcellent mise-en-scene! A work of crime fiction in the style of an old detective film or a pulp novel. Though the mystery could have been more tightly concealed, I loved the main character Strike and his assistant and how the novel unfolded visually. I will read #2!Quiet by Susan CainI wish I had come across this book sooner, as a young person or a young mother because there was so much in this book that affirmed my experience as an introvert and the parent of an introvert. What I like most about the book is that at its heart it seems to be mostly interested in illuminating the difficulties in human relationships because of personality differences and a step toward self-acceptance and understanding of others. As an educator I feel emboldened to continue my own efforts toward personality inclusiveness in my classroom because I agree with Cain's assessment: \"The purpose of school should be to prepare kids for the rest of their lives, but too often what kids need to be prepared for is surviving the school day itself.\"On Writing by Eudora WeltyProbably due to the reader, not the writer, there were times when I struggled with this short book on the writing of fiction, times when I just didn't get it and times when the texts used to illustrate the point were unfamiliar to me. Yet, there were these moments of connection that kept me bobbing along the surface of this heady exploration of the art of fiction and the role of the writer. Some quotes that emerged as meaningful to me: \"No two stories ever go the same way, although in different hands one story might possibly go any one of a thousand ways; and though the woods may look the same from outside, it is a new and different labyrinth every time. What tells the author his way? Nothing at all but what he knows inside himself: the same thing that hints to him afterward how far he has missed it, how near he may have come to the heart of it. In a working sense, the novel and its place have become one: work has made them, for the time being, the same thing, like the explorer's tentative map of the known world'\" (45, Place in Fiction)\"Place, to the writer at work, is seen in a frame. Not an empty frame, a brimming one. Point of view is a sort of burning-glass, a product of personal experience and time; it is burnished with feelings and sensibilities, charged from moment to memnet with the sun-points of imagination\" (49, Place in Fiction)\"Making reality is art's responsibility\" (53, Place In Fiction). \"And if life ever became not worth writing fiction about, that, I believe, would be the first sign that it wasn't worth living\" (80, Must the Novelist Crusade?). \"Fictional time may be more congenial to us than clock time, precisely for human reasons. An awareness of time goes with us all our lives. Watch or no watch, we carry the awareness with us. It lies so deep, in the very grain of our characters, that who knows if it isn't as singular to each of us as our thumbprints. In the sense of our transience may lie the irreducible urgency telling us to do, to understand, to love\" (Some Notes on Time in Fiction, 100)."}, {"userName": "Austin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1382279-austin", "userReview": "This little tome is filled with wisdom. It gave me a greater appreciation for the art of fiction writing, which--like all art--is a lie that helps us understand the truth. Writers like Welty have a keen sense of place, time, plot, and human character. Their caricatures and settings describe the paradoxes and complications of our existence from their perspectives, which are often blessed with a strong sense of humor, irony, and other softening senses to a reality that seems harsh or unjust to less broad-minded observers. It's a privilege to learn from her. I don't usually go for stream of consciousness writing, but she convinced me to give Faulkner another chance. Some of my favorite quotes: --\"So this story, instead of being a simple situation, is an impression of a situation, and tells more for being so.\" pg. 6--\"Writers must always write best of what they know, and sometimes they do it by staying where they know it . . . The open mind and the receptive heart--which are at last and with fortune's smile the informed mind and the experienced heart--are to be gained anywhere, any time, without necessarily moving an inch from any present address.\" pp. 55-56--\"Security is mortal's chiefest enemy\" (from Macbeth) pg. 56--\"The challenge to writer's today . . . is not to disown any part of our heritage.\" pg. 56--\"There is absolutely everything in great fiction but a clear answer. Humanity itself seems to matter more to the novelist than what humanity thinks it can prove.\" pg. 78--\"Memory believes before knowing remembers.\" pg. 103 (from Faulkner) --\"To me, no man is himself, he is the sum of his past. There is no such thing really as was, because the past is. It is a part of every man, every woman, and every moment. All of his and her ancestry, background, is all a part of himself and herself at any moment. And so a man, a character in a story at any moment in action, is not just himself as he is then, he is all that made him.\" pg. 104 (from Faulkner)"}, {"userName": "Blake", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2044060-blake", "userReview": "On first being drawn into an expansive world of a new author I generally have for a portal that author's best known, best loved and/or first book. In some cases, and owing to particular circumstances, I might start off on a minor work, willfully transport myself for lack of adequate device, and one-by-one build up my traveling by dimensions; however, by rule of habit a book of literary criticism by an author of fiction is a late point of encampment on a typical excursion. As much as I own to such a convention, I would also make a point to convene on bucking conventions based off of an inner or a social duty.So, with Eudora Welty I took a different path by first beginning her On Writing and part way through it diverging into her little abode of symbolism, A Worn Path. Having diverged, the trip ahead is planned. I have an idea of what to expect, so many landmarks will not come as surprising as they would or might to an unadvised traveler, but as much must come with this prior expectation the happy fortune to have them exceeded.Prior to On Writing, I knew of Eudora Welty as a prize-winning author, whose Southern embodiment and human landscape is visible in the rural work of Alice Munro, but it was a nice discovery that found Welty also preceding Munro in temperament and attention as well as she does in subject and the importance of place.A writer has perhaps picked this up cursorily for practical tips on writing, but an education at that level is not to be located here. That said, there are lessons to be taken carefully and particularly that, I think, are more important - lessons for which Welty is ideal as a teacher. Her writing contains every kind of vibrancy and colour, so that a traveler who takes her up as their guidebook must inevitably and swiftly become seasoned."}, {"userName": "Abby", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6262367-abby", "userReview": "\u201cArt, though, is never the voice of a country; it is an even more precious thing, the voice of the individual, doing its best to speak, not comfort of any sort, indeed, but truth.

Yet in reading great works one feels that the finished piece transcends the personal. All writers great and small must sometimes have felt that they have become part of what they wrote even more than it still remains a part of them.\" (58)\"Fiction finished has to bear the responsibility of its own meaning, it is is own memory. It is now a thing apart from the writer; like a letter mailed, it is nearer by now to its reader.\" (62)\"The novel is something that never was before and will not be again. For the mind of one person, its writer, is in it too. What distinguishes it above all from the raw material, and what distinguishes it from journalism, is that inherent in the novel is the possibility of a share act of the imagination between its writer and its reader.\" (75-76)\"The ordinary novelist, who can never make a perfect thing, can with every novel try again.\" (80)\"The real dramatic force of a story depends on the strength of the emotion that has set it going.

Therefore, I may have overdone it when I decided to read both her \"On Writing\" and a collection of her short stories at the same time. I suppose my main problem with this book is that Welty is a highly, highly intuitive writer, and is not so much worried about the more nitty-gritty parts of writing. This means that I didn't come away from this book with a checklist of ways to improve my writing, or reasons why I like a certain author's writing better than another's.
