Adam and Meryam, an adventurous engaged couple, lead an expedition to explore what is thought by many to be Noah's Ark. Their team includes archaeologists, representatives of Turkey, mountain guides and a priest, among others. Once up the mountain and inside, they discover what seems to be some type of coffin. Is this really Noah's Ark? What's in the coffin? More importantly, will the team get out alive? You will have to read this to find out!Ararat  raced along barely letting me catch my breath. As the team's investigation into the ship and its contents progressed, the story became darker and the tension hummed along. The main characters were all complicated which added a lot to the atmosphere, especially towards the end. Once I hit the second half of this book, it became impossible to put down and I finished it in one shot. By that time, I had developed real feelings for a few of these people and I just  had to see what happened to them, and let me tell you, that ending? I can't remember reading a more satisfying finale than this in a long, long time. Bravo!A tale of isolation, frigid temperatures, snow, and  something unknown; I can't help but be reminded of one of my favorite horror movies of all time, (based on a novel by John Campbell), called The Thing. This novel is slightly more complicated, but the atmosphere and the tension are there in spades, and what horror fan doesn't love that? Ararat is everything it promises in the synopsis and more. I cannot think of anything that could have been done better, because this book is already perfect. My highest recommendation, most especially to fans of The Thing, or The Terror by Dan Simmons.  Ararat is a MUST READ! Available on April 18th here:Ararat: A Novel*Thank you to NetGalley and St. Martin's Press for the e-ARC of this book in exchange for my honest feedback.

Not super awesome or anything. Here are my thoughts on a few items:The writing \u2013 I think this would have worked better as a short story. Even thought it was not a very long book, it felt very repetitive and drawn out. Because of this, I don\u2019t think the suspense and thrills really ended up being all that suspenseful or thrilling.The plot \u2013 I cannot say too much about the plot without giving it away, but I will say that I thought the main crux of the plot was very interesting, unique, and frightening. If only it had been delivered better!The characters \u2013 All of them were so flat. Even by the end of the book I had some issues distinguishing characters and what their part was in the plot because nothing about any of them stood out. There is not really any character development (except they become angrier versions of themselves from time to time). If you like books with dynamic characters, you can skip this one.If you really like horror, stories based on archeological digs (you know, Indiana Jones type stuff), survival in the face of very bad odds, then you may like this story. I do not strongly recommend it, but it did remind me of books that I love from those genres."}, {"userName": "Magdalena aka A Bookaholic Swede", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1379514-magdalena-aka-a-bookaholic-swede", "userReview": "I was really bummed when I was not once, but twice declined for this book on NetGalley. So, when the book was released did I actually buy it, despite the fact that I seldom buy new books. But, just luck at the cover, it's fabulous and the blurb really intrigued me. I couldn't wait to read the book. \nPerhaps I did have too high expectations because the book didn't really rock my boat. Sure, it was interesting to read, but it was never intense or terrifying, not even a bit chilling to read. It was ... OK. I just thought the story would be better. But, looking back can I see one big problem with the book and that's that the characters never came to life for me. They weren't fleshed out enough to make me care for them. I wanted to care for Meryam and Adam and the rest, but even when things started to go out of hand on Ararat, and people started to get killed off did I not really find the story intense because they were just names and let's face it, of course, the less important people would get killed off first before the more important ones were at risk. As usual. Yeah, I'm a grumpy horror fan. But, I like my horror books to be surprising and terrifying, not following a formula. Even then ending felt predictable. The book was not all bad, I liked the beginning best when everything was still unknown and the ship hadn't been found and the things that happened after that. And I was curious to see how it all would end. But, for being a very short book did I feel like it took me ages to get through it. So Ararat, didn't turn out to be as fantastic as I had hoped it would be. I liked the idea more than the result and I wished the characters had been more fleshed out."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17957823-erin", "userReview": "Book hits stores on April 18th!Like puzzles? Feel like you need to tangle with the supernatural? Enjoy dabbling in the odd horror? Well, this book might hold the key to quenching your literary requirements. In regards to whether or not those were the requirements I was looking for, I think I was more strongly swayed by some of the earlier reviews of the book. The Da Vinci Code comparisons sealed the deal. Ararat takes place in the mountains of Turkey, when a group of mountaineers make a staring discovery. A wooden boat frozen inside a mountain. Could this be the the biblical Ark manned by Noah? Well, many people begin to think so and many experts in archaeology, theology, international organizations, and film makers descend to study it further. Amongst the group is engaged couple, Adam and Meryam, who are highly interested in presenting their findings to the world. But things turn bizarre quickly and many begin to question what kind of Pandora's box they just might have opened. Is it possible the old religious texts that hinted that Noah placed demons on his boat are true?Yeah, so there were times that I wavered between rating this a 1 star or a 4. At 200 +pages, Ararat, is a fast paced read and I wanted to follow through to the end. But there was a lot of horrific violence in this story that at times, came across as a really bad slasher film. In addition, the characters were all pretty disgusting human beings. In Da Vinci Code, I think that Dan Brown was able to take the theory at the centre of his plot further than Christopher Golden does. Here the last 1/4 of the text escalates at a very high speed and I just wanted to get past all the horrendous violence that becomes a bit over the top. So, a 3 star for me, but possibly it just wasn't the \"right fit\" for my reading palate.Thanks to NetGalley for an uncorrected digital galley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Richard", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4677640-richard", "userReview": "Ararat is set in that always dependable horror environment: the cold, unyielding snow. It also works as a pretty effective locked-room thriller as well, taking place almost entirely in a recently-opened cave thousands of miles high up on the side of a mountain. In it, a group of scientists and adventurers discover what they believe to be the mummified wreck of Noah's Ark. But it really starts to get freaky once they find a tomb there with a body inside. A body with horns on its head. As I mentioned before, the location sets a great mood and Golden does a good job at maintaining the atmosphere and the isolation of being stuck in a 4,000 year old shipwreck in a never-ending snowstorm. What's pretty potent in the middle section of the book is the feeling of paranoia that begins to infect the group.The book never really took off for me though. Golden seemed to be skirting around a lot of interesting ideas and great moments but never really nailing it the way I'd hoped. Some of the conflicts and plot twists came off as strained and artificial. It wasn't terrible but when it features such great material for a premise, and it's effective setting, I expected to be more engaged and affected than I was. Golden does some solid writing here but it feels as if a stronger writer would have taken this story and killed it! Ararat may make for a good summer read thriller for some though, along the lines of Michael Crichton, Dan Simmons, or Dan Brown."}, {"userName": "Mogsy (MMOGC)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4379514-mogsy-mmogc", "userReview": "3.5 of 5 stars at The BiblioSanctum https://bibliosanctum.com/2017/05/12/...Adam and Meryam are a newly engaged couple from very different backgrounds, but they have always bonded over their love of adventure. In recent years, they have even achieved moderate fame for their series of videos taken from their travels around the world. Now they are eyeing their next great challenge, an expedition to climb Turkey\u2019s Mount Ararat after an avalanche has reportedly revealed a massive cave up high in the side of the mountain. Wasting no time, Adam and Meryam call upon an old friend to be their mountaineering guide, and together they begin a harrowing race up Ararat in order to be the first ones to discover its secrets.However, what they end up finding in the cavern goes even beyond their wildest dreams. Within its depths, the couple discover the remains of a large ancient ship, which immediately raises the question: could this be Noah\u2019s Ark, the great vessel that weathered the Biblical flood in the Book of Genesis? To answer this question, a full team is quickly assembled to excavate and study the find, with Meryam at its head as project manager. Included among the scientists and other experts is also a documentary crew, which is how, when a mysterious coffin is unearthed among the ruins, everything that happens next is captured on film.Throwing caution to the wind, the coffin is pried open, revealing an ugly, desiccated corpse. It is immediately apparent to everyone present that this could not be Noah\u2014for the body is twisted and misshapen, and the top of the creature\u2019s skull is adorned with a pair of horns. The remains of the demon\u2014for it is impossible not to think of it as such\u2014puts everyone on edge, regardless of their religious beliefs. Soon, the tensions start taking their toll, with project members acting erratically and others going missing. Worse, there\u2019s no escape, for a blizzard has swept in, leaving them all trapped on Mount Ararat with an evil force.This is my first Christopher Golden novel, and I was not disappointed. Of course, it didn\u2019t hurt that I\u2019m a big fan of \u201csnowbound horror\u201d, which I truly believe is starting to become a bonafide subgenre of its own. The most effective stories of this type can make you shiver even while reading in the sweltering heat of summer or indoors beside a warm and cozy fire, if the author can convey the right type of atmosphere. There\u2019s just something I find so creepy and oppressive about the isolation of wintry, sub-zero temperature settings, and happily, Ararat was no exception. Golden was able to capture the forbidding environment of the mountains, making it clear that, whatever may happen to our hapless characters, they are on their own.I also enjoyed the novel\u2019s premise. I think most people are familiar with the story of Noah\u2019s Ark, but probably far fewer of us would expect it to be the topic of a horror novel. It made for a strange but suspenseful read, with just enough ambiguity to keep one guessing. Contrary to what one might think, the story is also very light on the religious themes, focusing instead on the human drama. Even without the threat of a demonic presence, trap a large group of strangers together in an inaccessible cave on the side of a mountain and inevitably you\u2019ll see the fur start to fly. I was motivated to turn the pages simply because I wanted to see how everything would resolve, and in a way, the tensions and mistrust between the project members reminded me a lot of John Carpenter\u2019s The Thing\u2014all it takes is a bit of doubt and suspicion thrown into the mix, and even the strongest relationships can begin to fall apart.Yet I do have one major complaint about this book, and that is the story\u2019s pacing. From browsing reviews of Golden\u2019s other works, it seems like a rather common issue among readers, and I couldn\u2019t help but notice a lot of a similar pacing problems in Ararat. Namely, the author blew through things so fast that I barely had a chance to connect to any of the characters, and therefore many of their ultimate fates left me feeling unaffected. Character depth was also pretty much non-existent, with heavy reliance on telling rather than showing, and sometimes the difference between a good book and a great one is the effort and time it takes to develop these little details.Still, Ararat was a solidly fun read, despite not meeting its full potential. It\u2019s certainly no Dan Simmon\u2019s The Terror, but these kinds of books are also satisfying in their own way, and not least because they are often guaranteed entertainment. If you\u2019re simply in the mood to pass the time with a creepy thriller-horror novel complete with gore, violence, and a staggering body count, this book will get the job done well."}, {"userName": "Bark", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2905339-bark", "userReview": "I went into this book with a wee bit of stink eye because although most of my friends loved Snowblind, I really didn\u2019t love that one. I enjoyed the setup but when the novel decided to time jump 12 years into the future it tested my memory and my memory failed. I am so glad to say that Ararat didn\u2019t hurt my brain, is genuinely chilling and the pages fly.It\u2019s about a couple who take the trip of a lifetime and leave for Turkey in order to be the first to document a discovery that will quite possibly shake up the entire world. They are on a search for Noah\u2019s Ark. But what they find on the dig is so much more than proof that Noah and his Ark may or may not exist. They find a coffin with something inside that is most definitely not a man and terrible things start to happen soon after it\u2019s unearthed. The least of them being a treacherous storm that traps them and their team with this monstrous thing!This is one of my worst nightmares. My son loves hiking and it terrifies me. I always have visions of him falling off the mountain and dying or I fear he\u2019ll stumble across some human monster lurking in the woods. Now I have some brand new nightmare fuel to add to my head thanks to this book. The feeling, on this high summit, is claustrophobic and pretty damn terrifying in and of itself but then a blizzard hits. Imagine being so far up on a mountain that you\u2019d have to tromp back down if anything truly terrible happened to you in order to get proper medical care? Break a leg and you are pretty much screwed. This is not my idea of a fun time. The situation reminded me a little of those fools in The Ruins by Scott Smith  who climbed a mountain in a foreign country to discover ancient ruins who only managed to get ruined themselves. Only this time there are no fools. Thank whoever. These people are intelligent and driven and the story is very, very scary. There\u2019s action, lots of characters that didn\u2019t get me all mixed up but in all honesty none who I cared all that much about. Some of them, most of them actually, were very selfish, so minus a star for that because I like to feel something when someone is slaughtered and I didn\u2019t get an emotional gut punch here. But did I mention there\u2019s a monster that these people are trapped with on top of a mountain during a blizzard?! Ahhhh! I loved that part.I listened to this book on audio, narrated by Robert Fass who does a good job with the male characters but left a little to be desired with the females and their accents.

This reminded me of my favorite Michael Crichton books, Sphere and Andromeda Strain, with the slight supernatural leanings of early Preston and Child. It's a bunch of different people from a bunch of different fields and backgrounds that come together to study something that hasn't been seen for a very long time. I thought the story was cool as hell and towards the end when I said to myself \"oh shit, it's about to get corny\"... it didn't, very cool. This is the first book I have read by Christopher Golden, and while initially picking this up because of the setting and the comparisons to books like the Terror, I was impressed with the originality and sense of dread the story offered up. The Terror, Abominable, In the Kingdom of Ice, The North Water, I love books set in cold temperatures and I thought this was going to be another race to the top of the mountain kinda thing and when they reached the \"top\" at like 13% on my Kindle I had no idea where it would go.

It feels like vintage Michael Crichton to me, with a plot something like: Dan Brown meets \"The Thing\".A huge earthquake and avalanche at Mt. Ararat (in Turkey) exposes a cave in the snow. That mountain has long been rumored to be the final resting place of Noah's Ark, so a number of teams set out to explore the newly uncovered cave hoping to find archaeological gold. The first team to the cave will win the scoop. This \"race to the cave\" is only the very beginning of the novel.The team to reach the cave first is an engaged British couple, Adam and Meryam, a quintessential digital age couple who make adventure videos together. They find that the cave is, indeed, the ark, complete with various levels of ancient timber floors and walls, \"stalls\" ,and the remains of a human family and animals. Also in the ark is a sarcophagus that contains the skeleton of something with horns that might or might not be human.A group of scholars, Turkish bureaucrats, archaeologists, local guides, an American man sent from DARPA to see if the find can be weaponzed (uh-huh), a UN observer, priest, etc, all end up at the ark to investigate. They are high up on Mt Ararat, isolated from the world by a blizzard, when sh*t hits the fan.At times, this feels like a monster movie, ala \"The Thing\", with the isolated group of people being hunted and picked off one-by-one. There's a supernatural element here, so this is definitely more horror than thriller. There were some nice touches having to do with dreams and the past history of several of the characters that gave the horror some depth and the book a bit of a literary edge. The story becomes quite tense and scary. It's quite a nail-biter. If you don't like violence, you probably need to skip this one.I really enjoyed the pseudo-history/religious elements in the story, though they stay at an Indiana Jones sort of level. The characters were all unique and had some layers. Meryam, for example, who heads the project, is a woman who is not always likable but she is smart and ambitious and generally makes good choices. The sexism she faces from the local guide was quite realistic. Another stand out was Walker, the secret DARPA agent, who is a tough fighter but also compassionate and a thinker. The writing style was tight and unadorned. The plot moves forward at a fast clip and there's no fluff or filler.I guess this has already been tapped for a movie. I'm not surprised as it totally reads like one.Loved it! If you miss old-school horror, give this one a try."}, {"userName": "Frank Errington", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3553381-frank-errington", "userReview": "Review CopyAfter an earthquake in the mountains of Turkey, a new cave is uncovered on Mt. Ararat.\"They spotted a cavern up on the southeast face that wasn't there before. Big one.

They are not alone on their quest and when the Turkish government finally gives their permission to start the climb, they are off on their journey.Their nearest competitor was Armando Olivieri, the leader of a group of Arkologists\u2014the people who believed the biblical version of the story of Noah's ark and had dedicated their lives to finding its resting place.Other key players in Golden's intricately constructed story include Feyiz and Hakan, guides to the region of Mt. Ararat. Ben Walker supposedly working for the National Science Foundation, but actually for DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency). There's also Kim Soeng, a UN observer, and Father Cornelius Hughes, an expert on ancient civilizations and languages.What is found in the ark causes those assembled at the site, Muslims, Jews, Christians, and Atheists alike, to question their beliefs and leaves them shaken enough to become confrontational with one another.\"The current of hostility running under the surface of almost every interaction in the cave could have been ascribed to any number of origins. Most of these people had been crammed together inside the ark for weeks, unable to get truly warm or comfortable enough for a deep restorative sleep. The Kurdish guides and workers shot one another suspicious glares, some kind of fracture withing their own group. The project foreman, Hakan, seemed to hate pretty much everyone on general principle. And that whole stew of animosity existed even before they brought religion into the mix.\"Ararat is truly the stuff great motion pictures are made of. Action, adventure, a love story, and a killer that seemingly can't be stopped. And, a story that keeps the reader guessing all the way to the terrifying conclusion.Available in hardcover, e-book, and audio CD formats, from St. Martin's press.From the author's bio - Christopher Golden is the New York Times bestselling author of such novels as Snowblind, Dead Ringers, Tin Men, and so many others.

Okay so the confusion (on my part) the story starts off with an intriguing idea and the whole atmosphere and environment are very effectively portrayed but as the story progresses I start to wonder what is going on. The problem I will admit is that it felt like a number of story ideas melded together and although there was a coherent storyline all throughout I didnt feel it was not consistent - as if it had been written in sections. Now I know it never fair or a good idea to compare one book with another but I did wonder at times what was the end goal.Now this is where it gets tricky with the whole no spoilers but I did wonder what the final motivations of certain characters where.

But when ambition leads them to the top of Mount Ararat, ambition might turn to be out a lot more. Ararat is the horror novel by Christopher Gold which is one of the best horror books for 2017.Maryam and Adam are a newly engaged young and very ambitious couple. Together they have coauthored a lot of books about their adventures and travels to thrilling and dangerous places. To them, that thrill is not only about making a living, it\u2019s the way they feel alive. Having written three very successful books, Meryam comes to Adam with the new opportunity in hand. An adventure on Mount Ararat to explore an ancient cave over there. After a recent avalanche, the cave had emerged. Can this cave be related to Noah\u2019s Arc? Can this be their opportunity to a groundbreaking discovery and thus to worldwide fame and fortune?A team of researchers, archeologists, film makers and even UN and US representatives is assembled. Together they work at this extremely dangerous altitude to unravel the cave\u2019s secret. The joy of the discovery is thrilling, but something is not right. Something is lurking in the shadows and waiting for them.Ararat has been one of the best horror books I read this year. The adventure is very thrilling. Also the setting is more than wonderful. I love books about mountains and snow. If climbing such mountain as Ararat was not challenging enough, then there\u2019s the mysterious evil on the top. It\u2019s not only that. Christopher Gold has his way of setting the events and the characters. The writing style is eloquent and encompassing. I loved the way he weaved myth into his story, I stayed all night unable to put the book down. My eyes were closing, yet I was dying to know what comes next.One of the things I loved about the book was the ending. It follows some classical masterpiece of literature, but I still loved it. I think it also gives way to a second installment. I don\u2019t know whether the author intended to have other installments. All I am saying is that his ending allows for that. It can be a fantastic second installment.Some few things I noticed about the book. I believe the author wasn\u2019t successful in portraying how women are treated in the Middle East. He emphasized how the Turkish guide was not used to reporting to women and just tried to ignore Meryam and scorn her. Well, that\u2019s not the case. Women in the Middle East are well educated and respected and can have whatever post they are entitled to just like men.**Special thanks to NetGalley & St. Martin's Press for supplying my copy of this book in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

I\u2019ve never read Christopher Golden before, never read anything marketed as fiction involving Noah\u2019s Ark either. So, really, I had no clue what I was getting myself into when I picked up the book.Ararat is a fast-paced horror thriller with a good dose of atmosphere. When they\u2019re inside the ark, you can immediately feel the evil settling into the air. What do you get when Jews, Muslims, and Catholics all find themselves working together at a religiously significant site? At first, just a bunch of people there to do their jobs, which was refreshing! I liked how Golden set things up for this. With the UN oversight, the restrictions about not claiming the area for any one religion, etc. It kept it from taking a left turn into becoming a festering ball of religious one-upmanship and animosity. So, when tensions start to build after the evil has firmly got its hooks in, it\u2019s easy to read it without bias.I wish that the book had focused a bit more on Meryam (and Adam) as I felt there were some unexplored possibilities there. Towards the end, I felt like I didn\u2019t know Meryam nearly as well as I wanted to. That made it a bit harder to root for her, and to feel the appropriate emotions at certain times. Instead, the main protagonist of Ararat is exactly the type of guilt-ridden male figure you expect to find in these books. I do give the author points for saddling him with some real issues, though! He \u2013 the whole cast, really \u2013 was still interesting enough that I had trouble putting the book down to go to sleep!But, people who read a lot of horror novels are going to be able to lay out the rough details of the last half of Ararat. The author does throw one or two curve balls at you, but the rest of it is fairly predictable. Ararat is an enjoyable read, but just not as exciting for the more jaded readers. The way the last few pages are written, Golden is setting the stage for a possible sequel at some point. I\u2019m ambivalent about that. I think a large-scale version of the possibilities he\u2019s left dangling would be interesting, but I\u2019d have no interest in reading something that centered on just a few people.Overall, while not a breath-taking thrill ride, Ararat is a great introduction to Christopher Golden. If you have read him before, I have a feeling you\u2019ll be satisfied with this latest work. There\u2019s plenty of action, tons of atmosphere, and people dying all over the place. What\u2019s not to love?Disclaimer: I received a free copy of this book via netgalley for review consideration."}, {"userName": "Ctgt", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3787451-ctgt", "userReview": "For me, the hard part for authors when writing a horror/suspense story is maintaining a feeling of tension, unease or fear throughout the tale. Golden does a better than average job with this book and he accomplishes this through multiple POVs as well as different character nationalities and religious idealogies. As he jumps from chatacter to character you get a different sense of fear and dread from each one. After an earthquake(or possibly something else?) a section of Ararat is sheared away exposing the remains of what appears to be a boat. Of course the initial excitement is the question, \"Is this the boat? However the point of emphasis changes from what have we found to what is the strange object found inside the boat? As the story progresses and the atmosphere within the dig and among the participants deteriorates, people start to disappear and any means of escape is blocked by a snow storm that is battering the mountain. Overall a pretty good story that does a nice job of delivering a feeling of unease and dread.8/10"}, {"userName": "Jeremy Hepler", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3671357-jeremy-hepler", "userReview": "Great story and characters.

Previous to this I read Bloodstained Oz which was co-written by him and James A. Moore and it was wicked. I had been seeing a lot of hype for Ararat everywhere and was lucky enough to get approved for an ARC through NetGalley. Ararat was not what I was expecting. It was so much better. An inhospitable mountain. The discovery of what very well may be Noah's Ark tucked into the side of the mountain. The remains of what appears to be an actual demon inside. Everyone knows the biblical telling of the story of the Ark, but an adventure-seeking couple may just have stumbled upon the truth and the truth does not always set you free. When an odd mix of scientists, religious representatives, overseers from the Turkish government, and the team that discovered the ark begin uncovering the secrets of the lost Ark, this discovery is more amazing than any of them ever imagined and quite a bit more deadly.I loved every minute of this book and it pained me any time I had to put it down. Next on my list to read from Golden will be Dead Ringers, Ancient Enemy, and whatever else I can find by him. I only can't believe that I had not read him sooner. This will definitely be on my top list for 2017 and I hope to have a signed copy of this on my bookshelf soon. If you aren't reading Ararat, you should be.I received an e-ARC of this from St. Martin's Press and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Aristotle", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61131794-aristotle", "userReview": "A Jew, a Muslim, an Atheist, and a Priestwalk into a cave...which is actually the entrance to Noah's Ark...so they think...and then people start dying.I found this book to be a struggle.

Thankfully, this book was as good a place as any to experience Golden's long-form prose, and post-Ararat, I expect to be reading plenty more this guy's work in the years ahead.Convinced that they have discovered Noah's Ark after an earthquake reveals a hidden chamber inside Mt. Ararat, a team of researchers dig deeper, hoping to find answers to a series of questions thousands of years old. Led by newly-engaged non-fiction adventure novelists, Meryam and Adam, the team of researchers, scholars, and government overseers find quite a bit more than they bargained for. What they find is something ancient, something evil. As a snowstorm pummels Ararat, and members of the crew begin disappearing, the expedition finds themselves trapped by hostile forces all around.I've noted before that I'm a bit of a sucker for horror set against arctic climes. There's just something about the visceral nature of freezing winds, violent snowstorms, and blood-spill that really draws me in, from John Carpenter's The Thing to Dan Simmons's The Terror, and real-life horrors like the Shackleton expedition and the polar voyage of the USS Jeanette. And now, Ararat.Golden nails the atmosphere exceptionally well, and the growing sense of unease and paranoia infecting the researchers is very well drawn. That this works so well is a testament to Golden's ability to draw characters - Meryam and Adam are a flawed, with their problems beginning even prior to their arrival at Ararat. Their difficulties finding a wedding venue for their upcoming nuptials is certainly relatable, and but the deeper issues underscoring this difficulty sets the stage dramatically for the events that follow. Golden does a fine job laying the groundwork early, seeding it with enough doubt so that when conflict erupts it's built right into the core of these characters and their relationships. Ararat is a slow-burn horror novel, one that is deliberately and methodically paced. Golden lets the conflict simmer, masterfully building up the tension as he peppers in a series of crises that lead to a wonderfully aggressive climax fueled by distrust and fear. This is the perfect snow-day read.[Note: I received an advanced copy of this title from the publisher via NetGalley.]"}, {"userName": "Matthew", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5014178-matthew", "userReview": "Looking over my friend's reviews, I'm in the minority, being the only one who didn't absolutely love this one and I can't really put my finger on why.

After reading SNOWBLIND, I dove right into ARARAT. Once again, I devoured the book. Great characters, and constant-moving-forward plot, and the tension and suspense builds and builds.I love Golden's crisp writing. He adds just enough details to paint a picture for readers with his words, but does not overdo it. (As I find too much kills the story tempo, and turns a book into a boring snooze-fest). No fear of that with Golden,After an earthquake a face of the Ararat Mountain crashes away during an avalanche. A cave is exposed. Teams from all over the world race to be first to explore the cave. A husband and wife team that writes books, and shoots documentaries about their adventurous waste no time getting to Turkey and securing the best guides for their journey up the mountain.Adding to the mix government and U.N. representatives, professors, archaeologists, paleontologists, a priest (while muslims are most popular in the area), and Ben Walker from the \"National Science Foundation,\" you've got yourself an explosive mix of Type A personalities. With a storm moving in the time for exploring the discovery is limited.But the entire world is watching. Because it is not a cave that has been unearthed. It is a ship --and potentially The Noah's Ark. The Biblical ark. The find could change the world. Forever.The problem isn't the boat --or the natural questions about how it would up at the top of a mountain in the first place. The issue comes from a coffin found inside the ark, and the remains discovered inside the sealed sarcophagus. Is exposing what is within, a something not human-like with horns to the world be the best choice? Could something so old carry unknown diseases? Ancient writings, wards, and spells . . . Noah?

They climb the mountain with a group including guides, a priest, turkish officials, a UN rep, scientists and historians. As they investigate the timbers of the ancient ship, they discover a coffin that encloses horrific misshapen remains. The terror that ensues will be of Biblical proportions. The tension and horror of this story builds at a steady pace. There is enough action, suspense and surprises to keep a reader's attention from start to finish. I was engrossed in the story right from the beginning. It's easy to understand why Adam and Meryam are so excited to jump right on this discovery. I don't know of any explorer or scientist who wouldn't want to explore the remains of Noah's Ark. And, through this story, it was so intense to experience their slow realization of just what horror they had uncovered. Not to mention the fact that they are all trapped at the top of Mount Ararat during an intense storm. The ending of the story caught me by surprise. A perfect ending for a horror-filled tale.
