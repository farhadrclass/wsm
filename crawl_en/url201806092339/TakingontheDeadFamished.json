My dark brown hair has, at some point, become a ratted, matted mess, creating thick dreadlocks falling down my back to my waist.later \"flowers\" give a \"floral scent\" to the air, etc...although sometimes it is adorable:They are sitting chickens waiting for slaughter. And who knows what else?I AM HAVING AN ANIMAL METAPHOR PARTY!! THEY ARE ALL COMING AT ONCE!!! NO, I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE WEIRD, THEY WILL JUST MERGE...the names in this book kill me: kale, glinda, kansas*??? and rudy as your dreamy male lead??? there is only one rudy, and it is not a sexxy dude:(although - holy cow - she got gorgeous)but what is happening here?? do only people with stupid names get to survive zombie apocalypses?? (i am not even going to mention kansas' full name, because that is just... wow) but it really doesn't matter what kansas is actually named, because she is more often that not called \"kan\" or \"darlin'\" or \"sunshine,\" or \"suga.\"which drove me crazy.this is when i first realized i was in trouble:Black leather boots under frayed jeans hold a zombie head down as he jerks an arrow out of the skull. His arms flex when he wags gooey bits from his arrows.I can't see his face, but he is tall, much taller than me with broad shoulders and wavy brown hair tied back with a green bandana. His hair shines golden brown as it blows in the wind, caressing the compound bow strapped to his back.A large arrow holster hangs by his side. The hunting bow goes from the back of his knees to a few inches above his head. The biggest bow I've seen, making me think it is custom made. The wind blows in the other direction, and his hair whips across his face. It barely brushes the tops of his shoulders.This guy is locked, stocked, and loaded with a big gun tucked into the front of his jeans.oh, indeed. still think we are in a horror novel? with all the jerking and flexing and blowing and caressing and big bows?? oh, yeah, and the big gun in the front of his pants. i nearly missed that subtle image.but this - this is where i almost lost my mind:\"Well, I see yew wakin' up. We have a tawk, yew and me.\" Again the accent confuses me, most likely from a northern location.\"Pretty boy came into duh city, told me yew was sick, so I lent dem drugs to yew. Pain killas too. Got's stitches now, yew gotta be careful wit dat. I know da pretty boy from months past. Met him lookin' all like juice head gorilla. He's off seeing to me a fava. But yew gots a few more days, needs dem drugs for two weeks.\"writing in vernacular should never be attempted by someone unless they can really make it work.what kind of accent is that supposed to be, anyway?? (incidentally, the character's name is \"guido,\" so i can hazard a guess, but what a mess.) and why, later, repeatedly, should \"fuk\" be spelled like that? it has the same sound as \"fuck.\" is it just to denote the relative stupidity of the character? like, \"man, this person would probably spell that word this way because they are totally dumb and low-class...\"in a related note:the \"asian-american\" character is introduced at the same time as \"his buddy,\" the \"african-american\" character. the \"asian-american\" is a practitioner of the kung-fu, while the \"african-american\" character is... ready?? DANCING TO A BEAT IN HIS HEAD, all gold teeth and baggy clothes. he then says \"wussup?\"it is good to see that the antiquated stereotype store is still in business. this is a tiny thing, but it is more evidence that we are not in a zombie novel: you get to go through someone's closet to find new clean clothes and you choose a sundress?? no. a thousand times no. you don't need to look good, you need to be able to run and climb and maybe you want some more coverage so that zombie-teeth have to work harder to break your skin. also, as an aside - waist-length dreadlocks are another zombie no-no. yeah, it makes you look all tough and mad max-y or whatever, but a zombie is just gonna use them to reel you in like delicious seafood. good lord, do i have to teach you people everything?I decided against taking anything, believing we have enough of this stuff anyway.i never understand this attitude. you know the world has essentially ended, and they aren't making any more of this stuff, right?? this is like that susan beth pfeffer series, where they are all \"let's just take what we need right now because i am sure no one else will want these supplies and they will be here forever...\" NO! INCORRECT!! usually hoarding is bad, but THIS IS THE END OF THE WORLD, PEOPLE! this is zombie novel rule 101. oh but right - we are in a romance novel. we are all about measuring out the release... the tease.. the slow disrobe. let's not take it all at once.gain one star for underground zombie sex party. you would think this would lose it a star, but i actually liked this club - where men fight in the ring (yes, this also points to it being a romance novel, as our sweaty male lead fights for dominance under the watchful gaze of our reluctant female),and zombies are chained to pillars and nudely \"dancing\" in cages for lively decorations.i thought this part was very evocative and not something i have read before. i liked the atmosphere she wrote here, although i personally would never go to one of these places. i am liking it as a reader, not as a \"gee, i wish these places existed...\"i also liked the tip on \"why we mustn't throw molotov cocktails at zombies:I quickly figure out why this is not a good idea. It only makes the zombies come at you while on fire.i file that one away for future use.but, lose one star for letting someone who was bitten by a zombie into your secure bunker. so, this review is my response to all the 4 and 5-star reviews, which make me sad for not loving it as much as everyone else, but \"fine\" does not make me give it a 4. unfortunately. not even to an indie.*which, if you have seen zombieland, should make you wince. particularly when the film is explicitly referenced later."}, {"userName": "Carol (StarAngel's Reviews) Allen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6294320-carol-starangel-s-reviews-allen", "userReview": "Wow...this book took me FOREVER to finish it!I'm sorry but there was just too much in-depth descriptions that took away from the action of the story.This has definitely not been one of my favorite zombie books and I don't know if I will continue with the series now that all the back stories have been revealed.Butttt....I kind of want to know what happened with Mac and what will happen with Rudy and Julie!!UGH...decisions - decisions!!"}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1460100-lori", "userReview": "The plot is solid. It's amazing. It twists and turns. It kept my pants on fire for the two days it took me to read it. :( Why so long? Well because I had to pick it apart as I was reading it. Also I had to work at my part time job. Boo. Mama needs the cash though. Ok enough rubbing it in that I got to read it already and you didn't. NA NA. LOL. This book was unique. Trust me Annie it was! I still haven't figured out what the hell is going on. I like it though. I like it a lot. When I read the preview a while ago. I was like...righteous! This is balls to the walls amazing. I was so off course with my assumptions of what the rest of the book would be. I thought that she would meet a group of people and continue to flee the famished. Maybe fall in love. Kill a shit ton of zombies. Find some semblence of a sane life and then have it ripped out from under her. Making the next two books necessary. SOME of these things happen. Not in the way I thought though. Not at all. There is something seriously fishy going on here. I can't quite put my finger on it though. I feel like I get close to figuring something out and Annie throws something new at me. The romance. Oh gawd the romance. It's hot. This book is not meant for the the typical YA set. This is very much an adult book. The men (I'm a woman and straight, of course I am going to focus on the men) are freaking hot! OMG. Drool. There is more than one too. They reek of alpha male with a soft side too. Oh be still my beating heart. The romance is on par to something in AtWD. Sure Rhiannon never focus's on it as intensely as Annie does but these are two different stories. I just wanted to give you another example of love in the time of a ZA. It develops only because they are in a semi safe place at the time. People do not stop being sexual, or being attracted to others just because zombies around. I think most people would use it as stress relief. Also, Kan has been alone for 4 years. Let's not begrudge the girl some fun. Some just reek though. Haha. Fella's, Kan is pretty smoking too. She's got brains, brawn and a sense of humor to boot. There are sexual situations in this book, and there is drug use. Oh and I forgot. GORE GALORE. Is it the grossest zombie book I have read....hmm? Well, there are parts that literally turned my stomach. Which was awesome. It wasn't just shock value either. These are genuine actions that these characters partake in. They are true to character. The B-List characters are a freaking hoot. I mean it. There are some unsavory characters that Kan meets. Each is more disgusting than the next. Kan also meets some awesome new friends. Don't let this make you think she's compliant though. She isn't. She keeps her wits about her at all times. Well most of the time. Nothing is too easy for her. She has skills that definately help her survive but it's not all just given to her. Annie makes her work for them. Awesome. I hate it when the heroine is able to pick up a gun and suddenly be Jean Claude Van Dam. There are some gut wrenching parts too. Like my heart is in my throat parts. Annie treated these parts right. Kan has a vulnerability that is genuine. Ugh have I said any spoilers. I sure hope not. Anyway...about that rating. Well it's random. I HATE giving a number rating to a book. To me if it entertains me and is fun it's worth a million stars."}, {"userName": "Sinn", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4693342-sinn", "userReview": "Sometime on Tuesday or Wednesday of last week, I finally finished this book. Since then, I have been trying to figure out how best to approach and write this review. The first time I saw this novel was on an ad for a book tour. Being a zombie apocalypse book, I was very quick to jump at the opportunity to read it. Unfortunately, despite my love, I really did not enjoy the book. The reason is because this book completely failed. And it failed spectacularly!At first, I had high hopes for this book. Reading through the prologue, I was fairly impressed. It was very powerful, gave a wonderful opening for the story, and did a good job of showing how the zombie apocalypse can seemingly come out of nowhere to disrupt a perfect life. At this point, I started to notice a few extraneous commas, improper placement of punctuation, etc. However, since it could be easily explained as a typo, I didn\u2019t think too much of it. That is not to say that it didn\u2019t put me on alert. As the book progressed, I started to have issues with the voice. It can be very hard to write in first person present active; however, the author manages to pull it off. That being said, something about Kan\u2019s voice was very troubling. Unfortunately, I still cannot quite put my finger on it. And, while the narration was bothering me, I started to notice that the grammar issues continued to get worse. It evolved from a few mishaps into the author\u2019s haphazard attempt at throwing in punctuation because it seemed appropriate. She started doing clause fragments. (Keep in mind, this is not a technical term; it is one I coined to describe her errors.) Further into the book, I started to wonder whether she understood what adjectives, series, and multiple adjectives to describe a noun really were. It is hard to describe fully what she did; however, if I had not known what she was doing, this book would have been hard to understand. Unfortunately, comma misusage can seriously change the meaning of a sentence.Aside from the author\u2019s haphazard and willy-nilly approach to grammar, she had grievous issues with consistency. On one page, she would oscillate between \u201ct-shirt\u201d and \u201cT-shirt.\u201d Unless the author was trying to write within a certain style, I do not care how she chose to spell T-shirt. My issue stems from lack of consistency. Decide how you want to spell the word and keep to it. Even if the word was misspelled, if she consistently used the same spelling, I would not be as annoyed. While the author\u2019s grammatical errors were egregious, this book also suffered from an obvious lack of content editing. I felt there were a lot of things that Kan did in the later part of the book that were completely out of character with the original girl the audience met. In most books, this can be explained by character development; however, there was no true character development. Further, at one point, Rudy makes it clear that he worked as a contractor before the zombie outbreak. If the reader continues reading, Kan makes a comment that helping at the greenhouse made sense due to his carpentry background. Where did Rudy ever say he had a carpentry background? Working construction does not guarantee you have that as a background. In addition, I cannot fully grasp Kan\u2019s need to carry around a computer. Granted, her computer used to connect via satellite; however, it might not be able to connect at other locations outside of her home base. Further, if some person manages to get the Internet up and running, why would she suddenly have access to wireless? This makes no sense to me. Even my husband, who has worked as a systems administrator for over a decade, could not understand the rationale behind this. If the author had mentioned \u201carrow holster\u201d one more time, I would have broken my husband\u2019s Kindle. Anything that is used to hold arrows is considered a quiver. The fact that her quiver is larger than others and made out of a gift container for a bottle of wine does not automatically make it something other than a quiver. This really got on my nerves. Another thing was her explanation of bows. Yes, long bows are fairly old; however, a recurve bow predates them by more than a millennium. In addition, a recurve bow was desired for its power and the energy it put into the arrow. Long bows were more desired for range and the fact that they worked well en mass.Along with the bows, the author really needed to do her homework when it came to guns. Yes, a grip is one of the most important things in determining the correct gun. However, her comment about making sure the person could use the slide very fast isn\u2019t accurate. You need to be able to move the slide smoothly and have a good grip. Further, the weight of the gun also needs to be considered when finding the right weapon. And Kan\u2019s adventure with the sawed off shotgun was fully inside the realm of fiction. Yes, because of the shortened barrel length, a sawed off shotgun will have a nasty recoil\u2014and will more than likely bruise your shoulder. However, it will not knock you off your feet and send you several feet in the air. Well, I guess it will if you\u2019re on the receiving end of the spray. When talking to Reece about her book collection, Kan pooh-poohs The Jolly Roger\u2019s Cookbook by stating that it wouldn't be able to teach them how to make things like pipe bombs because it is too old. This could have changed in the last decade; however, when I was still a teenager, the book was not static; people kept adding to it. And, at the time, it had recipes for making pipe bombs. Further, Kan tells Reece that they can get better books by looting bookstores. So, by the author\u2019s logic, I can walk into a Barnes & Noble and purchase a book on advanced bomb making (and, of course, making a simple pipe bomb is extremely advanced bomb making).It stuck out to me that Reece\u2014in a time period where infection is easy, antibiotics are not easy to come by, and an open wound could possibly mean zombie infection\u2014doesn\u2019t take the time to cover his new tattoo. Yes, the ointment is important; however, a fresh tattoo is still an open wound and susceptible to infection. This really upset me because I have multiple tattoos. It seems to me that a tattoo artist would be extremely vigilant about that, especially during a zombie apocalypse.Honestly, Kan is zombie bait. The only reason she has survived is because she was alone and then surrounded by men that would take care of her. She can only handle a pistol crossbow and her few blades. She talks about not being overly accurate with a full-sized crossbow, she is not able to handle a regular bow (a compound bow), and cannot find the safety on a gun. I honestly wondered why she was put in charge of a group. Further, aside from the few she dealt with on her way to the survivor camp, she had no experience with the famished. Someone like Reece would have made far more sense. I cannot stand a heroine who has to rely on male characters to keep her alive. If the characters acted as partners and relied on each other, I could easily accept that. However, I am sick and tired of seeing these supposedly strong female leads that cannot take care of themselves. Half of the things Kan does to get herself in trouble are simply because she lacks common sense or forethought. Her use of the Molotov in Wal-Mart is a perfect example of this. It would not have taken her two seconds to figure out it was an extremely stupid idea. I do not understand why Kan was so hell bent on bringing Julie with her. It made no sense. Further, how would a woman who is eight months pregnant be able to fit on the back of a Ducati? If she was able to (which I sincerely doubt), how would Kan keep her from getting off the bike? It would have made more sense to leave Julie, reunite with the gang, tell them the information she learned from the doctor, and then plan another strategy to gain entrance into the base. In addition, since the doctor knew about the impending attack (because Kan was too stupid not to tell Julie next to the playground), I don\u2019t understand why extra security measures were not taken. Further, I am not sure how a few pipe bombs were able to breach the walls. I have to wonder whether the author really knows what pipe bombs are for. Using them against zombies is a pretty good idea. They are shrapnel bombs meant to inflict as much damage to a person as possible. The author\u2019s constant obsession with the \u201chappy trail\u201d was enough to make me gag. I understand being in isolation for four years will cause a girl\u2019s libido to spike when they\u2019re around a sexy man; however, it was over the top.There is a lot more I could address in this review, but it has gotten to be quite long. Needless to say, when I finished this book, I was very disappointed. To me, it is the perfect example of why I dislike self published pieces. Granted, there are some wonderful things out there! Unfortunately, a lot of people are in a rush to get their novels published because they think it is good and they completely forego editing. I\u2019m sorry, but there is a reason for the process. I will give the author a little credit, she has the bare bones of something that could potentially be a good story. However, she needs to go through several revisions and rewrites. Honestly, by just having some friends and/or family read it to see if it made sense, a lot of her issues would not have appeared in the final book. Further, if she decided to completely turn her nose up at the editing process, I wish she would have spent a little time researching things and rereading her story before it was made available to the public. As it stands, this book is a long way from a polished work of fiction. That being stated, I will end up reading the other books in the series. However, I hope for her benefit\u2014as well as that of her audience\u2014she will seriously look into getting her next books edited."}, {"userName": "Eva Rose", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10336770-eva-rose", "userReview": "Actual Rating: 0.5 starsThis book lied to me. It did.It made me promise that it couldn't keep. This book, promise me an epic story of a zombie apocalypse only to turn into a \"Days of Our Lives\" soap opera episode with zombies and some gore splatter around just for shits and giggles. It starts out well enough, gory and dark just like any book with zombies should be like but then around 60% of the way through suddenly the plot vanishes and we start to focus on the drama unfolding between Kansas and her two love interest and the bane of my existence pops up to kick me in the head. Yes, a fucked up love triangle happens!More like love square really, because there is another girl added into the mix. I mean, there are zombie's out there and an infection suddenly happened and quite possibly the zombies are getting really smart and shit. BUT forget that, let's focus on the drama of Kansas and the pissy fight happening among two friends fighting for the right to tumble her. Seriously, it was tiring and I got really angry at the men because they both held back seriously important information from Kansas. And don't even get me started on the protagonist main love interest getting trapped into a relationship by her rival because said woman is pregnant, yes, you read that right the pregnancy trap. Really, the zombies where there for shock value and gore because the plot involving them is really thin and undeveloped. I was really closed to the end when I quit trying to make sense of it all, I just couldn't take anymore of that nonsensical crap. It was all quite nasty."}, {"userName": "Wanderlust", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9797066-wanderlust", "userReview": "\u201cA good spirit you are.

Suddenly, zombies are everywhere, and you are in for the fight of your life. That\u2019s what happened to Kansas. She survived that night, but paid a heavy price.Fast forward to four years later. Kansas City Sunshine Moore, also known as Kansas or Kan for short, has been surviving, hiding out in her family\u2019s underground bunk all alone. A betrayal by a group of people she offered shelter to forces her to leave her home and search for a new one. She quickly discovers there is much she doesn\u2019t know about the zombies. There are the fresh ones, the Famished, and they are very fast and strong. What else doesn\u2019t she know? She has been secluded for four years and now it looks like that wasn\u2019t the smartest thing to do.The first time Kansas meets Rudy, they don\u2019t actually meet. With the long reach of his compound bow, he helps clear zombies from her path, but Kan is still wary of strangers and jumps in her car and races away. It\u2019s a good thing Rudy decides to follow her, because the next time they meet he saves her life.Kan comes to in the back of Rudy\u2019s van. Well actually, it is an armored truck, the kind used to transport money, and it\u2019s perfect for keeping out the pesky zombies. It can also mow them down easily. After a brief scuffle, Rudy convinces her he means no harm. Through conversation, Kan learns about the Famished, the dangerously fast zombies, and how different they are from the others. She learns a lot about what\u2019s been happening while she was isolated in her bunker the first four years. Staying with Rudy, at least for now, is her best bet.My thoughts and RamblinsI\u2019m going to warn you, I feel this story is for the older reading audience. There are no graphic sexual scenes but there is some mature content.I love my zombies and I sure did get plenty of them in Taking on the Dead. I also got one heck of a great story about survival and humanity, and the lack of it. Not everyone that survives is nice, just like before the apocalypse. The characters are diverse and all too human.Of course, there is some romance in the story. It is subtle, creeping up on you, just like it does to Kansas. It is not the focal point, but it definitely makes the story better. Wouldn\u2019t you want someone to have and to hold when your world is overrun with zombies? I know I wouldn\u2019t mind having someone to care about, otherwise, what\u2019s the point of surviving?Kansas is strong-willed and independent, but not necessarily a loner. Enter Rudy and her life gets complicated. Who could resist a man like him. Strong and gentle, with a large dose of sexiness and endearing humbleness. They are a good fit.Here are some of my favorite scenes:I almost elbow Rudy to wake him until I see how he looks when sleeping\u2026Despite all the fighting, his nose is straight. Small scars from past fights etch his skin. A small, wide one dresses his lower lip. One much longer goes from his lower jaw to underneath the chin, his stubble efficiently covering it up. A chipped tooth adorns his bottom row of teeth. The scar on his right eyebrow no longer allows hair to grow, splitting the eyebrow in half. He might get another scar on his left eyebrow, the cut is scabbed over now, and it\u2019s wider then the scar on his left side. Very small imperfections, not even noticeable unless you look closely. It doesn\u2019t take away from his handsome face. It enhances his masculinity, as if he needs it. The small flaws have history and give him character. Flaws I want to know about, and could grow quite fond of if I\u2019m not careful.Jesus. This chivalrous barbarian is beautiful. What am I getting myself into?And of course some humor\u201cI\u2019m thinking of naming your truck. I must be out of it.\u201d I prop my head on the pillow against the window.There\u2019s slight amusement across his features. \u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Something domineering and associated with a big ass.\u201d I motion with my hands.He surprises me by saying, \u201cAgatha. I had a teacher in the sixth grade, and that was her first name. She liked her power over us weaklings and she had a gigantic ass.\u201d He starts laughing and shaking his head as if to clear the thought.\u201cYeah, that fits. Agatha.\u201d I say, trying it out.\u201cShe was scary. I was glad when sixth grade was over.\u201d We both laugh at this. I can\u2019t picture him afraid of anything. It feels good to be laughing about something completely stupid. I can see he needed to laugh too.The humor is well placed throughout the story, lightening the mood and giving you a break from the stress of survival, just as it would in real life. You know the scenes, where the cop makes a joke in poor taste about a victim? That is a coping mechanism, and everyone needs one. The humor makes this story believable.In one part Kansas poses an interesting question about zombies. One I am now curious about as well.Do the souls get stuck to watch and feel their bodies decompose, all the while having an uncontrolled, insatiable craving? I guess that\u2019s why I like killing them, just in case. No one deserves that fate.There are some colorful characters you\u2019ll be meeting. There are the good, the bad, and the ugly. They all play their part, keeping you entertained and engaged.This is my stopping point. I don\u2019t like to tell much about the story past the one-third point. I like to draw you in and get you interested, much the way Annie Walls did to me.I loved every second I was in it, and yes, it felt like I was a part of it. Fantastic job Annie!Just one more thing and then you can go get Taking on the Dead.About the ending!I was talking to Mandy over on Goodreads. She is right about the ending! That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying."}, {"userName": "Jareed", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17117710-jareed", "userReview": "Also posted on my blog: i'mbookedindefinitelyI have substantially pondered the rating I would give to this book with finality. First because this is an independently published book, a fact that should always be afforded respect if not praise for it is no mystery both to writers and even to non-writers like me how hard it is to establish names in the market, more so to move beyond great names in the myriad of genres like Tolkien, Lewis or Le Guin in Fantasy, or of Asimov, Clarke or Heinlein in Science-Fiction (or of Max Brooks in the Horror-Zombie Genre?). Second is that this book has claimed (this word is most appropriate as will be discussed later) to be under the proliferating Horror-Zombie genre. However, it is a greater sin to rate this with something it does not deserve. If a book should break those veils Tolkien and the likes have unconsciously erected albeit in a successful and (portentously) ageless manner, it should be by its merits alone, and by merits alone that this two star rating is founded upon. The Zombie FactorI am a fan of the mindless, flesh eating, human craving zombies. Somehow, in this fictional setting, a thinking, evolving, zombie is untenable and its essence against the basic tenets of the zombie horror genre. Why? The appeal of the zombie genre has been anchored upon the story of survival of humanity, but this story of survival undeniably comes hand in hand with the zombies. This survival has two faces, the possibility of extinction on the one hand, and on the other, triumph over this fictional anathema. Put a thinking zombie in here and the balance tilts to either what is called human extinction removing the conspicuous appeal of human triumph and power or could either be a book, meant more for humor or for the YA shelves of romance. Enter Taking on the Dead! Where there is no need for a zombie literary pundit to tell that zombies are either subplots or plot devices. It is a subplot because the book is not about survival but of personal feelings, specifically the female sexual feeling of the main character. It is a plot devices because zombies momentarily appear to further personal (sexual) relations of the female protagonist with the numerous male characters. The middle of the book is solely dedicated to romance of the female protagonist. Character DevelopmentI don't know how the author has visualized the main character, it turned ultimately as an in inconsistent persona. The author wanted to paint a protagonist who knows how to survive in the post-apocalyptic world by saying that she had resource materials, can jack a car and survived alone for four years since the outbreak. For all that, she turned out to be stupid, real stupidity or forced stupidity, i don't know, all that matter is she is stupid. (e.g. Who takes a bath in a lake fully naked unarmed?)The men are all objects of the pent up libido of our main character, that is all I can say.The supporting cast is the literary embodiment of racial stereotypes. The asian-american as practitioner of martial arts, the african-american as the street gangster/rocker type. The WritingThe writing is, like most YAs, (drumroll) in the prevalent stream of consciousness occasionally interjected with conversations. So it is an easy read.There are a number of awkward passages within the book. Like this:\"Ice seemed to spread through me.\"Better Fit for the YA Romance than the Zombie GenreI fault myself for not taking caution after reading the prologue:\"Sometime later, we got off the Ferris Wheel, both heated, clinging to each other, and ready for another tryst when we went off the beaten path to use the foul port-a- potties. When I think about it now, I know the outbreak began early in the day. We passed several wrecks, heard many helicopters and sirens, and probably saw a few zombies, but were too wrapped up in ourselves to notice. I blame it on being in love, but I swear to myself now if I saw a person walking down the street covered in blood or eating someone, I would have paid attention. Maybe.\"The paragraph was portentous. It had the picture of a romantic, sexual, stupid oblivious makings of the book. I mean come on, who ever you are, however in love you are, you can't be oblivious to several wrecks, helicopters and sirens. That's just being plain stupid."}, {"userName": "Steph", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2142019-steph", "userReview": "First, as a big fan of zombie apocalypse novels, I should alert prospective readers ~ the second half of the book veers away from the gory zombie killin' and survival bits and moves toward romance. To make matters worse, not only is there a love triangle, but it soon becomes a, what? A square? This would have probably turned me off the book had I known about it before starting. If that is not your cuppa, you'll probably want to pick a different book. Second, there are rape triggers throughout the last quarter of the book. Another reason some may choose to avoid this one. Third, if inconsistent and incorrect grammar makes you want to burn a book or bash your Kindle's pretty little head in, you may want to keep browsing. Sadly, while not overly abundant throughout, they do exist, which shows a lack of good editing prior to publishing. Similarly, there are multiple occasions where a bit of research on subjects, such as guns, would have helped as well. Lastly, vernacular writing is typically a major fail for me, with the exception of Stacia Kane's Downside series. In this case, it was just bad, y'all. I'm from the south, but WOW - a bit over the top. I'm not sure if the author was going for a Louisiana southern/Cajun twang or what, but it did not work for me. That said, it's fiction, so the author is free to create her own version of a zombie apocalypse and the survivors in it. I want to give the book a high rating, like most other GRers, because I sought out time to read it and I was able to connect with most, if not all, of the characters. I am a gore-girl, so I dig it when ZA books get down and dirty. But, there are things I did not like as well. Aside from the bits I mentioned above, the second half felt a bit over-packed for me. A novella might have been a better option for the bits that felt slightly forced in this one. And, as much as I like the main character, her actions were not consistent throughout. Normally, this could be credited to character growth, but it felt like the reverse instead. For instance, Kansas (nicknamed Kan) was extremely self-sufficient when we first met her. She'd lived on her own (and lived well) for four years. However, once she started interacting with others she seemed to lose the very attributes that kept her alive. I could blame this on the sudden shock of becoming part of a community, but should I? Shouldn't her new found knowledge of the \"new world\" only make her more alert? I thought so too.The world Annie created, both inside of Kan's bunker and out, is intriguing. She's managed to show some of the best and worst of humanity. My hope is that, in the additional installments, she is able to bring us back to the questions ZA fans will have and further away from the romance aspect. It is very realistic, however, to think people would be looking for close connections during the apocalypse. \"There's no room for feelings in a world full of zombies.\"\"You don't believe that. If anything, a world full of zombies gives more room for feeling.\" But, please, find a happy medium between the two. I'll be continuing on until the end because I must know ... who, what, where, why, when & how?!"}, {"userName": "Lori {Romancing the Dark Side}", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3500106-lori-romancing-the-dark-side", "userReview": "A zombie masterpiece! After a zombie outbreak changed her life forever, Kansas City Sunshine Moore (what a cool name, right?) has spent four years in solitude and avoiding the living dead in her family home. Her survival depends on keeping a low profile but when she encounters a group being ambushed by zombies, her compassionate nature takes over and she takes them into her safe haven, only to have them turn on her and forced to leave her sanctuary. Soon after leaving her home, Kansas is forced to explore new territory and meets up with Rudy, a ruggedly handsome man who helps her during a zombie attack and takes her under his wing, introducing her to a world she's long forgotten and giving her a new reason to keep on fighting.I have to say the writing and creativity in this book blew me away! When we meet Kansas she's a young woman in love, without a care in the world, out enjoying herself at a fair with her boyfriend until a zombie plague attacks the population and loses all those she loves. The story then forwards four years later with our heroine all grown up and kicking some zombie a**! Kansas is a stellar heroine, she's got guts, brains (no pun intended!) and plenty of heart. She's faced with a horrific situation and is forced to grow up fast and become a fighter to survive, her will to live is admirable. I'm a fan of a feisty heroine but what makes Kan (that's what she likes to be called) extra special to me is that she's not paranormal, just a regular Midwestern girl turned machete wielding, crossbow shooting powerhouse in a world full of the Famished.Aside from an outstanding heroine, there are some fantastic supporting characters that you'll love as much as Kan. Rudy, the \"chivalrous barbarian\" with a heart of gold (yes, I'm TEAM RUDY!), Reece the snarky tattoo artist, Mac, the sexy soldier and the ever sassy Glinda all steal the show at some point with their charismatic personalities and charm (that's all I can say without giving too much away). A subtle romance and great humor throughout the story helps lighten the dark reality of their world, making it believable.Taking on the Dead is emotional, gritty and hair-raising! The heroine's voice instantly pulls you into her world and has you biting your nails at the heart-stopping suspense. Ms. Walls weaves horror, fantasy, romance and humor effortlessly into a vivid post-apocalyptic world you can't get enough of...even when you're a little grossed out...LOL With a superb heroine that's not afraid to get a little dirty, stand up male leads and some supernatural magic, Taking on the Dead is dark urban fantasy at its finest! My praises to Ms. Walls for a spectacular zombie debut that was truly EPIC! (as my Zombie Queen friend would say).{ebook courtesy of author via BB Book Tours for review.}Original Romancing the Darkside Review:http://romancingthedarkside.blogspot...."}, {"userName": "Mandy (I Read Indie) Anderson", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3261049-mandy-i-read-indie-anderson", "userReview": "*Keep in mind this is an adult read...not YA.Four years ago the world changed and zombies were eating everyone in sight. Four years ago was the end of Kansas' old life and the beginning of her new life. Her new life that consists of living in a bunker built under her house all alone. And alone was working out pretty good for her until 4 survivors pass through seeking shelter for the night. Unfortunately that is not all they wanted.Now Kansas must up and leave her underground sanctuary to find a new place to live and survive. But the things she discovers about the zombies and the world outside throws her for a loop and leaves her shocked at what she finds.When I say I love me a good zombie book, I love me a good zombie book. But Taking on the Dead was not a good zombie book....it was a FABULOUS zombie book. I loved every ounce and ate it up. (snickers at my pun) It had guts, it had nail-biting suspense about what would happen next, it had me thinking 'did I lock the back door? does it matter\u2026cause a zombie could bust it down, right?' AND...it had a little romance. Not a lot\u2026just the right amount. If I were running for my life in a post-apocalyptic world, I know I would still like a hand to hold. Something that gave me hope that one day it will all be better. (Ok corny moment over. ) Seriously though, the romance was just right and I loved every bit. I actually want to re-read the book right now\u2026but alas, too many books I must review.Taking on the Dead had a whole lot of twists, turns, and gore to keep you entertained throughout the whole book. I don\u2019t think there was ever a dull moment that I thought it was dragging or boring. The ending\u2026oh yes that perfect ending\u2026we get a lot of answers and even some we were not expecting. And I loved the characters that Annie gives us. Each bringing something to the story and each hiding something too. So yeah, Taking on the Dead was flippin fabulous. It is perfect for those like me, twiddling our thumbs waiting for The Walking Dead to come back on (even though I have Dish and have to wait for it to be on Netflix). I am even going to go so far as to say I loved it more than Amanda Hocking's The Hollow's series; which I absolutely loved. And to know that there are 2 more books in the series is even better.

I absolutely loved it! Annie Walls creates an incredible intense story that makes you feel as though you are experiencing every moment with them!! I had received Taking On The Dead as an E-Arc but just completely fell in love with the cover so I knew I had to have it for my bookshelf! I mean a woman, with dreads, and wielding an machete?? Um HECK YEAH!!!!!!!!!! So I waited until the paperback came in to begin this awesome journey. Had I known this book was so awesome I would have read it immediately from the E-Book!!!! I am a huge fan of Zombie books. Some people see \u201cZombie\u201d and immediately think ugh that can\u2019t be good.. But let me tell you that they are SO wrong! Yes Zombie books have the undead in them but that is not all they are about. These books are books of survival and triumph. They delve into the lives of these people that have survived and are living each day as if it were there last. When you read a zombie book you are reading the characters life story. I truly love them because you get to see how people really would act if an apocalypse ever happened. The main character in this book, Kansas, is a complete kick-ass heroine. She is the sole survivor of her family after the apocalypse happens and the first chapters are the book explain how she has come to this point and how she lives day to day. I love every aspect about her but I have to admit one of my favorites is the fact that she has \u201cdreads\u201d\u2026I mean this girl is KICK ASS!!!! She reads books about survival and trains herself for combat. She builds her own bunker and her own weapons. She is everything that I would hope to be should this ever happen. After four years alone she is surprised one day by another group of survivors. Her gut tells her not to trust them but she does and she beings to friend them. Well of course, in this world that is a big No-No! Live for yourself and only yourself! They turn on her and try to take over her bunker. She gets away and then her real story begins. In comes Rudy\u2026the manly, handsome, amazing, incredible, gorgeous\u2026..(Yeah I am a little obsessed with him) hero that comes to Kan\u2019s rescue when she is faced with an small army of the famished. Kan is injured and Rudy realizes that she needs antibiotics so he takes them to a place where he knows they have medicine. Well what Kan doesn't realize is that Rudy has to trade fighting in order to get her the medicine she needs. The \u201ctown\u201d is a very strange place with strange people. I don\u2019t want to give away too much because that takes away from the effect of the story so just believe me when I say STRANNNNNGEEE. Kan meets several new people in this town including Reece, Glinda, and Mac\u2026Oh Mac\u2026yep another stud! And of course Kan falls for him as well. So now enter the love triangle. Mac is incredible and I love his character almost as much as Rudy. Annie Wall\u2019s knows how to write some awesome males into her stories!! I could go on forever about this book and write every detail but I won\u2019t. You need to read it for yourself! It is truly awesome! Kansa\u2019s courage, strength, and will to survive is incredible. I felt like I was living every moment with the characters. I cannot wait to read the sequel and find out where this Kansas, Mac, and Rudy end up!!! Thank you Annie Walls for writing such an intense story! I love that I have now found me another favorite Zombie story to add to my list!!!!!"}, {"userName": "Ali ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5847230-ali", "userReview": "You know when you find a book that you just can't put down - a book that causes you to ignore all other things in life; kids, laundry, eating, etc. and you don't do anything but read? Taking on The Dead was one of those books for me. And even weeks after reading it, I catch myself daydreaming about what might happen next. I'm obsessing...truly.Annie Walls throws the reader head first into the downfall of Kansas' great life. The zombie infestation takes away her mother, her smart but paranoid father and the love of her life. Leaving her to survive on her own in a bleak and terrifying world. She uses the skills her father taught her and the knowledge he left behind to build a small sanctuary for herself, where she lives in relative isolation for four years. When a small group of people stumble upon her little haven, Kansas takes pity on them and in return her outlook on life and the world she thinks she knows, crumbles. With her safe house no longer safe she is thrust into a new world of horrors. Not only will she battle zombies but also, rapists, religious zealots, cannibals and people that would use her for things she really does not want to be used for.Kansas is one total bad ass, zombie-slaying chick. It has become so engrained in her that she gets excited by the mere thought of killing the infected. Yet she's lost much in the process of becoming this lean, mean killing machine.While she doesn't shy away from the monsters she encounters, she has an extremely hard time with anything remotely warm and fuzzy.Rudy enters her life by rescuing her from a zombie attack. Like Kansas, Rudy too is socially inept. Yet, the pair finds something kindred in each other and form a strange sort of solidarity. Rudy is, to put it bluntly, f*cking hot! Or as Kansas calls him 'sex on feet'. The sexual tension between the two is an ooey-gooey, sticky, sweet mess. But many things stand in the way of either of them being able to just give in to the attraction. As Kansas grapples with learning to survive in her new situation she finds she is able to trust and care again. She finds friends in a wonderful cast of unique characters. Some you love, some you hate, some you may love to hate, but all are creatively well developed.Kansas is plunged into a raw, gritty world and takes it all head on. She's a 'warrior princess', a battle maven, a little sex starved hottie and underneath it all, just a girl trying to survive.So much takes place in Taking on The Dead, there is hardly time to come up for air. Which I love in a book. Walls never gives you the want to set the book down, you are constantly in need of finding out what sort of horror or bedlam happens next. It is a non-stop ride from start to finish. Taking on The Dead is not just a smash and gash zombie book, it's a journey of learning how to truly live in a world of so much death.I could fangirl over this book for days but instead I think I will assume the position of Annie Walls' new stalker as I wait for details on Controlling The Dead, book two in The Famished Trilogy (head to the blog ginger-read.blogspot for an exclusive excerpt)."}, {"userName": "Larey Batz", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6699784-larey-batz", "userReview": "Ballsy, imaginative and twisted. Loved it.I was absolutely blown away by the imagination of Annie Walls. From the characters, to the description, to the setting, she created a world that I will never forget. The main character Kan is an average woman dropped into the middle of a 'Zombacalypse'. As she endures her ordeal and uses her wits to survive, she soaks up knowledge and information like a sponge and uses it to her advantage. The action jumps off from the first page and never lets up. There is gore. Lots of it. And if you're a true fan of the genre, you will appreciate the great lengths the author went to in order to make the scenes vivid and disturbing. Yet, the content wasn't gratuitous for the sake of it. As with all good Zombie fiction, it is an intellectual examination of society; a true look behind the curtain at what humanity is capable of when forced to revert to basic fight or flight instincts. Trust me. The details in this novel are stunning. Just when you think you know what is going to happen next, the author does something that completely catches you off guard.Suspenseful, thrilling, innovative and even funny at times, Taking on the Dead' is a book you will not be able to put down. I love that the author obviously did her homework and while she added her own unique twists, she paid respect to the basic classic foundations of the genre. This is is a smartly crafted work, worthy of sharing a shelf with any modern day interpretation of Zombie mythology. Annie Walls is definitely an author to watch.

The chick is walking down a rural road carrying a huge knife and I immediately had to read the synopsis. Its book one of the Famished Trilogy and I got goosebumps! Throw in the living dead, a quest for answers and a mysterious guy and I was totally sold. I am delighted to inform you that Taking on the Dead delivered an action packed post-apocalyptic tale that has left me anxious for book two. Walls paints a beautiful picture of both the horrors and pleasures in a zombie infested world. Her characters came to life, and I found myself invested in their stories.Kansas City Sunshine Moore (yep that is the protagonist name and I love it..she goes by Kan) has been on her own for over four years, living in a shelter below her old homestead. She is a survivalist, thanks to skills her father taught her, and old books from his library. When she encounters a set of humans being attacked her life changes. Determined to find answers she begins a journey towards one of the military compounds. On the way she is attacked by a horde of zombies and saved by a guitar playing, muscle ripped smexy man named Rudy. *swoons* They share stories and begin traveling together. The tale that unfolds was horrifying, suspenseful, and filled with twists. It kept me turning the pages late into the night.I love the characters Walls introduces us to; each is unique and at times mysterious but so fleshed out that you immediately find yourself connected to them. Kan is tough as nails, fearless, brave, snarky and totally kick-ass in the zombie killing department. She moves like a stealth ninja in her torn jeans, boots and dreadlocks. There is also a vulnerable side to her. She has been alone for years, and the first humans she has contact with betray her. Despite this she is eager for companionship and thirsty for knowledge. She is independent, sensitive and wants to make a difference. I adored her! Rudy *swoons*He is hot, funny, shy, eye candy to the ladies and feared and respected by the men. He has secrets, and you just want to pry his soul open and expose them. He is sexy and has heart of gold. He does the right thing, the noble thing, even when every instinct in him is screaming crush and destroy. The secondary characters are developed, original and fascinating. While I did not adore them all, I was certainly invested in all of them. There is an underlying romance, that is not fully developed. There is also a secondary romance where the gentlemen really knows he does not stand a chance, but cannot help caring anyway. While it reeks of a triangle, take heart it really isn\u2019t the battle was won long ago..but living gets in the way and who really knows what will go down in the end..GRR! The good news is that whatever happens romantically will develop slowly and naturally. Well as natural as it can in a zombie infested post-apocalyptic world. One thing I liked was that the romance was really a side story to Kan\u2019s quest for answers and the mission they decide to undertake. This is a dark, gritty new world and the world building was superb. While, we did not completely get a sense of the why the living dead took over, we do know who is responsible. There is so much going on in this novel, as we travel with Kan and learn new pieces of information about what\u2019s happened over the past four years. The tiny cities, scavengers, and the strange government compounds that seem to be controlling zombies all created suspense. Eep! The zombies are teeth-gnashing, flesh-dropping and hungry!!! I loved all the dark, gory details Walls provided. As Kan, Rudy and their friends join together to uncover secrets I found myself completely immersed in the tale. The lines of reality blurred and this world and its characters became real to me. I laughed, I cried, I yelled, and caught that high that only a good tale can bring. Just when I thought they were safe, something else would happen! The non-stop action had my heart racing. I cannot wait for the next installment in this trilogy.For Zombie and post-apocalyptic fans, Taking on the Dead is a must read. Not sure if you love the dead? Then consider reading this for the characters, the suspense and the mystery. This is a perfect fall read, and the perfect cleansing from all those zombie impostor books you read this summer!! Controlling the Dead is the next book in this trilogy and Living with the Dead is the final book. At this time there is no information on their release dates.Kimba the Caffeinated Book Reviewer"}, {"userName": "Heather Felder", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7186847-heather-felder", "userReview": "My full review here.Kansas was perfectly happy with life, until that one day that changed her world.

I'm just saying!But Kansas is so emotionally disconnected that it's far easier to fall into Rudy's best friend Mac's bed than allow herself to fall into, well . . . Rudy! And possibly something bigger and much scarier!This bothered me, and I had absolutely no love for Mac!Did I mention Rudy fights? Like boxing ring, mamma-said-knock-you-out type fighting?Combine that with his down home Southern sweetness, his ability to take down several Zombies at once with a compound bow and the fact that he's possibly the most considerate man walking the face of the zombocolyptic planet and I'm a drooling mess of a woman!There's a whole host of clever characters in Taking On The Dead, each one more intriguing than the last. Though I loved Kansas and all her warrior-goddess-bad-self, I couldn't help but feel the disconnect within her character. This may have been intentional on Walls' part, she has spent the last four years believing she's the only breather left on the planet, but it was enough for me to not fall head over heels for this gutsy little firecracker of a heroine. I'm hoping with the subsequent novels Kansas will continue to evolve and regain much of her humanity.There are a few small things that I disliked about Taking On The Dead, for one the wildly abstract names almost killed me!There was a part where Kansas encounters some scary religious zealots that, for me, just didn't sit right with the rest of the novel and, without giving too much away, towards the end there was a really unpleasant incident that took place involving Kansas and a solider at a secured army base, the timing of which just didn't make sense, but these were a few minor points in what was a very good book!Overall, Annie creates some intense and original zombies, the gore was wonderful but there was entirely too little of it, for me it's a case of GORE IS GOOD!The pacing was brilliant! I never felt bored or like I wanted a scene to move a long a little quicker and each new endeavor (and there are a lot of them) was scary and exciting! Walls' prose was clean and often incredibly poetic. She paints a devastating, yet oddly optimistic portrait of the Zombie Apocalypse!And I'm dying (pun intended) to find out what happens next! I'm giving this one Four and a half OH, BRADS!"}, {"userName": "Eric Hinrichsen Jr.", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13877263-eric-hinrichsen-jr", "userReview": "Edit A few days have passed since completing the book and I feel like my original review isn't well thought out. I also think it rambles quite a bit. Let me try to explain.I like some parts of the setting of the book. The various places that Kansas visits are disturbing, which, in a zombie novel, is what you want. It gains the only star for that.Meanwhile, I really dislike the characters. The first few characters other than (poorly named, in my opinion) Kansas City Sunshine Moore to appear flip on her for very little reason. \"This place is fortified from the zombies. We don't want you here,\" they say. WHY! The woman shared her food, knowledge and shelter with you. She saved you from a (later revealed to be planned) zombie attack. So why are you flipping on her?The character motivations make very little sense most of the time, especially near the end. A big \"twist\" is revealed (and which is easy enough to guess when Rudy brings up the friend he has to rescue), and one character (Mac) tells Kansas what is going on in regards to that. It's later revealed that Mac ran away because he was afraid telling Kansas had caused her to run away.Let's go over a few things:A) Why would Kansas run away based on that knowledge? It's well solidified she's \"dating\" Mac at this point. Why would something about Rudy's past change this? Especially something that should have little bearing on it?B) Why would you yourself run away based on this? I could imagine going out to find Kansas (who, in reality, has been kidnapped), but not running away. Poor choice of phrasing, possibly?The ending feels too quickly wrapped up and certain parts of the book go door-to-door to shock you (that is, they try so very hard to be shocking). There's a brief rape scene that feels straight out of a soap opera. The ending, all the characters go certain ways, and the one new character (Rudy's fiance) decides that Rudy loves her more, and she's going to trick him into raising a child she had with another man she married. Somehow. Kansas could simply tell Rudy her plan quickly, but decides not to.Overall, the character motivations are what drag this book down, along with some of the dialogue being very poorly written.Also, why is there so much weed everywhere??_______________________________________________________________________The last few words in this book say, \"Support indie authors and write a review!\" Unfortunately for Annie Walls, I planned to maybe a third of the way through the book.This book has a lot of interesting ideas that feel like they weren't fleshed out very well. The various places in the book are interesting. It's more the characters that make this book what I would consider \"bad\".The characters feel soap-opera-like at times. Their motivations and allegiances switch at a moment's notice, with no real thought seeming to go into it. Certain characters are literally insane, and the motivation of certain characters never make sense. Some do, some really, really don't. Honestly, this book, again, has some decent ideas that, if fleshed out, might make an interesting story. Weak characters really bring this story down, and the cheesy dialogue between the characters doesn't really help either. I'm not sure what else to say. I just didn't really like this book."}, {"userName": "Jennifer  Ricketts (Donnie Darko Girl)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6097206-jennifer-ricketts-donnie-darko-girl", "userReview": "I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review, also posted on my blog, Donnie Darko Girl.Holy shit balls!! This is so much more than a zombie book. I was completely excited and happy to read this book 'cause I. Love. Zombies. I love dystopian, post apocalyptic stories - I can't get enough. If this had simply been a book about the world ending as we know it due to an outbreak turning millions of people into the undead, I would have been thrilled. But this story went way beyond that, and I was left with a dropped jaw. The characters! The plot! The writing! Read on, and you'll see what I mean. First of all, just look at that cover! If I had an ass like that, I wouldn't care if the world had ended!!! ;D The dreads are so awesome, too. I'd stop brushing my hair just like Kansas. Those kinds of details we learn about the characters make them and the story so much more real. I really want to BE Kansas.The story starts off with Kansas and her boyfriend encountering the outbreak at the carnival. I think this was the perfect place to make an eerie beginning even more horrifying. Kansas seemed to know right away what was happening while Malachi was in denial. I'd probably be in denial, too, more out of panic than anything. Maybe not now. Like if this happened tomorrow, I'd probably say, \"Oh god, zombies,\" right away due to all the zombie movies I've seen and books I've read, not to mention my Walking Dead obsession. I'd know right away to shoot zombies in the head. Kansas might seem to be weak having lived alone for so long without venturing too far from home, but I don't think this could be any farther from the truth. How did she not go crazy all of that time without anyone to talk to? Shit obviously went down, too, because from the synopsis you already know she's lost her loved ones. She had to be strong to survive not only emotionally but also physically. She has shelter, food, and clothing. She can kill the famished to protect herself. She seems to have it all handled. Once she does leave and meets Rudy, it comes as a shock to her that people are doing the best they can to keep on living. It was a shock for me, too, because it was the last thing I had ever expected. I think that's one of the aspects that makes Kansas's story so compelling. I felt like the true nature of human beings didn't change even after something so catastrophic as the outbreak of undead. It's so eerie, and I had so many feelings of horror and unease about some of the things Kansas sees. Annie Walls does a perfect job of making you feel the horror, and she does it in a subtle way that struck me much harder and was much more effective than if she had just come out and been explicit. Throughout Taking on the Dead, the question of where humanity goes from here haunted me. Can you truly live again after surviving something like the zombie apocalypse? Just when Kansas believes life can get better, and she can live, too, something even worse than zombies happens...you'll have to grab a copy of this book to find out!"}, {"userName": "Yodamom", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2905141-yodamom", "userReview": "I am going to start off with saying I am not a zombie book reader, well I wasn't. I am a fan of the Walking Dead, TV Show I cringe after every show knowing I have to wait another week to get my fix. What to do ? Well, smart me asked some friends if they knew of any Walking Dead type reads they'd recommend. This was the book I got, by an Indie author I've not heard of before. Cool beans, I love to read 'new' authors. Honestly I didn't have much faith that it would be very interesting to me. I'm a TV zombie fan not a zombie reader. Hah, My good friend Lori, pushed this book and proved to me I can love zombie books. Thank You Lori !Kan, short for Kanas has survived the zombie uprising. She survived her parents, her love and her neighbors. She learned most of what she knows from her survivalist father who most thought a bit crazy. Her strength is amazing, what she has to do to continue to live has been horrendous. Life is on a schedule, everything done at a certain time. Her isolation complete for over 3 years, until a group of humans comes needing her rescue and everything shifts. She must adjust, survive and learn to rebuild her trust in her fellow humans again. It's not easy when many of the humans still alive don't have all their mental faculties anymore.Why did this book take me completely under its spell ? The heroine, she is amazing. She is young in body but so old in her heartbreaks. She has to do the unthinkable, and still keep from going mental. She is adaptive, and cautious, and shy. She is a very believable character. The world is far enough away from reality I felt taken away but similar enough I could relate to it. The supporting characters are complex, with interesting stories that made them so entrancing. It's not a pretty book with prancing unicorns. It has darkness, horrors and violent moments. They are balanced with amazing bits of sunshine that had me smiling with tears in my eyes. This is a full spectrum emotional read. Great News, this is a trilogy, book 2 is out ! I'm off to buy, buy, buy."}, {"userName": "Aoife", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16768476-aoife", "userReview": "I bought this book with great expectations. I was so excited to read it, not only for the kick-ass cover but for Kansas herself, a girl able to survive by herself for 4 years, taking down zombies with machetes and cross-bows. Give me more!However, I was only a few pages in when I knew I was and would continue to be bitterly disappointed. First off, when Harley and co come into it, Kan is all, \"hey guys, come on in to my little bunker, no problem.\" Hello, there has been a zombie apocalypse for four years, and if you have the common sense to survive this long, you should have the common sense to know you probably shouldn't immediately trust a gang when there are all sorts of terrible machete/gun/arrow shooting people out there looking for food and safety which you have! And if these people are staying at your home, why the hell don't you lock your buker basement door to prevent them coming into it in the middle of the night wielding guns and non zombie bitten wives. And also personality changes, Harley went to a nice guy to 'look at your meaty thighs guy' far too easily. I believe if someone is as disgusting as Harley, your gut instinct will tell you, and again, if Kan had survived four years already, she should have a gut instinct telling her if a person is good or not. Like Rudy, now he was good....yet she beat him up a few times. She needs to figure that out.I sometimes felt like when I was reading it, that there were bits missing or some more information could have been added, maybe some description here and there, I'm not too sure, but something was definitely off. I read on another review that this was self published and while I applaud the author for doing so, I think this is a book that could have used some editing by a publishing house to scrap useless bits and suggest better ones to replace.Also, why would you set a zombie on fire in a building that you are trying to gather...just giving yourself way more obstacles to try and avoid and survive.

Lots of action, and humor. Kansas City Sunshine Moore is one bad ass character, that continues to pique interest all the way though. I mean, how could she not with a kick ass name like that?!! I am not usually one for love triangles, at all. I love it when you know the main characters will be forever together, or death til them part. Call me a sap I suppose. But I actually found myself entwined in this crazy triangle that the author, Annie Walls created. She did a fantastic job, and I can not wait to find out what happens to Kan,Rudy, and Mac...plus all of the other awesome characters as well, one of my personal favorites is Reece and Glinda. There is one heck of a twist thrown into this story towards the end, that I did not expect. It was a refreshing, and interesting plot for a sometimes over-used zombie apoc genre. I would recommend this one to anyone who enjoys zombie genre books, and even possibly the dystopian feel.
