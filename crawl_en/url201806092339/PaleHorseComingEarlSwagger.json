Earl\u2019s good buddy Sam Vincent (the lawyer we met in the earlier Black Light...or was it Point of Impact?) has disappeared at the super-mysterious, super-ominous Thebes State Penal Farm (Colored) while on a mission to find a disappeared person for a client. Because Earl is a good friend of Sam\u2019s and just an extremely goodhearted yet utterly badass type of dude he decides to go up to Thebes (inaccessible only by boat or a hellacious trek through swamp) and find out what happened to Sam and what the hell exactly is going on up there.Well there\u2019s a lot of mysteries to Thebes that I would never dream of spoiling but I can comfortably state that it\u2019s a really terrible fucking place, basically a concentration work camp solely for black inmates run by an institution that is like the hick Third Reich all over again. Life is extremely cheap at Thebes and always ends unpleasantly. For chrissakes, the staff goes solely by monikers like the Warden, Bigboy or Section Boss. I could go on and on about what an intense, dark and powerful setting for a thriller Thebes is but you get the point. It\u2019s just the perfect hellhole to put a dude with an unerring moral compass and seemingly god-given gift for violence like Earl Swagger in. There\u2019s generations of wrongs to be put right and you know they will be and through unwaveringly violent means.That\u2019s where the novel, fun bit of this book comes in. It\u2019s a straight up \u201cLimited But Specific Number of Hard Dudes\u201d type scenario. See Seven Samurai, its western counterpart The Magnificent Seven, The Dirty Dozen, etc. (That reminds me...you guys see The Hateful Eight? So awesome.) You got your slow-burn recruitment of the assorted skill sets and personalities, the pre-battle speeches, all of that good stuff. It of course goes without saying that because this is a Stephen Hunter novel it all builds up to a super-slick climax with the usual big ending shootout replaced with like three or four, which was awesome. Yeah...this is pretty much dude fiction, but written with verve and style and intensity."}, {"userName": "Mark Allen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16248423-mark-allen", "userReview": "\"Pale Horse Coming\" is Stephen Hunter's finest hour. While he is an excellent author who never fails to entertain, most of his other work pales in comparison to this masterpiece which is essentially a retelling of \"The Magnificent Seven\" filtered through Hunter's mega-macho and gun-centric writing techniques. In a Stephen Hunter novel, justice almost always comes from the barrel of the gun; in this case, it comes from the barrels of multiple guns as Earl Swagger rounds up a bunch of fellow bullet-blasting bad-asses and sets out to destroy a cesspool of evil and the vicious monsters who rule it.Some have accused Hunter of only writing fantasies for \"gun nuts,\" guys who cream their shorts at the thought of engaging in two-fisted firefights with the scumsucking villains & vermain of the world. And those who make such allegations don't miss the bulls-eye by much...but so what? Novels--at least novels of this type--need be nothing more than escapism, and that's what \"Pale Horse Coming\" offers in bucketfuls. For action-thriller fans who like it bigger than life, over-the-top, and bloody as hell--and yet remarkably well-written--it does not get much better than this.Earl Swagger is a man's man, a soft-spoken southern boy with boulder-size balls who prefers to let his guns talk more than his mouth and who insists on doing the right thing every time, consequences be damned. The world would probably be a better place if there were more folks like Earl Swagger living in it, but one thing is for sure, the literary world is definitely a better place because Stephen Hunter is living in it and you need look no further than \"Pale Horse Coming\" for proof."}, {"userName": "Checkman", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5117003-checkman", "userReview": "As the Swagger novels have gone on the quality has declined. Which is a fairly common thing with all long running series. Be it novels, television, movies etc. \"Pale Horse Coming\" isn't one of Hunter's better novels, but there are aspects that I liked. As others have pointed out this is \"Cool Hand Luke\" meets the \"Magnificent Seven\" with a little bit of William Faulkner thrown in for good measure.The book is written in the style of the tough crime fiction of the 1950's. If you doubt it find yourself some old back issues of \"True\" and \"Argosy\" magazines and read the short stories. Hunter is very faithful in that respect and I suspect this is what turns off some folks. The old pulp fiction of the time was heavy on the testosterone and the refined tastes of many readers in 2013 don't like it. So you have been warned. The dialogue is a bit overblown as are some of the characters. There are times when the writing approaches the level of parody, but the subject matter is serious and treated as such - which keeps it from stepping off the edge. Hunter is a gun enthusiast. A lifelong gun enthusiast. The gunmen that Earl gathers for his return to Thebes are thinly disguised versions of Elmer Keith, Bill Jordan, Ed McGivern, Charles Askins, Jack O'Connor and Audie Murphy. For many readers the only name that will probably be recognizable is that of Audie Murphy. However for those who are firmly embedded in the American Gun Culture and particularly those who have an interest in the bygone days of American shooters (such as me) those other men are famous. Legendary would probably not be too strong of a word actually. I have no doubt that Stephen Hunter grew up reading the many books and articles that were written by those men and I have no doubt they influenced him. In \"Pale Horse Coming\" Hunter takes his boyhood heroes and has them join his creation in a grand, righteous adventure. Being a collector of classic firearms as well as a collector of the old gun periodicals I enjoyed this aspect of the novel. Actually I greatly enjoyed this part of the story. So there you go. A violent,fun,Gothic, macho noir, adventure/action novel with a little history thrown in. William Faulkner meets Mickey Spillane and Louis L'Amour at a luncheon sponsored by the National Rifle Association with an after dinner speech by the NAACP. It's isn't great literature, but it will keep you interested."}, {"userName": "Liralen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1601513-liralen", "userReview": "Mythic and elegant and poetical in language, though deadly earnest in its violence and means of dealing with violence, this book just touched me on all kinds of levels more than just the \"thriller\". It seamlessly blends the myths of the Deep Dark South with that of the cowboy and fast shooters of the West, and I loved how, underlying it all was the root-stock of Oedipus' third play -- Seven Against Thebes, the same stock that upheld \"The Magnificent Seven\" and \"Seven Samurai\".It's odd to read this before Black Light and find the younger Sam Vincent and Earl so much more in this book than they are when portrayed later on in life: more epic, but also more human, more afraid and courageous for it than in the oddly cleaner \"Black Light\". Here everything is far more visceral and gut-wrenching, especially in the first half of the book. I had a much harder time reading the first half than I did the second.The moral choices Earl and Sam make are telling, and extremely hard ones, especially given the situations they go through, and I couldn't help but cheer Earl on.I do give a lot of four stars, but not many fives. This one deserves it for the characters, the utter insanity of the situation, and later on in the utmost and loving detail of the weapons, ammunition, and gun choices of the characters involved in the second half. I love it when you can tell what a character is made of by their choices, and the choices the men make, all of their own initiative, are all telling."}, {"userName": "Steve Vernon", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3052554-steve-vernon", "userReview": "This has got to be one of my favorite Stephen Hunter books as well as one of my favorite reads. I am a sucker for the old \"Magnificent Seven\" set-up - which Stephen Hunter uses in this novel with amazing ease. Definitely will raise your testosterone level after a single reading. You will begin to smell funny and thump on your chest at unexpected moments. I recommend this for anyone who wants to read a good old-fashioned no-nonsense shoot-em-up. There is enough in here to please a fan of action, war, western and all around tough guy fiction.

Part of the violence is to right an injustice where, in the Mississippi of 1951, there is a horrible prison for black men called Thebes State Penal Farm, located in the swamps, almost impossible to reach, except by water. A lawyer friend of Earl Swagger goes there to get some information for a client, and Earl bails him out of trouble, but then can't forget the awful conditions, and rounds up six more gunfighters to go back to Thebes, set the prisoners free, and tear it down. Two strong enemies are Section Boss, and Bigman, an albino of incredible strength."}, {"userName": "Carol Storm", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5032322-carol-storm", "userReview": "Soooooo homoerotic.Soooo melodramatic. There are a lot of problems with Earl Swagger. He's supposed to be a \"John Wayne type\" (not my description, characters in the books actually tell him that to his face -- over and over!) But there are so many ways in which the tough Arkansas lawman never rings true. How come he's a Southerner who refuses to endorse Civil Rights for blacks, but yet he's always somehow punishing racist whites? It's like he'll do anything for blacks but admit that things have to change. How come he's got a wife June whom he \"loves\" but there's never any sign of affection or physical passion or even basic friendship between them? He keeps calling her \"ma'am\" and instead of being gracious it sounds faintly creepy, like he's desperate to keep her at arms length. Well. Having said all that, other Swagger books are better than this one. HAVANA and HOT SPRINGS are both good because Earl has a specific mission and the gun battles are believable within the place and time. The problem with PALE HORSE COMING is that Earl Swagger is being elevated to demi-god status. I mean, overturning an entire prison and bringing thousands of black prisoners back from the dead? And again you sense the born racist trying desperately to make his hero politically correct. Oh, and check out the vicious albino guard Earl has to beat up over and over -- to prove he's not judging people in ways that are all about skin color. I think. After a certain point the whole thing just becomes comical."}, {"userName": "Quinn", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1914235-quinn", "userReview": "I would describe this book as the movies Missing in Action, The Pelican Brief and the Magnificent Seven all rolled into one fantastic story. I picked this book up at a thrift store because it looked interesting. I was greatly surprised. This is a terrific book, with well developed characters. I really liked the fact that Hunter used biographies of real life, well-known gunmen of the 20th century. He changed the last names Elmer Kieth aka: Elmer McKay, Jack O'Conner aka: Jack O'Brien and Audie Murphy aka: Audie Ryan. What a great twist. I actually knew Elmer Keith when I was a young lad.

On the one hand, I enjoy his writing style and his characters. On the other, his books are never quite what I expect they'll be. From the description of this particular book (main character investigates notorious prison, gets capture, escapes and comes back with a private army to exact his vengeance), I thought the story would read much more like the end of First Blood with John Rambo destroying the town single-handedly. But that's not what you get.Yes, Earl Swagger is captured and put through hell by those who run that corrupt prison. And yes, he does escape...so far so good. He even assembles his army. But that's where I was a bit surprised. I expected young guys (maybe his ex-Marine buddies in a military invasion like they must have experienced during their time in WW2) and military tactics. Instead, what I got was really old guys who just wanted to go in and kill the bad guys because...well, they always wanted to kill people and here was finally their chance. One of the members of Earl's army is so infirm that he has to sit in a chair the whole time.What I wanted was a group of soldiers going in to wipe out the bad guys. What I got was a bunch of really old guys (who knew they were going in to commit murder and were okay with that) who happened to be excellent shots and just wanted one more chance to prove it by killing people.Instead of a book with a visceral and cathartic ending where the cavalry came over the hill to save those unjustly imprisoned in Thebes, I was left with a somewhat uncomfortable feeling as a bunch of old guys (who had always secretly wanted to kill someone, but had had the chance recently) went in to commit murder. For me, it didn't feel like a revenge story. And that made it less enjoyable.Is Hunter a good author? Absolutely. Will I read more of his books? Almost certainly. Was this one a good book? Yes. But was it something different than what you expected, given the description on the book's jacket? Unfortunately it was."}, {"userName": "Faye", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4311960-faye", "userReview": "Believable?

Stephen Hunter mixes part southern gothic plus western plus Hunter's own macho/gun loving story lines to craft a pretty good action yarn. Hunter keeps the story moving by going between Earl Swagger's POV and that and Swagger's friend/mentor Sam, a local lawyer. The book culminates (big surprise for a Hunter novel) in a shoot out with an especially violent battle (consider yourself warned-- multiple axes are involved--yes not for the squeamish). Per usual, Hunter's writing allows what in lesser hands would be a dime story novel quality novel and makes it into a more decent, definetly readable and entertaining story. Two caveats--per Hunter's ultra male writing style--dialogue is not great and suspension of disbelief requires characteres to undertake unclear and dangerous adventures, pretty much because Earl Swagger asks. Other point is the character of Sam. For being a supposedly wise and accomplished southern lawyer, Sam comes across as being incredibly naive and not seeming to understand the world in which he supposedly lives. While he is definetly a different man than Earl, the character could have been drawn in such away that Sam did not appear to such a lesser man, that it is hard to understand Earl's respect."}, {"userName": "Loretta Gibson", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58263228-loretta-gibson", "userReview": "Hunter has created a very believable crusader in Earl Swagger.Sam Vincent, Earl's mentor, has been retained by an attorney to find an heir, who is a black man.

Earl would have had Sam safe at home in no time, but due to Sam ridicules request that Earl kills no one, things go to hell in a hand basket. You have an army of men who would kill you in a heartbeat, sic the dogs on you and laugh while they tear you to pieces. Not kill anyone....what planet is Sam from.

This novel ranks up there with the greatest I've ever read, and it probably made Earl Swagger a bigger hero than he was on Iwo, earning the Medal of Honor. If ever an author has built frustration and rage in his readers that was ultimately assuaged by retribution, 'Pale Horse Coming' is the perfect product. Now I know that the state of Mississippi has taken it on the chin for a century and a half as the last bastion of the Confederacy-and slavery-and 'Pale Horse Coming' ain't gonna reverse the trend. I spent a few months in coastal Mississippi as a younger man, and when I left I never wanted to look back. That's saying something for a boy born in Charleston, SC, where the Civil War began, but it's what I took away from 'being there,' stunned beyond belief when I met the black Biloxi Chief of Police one night late at a restaurant who didn't think it unusual for 1975. Based on Stephen Hunter's perspective, moving twenty miles inland made all the difference in the world. I guess the Biloxi Chief of Police prepared me for Reuben Greenberg, the black Charleston Chief of Police beginning in 1982, universally heralded among Charlestonians as the finest police chief in the country during his 23 year tenure. But this ain't about admirable lawmen, it's about decadent purveyors of evil disguised as officers of the law. WWII Medal of Honor winner Earl Swagger's boss and surrogate father Sam Vincent is retained by a Chicago client to investigate the disappearance of a friend in Thebes Town, De Soto County, Mississippi. The case will be solved and full retainer paid upon presentation of an official document stating Lincoln Tilson's fate. Due diligence reveals that Thebes is also the location of the former Bonverite Plantation, now the Thebes State Penal Farm (Colored), where the hard core black prisoners are sent-and never heard from again. Getting there from Polk County Arkansas is nearly impossible, but Sam Vincent endures inconvenience and unpleasantness to finally make it to Thebes, all but a deserted ghost town occupied by very scared black people who live in the shadows. Turns out there's a Sheriff of Thebes, and his organization is the antithesis of user-friendly. Sam ends up in jail accused on the shabbiest murder setup in history. Of course he has no rights, as Sheriff Leon Gattis assures him of being transferred to the State Penal Farm upriver a mile if he makes a nuisance by asserting any civilized rights. Earl is surveilling Thebes during Sam's incarceration, putting together a plan to spring him from the hoosegow and escaping Mississippi forever. The plan would have worked to perfection if Sam hadn't made Earl swear he wouldn't shoot and kill either the tracker dogs or the deputies. Sam gets away on a railroad boxcar heading north, but Earl is caught, beaten and nearly lynched before the Penal Farm Warden sends his Superintendent out to bring Earl in for a closer inspection. The level of indignity and suffering inflicted upon Earl Swagger at Thebes Penal Farm (Colored) is far worse than that routinely described at WWII Japanese or German prisoner of war camps. But this is impenetrable southern Mississippi, immune from oversight and the secret laboratory of Doctor David Goodwin Stone, former CO of the 2809th Tropical Disease Research Unit. Now it's Fort Dietrich's equivalent of Colonel Kurtz' compound in 'Apocalypse Now.' Stone pursues his mission of perfecting the weaponization of the syphilis bacteria for use against potential enemies of the US. He's actually lost his mind, infecting prisoners with the bacteria and watching as symptoms of various strains kill them. But his work is hidden for a while until a friendly Penal Farm trustee helps Earl escape. Once out and healing, Earl Swagger begins planning his return to Thebes, its destruction, the freeing of the prisoners and the death of the diabolical and satanic staff that operates it. He does a fair bit of traveling, enlisting six of the most deadly gunslingers who ever lived, offering 'em one last chance at the OK Corral. He also enlists Audie Murphy, the hero of WWII in Europe, who's happy to take a break from Hollywood to eradicate Satan. Now scenes of the old farts at Earl's leased Florida ranch days before the attack are as hilarious as 'The Odd Couple.' But aided by Earl's former sailor buddy, now Chief of Naval Aviation, the attack squad gets secreted in place by three Navy helicopters, precluding any advance alarm by the Penal Farm staff. The attack goes as planned, but the sadistic Penal Farm Superintendent Bigboy takes four axes in the body before he gives up the ghost, having taken off the top of Earl's left ear permanently with his nine foot leather whip. Thebes isolation is also its death sentence, as the Pale Horse attack also blew the levee that protected the plantation fields from the Chickasawhay River, hence the entire Penal Farm and plantation are swept away by the flooding waters. Days later the Penal Farm resupply boat will find no trace of it or the town, the fifty-member guard staff, the Sheriff's office, the black residents, nothing. And Ft Dietrich will have to deny ever having a detachment at Thebes investigating the use of syphilis as a weapon. When Earl returns to his home in Polk County Arkansas, he is a changed man, his wanderlust apparently permanently slaked as he once again becomes a loving husband and father. Oh, the Chicago client, Davis Trugood, or Bonverite in French, surreptitiously travels to Thebes, confronts his half-brother and Warden Cleon Bonverite as the attack begins, killing one another just before the old plantation house goes up in flames.

But, he totally lost my interest when he fictionalized characters that were thinly veiled and incorrect for those people's true identities, which anyone who has read the gun magazines in the last 50 years would recognize. This occurred at the end, and was accompanied by an unlikely and impossible scene that turned me against this book."}], "description": "The Year is 1951. A smooth-talking Chicago lawyer has come to chat with Sam Vincent, a former prosecutor, about a dangerous unknown - a prison for violent black convicts in Thebes, Mississippi, a place of many questions but no answers. Would Sam, a white man and a Southerner, be willing to investigate? When Sam vanishes in the mists and swamps, his old friend Earl Swagger packs his gun and heads to Thebes where he discovers sinister secrets that go far beyond the prison walls. The whole town guards itself from nosy strangers with a private army of brutal, gun-toting, Klan-type thugs and rednecks. After barely escaping, Earl vows to right things and reclaim Thebes from the throes of a sinister conspiracy. But first, he enlists just a little help from his friends. Featuring the same fast-paced action and page-turning thrills that made Hot Springs a heart-stopping bestseller, Pale Horse Coming is a triumphant successor.", "title": "Pale Horse Coming\n      \n          (Earl Swagger #2)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/95381.Pale_Horse_Coming", "average": 4.24, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1315656701l/95381.jpg", "reviews": 186, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/12546.Stephen_Hunter", "name": "Stephen Hunter"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Thriller", "Mystery", "Action", "Mystery"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/95381.Pale_Horse_Coming", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/528947.Pale_Horse_Coming", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/777524.Pale_Horse_Coming", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5304910-pale-horse-coming", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/127712.Point_of_Impact", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/770288.Time_to_Hunt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6379549-i-sniper", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/531675.Black_Light", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7841445-dead-zero"]}
