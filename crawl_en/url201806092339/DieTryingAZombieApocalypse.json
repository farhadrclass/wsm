I am a HUGE zombie fan! I literally just finished it. I was so excited to see what goodies Nick had in store for us this time around. And he does not disappoint. This thriller had suspense, action,laugh worthy moments, zombies and so much more. If you loved the first book, you will enjoy this book also. These guys are trying to stay alive and you must read to see if they make it or not! a truly gripping story! I could see this series as movie :-) Great job again Nick!

The first part of this story that hooked me immediately taking place during a violent thunder storm in the pitch black of night, where our military guys were trying to track down a mysterious sound in the air, I really thought that was all the story was going to be for awhile and I would have been totally alright with that. Under constant fear the zombies would hear or find them and ruin their day. Nicholas Ryan bring forth a new type of zombie to my ears, the kind that will eat each other, one was wounded and suddenly the horde stops advancing, moaning turning to growling, and then they converged upon the wounded and tore it to shreds in an all out ravenous feeding frenzy. If that wasn't enough for you Ryan was able to create characters that really spoke to me with their complex histories and a certain mystery surrounding a few of them. My only criticism is that this audiobook was way too short, so many other avenues could have been explored. I highly recommend Die Trying: A Zombie Apocalypse, but only if you are looking for a quick listen that is really fast paced, full of action, tons of suspense and different than your usual zombies. As I said earlier I have already purchased Ground Zero: A Zombie Apocalypse an earlier release because Ryan was able to rouse something in me that few other authors have.Audiobook provided for review by the publisher."}, {"userName": "Jo Carter", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32394375-jo-carter", "userReview": "This is my first *real* zombie book. The Death Cure had \"cranks\" in it, their version of zombies which take longer to go insane but honestly, they seem tame compared to the zombies in this book. And what an excellent first zombie book it was. Rating it only on entertainment value I'd give it 5 stars. I was thoroughly wrapped in the story; it clawed it's way into my mind and wouldn't let go. There were, however, a few things which made me keep the rating at 4 stars (possibly even 4.5). The first being the once or twice the narration head hopped from Mitch to another character. It wasn't much, only one line at a time, but it still stood out to me. I would have liked Mitch's name to be mentioned more. I kind of feel like Mitch is a separate person from the narrator, but I do remember his name :) The second, more plot-wise things would be the pulled tooth (entertaining, and I definitely felt all the emotions of Jed, but I wasn't sure why it needed to be there), the disturbing old man (which was definitely a chilling and gripping read, but again I wasn't sure what purpose it had to the plot. I did like the message it gave about humans though), and finally the wife/daughter shock (because it wasn't hinted at or Mitch didn't show any emotions, it didn't feel real to me. Like something tacked on at the end). However, despite saying all of that, I was hooked. I'll definitely read zombie novels again, and definitely more of Nicholas Ryan's. It scared me (but didn't terrify me in real life - which I was grateful for!), and kept me guessing. The description was amazing, and I loved all the metaphors which really made me understand and feel like I knew what the characters were going through."}, {"userName": "Cyn", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4122566-cyn", "userReview": "[was open, left up to you, I guess, to decide whether the protagonist lived or died.

While the characters themselves were not that interesting, their interactions, primarily the two brothers in the story, were intriguing. A big problem the book has is that during some of the darkest and most \"powerful\" moments in the story, the dialogue felt a bit forced and ruined their effect. The story does have a couple of surprising twists and turns that made it unpredictable at times which is definitely a plus.If you are looking for a survival-horror masterpiece then you should look elsewhere. On the other hand, if you're looking for a decent distraction with some OK-action moments, you could do worse than this book."}, {"userName": "Rachel Hilgenberg", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21260735-rachel-hilgenberg", "userReview": "Kept Me Tense ThroughoutThough we don't get as much zombie action as in some books, the terror of the people came through and it made it much more intense.

But I was wrong.\"  Mitch, Die Trying by Nicholas Ryan, pg. 129.Nicholas Ryan's Die Trying is an adrenalin pumping ride that has you in it's grip from the first page and well beyond the last. It is extremely well written with intriguing characters and a relentless storyline.When Mitch, his brother Jed, and Harrigan hear the sound of a helicopter overhead after several weeks of nothing during the zombie apocalypse, they know that it may be their only way to find a safe haven for survivors. But as it turns out, Zombies aren't the only things they need to worry about.The story is told from Mitch's perspective, who seems to be the groups unofficial spearhead. To say he and Jed aren't close, is an understatement and the dynamics between the two add to the stress of the situation they find themselves in. Jed is a menacing presence throughout the story. He is the antagonist in the group and is just waiting for the moment he can come out on top. Harrigan fluctuates between being a calm, deep thinking, steady presence, with a strong belief in his bible, to a skittish, nervous fellow, which is totally understandable considering the horror around him.Nicholas Ryan has done a tremendous job in making the reader feel part of the group. We learn the background events as Mitch, Jed and Harrigan do, so there is no loss of pace or slowing of heartbeats as you read along. This gives the book as a whole, a more tangible feel that matches in with the timeline of the story. It is a well developed story with descriptive prose that allows you to smell the fear, and the decaying flesh as well as hear the spray of bullets, and the shuffling stride of the dead woman coming closer. Die Trying by Nicholas Ryan has a true fear factor that doesn't come from the blood and flesh seeking zombies, but from a humans ability to hate, to plot revenge, to be ultimately selfish during a catastrophic event. Nicholas Ryan has done a truly terrific job of writing a horror story where the monsters are not the real monsters at all.Visit Kota's Book Kollection at http://kotasbookkollection.blogspot.c..."}, {"userName": "Tiffany Readz", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11659152-tiffany-readz", "userReview": "I was given a copy of Die Trying for an honest review and honestly, I really liked it! I am not a Walking Dead fan or any type of paranormal reader (any more), more of a romance reader. Yes I kept hoping there was going to be some sort of romantic twist, however there wasn't and I still liked the story.There is one thing I really like in an author and that is description. Nicholas Ryan is an extremely descriptive writer, so much so I felt like I was watching a zombie movie in my head. The book isn't focused solely on zombies, rather a group of people trying to survive as the world crumbles around them.We join Mitch, his brother Jed and another survivor Harrigan twenty-three days into a zombie apocalypse. The men have been holed up in a house, but now that their supplies are dwindling down, they need to make a plan to move. In the distance they hear a helicopter trying to land and wait to see what happens with it.Once the helicopter lands, the men now have to decide if they are going to risk their lives for the life that may or may not be in the helicopter. The zombies are drawn to noise and blood, so upon hearing the landing, they are already on the way.We go on a journey of survival with Mitch, Jed and Harrigan, written so well it feels like we are right there in the streets with them. There are so many obstacles in the way of the precious freedom they are searching for. Besides the chaos going on around them, there is thick tension between Mitch and Jed and at times Jed and Harrigan. Mitch and Jed have family problems that Jed wants solved after it's is all over.I really liked this book, not my usual genre. At. All. However like I mentioned earlier, it is just so well written it kept me interested the whole way through and I couldn't wait to see if they were going to survive. There are a few twists in the plot line that kept things pretty interesting as well. If you are fan of zombies this is for you. If you are a fan of survival stories this is for you. If you are a fan of a well written, action packed books, give Die Trying a chance!"}, {"userName": "Mark Allen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16248423-mark-allen", "userReview": "I felt Nicholas Ryan's debut, \"Ground Zero,\" was one of the best zombie novels ever penned, so I was dying to read his sophomore effort and jumped at the opportunity to do so like a starving puma pouncing on helpless prey.So many zombie authors (uh, that's authors who write zombie fiction, not authors who are actually zombies; just wanted to clarify) attempt to nail the winning formula of undead mayhem, high-voltage action, grisly gore, and human drama, but few pull it off with the level of skill that Ryan brings to the ghoul-and-gore game.A couple twists in the 2nd half jacked up the enjoyment ante. Granted, I accurately predicted one of them (not the specifics, but the general gist) while the other one sucker-punched me like an uppercut from a professional boxer catching me right in my blind spot and knocking me for a loop.The zombies sort of play second-fiddle here; while the tale takes place in the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse, the primary threat is completely human, with lies and betrayals and simmering rage festering within the dynamic of the small group of survivors. In other words, the undead might be the primary threat, but they almost pale in comparison to the immediate threat the hero faces from his own enraged--and extremely dangerous--brother. And then there's the crazy old man ... but it's better if you make his acquaintence for yourself.So yes, there is a plethora of zombie-vs.-humans sequences, but greater focus is given to the threat of man's savagery against fellow man.Zombie fiction is both fertile literary ground as well as a barren wasteland. There are plenty of authors doing excellent work in the genre ... and others who seemingly have no brain in their heads judging from the quality of their output. Trust me, Nicholas Ryan is one of the former and nowhere near the latter. It's possible you will read a better zombie novel in 2014 ... but it's more likely you won't."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7066601-heather", "userReview": "Really great book. I believe this is the second book in the Ground Zero: A Zombie Apocalypse.Trapped amidst the horror of the zombie apocalypse, three men hear the sound of a helicopter overhead and know it represents their last desperate hope to survive the terror and reach safety. But survival comes at a cost - and the undead hordes that ravage the world are not the only lurking evil the men must face. But for Mitch Logan, his brother, Jed, and their friend, Clinton Harrigan, there is no choice. They must fight to survive - or Die Trying. Mitch and his brother, Jed, are trying to just live another day in the HELL that is the now, the Zombie Apocalypse. They hear a helicopter over head, that seems to be trying to land, due to trouble. The questions are abundant, where is it trying to go, where did it come from, who is aboard it.They make mad, life fearing dashes to get to the helicopter as it is about to descend and crash. There only hope that someone is still alive when they get there. Their only chance for possible survival is to find out where this thing was heading.If I keep going, I am going to give too much away, and that would take away your fun of reading it.Just take my word for it, if you read the first one, then you have to read this one. If you haven't read the first one, well get with it and get reading.It's quick, fast paced and keeps you holding your breath at times when there seems to be no more hope.*a copy of this ebook was provided to me for an honest review, and thank you so much for that, I really enjoyed this one."}, {"userName": "Roxanne Kade", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5948499-roxanne-kade", "userReview": "I've said this before, and I'm going to say it again...I'm not a huge fan of zombies, but if I'm looking for a bit of flesh eating, brain chomping zombie gore, then Nicholas Ryan is the author I'll turn to. His first book was amazing, so when I got the opportunity to read more from this talented author, I jumped at the chance.Ryan's stories are well developed with plenty of gut-wrenching twists and turns. The suspenseful atmosphere he creates with his plotlines is so thrilling and kept me on the edge of my seat from page one. I felt like I was a part of this story. I felt like I ran alongside the characters as they sought refuge and safety, and to my delightful horror I felt like I was right in the mix of things each time a zombie\u2019s gnashing teeth came a little too close for comfort. But the danger that threatens the characters is not only from the infected undead. Hate, disloyalty and a lack of trust are just some of the factors plaguing this group of survivors. The biggest question was will they survive each other long enough to survive the apocalypse? There were quite a few disturbing moments within this story, and even more frightening than the zombies was the old man, Mitch, encountered on their way to Pentelle. He was a crazed lunatic, and that\u2019s putting it mildly. It definitely upped the creepiness and once again added another layer to this complex story.This was an exciting and enthralling read.

This was the 2nd book I've read from Mr Ryan and it was another heart stopping read from page one. Nick creates fantastic believable characters introducing Harrison a big burly Christian man and 2 brothers Jed and Mitch who are on the run fighting for survival from humans infected with the jaws virus. With a clever addition in that the dead not only turn into flesh eating zombies, but can hunt their prey successfully too.What makes this book more unique is that it centers around a helicopter crash and the rescue of its occupants. When Harrison and the brothers discover Clive Walker and his daughter Millie alive with a dead pilot, things are definitely not what they seem.But as with any zombie apocalypse it's not just the zombies that you need to fear; with a brilliant parallel twist running through the plot with Jed; who after 10 yrs in one of the toughest prisons is seeking revenge on his brother Mitch, keeping us all gripped.I grew to really like Mitch and Harrigan's character's but felt I wanted more from Millie.This brilliant fast paced creative action-fest is delivered in dramatic detail and plenty of gore to keep every zombieholic happy. Offering clear vision to whats going on so you can almost smell that rotten flesh. This was so fast paced I found myself holding my breath a few times.The ending is just fantastic and didn't see it coming, loved it.A Die Trying 2 would be fab, but its also a great stand alone read too."}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1342527-jill", "userReview": "The suspense of Die Trying starts with Ryan's detail to word choice in the opening scene: the description of a character, his movement, the sound that he heard, and the first word he spoke. I was hooked, and I had to keep reading.As Mitch, the main character, told the story, I felt like I was walking behind him (thankfully) peering over his shoulder as though I was a part of the action or conversation.The action was amazing! In many of the scenes, out of shock or fear, I found myself yelling out, covering my mouth, and even wanting to cover my eyes.I enjoyed each character and became invested in each one: the devout Christian, the brothers (good v evil), a mystery man and a teenage girl. Lets not forget the old man and his underwear! Ryan does a wonderful job getting the reader invested as each character shares their story and each story will have one sitting on the edge of their seat wondering how it will unfold in the end.The book is fast paced, but the end is really-really intense. The story lines that had me wondering throughout the book came together perfectly and were so unexpected - jaw dropping! The ending is brilliant! By far my favorite book written by Nicholas Ryan. I look forward to future books written by Nicholas Ryan."}, {"userName": "\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043a\u043e\u0432", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2015", "userURL":

Nicholas Ryan is getting better and better with every book in his Zombie apocalyps world!You get caught by the story the instant you start with the first page. The point of view while reading gets the reader on eye-level with the characters.

You nearly feel the fear, panic, pain and thrilling moments Mitch and the little group of survivors in this small peace of the country have to get through. The more i got to the end the more i couldn't lay it down and got hooked and shocked with every twist and further part of the story!!

Nicholas Ryan's Ground Zero was the first zombie book I ever read and I couldn't wait to read this one. I was not disappointed either! I liked the fact that the cast of characters was not very large, so it's easy to feel emotions for them as you read. Other books I have read have so many characters that I don't feel invested in them too much. It is also good for me that I never knew where Nicholas was going in this book. Just like with movies, I will make a guess as to what I think will happen, and I always love it when I am wrong. I was wrong at pretty much every turn in Die Trying.Nicholas also does a fantastic job of describing the scenes and getting emotions to come alive off the page.

This was my 2nd Horror/Zombie Novel I've read and Nicholas Ryan's writing truly captivates you.

The antagonist doesn't do much except \"grunt,\" \"look with rage in his eyes,\" and \"seethe.\" The hapless victim \"fidgets,\" \"flails,\" and \"looks terrified.\" The narrator is not a person so much as a device for keeping the plot going - he doesn't have any discerning characteristics, he is weak when it serves the plot, he is the leader of the company when it serves the plot, and he is superhumanly strong when it serves the plot.Two stars because the audiobook narrator was amazing and made this lackluster miss come alive a little bit."}, {"userName": "Missy Goodsell", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17653851-missy-goodsell", "userReview": "I was given a free copy of Die Trying for a honest review.

I wasn't left out in the cold wondering what or how to imagine things in my minds eye, it was very imaginable and I was able to close my eye & picture it exactly how it was happening.

There seem to be overly detailed parts where time slows ridiculously and parts where time seems to just disappear. The end scene doesn't make much sense. Jed is stuck on the road yet it's no problem for an almost dead Mitch and young Jessica to just coast to safety. And I can't take the psychotic old man scene very seriously either. He's very careful of Mitch and then suddenly... not. Also the author describes Jed as being a rather dumb and ignorant brut throughout the story but near the end \"cunning\", hmmm, an awkwardly forboded and rather boring and obvious nemesis."}, {"userName": "Samantha", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4604976-samantha", "userReview": "I really enjoyed the first one and when the chance came to get a shot at the second for free...Uhm of course I would read it and post a review.
