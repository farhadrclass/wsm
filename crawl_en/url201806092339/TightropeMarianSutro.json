NPR was just beginning a segment on Russia's quiet but steady build up of a missile defense system, and its not so quiet military intervention in Syria, its aggression in Crimea. An interview with General Frank Gorenc, commander of the U.S. Air Force in Europe and Africa, revealed the extent to which the United States is wringing its hands over Russia's beefing up of its military. \"De-conflicting\" is the term the General used. Is that an actual word? \nDe-confliction\n (see what I did there?) is what some Cold War spies had in mind when they became double agents, trading secrets on a moral high ground. They reasoned that if enemy countries had equal access to the most terrible things science and engineering could manufacture, a balance of power would be achieved, a peace wrung out of duplicity. It's fine not to have read Trapeze the prequel to Tightrope, but really, you should. For it is there we first meet Marian Sutro, a young\u2014very young\u2014French-English girl recruited as an English spy during WWII. She parachutes into France at the height of the war and, well, read the novel. It's excellent. In Tightrope, we meet Marian two years after that moonlit drop into a war zone. She is still quite young in years, but in spirit she is weary, nearly broken by torture and captivity. Tightrope moves at a ponderous pace, mirroring Marian's burden of grief, guilt, and the surreal return to the land of the living. Threading flashbacks and flash-forwards into the narrative, Mawer does a masterful job of adding dimensions of tension to the plot and emotional depth to his characters. There is awkwardness in the perspective interruption of a childhood admirer of Marian's, who steps in to provide background and exposition in odd and cloying segments. I'd rather have been left alone with Marian. But it does not detract significantly from the powerful, tender, graceful and aching character study of Marian Sutro. The initial turgidity also reflects the dullness of England after the war\u2014the excitement and urgency of the battle is over, replaced by the belt-tightening of life on rations, the chin down, bear-up of cleaning and restoring battered and bombed city streets.Now that Marian has returned, desperately seeking anonymity, avoiding any claim of heroism, she is bereft of purpose, at times sustained, at times nearly crushed under the weight of wartime memories. She takes an innocuous job at a library, marries a solid former pilot-now-tire-salesman, and fails at settling into a normal life. Haunted by her tortures and deeds, she casts about for a reason to keep on, to look forward instead of behind. In steps MI6 to fill the void. Marian is re-recruited as a spy. This time the enemy is behind the Iron Curtain and the crisis is one of proportions hard to grasp: total nuclear annihilation.The cat-and-mouse plot moves forward like a slow-moving river with deadly currents hidden beneath murky waters, but what is most fascinating is the cat-and-mouse game Marian plays with her own soul. In Trapeze she was an ing\u00e9nue. In Tightrope she is a cool seductress, at ease with slipping in and out of character, down side streets, into the night. It is fascinating to read historical fiction about the infancy of the Cold War some thirty years after its limping, anti-climactic conclusion, knowing that here we are, still looking askance at Russia with Syria and the Crimea caught between the rocks and hard places of rattling sabers, Putin slapping his bare chest, and the machinations of diplomacy. Simon Mawer reminds us that behind the engine of intrigue are human beings, motivated by and acting on entirely human impulses."}, {"userName": "Hugh", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32318315-hugh", "userReview": "This is the sequel to The Girl Who Fell From The Sky (also known as Trapeze), which was a literary thriller that told the story of Marian Sutro, a young SOE agent in Nazi-occupied France. This book continues the story, starting with her capture and survival in a German camp. The first part of the story is probably the most fully realised, dealing with her return to England and the difficulties in readjusting to the mundane reality of life at home. She gets drawn into working as a secret agent, working for both the British and the Russians - this allows Mawer to explore the nuances of the post-war nuclear arms race, while toying with spy thriller genre writing. For me the whole thing worked surprisingly well - if anything this one is better than the first book."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5837456-susan", "userReview": "\u201cTo Live Happily, Live Hidden.\u201dThis novel sees the return of Marian Sutro, who first appeared in, \u201cThe Girl Who Fell From the Sky.\u201d Having survived the war, Marian returns to an England where people are more concerned with shortages and getting back to normal, than with those returning. Although Marian returns to her family, she feels distanced from them. To some she is a heroine \u2013 the recipient of medals and a source of vicarious excitement \u2013 but she prefers to retain a distance from the award ceremonies and public acclaim. The author wonderfully shows how Marian is living two different lives and torn between them; both trying to cope with her new life in a new world, but also feeling that she needs to give evidence at war crimes trials.When the atomic bomb finally ends the war in the Pacific, Marian is shocked. Characters that appeared in the first novel also appear here \u2013 including Marian\u2019s brother Ned and Clement Pelletier \u2013 and their research into the new weapons which herald the new age of nuclear weapons. Approached by Major Fawley, Marian has to admit that she is bored and unable to let go of her old life. As the Cold War begins, Marian finds herself both being seduced and the seducer. In this book we hear both what happened to her when she was arrested and her continued life in espionage. If you enjoyed, \u201cThe Girl Who Fell From the Sky,\u201d then you will certainly like this. It is an atmospheric, and realistic, continuation of Marian\u2019s story.

Sorry to say that I abandoned this one."}, {"userName": "switterbug (Betsey)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2843912-switterbug-betsey", "userReview": "The cloistered world of spies has long been a hot-seller of fiction and literature. Some authors concentrate on a twisty plot, others on the enigmatic personality of a spy. In TIGHT ROPE, the follow-up to TRAPEZE, Simon Mawer does both with equal ability. Although primarily character-driven, with the life of British spy Marian Sutro at the center, Mawer does a satisfying job of creating a taut atmosphere, and he does so with lean, precise prose and the heady atmosphere of the Cold War. He also delves into Marian\u2019s work in WW II, as he goes back and forth in time. As the book opens in the early millennium, Marian is a woman in her eighties, being interviewed by a man from her past. He wants to tie up loose ends. It\u2019s obvious that he was once enchanted by this woman, and played a small but peripheral part of her past, but there were holes, or lacunae, he wanted to fill in. This is Marian\u2019s story, and the gentleman, her scribe.Marian was half-British, half-French, a perfect contender for parachuting into German-occupied France during WW II. She was adept at the rigors of fieldwork--killing; masking; carrying messages; and the use of explosives. At times, I felt like I was in a movie. A good movie, but nothing too original, plot-wise. Yet, it led me along because Mawer is an expert in pacing and character, and just when I think I\u2019ll predict what is ahead (and sometimes I do), I find that I am intrigued by Marian and her disquiet. Marian was sensible and pragmatic at times, but occasionally quixotic. She had multiple lovers, and an early marriage to a PR pilot. She talks about the horrifying torture she received at the hands of the Germans with as equal intensity as her ardor for particular men that she met in the course of her work. She was captured by the Germans after being betrayed by an associate. She wasn\u2019t certain who it was.At the age of 23, when the war was over, Marian\u2019s adjustment to quotidian life became a struggle. She lived with her brother, a scientist, who she realized was in the wrong place at the wrong time, being pulled in to espionage on the fringes. Marian became a part of Cold War espionage, which pulled her in various directions at once. The lives of spies, and the masks of subterfuge, are riveting at times. Double agents, triple agents, keeping it straight, and trying not to get killed or tortured in the process, keeps the atmosphere both chilling and hot. Marian Sutro is a sympathetic character, closed off from people around her, yet with a flinty kind of passion, too, mixed with her duty she felt to protect the ones she loved.It\u2019s difficult to give this a 5 star, however, because I\u2019ve read some of the best of the best spy novels, HARLOT\u2019S GHOST being the undisputed champion (by American Norman Mailer). Nothing seems to compare with the layers of the psyche (in this case, American) that created and sustained the CIA, and a more believable story, altogether. The posing, which is elementary to the fieldwork, is more convincing. It's not just \"what\" they did, but the core of the human character that shifts reflexively. Banville and DeLillo have also written outstanding spy novels. Mawer\u2019s is more of a mainstream crowd-pleaser, one that could find its way into cinema. And, certainly more weighty than a Bond movie.\u201cIt felt like walking a tightrope, feeling the balance, knowing that a slight shift to either side might be fatal.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Cathy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7510544-cathy", "userReview": "Based on the book description, I was anticipating an enthralling Cold War spy story in the manner of John Le Carr\u00e9 and I certainly got that in the final third of the book. What I wasn\u2019t expecting was such a devastating portrait of the lasting impact of their experiences on those who, like Marian, performed undercover roles in the Second World War.Our narrator is Sam, who first encounters Marian when he is a child (as a friend of his mother), later when he is an impressionable teenager and finally when he is an adult but still slightly in thrall to her. Marian\u2019s story, as presented to the reader, is part her testimony, part Sam\u2019s first-hand experience, part evidence he has gleaned from official files and part his recreation of how he imagines events may have taken place. The reader is never entirely sure which. Of course, part of Marian\u2019s undercover role involved presenting herself as someone she wasn\u2019t, living an acquired identity, never really being herself. \u2018That was the problem with words \u2013 they nailed the thought down, made it explicit, fixed it, crucified it on the cross of exact meaning. But life has no exact meanings, only shades of meaning, hints, versions and contradictions, s confusion of loves and hates, of motives and desires.\u2019 What is the true story?The author convincingly portrays Marian\u2019s difficulty in adjusting to \u2018normal\u2019 life and overcoming the psychological, physical and emotional scars she bears as a result of her terrible experiences: arrest, interrogation, torture and, ultimately, confinement in the Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp. Marian feels a sense of dislocation from other people. \u2018It was just indifference, a sensation of estrangement from the ordinary matters of human contact. Conversation with anyone felt like trying to talk to people in a foreign language when you only have a fraction of the vocabulary at your disposal and half the grammar.\u2019 It is as if a yawning gulf separates her from the rest of humanity: \u2018And she felt something strange, the sensation of uniqueness. It wasn\u2019t a good feeling, just one of separation\u2019.It\u2019s not just Marian who has been changed by the war. The author gives us an evocative and comprehensive picture of the impact of the war on people, places, geopolitics, political and philosophical argument, technology and much else. Even small things, like the way people interact:\u2018\u201cWhere are you from, then?\u201d the barman asked.No stranger ever asked a question like that last time she was in the city. Questions drew you into other people\u2019s stories, got you involved, got you into trouble. Now no one cared.\u2019Marian and her brother, Ned, are appalled by the use of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the prospect of the United States developing the technology still further. In particular, Marian is plagued by guilt that her actions during the war might unwittingly contribute to a repetition of the horrors she has already witnessed, but multiplied a hundredfold. This guilt propels Marian down a path of secrets, lies and betrayal that will require the use of all the skills and tradecraft she acquired in preparation for her wartime exploits. Like how to fashion a weapon out of what\u2019s to hand, how to tell if you\u2019re being followed and how to shake off your followers. It will put her in danger and make her question who, if anyone, she can trust so that carefully planning each small move, each sentence uttered, becomes critical.\u2018She waited a moment, looking at him. And then she made her move. It felt like walking a tightrope, feeling the balance, knowing that a slight shift either side might be fatal. She reached her foot forward and poised to transfer her weight onto it, feeling the rope wobbling. No safety net.\u2019I loved Tightrope. I was completely drawn into Marian\u2019s story although the romantic in me would have liked a slightly different outcome for her and the man who becomes such an important part of her life. However, the path the author chose for her was admittedly more true to her character. I haven\u2019t read the first book in the series, The Girl Who Fell From The Sky (published under the title Trapeze in the United States), so I don\u2019t have the benefit of knowing how much of this book repeats events from the earlier one. What I do know is that Tightrope works brilliantly as a standalone read and from the very beginning I got that comforting feeling that I was in the hands of a skilled writer and accomplished storyteller."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1299766-karen", "userReview": "I was first introduced to Simon Mawer through an interview with Diane Rehm about his book The Glass Room, which was also nominated for The Man Booker Prize.

In October last year I went to the Boston Book Festival and Simon Mawer was there talking about his latest book Tightrope, which I learned was a sequel to Trapeze.

That book described the WWII experiences of Marian Sutro who is trained as a resistance fighter and ended ambiguously. This book takes up her story and follows it during the cold war, shifting in time and point of view between present and post war Britain. It's amazing to note that Simon Mawer was born in 1948 and didn't personally experience that time, so well does he bring it to life. Marian is a complex character, well suited for the material."}, {"userName": "Roger Brunyate", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42294189-roger-brunyate", "userReview": "[Marian Sutro, the protagonist of both books, is only in her teens when she is recruited by the Special Operations Executive to train as an agent to be dropped into occupied France to work with the Resistance during WW2. The daughter of an English father and French mother, she spent much of her adolescence in Geneva, and is perfectly bilingual. There were in fact several dozen such female agents in the War. The most famous of them, Odette Sansom, was the subject of a British biopic in 1950, and makes a brief appearance here. She was probably an inspiration for Mawer in writing of the rather younger Marian Sutro, whose exploit takes a similar trajectory: some months of success, arrest and torture by the Gestapo, imprisonment in Fresnes and Ravensbr\u00fcck, and near-miraculous escape. Indeed at the end of Trapeze, the reader is virtually sure that Marian is dead. One special aspect of Marian's story is that, through her family and in particular her brother Ned, who is a theoretical physicist, she is friends with the French atom scientist Cl\u00e9ment Pelletier, and part of her mission was to arrange his escape from France so that he could join the Manhattan Project. This will become especially important in Tightrope, which is set primarily in the post-nuclear age and the onset of the Cold War.One of the reasons why I was disenchanted by Trapezeis that we have read so many other novels of that kind before (such as Charlotte Gray by Sebastian Faulks), and Mawer had little to add. While the adventure of Marian's training and subsequent exposure to life, love, and danger was quite exciting (Mawer can always tell a good story), she herself did not have the maturity to offer an interior life of much complexity, which to my mind is the essential distinction between an adventure story and a true novel. But that was the previous book.

I decided not to re-read but to move on to the sequel in this duo of novels about Marian Sutro, who in Trapeze (in other editions titled The Girl Who Fell from the Sky) was parachuted into occupied France. I remember having mixed feelings about the first book but this one completely captured my attention and imagination. In Tightrope, Marian is drawn back into the world of espionage at the beginning of the Cold War as America exploded the first H bomb. Some peace activists believed that only by allowing Russia and other nations to have this technology would the world be kept safe - the threat of mutual destruction. I was a teenager when these issues were coming to a head and I well remember the uncertainties, prejudices and fears of that time. This is a marvellous spy story - complex, clever and intriguing. It is also a great character study of Marian, beautiful and adventurous but profoundly damaged by her experiences of capture, torture and internment in the war. My only reservation about the book was that in the first part, I was confused by the narrative voice which sometimes was that of Sam, who as a boy worshipped Marian, and sometimes that of an omniscient author. Only when Sam enters the story in his own right does this clumsiness resolve itself.

It\u2019s a novel I recall fondly\u2014a magnificent story that tracks Marian\u2019s training and challenges working in espionage during the war.Bilingual [French mother and English father] and well-educated Marian Sutro worked in Special Operations for Britain in WWII. After her release she returns to her parents\u2019 home in Great Britain and begins to forge a post-war existence for herself. As many returning from a war, she finds herself distant from her family and unsure about her place in the world. She wants independence but isn\u2019t sure about her identity at times. Is she a war hero\u2014she has the awards to prove it\u2014or is she just another woman chasing contentment? She finds work for a peace-keeping organization. While I adored Trapeze it came out three years ago and I don't remember minute details so I\u2019m not sure how this can qualify. Is it a sequel? The novel stands alone so I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d call it that. However, it\u2019s the second novel about the same character so by definition, it\u2019s a sequel. When I tweeted about this I got a response from the author himself so it should be considered sequel. I got slightly confused by the narrator at times, a man who knew Marian when she was a teenager. He\u2019d always had a crush on her. I\u2019m not sure why the novel needed this narrator. At one point I forgot who he was and had to turn back to the novel\u2019s beginning for a reminder. But then I decided I\u2019d not let it bother me and just appreciate Marian Sutro and this novel. Mawer writes exquisitely and Tightrope draws you in to Marian\u2019s life, the consequences of her actions during WWII and how she copes in the present. Why is Marian Sutro a superb literary character worth revisiting? Mawer writes: \u201cTry to see yourself as this lot see you. A stunning woman, dressed like a film star, who has done things no one here would dream of. Parachuted into occupied territory, lived a secret life, been captured and I don\u2019t know, tortured probably.\u201d She's an independent spirit. She's a feminist. She has lavish style and intensity. You want to be her or be friends with her. She exudes a magnetic charm and fierceness. Her military experience forces her into a gray zone. Whose side is she on? She was a spy and POW in WWII. She has sex with whomever she wants. She married a man who intensely pursued her. Not particularly for love but perhaps for companionship. It doesn\u2019t keep her from affairs with other men during her travels. On the cover, Marian looks like she\u2019s in a Tamara de Lempicka painting. She\u2019d be an ideal subject for the bold artist. Mawer includes cold war fears, atomic bombs, a gay scientist (Marian\u2019s brother) as well as Marian\u2019s love affair with a Russian Jew. On this relationship, Mawer writes: \u201cIn Absolon\u2019s presence she no longer thought of Benoit, or Clement, or Veronique or Alan. They all seemed irrelevant. And she no longer contemplated death and betrayal but speculated instead on the possibility of staying with this man, Absolon, for the rest of her life, in Canada maybe, under an assumed name. Absurd, of course, but she had these thoughts.\u201d Marian\u2019s brother is one of the scientists working on weapons and, more importantly, bombs. He\u2019s gay during a particularly dangerous time to be gay in England. Marian scoffs at his choice of lover: \u201cHer brother queer, the lover of some skinny, common youth.\u201dPlenty of elements keep you intrigued. It\u2019s not the confusing John Le Carre-type espionage plot which I could never follow. This novel remains character-driven with lovely descriptive passages and a riveting narrative."}, {"userName": "Barb", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/849475-barb", "userReview": "First let me caution you not to read too many reviews out there for this book. In my opinion they give too much of the story away. At the same time I want to encourage you to read Simon Mawer's first book about Marian Sutro, 'Trapeze' (also published as 'The Girl Who Fell From the Sky') where we learn all the backstory behind 'Tightrope'. While 'Tightrope' can be read as a stand alone the experience will be much richer and more rewarding if you read the two in chronological order, too many eventualities will be revealed if you read this one first.I read 'Trapeze' in September, it had been on my list to be read for a while and originally picked up the print version of the book but early on switched to the audio version and really enjoyed the reader. I love that audio books come to life for me in a way that print books don't. It's as if the real Marian Sutro was telling me her story.Here her story is narrated by family friend, Samuel Wareham who travels to Switzerland to interview Marian decades after the exciting events in her life post war are over. Now an old woman in her eighties he's there to fill in the details of certain events so 'the agency' can close her file. She was a family friend of his mother and he was in awe of her as a child. Through this interview Marian remembers the difficulty of adjusting to ordinary life after the war was over and how she coped with her ennui.An excellent conclusion to the story of Marian Sutro's fascinating life."}, {"userName": "KerryH", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24879948-kerryh", "userReview": "This was an excellent holiday read, Marian Sutro is a wonderful character and Simon Mawer writes beautiful, elegant prose. This book is a sequel to The Girl who Fell from the Sky where we are introduced to Marian as she prepares to join the SOE and be parachuted into Occupied France during WWII, and it takes up her story following her release from Ravensbruck concentration camp. Marian was interned following her capture, interrogation and torture by the Gestapo. This book is more interesting because it delves into what we now diagnose as PTSD and the struggle that she faces to lead a 'normal' life in postwar Britain. Others have criticised the character's willingness to have affairs with various other characters in the novel but I feel that this is just another manifestation of her survivor's guilt and PTSD. I believe that Marian has lost her sense of self through her wartime experiences, and finds it very difficult to form close relationships has it has been demonstrated to her time and again, that they don't last, though often through no fault of her own but circumstance. This isn't the first time I have wondered why it was that the SOE chose such young women for its agents, perhaps because they foolishly believed that, because of their youth and attractiveness, they would not become suspects? I feel it would have been better to choose maturer women with far more life experience."}, {"userName": "Bernadette Robinson", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14964934-bernadette-robinson", "userReview": "My thanks to the Publishers and NetGalley for the opportunity to read this in exchange for an honest review. gave this 5 stars or 10/10.When I chose this story on NetGalley I didn't realise that it was the second in a series about a character known as Marian Sutro. The frst in the series is called The Girl Who Fell from the Sky, I found that not having read it in no way impaired my enjoyment or understanding of this one.It's a while since I finished this one now, but I really enjoyed it at the time. The story reminded me in some ways of a film set around WWII called Odette which was based on the life of Odette Sansom a WWII spy.Tightrope continues on the story of Marian Sutro as WWII is drawing to a close and Marian is trying to settle back into some normality, however she is soon drawn back into a life of espionage in the Cold War era that followed. Told as a dual time frame story from the perspective that Marian is reminiscing about her past to a family friend.Well written this story drew me in and took me on a journey with Marian as she got mixed up in a life of discovery as she found herself embroiled in the life of a spy once again.

Marian Sutro was a covert agent who was parachuted into France to work with the resistance and to ensure that a scientist was returned to England to help work on what was to become the atomic bomb. Instead of returning with him Marian remains in France and is picked up by the Gestapo, tortured for information, and then sent to Ravensbruck concentration camp. She manages to survive the ordeal and escapes from the camp and eventually returns to her Oxford home.Her exploits are rewarded with medals and she is lauded as a heroine but finds it difficult to settle into a \"normal\" life. She is lured back into the clandestine world of espionage, while developing a personal discomfort with the fact that the Americans are the only ones with the ability to threaten the new order with the Bomb. She marries but also enters relationships forged through he spy networks. The Cold War is often a landscape for good thriller writing and this is no exception. Simon Mawer tells Maria Sutro's story through the eyes of a younger acquaintance who is in awe of her.

It is Marian Sutro, whose existence was last known to her British controllers in autumn 1943 in Paris. One of a handful of surviving agents of the Special Operations Executive, she has withstood arrest, interrogation, incarceration, and the horrors of Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp, but at what cost? Returned to an England she barely knows and a postwar world she doesn\u2019t understand, Marian searches for something on which to ground the rest of her life. Family and friends surround her, but she is haunted by her experiences and by the guilt of knowing that her contribution to the war effort helped lead to the monstrosities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. When the mysterious Major Fawley, the man who hijacked her wartime mission to Paris, emerges from the shadows to draw her into the ambiguities and uncertainties of the Cold War, she sees a way to make amends for the past and at the same time to find the identity that has never been hers.\u00a0A novel of divided loyalties and mixed motives, Tightrope is the complex and enigmatic story of a woman whose search for personal identity and fulfillment leads her to shocking choices.", "title": "Tightrope\n      \n          (Marian Sutro #2)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25505661-tightrope", "average": 3.74, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1431102629l/25505661.jpg", "reviews": 209, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/56836.Simon_Mawer", "name": "Simon Mawer"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fiction", "Spy Thriller", "Thriller", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25505661-tightrope", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25387714-tightrope", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28462312-tightrope", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25380711-tightrope", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25873940-tightrope", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26803317-provazochodkyn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31236026-tightrope", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24869802-tightrope", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2694539-the-glass-room", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13000865-trapeze", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/479669.The_Fall", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/98781.Mendel_s_Dwarf", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/104284.The_Gospel_of_Judas"]}
