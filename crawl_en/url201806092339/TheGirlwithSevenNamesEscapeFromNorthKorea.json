However, I found this book intriguing, unique and inspiring. What Hyeonseo offers in this book is quite different from other N.Korean defector's story. She's from a family with high class, had a relatively comfortable life to North Korean standard, and did not leave her country and family with the intention of never going back and in search for freedom. It is the realities of the ruthless, harsh regime that twists her path back to her country and she is thrown into a new universe where she had to make her own way. With more candor than emotion, she tells how she found the new world with freedom was also a world full of challenges and hardships, and how she navigated them to find her way through and found her identity as herself. This book is also unique in a way it tells N. Koreans life in free countries can be challenging and not as rosy as many may simply imagine. How profound the propaganda is engraved in people's mind and perspectives, now the capitalistic life can be menacing, and how the sudden exposure to this unknown terrain could be as dangerous as to most defectors. All important topics and questions that deserve more attention among people in South Korea as host nations and be discussed to find better answers. All in all, I think this book is a must read. Whether you want to 1)learn about the world's most ruthless dictatorship regime and how it systematically abuse its power for the benefits of the few and most people suffer not knowing life could be different elsewhere, 2) like to be inspired by a young woman who had the strength to navigate through series of life-changing, often life-threatening challenges, preserve the belief in herself and love for family, reunite with her family and herself in the end. Believe it or not, you will find both when you finish this book."}, {"userName": "abby", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44478099-abby", "userReview": "By the time she turned 29, Hyeonseo Lee had spent a decade living on the run and in hiding. She had escaped a brothel, survived a kidnapping, run away from a loveless engagement, and changed her name four times. She was attacked on the street, robbed, conned, and arrested more than once.She is one of the lucky ones.Hyeonseo Lee was born in North Korea under a different name, to a family with good songbun (NK's caste system). But even being one of the lucky ones in North Korea means that Lee witnessed her first public execution at seven years old. Like all citizens, starting in elementary school, she was forced to partake in weekly tattletale sessions, where one has to confess to a \"crime\" or accuse someone else of one. It could be as simple (and deadly serious) as \"I don't think about the Dear Leader enough times during the day.\" While her family had food, in part because of her industrious and savvy mother, she witnessed others starving to death during the 1990s famine that killed hundreds of thousands.Even under these conditions, when Lee escapes, it's purely a matter of curiosity. Her family lives in a town directly across from China, along the narrowest part of the river that separates the two countries. She plans to turn around and come right back, but things don't work out that way.But it's not freedom that necessarily waits for her beyond the border. The Chinese government is dogged about tracking down illegal North Koreans and returning them to their fate back home. In many ways, Lee's life in China is as arduous as her life in North Korea. South Korea gives citizenship for all NK asylum seekers, but getting there isn't easy. Lee finally makes it and without suffering abuse in a Laotian prison like so many others-- women, particularly-- desperately trying to get to Seoul.Yup, Hyeonseo Lee is one of the \"lucky ones.\" And I've never felt so damn privileged in my life.I really enjoyed this book. At times, Lee's storytelling is a little flat, and her decision to end each chapter with a cliff-hanger (that gets resolved on the very next page) is a little odd. This is a great book for anyone looking to learn about North Korea or just read an interesting memoir. 4.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Dem", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2752994-dem", "userReview": "What an interesting story and its so hard to believe that in this day and age that a whole nation of 25.5 Million people could be so cut off from the rest of the world and its leader could controll and dictate everything about peoples lives from birth to death.I had read a couple of books on North Korea over the years and came across The Girl with Seven Names: A North Korean Defector\u2019s Story and another book which I felt were both worth reading.This book is easy to read and Hyeonseo Lee is certainly a lady with a lot of courage and if you enjoy reading about different culture and traditions then this is interesting and a great insight into one young woman's struggle to gain freedom. I watched a couple of you tube clips of this lady giving talks and she certainly is an inspiring and interesting woman and her book is an excellent insight into life under one of the world's most ruthless and secretive dictatorships.There were times in the story where I struggled with the authors choices and found myself wondering why she made some of the crazy choices she did and yet the more I though about it the more I realised she wasn't brought up as I was where making choices is something I take for granted, in her world life is dictated to you and you dont get to crave your own path in life so therefore choices and decisions must be very difficult to make when its never been part of your life.Each chapter ends in a sort of cliff hanger which I found a little bit pointless as the book didn't need to be written in this format as the story is so compelling in itself but its only a small thing and doesnt take a way from the book.The one thing this book really brought to light is just how confusing and challenging life in the free world can be for those who make the journey and the guilt and worry over family left behind.An easy and insightful read and I think this would make a wonderful bookclub read for those looking for something a little different."}, {"userName": "Camie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7399266-camie", "userReview": "If you're like me and haven't read much about past and present living conditions in Northern Korea , you'll learn a lot here.This simply written book follows the courageous journey of a 17 year old girl who will need to change her name seven times after she defects from North Korea and reinvents her life both in China and later South Korea.

For example she stayed with relatives in China for 2 whole years (!!!) and didn't think of maybe using that time to get a job to save money, or to learn a vocation? Then she runs away penniless on the spur of the moment and has no plan of what to do. You had 2 years to think about it and relied on the kindness of distant relatives to support you, but you didn't think ahead of what to do next??She seemed really naive in general, especially when she constantly turned to brokers for help, even though she clearly says again and again she didn't trust them. She was incredibly lucky and fortunate to have people around her who had a lot of money to constantly bail her out and those connections clearly helped her.Also the fact that she didn't even know at first that people were starving in the 90s in N. Korea and she was eating meat daily, makes it clear that she lived a very insulated life there, and probably had a very different experience from the average N. Korean. I'd really love to know her mother's story, because to be honest, she sounds like a much tougher cookie than her daughter, cleverly supporting her 2 children and getting them through famine as a single mother. Wow, hats off to her!I did enjoy this book because I'm fascinated with any books from N. Korean defectors in general, but my sympathies with her were limited. I'm glad she got out, and that she was able to help her family as well, but this is probably not the experience of most N. Korean defectors. I do wish her all the best and hope more people learn about what is going on in N. Korea."}, {"userName": "Sharon Metcalf", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49089020-sharon-metcalf", "userReview": "The Girl with Seven Names: Escape From North Korea by Hyeonseo Lee is what reading is all about for me. Learning something of the world, of the lives of others and gaining an appreciation for just how fortunate I am to have been born in this time and place with the freedoms and luxuries often taken for granted. Hyonseo Lee's memoir tells of the complete ideological indoctrination of the North Korean people. She detailed the way the brainwashing begins from the time of their birth and never lets up, the violence and fear of repercussions for the people, and the importance of restricting outside information describing it this way: \"...in truth there is no dividing line between cruel leaders and oppressed citizens. The Kims rule by making everyone complicit in a brutal system, implicating all, from the highest to the lowest, blurring morals so that no one is blameless........Ordinary people are made persecutors, denouncers, thieves. They use the fear flowing from the top to win some advantage, or to survive.\" At the age of 17 Hyeonseo escaped North Korea but her battle did not end there. It was not until she finally managed the defect to South Korea almost ten years later than she was able to experience anything remotely like freedom, and even then she was not willing to relax until she had also assisted her mother and brother to freedom. Theirs was a completely foreign world to mine and I cannot begin to imagine experiencing all they endured. Time and again Hyeonseo Lee and her family put their lives at risk, were at the mercy of con men, brokers, corrupt police and other officials expecting to be bribed whether to turn a blind eye or to ease their paths to freedom. I am often bewildered about why the people of places like North Korea remain loyal to tyrannical governments and Hyonseo explained it this way \"North Koreans who have never left don't think critically because they have no point of comparison - with previous governments, different policies, or with other societies in the outside world.\"I can only admire this young lady who has not only written this book but who also testified at the first United Nations Commission of Enquiry on human rights in North Korea, and was invited to do a TED talk.

Ultimately, now I can say that the difference between the two books is mostly in the way they view the subject. Hyeonseo Lee tells her own experiences, the life as she knew it, the world as she was taught to view it. However, Barbara Demick's book is more of a collection of stories, told through the prism of someone who knows the political situation well and could define the difference between what the defectors were experiencing, and what they knew about the world, versus what was actually happening. While this is mentioned in Lee's narrative, she talks about it more in retrospect, as when certain political and historical situations were unfolding, she was oblivious to the facts, having been indoctrinated in the North Korean values.For me,\u00a0The Girl with Seven Names was a very valuable and interesting look into North Korea, and especially the way the people there view the world. But more so, as Hyeonseo Lee says so herself, she was not even from the lower classes of society, so she had it better than the rest. And \"better\" was not starving to death, not being sold as a bride in China, not being invited to serve and please the \"leader\".I think it's really hard for any of us, even those, like me, who have lived in a communist, or post-communist country, to imagine the level of poverty, corruption and censure that people experience in a country like North Korea. I've witnessed firsthand only one somewhat similar country, that I'd rather not name, and it saddened me deeply how much people need to put up with to gain even their basic human rights, how much bribery is needed to not be falsely accused of a crime you didn't commit, or how little you have, and yet learn to live with. That is not to say that I'm not seeing remains of this to this day in my own country. There was one particular sentence in The Girl with Seven Names, which reminded me of how Bulgarians can be, and which is something that I've heard even from foreigners who otherwise like or even love Bulgaria and the Bulgarian people:\n\"North Koreans have a gift for negativity towards others, the effect of a lifetime of compulsory criticism sessions.\"\nWhile to my knowledge, people haven't had those criticism sessions here, I feel like pessimism and negativity are only two of many things that get born from regimes like the one in North Korea. So in many ways, the book was both very alien and unimaginable, but also very familiar, and close to home.The fact which saddened my while reading both The Girl with Seven Names, and Nothing to Envy, is how North Koreans are treated while trying to defect. I would understand the unnecessary repercussions if North Koreans were not wanted in South Korea. But knowing that South Korea welcomes them, for all the countries around to stop the defectors, imprison them, or return them to North Korea to be punished or even executed, seems the highest level of inhumane.While reading this book, I couldn't stop thinking how lucky Hyeonseo Lee was in comparison to other defectors. At the very least, she managed to get out, and save her family, and even become a spokesperson about the rights of North Koreans. But what about all of those who were detained, killed, or maybe even worse...?I think that books like this one are such which every person should read. Especially those who live happy little lives in a rich country in the West, and have no understanding of how the world works, or how bad some people have it. I'm sorry if it seems harsh, but the lack of empathy in some countries has reached levels which are so high that should be criminal. We're all people, so we shouldn't just accept that we deserve to have it better than others."}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21824889-nancy", "userReview": "4.5 stars. One of the better books I've read on North Korean defection. Kudos to the co-author who brilliantly translated Lee's emotional journey into a page-turner. The third part was my favorite because it involved her family's long and arduous journey to join her in South Korea. I wasn't surprised that both her mother and brother longed to return to the North because adapting to life in Seoul presented a tremendous and negative cultural shock. While it is impossible for me to imagine what daily life would be like in the North Korean regime, I can imagine that adapting to a polar opposite way of living in the day-to-day - full of unknowns and experiences so uncommon (such as using an ATM) - might make me wish to return to the the devil I knew. I gave this book 4.5 stars because I wanted to read more about the family's struggles adapting to life in Seoul.

Her escape story and life in China testifies to her grit and intelligence. And the story of how she adopted seven different names in her life, and what they all meant, is heartbreaking for those of us with more stable lives.

In her classroom and at her mother\u2019s job, weekly meetings were conducted in which everyone in attendance had to confess their guilt about something and accuse others of the same. The leaders of her country were made heroes in fairy tales told by her kindergarten teachers. Those who did not cry enough when Kim Il-Sung died mysteriously disappeared. Even living on the borderland between North Korea and China, where some Chinese channels could be picked up and hundreds of goods were smuggled into the country every day, the oppressive hand of the regime was constantly felt. When Lee is finally able to make a trip to the other side of the border at the age of 17, she tastes freedom, however skewed, for the first time, and she realizes she can never return home. This book was incredible. Lee\u2019s journey was both harrowing and inspirational. To get a glimpse into one of the most secretive and oppressive countries in the world was incredibly valuable, and the experiences Lee recounts after her escape are incredible. The Girl with Seven Names, titled for the different names Lee had to adopt to avoid deportation while making a new life for herself, tells a fantastic story with a unique perspective. When she made her escape at 17, Lee was just hoping to spend a couple days in China before coming back home, afraid that if she waited until she was 18, the punishment if she were caught would be a lot harsher. However, after she arrived on the other side, she was told that it was not safe for her to return to her country ever again. Suddenly, all Lee had in the world were the clothes on her back, and she had to learn how to survive in a country that would instantly deport her if they knew where she was from. Coming from that kind of a mindset, being a rebellious teenager who didn\u2019t have any motivation at the time to become a political refugee or human rights activist, created such an interesting perspective in this reading. Combined with the themes of survivalism and family duty, this book turned out to be quite a page turner. The Girl with Seven Names is one of the best books I\u2019ve read all year, and I wholeheartedly recommend it for people looking for a fresh new memoir to read, those who are interested in international affairs, or those to whom Korea holds a more personal interest."}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2154195-diane", "userReview": "What a fascinating look inside a place so shrouded in secrecy. I've watched a couple of documentaries about North Korea on Netflix, and was shocked by the extent of indoctrination and how isolated the North Korean people are from knowledge of the world beyond their borders. This is the story of a young girl who had it pretty good in North Korea, comparatively speaking [the ludicrousness of that statement is illustrated by the fate of her father], but was starting to have some doubts and questions about the awesomeness of her homeland, and the supposed benevolence of its rulers. In an act of teenage rebellion and impetuousness, she decided to sneak across the border to China for a quick look around. Little did she know that she'd be leaving her family behind for many years, that she'd be placing them in grave danger, and that she, as a 17 year old girl with no money, would have to figure out how to deal with the consequences of her impulsive act and make it on her own from there on out. The beginning of the book describes life inside North Korea, and it's almost impossible for someone born in a free country to imagine a life like this. The thing is, if you were born of a higher social caste, like the author's family, life wasn't all that bad so long as you played the game, watched your every word, and didn't mind living under the constant threat of arrest and public execution. This book reads like fiction. It's filled with twists and turns and kept me on the figurative edge of my seat. Things were not totally peachy just by virtue of escape across the border. Illegals in China get shipped back to North Korea all the time, and the threat of detection is ever-present. Nor is it simple for a young North Korean with no papers to make a living. Hence the decision to make it across the border to South Korea and to formally defect. The route to do that, and the challenges and risks involved, were many.I alternated between thinking the author was incredibly brave, crazy, lucky, or some combination of all. She's determined to see her family again, and she makes that happen. The story of how is gripping. We might like to think that a person trapped within the borders of North Korea would be ecstatic to escape to a land of greater opportunity, but the challenges, and adjustments, are huge. I was thrilled to see the pictures of Hyeonseo Lee and her family at the end, because they look happy. She's got a book that made the Goodreads list of top non-fiction books for 2015, so I just have to say, \"You go girl!\""}, {"userName": "Aida", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10960786-aida", "userReview": "In my years of working in a large, inner city school system, I've encountered several families that have migrated to the US from different parts of the world.

The central theme was due to poverty and wanting of a better life.

And this isn\u2019t even a novel, but a memoir! But then, a jaded reader like me can often sense where the plot of a novel will go, but in real life, anything can happen.Hyeonseo Lee was born in North Korea, and the first third of this book traces her parents\u2019 love story and her childhood in the world\u2019s most isolated country. It is not the misery memoir you might expect on reading \u201cNorth Korea\u201d: the author\u2019s family, while without political power, has a relatively high social status due to her grandparents\u2019 communist credentials, and her mother\u2019s black-market trading means they never go hungry. Much of Lee\u2019s childhood plays out in Hyesan, just across a shallow river from China, and at age 17 \u2013 for reasons best summarized as \u201cshe was 17\u201d \u2013 she decides to cross the river, just for a few days, to see life on the other side. This is the beginning of an epic journey for Lee and her mother and brother, through China, Laos and finally South Korea.I think of this book as an adventure story, even though the second 2/3 of the book span more than a decade, because it turns out there are few safe places for North Korean defectors. Lee spends years in China, where she could be deported home at any moment if her true identity is discovered (hence her use of several names). She ultimately learns that, compared to most defectors, her journey is relatively easy, but it seems harrowing to me \u2013 and the more so when, years later, she returns to bring her family out. This is a fast-paced book (especially after the first third), full of dialogue and immersion in its settings.But it also feels like a very honest book. I would expect a North Korean defector with an English-language publisher to feel pressure to sensationalize her story of life in North Korea and portray escape from that country as unmitigated triumph. But the author\u2019s and her family\u2019s experiences are much more complex. While there\u2019s plenty to dislike about North Korea, it\u2019s a world whose rules they understand. On leaving, they lose home and family, and their nerve-wracking journey leads them to a foreign country where they are considered second-class citizens, struggling to make ends meet with menial jobs, since a North Korean education is worthless in South Korea. By the end of the book, the reader can understand why they all, at different times, want to go back. Lee also writes honestly about her feelings of guilt: she makes some ill-considered decisions, and at times hurts other people; but with her limited choices and little support, it\u2019s hard to blame her. It isn\u2019t all hardship, though. The family\u2019s bonds are strong, and they forge ahead and find help in some unexpected places.This isn\u2019t a literary memoir and while the characters are well-defined, I don\u2019t find them especially memorable. Nevertheless, I had a wonderful time reading this book, blowing through most of it in one day, during which I was more or less glued to its pages.

The style itself is very matter-of-fact, and the writing isn't emotional. It doesn't have to be. The stories she tells are powerful enough on its own. Just when you think that Hyeonseo catches a break, something else terrible happens. But what really sets this book apart for me is the nuance - the fact that life is as difficult for a North Korean defector in China or South Korea as it is to remain in North Korea. For Hyeonseo, this is because she had a remarkably \"normal\" and happy childhood. The totalitarian regime infects every part of life, causing neighbors to inform on each other and kindergarteners to have to go through self-criticism sessions, and there is no concept of human rights. Even with all of that, though, what struck me is that Hyeonseo's family was actually reasonably well-off and happy. Not every North Korean experiences this privilege, of course, but it casts the struggles in China and South Korea in a very different light. Life was not automatically better for them when they defected. There are significant emotional scars from growing up in a place where every action could be considered suspect, and these are things that they will always struggle with."}, {"userName": "Caitlin Gutilla", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20200132-caitlin-gutilla", "userReview": "This is the most informative, interesting, and mind boggling memoir I've ever read.

Pretty much everyone in the modern day world knows North Korea is ruled by a tyrant who doesn't feed or take care of his people, so when they finally manage to escape, we're just going to ship them back? That's completely inhumane. I'm happy that Hyeonseo managed to escape North Korea. But it kills me knowing there is still a whole country full of people suffering from the Kims."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75157-carol", "userReview": "This book reads like fiction - it grabs you immediately and doesn't let go.

It's written so well - compelling without sensationalism or verbosity. The insight in the North Korean indoctrination of party loyalty above everything was fascinating.

I would like to ask the author if there isn\u2019t any writer\u2019s embellishment because this story is too astonishing to believe. You will find this defectors story of her life behind the iron curtain, her defection, and then the defection of her mother and brother, so interesting that you will not be able to put the book down. Also, this is important information in lieu of recent world events. Hyeonseo Lee\u2019s book serves as a lens into life inside what Lisa Ling of National Geographic called the Hermit Kingdom. People need to realize, that there is an elaborate caste system and people are treated according to their \u201csongbun.\u201d There are three basic levels and it is based on your family\u2019s loyalty during the Korean War. The highest songbun is \u201cLoyalist\u201d followed by \u201cWavering\u201d and finally \u201cHostile.\u201d There are said to be fifty-something sub-classifications and only the government knows for sure the official family classification. Only families of the highest songbun lived in Pyongyang. Later, MS Lee would explain it was easier for defectors of the lower songbuns to adjust to life in South Korea because they were so persecuted in the North. Hyesonseo\u2019s family were smugglers and had a pretty high songbun. They enjoyed a higher living standard than most North Koreans. Bribery and corruption were rampant but this was good for MS Lee\u2019s family because they could afford to pay the bribes and they benefited from that corruption. In school and at work, every Friday was a day of confession and accusation. Each citizen had to confess something and then accuse a classmate or a co-worker of something. This was initiated by the great leader in 1974. Most of the time people would secretly work out deals with each other to accuse and confess to something minor. \u201cI will tell on you this week and you tell on me next week.\u201d Sometimes, however, it could be a surprise and three generations of a family could disappear overnight to the gulag. Hyeonseo Lee\u2019s book and subsequent TED talk sheds light on the plight of the North Korean defector and how the Chinese government is complicit in arresting North Koreans and sending them back to certain doom. The desperation of the defector makes them vulnerable to an unscrupulous world of human traffickers, gangs of smugglers, brokers, and corrupt minor officials that will fleece the defector of every last penny and then send them back to North Korea anyway. Also, the North Korean secret police (Bowibu) are allowed to operate in China reminiscent of the Fugitive Slave Law in the antebellum United States. Hyeonseo\u2019s ordeal starts when she crosses the Yalu River to visit her father\u2019s relatives in China. She tells her cousin that her father was killed at the hands of the secret police. Her cousin becomes angry and informs MS Lee that her country is terrible and that she has been spoon fed lies all of her life. He sets that record straight about the great leader and tells her that 1.) The great leader did not lead a revolution to chase out the Japanese after WWII. The Russians invaded Korea and defeated the Japanese. 2.) The great leader led an invasion of the South, unprovoked, and started the Korean War and not the other way around. 3.) It was the Chinese and not the Great Leader that pushed the Americans to below the 38th parallel. 4.) He wasn\u2019t born in a log cabin and he is not starving like the rest of his people. \"He's not even a Communist.\" As evil as the North Korean government was/is Hyeonseo could not accept this. She stayed in China for a long time because South Korea was the archenemy. Later, her mother and brother had trouble accepting her American fianc\u00e9 because he was an American. It is hard to reprogram yourself to trust people and open up.Hyeonseo Lee summed up her book with the following statement:One of the main reasons that distinctions between oppressor and victim are blurred in North Korea is that no one there has any concept of rights. To know that your rights are being abused, or that you are abusing someone else\u2019s, you first have to know that you have them, and what they are. But with no comparative information about societies elsewhere in the world, such awareness in North Korea cannot exist. This is also why most people escape because they\u2019re hungry or in trouble \u2013 not because they\u2019re craving liberty. Many defectors hiding in China even baulk at the idea of going to South Korea \u2013 they\u2019d see it as a betrayal of their country and the legacy of the Great Leader. If the North Korean people acquired an awareness of their rights, of individual freedoms and democracy, the game would be up for the regime in Pyongyang. The people would realize that full human rights are exercised and enjoyed by one person only \u2013 the ruling Kim. He is the only figure in North Korea who exercises freedom of thought, freedom of speech, freedom of movement, his right not to be tortured, imprisoned, or executed without trial, and his right to proper healthcare and food.

Although her privileged family background insulated her from the cruelest horrors of the regime, living near the border with China gave her some exposure to the world beyond the confines of the Hermit Kingdom. When the famine of the 1990s struck, she began to wonder, question and to realise that she had been brainwashed her entire life. Given the repression, poverty and starvation she witnessed surely her country could not be, as she had been told, \u201cthe best on the planet\u201d?Aged seventeen, she decided to escape North Korea. She could not have imagined that it would be twelve years before she was reunited with her family. Rumours of her escape were spreading, and she and her family could incur the punishments of the government authorities\u2014involving imprisonment, torture, and possible public execution\u2014if she returned. Hyeonseo instead remained in China and rapidly learned Chinese in an effort to adapt and survive. This is the unique story not only of Hyeonseo\u2019s escape from the darkness into the light, but also of her coming of age, education and the resolve she found to rebuild her life\u2014not once, but twice\u2014first in China, then in South Korea. Twelve years and two lifetimes later, she would return to the North Korean border in a daring mission to bring her mother and brother to South Korea, risking her own life in the process. Against the odds, she and her family survived one of the most arduous, costly and dangerous journeys imaginable. Strong, brave and eloquent, this memoir is a triumph of her remarkable spirit.", "title": "The Girl with Seven Names: Escape From North Korea", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22934314-the-girl-with-seven-names", "average": 4.45, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1460908564l/22934314.jpg", "reviews": 2306, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7785294.Hyeonseo_Lee", "name": "Hyeonseo Lee"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/449304.David_John", "name": "David John"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Autobiography", "Biography"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22934314-the-girl-with-seven-names", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25362017-the-girl-with-seven-names", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25822881-the-girl-with-seven-names", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35248097-the-girl-with-seven-names", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25897085-schwarze-magnolie", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20873678-the-girl-in-the-red-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
