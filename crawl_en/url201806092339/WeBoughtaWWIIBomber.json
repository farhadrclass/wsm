Sandra did a great deal of research. The amount of details in this book for adults and teens is reflected in the extensive bibliography. 2. Today's teenagers are different than the patriotic, self-sacrificing teenagers who lived seventy years ago. Those students learned how to live with shortages of food, how to collect materials that could be re-purposed for the war effort, and willingly participated in scrap metal drives and rationing. Would we see that type of commitment and patriotism today?3. I knew that Kate and Lillie, the protagonists in my book, Half-Truths, would have been in elementary school during World War II. Reading this book made the time period come alive for me and helped me think more deeply about how those shortages affected them.WE BOUGHT A WWII BOMBER is the story of a dedicated group of junior and senior high students who raised more than $375,000 by selling War Bonds and War Stamps to purchase a B-17 bomber. The story begun in 1942 by a quiet student, Arthur Blackport, when he suggested that his fellow students at South High School in Grand Rapids, Michigan work together to purchase a Flying Fortress. Not only did the students raise enough money to purchase the bomber, but they also successfully raised money to buy an advanced trainer plane,as well as two disaster vehicles (which were a combination canteen, ambulance, and hospital car), and sixty-three fully equipped landing barges. After the bomber was officially christened and flown off, the students wondered what happened to it. \"How many battles had it won? How many German or Japanese planes had it destroyed?\" (p. 49)For seventy years no one knew what happened to the plane. The students heard rumors, but no facts. But in 2012, at her Class of 1962 fiftieth South High reunion, a remark which Sandra Warren made about \"Searching for the Spirit\" prompted a fellow classmate, Joe Rogers, to start digging for the truth. Joe uncovered the fate of \"The Spirit of South High\" which enabled Sandra to write this story. Sandra's attention to detail made this period come alive for me and I hope the book will inspire you. I am happy to give away my autographed copy of WE BOUGHT A WWII BOMBER. Please leave me a comment by 6 PM on Thursday, January 21 and your email address if you are new to this blog. PLUS--if you are in or near Central Florida, Sandra is speaking at the World War II study club on January 29 at the Colony Recreation Center in The Villages from 1-3 PM. Come on by and meet the author!"}], "description": "During WWII, to help fund the war effort, junior high and senior high students at South High School in Grand Rapids, Michigan took part in the \u201cBuy a Bomber\u201d program raising over $375,000 selling War Bonds and Defense Loan Stamps and bought a B-17 Bomber. They christened the bomber, \"The Spirit of South High,\" after which it flew off never to be heard from again, until now. Read the extraordinary tale of how students were able to raise so much money and the incredible \u201cspirit\u201d that led alumni, seventy-two years later, to solve the mystery of what happened to the bomber?
