Shaara builds on the first novel's focus on the Battle of Shiloh by turning things towards Mississippi and the vital city of Vicksburg, approximately a year after the aforementioned skirmish. Located on a key route (the Mississippi River) that serves the Confederate Army, General Pemberton seeks to protect this gem while awaiting more troops and instruction from superior. However, fresh from victory in Shiloh, Union Generals Grant and Sherman seek to push forward and overtake the region, thereby paralysing the Confederates in an attempt to stave off any momentum that might be tanking place further East. Shaara builds momentum up as all generals plot military manoeuvres surrounding the Siege of Vicksburg, which can only end with one army standing. A Confederate loss could commence a devastating domino effect that will reverberate across the South and bring Lincoln the impetus he needs to justify this war to the world. While Shaara offers wonderful troop and general perspectives in the narratives, he introduces a new voice to the war, that of the citizenry. Lucy Spence is a young woman from Vicksburg who has seen her city turned into a chaotic mess, filled both with grey-uniformed Confederates with the Union's blue-uniformed troops filling the horizon. While she has been led to support the views of her southern brethren, Spence is enlisted as a civilian nurse and witnesses the horrors of war from the perspective of blood and gore, which differs greatly from the opening chapter, when things were still formal dinners and balls with the local soldiers. Spence sees war through the eyes of the civilians caught in the middle of fighting, but who suffer more, as the face a war of hunger and depravation, food becoming a commodity that only the Union can offer, which is stronger propaganda than any leaflet. Spence and other citizens of Vicksburg learn that their heroes who had been touting freedom from Washington's grasp and the right to hold slaves cannot be trusted if they cannot keep their own people from starving during the campaign. It is this weaponless war that might turn the tides more than any cannon or musket. When the smoke clears, Vicksburg falls and Grant can forge onwards, seeking to curry additional favour with Washington as the Confederate Army is left to nurse their substantial wounds. A powerful second volume in Shaara's latest Civil War series, sure to stir up significant emotions in the attentive reader.I am a long-time fan of Shaara and his writing style that explore war from perspectives untapped by academics or many historical fiction writers. While I struggled immensely with finding a connection in the first novel, being somewhat more conscientious of what is going on has allowed me to pull more (still not all) from the narrative in this second piece. In reading this collection, I am reminded of the John Jakes trilogy, North and South. Perhaps my bias and memory will sway me as I say this, but Shaara appears to be taking a page from the Jakes book and not only writing from the perspective of a fictional soldier, but now choosing an outsider to speak about the civilian interpretation of war. While Shaara usually chooses to keep the war and battlefields as his settings for all characters, use of a civilian is very Jakesian and does add additional flavour to the story. He does postulate that many civilians were outside the sphere of the War and knew little more than which side they were supposed to support. Key choices or decisions did not impact their choice of sides in the entire affair. As he usually does, Shaara offers a veiled (though it is apparent throughout) commentary on the struggles of war for those on the battlefield as well, be it tactics, marching, or the horrific food on offer. Shaara brings the reader inside and behind the lines to exacerbate the negative side of fighting, while still injecting pride into the act. Strong and regionally-peppered dialogues allow the reader to feel in the midst of the action in both camps, while also learning of their individual struggles as soldiers try to put themselves in the boots of the other. Chapters chock-full of detail, development, and historical portrayals of the settings allow the reader to envelop themselves in all that Shaara has to offer. Dense in spots, Shaara does not water things down, which will require a dedicated and attentive effort. There is not enough praise that can be offered up for this wonderful style of writing, geared towards a target audience.Kudos, Mr. Shaara for another wonderful novel. I am still trying to wrap my head around all that you have to present, but by pacing myself and paying particular attention, I have a much better idea of what happened in the lesser-known Western Theatre of America's Civil War.Like/hate the review?

A Chain of Thunder takes us through the build-up and conclusion of the Siege of Vicksburg, one of the most important victories for the Union forces. Unfortunately, the simultaneous victory at Gettysburg overshadows it. With this novel, Shaara hopes to change that.We follow Grant, Sherman, and Bauer--all characters from A Blaze of Glory--for the Union, and Pemberton and Lucy Spence for the Confederates. Unlike his previous Civil War novels, Shaara has taken a practice he developed in his WWI and WWII novels and given us the perspective of the front line fighter. And for the first time in any of his novels, he includes a civilian as one of his primary characters. Lucy Spence is one of the many citizens of Vicksburg, and her experiences are gripping and powerful.Fans of military fiction should read this, for we learn of Grant's brilliant campaign in Mississippi. Students of the Civil War should read this to better understand that there was more to the war that what happened in the east. Fans of good fiction should read it for its gripping story. That's what Shaara focuses on. Though he writes true history, his purpose is to draw out the human drama.Highly recommended.P.S. I was able to interview Jeff Shaara on behalf of the Historical Novel Society. Here it is: http://historicalnovelsociety.org/jef..."}, {"userName": "happy", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9369133-happy", "userReview": "This is another excellent look at the Civil War by Mr. Shaara. He uses his tried and true template to tell the story of the Siege of Vicksburg. As in his previous novel in the series, A Blaze of Glory, the Union story is told through the eyes of Gens Grant and Sherman as well as Pvt Bauer. The confederate side is told through the commander at Vicksburg, Gen Pemberton as well as civilian volunteer nurse Lucy Spence.A great percentage of the first half of the book is told from Gen Pemberton\u2019s view point and he does not come off well. He is a Pennsylvanian by birth and is constantly worried about the loyalty of his subordinate commanders to him. He is also worries about his duty to his superior officer Gen Johnston or President Davis who give him conflicting orders, Johnston to abandon Vicksburg and Davis to defend it to the end. In my opinion Pemberton comes off as a very poor leader and commander. In the character of Lucy Spence \u2013 a 19 yr old orphan, Shaara brings the civilian point of view to the story. In the character of Miss Spence, Shaara is able to look at how the Siege affected those caught in its vice. She is taken in by her neighbors originally helping tend their children and eventually volunteering as a nurse in one of the military hospitals. In this plot line Shaara looks both at the state of military medicine and how woman esp single women where expected to act and were treated in the South. In telling the Union side of the story, Shaara looks at some of the politics of the Union HQ. Grant fears that Charles Dana is a spy sent by Washington to undermine him, while Sherman continues his hatred of reporters. The sequences with Pvt Bauer are nicely done.Since this is mainly the story of a siege, the battle sequences are not a vivid as his previous books, thou the Battle of Champion Hill is nicely done and well as the assaults on the Confederate lines on May 19th and 22nd. As the battle settles into a siege, the story of the war between the snipers is also well done.Once again Mr. Shaara has brought the Civil War to life. This is a well researched and well told story. I highly recommend this novel."}, {"userName": "Zohar - ManOfLaBook.com", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3780991-zohar---manoflabook-com", "userReview": "A Chain of Thunder (Civil War: 1861-1865, Western Theater #2) by Jeff Shaara is a historical fiction book from this bestselling author. I have read several of Mr. Shaara\u2019s books previously and was delighted to find this one in my local library even though I did not read the first book in the series.Confederate Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton took his army and retreated to Vicksburg fortifying it and getting ready to defend it.Union Major General Ulysses S. Grant, after finally crossing the Mississippi River pushing Pemberton\u2019s army into Vicksburg. The Union sustains many casualties during their attempts to enter the city and General Grant reluctantly lays siege to Vicksburg.A Chain of Thunder (Civil War: 1861-1865, Western Theater #2) by Jeff Shaara takes place in and around Vicksburg, Mississippi during the American Civil War. The first book, I understand, focuses on the Battle of Shiloh, which is referenced in A Chain of Thunder, however I did not feel I missed anything by not reading it first.As with other books by the author, every chapter is told from the point of view of a different character, most historical figures, but others not. The cast of characters is varied, from Generals Grant, Sherman, and Pemberton to simple soldiers and civilians.I enjoyed the dialog Mr. Shaara puts in the mouth of his characters, especially the local dialect and local flavors. The characters in the book are well written, both historical and fictionalized come to life, we learn about their struggles, their demons, and their success. The author describes very well what it is like to be under siege, and the ones trying to break the siege, the small communities within communities the form whenever a dark turn takes a whole population, whether citizens or soldiers, into a place they\u2019ll never thought they\u2019ll be.The research in this book, as with the author\u2019s other books, demands special recognition. While the book is condensed, almost like a history book, it is very readable and interesting. The Battle of Vicksburg is one that I knew very little about, so it was very interesting to learn more about the battle.For more reviews and bookish posts please visit: http://www.ManOfLaBook.com"}, {"userName": "Steven Peterson", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1677868-steven-peterson", "userReview": "Jeffrey Shaara has written a number of historical novels focusing on warfare--from the Revolutionary War through World War II. He adopts the approach that his father used so well in \"Killer Angels,\" an historical novel of the battle of Gettysburg. The methods? Select a number of historical characters, from generals to foot soldiers to civilians, to whomever brings a point of view to the story that reveals something about the battle.Here, the focus is the siege of Vicksburg. The characters? A young woman resident of Vicksburg, giving us a civilian's eye view of the harshness of the conflict on ordinary people. John Pemberton, commander of the Confederate forces at Vicksburg. Fritz Bauer, a Union foot soldier, who gives a soldier's eye view of the siege. Then, Generals Sherman and Grant. By adopting this method, as noted, we get a sense of the many facets of the battle. Lucy Spence's travails, including serving as a nurse in Confederate hospitals, gives a sense of the horrors of the operating room. Her interaction with civilians captures the dire straits facing ordinary citizens of Vicksburg. From Pemberton and Grant and Sherman, we get a larger view as to what is transpiring.The novel begins on April 16th, recording the movement of Union ships along the Mississippi as they passed under the guns of Vicksburg. This began Grant's remarkable lightning movements leading to the siege. The last entry is on July 6, 1863, as Bauer reflects on the end of the battle. His story began with the first novel from the West authored by Shaara--on the deadly fight at Shiloh. The Confederates, ironically, surrenders on July 4th, after the troops had run so low on food, ammunition, and so on that their doom was obvious.A nice addition to Shaara's oeuvre. Sometimes, the multi-viewpoint approach loses its power, but it works pretty well here."}, {"userName": "Randal White", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4147806-randal-white", "userReview": "Another excellent book by Jeff Shaara. He's at his best when writing about the Civil War. The struggle for Vicksburg was different than other battles, it was a siege. Shaara captures the frustrations of the siege, from the highest commanders all the way to the civilians trapped in the city. While some reviewers are taking issue with the pace and the minutia of this book, they are missing the point. Vicksburg wasn't Gettysburg or Shiloh with their fast moving action, it was a long drawn out chess match. Shaara describes it perfectly. I can't wait for the third book of the trilogy!"}, {"userName": "Don", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/930737-don", "userReview": "A good read on one of the most overlooked developments of the Civil War: The siege of Vicksburg... Oops, I gave it away!Anyway, Shaara's approach of bouncing back and forth among different perspectives makes this book work.The \"modern Bruce Catton\" is always good for a fine, well-researched story. It isn't Killer Angels compelling, but it's solid stuff and makes use of recent journal discoveries, etc. to give what is certainly an accurate depiction."}, {"userName": "David Kinchen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21334604-david-kinchen", "userReview": "One hundred fifty years ago this summer there were two major turning points in the two-year old Civil War: Gettysburg and Vicksburg. Gettysburg was fought from July 1-3, 1863 and the siege of Vicksburg ended on Independence Day, July 4, 1863, with the surrender of Confederate forces commanded by Lt. Gen. John C. Pemberton.Both battles were important, perhaps signaling what Winston Churchill called in reference to an event during World War II, \"the end of the beginning,\" but the defeat of Gen. Robert E. Lee by Major Gen. George G. Meade at Gettysburg, Penn. has long gotten more ink than the considerably longer siege of Vicksburg.  One thing I didn't know: John Clifford Pemberton (1814-1881) was a Yankee by birth, a Pennsylvanian married to a Southerner, who cast his fate with the Confederate army, the mirror image of native Virginian Gen. George H. Thomas, \"The Rock of Chickamauga\" who stayed loyal to the Union side. Pemberton graduated from West Point in 1837 and, like many of the Civil War generals, was a veteran of the Mexican War. Continuing the series that began with last year's \"A Blaze of Glory\", the story of Shiloh Jeff Shaara returns to chronicle another chapter in the war that killed or wounded more people than all the other wars fought by Americans, the Civil War. In \"A Chain of Thunder: A Novel of the Siege of Vicksburg\" the action shifts to Vicksburg, dubbed the \u201cGibraltar of the Confederacy\u201d because it controlled navigation on the Mississippi River, most of which was in Yankee hands.The defeat of the rebels at Vicksburg decided for all time the fate of Major Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, as well as that of Gen. William T. Sherman -- and all but sealed the fate of the rebel cause. In May 1863, after months of hard and bitter combat, Union troops under the command of Major General Ulysses S. Grant at long last successfully cross the Mississippi River. They force the remnants of Confederate Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton\u2019s army to retreat to Vicksburg, burning the bridges over the Big Black River in its path. In a preview of things to come the next year in Georgia, much of Jackson, Mississippi's capital, was torched. After sustaining heavy casualties in two failed assaults against the rebels, Union soldiers are losing confidence and morale is low. Grant reluctantly decides to lay siege to the city, trapping soldiers and civilians alike inside an iron ring of Federal entrenchments. Six weeks later, the starving and destitute Southerners finally surrender, yielding command of the Mississippi River to the Union forces on July 4\u2014Independence Day. As he did in \"A Blaze of Glory\" and previous books, Shaara masterfully weaves in the stories of civilians, like 19-year-old Lucy Spence of Vicksburg and her friends and young German-American Pvt. Fritz Bauer of Milwaukee, and his fellow soldiers, who were also in \"A Blaze of Glory.\" If you've read about the static trench warfare of World War I, much of the narrative of \"A Chain of Thunder\" will remind you of those grim accounts, with the dead stacked up on the battlefield, often for days at a time in the steamy Mississippi summer. The portrayal of the residents of Vicksburg burrowing into the hillsides to escape the shelling are unforgettable. On one side stand the emerging legend Grant, his irascible second Sherman, and the youthful \u201cgrunt\u201d Private Fritz Bauer from Milwaukee, Wis.; on the other, the Confederate commanders Pemberton and Joseph Johnston, as well as nineteen-year-old Lucy Spence, a civilian doing her best to survive in the besieged city. \"A Chain of Thunder\" is historical fiction with a sound basis in fact at its best. I recommend it without reservation."}, {"userName": "Bob", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6991670-bob", "userReview": "The first four days of July 1863 were a decisive turning point in the Civil War. Ending with the repulse of Pickett's charge on July 3, the Union won a decisive victory at Gettysburg. Lesser known, but equally decisive in the West, Grant received the surrender of Vicksburg on July 4, opening up the Mississippi as a Union waterway, severing the connection with the western states of the Confederacy.In this work of historical fiction, the second in his series on the Western Theater in the Civil War, Jeff Shaara chronicles the series of events leading up to this surrender. We learn of Sherman's futile attempt to attack up the Yazoo the previous December. Then Admiral Porter bravely moves Union transports and gunboats past the Vicksburg batteries to be followed by Grant's crossing the Mississippi south of Vicksburg and his movements between Vicksburg and Jackson, occupied by Johnston's troops.As Grant is on the move, we see the contrast between him and Pemberton, the Confederate general charged by President Davis with holding Vicksburg while ordered by Johnston to move against Grant before Grant takes Jackson. Grant is clearly his own man, despite being dogged by undersecretary Dana and newspaperman Cadwallader. Pemberton is not and only reluctantly moves part of his forces out of Vicksburg and in not enough time to relieve Johnston but in just enough time to lose several battles including that at Champion Hill to Grant, despite the heroic action of some of his generals, especially John Bowen at Champion Hill. Then, instead of taking the chance of joining forces with Johnston, he returns to Vicksburg in a valiant but impossible attempt to defend the city against much superior forces who can wait him out.The seige of Vicksburg occupies the second half of the book. It begins with two demonstrations of the folly of charges upon entrenched positions, strengthened by Pemberton's engineer, Lockett, something it would take military leaders another fifty years to fully grasp, only in the latter stages of World War I. Thereafter Grant and his generals extend their lines and settle in for a seige that lasts from mid-May until July 4.How do you tell the story of a two-month wait? Shaara does so by chronicling the role of sharp-shooters, of whom Fritz Bauer, who we met in A Blaze of Glory, is one. He details the effects of repeated artillery bombardments in terms of the destruction of the town, the sheltering of its people in caves, and the scores of shrapnel wounds suffered. This leads to an innovation in a Shaara novel, the introduction of a civilian character, Lucy Spence, a single woman who becomes a volunteer nurse, braving the horrors of a Civil War field hospital with its ghastly wounds, amputations, and dying men. And we see the most deadly result of siege warfare, the creeping starvation that reduces people to trapping rats and squirrels and leads to increasing desertions.The story concludes with the surrender, negotiated by General Bowen, himself a dying man from dysentery. His previous friendship with Grant and sterling battle record helped overcome both the hard edges of \"unconditional surrender\" Grant and the pride of Pemberton. Nine days later, he is dead.Shaara gives us a read that sustains our interest through the seige and helps us glimpse once again the nobility and futility that combine in the horrors of war. And for those who feel most of their knowledge of the Civil War is limited to the Eastern campaigns, this helps us understand the decisive role these Western battles played."}, {"userName": "Joyce", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1650596-joyce", "userReview": "Thanks to Jeff Shaara (and first to his father Michael) I know a lot more history than I ever learned in school. As does Bernard Cornwell, he provides well-researched accounts of major battles and theaters of operation. I love the way he balances his narrative here between the soldiers (both the brass and the common soldier) and the civilians to provide a full picture of the effects of war. Dramatic in tone this novel of the siege of Vicksburg--and control of the Mississippi River--provides a sense of first-hand experience. A you-are-there feel. And while it covers generals and other military men we've heard about, if not actually studied in history classes, his warts-and-all approach offers a full picture of the characters, involving us in their thoughts and actions. He also sets the battle in context--it occurred at the same time as the Battle of Gettysburg. A wonderfully involving way to discover history. I also like Paul Michael who has narrated Shaara's recent titles. He's not overly dramatic but he effectively conveys the thoughts and natures of the characters as he lays out the situation."}, {"userName": "Joe", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3543119-joe", "userReview": "By the time news of Grant's capture of Vicksburg, Mississippi reached the major cities of the east coast, the Union was basking in the victory of Gettysburg a few days earlier and Vicksburg became something of an afterthought in the popular mind. In the spring of 1863, Union forces had captured most of the Mississippi River waterway, except the area near Vicksburg. Following several stagnated attempts at capturing the city, Grant and his generals (including Sherman) settled in for a long siege that eventually starved the city and Confederate forces into surrender.As usual, Jeff Shaara alternates \"voices\" with each chapter alternating the viewpoints of several individuals from both sides. This is his second book of a planned trilogy chronicling the Civil War in \"the west\", and while Shaara never fails to impart the lesson that \nwar is hell\n, he certainly makes the story -- and the continued rise of Ulysses S.

He writes fiction, but it is also history. All the events are historical, but he writes it as a novel. That way you get conversations and thoughts of historical figures that are fiction, but based on historical records. I find this a great way to understand what happened - in this case, the siege of Vicksburg in 1863 - in a way to bring the reader in to the story. As in all his books, some of the people we get to know are famous, Grant and Sherman and Joseph Johnston, and others are privates, sergeants and civilians that are as interesting to meet as the generals. This books gives a detailed history of the siege in a very entertaining way.

Reenactments and memorial events have taken place across the north and south, and bookstores have seen a major influx of everything from battlefield picture books to shelf-busting quantities of biographies of Ulysses S. Grant, abolitionist John Brown and Abraham Lincoln. Fiction has seen its share of work as well, but none as anticipated as A CHAIN OF THUNDER by Jeff Shaara.It is April 1863, and Union General Ulysses S. Grant is eager to capture the \"Gibraltar of the Confederacy\" --- the key city of Vicksburg, Mississippi. Union forces already control the Mississippi River to the north and have seized New Orleans. Taking Vicksburg allows them complete and unmolested access to the river, securing the western theater and allowing for ease of movement for troops, munitions and food lines. It also cripples the Confederacy. The problem is taking the city. Grant has already been repulsed once before, and coupled with the debacle at Shiloh the year prior, there are those in Washington and in the field who are maneuvering to have him removed from command.William T. Sherman and James B. McPherson remain loyal and tenacious companions, but General McClernand has a penchant for stopping his marches to make speeches about the glorious successes of his men. Grant is growing weary of McClernand's vanity, as is Sherman. He believes that McClernand is working in concert with Charles Dana, the Assistant Secretary of War who has been sent to \"observe\" Grant's command. He also believes that Sylvanus Cadwallader, a newspaper reporter allowed in Grant's camp, is part of the plot to have Grant removed.As if the drama with these men were not enough, the contempt between Confederate Generals John Pemberton and Joe Johnston exceeds the Union squabbles. Pemberton is frustrated that Johnston has taken the majority of the cavalry and utilized them --- unnecessarily --- in Tennessee in support of Braxton Bragg. Meanwhile, Union cavalry led by Benjamin Grierson has been destroying rail lines and communications lines, and has evaded capture at every turn. Without cavalry, Pemberton is blind to the movements of Grant's forces. He believes that Grierson is a distraction, keeping forces focused on his meddlesome raids while Grant places Sherman and his other men in a position to strike at Vicksburg.Johnston thinks that the raids are nothing but a cavalry having a bit of fun and amounts to nothing substantial. He continually ignores Pemberton's requests for cavalry and troop supports at Vicksburg. Like much of the Confederate force in Mississippi, he does not trust Pemberton, who is a Pennsylvania man, a northerner, which makes him suspect.As the two men squabble back and forth in couriered messages, Grant marches on the capital city of Jackson. Johnston, who has a considerably smaller force, flees and allows it to fall into Union hands. Grant, however, cares not for Jackson, and his men begin the march on the prime target of Vicksburg. Pemberton, reluctantly following the command of Johnston, is marching toward Jackson and is overrun by the superior forces of Grant. Confident that his original plan to protect Vicksburg was correct, he makes a quick retreat, and his engineers begin a furious construction of defenses.Following two days of impatient frontal assaults, Grant understands that such a plan will not work. Against his true wishes, he lays out his plan to \"starve them out,\" and begins the great siege that will lead to the collapse of the Confederacy in the Western Theater.With A CHAIN OF THUNDER, Shaara once again walks a beautiful line between historian and storyteller. As always, he relies on actual diaries and letters of the principal players, lending a true authenticity to the individual voices. Of note, especially, are Lieutenant General John Pemberton and Vicksburg civilian Lucy Spence.Pemberton has long taken the blame for \"selling\" Vicksburg to the Union. Shaara was able to utilize Pemberton's long-lost memoir, which never saw publication until 1999, and his view is in stark contrast to the condemning and often cited memoir of his adversary, Joe Johnston. A CHAIN OF THUNDER shows Pemberton as a man loyal to his Confederate cause despite his northern upbringing, constantly troubled by the disrespect shown by his subordinates. Commands are ignored, his station is diminished, and coupled with his sometimes damaging inability to make a decision, his command is eroded up to and including the moment of surrender to Grant on July 4, 1863.Lucy Spence represents a whole new area for Shaara --- the non-combatant. While he always incorporates an everyman for readers to connect with on the battlefield (here it is Private Fritz \"Dutchie\" Bauer, carried over from A BLAZE OF GLORY), Lucy marks the first time he has utilized a character caught in the crossfire. Lucy is a 19-year-old resident of Vicksburg, an orphan who experiences the great horrors of war firsthand. Living in caves with a neighbor in order to avoid the bombardment by the Union gunboats, Lucy undertakes to do her part and steps in as a nurse, seeing for herself the gruesome cost of war. Through her, readers experience the increased hardships of the general population of a city under siege, and see her go from an immature and innocent girl who longs for a Louisiana Lieutenant after a dance at a ball, to a young woman shaken by inhumanity. Her ultimate reconnection with that Lieutenant is poignant.Shaara, quite simply, never fails to deliver a powerful and engrossing tale. The history is real without the dryness of simple nonfiction telling. Opening A CHAIN OF THUNDER is to step into the spring and summer of 1863, and to experience the war in the heat and the sweat and the blood. The writing is picturesque and vibrant, and you can see Grant and Sherman standing together in the rain, chewing unlit cigars as they fume over their failures.The book hits shelves at the perfect time, for the events of the Siege of Vicksburg are now being commemorated as they reach their 150th year exactly as the book is placed on store shelves. On another note, Shaara has also decided that this current Civil War trilogy is to be expanded to four books. The more the merrier.In 1986, the US Army Field Manual on Operations lauded Grant's siege of Vicksburg as \"the most brilliant campaign ever fought on American soil.\" This brilliant and valuable victory was overlooked on July 4, 1863, for off in a little town known as Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, Robert E.

Michael Shaara , who wrote the classic \u201cThe Killer Angels\u201d upon which the movie Gettysburg was based died too soon at age 59. His son Jeff picked up where Michael left off by writing \u201cOf Gods & Generals\u201d, a prequel to Gettysburg & this book about Vicksburg, \u201cA Chain Of Thunder...\u201d Shaara\u2019s book gets into the heads and develops the characters of not only Grant, William Tecumseh Sherman & other Yankees, but also Confederate General John C Pemberton who was ironically, a Philadelphia Yankee whose pedigree always prevented him from earning the respect of his southern born colleagues during the siege. Jefferson Davis liked him and gave Pemberton his command but he is credited with the loss & Shaara artfully points out why. I visited Vicksburg two years ago while on a professional visit to New Orleans. A Chain Of Thunder brings the siege to life. In fact, Grant\u2019s victory there on the same day as Meade\u2019s victory over Lee at Gettysburg gave Lincoln two crucial victories & a new commanding General, Grant, with whom, he would finish the war. Shaara is a very good author & explains why Vicksburg is so important to the Northern cause but even more, Shaara\u2019s development of the characters, helped me understand why these men were able to go on and win the war between the states. If you like history, Shaara\u2019s Chain Of Thunder is a must."}, {"userName": "Elgin", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2615246-elgin", "userReview": "Another excellent book by Jeff Shaara. I have read two \"real history\" novels about Vicksburg, but as always, Shaara brought a new dimension to my understanding. Yes, I know it is historical FICTION, but I take the author at his word that he only writes thoughts and conversations that he feels are reflected in historical accounts. Too many authors focus on the generals and political leaders. Grant did an outstanding job with Grant, Sherman (especially) and Pemberton, but also spent several chapters on Fritz Bauer (a Union private) and Lucy Spence a young single woman who lived in Vicksburg. I very much enjoyed the accounts of the fighting to the East of Vicksburg, the distrust of Confederate troops for Pemberton, the seeming indifference of Johnston, and the detailed descriptions about how the Union Engineers oversaw the pushing of the siege lines closer and closer to the city. Moreover the chapters about the suffering of the CSA troops and the Vicksburg citizens (seen through the eyes of Lucy Spence) was both gripping and horrifying. I have read very little about the war from the point of view of the civilians; it is not only the soldiers that suffer.I am anxious to read the other volumes in Shaara's novels about the Western theater of the Civil War."}, {"userName": "Kenneth Barber", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12840025-kenneth-barber", "userReview": "With his usual story telling expertise, Shaara tells the events of the dive at Vicksburg. Beginning with the attempts by Grant to get his army and supplies past the guns of Vicksburg, the book follows the campaign through Mississippi to come up to Vicksburg from the land side. After three assaults are repulsed, grant settles in to lay siege to the city. Told through the experiences of the officers from both sides, common soldiers, and civilians, it details the battle and life in the besieged city. The author relates the struggles within commands of both Grant and Pemberton. The travails of the citizens within Vicksburg are told through the eyes of Lucy Spence who volunteered as a nurse in the Confederate hospital. Forced to live in caves with little food or water and under constant shelling from Federal artillery and gunboats on the river, the people suffer the same deprivation as the army."}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1444762-jill", "userReview": "This fictionalized account of the 1863 Civil War Siege of Vicksburg has good and bad points.On the good side, well, it\u2019s the Civil War. You\u2019ve got such great characters in Grant and Sherman, and Vicksburg was a truly momentous victory for the North, arguably more so than Gettysburg, which occurred at the same time. Vicksburg gave the North the control of the Mississippi - absolutely critical, although Gettysburg provided an unparalleled psychological boost. But in any event, both are exciting and inspirational stories. (Jeff Shaara\u2019s father, Michael Shaara, won the 1975 Pulitzer Prize for his fictionalized account of the Battle of Gettysburg, Killer Angels.)Shaara chooses to tell the story of the Siege of Vicksburg by alternating among five main points of view: Northern Generals Sherman and Grant, Northern soldier Fritz Bauer, Southern General Pemberton, and a young female civilian in Vicksburg, Lucy Spence. The inclusion of a common soldier and a common citizen is a welcome addition to the usual Civil War stories that focus on the generals.Vicksburg was notable for so many reasons. One of the most important was the generalship of the Southern forces by John C. Pemberton. Pemberton was a Pennsylvania graduate of West Point who chose to support the South. He was also apparently a good friend of President Jefferson Davis, which, in addition to his northern birth, put him at odds with Joseph Johnston, who was in command of the entire Department of the West, and therefore Pemberton\u2019s superior. Johnson could be said to be the sixth main character of this story, even though he was largely invisible (just like in real life\u2026.) Johnson, to paraphrase Civil War expert James McPherson, was Davis\u2019s McClellan. He was loathe to bring his army to battle, but Davis couldn\u2019t get rid of him for political reasons, just as Lincoln had difficulty firing McClellan.At Vicksburg, Pemberton repeatedly wired Johnston for help, and Johnston repeatedly denied it to him. Then, after Pemberton\u2019s surrender (unfortunately for Pemberton made on July 4), Johnston used his southern credentials and popularity to smear Pemberton, blaming him for what happened, and making sure he would never again be accepted as a commander.Shaara does a good job of portraying Pemberton in a way that manages to get readers to feel undecided about him. He is shown as quite obnoxious, but still inspires sympathy. After all, he is trying his best to save Vicksburg, but no matter what he does, he is hated by the men for his northern origins. He reacts defensively and aggressively - which didn\u2019t help his case much, although it may not have mattered to the Southerners even if he had not. It is also clear that Johnston bears a large part of the blame for the loss of Vicksburg. And of course, to some extent, up against the likes of Grant and a vastly superior supply train, it is probable victory was inevitable no matter what anyone did. (And to this end, Johnston may have been correct in refusing to sacrifice his men for a lost cause, but he didn\u2019t have any problem sacrificing Pemberton and his men.) My only complaint about the depiction of Pemberton is that Shaara endlessly rehearses Pemberton\u2019s anger over the lack of trust and respect given to him. Some serious editing would have helped.I was a bit perplexed over the relationship between the fictional soldiers, Private Fritz Bauer and his supposed good friend, Lieutenant Sam Willis. Willis consistently treats Bauer contemptuously. It didn\u2019t make sense to me. And Bauer is another character who goes on a bit too much and too long about his feelings during this engagement. It is certainly useful to show us war from the point of view of the soldiers: the fear, the comaraderie, the long hours of inaction and boredom, and the brief highs afforded by engagement. But again, it just got very repetitive.In fact, almost all of the characters got repetitive and therefore boring, even Sherman. We don\u2019t need more than one monologue to make the point about the nature their concerns.Lucy Spense, 19, is a composite character made by Shaara, who drew upon four different diaries of Vicksburg female civilians. Her observations about the horror and terror and hunger of the siege were interesting, but her story was a bit mysterious as well. Her mother was dead, her father had abandoned her a long time ago, and she was a Southern Belle who didn\u2019t work; how did she support herself? How did she feed and clothe herself and maintain her house? This was never explained. In his Afterword, Shaara tells what befell the main actors at Vicksburg after the surrender. He includes a paragraph about Spense (and some of the other fictional characters). I did not feel the Afterword was an appropriate place to mix fiction and non-fiction, at least not without acknowledging which was which.Moving on to more positive observations, the battle summaries are good, and although the paper form of the book includes a number of maps showing troop movements, the text was sufficiently illuminating that I was able to follow the action without seeing them, since I listened to this book on audio. Shaara also gave a huge amount of exposure and credit to the engineers on both sides, another aspect of battles not often discussed, but one particularly critical during a siege. Shaara shows in detail the outstanding job each side did working with shovels and trenches to maximize the effectiveness of weapons and artillery, and minimize the dangers from the other side.Evaluation: It has to be said that with material like the siege of Vicksburg, it\u2019s pretty hard not to make a pretty good story out of it. I would have liked to see some editing of the long interior monologues of some of the characters, but it was still an enjoyable story.Rating:\u00a0 3.5/5"}, {"userName": "George", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9245159-george", "userReview": "Shaara continues with his Civil War series with the second novel in the Western Theater. As with other books by the author, every chapter is told from the point of view of a different character, most historical figures, but others not. The cast of characters is varied, from Generals Grant, Sherman, and Pemberton to simple soldiers and civilians. I particularly enjoyed the perspective of the Union Soldier, Fritz Bauer and the Vicksbug civilian, Lucy Spence...but, their contributions would be less effective without the dialogue from the leadership of both sides. The novel could have been improved by providing a perspective of David Porter, the commander of the Union fleet in the Mississippi River; however, the book was already 22 hours long and required long periods of intense listening to get the theme and plot"}, {"userName": "Jay", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3255414-jay", "userReview": "Six weeks ago I visited Vicksburg, knowing surprisingly little about the battle there.

In A Chain of Thunder,  the action shifts to the fortress city of Vicksburg, Mississippi. There, in the vaunted \"Gibraltar of the Confederacy,\" a siege for the ages will cement the reputation of one Union general--and all but seal the fate of the rebel cause.In May 1863, after months of hard and bitter combat, Union troops under the command of Major General Ulysses S. Grant at long last successfully cross the Mississippi River. They force the remnants of Confederate Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton's army to retreat to Vicksburg, burning the bridges over the Big Black River in its path. But after sustaining heavy casualties in two failed assaults against the rebels, Union soldiers are losing confidence and morale is low. Grant reluctantly decides to lay siege to the city, trapping soldiers and civilians alike inside an iron ring of Federal entrenchments. Six weeks later, the starving and destitute Southerners finally surrender, yielding command of the Mississippi River to the Union forces on July 4--Independence Day--and marking a crucial turning point in the Civil War.Drawing on comprehensive research and his own intimate knowledge of the Vicksburg Campaign, Jeff Shaara once again weaves brilliant fiction out of the ragged cloth of historical fact. From the command tents where generals plot strategy to the ruined mansions where beleaguered citizens huddle for safety, this is a panoramic portrait of men and women whose lives are forever altered by the siege. On one side stand the emerging legend Grant, his irascible second William T. Sherman, and the youthful \"grunt\" Private Fritz Bauer; on the other, the Confederate commanders Pemberton and Joseph Johnston, as well as nineteen-year-old Lucy Spence, a civilian doing her best to survive in the besieged city. By giving voice to their experiences at Vicksburg, A Chain of Thunder vividly evokes a battle whose outcome still reverberates more than 150 years after the cannons fell silent.", "title": "A Chain of Thunder\n      \n          (Civil War: 1861-1865, Western Theater #2)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15981669-a-chain-of-thunder", "average": 4.15, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1360096615l/15981669.jpg", "reviews": 272, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14655.Jeff_Shaara", "name": "Jeff Shaara"}], "type": ["Historical", "Military History", "Fiction", "War"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15981669-a-chain-of-thunder", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18730317-a-chain-of-thunder", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15981689-a-chain-of-thunder", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16644333-a-chain-of-thunder", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29925.Gods_and_Generals", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29923.The_Last_Full_Measure", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36446571-rise-to-rebellion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29917.The_Rising_Tide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/785003.The_Glorious_Cause", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
