She was the only person I\u2019d ever seen with a parasol. She held it in one hand. With the other, she was hanging onto the fingers of a girl about my age with hair the color of orange Kool-Aid. I wanted to take a pen and connect the freckles on her face into funny constellations. We\u2019d already had our talk about the birds and the bees. At that time what she\u2019d said had so repulsed me I\u2019d vowed to stay a virgin forever.Most kids had decorated the inside door of their lockers with magazine pictures of teen idols or big bold words cut from advertisements: Fresh! Just do it! Sexy. The only picture in Matt\u2019s locker was a sepia-toned postcard of Einstein on a bicycle.I\u2019d had a taste of adventure and I knew I wanted more\u2026 In the meantime, I was under house arrest.I was terrified of telling my parents\u2026 the biggest scandal in the family since my great-grandmother, the flame-haired Margaret Stieg, in her fur coat and pearls, had hopped onto a train with her (alleged) bootlegger boyfriend, and disappeared out west, where there was hardly any water. Would my name be banned from conversation one day too?My Review:I vacillated and wavered in how to rate this amusing and insightful coming of age tale. I adored the vast majority of this keenly observant and emotive first person narrative and while reviewing my notes and favorite quotes \u2013 I found myself smiling. So shrugging \u2013 I have to give this tale a full five-star rating for the quality of the writing alone. Ms. Kamata has produced an outstandingly accurate depiction of the time period and fully captured the thought processes, outlook, and constricted life experiences of a young girl living in a small town during the 1970s. I know this as fact and entirely all too well, as it felt like she was pulling snippets from that dusty file cabinet tucked away in the corner of my brain that is untidily packed with childhood memories. In reading Ms. Kamata\u2019s engaging words, vivid memories and feelings that I had not summoned for ions began to surface and wash over me. Like Elise, I also came of age in a small town during the 70\u2019s, with one sister and extremely religious and uptight white conservative parents. Although I must confess, Elise\u2019s family was actually much nicer than mine ever tried to be. For much of the story I could have been Elise, so it quickly became personal and very real to me. I definitely recall thinking and feeling in a similar manner as detailed in her entertaining observations; the embarrassing mistakes and sense of confusion that occurred from the literal mindset of youth, as well as feeling painfully constrained by the rigid expectations of over-controlling parents as well as being totally lacking in useful life experience due to a complete dearth of choice, options, or exposure. I also recall the sense of being listless and bored stiff by the bland and colorless routine of a tightly religious and narrow-minded small-town community so that anything new or different had an immediate taint of the taboo so of course to me it was instantly thrilling, highly exciting, alluring, and exotic; which and also led to new and refreshing flights of fancy and hopeful daydreams all featuring me in the starring role. Ms. Kamata\u2019s craftily written tale adroitly detailed and portrayed that era and phase of life in a remarkably deft manner."}, {"userName": "Suze Lavender", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29148122-suze-lavender", "userReview": "It's the 1970s and Elise loves books. She's better with paper than people and her best friends are penpals. She loves Lake Michigan and is fascinated by her family history associated with the water. Elise doesn't socialize much, she likes spending time on her own. Her mother and sister are different in this area. Elise's mother used to be a beauty queen and still longs for those days. She wants her daughters to be popular and thrive, but Elise isn't interested. When Elise's younger sister Amanda starts dating the boy Elise is in love with Elise could definitely use some good in her life. Fortunately Chiara has just moved to town. Chiara doesn't care what other people think of her, she's free, opinionated and wild and she's exactly what Elise needs to come out of her shell.Elise changes under the influence of Chiara. She becomes more outspoken and finally finds her own style. When being at the carnival with Chiara Elise meets Miguel. He's a gypsy musician working there for a few days before traveling further. There's something brewing between them, but will Elise ever see him again once he moves on? What will be the influence of her new friends on her life?The Mermaids of Lake Michigan is a beautiful coming of age story. I immediately liked Elise. She's smart and kind. She doesn't have much going on in her life, but fills her days with books. That changes when she meets Chiara. She's finally found someone interesting enough to become friends with. Chiara does whatever she wants and that is something new for Elise. She's a good girl, used to certain rules, but for Chiara there are none, which has a lot more appeal. Of course this new way of life can easily get out of hand and I was really curious to find out what would happen next. I found myself surprised numerous times, which is something I liked a lot.Suzanne Kamata has written a fantastic story and I loved the vivid way she describes her main characters and their emotions. It wasn't difficult to picture why Elise would feel enchanted by Miguel. I liked the way their connection was being described and it made me anxious to keep reading from the moment they meet. Their relationship has plenty of layers and it's fabulously messy. Elise is growing up quickly and that process was amazing to watch. She has to make her own decisions and life isn't always fair, which is a fascinating theme for a story. I was mesmerized by The Mermaids of Lake Michigan from the very first page and absolutely loved this terrific story."}, {"userName": "Deb", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1090093-deb", "userReview": "I admit to being a sucker for a good coming-of-age story, especially one set in the 70s or 80s with an engaging main character. Elise Faulkner of The Mermaids of Lake Michigan won me over from the start. A bit of an introvert, Elise would rather read a book or write to her pen-pals from other countries than actually interact with others. She believes in mermaids (her great grandmother was a wreck diver who swore she saw one once) and she feels different and set apart from her family and the people in her small town of Grand Rapids, Michigan. The summer she is seventeen she befriends Chiara, her neighbor's granddaughter and falls in love with a young Romani drifter and her life changes as she tries to navigate life and adulthood.The Mermaids of Lake Michigan is less than 200 pages but it feels like a longer book with its beautiful writing and depth of character and story. Suzanne Kamata skillfully captures the feelings of growing up in a small town in the 1970s and although I went through my adolescence about a decade later, across the country in the Pacific Northwest, I could definitely relate to Elise and her thoughts and feelings. There is a bit of magical realism woven into the store but it is subtle and doesn't take away from the very real moments. This is a wonderful book to curl up with and go back in time to adolescence, both the heady, brilliant moments and the painful, sometimes crushing ones.

First of all, it's amazing how much fun it is to read books written for young people. Yesterday I set myself to get through the second half of Mermaids and it didn't take long. I'm going to say I enjoyed the second half even more than the first. The story went from the life of a normal, everyday, teenage heroine happier at home reading books than leaving the house, to that of a teenager old-beyond-her-years confidently setting off across the country to find her Gypsy lover. For a while, I was thinking \"Whaa--?\" and then as I really got into this second half, I was thinking, \"Ooh, why not?\" There were so many more details that I would have loved to have had about all of the characters and the settings--I think this would make a great movie because you could show the scenes without providing blow-by-blow descriptions and it would be a beautiful love story or stories. I also thought of \"Juno,\" a film I loved. Mermaids is about a Juno who ended up not solving her problems, which might make it even more satisfying for me, the non-YA reader."}, {"userName": "Carrie Schmidt (Reading is My SuperPower)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6084197-carrie-schmidt-reading-is-my-superpower", "userReview": "3.5 starsThe Mermaids of Lake Michigan did not at all play out the way I expected. And that\u2019s not really a bad thing. Just different.I had in mind that I\u2019d be reading something a la Sarah Addison Allen and Lost Lake. And while there IS the teeniest bit of magical realism at the end, it\u2019s really not the focus of the book at all. Yet, the theme of mermaids carries on at a deeper level than first anticipated as well.Though not a literal mermaid, Elise is certainly a fish out of water among her family and peers. Later, as she sheds her figurative fins for walking legs, she \u2013 much like the most famous of mermaids \u2013 discovers life \u201con land\u201d isn\u2019t quite as perfect as she\u2019d imagined.This is a short novel, a quick read, but it never feels rushed. The author\u2019s writing style flows smoothly, and she keeps the reader engaged with the story at every turn. Each character that Elise encounters has a purpose, whether it\u2019s a brief meeting or a family member. These characters, as well as excellent examples of foreshadowing, all serve to advance the plot and to add more layers to Elise\u2019s character.No spoilers \u2026 but I felt a certain scene toward the end of the book seemed out of place. I get why it\u2019s in there, but it threw me. And it just didn\u2019t fit with the tone of the story up until that part. Without it, I think the ending would have been just as poignant. Maybe even more so.Bottom Line: If you\u2019re looking for a coming-of-age story that appeals to adolescents, young adults, and less-young adults, The Mermaids of Lake Michigan proves a compelling choice. It takes place around the 1970s so it\u2019s not really contemporary, not really historical, but somewhere in between. Different than I expected at first glance, it continued to take me by surprise but overall I enjoyed this read.Reviewer\u2019s Note: Readers may want to be aware that there is some foul language in this book, as well as some implied (but not explicitly described) scenes of an intimate nature.(I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book.)see my review at Reading Is My SuperPower"}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6751264-becky", "userReview": "Elise would much rather spend time indoors with a good book than anything else. It's a proclivity her once beauty queen mother simply can't understand. So when the neighbor's granddaughter moves in, prompting the neighbor to ask Elise to spend time with her, Elise immediately wants to say no. And yet, something prompts her to change her mind. What she discovers is that the neighbor hopes Elise will be a good influence on Chiara. Instead, it's the other way around. And while Chiara is wild and outgoing, her influence on Elise allows the girl to finally come out of her shell and live.The Mermaids of Lake Michigan is a character-driven coming of age tale set in the midwest in the 70s.Elise is a great narrator. One who observes rather big occurrences even at a very young age. And so she shares some of these with very little, if any, understanding or judgement. Most of these instances pertain to Elise's mother, who the reader comes to find is actually quite unhappy with her life.But those instances are like little glimpses through the window's of Elise's tale. The rest, the time spent with Chiara, the fascination with her great-grandmother's stories, and her budding romance, are given the full on treatment as Elise lives through them.Suzanne Kamata's latest blends just a touch of magic and whimsy throughout, endearing readers even more to Elise as she navigates the troubled waters of young adulthood. It's a short read, but one that packs a punch."}, {"userName": "Marcus", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/558652-marcus", "userReview": "\"The Mermaids of Lake Michigan\" is a heart-rending coming-of-age story that kept surprising me from beginning to end.The story is centered around Elise Faulkner and told from her point of view as a young child and as a high-school student. Both POVs were uniquely engaging. I liked how the young Elise didn't really understand everything around her, describing what she saw and letting the reader work out what was really going on.The elder Elise went on a physical and emotional journey I absolutely did not expect. She's a bookish outcast who meets a red-haired wild child (who smokes!) and becomes enamored with the idea of leaving her dull life for life of adventure. I thought this thing was gonna go full John Green.Instead Elise starts making bad decisions that compound into worse decisions until I was reading the whole book in one sitting with my heart pounding in my throat. Her nativity in the face of the \"real world\" was heartbreaking, and I spent the second half of the book wondering how (or if) things could ever work out for her.On top of the engaging characters, this book also has beautiful prose. The kind that you highlight just because you want to look back later and remember it exists."}, {"userName": "Monika", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3970914-monika", "userReview": "I did enjoy the writing style and flow enough to keep reading and finish the book.

The writing style and story was reminiscent of Alice Hoffman and Rebecca Wells. The plot was interesting, sprinkled with flashbacks from the main character's childhood, and the characters decently compelling. Most of them, anyway. The overall book had a rather surreal feel to it, despite the story itself being relatively mundane for the first 3/4 of its telling. It has a potential depth for it, yet seemed somehow to only scratch the surface of that depth, and for being a short and relatively simple story it managed to hook into the mind and make one ponder after it long after the back cover had closed, which is the hallmark of a good book.This book takes place in the 80's or 90's - long before the advent of cellphones and the widespread use of computers. Elise is a studious, introverted high school senior whose mother wants her to have more friends. Any friends, really. Her mother sets her up with a \"friend date\" with their elderly neighbor's granddaughter, Chiara, who is in town because her mother is going through (yet another) divorce. Chiara ends up being a bit of a loose canon, bent on enjoying her freedom after being cooped up in boarding schools for so much time. Elise is enchanted with Chiara. Through Chiara's influence, Elise is pulled out of her shell and into trouble, the trouble ultimately culminating in an illicit trip to Chicago.This is where the story goes rather... off the rails, as far as I'm concerned, and where the author attempts to blend the fantastical with the real. Unfortunately, for me, it is not done well, as the fantastical element to the story up until now is a brief mention of a hallucination had by an oxygen-deprived wreck-diving great-grandmother (who, in my opinion, should have a book to herself because she seems like a fascinating character) a bad pickup line, and the kind of lust that can only be generated by teenage hormones.Suddenly the plot shifts into one where \"fate\" is an acceptable reason for doing just about anything as Elise runs away from home in search of a musically-talented Roma man whom she has met all of three times, and who himself is wandering about the country. Eventually returning home, she herself winds up deprived of oxygen and, surprise! Has a similar hallucination to her great-grandmother's.Overall, I enjoyed this book. It was a quick read, and something that I think strives to be deeper than it is. I think this book, it's story, and it's characters, had great potential and I'd like to have seen everything fleshed out a bit more.The characters were decently written, though the primary ones went through little development for a \"coming of age\" story. I appreciated that the writer attempted to draw parallels between Elise, her mother, and her great-grandmother, and the story being book-ended by the carnival (in three separate places) was also critically pleasing. Written by a native Michigander, I appreciated all of the local references and the manner in which they were presented - there wasn't a, \"look! I did research on this location, or maybe visited it once! And this very irrelevant tidbit is here to prove it! LOOK AT IT\" feel to it, but rather it was very natural. One of the scenes in particular I enjoyed was the description of the youth group - a bunch of rambunctious teenagers being precisely what their parents/teachers/church elders want them to be while they're looking, and then doing precisely what their rambunctious teenager selves wanted to do once backs were turned. It was this scene, more than any other, that drew me into the book.I would recommend this book for high school readers and older. There is no explicit sex or violence, and little explicit language.

She has never been one for social functions, as she is more prone to read a good book or send pen pal letters to other girls around the world that she has never met. However, her mom wants her to be more like her sister, who has an active boyfriend and goes out all the time. So, she sets her up with a neighbor\u2019s granddaughter who is visiting. When Elsie meets Chiara, she starts making a friend right away. Chiara is different from other people and doesn\u2019t care what anyone thinks. She also doesn\u2019t think any of the dreams that Elise has are weird. They really hit it off great, but Chiara is far from a positive role model. She is a drinker, smoker, and likes to skip school. She even manages to talk Elise into taking a road trip into Chicago with her one weekend which will change Elise\u2019s life forever.This was a very different book than what I was expecting. First of all, it really reads more like a memoir than fiction, which is really kind of fascinating in itself. Second, I didn\u2019t realize that is was going to be set in the 1970s and the author did a great job of setting the scene for that. From the beauty pageant to the parades, it really felt nostalgic when reading. But the best part was the overall character development of Elise. She started out what seemed very shallow and reserved, but grew throughout the story over her time with Chiara and then when looking for Miguel. There was definitely a twist thrown in there that really ramped up the conflict of the story. The point of view remained through an eighteen year old girl\u2019s eyes. Her experiences and memories really seemed true to the events that took place.There is some language throughout this book as well as a mild sex scene. There are also some scenes that depict underage smoking, drinking, and drug use. I recommend this for mature young adults and up.I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher.

For at least the first 10 chapters, time goes back and forth from the main character being a little girl, to her current age, high school senior. And by the way--this is a total guess. I never specifically read either an age for the narrator and her sister, OR a year when this story takes place. Though the few context clues lead to the late 70's.Our main character is Elise. Though she's the older sister, she's always been outshone by her little sis's grace and beauty. So when free spirited Chiara breezes into town, bookish Elise is quickly enamored of the colorful world she experiences with her and they become best friends.Though I thought that Elise had a good head on her shoulders, it doesn't take her long to follow in Chiara's not so innocent footsteps and lead her life down a spiraling path. I suppose we as readers are meant to surmise that Elise is tired of being the good girl that always comes in second best, but this just didn't come across for me. Elise meets a guy twice and is instantly in love with him. She makes terrible decision after terrible decision, and into her life come a parade of random people that in the end, don't mean that much to the story.This novel was a very fast read, but I can't say it was for me at all. The things Elise did just were not smart, even though I guess she felt she had no other choice. She's also BEYOND naive and even seeing some of the shadier sides of the world beyond her town does nothing to make her face reality. I was glad when the ending came but it left a lot to be desired."}, {"userName": "Chris Lindsay", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9344591-chris-lindsay", "userReview": "The Mermaids of Lake Michigan is a young adult story that illustrates how a good coming of age story can be told with a literary touch. Themes and motifs are told and developed throughout the book, and its supporting characters, interesting backstories, and tangential asides all become important in the development of young Elise Faulkner\u2019s maturation into a woman. The writing was good, but the themes and characters were very good \u2013 especially for such a short novel. A little more description of the place and time may have helped provide a more rich context to the characters\u2019 feelings and actions \u2013 which could help the reader be more interested in them. But I thought the story did a great job of describing the mental and physical maturation of Elise in several ways: use of comparative then and now events, use of ancestors\u2019 backstories that foreshadow actions by Elise, and introducing supporting characters that help teach Elise about the ways of the world in a way that\u2019s subtle and matter-of-factly. There are young adult stories that may be better written, but this one strips away a lot of superfluous details and focuses just on the story that needs to be told \u2013 and still manages to retain literary qualities that can be appreciated and contemplated by the reader."}, {"userName": "Anonymous", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56712240-anonymous", "userReview": "3 stars. It\u2019s been a few years since I\u2019ve picked up a book like this, so when the opportunity presented itself, I thought \u2018eh, why not\u2019. Just the break in my usual book routine made it a somewhat entertaining read. The author\u2019s writing style is really easy to follow; it flows from thought to thought with minimal problems. The pacing is nice too, there is minimal filler between various action scenes, just enough to give the reader a break between moments, but not enough for you to completely get lost or lose interest. The scene descriptions are rather well done as well, I very much enjoyed those. The one nagging thing I wish was specified, was the era this work takes place in. Most points I get the sense we\u2019re in the 90\u2019s or some pre-cell phone era, filled this those wonderful cord phones that curly-cued their way through houses and those ever so fun pay phones. The rest of the time, I get the sense it\u2019s completely modern. Where the book falls flat for me are the characters and the plot itself. The characters, albeit clich\u00e9, are given just enough individual quirks to make them stand out in the reader\u2019s memory- which is rather difficult to manage when you have upwards of ten different ones throughout the length of a work. Those quirks were nice; they helped me keep track of who was who as I read. Unfortunately other than that, they came off as rather static, flat and random in their decisions. The main character does things impulsively, and while that might be mimicking a stereotypical teenage girl, it doesn\u2019t really do anything for the reader-to-character connection. In fact, there wasn\u2019t much of a connection to the characters. You learned about them, you watched them worry and fret about things and live a teenage life, but you didn\u2019t really get much deeper than that. There were glimmers in the very beginning of the book where the main character was trying to understand the person her mother was, where you, the reader, got to sort of connect to her, but since that was only touched on in the end it fell flat by about halfway through the book. That was one of the highlights, in that regard. If the narrator did something rash or stupid, especially later in the book, I found I didn\u2019t care, she asked for it by blindly following some secondary character or some half-thought out decision. It\u2019s even more fitting when the worst repercussion given is a simple grounding, or despite not thinking much through, everything worked out with minimal hitches.Characters you expected to hold a greater role (especially in reading the blurb) end up actually not being around much by the end, with a character end to one that is poorly led up to and kind of tossed in out of the blue. It felt like an attempt at a plot twist that really, other than the main\u2019s obsession with honoring their memory and life in a few ways, turned around and made the reader question the character\u2019s point in the plot in the first place. The plot though, did make sure that these characters had a place. Each one was a catalyst for the main to do one thing or another, or a supporting character in the main\u2019s exploits. The other strong point the plot has going for it is that the author didn\u2019t forget anything she foreshadowed. Little details came full circle and had some sort of an end point. That was about it. The plot becomes muddled when the author seems to suddenly switch thoughts and decide to add gypsies to the mix. What started out as what appeared to be a mermaid story suddenly became a duel plot; both sides warring for the same characters, time and place. And, as you expect for such a short book, both plots are severely weakened and lackluster as a result, despite the author\u2019s best efforts to wrap everything together at the end. They\u2019re just too different, too strong on their own to be paired together like this- though the promise of something really good is there. The beginning of the work also held the promise for something different. I actually liked the beginning, though as I reflect back as I\u2019m writing this review, I cannot figure out the point for it. Take it out, and the story wouldn\u2019t really be affected. The things the character suddenly draws in from the past in the present (a train ticket of her mother\u2019s, meeting the secondary character some point in the distant past) were either only pulled in to give several pages of background or to give the main leverage over her mother in the present. Some character reflections, while taking pages to build up to only are mentioned in passing later or completely forgotten about. It doesn\u2019t make sense, and kind of gives the reader the sense that their time is being wasted for nothing. The penpal in Ghana doesn\u2019t have a greater role. The potential was there, but it was casted out halfway through. Mermaids take a backseat to gypsies, despite being in the title and significantly in the blurb. You expect to walk into the book with this being another YA romance-y clich\u00e9 (don\u2019t worry there are plenty of those clich\u00e9s throughout this work) with mermaids or mermen, but you get neither- just this passing moment with what the character believes she sees, the emphasis and drive behind this whole plot are the gypsy part of the plot, and a good part of that was never really explained to give the full effect. So why the three stars? I see the potential for a greater book that didn\u2019t hold the feel of just being slapped together in the end. The blurb shared it by making it sound like so much that it just didn\u2019t end up being, which is both disappointing and explains exactly why those two concepts aren\u2019t found together in the same pages that often. They\u2019re too different, too difficult to place in the same plot without one overshadowing the other. Disclaimer: I received a copy of this book for free in exchange for writing a review.

It is a coming of age story, with consequences from questionable decision making. The story is set in the 1980's, and takes place in my home state, which makes it especially interesting.

I'm from Michigan, and I love mermaids. But this went in a direction that I wasn't envisioning. After a certain point, I'll be honest - I started jumping forward. It's defintely more a \"coming of age drama and romance\" kind of story. I was hoping for more fantasy. What disappointed me was the unexpected pregnancy and tragic death aspect to the story. If this is what \"coming of age\" means, I need to stop reading coming of age stories. The author could have left the pregnancy out completely and it still would have been plausable."}, {"userName": "Ricki Treleaven", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3749793-ricki-treleaven", "userReview": "I enjoyed the first part of this book quite a bit because Elise is coming of age during the eighties: She is in high school during my era. She has an interesting family history, and she's smart. Then the bad egg in the guise of Chiara arrives and her influence on Elise isn't good. Elise makes one poor choice after another, and then the plot slides downhill from there.There is a slight element of fantasy (mermaids) and magical realism (fortune-telling gypsy) in the book, and I wish Kamata had explored it a bit more. Miguel's character is confusing. During the first half of the book he's full of life, music, and song. The second half: not so much. I have many questions about him that aren't answered in the story. Nevertheless, I was satisfied with the ending, and I enjoyed the book. If you enjoy family dramas and books with feminist elements, you'll enjoy this book. It's a very short read and would be perfect for a flight or a quick weekend read.Disclosure: I received a copy of The Mermaids of Lake Michigan from the publisher via TLC Book Tours in exchange for a fair and honest review."}, {"userName": "Kari", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/101554-kari", "userReview": "So, after finishing The Mermaids of Lake Michigan, I really had to sit on it for a while to decide my opinion. The book is about Elise. She is a bookworm and loves to be antisocial. When she meets Chiara and a mysterious love interest, her world changes in ways she couldn't imagine. That is the book I thought I was getting. In the end, I'm not sure I connected with the story as much as I had hoped I would. I did enjoy the parts about Elise's childhood and her interactions with her mother. Those kept my interest and had the story been more about her and her mother, I might have liked it more. I never really felt like I connected with any of the characters. Elise was initially a bookworm and reminded me of myself at her age. She was content to read all day and not talk to anyone. As the story progressed, the similarities stopped there. I couldn't reconcile the bookworm and straight A student with the girl who all of a sudden makes really bad decisions. That is where the story fell apart for me. I never saw any growth in Elise even in the end. Everything seemed to fall too much into place for her and there were too many coincidences to be believable. Even the \"consequences\" she gets for her bad decisions are just too easy. The ending was really quick and left me with questions about Miguel and what came next. In the end, I'm not sure this was for me. I didn't find the \"coming of age story\" that I was hoping to get. It has received a lot of good reviews from others, so make sure to check them out. The writing is good, it's just the story I didn't care for. Give it a shot and try it for yourself."}, {"userName": "Wall-to-wall books - wendy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2281076-wall-to-wall-books---wendy", "userReview": "This was a very \"different\" book and not what I thought it was going to be at all! And I am not sure if that was a good thing or not.To be honest when I started reading this book I thought that I might not even finish it, it started out very slow for me. But then halfway through something happened it was like Bam! Different story, different author, totally different feeling. The story got interesting, exciting, very heartfelt, and sad.And the whole time I was reading the first half of the book I kept thinking \"what the heck does this even have to do with mermaids, did I misunderstand.\" But then again\u2026 Well I can't tell you! That would ruin the story. All I can say is that by the time I was finished with this book I was crying and so glad that I had continued reading.At first I didn't like Elise, frankly she bored me. I liked her friend, Chiara. Now there was an exciting girl with some guts! But then again halfway through the book Elise started to change and she started to remind me of a younger me. I was a lot like her when I was her age. I just wanted to live life with a reckless abandon. I tried things that other people would scoff at. Now here was an Elise I could relate to.All in all, slow beginning, last half of the book was better, with an excellent ending! While this won't go down as one of my favorite books - It was definitely worth the read. I voluntarily posted this review after receiving a copy of this book from TLC Book Tours - Thank You!"}, {"userName": "Just Commonly", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19895197-just-commonly", "userReview": "The Mermaids of Lake Michigan by Suzanne Kamata is about change, growth and reality. Set in the 1970s, this coming of age novel surprised me with its disconnect that connects. The story itself reads like a journal, a memoir of sort that sees to the growth of our main character Elise. And because of that, it reads exactly like what it is, a teenager's journal, with added depth. Sometimes you see the development in Elise's character, and then the next, it reverts itself back to uncertainties. I had a hard time connecting with the characters. They were all too distinct with the stereotype they each played which gives way to understand where that character is coming from. However, it also doesn't seem to flow or connect with each other on an emotional level. Despite that, I am impressed by the fluidity of the author's writing style, as well as how she handled intimacy which was alluded and not expressive, matching the style we've come to expect. It's surprising how as we near the end, how well executed all plot points were. Everything is full circle and everything had its purpose, creating that connection that I felt lacked in characters. Sometimes it's just a story, and this is Elise's story.For my clean readers, please note there are some language, mild intimacy and scenes of drug use, teenage smoking and drinking in this book.
