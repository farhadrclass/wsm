After the events of the previous book, James is still recovering from his injuries, and is taking a semester off from Eton. His Aunt Charmian had a schedule expedition in the jungles of Mexico and has decided to bring him along. While she does her assignment, James is going to be staying with her friend Jack Stone, a former flying ace from the war.Just as they are arriving, a hurricane comes ashore. Jack Stone offers to fly Charmian out to her expedition with the hopes that she can make it before things go bad. James will remain in the Stone mansion with Jack's children: Precious, a girl his own age with quite the empress complex, and JJ, a sweet kid who just wants someone to play with. As the storm is coming ashore, the Stone estate gets some company.A group of thieves have decided to try and take advantage of the storm to take Jack Stone's safe. They are a bit disappointed that Stone is not there and decide to take Stone's children along for the ride. James, pretending to be a local hoodlum, goes along for the ride in the hopes of saving the kids and recovering the stolen goods.Off the coast of Mexico is the island of Lagrimas Negras, which has become a hideaway for a number of scary criminals. To stay in the haven all they have to do is turn over a huge amount of funds to El Huracan, the \"governor\" of the island. The only problem is that no one leaves the island once they arrive. The idea is to protect the sanctity of the haven. The only way to get off is through an obstacle course, called La Avenida de la Muerte (the Avenue of Death) that follows a theme related to the ancient Mayan gods. No one has ever completed the gauntlet before.As you can probably guess, James will find his way onto Lagrimas Negras in the course of his adventures in Mexico. The only way he is going to get to save the girl, recover the treasure, and get out alive is take the challenge of the gauntlet.This, the fourth volume, is a nice addition to the series. Like the earlier novels, it is a typical Bond story, full of action, deception, and a quick pace. The series is a bit more challenging than the Alex Rider series by Anthony Horowitz, but they are just as good."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13672657-kate", "userReview": "I decided to read this book because I had read the first ones in the series and really wanted to read to this one so when I saw it in the library I as over the moon and got it out instantly.This book fits under the category of \u2018a book with a male main character\u2019. I think that this is a great category as a lot of books fit under it and it gives a wide range of freedom. I like reading books about male main characters, as they are more out going in the dangerous side of things. For example James faces a crocodile and a jaguar just to get of an island, as it was the only way. \u201cWhen Manny turned his head, James could see that he was badly injured. A section of his skull above his right ear had broken away and was hanging loose, still attached by a flap of hair-covered skin.As he moved, the flap swung backwards and forwards like a door opening and closing. And as it opened it revealed a glistening patch of pinkish-grey brain behind a rubbery membrane.\" I like how he describes his skull as it means that you can imagine it and it is a vivid image. The phrase 'a rubbery membrane' makes you feel as if you can touch it and feel the brain through the jelly like surface. This is just one of the many sections in the book that I have really enjoyed and I couldn't stop myself from reading it and all my free time I would be reading. I learnt from this book a bit about the landscape of Mexico and what it looks like. Vera Cruz is on the cost of Mexico and is close to the jungle around the old ruins of the lost city. The big cities in Mexico and separated by vast amounts of farmland and no mans land with little villages in-between them."}, {"userName": "Colin Gibson", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3238101-colin-gibson", "userReview": "This is by far the best young James Bond book.

I am sad I only have one Charlie Higson Bond book left. These have all been action packed, and Higson has nailed the Bond feel. With many truly evil villains to choose from, somehow you end up feeling something akin to sympathy for El Hurrican. I was a little wary at first of the similarities between HG and Dr. NO, but it ended up being more of a refreshing tribute than a copy. This book continued the theme of Bond being averse to using a gun to kill people. It is positioned as not wanting to kill in cold blood, but I am looking forward to the transformation into a Bond who can shoot when necessary. Again, great book. I would highly recommend this to bond fans or those who love action packed books.

There's no way around it, I'm afraid. Intrigue wise this story is beyond weak. It's a road trip without direction, taking you to an island of disbelief, ending in a gauntlet of incredulousness.

It does improve a great deal towards the end but I found that the story dragged quite a bit for the 1st 2/3rds of the book. The biggest problem I have with it is with the character of Precious, the lead female character and meant to be sort of a prototypical \"Bond-girl\". The story takes place shortly after the events of Double or Die with Bond on a trip to Mexico with his Aunt Charmain after the Xmas Holidays. It's decided that it's in Bond's best interest to prolong his return to Eton and remain in Mexico so that he could fully recover from the previous ordeal / adventure. Aunt Charmain decides she wants to go off on her own private Mayan ruins expedition and decides to leave young James with a family friend, Jack Stone, the pilot who will fly her to her remote location. It's here where the story gets a bit frustrating because right away we are introduced to Jack Stone's daughter Precious, who is made out to be extremely unlikeable and behaves as the stereotypical rich spoiled brat we've seen countless times and it comes across here as very annoying for both James and the reader. If Charlie Higson had made the character a bit more likeable in the beginning of the book then it might have been an easier story to get through but as soon as we meet her we see her treat the wait staff horribly and pull a nasty trick on young James while vying for her father's affection. Then, Precious undergoes an enormous and very implausible transformation whereby she becomes a strong-willed heroine summoning up the strength to help save young James' life pulling him out of the water on several occassions and lifting James with one hand as they tried to traverse a log full of army ants in the villain's obstacle course towards the end of the book. Of course by this point, the character has become humbled due to the circumstances of having been kidnapped and held hostage, but the entire transformation this character undergoes just felt forced and took me out of the book. The overall plot presents the reader with certain shades of both Dr.No and Live and Let Die. I just wish the execution and the character development of Precious were handled a bit better. It's not a bad story at all. If you're willing to overlook the mishandling of the Precious character the overall adventure is actually quite entertaining. Young James spends most of the story either captured or fleeing from a small group of gangsters led by Mrs. Glass who invaded the Stone house to get their hands on secret American naval documents that Stone had smuggled onto his plane. Their plan was to steal the naval documents and sell them to the highest bidder but things go awry when the plans aren't in the house and they're forced to take Precious and her little brother JJ hostage. Young James manages to follow along and fool them into thinking he's a Mexican pickpocket in order to join their gang hoping to save Precious and her brother when the opportunity presents itself, but of course James' plan doesn't go so smoothly and he ends up getting pursued and captured several points in the story. The highlights include Young James learning jiu jitsu from one of the gang members, a Japanese man named Sakata, who had thrown in with Mrs. Glass but who proves to be the most honorable of the gangsters when he decides to help get the injured younger child JJ to safety. The backstories of the gangsters are actually very well done and Mrs. Glass' backstory is fascinating and includes a nod to Legs Diamond. The final third of the book is really where the novel picks up. James and Precious find themselves on a private island set up as a haven for criminals and run by El Hurrican, who basically provides this safe haven with the condition that no one who enters the island is allowed to leave. Of course, the criminals think they've got it made when they get there but once they run out of money, El Hurrican forces them into slave labor. The only way off the island is to run a dangerous obstacle course called La Avenida de Muerte with each stage in the course set up as a tribute to various Mayan gods. Both Precious and young James decide to run the course and this sequence does make for a thrilling read. It's just that I had a hard time believing the necessary transformation Precious had to undergo before she could run the course along with James. Overall, I'd have to say this was the weakest Young Bond book I've read so far, but my disappointment is only there because the previous books had impressed me so much that I've set such an impossibly high standard for these books. It's worth the read if you're willing to overlook the flaws I mentioned, but the first 3 books are so amazingly brilliant that I've decided to give Charlie Higson a pass for this one and give 3 stars instead of 2."}, {"userName": "Michael Greene", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65064827-michael-greene", "userReview": "This was my favorite out of all the Young James Bond series!"}, {"userName": "Zach", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40627961-zach", "userReview": "Recently I read the book Hurricane Gold by Charlie Higson. The book was published by Ian Fleming Publications Ltd in 2009. Ian Fleming Publications Ltd is based out of the city of New York. I would recommend this book to people who enjoy reading a fast pace action adventure books with a bit of mystery and crime. \tHurricane Gold is based on the topic of two kids going missing and later finding they got abducted after a recent hurricane that has destroyed the children\u2019s town. Later to find out the Kid\u2019s father has a very valuable map to a military base. James Bond is the main charter and he attempts to help the kids by acting as a young Mexican thief and joining a gang. James goes through a hurricane damaged country of Mexico and eventually arrives on a Caribbean island called Lagrimas Negras to save the kids. They will be kept on the island for the rest of their lives unless the abductors get the map to the military base or James can come up with a solution to save them. \tThought the book the book Charlie Higson goes in between English and Spanish. Such as \u201cStand up and put your hands on your head, Senor!\u201d(Higson 221). I feel like this adds a great deal of importance to the book, because it helps make you feel like there is a strong Spanish culture where the book takes place, which there is. Also the book is written in a first person point of view, which works out well for this novel. The first person point of view is well because it allows the reader to feel like they are in the footsteps of the charters. For example when James says \u201cWhat am I to do with you both?\u201d(Higson 318). All thought the book there are all sorts of different charters talking in a first person point of view. Which adds a positive impact on the book.Hurricane Gold is the fourth book in the Young Bond series, with no movies based off of any of the books. Although movies have been created about the main charter James bond, only without being based off of the books. James bond movies have been very famous dating back to 1962 and his most recent movie Skyfall that hit the market in 2012. Also a new movie coming out in November of 2015 called Spectre. This book as well as all of the other books in the series would be great for anyone seeking a fast paced action adventure, thrilling read.In conclusion I would recommend this book to people who enjoy reading a fast pace action adventure books with a bit of mystery and crime. Will the famous James Bond save the kids? You must read the book to find out the mysterious ending."}, {"userName": "Simon Wood", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17058793-simon-wood", "userReview": "That became a chore.Of course it's not fair for me to judge this book on standard merits as it is essentially for kids. (Even if it is pretty shockingly violent at times.) I decided to read it because my ten year old nephew started with the series and it seemed like it could be fun. And it was, to start with. Some really well conceived and realized action set pieces, and a nice on-the-run-through-the-third-world kind of plot. But the biggest problem with the book is that it's at least a hundred pages too long.The set up is very flimsy, with young Bond happening to be in the wrong place when some baddies kidnap their intended victim's children and then drag them across country as they search for the kids' father in order to force him to trade them for what they're after. Which is all well and good, but the book doesn't have anything else in the way of twists and turns to offer to keep things interesting. It's just a case of Bond and the others escaping for a little while, struggling ever onwards, getting captured again, struggling ever onwards, escaping, captured, again - on and on - with every instance coming about because of incredibly silly motivations or utterly contrived coincidences. And then when it finally rolls round to the climax, the reasoning for it coming about is just painful - considering these children fall back into the baddies hands of their own free will because of some notion of saving the day, but with no plan or real need to do it. And thus, having to simply again escape capture.I got so tired of it that I sped read the last 60 pages.And like I said, it isn't really fair for me to judge it too harshly as it is a kids book.

Especially in the 3rd part of the book is where it gets really exciting, and thrilling. It is very similar to the book series \"Alex Rider\". This is the 4th book of the \"Young Bond\" series, and is my favorite.The book takes place all in Mexico. James is taking a break off of school, and is in Mexico to spend his time. Although, a huge, massive, severe storm is coming it's way throughout Mexico. James's guide, Garcia, knows Mr. Stone, where James can stay at during the storm. As James is at the Stones' house, he meets Mr. Stone's daughter, Precious, who has quite the mouth. James was with his Aunt Chiarman, and his aunt needs to be flown to a jungle expedition, and Mr. Stone, who is very rich, has a plane. James is stuck with Precious, and her little brother JJ, as Mr. Stone is flying Aunt Chiarman somewhere, before a massive storm. During the storm, however, a Mexican gang breaks into the house, and captures all the servants, even Precious and JJ. James is the only one who hasn't been captured. In time, James, Precious, and JJ, escape. Stranded with nowhere to go, their house destroyed and the gang gone, they find a way to survive, but soon meet again with the same gang. James is dressed as a Mexican, although. As the kids have to go through the risks and dangers the gang brings them, they find a way out of it, leading them to the most dangerous place in all of Mexico.

The premise sounded cool and a Young James Bond sounds totally awesome, loads better than he is as an adult. But I was wrong...From the very beginning, I realized that the plot would not take the natural turns I thought it would take. The author wrote a verrrry unnecessary \"prologue\", which introduces the villain, the settings, etc. And as I'm taking all this in, I'm thinking, why should I care?. Not a very good way to draw your readers in, if you ask me. I mean, I understood as the plot developed, but I don't like it when I'm given seemingly unnecessary details in the beginning. It being an action book I assumed it would be action first, explaining later. The author's formula still worked, but it really dragged.After the painfully long, aforesaid intro, James Bond finally comes into the story. Okay, things are looking up right now. Wrong again. Once the conflict starts, it's exciting for awhile, but then loses steam. I'll tell you why: 1) The main part of the book follows our protagonist on a rather long, rather boring, rather confusing road trip all across Mexico. Most of the time, I forgot the name of the the characters' locations. That's how fast they moved around. 2) James Bond didn't come into any conflict at all with the main villain until the last third of the book. Didn't the author know he was going in the wrong direction?I gave it one more star than I would have, because I could tell the author was really trying to deliver the story.
