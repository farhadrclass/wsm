It\u2019s kind of . . .\u201d then she paused and we both were awkwardly silent for a minute. \u201cWell, I was going to say, it\u2019s kind of like us, a little bit, but not \u2013\u201c\u201cYeah,\u201d I said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to say it \u2013 because not all of it \u2013 \u201c\u201cYeah, not all of it.\u201dWe didn\u2019t talk about it again. When I first saw this book, I think I died a little inside because of the cover. I didn\u2019t hate The Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood like I hated The Mermaid Chair or (*shudder*) Bastard out of Carolina, but when there\u2019s a little girl on the cover of a book, looking all innocent, it\u2019s like a movie with the word \u201cEducation\u201d in the title. You just know you\u2019re in for a published trip to the psychiatrist\u2019s couch. Kiddy-sex and soul-searching. I\u2019m not saying people shouldn\u2019t tell their stories (I mean, look at me, I\u2019m all up in your website telling my stories), but I do think people should get a handle on what their story is before they try to tell it. Or at least before they make me read it. Sorry, that\u2019s kind of asshole-ish of me to say, but I just think a lot of books with innocent little girls on the cover are really arrogant. They have this sense that since some man did something horrifying, everything that women do, including dancing around a fire with girlfriends or taking exotic lovers, is just part of the loving circle of nature\u2019s healing. I am such a fan of women, and so I take it personally when we look like morons. This book has absolutely nothing in common with its cover. I haven\u2019t written a review of it before because I think it is a perfect book, and how do you review a perfect book? I\u2019m like Wayne and Garth when they meet Alice Cooper. This book is my Alice Cooper. I\u2019m sure it wouldn\u2019t be everyone\u2019s Alice Cooper, but to me this is exactly what a book should be. Everything about the book is simple, concise, and action-packed. It makes me laugh and it makes me cry. The people are incredible, but deep and smart and human. In some ways, I think this book is the Great American Story, but it\u2019s the story none of us talk about and all of us live. In other ways, the book is so specific and personal to the Walls family that I never would have imagined the stories if I had not been told them. Virginia Woolf and Rainer Maria Rilke, two of the wisest people I have read, both ask when and how women will be able to tell stories without being self-conscious that they are women. How can we write, or even live, not as reactions to men, but as separate masters of our own experiences? I don\u2019t know where the genders are on the space/time continuum of respecting each other, and I think there are probably gender-related specifics to any story (maybe that\u2019s just natural and not even bad), but there is something about this book that is just human and strong. It is compassionate and unflinching. Oh, I hate adjectives. Just, read the first chapter of this book, and if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s compelling, don\u2019t keep reading because it\u2019s probably not for you. My family was nomadic, like Jeannette Walls\u2019s family, but, like I say, all of her stories, and my stories, are unique. When I last lived with my parents, it struck me that we never really understand other people\u2019s relationships with each other. I grew up, probably as many of us did, thinking that my parents never really got along and that my mom was a victim of my dad\u2019s anger and wild scheming. But, later, I realized they probably both got something that I never understood out of their relationship. I think a lot of this book is about how we know the people we are close to and, also, never really do \u2013 how it is useless to hold other people to our own standards of what love or responsibility looks like. But, still, it is about holding each other responsible. Or, maybe the book is just about her family with no real moral lesson at all. Walls is so loyal to her stories in an almost scientific way. None of the adult outrage that contaminates so many stories of children creeps into Walls\u2019s. She tells you what happened, and maybe how she felt about it at the time, but she doesn\u2019t impose emotion on the reader. Here\u2019s just a small part (well, actually, half . . . I couldn\u2019t resist) of the first chapter to give you a little taste:Mom was sitting at a booth, studying the menu, when I arrived. She\u2019d made an effort to fix herself up. She wore a bulky gray sweater with only a few light stains, and black leather men\u2019s shoes. She\u2019d washed her face, but her neck and temples were still dark with grime.She waved enthusiastically when she saw me. \u201cIt\u2019s my baby girl!\u201d she called out. I kissed her cheek. Mom had dumped all the plastic packets of soy sauce and duck sauce and hot-and-spicy mustard from the table into her purse. Now she emptied a wooden bowl of dried noodles into it as well. \u201cA little snack for later on,\u201d she explained.We ordered. Mom chose the Seafood Delight. \u201cYou know how I love my seafood,\u201d she said.She started talking about Picasso. She\u2019d seen a retrospective of his work and decided he was hugely overrated. All the cubist stuff was gimmicky, as far as she was concerned. He hadn\u2019t really done anything worthwhile after his Rose Period.\u201cI\u2019m worried about you,\u201d I said. \u201cTell me what I can do to help.\u201dHer smile faded. \u201cWhat makes you think I need your help?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not rich,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I have some money. Tell me what it is you need.\u201dShe thought for a moment. \u201cI could use an electrolysis treatment.\u201d\u201cBe serious.\u201d\u201cI am serious. If a woman looks good, she feels good.\u201d\u201cCome on, Mom.\u201d I felt my shoulders tightening up, the way they invariably did during these conversations. \u201cI\u2019m talking about something that could help you change your life, make it better.\u201d\u201cYou want to help me change my life?\u201d Mom asked. \u201cI\u2019m fine. You\u2019re the one who needs help. Your values are all confused.\u201d\u201cMom, I saw you picking through trash in the East Village a few days ago.\u201d\u201cWell, people in this country are too wasteful. It\u2019s my way of recycling.\u201d She took a bite of her Seafood Delight. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say hello?\u201d\u201cI was too ashamed, Mom. I hid.\u201dMom pointed her chopsticks at me. \u201cYou see?\u201d she said. \u201cRight there. That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying. You\u2019re way too easily embarrassed. Your father and I are who we are. Accept it.\u201d\u201cAnd what am I supposed to tell people about my parents?\u201d\u201cJust tell the truth,\u201d Mom said. \u201cThat\u2019s simple enough.\u201dIt\u2019s been a while since I read this book, so a lot of the stories aren\u2019t fresh in my mind, but some are so vivid to me that I think of them whenever I see a trash can or think of the desert. In high school, I thought that American history was the most boring topic imaginable. Then, in college, I took a class called the History of Women in the U.S., and I realized that I think the history of industry and conquest is mind-numbing, but the history of actual people is riveting. The Glass Castle is a real, honest history (or as honest as histories can be) of people in America. It is so close to me and so foreign in just the way this country is. It is also, in a way, a tribute to family oral histories. My dad has a . . . loose . . . relationship with the truth, as I\u2019ve probably mentioned on this site before. In the past couple of years, every time I see one of my siblings, we sit around and tell stories from my dad or about my dad, trying to weed out what actually happened, what got a nice polish in the story factory, and what is an outright lie. I get that same feeling from this book \u2013 of siblings sitting around and saying, \u201cDo you remember . . .\u201d and \u201cYou weren\u2019t there this one time . . .\u201d or \u201cNo, that\u2019s just what Dad said happened, what actually happened was . . .\u201d I\u2019m sure someday, my siblings and I will put together a history of our own, since every one of us seems to have inherited the storytelling gene. Whatever I write will be in some way inspired by this book."}, {"userName": "Emily May", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may", "userReview": "Now I get why people like this memoir so much.Though it is a memoir and a true story, both the writing style and the way Walls reminisces about her childhood make it seem like more of a fairy tale. My favourite non-fiction books are those that don't lose the compelling flow of a good fiction book - that still pull you into another world and life, dragging you along for the ride. This is one of those.I especially liked reading about Walls' complex and conflicting thoughts about her parents and childhood. When she's writing about her youth, she writes with the rose-tinted glasses of a young girl who loves her family; as she grows, she begins to see the shadows of reality creeping in - her father's alcoholism, her mother's selfish behaviour, the lack of food in the cupboards as a parental failure and not a normality. And, through it all, she still loves her parents. She remembers her father as an intelligent man full of fantastical stories, and her mother as a spirited artist. It's interesting, though, how differently I felt toward them. Normally, a convincing story has me feeling the same way as the narrator, but even though I could understand Walls's love for her parents, I despised them for being selfish and neglectful. I hated them for allowing a 3 year old to use the stove (and cause herself serious burns). I felt extreme anger, not love and understanding, towards them.But that's not a criticism. The Glass Castle is a beautifully-written, emotional read. A true bildungsroman, full of dark and happy times.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store"}, {"userName": "Elyse", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse", "userReview": "Another Update: I just saw the movie!!! I liked it! Woody Harrelson - Brie Larsonand Naomi Watts were all great! I thought they got the important 'duel' emotions just right. On one end - the parents did not 'protect' their kids appropriately at all-- lots of crazy dangerous chaos- On the other end - there was no question the parents loved wholeheartedly their children AND there were 'some' great gifts they gave their children - so our emotions are 'mixed'. At the end of the movie when they show the real -Jeanette Walls & her mom- plus wonderful photos of the kids growing up... it's very touching? Update: I just read some place that a movie is being made of this book. I want to share something about my relationship with \"The Glass Castle\" --that I've shared with a few people on this site --but never with the larger community. I read this book in 2006. It was a gift from a friend. She mailed it to me from New York. She said...\"YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK\". The book had only been out about a week. I wasn't much of a reader.My friend knew me well --knew about my childhood --and said ....\"you 'will' read this book\".Paul and I were leaving for Harbin Hot Springs --a regular -'get-a-way' place for us at the time. I took \"The Glass Castle\" with me. I mentioned in my other 'little' review --that I read it while sitting under a tree. The author became my hero! What I 'didn't' say was .....\"I then read another book, right away\"! I liked it too! Then another book... Then another! I HAD *NOT* BEEN A READER UNTIL THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!I'm not saying this was the best book in the entire world -(but it was great),- but I'm saying 'something' happened to me. I have been reading book-after-book -after -book (never NOT reading a book) --since 2006!!!Looking back, I'm 'thankful' the following few books were all good experiences. Had they been awful books....I might not have kept reading. Having several good books under my belt, if I hit a book I didn't like later on, --I didn't worry any longer. I knew reading was enjoyable. I felt comfort in ways I couldn't explain. I wanted to call my long time friend 'reader' friends from Jr. High School (Lisi, Renee, Ron) ---friends who were always reading --and say.....\"why didn't you tell me\"? \"why didn't you tell me how intimate -personal - WONDERFUL - READING WAS? ------Now, as an adult, I was not reading for a class....or a grade. I wasn't reading to please anyone!!!!I'm still clear I have holes in my education.

I can relate to many of the lessons she learned, and as such, I never had an issue believing her. These things can and do happen. The system fails children, and addicts (whether they're addicted to alcohol or excitement) will seek their fix above all else. As long as the addiction is in the picture, the person just doesn't exist. Children in alcoholic families eventually become aware of this, and the sooner they \"get it\" the better for them. In the book, this is nowhere more clearly evidenced than in the case of Walls' youngest sister, who spent the least amount of time in the presence of her parents dysfunction, and yet was finally the most crippled of all the children.Of course, I admit, I have a firmly-seated belief that the strongest and most creative of personalities are forged in fire; Maureen just didn't get burned enough to see the necessity of making a different life for herself. That, and she was separated from her other siblings by so many years that they took care of her more than they tried to include her in their effort to survive.I loved this book. Walls' short (but revealing) scenes were detail and character-driven, and there were several times I caught myself chuckling at some absolute absurdity or marveling at an unexpected bit of wisdom from someone who should have been a totally unreliable source. And I guess that's one of the main things I came away with after reading this book. Wisdom can come from anyone...whether we like them or not. And the trick to surviving is to take those things that make us better and stronger with us, and to leave the rest behind."}, {"userName": "Lola  Reviewer", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14596170-lola-reviewer", "userReview": "This story is proof that there are books out there that can change the way you look at the world...

Walls begins the book by explaining what has prompted her to write about her family: after she has \"made it\" and become a successful writer living in New York, she comes across her mother picking trash out of a dumpster and, in shame, slinks down in her taxi seat and pretends not to see or know her. Later, Walls confronts her mother, asking what she is supposed to tell people about her parents, and her mother replies, \"Just tell the truth. That\u2019s simple enough.\"Of course, \"The Glass Castle\" is anything but simple, as Walls attempts to come to terms with her upbringing. The first third of the memoir deals with her young childhood on the west coast, as her parents live as nomads, moving frequently between desert towns, always seeking the next adventure. Walls' mother is the key figure we meet here: an artist and a writer, she seems to live in her own world and doesn't express much concern in the practical realities of raising her children. In a key passage, Walls' mother takes the kids with her to give them art lessons, as she paints and studies the Joshua tree. Walls tells her mother of her plan to dig up the tree, replant it, and protect it so it can go straight. Walls' mother admonishes her, \"You'd be destroying what makes it special. It's the Joshua tree's struggle that gives its beauty.\" This appears to be Walls' mother's philosophy of life \u2013 looking for the next struggle \u2013 as the family willingly gives up its nice residence in Phoenix that Walls' mother had inherited from her family to move to the father's home town \u2013 a depressed coal town in West Virginia.The family's time in West Virginia makes up the next third of the story and depicts a depressed life in a depressed town. It is in West Virginia where the family seems to drift apart, particularly Walls' father, who up to this point, had been worshipped and revered by his daughter. Like Walls' mom, her dad has a lot of imagination; while he takes odd jobs that never last long, his real dream is to strike it rich with one of his inventions. He promises, once he has found his gold, that he is going to build a \"glass castle\" \u2013 his most special project \u2013 a great big house for the family to live in. Once in West Virginia, Walls and her brother figure they will make the best of the situation, and they spend a month digging a hole in the ground to serve as the foundation for the glass castle. But because the family can't pay for trash collection, their father instructs them instead to use the hole for the family's garbage. Although she has always been her father's defender, Walls grows disillusioned with her father, eventually telling him he will never build the glass castle.Determined not to end up like her parents, Walls moves to New York, where the last third of the book transpires. It is here that Walls \"makes it,\" graduating from college, gaining employment as a writer, marrying a rich husband, and settling into a Park Avenue apartment. Interestingly, while Walls has rejected her parents' lifestyle, it is now their turn to reject hers. Her father refuses to visit the Park Avenue apartment, while her mother, after visiting the apartment, asks Walls, \"Where are the values I raised you with?\" At this point, it is a mystery what values Walls actually possesses. By crafting the memoir around stories of her childhood, we as readers are often troubled, not just because of the content of the stories but because the stories don't provide much in the way of reflection or introspection. It is, in fact, unclear what Walls actually does value \u2013 will she continue to identify success with the material trappings of her \"normal\" life in New York, or will she ultimately reject the conventional life, as her parents did? Without more reflection from Walls, particularly in this concluding section of the book, readers are left to their own interpretation of \"the truth\" about her parents \u2013 are they just a drunk father and a lazy mother, or is there something more to it? The \"Glass Castle\" is an addicting page-turner that should captivate any reader. However, without this reflection and introspection from Walls about her childhood, the book misses an opportunity to make a more lasting impact on readers and ultimately fails to reach the level of a work like \"Angela\u2019s Ashes.\" In the end, it is up to readers to make up their own minds about \"the truth\" of Walls' parents and her upbringing and what it all means. I chose to discount some of her parents' flaws and instead read this book as an homage to her parents. To me, the key passage in the book is when Walls visits a classmate's home in West Virginia and sees the empty walls in the house (in stark contrast to her own home, which is cluttered with paintings and books and decorations) and rejects the notion that her classmate's father, passed out on the couch, bares any resemblance to her own father. After Walls recounts the story to her family, her mother replies that she should show compassion for her classmate because not everybody has \"all the advantages you kids do.\" Although the statement is ironic on its face, as the family fights over the crumbs of a chocolate bar, the distinction is clear: Walls' family may not provide her with much in the way of tangible goods, but they give her things that are more lasting \u2013 a belief in herself, a passion for reading and writing, an appreciation for things a lot of us take for granted, and most of all love. In the end, it was not important whether her parents actually built her a glass castle. It was that they gave her the idea of a glass castle. By overcoming her shame for her parents and writing this memoir, Walls seems to recognize this truth about her parents \u2013 that, like the Joshua tree, there was beauty in their struggle."}, {"userName": "Matthew", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16254355-matthew", "userReview": "Who here has seen the show Shameless?

Frank Gallagher and Rex Walls are the same guy!I enjoyed all the vignettes from Jeannette Walls' life. She did a great job throwing them all together to create a story even without a specific plot. I am not sure that any of the stories lasted more than a few pages, but each one of them was interesting and important in its own way.I listened to the book and it was great because it was was read by the author. I think that this is how all audio memoirs should be. Also, I thought it was interesting that although some of the stories made me want to reach through the speaker and shake her parents, she told the story without any positive or negative inflection. It was like she was saying, \"here is my story, you decide how you want to be affected by it.\"I believe that most people will enjoy this book. Some might be frustrated.

If she had been bitter in her description it would not have been believable, but instead it was tinged with forgiveness making me respect her for not only surviving such a strange childhood to become a successful, even functioning, adult but for being able to view her past with impartiality. What was thought-provoking for me was the idea that if you think you're a victim you are and if you don't you're not. As appalling as her mother's reaction was to her troubles, it's true. We do overprotect our children at the price of their own growth sometimes. And in this society we are on the jumpy side when it comes to misconduct, but telling someone they have been victimized isn't always best for them. It's not empowering. We've gone so much to the other extreme that it was good to reconsider a sway more toward center. There has to be a medium where we aren't making children grow up as toddlers but also not sheltering them from making their own decisions until their adults.There are also a lot of class \"poor\" mentalities in the book. The way the family never planned for the future as in aimed to use any gift or income to exponentially improve their lives, but horded means until they ran out. They tore down what they had until it ran out. They lived day to day. They took advantage when they could. The old adage that you give a man a fish he'll eat for a day but teach him to fish and he'll eat for a lifetime is moot. They were not concerned with bettering their station in life only getting all they could out of it today.I found it strange that both parents were so highly intelligent and capable and yet they chose to be homeless. It bothered me that they thought the best existence would be to throw their burdens on society and let it care for them without realizing, or caring, that someone was paying and working for their existence. It bothered me that they didn't think of their children's welfare above their own but used them like they would any other member of society. At times I found my blood boiling at the actions of her parents. That's what dysfunction will do to you.And yet, she presents the incidents without anger or hurt. It happened. It shaped her glasses of the world. But the past isn't a happy place to live. She took what good she could from her experience (or bad to learn from) and moved determinedly from a childhood she didn't enjoy into an adulthood she could pick. And that's what a memoir should do: show us the past to affect the future, not to give us a place to live."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62149-kate", "userReview": "This book really made me angry--why can people who have absolutely no business having kids be able to have four?Let me backtrack...In the beginning, the Walls family is always on the run. The father is an alcoholic, who is intelligent, but believes everything upon everything is a conspiracy. He can't get a job because of the mafia, the government, the gestapo...The mother has a teaching degree, but chooses to be an artist. The family is barely able to scrape by; the father spends any money they have on alcohol, the kids barely eat, and all this time, the mother sits around, doing nothing but reading. In fact, at one point, the 12 year old narrator Jeannette tells her mother that she needs to get a job, and her mother says that it's \"not fair\" that she has to work. Later, when Jeannette suggests that her mother get a job and home with a wealthy family and take care of the kids, her mother says, \"I've spent my whole life taking care of people! I just want to take care of me.\"Perhaps now you can see why this book made me so angry. I know that there are people like Jeannette's parents who feed their children margarine sandwiches and tell them to go to the bathroom in a bucket that is dumped outside because there's no indoor plumbing and the \"toilet\" is already completely filled. I know that these people exist, but I still can't believe it. A part of me was hoping that Walls pulled a James Frey and made a lot of this up, but another part of me realizes she probably didn't.Despite the knot in the pit of my stomach, I enjoyed the book. After all, only a book this engaging and well-written could spark such a vivid and real response. It's a quick and easy read, and despite how angry I was for most of it, the book gave me hope that no matter how messed up a person's childhood is, he/she can still end up as a normal, productive part of society."}, {"userName": "Juliet", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/153010-juliet", "userReview": "Okay, I originally gave this one star but then had to go back and re-rate it to a two b/c I surprised a couple of you guys and in my impulsive way, I realized perhaps one star was a bit too knee jerk.It's not that I hated The Glass Castle, it's just that it irritated me with its self-conscious narrative style. Too much \"look at how horrible things were!\" and not enough detail or challenges to make me really care.The same stories are told and re-told throughout the memoir novel, and they rely too much on symbolism for my taste. I don't know how many times The Glass Castle is mentioned, but it was clear enough the first time we're told about it. Yes, I get it. Pretty shiny vulnerable fragile fortress - drunk father whose fantasies are selfish and unstable. Mother who's out to lunch. No money - just imaginations. Okay. Got it.Then, before we really have connected to any of the characters in their youth, we fast forward to today's NYC in which lo and behold, the storyteller is a successful writer. Gag.Basically, this book is a pale imitation of The Liar's Club. Karr's book is a jump off a cliff into a bravely realized memoir with enormous depth in the details, not to mention the writer's conflicted feelings about the meaning of father, of mother, of family, of self. By being so specific about her life and her family's life, Karr touches us deeply about family and self, too.Walls had an interesting life, but the story reads like someone else's family's trip.

I decided that my oldest son, who was then 14, should read it for \"Mom's Summer Reading Plan\" - also known as the Mom-Forces-Us-To-Read-For-Half-An-Hour-Each-Day-Torture-Program by certain members of the family. I felt it was important for him to learn that not every child gets to grow up in a household that has eight different video game systems. I wanted him to imagine what it would be like if his father came home one night and said \"We have to move right now. You can take ONE THING with you.\"Well, he grumbled and he whined. Then he shut up and started to read. He never said too much about the book, though he liked the part where the rat would come to eat out of the mother's big bowl of sugar. And then I saw on his Facebook profile that he had listed The Glass Castle as his favorite book.

I needed to finish this story. But! Mental illness is all around. This family is a perfect example, and also one of resilience. Hey, these children have more successful careers than I do! I always tell my kids that it takes all types to make the world go round. Jeannette Wells has crafted this memoir with passion and strength and devotion, but what blew me away most of all, there was not one shred of self pity packed into this. I know what I'm like in my little world, there is no way I could be this giving, NO WAY! I'm very interested in this amazing lady, I will find her books now and I so look forward to see how she's travelling. I could learn a thing or two, and that's what I'm always looking for. And she can write!!**Addendum: This was an amazing book that my favourite GR friend from the States recommended. I went to the library and got my copy. Months later I came across this book in my (unorganised double layered Ikea shelf thingy) book shelf, that I'd borrowed from my aunt in Queensland. It turns out all of her siblings had read it, making their own notes all over the book. This was a special book, I shouldn't have taken it with me.. But I'm so glad I got to return it. It turns out my aunt had had a similar childhood - I knew she'd struggled, but didn't realise to the extent. This book connection made me love my Aunty Donna even more.

I just have so little sympathy and empathy sometimes, especially in books, that this just IRKED me. Sure, the writing was well done, the prose effective, the story was a bit enchanting...I just could NOT understand why this book got such great reviews. In fact, the reviews is why I kept reading it. Had someone else thought it was CRAP I would have put it down without finishing. Walls whines and complains through the whole book about how difficult her childhood was, yet she was still able to be admitted to an IVY LEAGUE school. Ok, my childhood wasn't as bad as hers, I am bright, yet I hadn't the je ne se quoi to get into an Ivy league. Perhaps, the editor deleted a HUGE chapter in her memoir which would have filled the gap between living in a weatherproof shack and going to college, but it just didn't do it for me.

In \"The Glass Castle\" published in 2005 by Scribner, Walls reveals the intimate details of her upbringing within a dysfunctional yet loving family. \"The Glass Castle\" immediately grips you with an opening scene in which Walls, as an adult in New York City, sees from the window of her taxi her mother scrounging through a dumpster. Her mother is homeless \u2013 one of those bag ladies that all of us see \u2013 but now you suddenly have to wonder what it would feel like if that was your mother dangling at the fringe of our society. From this shocking moment, Walls transports you back to her earliest memory. She is three years old and suffers a terrible burn to her torso when her dress catches on fire as she is boiling hotdogs on the stove. A long stay at the local hospital near where her family is currently living in Arizona ensues while Walls recovers. To the hospital staff, the negligence of the parents is obvious, but Jeannette does not associate the murmuring disapproval around her with her parents.If any action on the part of social services is planned, we never find out because her father, Rex Walls, plans an early check out from the hospital in his trademark \"Rex Walls' style.\" This means that he will grab his little girl and skip out of the hospital bill that he has no intention or means of paying. Jeannette is whisked away with her father, mother, older sister and younger brother and the family hits the road. It begins just one of many journeys in which the Walls family ends up in ramshackle trailers and shacks throughout the deserts of Nevada, Arizona, and California. They stay someplace a while until Rex can't pay the rent or won't and they skip town and do it all over again. Rex inspired the title of the book with the plans, lovingly worked out on paper, for his \"glass castle\" that he aspires to build some day. He often reassures his children with the promise of this fanciful housing. It is to be a solar-powered house, but first he needs to raise the money to build it, which entails numerous gold prospecting schemes that are doomed to failure. Because gold-hunting never pays the bills, Rex also finds work as an electrician or handyman. He is smart and mechanically talented, but his earnings inevitably are washed away in the flash floods of drinking that perpetually leave his family destitute. In an engulfing narrative that sweeps you deeper into an almost unimaginable existence of privation, we see how Jeannette and her siblings cope with their destructively alcoholic father and beg their mother to function and get them food. The mother, in fact, has a teaching degree, but she rarely can drag herself into employability. Although the various rural areas where they live are always desperate for a qualified teacher, the mother cannot abide work and only occasionally holds down a job \u2013 with the help of her children who get her out of bed. The infrequent paychecks of the mother rarely go into the rumbling bellies of her children. Rex will invariably claim his wife's paycheck and set about squandering it. This desperate state goes on for years as the Walls children sleep in cardboard boxes instead of beds, endure scalding fights between their parents, and eat anything they can find. Their mother teaches them how to swallow spoiled food by holding their noses. But even amid these horrors of poverty and alcoholism, Jeannette Walls expresses the genuine love within her family. They are loyal to each other, and Rex, in his sober moments, is wise, encouraging, and tender with his children. In her memoir, Walls brilliantly crafts her experiences so that we can see the transformation of awareness that takes place as she grows up. As a little girl, she is uncritical of her parents. She loves them and does not realize how awfully deprived her life is. But as she and her siblings mature, they definitely realize that the shortcomings of their parents are not acceptable. The adolescent years of Jeannette are spent in West Virginia, where her father retreats to his hometown after going completely bust in Arizona. The life of the Walls in West Virginia is appalling as they occupy a shack at \"93 Little Hobart Street.\" The roof leaks. The plumbing does not work. The Walls family buries its trash and sewage in little holes it digs. They almost never have any food. Jeannette goes through high school digging leftover sandwiches out of the garbage, and Rex fills the role of town drunk. As miserable want defines their lives, Jeannette's mother does the most infuriating things. When Jeannette and her brother find a diamond ring, they immediately want to sell it for food, but their mother keeps it to \"improve her self esteem.\" And so they go on starving.As Jeannette Walls tells the story of her disgraceful upbringing, you will admire her perseverance and that of her siblings. The Walls children eventually take charge of their own lives and support each other into normal adult lives in a beautiful display of closeness among siblings.Every page of \"The Glass Castle\" will shock you with the shameless and selfish actions of parents who are unable and unwilling to even try to take care of their children or themselves. Despite her appalling parents, Walls rarely chastises them with her writing. Her love for her parents often comes through with aching dismay. Much more happens throughout this amazing memoir than has been mentioned here. \"The Glass Castle\" is mesmerizing and an impossible book to put down. It is truly a masterpiece of storytelling and far superior than the typical bestseller."}, {"userName": "Scot", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/663291-scot", "userReview": "I know many people love this book, remarking on how powerful and moving it was, but I had some deep problems with the narrator's memory process, and some issues about what lessons I was ultimately supposed to learn here. It is a riveting tale, full of unforgettable suffering, strife, and perseverance, about growing up with two bohemian-minded parents, one a raging alcoholic and the other a manic depressive. It is the story of the dangerous synergy that combination produced, and how the narrator and her siblings endured, withstood, and (well, some of them) triumphed. The film, when made, should do well at the box office. However, I am reminded of how a friend once explained Narcissism to me. \"Narcissists,\" he said, \"have to be the biggest Victims in the room and the strongest Heroes in the room--and they demand to be recognized as both at the same time.\" My problem is, I found the narrator to be narcissistic, and I stopped believing her version of all the events, especially after I came across a few factual references that totally seemed incorrect based on my own experience and knowledge. These were things someone who lived the experience would have known. (She certainly claims to have a vivid memory of a lot of things that happened when she was three years old, too!) Although doubtful of the veracity, I was compelled by the series of diverse settings, the odd mix of characters, and the ongoing unpredictable calamities to read on and see what happens, if anything, at the end."}, {"userName": "Madeleine", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1198255-madeleine", "userReview": "It's no secret that I get to read on the job. I proofread for a financial publisher, which means that I spend my days getting lost in the lilting legalese of prospectuses, trustee meeting results, shareholder reports, highlight sheets \u2013 it's riveting stuff, trust me. But we're a small operation with only a few clients and the fiscal schedule is defined by a feast-or-famine work flow: While the numbers are still being tabulated, portfolio managers are polishing their semiannual interviews and style redesigns are being approved before the work descends in avalanches, I\u2019m usually catching up on my reading with on-the-clock me-time.Since it\u2019s almost instinctive to dislike the person whose job it is scrutinize and correct everyone else\u2019s work (especially when said person has one of the few oh-so-coveted offices with a window overlooking the bucolic charm of two parking lots and a heavily traveled roadway), I have spent the better part of my three years there endearing myself to my coworkers to soften the blow when I literally cannot hack through a report because it\u2019s so choked with errors. My efforts have mostly paid off and a number of my mom-aged coworkers have grown rather maternal with me, as it\u2019s also not a secret that I stopped speaking to my parents more than two years ago.When a coworker recently came into my office brandishing an almost-finished book and saying that she kept thinking of me while reading this memoir she couldn\u2019t put down, I assumed she was referring to the way I always have my nose in some kind of reading material at work. And then a little bit of research revealed that \u201cThe Glass Castle\u201d was about growing up under the rule of parents who clearly had no business accepting the responsibility of parenthood, which was when I realized that this was my coworker\u2019s way of reaching out to me.A couple of days and maybe about 100 pages (and a lot of wincing because, holy crap, the Walls kids are tiny troopers) later, I got into a car accident during my commute home via a road that sees about seven or eight accidents a day, most of them during rush hour because it is a totally good idea to have a direct route to and from Philly narrow down to two lanes in one of the area\u2019s larger suburban oases. Long story short, I escaped the ordeal with my admittedly low expectations of humanity exceeded by miles. As I watched the tow-truck driver (who was totally cool with my nervous habit of asking a thousand rapid-fire questions as he drove both my car and me to the auto-body shop) load up my beloved, battered car with minimal fanfare, the last sigh of relief I heaved tasted something like \u201cAt least I don\u2019t have to explain this to my parents.\u201dThe thought resurfaced throughout the evening, like when my husband met me at the mechanic's and I just lost whatever composure I'd been faking when he was right there to help me out of the truck before pulling me into a bear hug. And later when my in-laws, who live right next door and treat me like the daughter they\u2019ve always wanted, greeted me with open arms, said that Mom\u2019s car was all ready for me whenever I was ready to go back to work (as they all but told me that I was going to stay home for a day or two) and reiterated that \u201cA car can be replaced but you can\u2019t\u201d every other sentence and meant it.By the time I was going fetal on my couch and started to feel the damage that a seat belt and steering wheel are capable of (which is surprisingly extensive when you\u2019re a small-statured, large-chested woman who always knew she\u2019d pay for leaning too far forward while driving), still marveling over how I received neither a single verbal evisceration nor a ticket after two of the most emotionally draining hours of my recent existence, I blurted some garbled admission to my husband about not knowing how to stop expecting someone to punish me, which is about when I realized that I\u2019ve spent my adult life bracing myself to be torn down for every misstep as if the fate of the universe relied on me not fucking up, which isn\u2019t entirely unlike the way my parents reacted to the staggering majority of the things that came naturally to me. I called out of work for two days not because my boobs were bleeding (they were) or because it hurt to move my neck (it did) or because pulling open doors made me feel like my chest was on fire (holy crap, did it ever), though my collection of minor injuries eased the terminally itchy conscience that won't even be appeased by having a valid excuse for calling out and leaving other people to pick up my slack unless I accept a load of Catholic-sized guilt in exchange lest I give myself a few justifiable recovery days without the appropriate reciprocal suffering. I needed some time to consider how much an inherently lousy experience opened my eyes to damage I didn\u2019t even know I was still carrying around (what the hell, surely talking about going to therapy is just as good as actually going, right?). My coping method of choice? Alternately napping like a champ and juggling three books, including this memoir of the girl who was born to a bitterly brilliant drunk she idolized and an indifferent, self-involved artist who she tried so hard to understand, only to become the person she was meant to be with little support from the two people who should have been there to cheer her on all the way. Like I\u2019d said, I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be unbiased in how I approached Jeannette Walls\u2019s coming-of-age story: No matter how sympathetically she painted her parents (which she did quite well), I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to stop myself from resenting them for failing their children. But then the little-girl hero worship Jeanette felt for her tortured, misunderstood genius of her father just struck every raw nerve I have and just poked and poked until I had to physically distance myself from the book. The killer was that I\u2019d stew in whatever calamity last befell these children to the point of needing to know how things were resolved (or avoided entirely). It's distracting to be doing other things and thinking about the book you'd rather be reading. Not even the blatantly narcissistic ravings of Jeannette\u2019s mother sounded enough alarms to keep me from venturing back to this book if I\u2019d stray too far for too long. And I\u2019d\u2019ve thrown the book across the room at Mrs. Walls\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m not crying because you\u2019re leaving me for New York City; I\u2019m crying because you\u2019re going and I\u2019m not!\u201d outburst had I not already been forced to corral all my determination to return this borrowed book in acceptable condition after Mama W -- whose \u201cOh, I don\u2019t believe in discipline because children need to learn their own lessons\u201d philosophy barely disguised the maternal disinterest and selfish absence that I know all too well \u2013 wailed that she has sacrificed so much for her children when the scamps had demonstrated time and again that they\u2019re more responsible for their family than the matriarch is. I, uh, may have transferred a lot of my own lingering anger at my emotionally damaging mother onto Mrs. Walls, which makes me question how justified my screaming dislike of her is. The less said about Papa Walls, the better. My father might not have been a hopeless drunk but I kind of wish he had some kind of excuse for routinely breaking promises to the children who thought the sun rose and set on him. An absent mother is easy to hate while growing up and even easier to pity once you\u2019ve come of age. That simpering animosity is something you get used to after a while and, if you\u2019re like Jeannette and a better person than I am, you simply accept that your self-involved mother has constructed such an elaborate alternate reality around herself that nothing real can get through to her if she doesn\u2019t want it to, that she can even turn homelessness into an enviable adventure. But an idolized father\u2019s fall from grace? The older you get, the harder it is when you finally realize the one person you\u2019ve told yourself can do anything is the person who's let you down with the least remorse. That first hard look at how helpless and broken the man behind the curtain is.... that is not easy to come back from. That\u2019s how little girls grow up to become giant messes.When Jeannette found her way to the school paper and sampled her first taste of print journalism's sweet, sweet escapist nectar.... oh, my heart went out to her younger self in eagerly over-earnest ways. Being a half-consumed whiskey bottle rolling around an otherwise empty desk away from calling herself a true-blooded journalist at such a young age would have won me over if the entire book preceding such a moment hadn't already made me want to see Jeannette find her place in the world. Newsroom nostalgia will always be the easiest way to my too-soft heart.I am amazed that this isn\u2019t one of those \u201cOh my God, so let me tell you about my super-sad story so you\u2019ll feel just awful about the craptastic childhood I had and then you\u2019ll be totally amazed at how far I\u2019ve come and how functional I am hey, why don\u2019t you love me yet please love me and feel sorry for me I need your sympathy give it to me\u201d memoirs, thank bouncing Baby Jesus. It\u2019s a documentation of these things that happened to the four Walls children and how at least three of them embraced responsible independence and sibling camaraderie. Walls describes what she sees, reporting the facts and supplying exposition as needed like any good journalist. Also like a good journalist, emotions get minimal face time here. Jeannette is the perfect narrator because it seems as though she is the most willing to accept her parents for what they are. Even though I selfishly wanted to know how her adult self dealt with the fallout of her turbulent childhood (because every little adult grows up to be a big child, let's be honest), I found myself admiring how Jeannette was in no way reliant on cheap feelings to maneuver the story to its conclusion. Jeannette and her siblings are the heroes of this story. They get themselves out of a bad situation one by one, fishing out each younger sibling as the means become available. Because what\u2019s a better introduction to a new life of stability after years of only knowing that what comes next is an obstacle you can rely on exactly yourself and your equally young siblings to overcome?Christ, I still have two more reviews to catch up on and a stack of pumpkin pancakes that are clearly not going to eat themselves (unless they plan to fight me for the privilege). In short, this book was fucking great but it struck far too close to home in ways I may have overly personalized. It didn't make me laugh like it did my coworker but it sure as hell did make me appreciate how Jeannette Walls turned out. I've had a lot of people recently and unknowingly demonstrate that humanity might not be as awful as I've always thought it to be, and witnessing a grown child forgive her parents for their many crimes against her certainly made for the kind of book that confirmed it's probably time to fix my perspective. Maybe we're not as fucked of a species as I've feared all along."}, {"userName": "Cheri", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106692-cheri", "userReview": "\u201cWe take a chance from time to timeAnd put our necks out on the lineAnd you have broken every promise that we madeAnd I have loved you anyway\u201d\n-- \u201cLike a Fool\u201d - Keira Knightley/ Lyrics - John Carney/\u201cBegin Again\u201d Soundtrack Dysfunction and crushing poverty are at the heart of this memoir, but love is there, as well.

How difficult it must be to share such intimate details with the world and then sit back while they judge not only you based on your life, but also the people that you loved, love, despite themselves, despite the things they did or did not do. Nothing about this memoir seeks pity, or condemnation of those who raised her, or even of the way she was raised, it just is the way it was, and now her life is different. Her rags-to-riches story takes her from Arizona to California to Welch, West Virginia, and eventually to New York City. My father shared some of his stories with me about growing up poor in West Virginia, hours away from Welch, in another part of the state where there are also few economic options. Preacher, professor, farmer, the railroad, or by the time my father was old enough to think of a future, for just a few - a pilot. I would say he never looked back once he left, but the truth is he was friends with many from that small town until the day he died. Having been there, having heard his stories, stories of his friends growing up there, it was easy for me to envision these places she lived, the people. Jeannette Wells has walked deep into her past in this memoir, her younger years were less than wonderful and yet she survived, flourished even, maybe. Certainly there must be scars of a childhood where neglect and hunger are so prevalent, where alcohol is more important than food, where clothing and shoes and shelter take back seat to liquor and chocolate bars. Parents are supposed to be the guardians of those too young to care for themselves, but frequently the children were left to fend for themselves or care for the parents. There are so many moments in this memoir that are horrifying, and she has both the physical and emotional scars from those years. And yet, what really shines through is the compassion and love she still feels after all was said and done.\n\u201cWe finally find thisThen you're goneBeen chasin' rainbows all alongAnd you have cursed meWhen there's no one left to blameAnd I have loved you just the same\u201d\n -- \u201cLike a Fool\u201d \u2013 Keira Knightley / Lyrics by John Carney / \u201cBegin Again\u201d SoundtrackRecommended"}, {"userName": "Marcie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/773811-marcie", "userReview": "Once I let my frustration with the parents' neglect go, I actually enjoyed this book. Because of her matter-of-fact, non-whining writing, I enjoyed reading this book the entire time and actually put off other things so I could read more. As a disclaimer to my following comments, I am in no way condoning all of their parenting style and I also acknowledge they did not provide for their children like a parent should, but I have to say that I learned quite a bit from her parents! The positive things from this book stuck with me, not the negative ones, so that is what my comments will be about.  The description of her growing up years gave me ideas and motivation of how to be passionate about hobbies and life in general. Her parents taught me how to make learning fun and to see the potential in people and situations (i.e.\"this house needs fixing, but it has good bones\"). I went away from this book with a desire to have more vigor and creativity in life and to pass that on to my children (i.e. the mom bought tons of shoes from thrift stores and played classical/jazz/country/etc. music and they danced around having a ball while learning all about different genres of music).  I also feel that we've become too much of \"helicopter\" parents -- hovering over our children making sure we direct every thought and action they have. We see this as helping, but I think it is actually detrimental to their own learning and growth. We are seeing the effects of dependent, inexperienced college-aged kids (this was most notable in southern CA). I think many of life's lessons could and should be learned at home, which means a loosening of the reins so that mistakes are still made while we are around to help as parents. Granted, in the book, her parents take this self-learning to an extreme, but I still learned from it. My perception is that (the US) society labels you as a \"bad parent\" if your child is allowed to 1)fall off a slide at the playground, 2)go without their snack one day at school if they forgot it(vs. you bringing it to them), 3) sort out a (non-physical) fight they got in with a friend without a parent getting involved, etc. I also found it amusing that she had such hard time accepting that her mom wanted to be homeless. I can understand how she'd still be embarrased or get tired of having to explain to people, but I agreed with her mom when she said that her daughter had the problem with esteem because she still worried about what other people thought. Anyway, it got me thinking so much about what's most important in life and how important love is (I never once doubted her parents love for her and she gave the impression that she never did either) that I highly recommend it! I had a couple friends that didn't like it, mostly because they couldn't get past things like her digging in trash cans at school because she was so hungry('People like that shouldn't be allowed to have kids' they said).

I LOVED this book! I wish I had had non stop uninterrupted hours to devour this book but I also didn't want it to end. I loved the family dynamics. What a unique bunch of people! The writing is simple and incredibly accessible so you felt really at home reading along. I actually had times where I felt envious of this nomadic carefree life that it had me rethinking my life of conventional suburban living. Made me think what a sheltered (boring?) life I've led lol. I love a book that takes me out of my comfort zone and gives me a unique and different perspective on life. It's about a family who turn being poor (and boy I mean POOR!) and spin it into an adventure, they stick to their own values and don't care about conventions and fitting in. Although the parents are incredibly flawed many times clearly negligent, you also believed they loved each other immensely. The mum always optimistic and seeing the sunny side of life under the worst conditions was borderline psychotic not to mention criminal but still I loved all her crazy antics. The father always running away so he avoids paying bills and running from bad debts always doing the skedaddle made me laugh out loud many times. This was sad, funny (so funny!!) disturbing and a heck of a fun entertaining book full of whacky and colourful characters that you soon won't forget. I was amazed at the author's positive determination and resilience, she hardly ever had a bad word to say about her family other than to describe the scene. She never allowed her situation to dampen her outlook on life if anything it made her a more compassionate human being. What an admirable lady who deserves every success in life, she really is the definition of a rags to riches story and I loved every moment of this book. One of my favourite memoirs of all time!"}, {"userName": "Dem", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2752994-dem", "userReview": "An extraordinary account of Parental neglect to the point of where I kept asking myself....could All this have possibably happened in one family? I first read this book back in 2009 and didnt even write a review as I found the book depressing and relentless. This time it was nominated for my sit in book club and when the nomination was announced  THE GLASS CASTLE I took a deep breath, gritted my teeth, smiled and thought Ok might just pretend I read again and wing it when it comes to discussion night. But my friend who knew my dislike of the book encouraged me to read it as but this time as a BOOKCLUB READ with the discussion questions in mind and perhaps I may get more from the book second time around.While reading this book I thought about my own family get-togethers and stories that would get told from our childhood days and while I remember very little to the point where I often asked \" are ye sure I belong to the same family\"? As I seem to remember so little and this is where I am amazed at how much the author remembers from her childhood. \nHaving said that if my childhood was eventful and full of as many odd characters as Jeanettes then perhaps my memory would serve me better.\nAnd while my initial thoughts still remain I did mange to get more from the book, as this time I found the humor and the hope and while I do think perhaps many of the situations are a little embellished for the good of the story there is no doubt the Walls as kids saw some rough times and their parents really were in a league of their own when it came to parenting. How you come through a life like this and come out the otherside a well rounded and capable person really does say alot about this family.  Overall I found this an interesting read and there are funny passages and moments throughout the story which second time around seemed to come through better for me than the first and perhaps this is because second time around I knew these kids were going to make it and I could relax a little.Glad I took the time to read it again and looking forward to the discussion on this one."}, {"userName": "Ginger", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14097149-ginger", "userReview": "What a great, enduring story of survival! These kids are fighters!I\u2019m glad I read this memoir and that my real-life book club choose this for the month of November. It\u2019s one of the best memoirs that I\u2019ve read and I loved how the author, Jeannette Walls had a sense of peace about her parents by the end of the book. Kudos to her for not being bitter with how she was raised. Not many people could manage this with the type of conditions that she lived in.The parents were terrible, selfish and I hated them by the end of this book. I would get so sad and angry that they didn\u2019t take care of their kids. Their kids were starving, freezing and living in the worst possible conditions. The father was an alcoholic and the mother was a lazy, waste of space. They both took no responsibility for holding down a job or taking care of 4 children. This is a perfect example of the system failing and having addicts taking care of children. It\u2019s just not a formula for success. So with that said, it blows my mind that three of the four kids became successful and persevered. Well done Walls' kids!The writing was well done in this memoir. The book went in a well-defined pace and it was easy to read. If you\u2019re looking for a good memoir, check this one out. You will not be disappointed but likely pissed off by the time you've finished the book! Ha!"}, {"userName": "J.L.

It\u2019s no stretch to say Walls had an unconventional childhood. It\u2019s part adventure, part how do I live through this and make it to the next day. Walls\u2019 matter-of-fact tone makes an account of her childhood effective and keeps it focused on the events which both brought her family together as well as those which tore them apart. She is not a victim in this memoir. She doesn\u2019t ask for sympathy for herself and she doesn\u2019t blame her parents for how she was raised (much). In fact, she finds parts of her parents\u2019 behavior (when not bordering on outright neglect) admirable. Walls easily could have talked about any of several traumatic experiences and how she was scarred by them (and perhaps is still working through issues). If she had gone that route, The Glass Castle would have been a completely different book. Still, by the end of this memoir, the reader marvels at how Walls (as well as her siblings) escaped their parents while still maintaining a relationship with them.

Knowing what was coming down the track, this reading was even more satisfying, as I could slow down and savor her words instead of rushing ahead.I thought that everybody in the world had already read this but am in a new book club where my husband and I were the only ones lucky enough to have already done so. What a treat it was to revisit this after 10 years!Walls had a truly dysfunctional childhood, but knew that she was the apple of her alcoholic father's eye. The love from him, her siblings, and her own plucky self-determination certainly gave her a path through some very bizarre circumstances and into a successful adulthood. Having her father take her hand and stick it through the bars of a cheetah cage at the zoo and being instructed by her mother to simply cut off the maggot-loaded portions of unrefrigerated food and eat the portion that had not yet been touched, Walls learned wonder and pragmatism from her oddball parents.This book is loaded with anecdotes, one after another, full of amazing and horrifying and beautiful moments. As a parent myself, my loathing of the parents in the story climbed and climbed, but because this memoir was told from the perspective of Walls as a little girl first, I also fell in love with her mom and dad just a little bit. She narrates the tale in real time, and as she becomes a teenager with more open eyes, her disappointment in these parents becomes palpable.One could say that this is a rags to riches story, but the treasure was always there - despite the poverty, they were rich in the love they had for each other."}, {"userName": "Richard Derus", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3920693-richard-derus", "userReview": "MARCH 2017 UPDATE: There will be a film starring Brie Larson as Ms. Walls, Naomi Watts as her mother, and Woody Harrellson as her father, released at some as-yet unnannounced date in 2017.Rating: 4* of fiveThe Publisher Says: The Glass Castle is a remarkable memoir of resilience and redemption, and a revelatory look into a family at once deeply dysfunctional and uniquely vibrant. When sober, Jeannette's brilliant and charismatic father captured his children's imagination, teaching them physics, geology, and how to embrace life fearlessly. But when he drank, he was dishonest and destructive. Her mother was a free spirit who abhorred the idea of domesticity and didn't want the responsibility of raising a family.The Walls children learned to take care of themselves. They fed, clothed, and protected one another, and eventually found their way to New York. Their parents followed them, choosing to be homeless even as their children prospered.The Glass Castle is truly astonishing--a memoir permeated by the intense love of a peculiar but loyal family.My Review: Oh. My. God.Walls has a non-fiction novel coming out this month, so I decided to re-read the book that started all the ruckus before I got to Half-Broke Horses.A little backstory: I was romantically involved with a man for some time while I lived in Austin, whom I met on a bus. I got on the bus, sat a few seats behind the cute, sandy-haired, rumpled guy with the prominent ears I spotted from the pay-stile, and sighed the happy sigh of one whose world contains all the things he needs: A job, a home, and all the men he can mentally undress and ravish.I was mid-mental ravishment when Blondie upset the applecart by bursting into tears. As quietly as he could, of course, but tears. A stop later, still crying. Stop after that, still crying. I got up, moved into the seat next to him across the aisle, and said, \"What the hell're you reading? I wanna be sure I never set an eyeball on it.\" That got a laugh, and he held up The Glass Castle and said it was sort of the story of his life.We talked for four hours that day. I gave him my email and number, and things progressed pretty smoothly until August 2008, but that's another story.He'd just read Walls's tale of her father taking her pubescent self to a pool-hall and getting her within an inch of getting raped, just so he'd have beer money. It struck a chord, and the story of his own stepfather's abuses of Mr. Man came spewing out of him. I've read the book before just now, specifically so I could discuss it with Mr. Man, but I did so with an already numbed horror bone and a severed humor tendon.Only now that I am several years beyond that initial encounter with the book can I see how very funny the tragic events in it are, and were to the author. I can see that it's gallows humor of a sort...but also that it's all perfect proof that life's a Zen joke.If you can chuckle at Dolly Parton's apercu, \"You have no idea how much it costs to look this cheap,\" then Walls is the next step up the Sisyphean slope of learning how to laugh like the Dalai Lama. It's a hard life that etches grooves in the looking-glass, but it's a path worth taking if you can get to the place where \"textured\" is valued more than smooth. Read the book, you'll know what I mean."}, {"userName": "lkt", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/105031-lkt", "userReview": "From my Amazon.com review:\"Sometimes people get the lives they want...\" A stunning memoir, hard to put down. Walls is superb with details, a true genius. She is a fine example of a self-made, successful person. But throughout most of the book, I was so angry with the parents, her mother in particular: When the kids had nothing to eat, she hid a king-sized Hershey bar in her bed for herself. She had an excuse for her behavior, whining that she's a \"sugar addict.\" (And later, she refuses to get a job (or keep one, when she gets them) because she's an \"excitement addict.\" Really, it seems like she's rather immature and lazy. How exciting is it to sleep all day or have tantrums about blaming her children for her failures as an artist?) When Brian and Jeannette found the diamond ring, they could have used it to buy necessities like food and clothes, but their mother needed it for her precious self-esteem. She really lacks motivation to get up and do something about their deplorable living conditions, but is too selfish to do so. When Uncle Stanley groped Jeannette, he mother didn't seem too concerned and actually felt sorry for the uncle, believing him to be lonely! She refuses Welfare, despite the fact that her pride is harming her children, a form of child abuse and negligence. They are living in squalor but it's supposed to be an \"adventure.\" The house is filthy with the mold, trash, mushrooms growing in the corners, and the lack of heat and indoor plumbing. It is not an acceptable environment and I'm surprised the gov't man didn't come back. If you really love your children, you should provide for them, even if you hate charity. Instead, she spends most of her time feeling sorry for herself, if she isn't pursuing her true calling as an artist. And when she doesn't go back to one of her teaching jobs, she reasons, \"It's time I did something for myself..It's time I started living my life for me...Why do I have to earn the money? You [Jeannette] have a job.\" It just made me so angry to hear her talk that way to her own daughter. She has no sense of responsibility. \"I've got more important things to do,\" she also said. For all her artistic ideals, she is whiny, pathetic, seems to care more about strangers and stray animals than her children. And it was ridiculous how she didn't want to kill the flies and cockroaches, and felt sorry for the big rat in the sugar bowl. She is encouraging the unhealthy conditions by keeping pests alive, so it seems that while she doesn't want to deprive insects and animals of food (\"they need to eat too\"), it's ok if her children starve. And no, I'm not forgetting the father. I must admit that I had a soft spot for him, despite his alcoholism. He at least attempted to be a father, showing love to Jeannette and making her feel special,educating her on many subjects. I got teary when reading about how he read the same books on Jeannette's college reading lists so he could help her with any questions. He was more interested in her life than her mother was. But I was disgusted with Rex when he let the man at the bar take her upstairs. Definitely not a saint, but much more likeable than the mom in my view. I really admired Jeannette in the poli-sci class, when the prof is talking about the causes of homelessness. It cannot always be blamed on drugs and SS cuts - there is a degree of personal responsibilty, as I alluded to in the title of this review. As Jeannette said, \"If people worked hard and compromised...they could make ends meet.\" It angered the prof but I was proud of her. I wish she had told the truth about her background though. Yes, I'm hard on the parents, but they make me admire the author even more, for breaking free from the traps of her parents' self-made poverty. She never gave up, and I know that if I'd been in her shoes, I wouldn't have made it."}, {"userName": "Zoeytron", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12656534-zoeytron", "userReview": "An utterly fascinating look into the lives of two narcissists who neglect their children in order to serve their own ends.
