What makes this tired old tale fresh is the sense of community amongst chaos. In the middle of a broken world, one man, John Talon stops surviving and starts living. Delusions of grandeur? Perhaps, but I like the idea of mankind taking a stand and fighting back; a slight deviance to the traditional survival horror genre zombie books so comfortably fit in. Gory with a cause, White Flag of the Dead's true dread lies with ravenous gangs of survivors trying to squeeze as much anarchy as they can from a vastly dwindling human populace, making the zombies a welcome adversary. Like other genre books, there's plenty of action, violence, and suspense - add to that, a deeply emotional relationship between John and his baby son Jake and the hard man end of the world persona switches to loving father trying his best to make the world a better place. A nice touch and a theme I hope continues throughout the rest of the series.In 'White Flag of the Dead', Talluto has built a world on the brink of destruction with a glimmer of hope for revival populated by a strong cast that's far removed from the standard 2d cannon fodder of cheesy b-list zombie novels. These characters mean something and you cant help but want them to succeed. I look forward to reading the second installment. 5 stars."}, {"userName": "Jodi", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5166491-jodi", "userReview": "Solid 3 stars. This is a decent story about a man, John and his infant son as they try to make their way through the aftermath of a zombie infection. The story is compelling and the characters are worth rooting for, however, there are some serious flaws.Good: I cared about the characters and understood their motivation. This is important.The author was pretty good at showing instead of telling - the exposition was mainly at the beginning of the book.Action sequences will keep most readers enthralled - entertaining for sure.I enjoyed reading about a group of survivors working together instead of constantly arguing.Bad:The authors politics invade the story too often. In the first page or two, the main character says that he watches Fox News because it has the least bias. For reals?! Fox is the least biased of news organizations? I had a chuckle and huge eye roll at that one and nearly stopped reading right there. Other signs that the author is a probable Tea Partier - the main character again observes that the government safe areas will be terrible because everything big gov touches it destroys. Also, one of the \"bad\" guys is a politician's staffer. He's bad because he's in politics. More eye rolling from me.The biggest issue is the grammar/formatting problems. In the kindle edition there are far too many missing periods and a severe lack of paragraph indentation. This is an easy fix so why not do it?Some of the cheese was enough to throw me out of the story. Phrases like \"thinking outside the box\" and \"bringing home the bacon\" do not belong in a good novel. At all. I could give a few more examples but whatev.Although there is a strong female lead in the latter part of the book, for the most part females are relegated to being raped or babysitting the lead's kid. {SPOILER} When John is elected as leader of the group, there is nary a women to confirm or deny him. There are some repetition of sentences. \"I personally was curious\" was seen twice, as was a phrase involving \"Cost Go\". There were a few sentences clunky enough to make me blink and go WTF. Editing, seriously, look into it.The gun issue was addressed in an amazon review and is worth mentioning. I'm not a gun person so when the author goes off on the numbers and letters associated with the different types of firearms I was mostly left in the dark. It read like a big gun orgasm to me. And you know what they say about guys with big guns. If the author had taken the time to explain the fire power and shooting styles of what he was carrying (which, to be fair, he does a little bit of that later on), it wouldn't have read so NRA.While I liked the main character, John, and wanted him to succeed, there was an element of Rambo to him. John can do no wrong, John never fails, John is the ultimate leader. He needed to screw up a bit for it be believable.Finally, when you run out of disposable diapers and don't want to leave your stronghold to scavenge more, use your blankets, t-shirts, whatever! Cloth diapers should be the wave of this zombie world. Duh.All in all, for $0.99, this was a decent read. Better than some, that's for sure. With a good editor this could become an excellent novel. I'll look forward to reading more from Mr. Talluto."}, {"userName": "Felicia A", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1739957-felicia-a", "userReview": "A good, thick volume of zombie mayhem and madness. I really did enjoy this book, despite the numerous editing issues. Not enough to take completely away from the story, but definitely in need of editing in a major way.The writing was good, the story was good and full, and there was actually a conclusion. There is room for - but not necessarily a need for - a sequel. A lot could be done to continue this story, but it was wrapped up well, which I always appreciate.Fuller than most self published works in this genre, this book is chock full of adventures, growth of characters and the birth of heroes. I don't really buy how John became the absolute boss of everyone and everything, and as others have mentioned, that was the best behaved baby ever in life. I have my own children, and I know for certain that NO baby is ever as good natured as Jacob was. I think he cried, like, twice in the whole book, and not even when he was in his father's arms in the midst of a zombie-killin' spree.There were a lot of new ideas.....which are needed because, after you read 20 or more of these books, too much of the same thing becomes humdrum. I liked a lot of what Talluto did with his story.What I liked best about this book was the fact that the people were not always on the run. They were able to hold, take back, and connect communities and towns after the Upheaval, and begin again, recreating a semblance of normal lives, even when surrounded by zombies and worse. What's worse than zombies, you say? HUMANS."}, {"userName": "Abigail", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6100497-abigail", "userReview": "This was very hard to read for the first quarter of the book. The horror of possibilities because of a man and a baby. I struggled to be through it at first because of that on my. It terrified me.

John was believable at the beginning and I like him but it just got the point of me going \"really?? Come on!! Give me a break!!\" What kept me reading we're these pockets of good story telling. Maybe the need to have the story end with the baby OK. It was No consistent. But I slogged through so something worthwhile was there. It needed a good edit. There were parts which I would have rated a four. The story grabbed me. I had nightmares so obviously if doesn't suck. It was OK. 2.5 smack average in the middle. I probably won't bother with the rest of this series. The only thing tempting me is to finding out more about the intelligent fast paced zombies. Meh. Who knows. I've owned the book for over a year. I.can't remember if I bought it or got it as freebie on a KDP day. I needed some zombie goodness. As you can see it took me awhile to slog through. Would I recommend it. Not to buy an only of you were bored. I don't know. I'm struggling. This just had really good part and others which made me feel like I was on an acid trip. an others whet I wanted to scream and a few times a sigh of relief. 50/50 on a ya or nay"}, {"userName": "chucklesthescot", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3426724-chucklesthescot", "userReview": "This book got mixed reviews, mainly because of the author's political leanings. The thing is, most characters in these zombies and preppers apocalypse books are likely to be republican, maybe NRA members, prepared to defend themselves and survive. Liberals who are anti-gun are not going to survive long in the books! I expect to have a bit of political bias in most of these books and I just don't get bothered by it mostly, unless it goes too far ie democrat presidents conspiring with terrorists to get guns off normal people. I also expect to see a lot of gun descriptions as this is the way to fight zombies in American set novels. Anyway, to the book! John Talon has lost his wife to the virus and after a tearful goodbye, he decides to try and take their baby son Jake away from home by bike to seek somewhere safer. His brother Mike is alive but trapped inside his own house and wants to follow John's example and flee if he can. Despite seeing the worst of human behaviour during a supply run, John joins up with two men also trying to escape-Tommy and Duncan-for safety in numbers. A zombie attack leaves them stranded at a gas station and when they escape, civilians from the nearby houses join them in a run for a school and the chance to survive as a community.There are two things about this book that I love: lots of action and plenty of zombies and evil survivors! There is a tension in the air through most of the book as we move from one action scene to another. The run to the school and the following battle was very exciting and well written, and the community growing introduces us to more characters like Charlie, moaning faced Frank, Nate, Sarah etc. The big scenes like the school and the supply runs bring plenty zombies to the story which keeps me happy but it was also about the humanity of the survivors and how important it is to work together to stay safe. John also has to juggle the leadership and safety of the group with his duties as a single parent, which adds a new dimension to the plot.The plot is fast moving and ever changing. There are scenes of zombies chasing people, zombie attacks on cars and buildings, evil men holding hostages and demanding safe passage tolls, tense supply runs...all the things you expect from a fast paced zombie book. There is also the plan to set everyone up in guarded apartment blocks to give everyone space and privacy, and to actually have a more normal life despite the chaos. I liked that idea, instead of just living in a solid school building all the time. John and his friends are looking at building a gated community with safe parks and things to allow everyone a better life. It was ambitious but added something new to the story. I also liked the way the zombies were slowing developing and learning to adapt to the hunt. I'm not going to spoil the book but they were interesting changes and I look forward to seeing what they are going to do in later books.I also liked that the two weak and moaning characters were both men. Frank whines, complains and tries to get out of pulling his weight, wanting others to do the dirty, messy and dangerous jobs. As for Kevin, the man is a piece of scum and I kept hoping that he would get eaten-I hate him! But despite disliking them both, they also add more interest to the story. I don't get the need to add a romance into these apocalypse books. Seriously, John has lost his wife yet it doesn't seem to take him long to get attracted to Sarah. Still, it doesn't dominate the story the way it does in some zombie books so it wasn't really annoying.Niggles? Do we need to be told of every darn nappy change that Jake has? I get that he needs frequent changes but I don't need to hear about every one or every feeding he gets! Also at times, it seems that John is the only one who can work things out, as if nobody else has the capacity to think of a plan. This is evident in the first half of the book but does improve as the side characters get more page time later. I love Nate, Charlie, Tommy and Duncan so seeing more of them appeals to me. Having John as less perfect and not being the go to man every time would make the book even better but to be fair, these are very small niggles.This book is loaded with action and emotion, and it doesn't go stale because the author keeps changing the scenes and the form of the action, which was good. Traditional zombie fans should enjoy this and I look forward to the rest of the series."}, {"userName": "Rodney Holmes", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5936912-rodney-holmes", "userReview": "It really felt like a grumpy white guy's dream. There was a strong current that modern america was on the wrong path and the only way to set things right was to wipe the slate clean. These are the things that I liked.1) The characters are well defined and sympathetic.2) The fetishism of guns was kept to a minimum. Guns are useful tools but I get tired of passages talking about guns in the same way teenage boys talk about breasts.3) It was well paced.Things I didn't like.1) The protagonists were all very homogenous. I would imagine the whole group is white anglo-saxon protestant and straight. 2) The antagonists seemed to be the groups that are normally demonized by the conservative movement in the United States. 3) The only mention of a characters race was pointing out that a villan was black."}, {"userName": "Steven Simpson", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10470512-steven-simpson", "userReview": "This is a high paced full action zombie novel full of twists and turns violence zombie slaying mayhem.

At first i felt White flag of the dead was going to be another zombie story that i would enjoy but not be impassioned with - but i found myself thankfully surprised that it had enough twists on the formula to make it vibrant, colourful and interesting. A key thing for me is having read a few zombie apocalyptic stories in the recent past, ive found a lot of them focus on some time after the cataclysmic event in question - where a community has been established and they are fighting to keep that together. but rarely have i read something which describes, with some actual pragmatic thought anyway, how this community actually comes together, hyow its rules get establish and the sacrifices and choices that are made to keep this pocket of humanity from being overwhelmed by a tidal wave of writhing biting dead flesh.I thought the author went to a perfect amount of detail with the actual mechanics of what the group (and chiefly its leader) is trying to do, which coupled with some deftly handled fast paced action makes for a great tale, and much recommended to those who crave some zombie action. I greatly look forward to continuing with the series."}, {"userName": "Kym", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5287940-kym", "userReview": "I can never resist a Zombie book, it's a great weakness and I'm not ashamed to admit it. Therefore, I've read a veritable shit ton of books in the genre and I know generally what to expect. This book isn't the worst I've read in the genre but it's not the best either. The problem here is that there's far too much time spent on certain details (the weapons used, the physical description of individual Zombies being fought) and then not nearly enough character development. I just don't really care about the protagonist. Telling me the same two or three things about his motivation and actions over and over and over doesn't provide any depth. I dunno, the writing overall shows a lack of maturity. I believe there's a lot of books in this series so I'll assume that the writing and the story get better but I'm not particularly intrigued enough to read the rest. Again, it's not a horrible read but there are much better Zombie books out there. 2.5 stars rounded up to 3 stars."}, {"userName": "Bernice Mills", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1695377-bernice-mills", "userReview": "I'm a terrible hypocrite.Ten minutes ago I slammed a book for grammar, and now I'm going to praise another book which has some linguistic issues of its own.White Flag of the Dead is not terribly well-written, in the purely mechanical sense.

Since watching The Walking Dead, I have looked for zombie apocalyptic novels to quench my thirst. Joseph Talluto was the first to do so for me. He understands what it takes when it comes to writing about zombies. 'So what does it take?' you might ask. Weeeelll, lots of gore and blood and descriptive writing, what else? As zombie lovers we want the violence and the survival and we want it from the second we open those books!\u00a0In White Flag of the Dead Book 1: Surrender of the Living, John Talon will do whatever it takes to keep his infant son Jake alive. He promised Ellie, and he promised himself. He has one job; make sure Jakey survives. When it comes to survival, what would you do to protect the ones you love? John has been named leader of his group. Being leader comes with responsibility he never dreamed of asking for, he just takes it head on. The fight is not easy, it never is and it never will be. Not only do\u00a0they have to fear the dead walking among them, but the real monsters in this new world; they're the living.

His style of story telling is a bit different but all in all I have been able to stay hooked. As for other readers complaining about bias...well bias sees bias. As an avid reader I have learned to read past the politics since life seems to revolve around it, though most cannot. There are no sides in politics...except them and us. As they say, \u201cit must be true because the internet says so\u201d. Back to the book...the thing that interests me about these \u201cZ\u201d books is the opinions of the authors on how society will react if faced with the possibility of human annihilation. Who will become the heroes, and who will revert to be the worst. Though I think Joesph has a decent opinion in this story, in my opinion it will be much worse. As bad as the mental health situation these days...those on meds will no longer have them, those who were borderline will now require treatment and those who should have been treated will be even worse off.

Millions more were lost when the victims of the plague refused to stay dead, instead rising to slaughter and feed on those left alive. For survivors like John Talon and his son Jake, they are faced with a choice: submit to the dead or find the will to fight.F.Y.I. this was my favourite line in the book that made me laugh:\n\u201cI\u2019m too tired to play daddy today. Get someone else.\u201d I groaned, rolling over and burying my head in my pillows.\nEven though Ellie wasn't in most of the book, she was still important and I cared about her and I cried when she told her husband over the phone that she was infected and for him to be strong and carry on, and to protect their son and to make sure their son remembers her. :(I think most of the reason I'm fascinated by zombie books is obviously the survival and the adventure, but also I find it intriguing that a enemy that is dumb/brain dead in a way, can destroy so much in such a little amount of time and that virus spreads fast. And because zombies are the un-dead they will never stop coming at the humans as they can't feel pain and they are obsessed with eating food - a.k.a. humans, so they just wont stop attacking. Depending on the story line the Z virus either attacks, harms and infects just the humans or both humans and animals. But in this book it just the humans. As the book goes on these bumbling zombie idiots become less so; as one of them ducked when it was shot at and another looked straight in the eyes at John. I need to read on in this series just to find out more about the reasons of the zombies change in intelligence. That asshole that left his wife and kid to die. Only the mother die so the kid lives. He's such a coward and his son doesn't deserve such a father like him. And yes, he needs to beg his sons forgiveness and I wouldn't blame him if he didn't.

Looking through other reviews I see that most of the complaints about this book are for poor grammar, but I listened to this on audiobook so that of course wasn't a problem. + + + + + + + + + + THE GOOD + + + + + + + + + +1 - EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT - Normally these books focus on the outbreak itself and having the protagonist be a badass, putting off character building moments until later. This book takes the opposite approach, building the character first and then doing the kickass stuff. In my opinion, this is definitely the right way to go about it because when the character finally starts going into danger, I know and care for his survival. 2 - HUMANITY IS NOT ALL EVIL - My biggest complaint with all of these zombie books is how quick humanity descends into evil. In most books, every stranger is either a killer, rapist, or at best someone looking to rob you. In this book those elements of human society are evident, but they aren't the norm. It's a refreshing change. 3 - NOT PRO MILITARY PROPAGANDA - Another complaint with these books is that they push a strong pro-military agenda. Though this book does descend into a bit of gun-porn from time to time, by and large people are taken on their individual skills, and their martial talents are improved through training after the fact. I don't think there is a single character who was in the military which again is a breath of fresh air for this genre. 4 - FOCUSED ON REBUILDING -I like that there is a quick focus on rebuilding society. So many of these books glory in going from one dangerous place to another, never trying to bunk down and make their lives safer so people can survive and thrive. I enjoy seeing people come together like this and making something out of nothing. 5 - PROACTIVE PROTAGONIST - My final pro (that I thought worth mentioning) is that the protagonist is proactive. He doesn't wait for Zombies and other antagonists to come at him and force him into action. Everything that happens in this book is usually a result of him actively going out and trying to stop trouble before it can happen. It makes him instantly more likeable and keeps me eager to read on to see what he will do next. - - - - - - - - - - - THE BAD - - - - - - - - - - 1 - POOR CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT - Outside of the main character, the larger cast doesn't get much in the way of character development. Sometimes we don't even get introduction scenes, just brief sentences to describe who they are when that information is needed. I understand that with a large cast of characters it is implausible to flesh them all out, but the problem was that some of these characters were dying and I was struggling to remember which was which and if I should care. 2 - A LITTLE GENERIC AT TIMES - The problem with all of these Zombie books is that they are a little samey. This one does enough different to keep me interested, but I wouldn't mind it taking a few more twists and turns here and there to differentiate this from the crowd. = = = = = = = = = = = THE VERDICT = = = = = = = = = = Overall I am really impressed with this book. It is well paced, I'm strongly attached to the main character and his son, and I am eager to see what happens next.

Don't get me wrong, the book wasn't light on sticky situations and close calls but it's just that everything of consequence could be predicted 95% of the time. This is a book that holds no twists and few surprises. I do of course realise that this was likely the authors intention, to write a story like this, therefore it won't be fair to deduct a star for something that could well be defined as someone's personal preference. Personally I enjoy this style of narrative and development too, but just bear in mind the kind of book that it is - if you're looking for horror, hopelessness and a palpable feeling of dread in your zombie fiction - I suggest you look elsewhere.3 stars. And only because it kept me interested enough to read from cover to cover and in just a couple of sittings. Which few books, even ones suffering from fewer flaws - actually do."}, {"userName": "John Podlaski", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3772926-john-podlaski", "userReview": "I enjoyed \"White Flag of the Dead\" as it had a different flavor compared to most books in this genre. Sure, it starts out like most others, everything in chaos and pandemonium, characters \"learning\" about the infected and how to deal with them. The main character, John, is a school principal, who had planned for something like this; having taken survival training classes and establishing a cache of supplies and weapons in his basement over the years. The supplies are sufficient to sustain his family for several months. Unfortunately, John's wife, a nurse in the local hospital, is bitten while at work during the onset, leaving John and their four-month old son, Jake, to fend for themselves.The setting is in a suburb of Chicago and John fortifies his home in hopes of riding out this Pandemic. However, it is soon evident that the hoards of undead are growing in size as they move out of the city and into surrounding suburbs - going house-to-house looking for living nourishment. John soon decides to bug out, leaving many of his supplies and weapons behind, intent on locating other survivors and a safer place to defend.During this trek, John learns that the Z's have extraordinary hearing and a sense of smell, making it more difficult for survivors to hide. In the coming days, survivors begin following John and his son, the group continuous to grow as the people believe in him to get them through this mess. But instead of hiding, John takes the offensive to rid the area of z's - more intent to live than survive. He makes the rules, has a vision of rebuilding and being self-sufficient, and insists that everyone is properly trained in both self-defense and weapons before moving out. How many will follow him? Do they succeed in his quest or was it all a pipe dream? Read it to find out!Kudos to the author for writing this story / series! As an author myself, I understand the sacrifice and amount of hours it takes to undertake a project such as this. My only criticism is the amount of typos, added or missing words throughout the tome - investing in an editor would have made a big difference. Never the less, I have already purchased the next book in the series and look forward to the further adventures of John and his group.John Podlaski, authorCherries - A Vietnam War Novel"}, {"userName": "Chad", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8635667-chad", "userReview": "I read this book last night. Overall I enjoyed the story. The plot was interesting. The characters are well developed. I wouldn't say there was anything particularly new about this zombie book that hasn't been done elsewhere but I'm not looking for groundbreaking just an enjoyable read. I would give this book a 65 on the zombie hope spectrum. I just made up the zombie hope spectrum so I'll explain. The zombie hope spectrum is rating between 0 and 100 of the tone of a book with a rating of 0 being were it is clear from the tone of the book that all humanity is doomed. We are really just reading to see how everyone dies. Last man alive, no hope of repopulating the earth just trying to stay alive for a little longer you get the idea. These are the books where no matter what decisions the characters make bad things happen and people die as slowly the party is whittled away until the very last. Maybe there is a glimmer of hope here or there but your holding your breath waiting for the other shoe to drop every time. I would put the short story \"I am legend\" at near zero on this spectrum. I realize the story involves vampires and not zombies but really it works for the majority of \"near end of the world\" type literature but I mostly read zombie books so ... A book with a rating of 100 is one where it is clear that the zombie thing is just a minor blip on the road. I would rate World War Z at 90 or so primarily because the book is set up as a history of events that already happened so we know humanity survives. My life as a white trash zombie would be an example of a 100 where not only does humanity survive zombies but it turns out being a zombie is not that bad either."}], "description": "White Flag of the Dead: Book 1 Surrender of the Living.Millions died when the Enillo Virus swept the earth.
