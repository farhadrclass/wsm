It starts out rather like a paranormal romance. A lot of time is devoted to Joanne's relationship with David, who has made her into a djinn, since she died horribly in the last book. Although they don't come out and say it, there's definitely a strong emotional tie between them that I'd call love. David seems a little more committed than Joanne, and I'm not sure how I felt about that (Joanne is still sorting out her feelings). They spend a lot of time getting to know each other, with the major objective of David trying to teach her to be a djinn. Joanne loves her connection with David, and likes being a djinn, although it's very intense--their perceptions are a lot more intense than humans, and it throws her for a loop. Rahel, a djinn that Joanne had a few run-ins with in Ill Wind shows up. Her task is to escort Joanne and David to David's friend, and the most powerful djinn in the world, Jonathan, where she finds out the enormous price David paid to save her life. Jonathan is not too happy with Joanne, but out of his loyalty to David, he gives her one week to learn to exist as a djinn without drawing on her connection to David. If she can't adjust, then her number is up.Unfortunately, learning to be a djinn doesn't turn out to be the biggest of Joanne's problems. There is a huge imbalance in the forces that control the weather, fire, and the earth, causing potentially major catastrophes to occur. With some odd anomalies in the aetheric, which is sort of an intangible layer in the upper spheres of the atmosphere where the Wardens and djinn manipulate the earth forces to control them, that turn out to be very dangerous, especially to the djinni. And then, there's a very wicked woman who wants control of David, and is willing to use Joanne to get that control. Yikes. Things get pretty wonky in this book. Admittedly, Heat Stroke started out slowly. Don't get me wrong. I love my romance, but not as so much of the focus in an urban fantasy book. Frankly, I was starting to wonder when the action was going to start. I suppose that Ms. Caine planned it that way, because I was thrown for a loop with what happens next. Joanne finds out the hard way the worst part about being a djinn, when she gets claimed by a very troubled teenaged boy, under the guidance of the stepmonster from Hell, a woman that David hates with a burning passion. Ms. Caine manages to skillfully weave this story with a rich mix of action, angst, sensuality, and the power of loves lost and found. Joanne is a good protagonist. She has some aspects that lend her narrative voice to chick lit, but at the same time, she has the credibility to be a good action heroine. She's quick thinking, and courageous, dealing with some pretty hairy situations, and trying to work around her new master, Kevin, who inspired a complex combination of sympathy and disgust within me (he has very poor hygiene, but it's for a reason which made me very sad). I really liked the djinn aspects. It brought to mind the sly wit of \"I Dream of Jeannie\", but also the origin folklore of djinni (which I appreciate even more). The humor is good, and I liked the biting sarcasm, wry humor, and fashion-oriented voice of Joanne. Of course, I love David. He's quite a co-star in this book--with the potential to steal the show. Lewis (who I also love), Joanne's old flame and friend, and the most powerful Warden on Earth, has a big role, which looks like it will play out heavily in the next book.So, despite the slowish start, and the fact that some of the atmospheric lingo and physics went over my head (although it was kind of interesting at the same time), this turned out to be a very good read. Ms. Caine more than delivers the goods with this second installment in the Weather Warden series. I'm not quite sure where she'll go with this story, but I'm definitely invested. The next book is definitely going to deal with some huge implications, based on the crazy cliffhanger in this book. I like the science and folklore aspects, and the message about how great power has even greater consequences, both in the right and wrong hands. I'd recommend this book to urban fantasy fans, but don't give up if the beginning drags a little."}, {"userName": "Sanaa", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5944522-sanaa", "userReview": "[2.5 Stars] This one was pretty meh. I wanted more weather wardens, less djinn, more character development, and a plot that connected things together better. This really didn't give me any of the above. Some scenes I loved, but I missed a lot of the things I loved about the first book. Like the way we got to know the characters and the way the little plot points came together. This just didn't seem as well thought out, and I don't unfortunately think I'm going to continue with the series."}, {"userName": "AH", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3255548-ah", "userReview": "I need the next book! The Weather Warden series by Rachel Caine is not like any other urban fantasy series. There are no werewolves. No vampires. This series focuses on a talented group of people known as the Weather Wardens. Their mission: to control the weather and ensure the least amount of damage to people and property. The Weather Wardens are assisted by powerful djinns (genies). The world building in this series is well done. Rachel Caine has the ability to describe almost every particle and atom of existence and make it interesting. Her depictions of malevolent storms are fascinating. Her storms have character, strength, and destructive powers. I loved her depiction of the aetheric and the cold light and blue sparks. Beautiful. The plot moved along quite quickly and I enjoyed watching the main character Jo\u2019s transformation. Jo needs to make some adjustments to her new situation. The author captures Jo\u2019s frustrations and fears well, adding in subtle touches of humor: Jo can\u2019t seem to get her hair right, no matter how hard she tries. The Weather Wardens is an exciting addition to the long list of urban fantasy series out there. The good news \u2013 this series is complete, with a 4 book (so far) spin-off series so you can read at your leisure. The bad news \u2013 this book ends in a cliffhanger. Off to read Chill Factor (book 3)!Review posted on Badass Book Reviews."}, {"userName": "Natasha", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2496802-natasha", "userReview": "If you haven't read Ill Wind(book 1) this review may contain spoilers. If you have, read on! Heat Stroke is the second installment in the Weather Wardens series by Rachel Caine. Joanne, once a powerful, yet impulsive Weather warden is now a Djinn. David turned her and now he's trying to teach her the ropes. Jo now must leave all things human behind(which she finds easier said than done) and learn how to be a djinn. What she doesn't realize is what Daivd had to go through to create her and now things are upside down in the rift. She finally meets Jonathon(the one powerful god of the Djinn) and is told she must learn to harness power on her own or it won't just be her that will face the coincidences. She has to be assigned to another Djinn to be trained and than Djinn is Patrick.(The only successful human-to-djinn transformation.) During her study with Patrick, Lewis asks permission for Joanne to be his Djinn to help him fix the rift, but doesn't succeed. Joanne is then captured by a horrible woman who will use her in ways she would never choose willingly.  I found this book a little more slow at the start, but the action and twists just before half way through made up for it. Again like the first book, I love the idea of the Weather Wardens and really find this series fresh and unique. The covers didn't draw me to it particularly, but like the old saying goes, \"Don't judge a book by it's cover!\" I really enjoyed the twists in this book. And like the first book, it ended on a cliffhanger with Joanna's new existence. Synopsis:Mistaken for a murderer, Weather Warden Joanne Baldwin is hunted down and killed by her colleagues. Reborn as a Djinn, she senses something sinister entering earth's atmosphere-something that makes tomorrow's forecast look deadly"}, {"userName": "Bunnycore", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50919516-bunnycore", "userReview": "Okay Jo is back, she is now a Djinn. She has to learn quick to save herself and her man from a bad situation. let's see there is a lot of angst in this one and I am going to say that I loved the whole Paul, Lewis thing on this one. I mean David is yummy but I feel that he was able to back away from Jo. I dunno I don't feel the love between them yet. Maybe it will come in later books I will have to wait and see when i go off to buy the third I will be reading the third book. I don't have much to say.

I'm sorry because I blew about $35 on 4 of these books at once on the say so of an enthusiastic fan who insisted that I \"must buy\" the first 4 because they run together and I'd regret it if I didn't. I'm sorry because I see a lot of people like these...but I am beginning to wonder if $35 is reason enough to slog through more of this. This one is starting out as silly and uninteresting as the first.Oooooh...she's not human anymore....oooooh she still likes to drive fast....ooooh she's vulnerable because she's now a \"free Djinn\" and could be \"claimed....ooooh, you get the idea. I'm this close to flinging all 4 into my to be sold box leaving the last 2 unopened.I'll let you know. AFTER READING TO PAGE (almost)40.ENOUGH!I got through 40 pages, Joanne has gone from being an overly romantic rather dense woman to being an overly romantic dense Djinn. The book is beginning with attempts at foreshadowing done through hinting at another past relationship etc., etc, etc. I'm sorry, it's not worth it. I am not dragging myself through another long pointless road trip being told how much Joanne likes to drive fast and the way her car acts (and of course feels) about it. I am not interested in how difficult it is for Joanne to \"turn off or down\" her sexual senses and reactions now that she's \"no longer human\".I've read that Ms. Caine has written other novels. I hope with all my heart that they are better than this. I have learned my lesson...don't buy books on the insistence of a mega-fan of the writer. I assume I fell prey to someone who is a romance fan...but it has cost me money from my \"limited book budget\". I was told that if I liked the Butcher Dresden books I'd like these...not so. I rate the Dresden books as some of my favorites...these, the last 2 will join the first 2 in the \"to be sold box\" without being read. I've run on this problem once before...if you liked the Dresden books then you'll like, whatever. Apparently Jim Butcher transcends a lot of other tastes. I am sadly disappointed with these books and will be very careful about what I buy on the advice, \"if you like Harry Dresden you'll like these\" in the future. 1 Star..and it's a gift from me.

And, that would have been a loss. I delayed forever because I didn't like the way the first one ended. When I finally DID start, there is a massive sex scene right at the beginning, and I (wrongly) feared it was going to be jam packed with sex, sex, sex . . . SOOOO - once I *got* started, I couldn't put the darn thing down. Joanne is so full of snark and nonsense that I really don't see how I could NOT love her. She is also *extremely* fashion conscious. I mean seriously. Like, I feel like she would not be impressed with my so not designer wardrobe . . . A very interesting part of this story is the David and Jonathan relationship. Made me tilt my head and think twice. Also made me more interested in the entire series. Just a teensy thing to think about.As to the story itself, there were many times that I saw things coming - and several that I kicked myself because I *should* have seen them coming. I didn't really read it for the amazing plot points, but just for the joy of spending time with Joanne. One of the failures (at least to me) was the whole \"we fixed the world in the last book, but what we did broke the world again\" syndrome that appears to me to be happening in this series. This really annoys me - if you fix the world, doggone it, FIX THE WORLD.Really though - I loved it. I loved Joanne. I loved David. I loved Lewis.

Another example where when they made their way to the aetheric planes, I skimmed. But as with the first book, after skimming (to me) boring stuff, the rest of the book was really good.

Things feel oddly chaotic and unrooted. It just feels off.In addition, there are a couple things that just continue to agitate me. Lewis, like the rest of the series as a whole, feels like he just can't get it together. It is weird and undermining for someone this badass to be... almost meek. He has been rescued, by my count, 4 times in 2 books. What the heck? I like Lewis, I really do. But I feel like it is time to ... well, to be crass, shit or get off the pot. He needs to take control of his life, put himself in the driver's seat, and stop just being a passenger. He also needs to make some connections, real connections, because the lone ranger thing clearly isn't working out so well for him. Nor is he happy. The Wardens all - ALL - piss me off. I hate the whole lot of them, and can only pray that, since the storm didn't finish them off this book, next book Mother Nature will try dropping tactical nukes. I'll be honest, I am having a really difficult time with the fact that they are all self-righteous, self-assured moronic douchecanoes. Every single decision they make is the wrong one, and it is becoming tedious. Having them pop up to constantly accuse Jo of being a villain and carrying this looming threat of lobotomy... frankly, they are becoming ridiculously caricatured inept villains. And the Djinn are just the other side of the same coin. I have sympathy for them, because the enslavement is HORRIBLE. As this book clearly demonstrated, it is rape. But then at the same time, they behave like they are twins to the Wardens. Equally full of themselves, equally positive that the sun shines out of their collective asses and they aren't capable of a wrong decision. I am tired of having every single character in this book be an enemy. Even ones who don't intend to be - Lewis, David - still cause harm by making decisions that have horrible repercussions for Jo (let me bind you to my bottle, it's safe, I promise; let me tear the universe asunder for you, I am sure that can't be as bad as it sounds, right?). It becomes depressing, and a little emo, to watch her continually beat down by everyone around her. She's surrounded by people who either leave her dealing with consequences not of her own making (Lewis, David, Jonathan), or think she's the Devil Incarnate and is single-handedly calling down the End of Times (all the Wardens, a good handful of djinn, and even herself on occasion with all the \"it's my fault\" whining... though really, who can blame her for feeling that way, given all that is going on around her).That said, I love the universe. I love the powers. I love the sentient nature. I love the possibilities. I think this series could be AMAZING if it would just get it's shit together. So I will keep reading, and keep my fingers crossed."}, {"userName": "Angela", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1744856-angela", "userReview": "Spoiler Alert: Please do not read this review unless you have already read the first book in this series, Ill Wind. The events of this book are strongly based on the ending of the last and I would hate to give anything away. I do have a review of Ill Wind that I posted in July.*******************************Heat Stroke essentially picks up right where Ill Wind left off. Joanne Baldwin was transformed from a human Weather Warden to a Djinn in order to preserve her life. Now she must learn to use her new abilities while navigating in social circles where she does not understand the rules. There is also a new, unknown rift threatening to tear the world apart.Heat Stroke is another fast-paced book. Joanne barely has time to cope with one crisis when another strikes. She is again unable to gain her footing and often acts impulsively on whatever little information she has to go on at the time. Joanne is definitely not a big-picture girl and fails to see how all the pieces fit together until it is nearly too late. In this, she is a very flawed heroine. However, without this impulsive nature most of the action in these books would not take place.I am enjoying the Weather Warden series as quick, entertaining reads. I am not strongly invested in the characters, although I am hoping to see some growth from Joanne in future books. Although both books in the series so far have focused on disasters of large scale significance. the books have enough light moments to keep from becoming too heavy."}, {"userName": "Sandy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2463587-sandy", "userReview": "Heat Stroke is the second installment in the Weather Warden series by Rachel Caine. It picks up where Ill Wind finishes and follows Joanne Baldwin, former Weather Warden turned Djinn, and her Djinn lover David, as they begin a new journey together, as free-range, unclaimed Djinns. Before Joanne was a powerful Weather Warden who possessed a Demon Mark and died becoming a hero.. but what nobody knows (except for Lewis) is that she was reborn into a Djinn thanks to David. Now that the damage has been done, she must learn the ropes to harnessing and using her newfound powers (which are pretty cool!).Danger in the form of a rift in the aetheric finds their way to David and Joanne, who both are stumped and clueless when they come across coldlight (aka blue glitter/sparklies) that is both unheard of and questionable, leaking from the rift. Trouble calls when they are both ordered to see Jonathan - the first and most powerful Djinn (aka their god). Turns out the consequences of David breaking laws and turning Joanne into a Djinn must be paid. What Joanne doesn't know is that David's actions caused him to become weaker and weaker ('suicide by girl') as he continues to pour his energy into sustaining Joanne as they are both just half a Djinn. She has a week to learn the hard way how to fully adjust by learning under the tutelage of Patrick - the only other human who successfully changed into a Djinn. She can no longer rely on David's help as he's now under Jonathan's control. Learning from Patrick is not the hard part - it is escaping being claimed when the pair, along with Lewis, are paid an unexpected visit from Yvette Prentiss - a beautiful female version of Bad Bob - and teenage stepson Kevin. As it turns out, Patrick owes her a favour and that favour is repaid by taking Joanne. Joanne is now claimed for the first time by her horny, lecherous stepson. But she's only a means to an end. Yvette is really after David, and has been for a long time. This is when the action starts to escalate as Joanne must find a way to save David (as he eventually comes to save Joanne and gets reclaimed by the evil, sadistic Yvette to pay the price for her freedom), free herself from Kevin, and help repair the rift - oh and save the world at the same time, with very limited help. The Weather Warden series is fast becoming one of my favourites. The storylines are not always enticing but the plot really does thicken and the action kicks in about halfway through this book. Joanne is a spectacular force to be reckoned with. She's smart, lethal, heroic, and has nine lives. She's also witty, sarcastic, fearless and isn't afraid to question authority. As far as heroines go, she's likeable and well-rounded and remains constant, although the other characters around her change and grow. I definitely recommend this series to any romance/paranormal/urban fantasy/adventure fans. I have very few complaints. You really get sucked into Joanne's world and as a reader, find it pretty hard to get your head out of the book! 4.5/5 stars."}, {"userName": "Shelley", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3081722-shelley", "userReview": "Mistaken for a murderer, Weather Warden Joanne Baldwin is hunted down and killed by her colleagues in Las Vegas.

Rachel Caine wasn't kidding with the end of  Ill Wind. And the second Weather Warden book, Heat Stroke, takes that unexpected ending and runs with it. Wild. And Jo doesn't get much more of a breather than the reader does as she's plunged headlong into life as a Djinn. Or one half of a Djinn. Or a Djinn in training. Who can tell for sure?Good thing the lovely David is there to help her get a grip on her new reality. Unfortunately, it turns out David broke a few not-so-minor rules when he saved her life and the head Djinn Jonathan isn't happy with him. No, sir. Jonathan's not a bit happy. Before she can catch her breath, he turns Jo over to the rather dubious (but hilarious) Patrick to complete her training. In a week. Or die. And if Jo dies? Yep, you've got it. David'll be gone too. *sob* Of course, it's Jo we're talking about here. So the words \"fighting chance\" actually mean something. Plus, where Jo is, Lewis can never be very far. And with Lewis lurking about, waggling his fingers at the cosmos, channeling a grown up Charles Wallace Murry like nobody's business, chances of surviving an apocalypse are slightly better.Even so, nothing is as it seems in this book and you can't necessarily trust who you thought you could. I've tried to avoid spoilers for the following books in the series, so I don't know where Caine is going with all this mayhem, but I kind of dig it.

Heat Stroke was a way slicker book than the first one, fast-paced and easier to get into than simply a road trip and reminiscing about the times which was pretty much sums up Ill Wind. I absolutely love the cool factor of both Joanne and her powers, either as a Djinn or Weather warden. This book contains descriptions of meteorology that border on being too scientific, but wow they just blow my mind! Not to mention the descriptions of how Djinn draw their power. The author holds great imagination and skilfully conveys something which seems to be difficult to understand into such a readable, easily digested format. A thing I am loving so far about this series: it's so incredibly addictive, with a writing style so natural that it flows easily. That's probably a flow on from Rachel Caine's YA writing.I absolutely adore the male leads in Joanne's life, David, the sexy Djinn and Lewis, the world's most powerful weather warden. Joanne's wit, charisma and sheer determination just matches both of these men well, and she can definitely keep up with them.Later on in the book, you do meet some twisted and disturbing characters, but it does lead to an epic finale in the end.

She\u2019s no longer the same person\u2026or even the same species. We see a lot of the same faces from book one and meet a couple of seriously creepy bad guys.

This time, I'm fairly sure it's not gonna take me anywhere near as long to pick up the next installment."}, {"userName": "Jex", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4395101-jex", "userReview": "Random thoughts, not a full review:This book was a slight disappointment after the first book. First off, I was turned off by the beginning of the book with Joanne's constant sensual experiences as a new Djinn. I'm happy this portion of the book finally ended and got on to some real content. There is nothing worse then a boy crazy heroine that does nothing for herself. And yes, I realize she was new to her body/form and needed to learn, but some of it was over the top and too much about boys/sex. My second complaint, how many times is Jo going to die? It's book two and she has died at least twice now and changed form twice. What next? Will she magically discover she has Earth powers now instead of storm powers? Will she end up more powerful then Lewis? Will she die and become a fire fighting bunny?Overall I still enjoyed the story line and will continue to read the series. I simply don't have high hopes for the next book. I hope that I'm proven wrong."}, {"userName": "T.J.

She would get in one situation after another where she had a chance to make a difference and take responsibility for problems that were either in part or wholly her fault, each time she balked and as a result things got worse. I guess I just can't get into a character that is so self absorbed and irresponsible. Maybe she grows through out the series and learns from her mistakes but, I doubt it.After reading one of Rachel Caine's short stories in an anthology I had high hopes for this series. Perhaps I will try one of her later pieces."}, {"userName": "Magdalena Kaminska", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56807447-magdalena-kaminska", "userReview": "I didn't enjoyed the first book on this series but I really liked this one.

Why is it that this book had to go all downhill on us? It was great in the beginning with David and Joanne's road trip. Loved the romance between them, also the little tension between her and Lewis. Just love little love triangles. However, the sweet romance and such doesn't keep up. It gets bad when Joanne is separated from David and her other potential romance. However, even though nothing happens in the middle, it gets interesting towards the end with all the action. Not only is Joanne kidnapped by an evil person, something later happens to David and they must all race to save him from the diabolical deeds of his capture. At the end is a cliffhanger, where everyone's fates hang in the balance. Can't wait to read the next book. Hopefully better than this one since her and David are reunited."}, {"userName": "Nichole", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15803391-nichole", "userReview": "After being accused of murder, then killed by the good guys, Joanne is getting ready for her funeral. Even though she is now a Djinn, David thinks it's a very bad idea. She is supposed to be focusing on Djinn-like behavior. She has a lot to learn. But, certain people have other plans for her. While I liked the story, my problem is Joanne. She is just not that likeable. I love characters like Chess from Downside, Meg from the Others, Alex Craft, Charley Davidson just to name a few. I really don't care for Joanne much. It sucks, because the story is good, and I do like Lewis, David, and Paul.

I read the first one, and I was like, 'Meh'. I listened to this one on audiobook, and even though the narrator was AWESOME, I was *still* like, 'That was meh'.I don't know what it is. I guess I like trudging through it because it's such an odd bit of fantasy and supernatural that it's almost like a breath of fresh air. I mean, thus far, there hasn't been a single vampire or werewolf, so for that much I'm thankful.But... I don't care about ANY of the characters. Joanne doesn't really appeal to me. And, it's not because there's anything unappealing about her character. Rather, there's not anything that really sticks out. She's a spitfire, questions authority, loves fashion and cars... but most of the time, I'm just like, 'So what?'. David, I never felt the love connection there. It was seriously something that just like instantly happened and was established by the end of the last book, and it's not really explored any further in this novel. And, they're apart for most of the novel anyway. So, aside from being really good-looking... why do they love each other? The villain of this book, Yvette, sort of just... shows up, and I'm not really sure why or where she came from.Lewis, I do kind of like. I like that he's patient, compassionate, caring in spite of being so put upon and long-suffering. That's an interesting duality. And Kevin was amusing here and there. And believably fucked up enough to be set up as the next villain.But, as with any story, it's probably not a good thing for your reader to like secondary characters and villains better than your main characters.The plot moves *very* fast and never really slows down. And it felt like... I don't really know how to describe it. It felt like thing A happened so that thing B could happen so that thing C could happen, so on and so forth, but thing C doesn't ever come back to thing A in any meaningful way. Is there a name for that sort of plot? It would've helped if we had some sort of explanations or world-building to help things slow down a bit, but like I said, things happen way fast in this novel.And maybe my biggest 'meh' factor is that this novel or the novel before never really took the time to sell the premise to me. I'm a fan of world-building that really convinces me and lets me suspend my disbelief (and I guess because of that, I like characters that learn things as the reader learns them), but at the beginning of the first novel, Joanne has been in this world for a number of years already. And it's like, 'This is how things are. Buy it or don't.' So, it took me like two months to get through this entire audiobook, and every time something fantastical would happen, I'd be like, 'Huh, that's funny/weird.' Not like, 'Oh my god that's so cool' like I should have been.This is not nearly as coherent as my other reviews. Mostly because I don't understand my feelings about this book. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't particularly good, and aside from what I've already touched upon, there's something that I can't quite put my finger on for why..."}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12797140-jen", "userReview": "[Joanne and David are linked and . . .

I felt that Joanne, while likeable in the first book, is very flat in this book. She has to learn how to be a Djiin and learn fast. A week to learn all the nuances of how to exist in a world where she no longer really exists? I felt that the first few chapters were filled with gratuitous sex scenes just to try and captivate the reader when all it did was make wonder if a plot was coming anytime soon. Then when the plot did finally reveal itself it seemed a bit ridiculous. Thanks for the unnatural way that David had Joanne reborn there is now a rift in the Void leaking in bad fairy dust particles that are capable of eating Djiin alive? And not only is Joanne the only one that can fix it, but it helps her regain her human form? Nope. Didn't like it. I also didn't like the way that Kevin was portrayed - sadistically evil but only because he had been abused by his evil stepmother... he's really just a kid with no one that really loved him, and come on he's not really a bad guy so feel a little sympathy....psyche, he really is the bad guy and now he's captured the most powerful Djiin of all? Did not work for me at all. Also, what's with the super long chapters and an epilogue that was really just a playlist of songs? That seemed very strange to me, and frankly I'm surprised those weren't addressed by the editor's somewhere along the way.Greatly disappointed in this series, which sucks because I have enjoyed her work up until now.Until next time,~Lisa"}, {"userName": "Greenly J", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/625226-greenly-j", "userReview": "So in an excellerated frenzy i searched for a book that would tide me over the first week of Summer vacation. I chose the First Book of this series Ill Wind. Found it decent but not amazing had what I wanted in the time that I wanted it. Only problem was that it took me a Day to finish so I made myself read the sequel. This book is easy, with some interesting parts. The biggest problem is the delivery. So Caine has this awesome view where storms are actually living creatures set out to destroy us. That is wonderful. Have weather wardens to combat them. I'm lovin it. Main character is a independent woman kickin ass.Yes you caught me. But then you actually read and become the character. It was flat. She was a sarcastic bitch. The whole time she made quips about everything. I guess she was supposed to be comedic but it failed. Instead of laughing I groaned AT EVERY CORNY JOKE. Also she did not have a reason for her personality. Actually she did not have a personality. Wait. . . . Nope take that back.- Loves sex - sarcastic- has few friends- Has a mom but we have no idea what she is about- Stupid takes her forever to figure things out.- Also has some type of mechanism that makes every guy in novel instantly love her ???? Maybe not sure I would probably have liked this book more if the author had showed depth in her character. Maybe I am confused. Maybe the Caine did accomplish what she wanted. - Pretty girl with a lot of power but doesn't know it - Many guys lover her- People are against her- some type of conflict- Conflict is resolved- SEX!!!!!!!!- People find out that the girl was right For real I thought I was reading a Shojo Manga"}], "description": "Mistaken for a murderer, Weather Warden Joanne Baldwin is hunted down and killed by her colleagues.
