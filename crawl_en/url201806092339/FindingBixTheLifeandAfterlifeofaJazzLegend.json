It has a novel, \"postmodern\" concept that it executes without tooting its own horn- it's a biography made up of the writer's criticism of all the other biographies written about the subject. It falls just short of being bitchy.The result is a story that avoids all the biography cliches and pitfalls, because the writer calls out all the times they happen in the other biographies.This is like an intentionally failed biography. The writer doesn't claim to have figured out the subject or have the final word on him. In the end, I learned a bunch of things that might have been true about influential 20's and 30's jazz musician Bix Beiderbecke, but they also might not have been true. I liked this book's honesty. On another level, though, this was also just a dorky discussion about rumors about a semi-obscure person who has a lingering cult following. It ended up being as much about the cult as about the person. I felt like I was lurking on a private internet forum. Long story short, this was a strange, innovative, probably non-essential book that I'm glad I read."}, {"userName": "Harold", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1016399-harold", "userReview": "If your not already familiar with Bix Beiderbecke this ISN'T where you should begin. That being said it is an excellent book. Get familar with the conventional story and (better yet) develop an appreciation for Bix's playing. Not a conventional biography but rather an exploration of the legend that surrounds Bix. And it is somewhat of a debunking of these legends. What is indisputable is that he was a great musician, an innovator of the first order and he influenced the music that came after him. Wolfe attacks and takes apart the \"tortured genius\" aspect of Bix with research and interviews, some of which raise additional questions, which Wolfe addresses. Wolfe wants to find out what kind of guy was Bix and basically concludes that he was probably a regular guy. I tend to agree with this. Plus I knew some old timers who knew Bix and they all looked askance at the tortured genius story. I've been a professional musician since the mid 1960s and played with a great many musicians. I've known a few who I considered geniuses, but I never met a \"tortured\" genius. I've known guys who overdid literally everything but they enjoyed it. Most of them survived. The thing is Bix liked to get high, as did Bird and all the tortured business is romantic BS. Wolfe says as much here and Miles Davis said the same thing about Bird. They just enjoyed getting high and their physique was not able to withstand the life style. Many people could and did and survived into a ripe old age."}, {"userName": "Daniel", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/638550-daniel", "userReview": "This review originally published in Looking FOr a Good Book. Rated 3.5 of 5I first became aware of Bix Beiderbecke when I heard him on a tune played on Public Radio and I immediately went out to purchase a few CDs that featured his horn. I enjoy listening to a Beiderbecke song, but part of that comes from the fact that I've been a fan of jazz music since I started listening to music (closing in on half a century). I would not consider myself to be a Bix fanatic, however.I was expecting this to be a Bix Beiderbecke biography - it's sub-titled \"The Life and Afterlife of a Jazz Legend\" after all - but it's not quite a biography ... and it's a little more than a biography? Mysterious? Yeah ... so was Bix.What author Brendan Wolfe appears to do is track down all the various things written (and said) about Bix and put them into perspective - separating fact from myth as much as possible. This seems to be a tremendous challenge because Bix was a bag of contradiction and an empty canvas (except when he was playing). In fact the descriptions that stood out to me were when he was described with a blank expression.\"It was only when I looked at his face,\" (guitar player Eddie) Condon wrote, \"and saw the absence there that things got cold and tight around me and I stiffened my drink.\"The same blank expression - what Condon described as \"the absence\" and what (Ralph) Berton dubbed his \"private astronomy\"- that marked Bix.... We can't help but wonder where he's off to and, if we could, would we want to follow him there?Later Wolfe clever writes: \"But he had stopped listening, his face now a Bixian shade of blank.\"What we discover through Wolfe's book is that Bix was an enigma - which does not deter (maybe even helps) his legion of fans. Convention/conferences/festivals take place annually in honor of this musician who burned out in his late 20's almost 90 years ago. Wolfe attends a Bix-Fest in Racine, WI where fans re-enact Bix and Hoagy Carmichael listening to The Firebird Suite. To his fans, Bix was a living legend - a god - and they have an explanation for everything or willing denial for anything too terrible.But I think the best analysis of Bix comes from jazz pianist and Bixophile Brad Kay who Wolfe quotes:I think the reason why Bix Beiderbecke is the most punctiliously documented jazz musician is precisely because he was so slippery and indefinable as a person. ... Who he was doesn't really matter a bit as far as I'm concerned. I mean, he was a poor, confused guy who was in the grip of a demon somehow. ... He was simply possessed by the music. It dwelled in him. It was an entity. It was above and beyond, separate from and not connected to any real human life....Bix, even at the end, sat at the piano and played the same incredible, marvelous, inventive, original stuff, and then (Eddie) Condon looked at his face and he saw the absence there, the dead eyes. ... And it's easy to see why legends accrue to him because you know he was definitely in the grip of something. he was staring into space. The music was just coursing through him and volition, desire, a definable goal - none of this had anything to do with that.And Kay sums it up nicely: \"He spent most of his life just trying to be a regular guy, which he was anything but.\" And these descriptions offered up by Kay make the most sense and I wish Wolfe had ended his book with these keen insights.But this is the biggest problem with the book ... the random revelations. Wolfe gives the reader the story in chronological order ... not chronological in terms of Bix's life, but in terms of what Wolfe discovered and when. Or so it seems at least. And this takes us on some strange tangents. Wolfe even recognizes this. \"Admittedly, I've lost the thread of our narrative a bit\" he writes, early on in the book.The information here about Bix Beiderbecke was quite interesting, but the relating of it was too much of a jumble to really have the impact that could have had.Looking for a good book? Finding Bix by Brendan Wolfe is an interesting look at how a legend is created when biographical information is difficult to come by and often contradictory. The book examines other sources and personal insight, but the narrative is as jumbled as Bix's life.I received a digital copy of this book from the publisher, through Netgalley, in exchange for an honest review.All quotes come from an Advance Reader's copy of the book and the published edition may reflect changes, corrections, or updates."}, {"userName": "Linda Smith", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10025094-linda-smith", "userReview": "Finding Bix is not a conventional biography. It does not evolve chronologically. The book is reminiscent of jazz. It starts a story, riffs on it until you forget the original melody and eventually circles back to the beginning. Bix Beiderbecke is one of those brilliant artists who appeared on the scene, changed the genre and self-destructed at a young age. He played with Louis Armstrong and Hoagy Carmichael and other well known musicians in the late 1920's and very early 1930's. Bix died in 1931 at the age of 28. His fame is most notable among cornet players, jazz musicians, and residents of Davenport, Iowa. Had he lived longer, he would have achieved broader recognition in the general public. My favorite parts of this book were when the author, or one of the many people whom he interviewed, told his personal story of why Bix was important to him. Brendan Wolfe spent 13 years researching and writing this story and seems to have left no source unchecked. Finding Bix is a fascinating book and a nice introduction for someone like me who had never heard of this talented jazz musician."}, {"userName": "Judith Kerr", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10312419-judith-kerr", "userReview": "As an Iowan, I have been enamored with Bix for years. Brendan Wolfe must have read every book or mention of Bix. One still would not KNOW Bix after reading this. Most of the questions about him are still not sure fire answered. I finished it, but was not pleased with this effort."}], "description": "Bix Beiderbecke was one of the first great legends of jazz. Among the most innovative cornet soloists of the 1920s and the first important white player, he invented the jazz ballad and pointed the way to \u201ccool\u201d jazz. But his recording career lasted just six years; he drank himself to death in 1931\u2014at the age of twenty-eight. It was this meteoric rise and fall, combined with the searing originality of his playing and the mystery of his character\u2014who was Bix? not even his friends or family seemed to know\u2014that inspired subsequent generations to imitate him, worship him, and write about him. It also provoked Brendan Wolfe\u2019s Finding Bix a personal and often surprising attempt to connect music, history, and legend. A native of Beiderbecke\u2019s hometown of Davenport, Iowa, Wolfe grew up seeing Bix\u2019s iconic portrait on everything from posters to parking garages. He never heard his music, though, until cast to play a bit part in an Italian biopic filmed in Davenport. Then, after writing a newspaper review of a book about Beiderbecke, Wolfe unexpectedly received a letter from the late musician's nephew scolding him for getting a number of facts wrong. This is where Finding Bix begins: in Wolfe's good-faith attempt to get the facts right. What follows, though, is anything but straightforward, as Wolfe discovers Bix Beiderbecke to be at the heart of furious and ever-timely disputes over addiction, race and the origins of jazz, sex, and the influence of commerce on art. He also uncovers proof that the only newspaper interview Bix gave in his lifetime was a fraud, almost entirely plagiarized from several different sources. In fact, Wolfe comes to realize that the closer he seems to get to Bix, the more the legend retreats.", "title": "Finding Bix: The Life and Afterlife of a Jazz Legend", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32332615-finding-bix", "average": 3.36, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1482374425l/32332615.jpg", "reviews": 5, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16039623.Brendan_Wolfe", "name": "Brendan  Wolfe"}], "type": ["Music", "History", "Nonfiction", "Biography"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32332615-finding-bix", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34153686-mr-jefferson-s-telescope", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31426744-buckle-down", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20522555-man-in-the-moon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1618767.Healing"]}
