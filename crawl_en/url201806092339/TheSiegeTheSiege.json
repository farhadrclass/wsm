Ice broke loose from the compacted mass around the Strelka. Seagulls preened on the floes as the current swept them under bridges, and down the widening Neva to the sea.\nIt will end with Spring a year later, but by that time a large part of the Leningrad population will have died of cold or malnutrition, as the German armies hold the city in a relentless siege.Dunmore begins gently, almost lyrically, in a small dacha outside the city. Not that everyday life is easy. Her protagonist, 23-year-old Anna Mikhailova Levin, has had to abandon her studies as an artist to look after her baby brother Kolya, when her mother died in childbirth five years before. Her father, a writer, has been blacklisted by the Soviet Writers' Union, so Anna must work in a daycare nursery to support them, suffering under a boss whose strict adherence to socialist doctrines does not disguise her dislike of children. It is a period when nobody dare speak openly, for fear of denunciation and arrest. But Russia still has a pact with Germany and war seems far off.By the end of summer, all has changed. Germany invades Russia, and Leningrad is marked for destruction. The city's food warehouses are firebombed, its supply lines are cut, and strict food rationing is imposed. The citizens are mobilized to dig ditches, build defenses, work in factories, but slowly everything grinds to a halt; everyone now has one business only, survival. Anna holes up in a tiny apartment with Kolya, her father, and two others from outside the family: one is Marina Petrovna, a blacklisted actress and her father's old friend; the other, Andrei, is a young medical student, and Anna's first love. For love blooms against all odds; there may be little romance in two fully-dressed unwashed emaciated bodies huddling together for warmth, but there is something deeper: responsibility and caring. And the political climate changes also:\nWords are regaining their meanings, after years of masquerade. Hunger means hunger, terror means terror, enemy means enemy. It is not like trying to read mirror writing any more. Everything gets clearer day by day, as siege and winter eat into their lives. The coils of Soviet life are losing their strength. There's only the present left, and it has burned away both past and future.\nDunmore's ability to paint simultaneously a vast canvas and an intimate portrait has naturally been compared to Tolstoy. But as the situation worsens, many succumb to the inevitable, but others find an impossible will to survive, I though more of John Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath. Dunmore does not quite reach his spiritual transcendence, but she has the same deep belief in the human spirit. Spring does come, and the authorities find ways to get some food in and inhabitants out. The siege will continue for eighteen more months, but its grip has been loosened. The survivors have rediscovered their humanity.*The others I have read, in my personal order of preference, are: Zennor in Darkness, A Spell of Winter, and Talking to the Dead."}, {"userName": "Roman Clodia", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56111743-roman-clodia", "userReview": "...The Fuehrer has decided to have Leningrad wiped from the face of the earth.\nSuch a harrowing read as Dunmore gives us an insight into what it was like to live through the first winter of the siege of Leningrad. In another author's hands this might have been lush with romantic melodrama, but Dunmore keeps it clean and cold, allowing the details to speak for themselves: Kolya's childish whining as he cannot understand why he can't have another spoonful of precious hoarded jam; the quiet yet deep relationship between Anna and Andrei who fall in love in the most inauspicious of circumstances; the visceral cold as temperatures drop and water freezes in rooms with no power; the effect on human nature: the frightening competition for almost non-existent resources, the moments of compassion and friendship; the look and feel and smell of bodies slowly starving.

It's very effective; the grand descriptions of the land and the cold create a mythical world, and the straightforward lives of the Levin family make that world real and terrible. It was sometimes hard to read, especially while cradling my newborn baby, but so humanely observant that I couldn't put it down.Dunmore's writing--especially her verbs--astonished me throughout. I want to read everything she's written.

Another two characters (literally in a fable from the Napoleonic attack on Russia told by her father) and figuratively throughout are hunger and the winter.The book is mainly in the present tense which seems to fit well the immediacy of the story and the day-to-day (if not hour-to-hour nature of their existence and fight for survival). Anna is normally the main character (despite the book being written in the third person) so the occasional sections shifting to another character (in particular the passages switching to Pavlov - the logistical planner for Leningrad's hopelessly inadequate food supplies - can jar).Similarly as the siege takes hold and food supplies dwindle and almost disappear the book and characters close in on themselves and their appartment and on simple survival and the need for sustenance and this fits the author's terse but poetic writing style.A haunting tale which I found incredibly engrossing (at the time one of my very young children wasn't eating very well and I found it hard to not somehow think that this was a crucial matter of her health; also I was tired and felt reluctant to succumb to sleep because it might be like surrendering to the cold and not waking up again) as well as beautifully written. The story is extremely readable - easy to and best read in a few sittings.Some of the details are terrible - such as the baby opposite who dies of malnutrition from its young mother's inadvertent ignorance and neglect, the bodies left dead in houses (given the cold there and the impossibility of burial). The description of cold and hunger and its physical and psychological effects (with Andrei acting as an excuse to introduce scientific detail) are shocking but compelling.There are great reference to Russian literature (especially Pushkin), the author describes the Baltic seasons beautifully and gives a good insight into Stalinist Russia."}, {"userName": "Caroline Anna Bock", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3249157-caroline-anna-bock", "userReview": "Excellent historical novel, which opens in 1941 Leningrad at the precipice of the German invasion, is the story of Anna, an artist and her family and their survival in the siege.

It sat on the table and stared at me for four weeks. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to progress past the opening page on which there is a reproduction of the order from Nazi High Command for Leningrad (St Petersburg) to be wiped off the face of the earth. I had a feeling reading this one would take strength, and I was right.Obviously, any book which attempts to faithfully recreate an insider\u2019s experience of the siege of Leningrad isn\u2019t going to be sunshine and rainbows. But just how traumatic reading this book is, is testament to the tremendous skill of the writer. The descriptions of piercing cold and gnawing hunger are so powerful you find yourself turning the heating up and going in search of biscuits.Dunmore\u2019s research must have been painstaking to recreate the Leningrad of the time so effectively. And I imagine reading first-hand survivor accounts of the conditions inside the city couldn\u2019t have been easy.The author also deserves praise for bringing such an important story to my attention because, apart from some vague recollections of hearing it mentioned, it\u2019s part of WWII history which managed to slip past me. I don\u2019t think we covered this in school, even though 1.5 million people died in Leningrad in the winter of 1941.Overall: powerful and moving, with brilliant descriptions and complex characters. Although, as you\u2019d expect, this is also a bleak read only to be approached if you think you can stomach it."}, {"userName": "Craig", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5967953-craig", "userReview": "Odd to be reading this book when the radio is reporting women and children starving in the besieged Syrian town of Madaya. We never learn the lessons of history.This book tells the story of another siege. That of Leningrad in 1941. It was encircled by the invading German army for an incredible three years during the second world war. The book tells the story of the Levin family. Principally 23 year old Anna, who has to care for her wounded and enfeebled father Mikhail, and her 5 year old brother Kolya. As the siege gradually takes hold they retreat from their well stocked country dacha to a two roomed apartment in the city. They are joined there by Anna's lover Andrei and her father's former lover Marina. They must survive the freezing and brutal winter of 1941, dodging shells, incendiaries and bombs, and living on just two meagre slices of bread per day.The book is really Anna's story. It is her strength that will pull her family through. She has already sacrificed her own future to care for her young brother after their mother dies and now she gives up her own rations and strength to go out and forage for food and fuel day after day. It is a story of defiance, love and the human spirit in the most awful of circumstances. I could feel the chill and the hunger sinking into my bones with every page I turned and it is hard not to speculate how you yourself would cope in such dire and straitened conditions. The descriptions of the empty and ice bound, eerie city streets, littered with bodies and hiding the threat of menace around every corner are haunting. Fights break out over the smallest crust of bread or scrap of wood for the fire. People are living like this right now, in this century. It is a hard thought to tally.An intense and sobering read."}, {"userName": "Michele Brenton", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3149325-michele-brenton", "userReview": "I've been given this as a book club read. I've read the first chapter and I am distinctly unimpressed.I don't like books that break the fourth wall. It annoys me, destroys the illusion and makes me feel patronised. It was bad enough when Enid Blyton did it - but I can't stomach it in an adult read unless it is done for comedic effect or it is a memoir/first person narrative and the writer is speaking in real time. I can't accept it in a piece of work firmly set in the 1940s.This single sentence on the blurb on the back rang warning bells for me: \"They will soon discover what it is like to be so hungry you boil shoe leather to make soup, so cold you burn furniture and books.\" I know what that means to say but what it actually says to me is that they are going to find out that when they get hungry I will be caused to do something!!!This is the kind of thing that grates on me like squeaky chalk on a blackboard but I gave it the benefit of the doubt as often writers don't get the choice of what goes on the back of their books.I will give it more of a go and hope it improves.

Given its subject matter, it's hard for me to say that I enjoyed this book. I certainly found it interesting and very well written. Dunmore intensely evokes the horror of the circumstances of people in Leningrad in 1941. And in this respect, it is essentially a book about hunger; how hunger and starvation defined every moment and feeling of the characters in that time and place. The writing even simulates the lightheadedness, disjointed thinking and hallucinations that come with starvation. Having said this, given the dreariness of the subject matter, it is definitely not a book for everyone."}, {"userName": "Steven Z.", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17428284-steven-z", "userReview": "On June 22, 1941 Adolf Hitler unleashed Operation Barbarossa against the Soviet Union. The Germans surprised the Russians who suffered enormous casualties and retreated into the interior. The Russians had been warned by the British of Nazi intentions, but Joseph Stalin ignored the British, reasoning that London wanted to create another front in its war against Germany. Stalin did expect Hitler to break the Nazi-Soviet Pact of August, 1939 but he believed he had more time to prepare. Stalin was in such shock as German troops marched through Russia that he disappeared for ten days, probably fearing that why would the Russian people support a murdering dictator, but the reality was that Stalin, was their murdering dictator and Hitler was not! The support for Stalin and the \u201cRussian Motherland\u201d emerges in Helen Dunmore\u2019s novel, THE SIEGE which takes place during the siege of Leningrad that lasted from September 1941 to 1944. As New York Times reporter, Harrison Salisbury labeled the events in Leningrad, \u201cThe 900 Days,\u201d the title of his book about the city that suffered the death of over 650,000 people. Dunmore\u2019s novel provides insight into the lives of every day Russians as they struggled through starvation, fear of German artillery shells and bombs, the lack of any bureaucratic relief by city officials, and the constant paranoia that they could not trust their own government. The reader is presented with a number of characters; the family of Anna, her younger brother Kolya who she raises after her mother died in child birth, and her father Mikhail, a writer and poet who has been rejected by the Soviet Writers Union because he has not adapted to the tenets of socialist realism, and Marina, an aging actress who comes to live with them. We are also exposed to Andrei; a young doctor who reports the horrors of the siege from Leningrad\u2019s remaining hospitals, and other characters like Dimitri Pavlov, who is sent from Moscow to address the city\u2019s food shortages. Pavlov realizes that Leningrad, a city mostly of islands, similar to Stockholm, is now a \u201cstone island,\u201d and \u201chas got to depend upon its own resources\u201d to survive. (198) what are those negligible resources? A government ukase suggests the nutritional value of wallpaper paste that once boiled can provide sustenance for those who are starving. The story is set when Mikhail\u2019s wife Vera dies in childbirth, thrusting motherhood on her daughter Anna before the German invasion. The paranoia of Stalin\u2019s Russia before the arrival of the Germans is readily apparent from the outset of the book. Anna, a nursery school teacher assistant, fears raising her voice at work as Kolya is play acting the Russian Civil War between the White and Red soldiers because she might be heard by her boss who she fears will denounce her. The Great Terror of the 1930s is in the air as it seems everyone is afraid that someone will denounce them to the authorities. Stalin has warned his people that \u201cwreckers, traitors, enemies, and saboteurs\u2026.had infiltrated the Party itself, and were among the elite, masking themselves as irreproachable Party activists and committee members. But how could you ever prove it wasn\u2019t a mask, Anna wonders. Only by ripping off your own flesh\u2026\u201d (21)Dunmore provides a description of how Leningraders attempted to deal with the German advance through Anna\u2019s eyes as she works on digging trenches and tank traps. The bombing of food warehouses and Leningrad\u2019s geographical isolation make any defensive preparations useless in dealing with the siege. Leningrad\u2019s citizens are urbanites who only know how to forage for food by queuing up at food centers, not by using what the earth provides. One might ask why Leningraders were able to survive as well as they did, probably because they had experience of starvation in the 1930s when Stalin\u2019s collectivization policies created the lack of food. In a way Stalinist agricultural policies might be considered somewhat normal in the minds of Soviet citizens. The queuing before the war for food and goods created a mentality that was put to good use during the siege and created the false hope that food would soon be available. Leningrad\u2019s main problem was its \u201cimpossible arithmetic\u201d for a city with 3.5 million people with little food resources other than wallpaper paste and boiling leather to obtain fluid to make soup. Leningrad is a city of \u201ca million flailing hands\u201d as people constantly reach for food. (146)To best understand Leningrad\u2019s plight I would recommend that the reader place a map of Leningrad in front of them to understand how difficult it was to supply the city. Lake Ladoga to the east was useful once it froze during the winter months, but the Germans made it very hazardous for any truck convoys as they continued to bomb the ice. The result is the grim process of the black market that Anna has to deal with to obtain anything. People become animals as they try to survive. In a way the best means of survival is sleep because it provides an escape from hunger. As Anna points out \u201cyou should never wake anyone once they\u2019ve gotten away, deep into their dreams, where there is food.\u201d (189)The relationship between Anna and Andrei is a tender one that is developed nicely by the author. Considering the conditions one would think that love would have difficulty flourishing, but in this instance Anna and Andrei\u2019s needs are such that their relationship becomes a life line for survival. Having survived the winter of 1941-1942, Leningraders were greeted by spring and improved food rations and supplies. Dunmore describes the scenes of people planting vegetables in city parks and the optimism that those who were still alive would survive the German siege. Dunmore leaves the reader in the spring of 1942, but for the remaining population of Leningrad the war would continue for two more years. If you find the time to read THE SIEGE, Dunmore\u2019s sequel THE BETRAYAL will not disappoint. If you are interested in the history of the siege of Leningrad I would recommend Michael Jones\u2019 LENINGRAD: STATE OF SIEGE"}, {"userName": "Chris Demer", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5619631-chris-demer", "userReview": "This is a wonderful story of love amid deprivation and war during the siege of Leningrad.

I don't think I've read anything set in Russia during this time before (or at least not wholly based in Russia) so I was glad to expand my horizons a little. I must admit just recently I've not had much luck with these types of books, often finding myself disappointed, and I was hoping The Siege would be different. However I can't say I really felt that engaged most of the time. Undoubtedly the writing is good- there is a certain poetry to it, but it does not really feel as though you get under the character's skin. A lot of the time I found the writing kind of detached. The descriptions of what was going on were very good, I could see what was happening in my mind quite clearly, and at times that made it difficult to read. However I never really got a sense of how the characters felt about what was going on- even when there was a sense of feeling it was described in such a detached way that it felt as much like fact as like feeling. If it was purposeful then I suppose it showed the detachment the characters may crave very clearly but for me it felt like that characters were pretty one dementional. As far as being a war novel it didn't really feel like a war novel, there was some speak of the enemy but it felt almost as if it could be set anywhere in Soviet Russia during food shortages.I found the end was very rushed, almost as if Dunmore wasn't sure how to get to the end so decided just to skip a great chunk of time. Similarly I found that anticipated events, while could have really added emotion were skipped over only to be mentioned later so you know they had happened. I found when it ended a little confusing to, but maybe if I had some prior knowledge of the events of the Leningrad siege I would have known what happened next anyway.The ending however was kind of poignant and probably the best section emotionally, it sort of made me want to visit St. Petersberg3.5/5"}, {"userName": "James Murphy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2422285-james-murphy", "userReview": "Helen Dunmore is quite the writer and has written a fine novel in The Siege. It's a novel of a group of characters caught up in the hard siege of Leningrad during the first terrible winter of 1941-42. Though a reader of military history, I know next to nothing about the German investment of the city except that it apparently lasted for, as Harrison Salisbury famously related, 900 days. But Dunmore seems to me to have it right. Her novel depicts what must have been the darkest of those days before the Soviets were able to open supply routes into the city across frozen Lake Ladoga. So Dunmore's characters experience starvation and the harsh cold of that deep winter. She writes very well about the exhaustion of those empty of food but full of fear, about how hunger ages and sharpens the physical appearance. I thought her raw depiction of the desperation these characters sink into very well written, touchingly real. I admired her control of the novel. A family's at the heart of it, a family in stress during desperate times of food and fuel shortages and constantly in danger from German shelling and from those in the same extreme need who'd resort to violence for a few grams of food or a few sticks of firewood. The Siege could've easily skidded into melodrama but Dunmore reported personal losses indirectly while pushing strength and spirit forward, realistically tinged with cynicism. It's finely written that way. And it's beautiful on the page and in the mind, too. When she writes phrases like iron nights the bombers love or bees booming in the blossoms you instantly envisage what she describes.

When the siege begins, Anna is a young nursery school assistant who's been robbed of a career in the arts (and saddled with a dependent 5-year-old brother) by the premature death of her mother. We meet her, and her father and brother, just before the siege, when they're growing vegetables at their dacha and feeling relatively stable, even if Anna's writer father has been classed as too much of an independent thinker in Stalin's Russia. As the siege progresses and people begin to die in the hundreds of thousands during a frigid winter, the tension mounts -- Anna and her boyfriend seem sure they'll survive, but will they? And what about Kolya, the 5-year-old who's so emaciated he can hardly muster the energy to play with his few toys? Dunmore's writing is spare and elegant, and in addition to the micro-details of Anna's life she pulls back to show us glimpses of other lives, from a tank driver who's navigating the ice road across Lake Ladoga with vital supplies, to the commander who has to make the key decisions of how to deploy food supplies.

It can serve as a companion piece to Anna Reid's more recent nonfiction account of the siege of Leningrad (\"Leningrad: The Epic Siege of World War II, 1941-1944\"). I was not only impressed by the beauty of Dunmore's prose, particularly in her depiction of the city of St. Petersburg/Leningrad itself, but also by her ability to weave an astonishing amount of historical research into her narrative, seamlessly and accurately. Dunmore is obviously a connoisseur of Russian culture and literature, and moreover at home with the Russian language (the bibliography at the end lists primary sources in Russian along with the usual English-language secondary sources). As a result this novel suffers from none of the embarrassing mistakes in language usage or facts that so often plague English-language novels about Russia. It also demonstrates an unusual sensitivity to and respect for its difficult subject matter. Some readers will find the novel \"slow,\" perhaps because Dunmore does not sensationalize. My only (purely aesthetic) criticism is that the novel's transition from the initial invasion of the Soviet Union by the Nazis in June 1941 to the starvation they imposed upon Leningrad's population beginning in the autumn of the same year seems somewhat abrupt."}, {"userName": "Peter Upton", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57424462-peter-upton", "userReview": "A beautifully written book that had me riveted from page one. Set initially in pre war Leningrad where Stalin's purges of the population are running amok and everyone is terrified of their own shadow and especially of the incautious word that will result in the early morning knock on their door and the trip in the black van from which they know they will never return. The book then moves on to the German invasion and the siege of Leningrad. If you really want to know what it is like to live on just 125 grams of bread a day (two thin slices) in an unheated apartment while the temperature plummets past minus 18 degrees and the dead lay frozen next to you read this superb book."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5013497-mark", "userReview": "\u201c A ring of siege grips the city. Nothing comes in, nothing goes out. And in the suburbs, within sight, the Germans have dug themselves in\u2026There they squat in the outskirts of Leningrad, like wolves at the mouth of a cave.\u201dAgainst this forbidding backdrop, is a tale of love and survival. The strength of family and of boundless determination. We follow Anna, a young nursery teacher, her father, a black-listed writer and her much younger brother, struggling to live in a cramped apartment, with dwindling food and an oncoming winter, which in this region is relentlessly brutal.This sounds incredibly bleak, and at times it is, but in the hands of this talented author, she drives the story along, with a strong dose of hope and courage, along with simple but elegant prose. It is also meticulously researched, placing the reader firmly into this beleaguered landscape. I have now been introduced to another amazing writer.

This is an incredible story. Anna, a 22 year old woman, strives to keep her father, her father's former lover, and her brother alive during the siege of Leningrad in 1941. I don't think that I need to give the whole story away. Thousands of people starved during that first winter when the city was cut off by the German army.Outside of the horrors that the citizens of Leningrad endured, Dunmore's writing is clear and precise. She tells the story without sentimentality while carrying you along as you are riveted by both the story and the prose. Follow up with the sequel, \"The Betrayal\"The Betrayal.

This one was no different. I found the story of the siege of Leningrad really interesting. There is no doubt that it is one aspect of World War II which I didn't know a great deal about. The characters were good and the tension which builds over that long winter of 1941/42 was compelling. But I found the ending was a bit of a damp squib. A pity, really as it is always nice to read historical fiction set in an unusual place and through events little written about."}, {"userName": "Tom", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1375149-tom", "userReview": "Read it in summer.Very interesting (chick-flick) viewpoint on the horrendous siege of Leningrad.

Which is just as well really because if you're looking for a page-turner, this isn't it - at least not in the conventional sense of the word. Unlike the snow, action is fairly thin on the ground, but it's not action that makes for this novel. The immersive, claustrophobic, nature of the writing draws you into a small room with five occupants in a starving Leningrad winter.In fact, although the book is entitled The Siege, the besiegers barely make an appearance. Shells are heard but this is not London in the blitz. The Germans are peripheral enemies compared to the tyrants of cold and hunger. Dunmore wisely keeps the characters to a minimum heightening the sense of isolation.The ending is rather abrupt, which makes some sense from a plot point of view, though I thought there could have been a link chapter between the penultimate and final chapters."}, {"userName": "Jack Baillot", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6153511-jack-baillot", "userReview": "8-("}, {"userName": "epg", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2688077-epg", "userReview": "Well, even though the population of a city is slowly starved and/or frozen to death (that is, those who have not already been shot or had a bomb dropped on them), this story is a celebration of life. I left this book feeling uplifted.To begin with, the suffering feels real, it feels painful, and that\u2019s why one can only come away from this book feeling appreciative of all that we take for granted. Having groceries in the fridge is the most obvious one, but there are also the basics like our desire to live, to survive, which we come to understand is actually not as foolproof as we\u2019d like to think. In contrast, the text also draws our attention to that which we can count on, that which life generously offers us, such as the purity of a first snowfall or the guarantee of the coming of spring.I was quite intrigued by the first couple of pages but then didn\u2019t get into the story before many chapters in. Indeed, I almost gave up on the book several times. I think it was mostly the sort of oppressive atmosphere and the, what I find to be, jagged rhythm of the writing style that took a bit of getting used to. I was also turned off by the crude bits of the earlier chapters - too early on for me to have been sufficiently swept along by the story to just ignore them.However, by maybe a third of the way in, I found myself quite caught up in the storyline and characters and moved by the intense themes. I admired what I felt to be a personal and honest portrayal of the main character and enjoyed the vivid imagery sprinkled throughout. Also I thought the use of the \u2018exterior\u2019 characters like the sterile bureaucrat, who counted each gram of the food rations as coldly as he counted the resulting dead, was effectively unsettling. One of the reviews on the back cover of the book says \u201c\u2026a background of suffering so intimately reconstructed, it is hard to believe that Dunmore was not there\u201d. I too praise how she creates such a convincing scenario - successfully puts us right into what feels like real moments of this terrible period. I could feel the cold. I could feel the weakness. I could imagine the desire for food leaving me for want of fulfillment and I could picture myself slipping into a sort of instinctual survival mode, but wondering just how long mine would have held out. And indeed it was interesting to learn about this horrendous historical event, the sort of trial most of us will never have to face.So, this book turned out to be a recommendable read after all \u2013 moving and thought provoking. I take away from it a handful of powerful quotes \u2026 and of course a new gratitude for the food on my plate.\u201cTheir faces were dark with the resentment we feel towards those we are about to injure.\u201d\u201cMemory curled inside Anna like smoke, making shapes she didn\u2019t want to recognize.\u201d\u201cOther people have lives, but we just keep on having emotions.\u201d\u201cThe trees are lit up like candelabra by the whiteness they hold in their arms.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t value yourself, and that belittles everyone who loves you.\u201d\u201cYou know you\u2019re changing, but you still think you can find the way back to what you used to be. Then one day you know you can\u2019t.\u201d\u201cSome people don\u2019t have it in them, and they just fade away.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s been holding hands with the dead, and you mustn\u2019t do that. You must let go straight away, as soon as they touch you.\u201d"}], "description": "Called \"elegantly, starkly beautiful\" by The New York Times Book Review, The Siege is Helen Dunmore's masterpiece. Her canvas is monumental -- the Nazis' 1941 winter siege on Leningrad that killed six hundred thousand -- but her focus is heartrendingly intimate. One family, the Levins, fights to stay alive in their small apartment, held together by the unlikely courage and resourcefulness of twenty-two-year-old Anna. Though she dreams of an artist's life, she must instead forage for food in the ever more desperate city and watch her little brother grow cruelly thin. Their father, a blacklisted writer who once advocated a robust life of the mind, withers in spirit and body. At such brutal times everything is tested. And yet Dunmore's inspiring story shows that even then, the triumph of the human heart is that love need not fall away.", "title": "The Siege\n      \n          (The Siege #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/469959.The_Siege", "average": 4.0, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327918575l/469959.jpg", "reviews": 353, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/41542.Helen_Dunmore", "name": "Helen Dunmore"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fiction", "Cultural", "War", "War"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/469959.The_Siege", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33632603-the-siege", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10826951-the-siege", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3106553-the-siege", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/469965.The_Siege", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1022657.Ingo", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/469954.Tide_Knot", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1007458.The_Deep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2580514-the-crossing-of-ingo", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25613408-exposure"]}
