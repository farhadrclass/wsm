Sandman was just one of those reading experiences, where you can't wait to find out what happens next but you're worried that you'll finish it too soon. It's been a while that I read a book where I was completely immersed in a new world, so much so that I wish I didn't have to go back to mine! I'm not much of a graphic novel reader so I didn't expect to have this reaction with Sandman but I was totally wrong. Gaiman really shows the depth of his imagination, as well as his skill as a storyteller, and he's definitely on my list of favourite writers for coming up with this beauty. Speaking of beauty, Dave McKean's covers are to die for. As for the books, the Absolute editions are totally worth the money. The print is amazing and the books themselves are gorgeous."}, {"userName": "Vasilis Manias", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17767813-vasilis-manias", "userReview": "\u03a3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd 4\u03bf \u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf \u03b4\u03b5 \u03c7\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03ac\u03b6\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2, \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03b1\u03c6\u03b9\u03b5\u03c1\u03ce\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03b5 \u03c7\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03b5 \u03ba\u03ac\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b1, \u03cc\u03bb\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b9\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1 \u03ba\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03b1\u03af\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b7\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7 \u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03ba\u03b9\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u039f\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd, \u03bf\u03b9 \u03c3\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03bc\u03bc\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b1\u03b9\u03b5\u03c2 \u03be\u03b5\u03c7\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 \u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b5\u03c2, \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03cd\u03b8\u03b9\u03b1 \u03b5\u03ba\u03b4\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2, \u03b1\u03c0\u03ce\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b5\u03bb\u03c0\u03af\u03b4\u03b1\u03c2, \u03c4\u03af\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b1 \u03b4\u03b5 \u03bc\u03bf\u03b9\u03ac\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf, \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b5 \u03b2\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03b1\u03c0\u03c5\u03c1\u03cc\u03b2\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf, \u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c3\u03b5 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03c5\u03c4\u03b7 \u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03c1\u03ce\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b5\u03c5\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u03c4\u03bf \u03c0\u03b1\u03b6\u03bb \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5 \u0392\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 Destiny.\u0391\u03bb\u03ae\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1: How would you feel about Life if Death was your older sister?"}, {"userName": "Petra", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29468362-petra", "userReview": "\"Ka\u017ee\u0161 da snovi ovdje nemaju mo\u0107?

Ipak, ne\u0161to moram napisati iz nekoliko razloga:1) impresionirana sam do neba i natrag2) nisam dugo zbog ne\u010dega osjetila tako \u0161irok spektar emocija3) Orbi (koju obo\u017eavam jer me uvela u strip) \u0107e me golim rukama zadaviti ne iza\u0111e li osvrt na sunce (hvala ti \u0161to si strpljivo \u010ditala bombe od mojih poruka ovih tjedan i ne\u0161to dana). Dakle... \u0161to re\u0107i o savr\u0161enstvu modernog stripa? Za po\u010detak neka se zna da je Neil Gaiman genijalac i da ja djeli\u0107em sebe vjerujem da ga je sam Morfej obdario tako da mo\u017ee ispri\u010dati njegovu pri\u010du. Od tog \u010dovjeka sam pro\u010ditala sva\u0161ta i mogu re\u0107i da me u \u017eivotu nije razo\u010darao i da bi sve dala samo da mogu s njim popiti kavu na sat vremena, jer \u017eelim svjedo\u010diti takvom toku misli i ideja. Sljede\u0107e, majstor je za pletenje kompliciranih mre\u017ea pri\u010da, doga\u0111aja, mjesta i vremena, jer rijetki ovoliko u detalje sla\u017eu si\u0107u\u0161ne \u010destice kako bi dobili mrcinu. Ve\u0107ina bi neboder napravila od cigli i betona. Neil Gaiman ih radi od pijeska, zrnce po zrnce. Sve ima svoje mjesto, prekrasnu svrhu i ni\u0161ta nije u pri\u010di kako bi ispunilo prazan prostor.  Svi\u0111a mi se \u0161to niti jedna najmanja osoba nije alat kojim bi San sebe popravio, ili pouka iz koje bi San ne\u0161to nau\u010dio. On u\u010di od njih, i oni od njega, ali oni imaju svoje puteve, \u017eivote, odluke i planove. O njemu ne ovise i on ih ne stvara. Koliko god strip bio fantasti\u010dan, toliko je realisti\u010dan. Nitko se ne mo\u017ee potpuno promijeniti, ve\u0107 sve ima svoje granice. Nije grijeh odati se o\u010daju, iako je najbolje, i najte\u017ee nastaviti \u017eivjeti, lo\u0161e stvari se ne doga\u0111aju samo zato da bismo iz njih ne\u0161to nau\u010dili, ali naravno da mo\u017eemo i ho\u0107emo, i neki ljudi ne\u0107e sve pre\u017eivjeti, niti se to od njih o\u010dekuje.  Svi\u0111aju mi se likovi. Svidio mi se San, Morfej, Kralj snova, sa svojom metlom u guzici i neudobnosti koju osje\u0107a kad ne zna \u0161to \u0107e sa samim sobom u nekim situacijama. Svidjela mi se njegova vje\u010dna pristojnost, logi\u010dnost razmi\u0161ljanja, sposobnost da prihvati, prizna i ispravi, suptilna, ali duboka ljubav, i konstantni, nezamjenjivi osje\u0107aj du\u017enosti koji ga vodi kroz \u017eivot. Svidjela mi se Smrt, Teleuta, zbog svoje ljubavi prema svakom \u017eivom bi\u0107u, strpljivosti i \u017eelji da im pomogne i povede ih tamo gdje trebaju i\u0107i. Volim odnos izme\u0111u nje i Sna, i kontrast, gdje je San toliko stra\u0161an i hladan, a Smrt vesela i topla. Divna bratska ljubav. Smutnja je bila preslatka i cudna, Slom sam htjela zagrliti, a Strasti bi neke stvari voljela objasniti, iako znam da protiv svoje prirode ne mo\u017ee.  Velika ve\u0107ina likova mi se jako svidjela na razli\u010dite na\u010dine, i svi\u0111a mi se \u0161to sam sva\u010dije motive i razloge mogla razumjeti, iako se s nekima nisam slagala. Svi su kompleksni, s bogatim unutarnjim svjetovima i stvarnim emocijama. Volim koli\u010dinu socijalne razli\u010ditosti u samom stripu. Stvarno nije nedostajalo LGBT zajednice, ljudi svih boja ko\u017ee, ljudi razli\u010ditih religija, kultura, i sausage fest nije postojao. Zahvalna sam na progresivnosti i liberalnosti, pa mi je iskustvo \u010ditanja stripa bilo jo\u0161 divnije.  E, da, jo\u0161 jedan dokaz Gaimanove genijalnosti su silne reference na poznate povijesne li\u010dnosti, doga\u0111aje i brojne mitologije. Na neke epizode nisam mogla sebi do\u0107i od na\u010dina na koji je sve smi\u0161ljeno.  \u0160to se stilova crtanja ti\u010de, prvo mi je bilo malo \u010dudno koliko razli\u010ditih stilova ima, ali vrlo brzo sam to po\u010dela cijeniti i svi su prekrasni. Zjenice su mi se \u0161irile na one esteti\u010dne, zagasite scene s no\u0107nim nebom, ili pak one crno-bijelo-sivo-tamnoplave. Neke panele bi se dalo uokviriti i staviti u galeriju.  Na ovaj strip sam lijevala suze kao iz kabla, umirala od smijeha, kasnila na buseve kako bih pro\u010ditala jo\u0161 koju stranicu, zapostavljala obaveze kako bih u\u010dinila isto, zurila u jedne te iste sli\u010dice raznje\u017eena, u \u0161oku, iznena\u0111ena, impresionirana ili ne\u0161to pedeseto. Ovih dana 95% moga mozga \u010dini Sandman, i lagala bih kad bih rekla da ne pro\u0111em svaki dan kroz sve \u010detiri divovske knji\u017eurine samo da jo\u0161 jednom pro\u010ditam svoje najdra\u017ee scene. Zajedno s likovima sam bila frustrirana, sretna, napeta, i prolazila ono putovanje od sto upitnika prema odgovorima. Tu\u017ean \u0107e biti dan kad \u0107u ih morati vratiti u knji\u017enicu (ili Orbi, koja \u0107e mi dodu\u0161e oprostiti zadr\u017eim li prvi dio jo\u0161 neko vrijeme)... Pa, vjerojatno imam jo\u0161 puno za re\u0107i, ali \u010dini mi se da sam prekrda\u0161ila 1500 rije\u010di, pa \u0107u ra\u0111e samo oka\u010diti neke quotove koji su mi se svidjeli i pomiriti se s \u010dinjenicom da vi\u0161e ne\u0107e ni\u0161ta novo iza\u0107i iz serijala. Pitam se \u0161to je to s \u010dovje\u010danstvom. Tako se \u010dudno odnose prema daru moje sestre. Za\u0161to se boje svijeta bez Sunca? Umrijeti je prirodno kao i roditi se. Ali nje se boje. U\u017easnuti su. Slaba\u0161no se trude umilostiviti je. Ne vole je. Prije mnogo tisu\u0107a godina u snu sam \u010duo pjesmu smrtnika koja je slavila njezin dar. Jo\u0161 je se sje\u0107am. \"Smrt sada stoji preda mnom: Kao oporavak bolesnika, kao \u0161etnja vrtom nakon bolesti. [\u2026] Taj je zaboravljeni pjesnik razumio njezine darove.

I got up at five this morning and came downstairs to finish it. The house was dark and I didn't turn on the light in the living room because I didn't want to disturb the dog, so I felt my way down the stairs in my stockinged feet. The door into the bedroom opened and closed behind me, and I stopped, and waited. 'Hello?' I said. 'Daddy,' said a sleepy six-year-old voice right behind me I wasn't mad keen on the idea of a sleepy six year old going down the stairs in the pitch black of an early winter morning, but I couldn't go past him to get to the light and leave him alone, so together we went slowly downwards in our stockinged feet. Nicky sat at one end of the table while I filled the kettle and prepared the porridge and made my coffee, then I sat down at the other end with my pot of coffee and a cup and Sandman volume four. 'We must be very quiet,' said Nicky. 'We mustn't make any noise or we will wake Martin and he will be cross.'Martin's a sort of lodger. He's very nice and I don't think he'd get cross, but Nicky was right, we must be very quiet.I started to read.I think Neil Gaiman wrote at night a lot, so it felt appropriate to be reading this at five in the morning. There wasn't a storm lashing the windows with wind and rain, though I noticed later it was foggy, but that was later. I didn't notice Nicky go back upstairs. I was vaguely aware of Eddie getting up and moving around upstairs. I didn't notice the morning getting brighter, dimming the glare of the lights. At some various I did stir the porridge and turn the heat up and yell at the boys to come down and eat and for Eddie to walk the dog and I left the table long enough to take Annemarie's up on a tray and made some Van Morrison jokes. ('Have I told you lately that I love you?''Yes, but you haven't told me there's no-one above me.''...can't remember what comes next.''I fill your bowl with porridge? Take away your.... bowl... with no more porridge?''You make my breakfast that's what you do.')Breakfast runs automatically now, and nothing spoils a morning read like burnt porridge. So I finished it. I didn't want it to finish, but it did. Poor Lyta Hall. Poor Dream. Poor Clara. Poor everyone. It really was all about death, wasn't it? The story resolves in The Kindly Ones, but the real emotional climax is The Wake. Death and grief and loss and mourning and then waking up and moving on as best you can. (At some point Eddie sat down to eat his breakfast and said: 'Oh, there's a hair in my porridge. Good thing it isn't a rabbit. Eh? Eh?')I seem to remember Marc Hempel's art not being popular with everyone. I may have been unsure of it myself at first, but God, it's amazing. And Mike Zulli on the wake, and John J Muth and then holy moley Charles Vess reprising older, wiser, sadder Shakespeare in The Tempest. The unresolved mystery of who Puck and Loki were really working for lingers. None of my own theories really fit properly, and I guess I appreciate leaving one thing unknown and possibly unknowable to haunt and nag the reader. I do hope it has a solution though - if there was no solution to the mystery, even if we never discover what it is, that would be a cheat.I think reading The Sandman may have been the one thing I ever did that was cool, and I didn't do it because it was cool, I did it because I loved it, and it became cool for a while. I'm not sure anyone noticed me doing this cool thing while it was cool, but maybe that's what's cool about it. I still have Overture to read, which I'll get to tonight, and then there's assorted extras like The Dream Hunters and the Death collection and Books Of Magic, which is only vaguely related, which I'll get to eventually. At some point I might try to write something about the whole series from beginning to end, but not now, which is why this review is mostly about me going downstairs in the dark in my stockings with my six year old son behind me like a little familiar spirit. I can go back and read Sandman again, but moments like that come and go, and I'd like to be able to recall it long after it would be forgotten if I hadn't written it here.

This was one of the very best ends to a series ever, as much as I didn't want it to end. Really masterful and surprisingly satisfying. The two story arcs, The Kindly Ones and The Wake, were perfect. It left me feeling OK with the ending instead of depressed that it was over, quite a feat. The extra pieces that were included at the end were OK. I think they included them because if you're collecting the entire Absolute everything of the series they need to actually include everything at some point, and the fifth volume would too huge with all of that in there, and this one would have seemed too small without some additional stuff included. But it would have been more effective to just end with the end of The Wake, the other stuff was a distraction. That wasn't important though. The reason I took a star off was because I didn't like the art in a most of the book. Hempel and Disraeli weren't my cup of tea. The characters were flat, not expressive, looked juvenile. I'm not going to go on and on about something that came out that long ago, but I didn't enjoy it. And the colors were off too.

I did not grieve, in the sense of experiencing feelings of sadness. But I did ponder the journey of this character and my relationship with him and his world. When I began reading The Sandman a couple of years ago, I did so with great anticipation for this most highly lauded of continuing comics stories. With the first two volumes, I could see how far the creators were reaching. With so much good said about the series, I was sure that before the end, they would surely grasp that for which they reached. If so, I was experiencing the great potential of the story as I began it, even if I never felt that the book was truly reaching it. Now I close the back cover over the final page of this epic, which I finished in a third of the time it originally took to be published. With these final two collected stories, I believe that Gaiman and his collaborators came the closest to attaining the great heights for which they reached in this highly ambitious tale. Of all that I read in the series, this was my favourite. Still, I do not believe that the book ever fully succeeded at everything it intended to do. Now, when I consider my thoughts on a book, I try to rate it in its own context. Therefore, I may rate a piece of grocery store pulp fiction as highly as a book by Steinbeck. But this does not make the two equal. So, this may be the height of Sandman's story, here as the story ends, and I may find it imperfect. But for a book that aimed so high, even to not reach that height, it still soars higher than most. These final chapters of the story of The Sandman, Morpheus, The Dream Lord of The Endless, deal with death, and loss, and change, and the cycle of life. Morpheus has come around over the first more than fifty issues of his episodic tale, and now knows his limits in a way he did not at the beginning. He understands consequences to his actions, even in the world of dreams, that he did not know when we first met him. The arc is satisfying. Now, he must die in order to change. A new Dream Lord, who is still the Dream Lord, must continue past him. In his passing, we have opportunity to visit many of the characters whom he touched over the run of the entire series. Members of his family, The Endless, are given voice, as are most everyone else we have met of any significance. Since the wake for Morpheus occurs in the Dream World, and all who dream are invited, the reader is also present. My own experience reading these pages is that I did feel as though I had entered the book, and was experiencing the wake with these other characters, in ways I have never before felt so immersed in a comic. It was very well done, and quite moving. My complaint with this book, though less than any before it, is with the art. Unfortunately it took until Book 8 for me to realize that there are \"remastered\" versions of all of The Sandman volumes. Some that I read were these recoloured versions. Some were not. I cannot know if I would have enjoyed the entire series more from the very beginning if I had been reading these updated versions. As it was, and is, I have struggled to penetrate the illustrations in this series from the very beginning. There were times when I felt I was simply enduring it, art that was actually ugly to look at. When the art was so bad that I couldn't enjoy looking at the pages, how could it not completely obfuscate the meaning and tone and flow of the story it portrayed? This is a collaborative medium. If plot, character, and world are all gorgeously rendered in script, but sloppily presented, I cannot call the finished product good. That said, this last collection was the most beautiful, and the most consistent, of the entire series. I never prefer to read any series with a rotation of illustrators, especially when they change in the middle of stories, as they often did in this long running limited series. But in this final collection, we have fewer artists, who are used in such a way as to not interrupt the flow of the narrative. This I appreciated. The illustrations for The Wake were actually my favourite of the entire series. Were I given opportunity to read again from the beginning with this illustrator only, I would read the entire series again, and maybe have a better experience. I recognize that The Sandman broke serious ground in the world of comics. We're it not for The Sandman, perhaps we would not have books like Saga today. After extremely heavily plotted books such as The Watchmen by Alan Moore, and violence and pessimism were turned way up in books like Frank Millers The Dark Knight Returns, it is nice that the next wave of \"adult\" comics contained something as thoughtful and feminine and mysterious and creative as The Sandman. It needed to be. When I read it and consider the teenager I was when it was released, I know that that young man would have loved this series, had he discovered it on the shelf when it was first being published. It would have been good for me. The explorations of gender and sexuality, and the relationships of life and longing and death and expression were exactly where I lived as a sad, black-clad, nail-polish-wearing teen in the nineties. But it isn't the nineties anymore. And I can appreciate everything that The Sandman gave us so that I can enjoy Monstress today without having to pretend that it is as perfect a book as everyone says. Even Neil Gaiman has improved as a writer since this series was first published. Much that I am enjoying as I read American Gods can be found in the pages of this comic, in a lesser form. I still prefer the greater form. My absolute favourite thing about this entire series has been the covers and the design by Dave McKean. It does not surprise me a whit that this book was so collectable in single issues when it was first on the shelves. These covers are true things of beauty. For all the harm that was done to the story in the inconsistency of art within, the consistency of these designs on the covers must have helped ameliorate the damage in the original floppies. Had I seen these books on the top shelves of my local comics shop when I was in high school, rather than being distracted as I was by Spider-Man's clone saga, I'm sure I would have been transfixed. I am therefore very excited for the arrival of my special edition of American Gods in the mail, which should arrive any day now. This late Christmas present from my father and mother in law is designed and illustrated by Dave McKean. His collaboration with Gaiman raises the work of them both. So, I close the book on The Sandman. I am not sorry to do so. As much as I did enjoy this final volume, I know the effort it took to get here. These impact of these stories rests heavily on all that came before it. I did not enjoy much that came before it. Therefore, I do not recommend this series to any casual reader. There is so much more in comics now that does what The Sandman tried to do in its day, but so much better. Neil Gaiman has grown and improved as a writer since these books were finished. I would point anyone to any of what came from this work before I would ever point them to this work. However, for anyone who has read and loved Neil Gaiman's more recent work, I might cautiously suggest checking out this series. To those readers, I would insist that they find the highest quality version of the books that they can, to read the books in print, not digitally, and to make sure they read the remastered/recoloured version. Similarly, to avid readers of creator-owned comics of the 21st Century, I might carefully suggest that they might enjoy exploring some of the first of what gave us the room for the vast array of choices in the world of comics today. To any reader of The Sandman, I would warn that if the art is a hindrance to your enjoyment at the beginning, it will be a long, long time before it ceases to be so. I am thankful for this book, and this series. But I won't read it again.\u2620The Sandman.

I have never actually admitted that before because I always feel guilty when I do it. With good books, it turns out that it doesn't matter much if a book is read forward or backward. I mean, of course if alters the flow of the story, but there are still plot development, character development, and suspense. Sometimes books are less predictable when read backwards because instead of things leading up to an outcome, one wonders what would cause a character to do something. I read this book backwards and it is my favorite Sandman by far. It would have been if I had read it forwards and I did try to read it forwards, but I just couldn't. I had been dropped off by a guy after a fairly boring and uncomfortable date. He invited himself into my house and then wouldn't leave. He was clearly getting more upset while he was in my house and conversation kept getting worse and worse and he kept finding more excuses to stay. I told him that I had other things to be doing and requested that he leave, but he refused saying that he would only stay a few minutes more. At one point, he got up to look at my books and as he did he glanced at the windows in my living room. With a little jolt of adrenaline, I thought \"The next thing he is going to do is ask for a tour of the house so he can get me away from those windows.\" And that was actually the next thing he did. Not a chance, I hadn't finished unpacking yet. I finally got him to leave by 1. pretending that I was interested in seeing him again, and 2. getting interrupted by a call from my mom (Hallelujah) which broke him out of his contemplative mood as I explained to her exactly where I was and who I was with. As soon as I hung up the phone, he left. Super creepy though.I was also worrying about my vision exam today. I made the mistake of going online and looking up possible reasons for it sometimes seeming like the lights flicker off when they don't. I figured I'd be getting a spinal tap and an MRI. I don't want either. (I laid out the whole year of improving brain function to the doctor and cried a bit. The opthamologist handed me tissues, did extensive visual field testing, discussed the possibility of seizures, ruled those out, found no evidence supporting the theory of a tumor, and then found optic nerve head drusen and said that those could explain everything with my vision. As long as nothing gets worse, he says I am fine and I have get an MRI if the dim bit start lasting more than an instant. He also mentioned that most people are happy when they are getting better. I told him I was happy, but that having stuff changing in your brain is scary even when it is good.)So, I was on edge over the weekend, feeling creeped out and overly worried about my health (which is sort of normal for me when something is a little wrong). I did the only thing that made sense which was to start reading Sandman, albeit, backwards. It made me feel better and relax a bit.My favorite parts were whenever Delirium showed up, especially the parts with the fish. I also liked Lyta and Rose. The female characters really stood out as excellent."}, {"userName": "Maggie Gordon", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20768655-maggie-gordon", "userReview": "And so it comes to the end...The first half of this final volume of the Absolute editions is the story of The Kindly Ones. Remember poor Hippolyta? She finally leaves Daniel with a sitter one night, but of course this means he is kidnapped. The police tells her that they found a body and Hippolyta undergoes a bit of a mental break. She goes on a quest to the Kindly Ones, wanting revenge against Dream as she is sure that he is responsible for her son's death. As Dream killed his son in the previous volume, the Furies are allowed by the rules of the universe to hunt him down. Dream tries to outwit them, but all his plans fail. Or do they? On one hand, much of what happens this issue was orchestrated by Desire, but a lot of Dream's actions seem to be self sabotage as well. This is a weary entity that is pushed to his limits. And in the end, he dies. Yep. This entire series has been leading up to the death of Dream. Of course Dream can't really die, but an aspect of him can. And Daniel? Well, he's not dead, but now he's the new Dream. He looks like the old Dream except he's alabaster white instead of night sky black. If you were reading this series when it originally came out, I can't imagine what the shock would have been like to have the main character actually die. It's an emotional set of issues with strange, stark art that hasn't been used in the series yet. The pacing is excellent (Gaiman benefited from being able to change the length of his trades a bit so stories were never shoved into 4-6 issue formats unless they fit), and the story just so satisfying, albeit also heart wrenching. But Dream's death is not the end. There must be a wake and this is one of my favourite parts of the series. The art work is stunning. The pages are incredibly detailed and all done in pencils, not ink. The whole purpose of these final issues is to allow people to say goodbye to Dream. It's beautiful, solemn, and a perfect way to reflect on Dream's life. Well, maybe not perfect as Gaiman had a couple more issues to go. My favourite of the three is one dealing with Hob at a Ren Faire. He considers death, given his fatigue with life and history, but decides to go on. It's a powerful juxtaposition to Dream's story. There's another short about an exiled Chinese man who accepts his punishment even when offered a way out by Daniel, and finally, the final Shakespeare story. If Midsummer Night's Dream was written for the fae, The Tempest was written for Dream. Gaiman suggests many connections between the famous play and his character's innermost thoughts, and it provides a thoughtful end to a 75 issue series. And there you go... the end of one of the most influential graphic novels out there. Should you read it? Yes! There are thousands of allusions to classic literature and myth, a truly creative and interesting world, and Gaiman tells some really good stories. Don't let the mostly lackluster art turn you off. Sandman is an excellent series that any comic lover, and really anyone who loves SFF, should read."}, {"userName": "Alazzar", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3531937-alazzar", "userReview": "I gave all previous volumes of The Absolute Sandman four stars, because that\u2019s what I felt they deserved. Volume Four is a little different, in that it deserves somewhere between 65 and 80 stars, not to mention three medals, two trophies and a monument.Holy crap, this book was amazing.We start off with \u201cThe Castle,\u201d which is a shorter story from Vertigo Jam #1 that basically takes the reader on a tour of the dreaming. It\u2019s not really necessary to anyone who\u2019s been keeping up with the series, but it\u2019s still bloody fantastic and is more than worth reading.Then we get to \u201cThe Kindly Ones,\u201d which is the greatest story arc ever to appear in The Sandman, or possibly any comic EVER. (Not that I\u2019ve read a whole lot of comics, but still\u2014there\u2019s something to be said about a storyline that can give \nWatchmen\n a run for its money.)I\u2019d always complained about how so many Sandman stories revolved around characters that really had nothing to do with Morpheus or the Endless, but \u201cThe Kindly Ones\u201d erases all that. EVERYONE is brought back at one point or another\u2014every character that you thought would mean nothing after their particular storyline was over, every character you\u2019ve forgotten about because it\u2019s been so long since you read about them in issue #7, shows up in \u201cThe Kindly Ones.\u201d It was amazing to see it all come together. Neil Gaiman is a freakin\u2019 master.Then we get to \u201cThe Wake,\u201d which is brilliant and beautiful and sad and lovely, and whose third chapter displays the greatest use of second-person perspective since Ken Liu\u2019s \u201cThe Tome of Tourmaline.\u201d (Though I guess \u201cThe Wake\u201d came first by 17 years, so maybe it\u2019s the other way around. But whatever.)Then, sadly, the series goes on for two issues too long. It\u2019s not that the last two issues are bad, it\u2019s just that they seemed like filler that someone decided to add because ending on issue #75 sounded much better than issue #73. There was just so much finality at the end of \u201cThe Wake\u201d that it seemed weird to do a pair of standalone stories after that. (Though I guess one could argue that \u201cThe Tempest\u201d wasn\u2019t really standalone, but still, I feel it could have just as easily been placed earlier in the series so we could end on \u201cThe Wake.\u201d)In the end, after seeing how \u201cThe Kindly Ones\u201d brought all the characters of the series together so seamlessly, I feel like a huge asshole for giving the previous volumes of The Absolute Sandman anything less than five stars. I bet if I read \u2018em again, now that I know how things end, my opinion would probably change.

Like the grand, enduring sagas it has joined, Sandman's ending is tragic, painful, and heroic. It's devastating, and also uplifting, with change and renewal threaded through the final arc.

This is the fourth and final volume of a series that spanned millennia and dimensions, through the course we have met William Shakespeare, G. K. Chesterton, Batman, the Emperor of America, Cain and Able, Odin, Lucifer, Puck, many more, not I mention the Dreamlord's own family: Destiny, Death Destruction, Desire, Despair, Delusion (or Delight). The stories took place all throughout history, inside various fairy tales or other well known stories, in the realm of Dream (as well as the realms of his family members), and in Hell. At different times Gaimain plays with different story telling styles and utilizes a wide range of artists' styles.There were times, through this series, that seemed to meander aimlessly (if delightfully), but in this final volume, so many of the meanderings were wrapped up and brought to a conclusion of thought. There were characters from previous volumes that seemed in the periphery, but here they have shown to have primary roles; it is mind boggling.So how do you end a series that is about a timeless being, the Lord of Dreams? The answer is: exactly like this! I love how he wraps things up, comes to a solid conclusion and yet still leaves the imagination to go wild with what could happen next? As much as I loved the wrap up, I thought it was the epilogue that made it perfect, and again, it wraps back around and revisits an early episode where Dream made a deal with William Shakespeare.This series is strange, imaginative, disturbing, thought provoking, beautiful, horrifying, and though it takes some getting into, most enjoyable.

His distinctive stylings are further reproduced on each cover, with attractive stamped detail and silver lettering. Whether you are an old fan or a newcomer, I can't recommend this set of books highly enough.

I'll forever be appreciative of Neil Gaiman's other work but for me The Sandman is a true legacy.Volume Four begins with a foreword by Karen Berger, creator of the Vertigo imprint for DC Comics. It was her belief in an untried comic book writer named Neil Gaiman who made all of this possible. Following the events of Brief Lives, this book pulls us straight into the Kindly Ones story arc, where Morpheus must confront the Furies for his crimes. The threads that the reader has patiently followed through all preceding issues come to a stunning conclusion, a real testament to the superb storytelling that Gaiman is capable of. Besides the arresting nature of the Kindly Ones, there is also The Wake, which introduces us to some new players while also getting a final look at the multitude of characters that we have come to know and love.

It's in this one that we can actually notice quite explicitely all the changes faced by Morpheus when it comes to his behavior, mindset and feelings; not only Endless anymore, closer than ever to human, but actually confused inbetween. By dealing with a wider range of feelings, playing with expectations, taking bold narrative choices and reflecting himself as an author and a man in the story, Gaiman finishes the story in a high and emotional note, turning the Sandman series into something unforgettable and a piece of art that should always be revisited, because new and hidden meanings meanings can always be found."}, {"userName": "Beatriz Mangualde", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27682327-beatriz-mangualde", "userReview": "Penso em ficar lendo e relendo e relendo e relendo do Volume 1 ao 4.

This is the \"best\" if one can really qualify it as such of the series. Why? Everything comes together, and it's never inorganic. Even the strand that feels like it has least to do with the main thread - where the baby, Daniel, is taken away and his mother swears vengeance on the \"one\" who took him, Morpheus - with Rose Walker is still terribly engrossing, especially the seemingly not-much-ado-about-anything except crumpety English women telling fairy tales about a widow's children flying away from a cruel house. Everything here comes to a head, but not with a gigantic battle, but rather existential quandaries, for... whatever Morpheus/dream really is, among his family (including poor Delirium looking for her little doggie). The one downside is that if you haven't been reading the series like super continuously, a couple of the characters who come back from some of the way-back volumes may be a little obscurer. But some of them, like Lucifer playing Cole Porter songs in a piano lounge, are of course indelible, and even throughout the darkest contours there's some wicked humor to be had, or just at the expense of some sexual suggestions and true gallows humor among a wise-ass Pumpkin-man and a raven named Matthew who is my favorite character I think of the whole series: a critical character, but full of conscience, heart and dependability and loyalty till whenever. Whenever Matthew was talking, I was rapt. It's a very BIG story, but among the lot of them it's also just due to the struggle of Lytta, a page turner as well which was a pleasant surprise.The WAKE was a bit of a comedown from the high of the penultimate volume, but still very good, especially for the final-final issue that is meant, I think, for Gaiman to say 'thanks for sticking through so many of these issues where we've had to say goodbye to the hero - who is, sorta, kinda, really, reincarnated as the Dream of the Endless (nay Daniel grown up via orb) - there's one last time via the Bard. Maybe it's because it's just so much a downer, but the art is unique enough to get me through and a reminder of why this character was so fascinating, and awfully flawed (as a person, not in his creation). Overall, this is surely, after work by Alan Moore, THE example to show to people who think of the comics medium as just one simplistic thing as being art. Hell, Gaiman even has Shakesepare show up in two very major moments in the run of the series, and it doesn't feel cheap in the slightest. The artwork, of course, is revolutionary, evolving, as if Gaiman was pushing everyone just by the high quality of his dialog, world-building and destroying, and likely encyclopedic knowledge of mythology and pretty good knowledge of history and cultures and just names for weird shit. There's countless pages one could just take, enlarge, and hang up on a wall. And at the center is a character that, like King Mob in The Invisibles, one wonders if just by the look was patterned after its creator (though I'd hope Gaiman isn't as gloomy). After Dr. Manhattan, speaking of Moore, Dream is the most satisfying and enigmatic of Other-Worldly cold-clinical-thinking beings. Though of course over 75 issues one does get to know this guy and, most satisfying of all, see change occur. That counts.Though this volume isn't entirely perfect, I can even nitpick the Kindly Ones, I give it five stars and hold it up as something extraordinary, as what happens when you can take the basic level of storytelling as, say, talking around a campfire or telling a tale to a child in bed at night and amplifying it to a most epic level."}, {"userName": "Ryan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/204691-ryan", "userReview": "What? A comic book? Does that even count as a \"real book?\" I would submit, based upon reviews and awards given through two decades, that it does. Could be even more than a real book. Many superlatives are thrown the The Sandman's way, and I see why. I was very, very impressed with the story, the writing, the art, the complexity of the plot - but at its core, it's about stories. This is Gaiman's wheelhouse - he likes a good yarn. The Sandman is one of the Endless - seven eternal anthropomorphized aspects of human consciousness: destiny, death, dream, destruction, desire, despair, delight/delirium. Dream is the Sandman, and he oversees what we, and all things, dream and hope and fear. He's close to omnipotent, yet manages to not make things boring. He's complex, and grows, and bad things happen to him that he tries to fix, and often can't. He's got a crazy family, some offspring that cause trouble, and is always dealing with other supernatural entities to preserve the dreamland - wondrous and terrifying - from unspooling. He manages to walk out of Hell because he reminds Lucifer's host of demons that Hell would be nothing were it not for the dream of Heaven. He inspires Shakespeare, he helps lost children. He exacts revenge on lovers that he thinks had spurned him. And he manages to do this all with the utmost serenity. The scope of these ten huge collections are enormous. I read the first three in an enormous anthology, and then the rest in smaller paperbacks. The art is rather good, and the writing is always fun and interesting. Very few full spots. And though lots happens in America and the UK, a lot else happens in the rest of the world - not a pantheon of gods are neglected, and very few nationalities are ignored. But the story soars through our highest hopes to our deepest fears, our funniest jokes to our most disgusting gore, our boring day-to-day to the heights of fantasy. Sometimes the day-to-day is what Dream wants most - the scene I'll remember most is him and his sister Death (who looks like what all the Goth chicks want to look like) feeding the pigeons in New York. Two supernatural uberdeities, and all they want to do is nourish the birds. Clive Barker does this better justice: \"There is a wonderful, willful quality to this mix: Mr. Gaiman is one of those adventurous creators who sees no reason why his tales shouldn't embrace slapstick comedy, mystical musings, and the grimmest collection of serial killers this side of Death Row. He makes this combination work because he has a comprehensive knowledge of the medium and knows where his strengths lie. He has also - and this is infinitely more important than being a Comic Brat - a point of view about the world which he uses the anarchic possibilities of the medium to express. After all, where can the glorious, the goofy, and the godlike stand shoulder to shoulder? Where else can the bubble-gum hearts, the dream travelers, the serial killers, and the occasional guest-star from beyond the grave all occupy the same space? If the sheer profusion of these inventions and the apt absurdity of some of the juxtapositions puts you in mind of on of your more heated dreams, then surely that's what Mr. Gaiman intends. Forget what he's written on the title page. Hero and author are here synonymous. For the time you spend in these pages, Mr. Gaiman is the Sandman. And look! He just brought you a dream.\""}, {"userName": "Leif ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43859211-leif", "userReview": "Still good.

It was a year and a half ago that I realised what a beautiful and creative source of wisdom and inspiration a comic book could be. Wisdom that surpassed the majority of the texts and dialogues I witnessed in every ethics class of my philosophy curriculum. Stories and characters that inspire much more potential Halloween costumes or, gods forbid, a line of McFarlane action figures. That period of revelation came through reading  Absolute Sandman Vol. 1.All that praise for Gaiman's writing to say this: One fifth of the way through this book and I am reminded by Glee and Insight on every page why I now devote so much time reading the great comic books.When I turned to the table of contents I found that the majority of the 473 pages of stories was to be taken up by one enormous 13 part arc. That tip-off has helped me note a few delightful self-referential details:The opening panel of Chapter 2 of the arc titled \"The Kindly Ones\" begins with the words \"Well? How long is it going to take?\" I imagine these words being spoken by Sandman editor Karen Berger.Chapter 3 opens with a brilliantly silver literal and metaphorical yarn being pulled across the first three panels. The opening word bubble, sounding more like Neil Gaiman than the as-yet-unrevealed character speaking from off-page? \"I think it's going to be bigger than I had planned.\" Hi-lar-ious.Skipping a beat and picking the theme right back up at Chapter 5, we see the silhouettes of two veiled women in long gowns (two of the three Gorgons of Greek mythology). A spider dangles deliberately from its \"web\" across panel 1. Woman on the left says in an eerie monotone (as I imagine it), \"It's happening. Very slowly. But it's happening.\" Woman on the right adds, \"It always takes longer than you think, doesn't it?\"Obviously Gaiman has fun poking at the many-layered knot he has tied, daring us to foresee any possible way to untangle it all, this stack of sticky subplot on top of subplot, each doing a fantastic job of maintaining interest and advancing the overall story. Oh, how I've mixed my metaphors. Neil have mercy!"}], "description": "A saga de Morfeus, o Mestre do Sonhar, chega ao seu final!
