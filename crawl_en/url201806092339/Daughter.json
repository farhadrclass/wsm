That hasn\u2019t happened to me in ages. Daughter begins with the story of Miriam and her daughter Aya. They are keeping things together and getting on the best they can with no other family links. One night Aya goes out for her usual run and doesn\u2019t come back. She is shot down by a police officer who mistakes her for a young black male suspect in a recent robbery in the area.

As a mother, a daughter, a Black woman in America, a survivor, a human being sometimes unsure which way is up. Miriam represents generations of women like me- so often raised to hide our emotions, ignore our wounds, forget our past. No time for whining, dwelling, talking about what's wrong, or trying to fix the brokenness inside. For the sake of our children, and the tomorrow we hope awaits them, we skip our healing and focus every ounce of energy on survival. Miriam's childhood, young adult years, and her journey as a mother reflect the decisions we make in order to hold it all together; and how we see those choices differently when things fall apart. In this book, we see Miriam as a daughter, learning the subtle lessons passed down through generations. We see how her upbringing impacts her own decisions as a mother. If we look close enough, we see the connection to our grandmother's mothers, those naturally strong yet unnaturally enslaved mothers whose survival techniques live on in our homes today."}, {"userName": "FreeFormLady ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44597268-freeformlady", "userReview": "This was one of the best books of 2015 for me!

Unfortunately, Bandele decides to give us the watered down version of what this book should have been. The language, the feelings and voices of the characters just fall flat.

We're can I began with this book. I love the story/writing, in fact I find this story to be very strong because it relates to what is really happening in today's world. No parent should bury their child, police brutality have become a very strong point in this story, it shows what a parent go through when they lost there child. This book also shows how communication is broken within the family and that is what I love about the author, she knows how to really touch right inside the story."}, {"userName": "Kristi", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31738445-kristi", "userReview": "Beautiful, brutal, and emotional.

Without a doubt it will touch you profoundly one way or another.Asha Bandele's style of writing I found challenging at first but it didn't take me long to appreciate and enjoy it. With this book she writes from the perspective of the characters featured within however big or small their part is giving you a sense of insight of their feelings beyond their apparent presence.

Without giving too much away, no one should lose every person they\u2019ve loved. Daughter is Miriam\u2019s story, one that contains love, heartache, and bitterness. Aya, Miriam\u2019s daughter, is a teenager who gets in trouble by defending herself against a would be rapist. That act of rebellion is another spin of the same rebellion Miriam put her parents through and to a lesser extent her own parents. The resulting question is always \u201cwas it worth losing \u201c? There are many issues the author touches on that are relevant today. The most obvious, police brutality, highlights why BLM exists. A second lesser topic is classism in the Black community. On the surface, Miriam appears to have it all growing up-2 parents in the home fulfilling traditional roles, not lacking any material need, an exceptional student with a bright future. So what attracts her to Bird, a young Army veteran working as a janitor at her high school? The one missing thing was something that can be freely given, a simple relationship. To be treated as a person capable of thought and emotions, not as an object unable to think logically. Bird offers Miriam love, which doesn\u2019t end in happily ever after. Bird did not grow up with his parents, was raised by his grandmother, enlisted in the Army to escape poverty which brought another set of problems (treatment of African American soldiers). A third issue is the mother-daughter dynamic. Aya and Miriam spend their year together at odds because of perceived failure. Because there\u2019s no real communication, a chance to stop the cycle never happens, leading to the greatest heartache. This novel is one that I hope other people find by chance as I did. I was not expecting Daughter to read as part suspense, part romance, mostly drama. It\u2019s definitely got the makings of a great movie."}, {"userName": "Dee Cherry", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32079652-dee-cherry", "userReview": "This was a nicely written book on reflection & how history repeats itself.

A woman trying to find her place in the world leaves home to be with a man and start a family with him only to have him taken from her too soon and she's forced to raise their daughter alone. But instead of dealing with what's happened, living through the pain and finding joy in life, she closes herself off emotionally, especially to the one person she loves most, her daughter. And when she also is taken from her too soon, gunned down for being in the wrong place and because she happens to look like someone who committed a crime, she's forced to open herself back up to feelings and has to learn to live life again.Situations like the one in this book shouldn't still be happening more than 20 years later; it shouldn't have happened then and it shouldn't be happening now. And even though the story is fictional, the theme behind it is not."}, {"userName": "Michele", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7803695-michele", "userReview": "Very well written, the author's heroine tackles a rough, heart wrenching experience, not once but twice. Losing your most important loved one to senseless violence in the turbulent 60s/ 70s and then again two decades later, it is more heartbreak than anyone should ever have to bear. I was expecting a different ending to this book, but the author chose a different path. Depressing yet uplifting, this is every mother's nightmare. You try to protect your kids from the underbelly but sometimes they get caught in the crossfire. I was expecting Miriam to fight the system, organize and demand justice, but her chosen path was effective on a smaller, nonviolent scale that helped people heal. Glad I grabbed this title.
