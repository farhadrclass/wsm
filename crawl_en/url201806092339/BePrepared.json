Why would you even write a memoir if you\u2019re not going to be completely honest or fully aware of the memories you\u2019re featuring? The author says she simply couldn\u2019t remember all that well her experience at camp when she was young. In that case, write about something that you DO know. Don\u2019t exaggerate.My heart and I couldn\u2019t connect and couldn\u2019t sympathize. Vera is begging her mom to send her to a Russian camp, since she feels it\u2019s the only place where she\u2019s going to feel comfortable, seeing that she doesn\u2019t fit in with the American girls. This \u2018\u2018lack of connection\u2019\u2019 to American culture and inability to \u2018\u2018fit in\u2019\u2019 is only addressed at the beginning of the tale and\u2026 never again. So anyway, Vera and her brother go to camp. For Vera, it\u2019s an awful experience from the start: there are mean girls, disgusting toilets, mean boys, depressing activities (or that\u2019s how Vera makes them look) and religious and patriotic stuff as well that underwhelm her. This is supposedly a \u2018\u2018hilarious\u2019\u2019 story. Yeah, right. I certainly expected it to contain humour and entertain me but, instead, it made me feel\u2026 bad. Not bad for Vera, but bad inside at all the cruelty and jealousy and lying in the book. I don\u2019t even want to send my fictional or future children to camp based on what I just read. Also, I went to day camp ten years ago, and while I understand that it\u2019s not the same, so much of the content here seems out of proportion. Vera is a girl who is easily influenced by her peers, so when the \u2018\u2018cool girls\u2019\u2019 make fun of people\u2026 so does she. And when the cool girls try to take advantage of her\u2026 she lets them. I mean, these things happen in real life, too, but if they\u2019re not explored, in the sense that if the author doesn\u2019t make it clear that this is the wrong situation to be in and the wrong reaction to it, there isn\u2019t much to learn from it. Vera\u2019s camp counsellor helps her figure one or two things out, but it\u2019s as though the author is expecting the reader to realize on their own what is accepted between \u2018\u2018friends,\u2019\u2019 and what isn\u2019t. And once again, nothing, NOTHING, about this book is hilarious. Vera\u2019s art is cute, of course, no surprise there. But boy oh boy do I not agree with the way the author developed this story, especially since it ends on a cliffhanger. I need to say this, so perhaps cover your eyes: That was a stupid decision on the author's part. Who ends a graphic \u2018\u2018memoir\u2019\u2019 on a cliffhanger? I\u2019m assuming there will be a \u2018\u2018sequel\u2019\u2019 to this partly made up memoir? That I will not read?To go back to how judgemental Vera is, she says things like, \u2018\u2018It felt strangely good to see someone else suffer a little,\u2019\u2019 and, \u2018\u2018Geez. He was embarrassing to watch. Crying in front of everyone,\u2019\u2019 and it\u2019s not like she feels bad about saying those things. Can\u2019t you have a little more compassion, especially since you know what it\u2019s like for people to judge you relentlessly?I don\u2019t recommend this book, and I certainly don\u2019t recommend it to kids. They need to be aware that there is ugliness in the world, but they must also learn how to deal with it, and this book is no teaching tool.

Her friends live in fancy houses and their parents can afford to send them to the best summer camps. Vera\u2019s single mother can\u2019t afford that sort of luxury, but there's one summer camp in her price range\u2014Russian summer camp.I'm gonna jump right into discussing the book by highlighting the dreaded sleepover scene that still gives me chills... and it's been over a decade for me. All the more\u00a0painful to relive it through Vera's young eyes. She's trying her hardest to assimilate as smoothly as possible by pulling together a sleepover (by replicating her friend's version), but then her mother gives her Russian twist on it.As a child of Russian Jews (like I mention in my review for\u00a0Natasha and Other Stories), I know all too well that you're\u00a0donzo if your third-grade classmates see those\u00a0Russian letters on the cake...It's these intimate moments of struggling to belong and navigating your own culture that stood out to most when I read\u00a0Anya\u2019s Ghost\u00a0back in 2016. So I was glad to see it delve deeper with\u00a0\n  Be Prepared\n. I mean, the painful courage it took to include the sleepover must've been tremendous.Moving along to Vera finding out about a Russian summer camp \"build around fostering Russian community\" and deciding to join in the hopes of finding people that'll get her. But she's not quite prepared for the conditions set in the middle of nowhere.You pretty much knew what to expect with this introducing letter:\"Dear mom, could you pick me up as soon as you get this? PLEASE! I'm desperate\"What follows is a journey of self-acceptance\u00a0and resilience, finding friendship within the right people, and more and more summer hardships to overcome. I read it in a heartbeat.All in all, I more than keen on reading more of\u00a0Vera Brosgol's graphic memoirs, especially with that ending we got from \n  Be Prepared\n!ARC kindly provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.Expected publication: April 24th, 2018\nNote: I\u2019m an Amazon Affiliate.

Vera Brosgol\u2019s latest book is about her going to a Russian summer camp as a kid and having a bit of a tough time of it. But it\u2019s not all bad and yadda yadda yadda, learning important lessons, etc. In her afterword she talks about condensing two summers of camp into one to make the narrative more exciting, which is fine, but she also makes some stuff up, which was a bit iffy. The bullied nerd gets to win a bit at the end, Vera stumbles across a moose and has a spiritual moment, she happens to find the missing guinea pig and becomes besties with its owner, she captures the flag at the end; these story beats are too pat and smack of contrivance, watering down the memoir aspect of the book. Vera Brosgol knows how to cartoon like the devil though and the book is wonderfully drawn. Ultimately Be Prepared just wasn\u2019t that memorable or interesting a story though I expect it\u2019d probably be more meaningful for teen girls going through similar growing pains. If you\u2019ve not read it, I\u2019d highly recommend Brosgol\u2019s previous book, Anya\u2019s Ghost, instead."}, {"userName": "David Schaafsma", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/269235-david-schaafsma", "userReview": "Vera Brosgol created Anya's Ghost, which I liked very much, so I looked forward to this tale, since summer camp was important to my early life, and is important to some present members of this house now, including one girl. I expect they may really like this story, which is very much based on Brosgol's largely miserable experiences at camp while growing up. She also explains in an afterword that in the process of creating this graphic novel that she consulted her sisters about what camp had been like for them and folded some of their stories into this, making it more fictional.Vera and her brother go to Russian camp, where they do things that kids do at camp, but in the context of a cultural heritage experience, speaking the language and so on. She's young for her group, she has tent-mates that isolate her, she has no friends. But she draws and for a time she is allowed to hang with the older, cool girls. . . until she makes some mistakes that get her isolated again. But here's hope! She eventually makes one friend that makes it all (kinda) worthwhile.I liked it just fine. The cartooning is great. The expected level for readers might be from 3rd to 7th grade. The afterword includes an actual humorously miserable letter Brosgol wrote to her mother from camp. She says he likes camping now. I guess if you hated camp you could commiserate with Brosgol here. Some of it is funny, but most of it is a little sad, I thought. A story for loners who might not always be loners, hopefully."}, {"userName": "Julie Ehlers", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2120450-julie-ehlers", "userReview": "[(Don't worry, though\u2014it all turns out OK in the end.)

Check out my Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfer...Thank you to the publisher for sending me a copy of this in exchange for my honest review! Everyone Vera knows gets to go away to summer camp every year. All Vera wants is to be like the other kids in her neighbourhood. Then, one summer, her mother agrees to send her to ORRA, a Russian summer camp for children just like her! Upon arriving, Vera quickly realizes that she is not going to enjoy her time at camp, the older girls are mean to her and she is extremely homesick. This was super cute! It was nice to see Vera's character development as the story went on. It was fun to see her trying to make friends and learning more about herself as the story progressed. I think this will be great for young readers who are also trying to fit into their own friend groups!

It was chaotic, distractingly episodic, worrisome, strange. Vera goes through all this horrible stuff, and it's painful to witness, but I don't really feel like there's a reason I am going through it with her. Because of the expressive art, I feel happy when she's happy, and worried when she's hurting. But the narrative movement seems to be in no particular direction and there's not enough reflection on her experience or shaping of it. A lot of people are frustrated by because the memoir is pretty fictionalized. That doesn't bother me. Maybe she could have been more clear about it at the beginning of the book. \"Be Prepared: A Memoir That Has Some Fiction In It\"? But she does talk about it at the end of the book, which is more than a lot of other memoirists have done. And yeah, the cliffhanger at the end. Not sure what to make of that. It was frustrating because finally it felt that the book was falling into a kind of shape, offering some closure, and then blam! Random cliffhanger. But I guess it's because there's another memoir coming. All in all, this is more of a two star book for me. It just lacks coherence and I couldn't really connect to much of it. But the art is great and there are moments when the art and storytelling come together in delightful and compelling ways."}, {"userName": "Julie Kirchner", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33400318-julie-kirchner", "userReview": "I love graphic novels and how this format appeals to a wide range of students. This book will definitely be popular with students, but I did have some concerns about whether I feel comfortable promoting it with my elementary students. Vera Brosgol wrote this as a semi-autobiographical story about her trips to Russian summer camp. The moments prior to camp at the friend sleepover and hosting her own sleepover birthday party were heart breakingly real. My own heart ached for her as she tried to fit in with the other girls. When she decides Russian Camp will be the answer to fitting in, I assumed it might not be quite that easy. However, I had no idea how bad it might be. When a rookie nine year old is placed in a tent with two experienced fourteen year olds who treat her horribly because she doesn\u2019t wear a bra and isn\u2019t interested in boys, I was appalled that this might be true to life. The stinky outhouse toilets with no doors and boys stealing flags while they are in use...I just can\u2019t even imagine how horrifying this would be. For me, my concerns are with the incident where the boy gets stung, swells up and is called tit head and also where the girls fly the period stained underwear up the flagpole. These two scenes make it so I don\u2019t feel I can put this in my K-5 library because I have many younger students who read our graphic novels. It\u2019s unfortunate because I know my fourth and fifth graders would love it.

This was in the days when rich people still sent their kids to public schools. They were the kids, that in high school had their own cards, and went on ski trips, and to Summer camp every year.While, I, like Vera in this story, had to make to with what we had, and couldn\u2019t afford to do any of the things that my friends were doing. Certainly not Summer camp. And Vera has the added problem of being diaspora Russian, having come over to the States when she was five. And when she invites her friends over, the birthday cake is in Russian, the soda is made from rye bread, and the pizza isn\u2019t stuffed. So, when she finds out that there is a Summer camp for Russian diaspora, and that the church will help pay for it, she jumps at the chance. She is thinking that finally this will be a place that she fits in.And of course, it wouldn\u2019t be a story, if it worked out like that from the start.This is such a great story, both for kids that don\u2019t fit in, and also for kids that have had to learn to live in a new country, and don\u2019t fit in even with their fellow refugees. The kids are very real, and the story feels the way things do go in life. The author, Vera, says that this is semi-autobiographical, a blending of memories, of people, and situations. Of bad guys who she finally gets to be punished, and good people, and the whole experience.Wonderful, quick, deeply heartfelt read. Most enjoyable.

While I don't share the same experiences of being Russian in America, I certainly sympathized with the essence of her childhood--when you're already an outcast, you dream that you can get away from your present problems, but they generally always followed you no matter how far away you put yourself physically. I love that Brosgol doesn't sugarcoat it either--that in the end, while there were a few good moments, she knew enough that she never wanted to return (well, in essence, as she explains at the end how this was an amalgamation of her experiences).

Although she gets invited to slumber parties with the other girls, she's never really part of the in-crowd. And when she tries to throw her own birthday slumber party, things go horribly awry. Vera always feels different than the other kids and part of that is because, as Russian immigrants, her family is different. Which is why, when Vera hears about a Russian culture summer camp sponsored by her church, she is desperate to go. All the kids in her neighborhood disappear to go to various camps in the summer and Vera's sure she's finally found a place where she will really fit in.But camp is not at all what Vera expected. She's put into a tent with two girls who are best friends and who are much older than her. There's no running water, which means using a disgusting outhouse for two weeks, and Vera can't seem to do anything right. Having no friends at camp is even worse than having no friends at home because at home at least a bear's not going to eat you. And you have toilets.This story is based on author Vera Brosgol's actual experiences and she definitely captures that feeling of being on the outside. What strikes me about this book is that it's so raw and real; Vera makes some bad decisions and some cruel decisions sometimes. Even though she knows how it feels to be the odd one out, she still is sometimes mean to some of the other kids. When you're growing up and you're figuring things out, you don't always make the right decisions and Brosgol doesn't shy away from that.Camp is made out to be this idyllic experience that everyone looks back on with nostalgia and longing. And it's not that way for everyone! I was one of those kids who went to camp and did not have an amazing time. I had a fine time, it wasn't torture every minutes, but given the choice I did not elect to go back. So I definitely identified with Vera.So, yes. Go get this book.

She learns a lot about herself by going to a Russian camp. I really enjoyed how Vera incorporated her own camp experience into this novel with her own written letters and adding her experience to the plot while adding some fictional elements.

I was fascinated by the aspects of it being a Russian camp.\u00a0A great book for fans of Real Friends, Smile, Sunny Side Up.(Don't forget to read the author's note at the end!)"}, {"userName": "Edward Sullivan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2574606-edward-sullivan", "userReview": "A sweet, poignant, funny middle-grade summer camp graphic memoir ."}, {"userName": "Sneha", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15575318-sneha", "userReview": "Utterly charming and relatable!"}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/721302-emily", "userReview": "Unfortunately, the part where they chanted \"tit head\" at someone is going to make it far-less marketable in the community where I work."}, {"userName": "Jessica Bader", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58758846-jessica-bader", "userReview": "I love graphic novels; I bought this one for my girls to read, since I am sending to what I hope is a wonderful camp this summer."}, {"userName": "Lily Williams", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41897516-lily-williams", "userReview": "A truly wonderful tale about summer camp and struggling to fit in.
