Seriously. This is a continuation of Carmine Delmonico's crime fighting adventures, or whatever you want to call them. We met Delmonico in On, Off. This one starts with 12 muder/deaths on one day in a relatively small college city. They seem unrelated, but...are they?The plot was vintage McCullough. It started out with a bang, shocking me into realizing this wouldn't be a calm who-dunnit, but the actual turns of phrase fell short of her usual genius. I know she's been very ill, and I want to think that's the problem with this book, at the same time, I didn't feel On, Off really lived up to her name on the front, so maybe it's Delmonico.In a relatively short book she managed to fit in the above mentioned, 12 murders, plus 2 more and a suicide, rape, necrophilia, child neglect, espionage, political intrigue AND glimpses into the private lives of Delmonico and his team. I couldn't help but feel the entire book would have been improved by about 200 pages more. She's not a flowery describer, but she usually eases us into lives. In this one, I felt she tossed a few details around here and there, no build up, no let down, and the end...whimper instead of bang. She did tell us, in Delmonico's voice that's how crime solving generally ends. You investigate, run around, research, stress, find the killer...and then must wait for a trial that's out of your hands. Maybe that's what she was trying to get across, I just wanted more satisfaction.It seems as if she's going to be devoting some time to this series. If so, I am more than willing to wait for the next installment. I'd prefer the wait for a pure McCullough, than another installment with the clumsy feel this one had. All the more disapointing because the plot was first rate. She was capable of the perfect book using the bones of the story we got...alas."}, {"userName": "Ruth", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1832562-ruth", "userReview": "Alternate title could be Too Many Characters \u2026 and I don't really like a one of them thus far.OK.

I have discovered Colleen McCullough.The novel is a thoroughly enjoyable read. I didn't realise Too Many Murders is the second instalment in the Carmine Delmonico series until some point in the book, but it works well as a stand alone novel. The language style is fast-paced, intelligent and frank. It doesn't hinder on the gruesome details of murders, but focuses on finding who's done it - and there are plenty of suspects to go about guessing.I also liked that the novel doesn't overwhelm the reader with too many description of places or clothes, etc. Everything in the novel is to the point and every word/sentence is relevant to the plot - I didn't feel like or wanted to skip any paragraphs to keep me going.Everything from the opening line of the novel to the last sentence had me involved and I am very surprised that it hasn't been snatched for a film/TV adaptation.

If you\u2019re an avid reader, I think you may finish it without any regrets. But if you are one of those people, who could bear to read only the best of the best, I would not recommend this to you. Don\u2019t know if it\u2019s me or the author, but the writing\u2019s a bit dull. I\u2019m not saying that the circumstances were mediocre, which, on the contrary, were quite extraordinary if you ask me, but the descriptions of them, were. How else, would a crime-mystery novel be written, you would ask me. Well, I concede, an appropriate style of writing it was, then. There\u2019s humour too, quite a lot after the first half, by which time, I think everything gets quite interesting. There\u2019s a terribly funny incident in the book involving an \u201cI could kiss you\u201d moment. I just shut the book and laughed my lungs out. But the book is seriously censored in all aspects except the language. It\u2019s conservative to the core, in terms of the description of events (to me of course, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019d think). I wish the writer dared to be more adventurous. This book definitely needs more spicing up, yes, of that, I\u2019m sure. My favourite quote would be, \u201cColloquialisms are wonderful. They prove that English is a living language, always moving on. \u201dAnother possible downfall, I say possible because some of you may see it as a plus point, is that we are not offered much insight into the officer\u2019s thinking process, a consequence of being written in third person, I guess. It does help to build up the mystery, but sometimes, it\u2019s a bit annoying when we\u2019re left thinking \u2018where\u2019s he going with this\u2019 or at other times, \u2018where did that come from?\u2019 But, on the whole, some things are better left unsaid, I guess.What I love about this book is that out of the blue, from a dreary read (debatable), the author just startles us with a play at our emotions, like the beautiful description of a baby on his father\u2019s lap or the sensual feeling of a wife\u2019s head resting on the arm while driving a car. I had never thought about such things and I\u2019m glad that the author could give me such warm, personal experiences amidst such chaotic events.Truth be said, I\u2019m not much impressed by the mystery, because of the sheer fact that most of the details leading to the conclusion were hidden from us (the nosy readers), thereby not allowing us to have a one on one with the protagonist. And the ones that were exposed gave subtle hints, but pointed fingers everywhere. On that I give points to the author for keeping us thoroughly confused, guessing and re-guessing. It\u2019s a good read, not a great one mind you, but enough to give you three days of sleepless \u2018clueing for looks\u2019.

Her name remains in my consciousness when I picked up this crime fiction in 2010. The title Too Many Murders was enticing for a read. I like mysteries and reading for clues in solving crimes.Colleen wasted no time in launching readers with the first murder of a nineteen year old university undergraduate in the first chapter. A vivid description of walking into a trap and the process of death of this student was laid bare for me to feel the chill down my spine.Colleen, a neuro-physiologist, wrote as if readers can take such details of murder. But then wouldn\u2019t people like horror movies even they knew they might have nightmare after watching them? She brought realism to bear by describing the autopsy of the murdered victims.The undergraduate was not the only murder of that day. There were twelve murders on the same day and in the same city. The way each victim died was different and they were so unrelated to one another. Could it be pure coincidence that there were so many murders on the same day? Were these murders related and there was a singular motive behind them?As I read, I moved from one murder to another. I did not know there were so many ways to kill a person, from strychnine-in-the-orange-juice to bear trap and others. It was just too much gory details for one to stomach. Not anyone can take to this fiction and it can affect one with a faint-heart.I could feel the unknowns faced by the chief of detective as he proceeded with investigations. There were so many possible motives for these murders, but which one was closer to the truth? The motive was complex and there could be a link to espionage of leaking military secrets to the Russians. You cannot speed-read this fiction because you may miss the arguments and clues of each murder.All will be revealed only towards the end of the book. It was unexpected and beyond my imagination. However, the book ended with one paragraph that puzzled me. Maybe I should go back and read this book one more time and solve that lingering unknown."}, {"userName": "Sandie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1331967-sandie", "userReview": "One day, one town, twelve murders.

Are these all singular, unrelated incidents or are they each just one piece of a larger more sinister plan hatched by one cunning mind?

Complicating their investigation even further is the appearance of an FBI agent who reveals that one of the twelve victims is the head a company that works on secret government projects involving the development of defensive weapons and has been infiltrated by an agent of the USSR who has managed compromise company security and appropriate valuable information. (Are we all old enough to remember the Cold War??). The investigation proceeds with the plot becoming more and more thought provoking and convoluted. Who is the killer? Is there more than one?

McCullough does it professionally in all her writing. The amount of suspense and surprises is unbelievable! I am always at shock and surprised all through out the book.

CM is an aficionado of the genre, and it shows. Holloman is a pseudonym for New Haven, and Chubbs University is Yale, the school where McCullough taught neurology prior to becoming a best-selling author. As the moniker Chubbs suggests, CM finds her old employer and the politics of exalted academia worthy of good-natured but barbed disdain. As is often the case with me, I read the whole book in a sort of extended sitting over a day or so, and while I couldn't seem to release myself from its grasp, the book's embrace fell well short of seductive. Her love for and broad exposure to the genre and its convoluted plot twists is very apparent.  In fact, it may be what holds the book back. It's almost as though CM pauses as each plot knot unravels in order to give us time to congratulate her cleverness. This phenomena starts in the first chapter where a smarmy Chubb's sophomore is snapped in half by a steel bear trap that he springs in his dorm room closet while grabbing for the satisfying fruits of extortion, $100,000 carefully contained in Saran Wrap. Perhaps her historical fiction set in Ancient Rome is a better read because the author finds the subject more humbling."}, {"userName": "Andre", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10454979-andre", "userReview": "A quest\u00e3o \u00e9 que est\u00e1 cada vez mais dif\u00edcil encontrar livro novo no estilo cl\u00e1ssico.

Una autora famosa por sus libros de \u00e9poca rom\u00e1ntica del estilo Jane Austen, seg\u00fan tengo entendido, que da un giro de 360 con este nuevo detective Delmonico del Depto de Polic\u00eda de Holloman, NY. Un sagaz sabueso en persecuci\u00f3n de mentes turbadas envuelto entre conflictos muy poco usuales en este tipo de novelas. Debo de reconocer que es muy notable la mano de una mujer en las caracter\u00edsticas del personaje principal, y los dramas secundarios que debe de padecer a lo largo de sus historias, punto nada desmeritorio, al contrario, punto a su favor, pues no es el t\u00edpico defensor del bien envuelto en su mundo sombr\u00edo a un pie del suicidio como muchos otros.Muertes Paralelas,marginal t\u00edtulo en espa\u00f1ol, es una telara\u00f1a de muertes y pistas que van por todos lados y aparentemente no va a ning\u00fan lugar, pero que se resuelve sin ser demasiado forzado, incluso demasiado l\u00f3gica la menea de resolverlo.

The cover got my attention immediatly so I gave it a try and I bought it after having read the first five pages.When I arrived home, I left it in my shelve dedicated to books pending to read. As I had to read some books before, I wasn't able to read it until April and I read it again in August.I really liked the book. It was a mix of everything: anger, jealousy, love, action, mistery, forensic science, different perspective and antique police procedure. It all resulted in Too Many Murders, the second case in where Carmine Delmonico is the detective.It wasn't engaging, but it was interesting. I was able to finish it in more or less three weeks, and I really enjoyed the way Colleen McCullough connected the dots across the novel. It had some interesting characters, Erica Davenport mainly, which allowed the writer to create a final and unexpected turn in the story. I'm definitely reading the book in the future, and I strongly recommend it to crime novels fans."}, {"userName": "Nicola", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14939181-nicola", "userReview": "I originally read Collen McCullough in connection with her Masters of Rome series. It was quite a leap in time and genre when she switched to a small university town in the USA during the Cold War / McCarthyism period. I picked this up by chance off the library shelves (intrigued by the idea of 12 murders in one day) and realized as I began reading it that I recognised the author and that I had read the first book in this series. It was interesting to read as the time setting not only allowed for a nostalgic time period of spies / espionage but for a different style of detective work before cellphones or the internet (and when much forensic work was still in its infancy). I was fine with the busy plot; it was some of the gender bias that irked me at times although given the novel is written by a woman and a meticulous researcher, I suppose the intention is to be realistic to the time."}, {"userName": "Tess Mertens-Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2876749-tess-mertens-johnson", "userReview": "This book is set in 1967, during the beginning of the Women's Movement and the Cold War.Captain Carmine Delmonico is the police chief of a small CT town where 12 murders happen in one day. The first murder found is a student and the murder is especially gruesome, as the victim is not only tortured, but tortured in a way that death happened much later and they lived through most of the pain.As more and more murders are found, more characters and subplots emerge. There is adultery, sexual persuasion issues and too many suspects. Carmine tries to bring it all together, and does in the end, to find the killer.One interesting subplot was Carmine's personal life. He and Desdemona are parents of a five month old child who is yet to be names. For a man in charge of the well being of a city, his inability at home is his Achilles heel that gives his character vulnerability."}], "description": "In her riveting sequel to\u00a0On, Off, Colleen McCullough, the bestselling author of The Thorn Birds, proves once again that\u00a0she is a master of suspense.1967.
