Although set in the 1930s, the comedy is timeless, as the motives and machinations behind these neighborhood brouhahas never really change.Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "M.

In the shop there is a cousin of the proprietor that likes to show off and has a penchant for violence, in evidence later on.He uses a gun he has to scare the customer and even handcuff him, threatening that jail would come next.It turns out that he is no policeman and in fact he no longer holds even his old job as a sort of detective for the railroad.A Series of Unfortunate Events follows, as in that book which bears this title and shops burn down, cars are blown up.I fell that I may give a little bit off here, since I may entice a few lost readers who stumble upon this note.Otherwise, this a forgotten gem of a book I found looking it up that it only has 199 ratings on goodreads.Nevertheless, I am convinced that is an extraordinary work that more than deserves the Pulitzer that was awarded for it.The plot involves a Romeo and Juliet type of love story, whereby the son of the berated client falls for the daughter of the other party.All throughout, the book is also incredibly funny, with various characters competing for the role of the craziest attitude, act or speech.There is a sheriff that competes with characters in some classic comedies- Blazing Saddles or The Life of Brian.A teenager gets hold of a gun and that is serious, but at the same time hilarious in its development and consequences.There are shootings, but even those have a part tragic, part humorous aspect, with pie in the face and fights that create an atmosphere of merry go round at times.Again- I was thrilled by this book."}, {"userName": "Pamela", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4894054-pamela", "userReview": "Mayberry as told by Erskin Caldwell. This book is one of the best I've read in quite a while. The characters are brilliant, the writing is brilliant, the pacing, the plot--it's all brilliant.

To my surprise it was very entertaining, a raucous comedy of errors filled with lust, vengeance, violence, and complete stupidity with everyone involved. Falls a bit short of 5 stars because the feud itself sort of just limps out instead of climaxing, but I suppose such is the way these things often go in real life. Also, some weird racism which is hard to get too offended at as, like I said, every character is a special kind of stupid, but it doesn't have any real point, so it would have been best to cut back on it. Mostly, though, a fun, randy read. Maybe it didn't deserve the Pulitzer, but it doesn't deserve obscurity, either."}, {"userName": "Bill FromPA", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6370216-bill-frompa", "userReview": "Previous: Reinhart's WomenNext: Nowhere"}, {"userName": "Candice", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5452186-candice", "userReview": "Amusing character sketch with an abrupt ending."}, {"userName": "George", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10168276-george", "userReview": "A 3.5 star rating. A funny book about two families in a small American town in the late 1930s. There are a number of odd ball characters. Tony, a 16 year old lad who is just discovering girls, punches a police officer, decides to become a Canadian mountie by running away but then decides to get a job in the town. His sister Bernice comes home from the city to have a week or so at home and loves men. Doesn't help out at home and runs up the family grocery charge account. The hardware store burns down, people are killed, a teenager threatens people with a gun....and that's just a small sample of what happens in this light comic novel of 262 pages."}, {"userName": "Frank", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3465678-frank", "userReview": "In The Guardian this book was recently championed as a forgotten classic. On the strength of this review (and Tom Cox gives a fair assessment of the novel) I hunted out this hard to find book, and was not disappointed.Although initially I was, a little. The prose is a little lacklustre. On the strength of this one book, I wouldn't recommend Berger for his writing style. His narrative, however, especially as you are caught up in its wheels after about a third of the way, is excellent. All the comparisons mentioned by Cox in his Guardian review are on the mark: the Coen Brothers, 30s screwball comedies (but a darker, more lower class version of that). In the end, it also made me think of a less cartoonish version of The Simpsons.I think that with some effort, this migth be turned into a film that's even better than the book. Or a TV-series, which would require less pruning of the narrative lines. Because that's how the book works, it's as though it's imagined as a film script from the start.In the meantime, we have this outrageous little novel, which is sadly out of print."}, {"userName": "Alarie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2587533-alarie", "userReview": "Everyday people acting like total imbeciles have long been a mainstay of comic writing. The ploy fell a bit flat for me in this election year when bad behavior is the norm. Men with guns who abuse power, terrorize people, and assault women were never funny to me, and I don\u2019t want to read about racism unless it\u2019s used purely for historical context. Not funny. That said, this often slapstick novel did make me laugh.Many of the main characters were endearing, so I was pulling for things to work out. Set in the late 1930s, two families in adjoining small towns get caught up in a feud. What starts by each side behaving idiotically is soon fueled by unfortunate (or humorous) coincidence, malice, ignorance, and fear. There\u2019s even a Romeo and Juliet twist \u2013 without any harm to the young lovers."}, {"userName": "Tommy Baker", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38555974-tommy-baker", "userReview": "I was on board with this mildly dark satirical comedy for the first half or so. Then I think Thomas Berger makes a mistake of misjudging the interest the reader might have in such a prick of a character like Reverton Kirby, even if meant in a comically ironic way. It's really unpleasant rattling around in his head for a couple of chapters. When reading this I started to think longingly about the next book to start. A more successful miserable character is his teenage cousin Junior, but even with him, I mean, do I really need to know he likes to piss in the shower?The other family in this \"feud\" is much more readable, especially the brothers Tony and Jack. Their dialogue is great, and much more personally relatable in their human foibles."}, {"userName": "Christopher Sutch", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2475981-christopher-sutch", "userReview": "This 1983 novel won Berger the Pulitzer, though I'm not sure why. It's a fine novel: interesting characters, competently written. But that's also the problem with it: there is nothing very original about it, nothing that gives Berger's best works a special flavor or make them worthy of interest. Partly, for me, this comes from my lack of interest in the setting (1930s Ohio town life, much like his earlier novel _Sneaky People_). Also, though, there is little social satire or commentary in this work (even the topic of race and racism, a staple in Berger's earlier works, is largely by the way here). Rather a disappointing reading experience."}, {"userName": "Dhaval", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1528606-dhaval", "userReview": "*3.5/5 starsThe American classic of the Beelers and Hornbecks in small town America. A feud erupts between the families when Mr. Beeler goes over to Mr. Hornbeck's hardware store for some supplies. A series of comical misplaced blame leads to a slapstick comedy of misunderstandings. Mr. Berger also highlights the hypocrisy of the \"wholesome\" small town, as each character rationalizes their poor decision making. A reminder that vices weren't invented anytime recently."}, {"userName": "Benjamin Kahn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8254203-benjamin-kahn", "userReview": "I enjoyed this book, but it's hard for me to nail down why I liked it so much. It was a simple story, the characters all hovered on the edge of parody but didn't quite go over it. I was intrigued to see each twist and turn with all the characters and how their lives intersected. Just an fun, enjoyable read. You care about the characters and want to see how everything works out for them."}, {"userName": "Thing Two", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3722823-thing-two", "userReview": "LOL funny!
