The politics of the evolving rulers were distinctly different. On June 25, 1950 the North Korean army crossed the 38th parallel invading South Korea. United States President Truman appealed to the United Nations. They first asked for the invasion to cease. On June 27, 1950 they asked for member states to provide military assistance to the South.

Sergeant Reckless: The True Story Of The Little Horse Who Became A Hero (Balzer + Bray, an imprint of HarperCollinsPublishers, September 12, 2017) written by Patricia McCormick with illustrations by Iacopo Bruno chronicles the remarkable service of this animal.

In the Korean War, one group of U.S. Marines were exhausted carrying shells up a hill to a cannon when one of them, Lt. Eric Pedersen, had an idea. Why not use a horse? The problem was that the only one he could find was a small mare with a white blaze, more a racehorse than a mule. He took a chance, and she, who earned the name Reckless, became that horse. Iacopo Bruno creates the pages with war scenes of soldiers working and fighting and resting while all along, Lt. Pedersen trains the mare. Through patience and a lot of treats (he soon learned she loved to eat--everything), they readied her with a big pack, then loaded the shells. She didn't try to throw them off but was calm and seemed ready to do her job. I enjoyed how Iacopo created some illustrations like photographs with scrapbook corners or extra pieces that add to the scene, like playing cards and poker chips when the soldiers were playing poker, with Reckless, too! The illustrations are full of action on every page, beautiful to see! Patricia McCormick writes the story about this amazing relationship from the beginning training to when Reckless helped the soldiers make it through an important battle. Here are those statistics for Reckless during that battle: fifty-one trips, gone a distance of thirty-five miles up and down steep terrain, carried nine thousand pounds of ammunition. Reckless saved many lives through her actions. It's hard to see how she survived! After being promoted to Staff Sergeant at the end of her career, she was allowed to move to the U.S.  The backmatter shares that Reckless had three colts: Fearless, Dauntless and Chesty. There is also a wonderful backstory written by Patricia McCormick about how she discovered this story and about the early life of Reckless and her original owners.The endpapers are collaged with newspapers showing war headlines and then at the back, parts of the medals and acclamations earned by Reckless. It's an inspiring story of a horse who helped soldiers do hard things, even in the terrible noises and dangers of battle, and the soldiers who loved one horse."}, {"userName": "Debra", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5185313-debra", "userReview": "Wonderful illustrations just draw you into a book about an amazing horse who served in the Korean Conflict. To solve the problem of the soldiers wearing themselves out carrying the heavy ammunition uphill to a new cannon, Lt. Pedersen had the idea of finding a mule to do the job. But all he could find has a scrawny mare. It turned out that she had the heart of a warrior and a set of nerves to match. Oh, and an appetite that wouldn't quit - she ate anything. Her morning breakfast had her rousing the chef each morning in his bunk so that she could eat her scrambled eggs and toast and then wash it down with a cup of coffee.  The horse was named Reckless after the name of the cannon she was supplying but also for her actions. Her long day in the Battle of Outpost Vegas ended with her making 51 trips carrying 9000 pounds of heavy ammunition under fire for a distance of 35 miles up and down the steep hill to the cannon and helped change the course of the war. For that devotion to duty, she was promoted to Sergeant. After the war the soldiers started a campaign that brought Reckless to the United States. She lived out her life at Camp Pendleton and mothered 3 foals. Her official retirement care specified that she be given Coca-cola in limited amounts and scrambled eggs lightly salted and without pepper. (These details are found in author's notes at the end of the book). Also, a life-sized statue of her can be found at the National Museum of the Marine Corps in Quantico, VA."}, {"userName": "Bethany", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36594604-bethany", "userReview": "SERGEANT RECKLESS is an inspirational true story about a horse named Reckless who helped turn the tides at the Battle of Outpost Vegas during the Korean War.Reckless was a young, small mare and the men weren't sure whether or not she'd be able to keep up with them, but they trained her nonetheless. Her training consisted of kneeling to avoid bullets, retreating, and carrying ammunition. She picked up on these skills quickly thanks to the various rewards she received, such as chocolate or apples.Reckless had an appetite and as she worked to carry their ammunition, she slowly became part of the group. The cook would even make her breakfast every morning. Then, the battle reached them one morning while they were unprepared. Reckless was fearful, but knew what her job consisted of. She worked so hard that day that it changed everything and helped to save many men.Final Verdict: I loved everything about this book. I love that it was based off of a true story. The layout of the book was beautifully crafted with a military feel throughout the whole thing. It's a story I wish would've been told sooner because it's inspiring to read about a horse that defeated the odds that were stacked against her. I would highly recommend this book to boys and girls ages six and up who want a feel good story or love history. Make sure you read the author's note at the ends too because it gives a little bit more insight to how this story was discovered."}, {"userName": "Arminzerella", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1769011-arminzerella", "userReview": "Sergeant Reckless started off her career in the U.S. Marines in Korea, during the Korean War, when Lieutenant Eric Pedersen had the idea of training a mule to carry ammunition uphill to their cannon. When no mules were available, they recruited Reckless, a \u201cscrawny sorrel mare\u201d with a huge heart and an even bigger appetite. She underwent training to make her bomb-proof and teach her her new job. And Reckless ingratiated herself with the troops by eating everything in sight (rations, chocolate bars, people breakfasts, etc.). Her bravery and determination on the battlefield eventually earned her Sergeant\u2019s rank, and when the war ended, the soldiers who had fought alongside her found a way to bring her to the United States where she was able to retire.
