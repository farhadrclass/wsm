It started promisingly enough, with a young man entering the, so called, model Jewish settlement at Theresienstdadt, Czechoslovakia. World War II was still in flow and he quickly learnt the full horror of what actually went on in the camp to which he had been sent. In reality this camp (it really did exist) was used as a transit stop for Jews on their way to one of the extermination camps. Quite a few never made it beyond this stop and were killed there. It\u2019s harrowing stuff.Having not previously having read the blurb I was then taken aback by the book\u2019s sudden switch to contemporary London. From this point the narrative alternated between the historic back story and the modern action where two journalists, Mark and Danielle, found themselves becoming entangled in the tale of an elderly German looking to tell his story of life in Theriesienstdadt. Up to this point it was ticking along acceptably, but then it fell off the rails. I\u2019d purchased the audiobook version very cheaply (hence I hadn't looked too closely at the plot but had noted that there were some very good ratings provided by a number of very satisfied customers) and I began to get irritated by the reader. His German accent was just about acceptable but his monotone reading of the story was wearing me down. I started to wonder whether the reader was the problem or if it was really the material he was working with. I concluded it was both!The character of Danielle was totally unconvincing. Her relationship with Mark didn\u2019t ring true: one minute they\u2019d just met and seemingly moments later they were professing undying love for each other \u2013 ok, it can happen\u2026 but not as described here. And her religious devotion seemed to rocket from disinterested Jew to full piety in the space of a couple of chapters. The dialogue throughout was clich\u00e9d and dull. All the bad guys (all of whom pretended to be good guys) were as easy to spot as a toupee at a bald man\u2019s party. And the plot was turgid and predictable. There was a twist near the end that I hadn\u2019t seen coming, but it was so absurd it just seemed to underline the banality of the whole thing.I guess I may offend a few of my reader friends who loved this book - and I know that some did - but I can only speak as I find. Not for me, this one. Oh, and why two stars and not one? Well, simply because (for a reason I can\u2019t quite fathom) I did hang on in there to the bitter end."}, {"userName": "Ann", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11727203-ann", "userReview": "SCHREIBER\u2019S SECRET\t\t\t\tBY ROGER RADFORDWhat an absolute treat this book was!

One narrative deals with the crimes committed by the Nazi's in the Czech Republic, particularly the famous Theresienstadt concentration camp not far from Prague. We meet a varied group of Jewish characters as well as their Nazi torturers. Some of the writing here is rather explicit in its violence, I need to warn you (although still little compared to the horrors we know occured in other places). The story is told in snippets, adding suspense and interest as the parallel story unfolds as well.This second narrative deals with two murders in the UK years after the war, which point the finger to Theresienstadt and one of the Nazi officers and a case of mistaken, stolen or assumed identity.The difficulty for the prosecutors is to find out who the killer, Schreiber from the title, is in the present.Based loosely on or inspired by the real case of a convicted Nazi officer 'Ivan' the story offers plenty of food for thought, mystery and turns to make the reading experience on a superficial level only already a breath taking and compulsive one. I hate to resort to over-used phrases but I found it hard to put the book down and was eager to find out what was going to transpire.As the plot thickens and the past comes back into the present however there is much more to this gem of a book than the entertainment and suspense factors. We get to look at some issues deeply, such as guilt and forgiving, identity and conformity. There are great lines in this book to ponder on and some inspiring characters that have interesting thoughts and attitudes. The plot could never unfold in this amazing way of these characters had not been so well set up and put together.As writer of historical fiction in the same period I can vouch that the historical setting is authentic, the facts are accurate and the camp life is competently described.This is a powerful read that I would love to see being made into a movie. 5 stars because I can't give it 6."}, {"userName": "Fran", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1032865-fran", "userReview": "Schreiber\u2019s Secret: Roger RadfordThe atrocities described in this gripping thriller are real, and the Holocaust did indeed happen. As Herschel Soferman and Oskar Springer meet in the Theresienstadt transit camp near Prague, they forge a friendship for survival. The conditions are deplorable, the food inedible and the final outcome brutal. World War II brought us Hitler, whose reign lasted too long and whose brainwashing over the German people caused shock waves throughout the world. Many turned a blind eye to what so many endured. Hans Schreiber was a sadist. SS officers were known to do horrific things to those they held captive within the walls of these unkempt camps. You are about to enter the war along with those that fought for survival and see first-hand what they endured, as author Roger Radford vividly describes and depicts the terrors and horrors the Nazis inflicted on so many. Inhumane treatment and despicable actions cause the reader to want to seek more than just simple revenge on this monster. Defining what happened and vividly explaining what those that survived endured pales in comparison to the actual events. The graphic descriptions brilliantly depicted within the pages of this novel take readers inside the arenas where men were pitted against men and the final outcome was death. Standing aloof and enjoying the spectacle was Hans Schreiber. The word monster seems too tame for the man. The SS men under his direction stand by and watch as this sadist, guided by his sick mind, orchestrates the events.Mark Edwards is a crime reporter for the London Evening Standard and receives an anonymous phone call that rocks his world. One man claims to have information that would set the record straight, but first he has to be sure that Schreiber no longer poses a threat to him or anyone else. Theresienstadt is where it took place, but moving to London in 1995, we learn that hate is still a powerful tool, and the end result is two murders in the eastern suburbs of the capital. A cab driver hopes his final fare will take him in the direction of his home and provide a hefty sum. Thinking that he might have a lucky night, what transpires will have the police searching for answers to the past. Two brutal murders and both bodies mutilated in the same way. The similarities are clear, the evidence is not hidden and the road points to one man. Could this be a serial killer or are we looking at a re-enactment of the means or method of what one man did to dead prisoners during the Holocaust? As Mark Edwards takes on the case, he enlists the help of Danielle Green, a Jewish colleague with whom he has ignited a romantic relationship. The pair soon learn that not everything is what it seems; illusions are often created and the link to it all is someone with the initials HS. But which one of the characters with those initials HS do they stand for? The killer leaves two notes, refers to these initials, and leaves his well known trademark. Henry Sonntag was an inmate of Theresienstadt and has decided that his story needs to be told. Sonntag agrees to be interviewed by Danielle Green. We hear his voice as he allows readers to envision the tortures he endured.  The author flashes back many times, and we learn more about Herschel Soferman when Schreiber uses him as his favorite. In this particular case the definition takes on a whole new meaning. Within this novel, the author reminds readers that not everyone believed that the Holocaust really happened or that there were many war criminals that needed to pay for their crimes. We hear the voice of the Rt. Hon. Douglas Hurd, CBE. MP, Secretary of State for the Home Office in London, as an inquiry into war crimes ensues, and a law that they want passed is in question. In chapter four, we enter the House of Commons, hearing the voices of the Speaker and Hurd as the final decision is brought to light. Arguments are heard, the evidence presented and the decision made. War crimes are defined and voices are raised. The final outcome you will have to read and learn for yourself. A man is arrested for the murders of a cab driver and a wealthy businessman. An anonymous caller and source is revealed, linking both to the Small Fortress at Theresienstadt. Identification is made and the trial will eventually take place. Why does Danielle think this man is innocent? In the course of their investigation, Mark and Danielle learn more about the war. Mark enlists the help of a German professor on sabbatical in London. Danielle questions the professor and the discussion gets heated. The research and the history included in this novel is quite extensive, and the many ways German SS officers made their way to Britain after the war is revealed. When you hear the voice of one survivor tell his story and the graphic depiction of the events he endured in the Small Fortress, you, the reader, must decide for yourself whether the man charged is guilty of Nazi War Crimes, and whether the 1991 law that states War Criminals can be tried in Britain should be employed and upheld. It is an interview so powerful and so graphic that you will read it more than once to make sure you get the full impact of what is being said. Danielle visits the defendant in jail, a harsh reality is revealed, a twist to the plot that will keep readers wondering just who is guilty and who has created their own veil of lies and deceit. A trip to Germany and Israel will hopefully help Mark and Danielle learn the truth about Hans Schreiber. Who is the defendant? Who is the man that claims to be Herschel Soferman? A trial so filled with hate and anger and so powerful that readers will learn just what Hans Schreiber has been hiding all these years. The setting is the Central Criminal Court, the Old Bailey, and the players are in place as reporter Mark Edwards and feature writer Danielle Green take a leap of faith in the hope of discovering the truth. Two men recount their experiences in the Small Fortress, but which one is telling the truth? When Mark hires a private detective to learn more about Sonntag, the end result will bring to light that someone is out there and wants to prevent the truth from coming out. A courtroom scene becomes utterly compelling as two lawyers will stop at nothing to win! Just who is the real Hans Schreiber, and who is the imposter? When the final scene in court is presented, readers will be left with unanswered questions. As Mark and Danielle search for the truth, they question the one man who just might be able to give them the answers? What was Schreiber\u2019s Secret? What happens when you hear the harsh words that one man leaves for everyone to ponder? Author Roger Radford creates an ending that will leave readers wanting more. Powerful, historically correct, creatively written and told in many voices as we hear two men who claimed to have been there. Which one reveled in the pain of others? Which one tortured so many defenseless victims? Whose story is the truth? Will Danielle and Mark find the answers they are looking for? Is there more to tell? A first-rate novel filled with twists, turns and a surprise ending the readers will never expect. Hans Schreiber: A secret so devastating that when revealed many lives will never be the same. An outstanding novel that reminds readers that the Holocaust really happened and we must never forget.

I found the blurb catchy and interesting so I took a chance. For me, it missed the mark. There is a great premise hidden deep in the story and I mean deep. I can understand using lovers to drive the vehicle, but when the story centers more around them then the true path of the work, the result falls a bit flat. Pros\u2019s 1)\tThe book start out with an excellent description of Theresienstadt and the fortress within the way station. It was easy to be swept up with hate and contempt for Herr Schreiber. Sadly, this was the best part of the book.\tCon\u2019s 1)\tThere are a host of formatting and spelling issues which need to be addressed. They did interrupt the flow of the read. The overuse of sudden and suddenly became overbearing.2)\tEmpathy. For such a fascinating story, I found it difficult to feel anything for the victor or the victim.3)\tThe love affair between Danielle and Mark was trite and I didn\u2019t believe it added anything to what should have been a gripping tale. In fact, instead of the story centering around Schreiber\u2019s Secret, it revolved more around these two. 4)\tThe first change from present to past, was very jarring. There was no indication of going back in time. I believe this occurred halfway through the story. If we\u2019re going into the past, it could have been a much smoother transition.5)\tThere were so many missed opportunities for real suspense, I lost count. Instead of resolutions or shocking revelations, the story would just stop. The one that comes to mind happens during the trial. We are given this long drawn out presentation from the prosecution. I wanted to hear the same from the defense and instead was greeted with, wait for it, nothing. Very disappointing. I can see where this book could appeal to survivors or relatives who were all too familiar with the brutality of the Nazis and the camps they forced victims to die in. Overall, I was mildly disappointed with the work. *** Since I published the review, Mr. Radford and I have been in communication. He is addressing the issue of the misspellings and formatting issue with due diligence. He also explained the true premise behind the book. It was fascinating to say the least. Still, I held my ground with the unresolved issues. It was a spirited discussion. I relish the opportunity to chat with other authors and listen to them describe their thought and reasoning process. We must have chatted a good thirty to forty-five minutes talking politics and recounting his days as a war correspondent. When he told me he was at the Golan Heights in 1972, I was hooked. With no bias, I am raising the star rating to a three and-a-half as the first con I pointed out is being resolved. I look forward to continuing discussions with this fascinating author and human."}, {"userName": "Christoph Fischer", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13998364-christoph-fischer", "userReview": "\"Schreiber's Secret\" by Roger Radford is a masterfully written thriller.

I couldn\u2019t get enough of it when I was younger but I soon grew weary of it and (perhaps unfairly) stopped reading it altogether. I am pleased to have been presented with the opportunity when signing up for theindieview.com to be introduced to some modern works by indie published authors and perhaps rekindle the curiosity I once had for fiction set around international politics.The story flits between two time periods \u2013 Nazi era Czechoslovakia and modern day Berlin and London. We are introduced in the earlier period to Hans Shreiber, a horrific and truly sadistic SS Officer; we are given a thorough summary and left in no doubt that this man was an utter psychopath. This narrative is carefully woven along with the modern stories as two reporters investigating the murders of Jewish Londoners (the first a cab driver). In their investigation they learn of Schreiber and come to understand that he is now in modern Britain \u2013 their goal is to discover his modern identity. The job of the authorities after learning this information is to figure out who he is. Though not a page-turner, it is not dull by any stretch of the imagination. The writer bides his time, careful to set the plot out clearly and tell us what we need to know when we need to know it. In this, he keeps our curiosity piqued.This is one of the better edited examples of the indie published work I have read in the last few months. All credit to the writer and his beta readers. The text flows well and has the right feel for the genre; the writer has emulated the expected style very well. This is not the sort of genre that I read very often these days though I used to read a lot of it in my teens and twenties. Though my attention drifted at times, that is far more to do with my lack if interest than any flaw in the writing \u2013 congratulations to the writer for keeping my attention in the long run.Some have commented on the graphic violence, and it certainly is but it doesn\u2019t feel gratuitous, it is as brutal and as shocking as it needs to be. We are talking about a Concentration Camp here after all and the very real issue of Nazi war criminals who escaped punishment and ended up in the countries that were allied against them, some smuggled out by those governments and others smuggled themselves in and forget a new identity.The research is meticulous and feels far closer to a real criminal investigation \u2013 so it fuses crime drama with political thriller rather well too. I believe the author had a background in this. When he emailed me the copy he explained his history but sadly I cannot find the details now. Either way, he has put his background to very good use here.A solid 4/5See more book reviews at my blog"}, {"userName": "Ann", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11727203-ann", "userReview": "What an absolute treat this book was!

After that there were many novels, some autobiographies and movies that were based on Nazi death camps and yet, today, there are certain groups of people who deny the holocaust. The author did exhaustive research before writing this story, as he relates at the end of this novel.The aspect of this story against many others is that it is a mystery. It certainly sets forth the horribleness of these Nazi camps centered around two young Jewish men who suffered at the hands of one Hans Schreiber, the commander of a separate department of Theresienstadt, a death camp near Prague, so notorious because of Schreiber that it was certain that anyone sent there would never leave alive and would be subjected to the most horrendous experiences while there. There is no doubt that Schreiber is a sadist. It is only by a slip of fate that Herschel Soferman escapes and Schreiber believes him dead.The book shows how so many Nazis were able to escape Germany before and after it was conquered in WWII and both Soferman and a man utilizing the name of Henry Sonntag made it to England. Then one week suddenly there were two deaths: a taxi driver had his throat cut and a swastika carved into this skull and an industrialist killed the same way. This is the trademark of Schreiber who usually shot a person in the neck and then carved the swastika on the victim\u2019s forehead. The British police eventually arrest Henry Sonnatag, a rich man doing business with the industrialist and was overheard making a threat against him. Information is given the police to lead them to believe that the killer is actually Schreiber. Later Soferman is dragged into the circle of suspicion. This story is excellently and professionally written with many flashbacks, laying the clues out so that a mystery is building and yet at the same time, is educational and informative for those readers who are unaware of the holocaust and its extensive damage. This story is based on history, but the Nazi tortures, etc. is given to us in bits and pieces around these flashbacks so that it doesn\u2019t become too dark and depressing. It was a page turner for me and I recommend it."}, {"userName": "Harold Kasselman", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16965781-harold-kasselman", "userReview": "This is the second book I have read by Mr. Radford (Winds Of Kadeem)and I enjoyed this even better than the 5 star rating I gave to that book.

Plus, it's not an easy book to review because I don't want to give anything away. I thought I'd have a really hard time with the Holocaust sections, and given I was listening, my absorption of the novel was quite vivid - which can make things harder. But I \"handled\" it just fine. Definitely a page turner that keeps you changing your mind every page, it seemed. Steady pace in that it wasn't rushed, but fast in that I wanted to keep going. The characters, imagery, suspense, and writing style were great. Very smartly written. I'm not a historian, but as I learned by other reviews, it's highly historically correct, which brought more depth to the nuances of the story.

There's a bit of something for all reading types: suspense, historical fiction, perhaps some light romance and a chuckle or two? It's easy reading; although I thought it was a bit \"plodding\" at first...but then again the Holocaust is pretty heavy subject matter. I have always felt invested in WWII Era and Holocaust stories, so I kept reading. About 20 pages in, the scene changes to \"modern era\" and the real story begins. All I can say is WOW...I'm not going to give away \"Schreiber's Secret\" (which was pretty fabulous); but I am going to say that the story also gave rise to a lot of soul searching and new perspectives...Mind Blown!"}, {"userName": "Hans Bronkhorst Bronkhorst", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40720069-hans-bronkhorst-bronkhorst", "userReview": "Schreiber\u00b4s secret is a fantastic read that deserves a five stars rating. The book relates the story of holocaust survivor Herschel Soferman, who suffered tremendous cruelty at the hands of SS Obersturmbannfuhrer Hans Schreiber in Treblinka. Soferman manages to survive the war and emigrates to the UK. The story is told from the viewpoint of English crime reporter Mark Edwards, who becomes involved in the Soferman-Schreiber story when a Jewish cab driver gets murdered in the same way that Schreiber used to kill his Jewish victims and a man who claims to be Herschel Soferman claims that Hans Schreiber is alive and murdering Jews."}, {"userName": "Geoff Woodland", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4350859-geoff-woodland", "userReview": "I spent every spare minute reading this book and thought it had the making of a great film. At the end of the book the author mentions that it has been bought by a film company.The author\u2019s excellent descriptive skill of the horrors of the concentration camp has the reader in the camp with the main character. I could smell the despair of the prisoners, yet the feeling that they had to stay alive. As I read the story it occurred to me that the author must have spent a huge amount of time on his research \u2013 not just for the concentration camp period, but also various other scenes later in the book. The twists and turns of the story requires the reader to be attentive. Highly recommended!"}, {"userName": "Judy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9850325-judy", "userReview": "My Review: I hesitate to say I enjoyed this book since it deals with such a dark moment in history. However I did find it absorbing. It kept me reading long past when I should have put it down. The concept of brothers on different sides in Nazi Germany was unique. I believe I figured out what happened and who the real monster was and which monster was made. However I wish it would have been revealed for sure. The ending really didn\u2019t seem to be an ending at all. The romance between the reporters didn\u2019t seem necessary in this book and it was not well done. Editing could have been a little better. I give this book 4 stars."}, {"userName": "Dottie Resnick", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5391590-dottie-resnick", "userReview": "The suspense and twists and turns made this Holocaust story all the more captivating. It includes some horrendous scenes and details which may be difficult to read however.
