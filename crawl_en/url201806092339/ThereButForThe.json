Siri Hustvedt, for instance, would have made all the disparate perspectives mirror an overarching preoccupation with the self, nearly indistinguishable from each other in terms of their pedantic, self righteous theorizings. She would have hurled fact after fact which lead up to some grandiose declaration, impatient to broadcast the breadth and depth of her scholastic achievements, her research. A character's whiteness, blackness, womanliness or gayness would have subsumed his/her individuality, and counted as a prime factor in determining their position in the narrative's schema. Not exactly a Russo or Bechdel test fail but close. But mercifully Ali Smith is no Hustvedt or any other writer intent on bandying about the Big Themes with no effort at subtlety. She unravels her carefully arranged skein of subject, plot and narrative device in a way as to prod our internalized prejudice into emerging from its comfortable hidey hole in to the clear light of day. Busted aren't we? How many of you visualized Brooke as a white yuppie offspring, golden bangs falling across her forehead, rosy cheeks flushed with delight, till she is revealed as a Brooke Bayoude? Pat yourself on the back if you didn\u2019t. Because it is simple enough to presuppose whiteness whenever a precocious child of sunny disposition is spoken of. The Scout Finches of the world are easily conjured up by memory and awareness. And Smith shines the light on this sad revelation. \nWhat would happen if you did just shut a door and stop speaking? Hour after hour after hour of no words. Would you speak to yourself? Would words just stop being useful? Would you lose language altogether? Or would words mean more, would they start to mean in every direction, all somersault and assault, like a thuggery of fireworks? Would they proliferate, like untended plantlife? Would the inside of your head overgrow with every word that has ever come into it, every word that has ever silently taken seed or fallen dormant?\nWhat else does she manage, you ask? Create small moments of such profound tenderness that they knock the breath out of you without ever being glibly sentimental. Call into question our complicity in the perpetually recurring small injustices normalized by the \u2018system\u2019. Lovingly dissect the fact of language and art and history wound around each other to produce this layered narrative of our reality. Us and them, you and I, spread out across divides of time and place, engaged in our quiet, quotidian struggles to rise above our worst failings, but converging at some point in a then or a now which may mean nothing in the greater scheme of things but does, all the same. Lost time that can never be regained. The wonderful, beautiful, terrible 'then' - of friendship and motherhood and tenuous bonds between new acquaintances, random strangers - which fades in and out of consciousness, edging closer to oblivion with every passing second but somehow surviving in the end. Much like hope, much like love, much like life. What else can a reader want?"}, {"userName": "Fionnuala", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5498525-fionnuala", "userReview": "Reviewed in February 2013There is no doubt in my mind that Ali Smith is a fine writer, a reader\u2019s writer, maybe even a writer\u2019s writer, although I suspect there are writers out there who think she makes it all look as easy as an unmade bed. There you go, people differ hugely in what they rate as interesting or significant, but whatever kind of writer Smith is, she\u2019s definitely my kind, and for the long term. There will be, I hope, many more of her books to enjoy since she is one of the rare woman writers I admire who is younger than I am. There\u2019s a positive thought! There is profit to be found in the oddest places if only we look for it.But what is this book about, you ask, with a title like that? There but for the..what? But for the accidents of birth and death, the accidents of time and place, me here, you there, me now, you then, the inhumanity of man towards his fellow, all of the terrible things which, because they happen to you, can't happen to me. There but for the grace of God go I, as my parents' generation used to remark, in a kind of incantatory and consolatory refrain whenever they were faced with tragedy happening to other people. But the book is also about the fact that none of that matters in the end since in spite of the average reader\u2019s better rather than worse life circumstances, in spite of our living in peace times rather than in war times, or hunger times, or pestilential times, or \u2018disappeared\u2019 times, in spite of the advances in technology we enjoy, in spite of life, there is always and only death. There but for...nothing, we all will die. That\u2019s how I interpreted the title. But the title viewed as a whole is only part of what's going on here; Smith wants us to view it in sections too: There. But. For. The. And the sections serve to reveal the whole. The sections allow many interesting things to happen,, many big themes to be thrashed out.\u00a0For this book is about happenings and there is certainly a lot happening; bad things, sad things but sometimes miraculously brave things too. Some of the characters make things happen, others are acted upon in a kind of parallel with the artist/spectator relationship. Smith is the artist, manipulating events so that we, the readers, are caught up in the spectacle. To paraphrase herself, Smith catches us at exactly the moment of letting us go, she defies belief and then shows us that we were wrong ever to doubt her. For with Smith, we laugh until we cry and then we cry until we laugh again. The really funny thing is that I'm reading Proust at the moment and I can't help noticing the similar themes which emerge in these radically different books. The action of this book takes place mostly in Greenwich and one of the major themes is Time. There but for the is, in its own way, a search for lost time. And once I\u2019d noticed this initial parallel with Proust, I found more and more convergences between the two books, and was pleased when Smith briefly mentions Proust, along with Joyce, near the end. The narrative of this novel takes us through forgotten time, remembered time, fugitive time, historical time, chronological time, dream time. The journey through time, just as in Proust, is enabled partly by music and song lyrics, partly through references to the performances of great artists of the past. Gracie Fields in one, Sarah Bernhardt in the other, rhyming couplets in one, alexandrine verse in the other. Mother obsessions in both, a precocious child in both and always, always, time passing, history happening."}, {"userName": "Patrick", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/692475-patrick", "userReview": "Will you remember me in a months time?Yes.Will you remember me in 6 months time?Yes.Will you remember me in a years time?Yes.Will you remember me in 2 years time?Yes.Will you remember me in 3 years time?Yes.Knock knock.Who's there?See, you've forgotten me already.I used to work at a video store in college. It was a small mom and pop shop, and it was a great place to work. Since it was such a small operation, there were only a handful of other employees and I knew everyone pretty well. So you can imagine my surprise when a former co-worker and I were conversing about the old days, and she brought up a person who worked there that I had completely forgotten about. And when I say completely forgotten about, I don't mean like someone I hadn't thought about much in the intervening years, how are they doing these days? I mean like, I completely forgot this person existed. This is a person I saw three or four times a week for something like a year or more, and I completely forgot they existed. And I'm not even 30.But that's life, right? How many times have you promised to stay in touch with an old co-worker or a friend who was moving away, and you do, for a little while. But then the time between emails lags a little more, and a little more, and then they stop coming at all, and then you find yourself 10 years down the road realizing you have completely forgotten this person. We're constantly creating new experiences, meeting new people, making new memories, and there's only so much room in our brains. Sometimes things get pushed aside, even things that we really appreciated in the moment. At the same time, there are other things we wish we could push aside and forget about forever, banish to a graveyard with all those old co-workers and classmates, yet, no matter how hard we try, we just can't forget.That's what There But For The is about. Ostensibly it's about a man who, during a dinner party, locks himself in a guest room and doesn't come out for months. But really, it's about relationships, and they way we simultaneously hold onto some so tightly, while letting others slip through our fingers without giving it a second thought. The central character, Miles Garth, is seen only through the periphery of four characters who have gotten to know him in some limited capacity over the course of his life, and his sweetly tragic personality is doled out in bits and pieces. He is almost a more subdued, British version of Salinger's doomed hero Seymour Glass, due to his coy, unassuming nature and his preference to interact with children than adults, an answer to the premature loss of his own childhood. The four characters whose past interaction with Miles make up the story are each sweet but tragic in their own way, as I would guess all of us are to some extent. We've all had dead loved ones, or been picked on by peers (or, worse, supposed mentors), or dead-end jobs, or other small, personal tragedies that make us human. We all get on just fine, thank you, but it does leave a sadness, lingering just below that surface, that perhaps we can't quite put our fingers on. But sometimes, like a long-forgotten friend, it comes bursting to the surface, and we can't help but be overcome by it. At times like those, we all just want to go into our own little 5x7 room and stay there until we're ready to face the world again. And that's what this book is about."}, {"userName": "Aubrey", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4119460-aubrey", "userReview": "I'm going to start ignoring ratings.

I thought I wouldn't be reading Women and Men at the time or wouldn't have read all those assonant kerfuffles of hardback and paper so akin, so keep in mind my interest in things like these if you're looking for a similar touch. This book is clean, this book is crisp, and it'll call you and cut you in ways usually preserved in the classics and canon and everything written before what I'm living now. It wears one down when the crowded consensus crows that contemporary literature hasn't a prayer in these heretical times with no dead white males still kicking like it's Manifest Destiny in the fog of a PoMoic puff, so pardon my invoking of a catechism of kiddy-past Catholicism, but this book is a cross, and these are the demons.The heart of them is this best of all possible worlds complex, this sell-your-soul-for-your-comforts-sake sing-along and nobody cares. People talk of crap literature today and perhaps it's different across the water, it sure looks different when authors like Ali Smith can write this and be respected for it and perhaps not have to worry so much about debt, and socioeconomic machines, and the fact is the face of US literature is being beaten to a pulp by derision, starvation, and shame.

You make software engineering the most fertile career, you idolize the Apple and its shiny China factories, you incorporate every digital nitpick into a monstrosity of finance and political machinations and ignore the average age of all these causes in favor of the burgeoning generation to come, but wait. No politics either, remember? Or religion, but seeing as how that last paragraph blew the sentiment to shreds, we'll just have to accept the fact is we are living in a war where following the latest sensationalized third world tragedy from the corner and being grateful for your relative privilege and spankin' new drones does not make you a better person. It makes you free to be exactly as you're told to be, consumerism guaranteed and intellectualism too so long as it's the right type of ideology; so long as you are, too.Loving this book means knowing the dystopia and how multimillion dollar the begging and pleading to differ in front of the young ones currently is. Loving this book means not blaming the young ones for this they are given, for none of you had a childhood with you in control.

Loving this book makes you stone cold in the being of the very few, and knowing that it is worth it. Loving this book means knowing you have my trust to not need the usual namedrops, for this is not a quickfix direction to your next compatible guarantee.

Her latest novel, circa October 2011, shares a structure all but identical to The Accidental\u2014four sections with little one-two-page prefaces\u2014but also shares its masterful grasp over narrative voice, language, style, humour, and subtly heartbreaking strangeness.The title refers to the first word in a significant phrase deployed in each section of the novel. For example, in the first part \u2018There I was\u2019 is used when the character Anna is speaking to someone about journalism (which can be summed up in six words: I was there, there I was), and later \u2018The fact is\u2019 is used by precocious child Brooke for her little book of facts. These words and their significance within the narrative allude to the book\u2019s questions of representation and presentation, both in a literary sense, and in broader notions of reality.The novel\u2019s four strands revolve around an opaque stranger named Miles who attends a dinner party and locks himself inside his host\u2019s spare room, thenceforth refusing to budge. The reasons behind Miles\u2019s motivation are never made clear, and the event is merely a pull for the four protagonists, each rendered in a breathtaking close third-person style that demonstrates the truly balletic skill Smith has with language. At the heart of this book\u2014and it seems a lot of her work\u2014is a fascination with storytelling itself and how language distorts and enriches our understanding of life in equal measures, and how baffling and wonderful words can be, whether their meanings are monstrous or delightful.The novel plays elaborate games with chronology in frequent bracketed sections (the structural design of which eludes me) but There but for the is another lovingly designed work of art, bordering on masterpiece, from my newly crowned Favourite Ever Scottish Writer."}, {"userName": "Jimmy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1325473-jimmy", "userReview": "THEREis no there there, Gertrude Stein famously wrote in 1937, a sentence that loops back on itself in order to question its own grammar. Maybe what she meant was that the first there has no antecedent. But the sentence also pushes out, questions the world, questions the idea of a place in time, a time in place, that exists only because it is not here, relatively speaking.This novel has a similar trajectory. Broken down into four sections titled There, But, For, and The, it tells an abstract story that questions the meaning of those words. Which may seem slight at first (Duh!), except it's not. Like the puns that the child Brooke is obsessed with, the book convinces us that semantics matter, words matter. And what seems an unlikely story about a man who's locked himself into a room is really a story about how we label our world. Which is really a story about how we think about the world. Which is really about if we can even think about the world (or know it).Because a pun is basically a mislabelling that creates pleasure. A misnomer. And this book has many. Brooke becomes broke. Miles becomes Milo. Gen becomes Jan. Anna Hardie becomes Anna K. And like a good pun, this book is playful and gives pleasure. It is funny,BUTnot in a ha-ha way. More in an aha way. There is always a but, isn't there? Actually there are many buts. Time and place, memory, history, a rhyme that jogs the memory into thinking of a time and place (where a man jogs in place, or does he ride in place, on an exercise bike?), the ostensible seemingness of things versus The Fact Is of things, these were all seamlessly (seemlessly?) weaved into the prose with great skill. Butthen there were things that made me roll my eyes: cell phones, CCTVs, surveillance cameras, microdrones, celebrity culture, internet porn were all conspicuously annoying in the story. Yes, these are important things to think about, but do we really need to be reminded of the obvious (Duh!)? Come to think of it, have any of these things ever made it into a novel that wasn't trying to show me the shallowness of modern life? I felt like Don DeLillo was breathing down my back. Andthough I loved the first two sections, the last two felt weaker, in the voice of the elderly Mrs. Young and the young girl(y) Brooke (\"broke\") Bayoude. Brooke was tolerable, adorable even, when she would only be precociously naive about something during a tense dinner conversation. But being entirely in her head by the last section was too much for me. I got annoyed. ButI do like the idea of them. Maybe Smith is suggesting that when our collective language breaks down, when we can't name things as they are anymore but only as they seem, when language is \"broken\", that somehow it is most alive, and most alive to those who themselves are \"broken\", or superfluous to society, the very old and the very young. Because language, in the normal world, isFORsomething: a purpose. Communication or business or banter. And when it is functioning it is functional and boring. Like a machine. You're either for us or against us. Zeroes and/or ones.Old Mrs. Young couldn't talk at first. But when she was finally able to, the words that came out of her resembled involuntary movements she couldn't control. Like her bladder. Animal utterances. Muscle memory. Phrases she knew but didn't mean to say. Like a bird who repeats things that she doesn't understand. But her age is an asset. \"The leaving of life, when it came, might well be accompanied by a different seeing\" (p. 142). And Brooke, the child, on the other hand, who is yet to find language functionalis also accompanied by a different seeing. She sees words strangely, as a tiger cub does when batting around its first prey rather than eating it. She's curious about language, about the way it works and still fresh to its odd pun-like qualities. Here is where language belongs. Something about history and the long stretched canvas of language that is best kept by the young and the old, the ones who don't matter as much in society, the overlooked ones, the the.Thus language is made new again through puns and cleverness. You get a sense that if Brooke never completely grows up, but grows older, she could become Ali Smith and write an incredibly clever book like this. The way the storylines connect, the way the wordplay resonates between the sections and the themes, pretty much everything about this novel was clever. But in its examination of words, the novel also examines itself, and the topic of cleverness: what is cleverness for? No doubt a pre-emptive strike against those would-be critics on Goodreads:Then she asked Mr. Garth did he really think there wasn't anything wrong with being cleverest. Top of Mount Cleverest, Mr. Garth said. Brooke laughed. Then Mr. Garth said slowly: the fact is, that at the top of any mountain you'll feel a bit dizzy because of the air up there. Cleverness is great. It's a really good thing, when you have it. And when you know how to use your cleverness, it's not that you're the cleverest any more, or are doing it to be cleverer than anyone else like it's a competition. No. Instead of being the cleverest, the thing to do is become a cleverist. i.e. the becomes a, from a specificity to a generality, we lose ourselves in the collective. Cleverness matters only in this regard: to connect. Empathy with the disenfranchised. There but for the grace of God go I.THEthe, wrote Wallace Stevens at the very end of a poem. That was it. The the.What kind of ending is that? The lack of an ending. The lack of anything, but a reference to a reference. The part left out of headlines, because it's implied. Area Man Reads Book Writes Review. The part left out is the only part that remains, for Stevens. When you eat an apple, you throw away the core. Man On Dump. No headline has the word the in it, i.e. There is no the there.Similarly There But For The has a part missing. There But For The WHAT? I want to ask. But the answer would be Exactly! What's missing is the subject of the book, the whole point of it. We're not there at all because we're missing what we're missing, so we're here. The book wouldn't exist if not for the missing ____ at the end of the The.So the book is about this missing piece, the story without a core, the center will not hold. And by the end of it we've whipped up a lot of cream without anything to put it on. All the pieces connect, but the reader still feels empty, there is no comforting explanation for the mysteries that haunt us (and that's the point). Does it matter? Does it make it less enjoyable? (My answer is no, but your Milo may vary.) We keep waiting for the revelation. The moment of understanding, of purpose. Of of course. Obviously.

An act doubtlessly bizarre by any standards of our society. And yet we don\u2019t see any of the characters pose a Why to Miles\u2019 act. Perhaps they understood? For couldn\u2019t Mark have felt the need for a room like that when being stared upon by strangers while he was speaking to his mother, now dead for forty seven years?

They didn\u2019t know the why, but perhaps, in some indirect way, they understood.There but for the, a novel about a man named Miles who locks himself in a room in a stranger\u2019s house. Well, not quite. There but for the is also about all the people you know, and have known. From the encounters that have remained special on account of their ephemerality, to those whose constant presence around you has become indispensable. Told from the point of view of four narrators - each of whom have briefly shared one path or another with Miles - we only get a tangential view of Miles. A glimpse of the ways in which he has touched their lives, big or small. We look back twenty years to meet a young Miles who had brightened up one summer for Anna. We meet the gentleman who has been visiting May on every anniversary of her daughter\u2019s death, the two bonded strongly in their shared sense of loss and grief despite having barely ever spoken. While Miles is shut behind the door, the colours he has filled in other\u2019s lives are still visible. Just like some of the encounters we have with people around us, the few hours we spend with these four narrators, too, are touching in a subtle way. Ali Smith draws characters that don\u2019t take long to become memorable. Another aspect of her writing that stands out is how clever it is, full of smart wordplay and puns. Everything else about her writing - wonderfully subdued and understated. It\u2019s tender and poignant, but never schmaltzy. It\u2019s satirical, but never caustic. It\u2019s humorous, but never over the top. I love that Smith trusts her readers, and doesn\u2019t feel the need to spoon-feed or manipulate them. Each of the narrators are given their own personality and voice. She writes with a great balance and flawlessly, and she makes it look so easy.The only But I have with the novel is with its disapproval of new fangled technology. Every generation has considered their times modern with respect to the previous one. The very things that they had perhaps denounced as modern day voodoo, have now become inseparable parts of our daily lives. Had it all been merely evil, it would have perhaps drooped and wilted somewhere along the way. There sure are negative sides to many new innovations, but it certainly isn\u2019t all black and white."}, {"userName": "Teresa", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/541416-teresa", "userReview": "If you're new to Ali Smith and think you might like her (I can easily see that she's not everyone's 'thing'), read her brilliant short stories, or the novels Hotel World or The Accidental first. I loved those. And if you have read all of Ali Smith, as I have, I think you will find that this book is merely okay, even tedious near the end, and that maybe instead it could've been another brilliant short story. Because what feels like excessive padding and way too much language-play (especially with the last section belonging to the precocious 9-year old girl, Brooke, though when she's seen from others' viewpoints, she's a great character) ends up not meaning much at all, which is uncharacteristic of Ali Smith's other work.What I did end up liking (as with the rest of her work) is the way the story ends, the way it folds upon itself, much like the tight, origami-like paper airplane described in the very first section of the book. The ending led me back to this beginning, but, unfortunately, on this revisit I didn't find as much there as I hoped I would."}, {"userName": "Rakhi Dalal", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3655942-rakhi-dalal", "userReview": "\u201cImagine if all the civilizations in the past had not known to have the imagination to look up at the sun and the moon and the stars and work out that things were connected, that those things right in front of their eyes could be connected to time and to what time is and how it works.\u201d Imagine the things in front of our eyes connected to time, to what time is and how it works in connection with memories of past or moments of present or thoughts about the future. The time; dictated by the sun and the moon and the stars and which may be few hours or few days or months or years. Imagine receiving a guest or a piece of paper which reminds you about what time of year it might be, imagine some place you may never have gone and a person you may never have met but whom you met since you went there and which triggered conversations and walk down memory lanes. Now imagine if you couldn\u2019t exactly tell the year or the month or the date or time you recall, would that make a difference in the way you recall them, in the way you feel connected. And what if you lose the perspective of time, of your age and can no longer organize your own thoughts into words. There But For The fact that the past civilizations had the imagination to work out that things were connected to time that we can, when we want, look back either a few months or years, being a certain age at some point and remember all that we once were or have become over the years. There But For The fact that we meet people, make relationships and stories, that we have memories of ourselves with them, memories that we jump in and out to ascertain a presence or absence which stirs our minds even when our body refuses to.  This work speaks of this and much more.  On the surface, this is a book about a man Miles Garth who locks himself in the spare room of his hosts one night for months, without any reason. But as we move through the four parts, we realize it is not about Miles but about the people he comes across at different times in his life. How those people, Anna, Mark, Mrs. Young and Brooke, recalling their own memories, are connected to Miles though he is just another person in the story of their lives. In a language playing with words, infused with wit, satire and puns, Smith speaks of time and memories and humans and places. Through her very clever and profound narrative, we are prompted, subtly, to inquire into one thing that matters most to us \u2013 relationships, and how they fare over time and influence us and our times to come.  We are prompted to think of books and stories and what they mean to us.\u201cThink how quiet a book is on a shelf, he said, just sitting there, unopened.

It is also a satire on the so called acceptable social virtues, on the kind of entertainment which we have today into which people desperately plunge and on the nature of people when they form masses. But above all, this work is a sparkling display of an erudite intelligence which is CLEVERIST."}, {"userName": "Tony", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33771-tony", "userReview": "There are things I now know.

And I don't know why he finally exited the room. I mean, I would have left the dinner party too. The lamb tangine sounds nice but I choke on competitive erudition and shallow assumptions. But while Miles hibernates we are treated to four people who met him in the past, barely met him. Yet each one was treated to a little kindness. With nothing expected in return. The points of view change, but none of them are Miles'. So we, the reader, become the successive others, left to ask Who Miles was? and How did he change us?

I'm holding off on Proust until a long prison term or the event of French global domination, whichever comes first.

It is not a tool for survival, my darling....It's what I like about handwriting, Mr. Garth said, that it is about time. Hell, the events occur mainly in Greenwich and especially at the Observatory. The four characters are all memorable, none more so that the precocious 10 year-old, Brooke, who really has a starring role. It is through Brooke that Smith can show off her delightful wordplay. And wisdom. The other three...(Anna, a 40 year-old Ethic Cleanser; Mark, 60, gay and adrift; and May, an incontinent octogenarian needing to flee the nursing home)...have all had Miles transect their lives, always with some unexpected kindness. But it is Brooke who meets him on his terms. They ultimately trade stories, made-up stories with alternate endings. This book affected me more deeply and more unexpectedly than I imagined."}, {"userName": "Blair", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/272909-blair", "userReview": "I just... don't know. I don't know about this book. Believe me when I say that I really wanted to love it. I 'saved' it for some time before beginning, and when I didn't feel much into it on the first try, I left it for a while and tried again. Everything (the premise, Smith's reputation, great reviews in the press and here on Goodreads) suggested it would be a wonderful, even revelatory read, and yet... I mean, maybe I've shot myself in the foot by reading so many books this year. Maybe I've got some sort of book fatigue. I always get confused when I see people reading hundreds of books a year and they're almost all the same genre; endless romance, or endless YA paranormal adventure, or endless murder mysteries. I would never judge someone else's reading habits, but I do wonder how it's possible for people to read the same type of book repeatedly - especially if they finish several per week - and not get bored of reading such similar things over and over again.The problem with this book, then, is that I feel like I've already read it several times this year. Back in the days when I read about 10-20 books a year, there's every possibility I would have been blown away by this, thought it was an absolute masterpiece. But what I've begun to realise recently is that there's a certain type of acclaimed literary novel that can be every bit as predictable as its trashier equivalent. These books are always loosely constructed around some sort of plot idea but aren't really 'about' whatever that is; they always rely heavily on themes of memory, loss, regret, grief and how we relate to others; the narrator/s is/are usually someone old, or older, looking back and reflecting on events from their childhood and younger life; the meaning and significance of language, how we choose to use it, and the formation of stories about our lives/ourselves invariably play a key role. Examples from my reading of this year alone are: Great House, Landfall, The Blue Book, The Sense of an Ending, The Sea, The Gathering, The Finkler Question, to some extent The Corrections and a couple of Paul Auster's books. All of these can, at least loosely, be said to fit into the above description. In particular, The Sense of an Ending and The Blue Book are incredibly similar to There but for the, to the point that they could almost have been written by the same person.To summarise the story, it's 'about' a man, Miles, who goes upstairs during a dinner party with a group of people he barely knows, locks himself in a spare bedroom, and refuses to come out. This event forms a background for a series of narratives from people loosely connected to Miles. There's Anna, a vague acquaintance from many years ago; Mark, who brought Miles to the party, although the pair had only met briefly before this; May, an elderly woman seemingly facing the end of her life in hospital, whose connections to the dinner-party characters are very slowly revealed; and finally, Brooke, an extremely precocious 10-year-old also present at the party. The narratives are written in the third person, but offer an intimate insight into the characters' thought processes. There are tangents, diversions and recollections galore as the characters explore what their relationships to one another mean, question themselves and dredge up long-lost memories. Brooke's chapter is the best, a lively stream-of-consciousness filled with jokes and puns, witty and clever but, in the end, perhaps a bit pointless.There is no doubt that Ali Smith is a brilliant writer. Her wordplay and use of language are absolutely wonderful and the characterisation is equally skilful. But I didn't connect with the story, I didn't engage with the narratives, I wasn't desperate to go back to the book whenever I had to put it down; I just didn't like it all that much, to be honest. Sound familiar? It's what I've thought about at least half of the books I listed above. Great writing is great writing, but that alone is not enough to make a great story. Whenever I don't like a literary novel the critics have been raving about, I worry it's because I'm too stupid to truly appreciate it; but I'm really pretty sure that wasn't the case with this. I completely understood everything I was supposed to love about it, it simply failed to elicit any sort of emotional response from me. Sadly, this is another book I very much admired but didn't much enjoy."}, {"userName": "BrokenTune", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10592271-brokentune", "userReview": "\"But the fact is, how do you know anything is true?

Plots are merely vehicles to convey sub-plots, ideas, sentiments, and impressions of the world around us. So writing about how There But For The tells about the story of a man who is invited to a dinner party, gets up, and locks himself into a room in his host's house for months is an inadequate description. Even going on to say that the book also tells the stories of the people around the mysterious hermit guest will not do. Instead, I am going to say that There But For The is a story about underdogs with at least three main characters - my favourite of which is Brooke.Brooke is a highly intelligent, sensitive child who is bullied by a teacher. She starts to withdraw from her peers and her family and find solace in learning about history.  \"So people in authority should be more careful because having your head on a coin doesn\u2019t mean you are immune to history like people are immune to things they have been inoculated against by a doctor. Just because someone is in authority, for example in charge of you, and can get you by the arm when no one will know so that your arm afterwards really hurts, and shout in your ear, so loud so that it feels like a slap and your ear can feel the words in it for quite some time after, it doesn\u2019t mean history won\u2019t happen back to them.\"But Brooke is not set on revenge. She is compassionate, inquisitive, and caring - traits she shares with the other heroes in Smith's story.\"What I am feeling is irrelevant, Brooke said, but if you are feeling for all those people, that is an astronomical amount of feeling.It is an Alps of feeling, her mother said, and what you are feeling is never irrelevant, and I feel an Alps of feeling about that too.\"And, yet, even with all those layers of characters and story lines and observing the subtleties of life yet, there is always more to an Ali Smith story than the story it self. There is always the writing. I love Smith's ability to use words, to play with sounds and meanings and, best of all, to conjure up images which correspond with my sense of quirky humor.\"Now the Queen is sitting in front of a screen.

Not cool, Ali Smith. The masses were bleating favorably about the novel \u201cThere But For The\u201d and frankly the premise seemed so intriguing: A man at a dinner party with a collection of strangers gets up, goes upstairs and locks himself in a spare room -- luckily one with a bathroom, unfortunately at a house not very sympathetic to his vegetarian diet. He refuses to come out for days, for weeks, until he becomes a folk hero and the locals camp out and wait for a glimpse of him. This is such a great idea. Who is Miles? (Or Milo, as he\u2019s being referred to by the media). What\u2019s he doing in there? (Is he talking to himself? Pacing? Moving from furniture surface to furniture surface, like the star of a super hot one-man show, a dramatization of the circumstances, that is playing at a small local theater?) And mostly: Why did he do this? We\u2019ll never know. Instead of capturing the story\u2019s most mysterious character, Smith dances around the outside. She presents short stories about people who have known Miles pre-lock down: A woman named Anna who met him while abroad in 1980 with other students, winners of a writing contest where entrants considered life in 2000. The Scottish misfit is having a wretched time until Miles finds a common interest with her, engages in some witty word-play banter, and provides her entry into the group. Then there is my favorite, Mark, an older dude who meets Miles while at a production of \u201cA Winter\u2019s Tale\u201d and they find the beginning of friendship while considering whether the mistimed ringtone from the audience ruined the moment or added to it. They end up going for drinks to chat more, and Mark invites Miles to the dinner party. May is an elderly woman who has had a stroke. She\u2019s seemingly unable to speak, shocked by her own aged body, a little confused and memories are shooting through her mind -- including movies she saw when she was a teen and an old friend of her daughter, who died when she was young. In a last gasp for life, a girl (who is related to the owners of the home where Miles is locked in) takes May on an adventure that doesn\u2019t end well. Miles was friends with May\u2019s daughter and after the young girl\u2019s death he makes a yearly visit to the elderly woman on the anniversary of her death. The final word goes to Brooke, a tween who is just a little too smart, enjoys puns and history, a quirky and curious daughter of two intellectuals. She also thinks and talks in a rapid flow, stream of consciousness. It\u2019s like, kudos on character development, unfortunately her voice felt like someone was picking at a scab on my brain. As for Miles? No idea. We learn little about him beyond what these people remember: He was a kind teen, a good conversationalist, a thoughtful man and a vegetarian. There were times when I liked this story. To be fair, each of the short stories is an interesting slice. And the dinner party hosted by Gen Lee is a kick. She and her husband invite a bunch of mostly-strangers and then see what happens. It\u2019s just something they do. This time they\u2019ve paired smart and articulate neighbors with a man Mark has secretly been banging (and his wife) and a few loud mouth idiots who hate art. The result is the most uncomfortable dinner party, you\u2019ll actually squirm, in the history of placemats. There is also some commentary on becoming a pop icon. The people gathered in the yard, selling Miles-themed T-shirts and psychic readings and holding signs. Gen Lee, the homeowner, first extremely put out by the intrusion, then finds ways to turn it into a money-making venture. But these little nuggets are few and far between tedious passages. But the elephant in the room, or the unwanted guest in the room, is Miles. There are, admittedly, a lot of reasons to lock oneself in a stranger\u2019s spare room. We\u2019re all just a single impulse-control glitch from doing some pretty uncharacteristic stuff: punching the accelerator, shoplifting cheap lipstick, chopping all our hair off. Or maybe he is exhausted. Like my friend Hank used to say: \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t want to hole up in a padded room and play some balloon volleyball for awhile?\u201d Maybe he\u2019s on the lam from the mob or an overbearing mother. The point is, there is no right reason. And that bugs. You know what this is, Ali Smith?

But delivered, of course, \"Ali Style.\" So, the framework of the novel, on which these themes hang, is that a dinner guest has locked himself in the guest room of his host's house - which is an awesome premise, but it's not what the book is \"about.\"Because Smith is awesome and a trickster, the book is loaded with wordplay and other devices supportive of her themes. For one, the whole thing is set in Greenwich, as in \"GMT\" - yes, a once-center of Western world thinking about and organization of Time and Space. This was a fascinating setting and Smith has fun letting various characters delve into its loaded architecture and history - and, even more fraught, the fact that the historic observatory is now rather defunct, primarily a tourist attraction, no longer the active site of Thought Leadership of Time and Space. I've read 1.5 books by Smith thus far, and she's clearly pretty obsessed with the ephemeral nature of human achievement and \"advancement.\" Smith uses 4 sections and 4 narrators to tell a story around the story of Miles Garth, the locked-in dinner guest. (Plus each section is followed by a fragment of correspondence from Miles.) Section 1 is \"There,\" which is very much about place, and tells the story of Anna, who was acquainted with Miles briefly in their teens and who has been summoned to Greenwich by Gen(evieve) Lee, the homeowner and dinner party-thrower who has now become the unwilling host of Miles. Gen finds Anna on the palimpsest of Miles' phone and commands her presence to solve the problem of Miles. Through Anna's recollection of Miles, we start to learn about his character and how he helped Anna achieve a sense of empowerment or belonging when she, too, was in a place of at least feeling like an unwelcome or entrapped guest. These memories (as well as Gen's own character, and Anna's recent experience in a bureaucratic government job vetting whether immigrants' stories are worthy of refuge and whether they get to leave or stay) influence how Anna chooses to deal with the situation and how the events thus unfold. (Ali, you are so coy and multilayered!)Section 2, \"But,\" is about exceptions, among other things (and because this is Smith, there is also a whole meditation on conjunctions and but vs. and - but anyway). This section is narrated by Mark, who brought Miles to dinner on a whim after a series of exceptional circumstances. The whole dinner itself was intended to bring together strangers who would not normally meet and mingle But for the occasion of this dinner - a circumstance from which Miles is at least twice removed, as he is the surprise plus-one guest of a man he himself barely knows and has only met once before. We learn about Miles' character as an adult in this section, and also get to be dazzled by Smith's spot-on depiction of the most terrible dinner party ever, hosted and attended by many of the most awful people imaginable.I keep mentioning Miles' character and so here I should just confess that I think it's a great one, akin to Simon in Lord of the Flies. Miles functions as kind of a representative of being kind and decent and moral, and having empathy. In fact, he's an ethical consultant, which makes it all the more hilarious that his encounter with the horrible Gen Lee and her dinner guests prompts him to stage a kind of on-site, shutdown/sit-in. We've all been there, at least emotionally.In keeping with that - Section 3 is \"For\" and deals with giving, caring, connection, and service. It's told from the point of view of May Young, a feisty elderly woman sick in hospital, who reflects back on her life with her now-deceased husband, a serviceman, and their time spent raising her children. At this point in the novel, Smith starts to deftly bring together the characters and threads, so to say more would spoil it, but suffice it to say we learn more about Miles in this section too, and he plays a significant and meaningful role in her life.Finally, Section 4, \"The,\" wraps things up and is told from the point of view of Brooke, a young girl who is a neighbor of Gen, was (like Miles) an unwelcome/uninvited guest at the infamous dinner (along with her scholar parents), and so is also heavily featured in Sections 1 and 2 (and knows Miles, Anna, and Mark). Brooke is \"the definite article\" herself and is also obsessed with understanding and meaning and truth and history and facts as she tries to make sense of the world (and its occasional cruelty and randomness). Brooke, with her youthful and idealistic thirst for resolution, and her quirky and precocious, professorial-parents-nurtured mind, is a great vehicle through which to wrap up the story of/around Miles. Smith also unfurls a revelation about Brooke's character that we receive well into the book, after we've already formed initial impressions of her - it's masterful and supports the book's themes.All these characters - not just Miles, but May, Mark, Anna, and Brooke - are fabulous: imperfect and real and sympathetic. How Smith can so fluently inhabit the mind of an elderly ill woman, a middle-aged gay man, and a tweenage child of academics is utterly beyond me. (Based on this and How To Be Both - she writes intelligent, inquisitive, sensitive, creative teen/tween girls better than anyone.) She is a shapeshifter.Moreover - Smith achieves the amazing feat of writing these erudite literary novels that superficially appear experimental, but the awesome thing is that if you just give yourself over to the masterful rhythm of her prose - the narration/dialogue just \"speaks\" itself as if you are hearing a play written by a great writer and performed by great actors. She just has such an amazing sense of how people talk and think and what they talk and think about.AND - the book deals with serious and weighty matters and looks all fancy-literary-like, but is also effing FUNNY! Smith beautifully portrays the gorgeousness of human foibles and our flawed humanity. She is refreshingly optimistic in her outlook while also not shying away from looking honestly and directly at the horrors.I'm not gonna lie, I cried at the end of this. Ali Smith, keep on writing things or I'll find you and barricade myself in your guest room until you do!"}, {"userName": "Christopher", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11233506-christopher", "userReview": "There but for the grace of god go I. A story of a man with the sensibilities of a jesus. He goes to a dinner party and perhaps he\u2019s no longer able to take the uncouthness of the outside world and so he retreats into a room, an impromptu move. And so, in that spirit, we say yes. We say yes, and? The form is quite nice, a third person limited type thing, following characters by turns. The voices are of course, nearly pitch perfect (it is Ali Smith after all). But I didn\u2019t really like the old lady character too much (not an a priori position). It\u2019s because this character seemed like a sketch written for a workshop. She seems to simply show that Miles made a point of charity out of visiting and that was so important because it was without reason or expectation, so meaningful and small an act of human compassion that even when his yearly presence threatens to be disrupted by his own despair, he sends a proxy. He\u2019s so other-directed that this gesture is enough to awaken a near-catatonic. But the Anna section was enough for me to have this feel. And so, while I would have liked a chapter through Miles, it is denied. But buck up chief. We can\u2019t knock a book because it is not the book we want it to be. We must look at the book it is. And it is a very good book. One that asks us to write our own Miles chapter by turning away from ourselves and towards others."}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57090347-maria", "userReview": "I really liked the premise of this book. A man is invited to a dinner party. He doesn't know the hosts. In the middle of the party, he locks himself in the upstairs guestroom and refuses to come out. He stays in there for months, and becomes somewhat of a local celebrity because of this.This man - Miles - is the nucleus of the story. The reader are invited into the lives of people surrounding him, mostly people he doesn't know very well. Acquaintances. People who have crossed paths with him somehow. It's like we are circling around him, trying to get closer and closer. But Miles never gets to tell his own story. We only get to see him through other people's eyes. As usual, Smith's language is outstanding, playful, and inventive, for the most part. She explores the meaning and usage of words in fascinating ways. She gives us little stories inside of stories, usually interesting, sad, or funny. But there were a couple of sections in this book - rather long sections - that failed to interest me. A few times the stories strayed too far from Miles and the central topic/concept of the book. Not that everything has to be about Miles, but I ended up feeling like this book presented me with a series of people and stories so loosely connected that there was no coherent whole. This is most prominent in the chapter about May. This part definitely it dragged on for too long and was just a bit boring to get through. And the connection she has to Miles is only very superficial. The chapter about May could have been a separate short story. So I was a bit disappointed. The brilliance of Ali Smith, that carried me all the way through How to be both, came and went several times throughout There But for The. This seems to be the way it has to be, with me and my favorite authors. Some of their books I absolutely love, while other works are just ok. This one is a bit better than ok, though. It is a good gook. But it only gets three stars from me."}, {"userName": "Larou", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7821634-larou", "userReview": "If you look really closely, this book does have a plot; it would go something like this: Man withdraws from dinner party to barricade himself in a guest room at his hosts\u2019 house, stays for several months, then leaves without telling anyone. Which, no matter how you view it, really is not much in the way of a plot \u2013 but then plot is not what Ali Smith\u2019s novel There but for the is about.What the novel is about is history, both public and private, about knowledge of the world, of ourselves and of other people, about how people are mean to each or kind to each other, and about how to cope. It is also about it five protagonists (as well as a host of secondary characters), four of which narrate one of the four sections of the book (each of the sections named after one of the four words of the title, and also being about that word in some way), the fifth being the person locking himself away in the guestroom. He is something like the empty centre of the novel, and each of the narrators stands in some kind of relation to him. The narrators not only have distinct personalities but also a distinctive voice of their own (although there also is an auctorial voice slipping in some passages in between parentheses) and one of the many things that make this a remarkable novel is the apparent with which Ali Smith manages to make each of her narrators sound like her or (in one case) his own individual while still maintaining her own unique writing style. The author\u2019s mastery is also very much in evidence in the many descriptive passages in the book that can range from the hauntingly beautiful to the scathingly satirical, and while this is definitely not a realistic novel, it is still very evocative of places and atmosphere.The narrators are spread across the whole human age range \u2013 40, 60, 80 and 10 years old respectively. This not only gives the author the chance to illuminate the experience of present day life from all sides, so to speak (and indeed, considering its emphasis on seeing the same things from various perspectives and angles as well as its almost total absence of plot and its many descriptive passages I\u2019d almost feel inclined to call There but for the a Cubist novel) but also shows a nice example of the way Smith throughout the novel builds structure and symmetry without becoming repetitive and predictable but instead uses them in surprising and significant ways. The above sequence of narrator ranges suggests death and rebirth to me \u2013 and indeed, in the book's final section there is (something like) an opened tomb with the stone moved aside and (something more or less like) an angel announcing that the place is empty. There is also at least a hint of a cyclic movement involved which mirrors the circular structure the novel achieves (in what I thought was a very clever twist) at its end.The novel is not just a formal exercise, though, far from it \u2013 not only is it politically very aware, taking a firm stance against racism and middle class hypocrisy but it also is emotionally very involving, delivering very sympathetic portraits of its main characters, making the reader feel with and for them. It is a very touching novel without being manipulative and without making any compromises with conventional narrative structures.There but for the is a great novel that is unflinching in the pursuit of its artistic vision and dares to stray off the beaten path and do something that is entirely its own, and does so with a rare and delightful mastery of language and imagery, an exuberant inventiveness in structure and composition while being at same time emotionally involving and enjoyable to read. By now it\u2019s probably obvious to everyone that I loved this book, and am definitely going to read more of Ali Smith\u2019s works."}, {"userName": "Fiona", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7232207-fiona", "userReview": "You're going to have to help me out with this one, because my Not A Real Reader neurosis has turned out in droves. What's the deal with this book?This is my first foray into Ali Smith's fiction, and I've variously heard her described as experimental, one of fiction's enthusiasts, erudite and off-beat, and groundbreaking. This book in particular is apparently \"sparklingly satirical\". Did someone replace it with a different book when I wasn't looking? I'm not asking for a State of the Nation address, nor to be smacked around the skull with the satire or enthusiasm or whatever, but I've never read a book where the description of it has been so very at odds with my own experience of reading it. And - I've read some of your reviews, and I still don't understand what you saw.So, look. I've seen Ali Smith speaking at the Edinburgh Book Festival, so I know that she really is clever and witty and enthusiastic. Which leads me to the conclusion that the emperor is in fact wearing clothes, and there is something going on that I've just... skipped over, somehow. Missed. Ignored. Vibrated out of sync with. And I would love to see that thing.This has happened to me before - I'm pretty sure it's happened to most readers before, and sometimes, you just have to put up with the fact that some things are not to your taste. But this isn't like that. It's not that the good bits of There but for the fell flat for me, it's that I can't even see where the non-flat bits might be. This isn't a Dune situation. It's an Umberto Eco one - I need to tune into it properly. Which means I need a bit of help.This is a genuine plea, then, for somebody to give me tasting notes on this book. What specifically ought I be looking at? Which bits made you particularly happy, and why? And I promise to go back and look over them, and see if I can't read this book from someone else's perspective. Because I am Perplexed of Edinburgh, right now, and I want to know what it is that I'm missing.Thank you in advance if this is something you can help with.

In THE ACCIDENTAL, an uninvited woman shows up at a residence and turns the family upside down. In her latest novel, Miles Garth, a dinner party guest in Greenwich, leaves the dinner table, exits upstairs, locks himself in the spare room, and declines to leave. Miles is the nominal central figure of the novel, yet it is his \u201cabsent presence\u201d and other paradoxes of human nature that are pivotal. His silence is the roar that emanates alienation.The main characters of the four chapters, entitled There, But, For and The respectively, experience a pressing solitude (one character describes the Internet as \u201ca whole new way of feeling lonely\u201d). Three have met Miles at some point in their lives, but none of them know him intimately. Anna, who is also known as Anna K (as in Kafka\u2019s THE TRIAL; or anarchy; or \u201cAnna Key in the UK,\u201d a Sex Pistols cover), knew Miles briefly as a teenager when they both won an academic competition to travel to various European cities. She remembers him as confident, spirited, and arch. Anna\u2019s former job at the Center for Temporary Permanence is reminiscent of Jonas\u2019s in HOW TO READ THE AIR. As senior liaison, she condensed the trauma stories of individuals so that their narratives fit onto one page of a document. \u201cYou have exactly the right kind of absent presence,\u201d her former boss tells her, referring to her forced remoteness from her clients. Temporary permanence and absent presence amplify the tragic isolation of contemporary society. Now in her 40\u2019s, Anna is experiencing an existential crisis of identity and alienation.Mark met Miles at a local theater production of A WINTER\u2019S TALE, and initially tried to pick him up. They began a friendship over their opposite responses to a cell phone going off during the play, and Mark subsequently brought Miles to the dinner party hosted by Gen and Eric (Gen-Eric, a pun). Mark has been plagued for decades by his dead mother\u2019s voice whispering into his ear in rhyming couplets. Her absence is a constant presence in his life.A dying, elderly woman\u2019s connection to Miles is not apparent at first. She is in the hospital, gradually losing her grip on reality, and determined not to be sent to a nursing home. Her status as sick and old illustrates the tacit ageism of society, as others regard her as invisible while they manage and condescend to her.The true central character is Brooke, the almost ten-year-old child of one of the dinner party couples. Brooke is too remarkably precious and inauthentic-- a provocative child prodigy who thinks, talks, and usually writes like a post-grad student. She is familiar with the text and nuances of HAMLET, as well as other references to lofty literature and obscure esoterica. Can\u2019t children just be children in literature anymore? It borders on gimmicky. Brook\u2019s dialogue and interior monologues, however, are weighted with the gravitas of the novel. She is loaded with punny ideas, references to Mean Greenwich Time, and her attraction to the Greenwich foot tunnel invokes the infinite coil of memory and history. Her behavior toward others is unimpeachable, yet drenched in irony. Unfortunately, Brooke feels less like a real character than a bridge between the text and Smith\u2019s ideas.Smith is a high-wire artist of the nonlinear storyline, and a conjurer of experimental, hyperkinetic prose. The elastic and slanted wordplay revolve around isolation and identity. But Smith overtaxes the narrative with voguish stream-of-consciousness during the latter part of the story. It exaggerates and escalates to the point of burlesque, and removes the reader from the narrative tension into the staginess of its performance. The manic flow of prose floods the reader with its self-awareness.Some of its parts are exquisite and heartbreaking, but the sum of its parts is less than some of its parts. The combination of typecast characters and pc heavy-handedness is stultifying. The middle-class white people are boorish philistines. The gay and ethnic characters, as well as the precocious Brooke, are paragons of temperance and sensitivity.The themes prevail, but the lush linguistics and hurricane of words crushes the characters underfoot, and the clich\u00e9d stereotypes are laden with the very middle-class pieties that Smith aims to send up, allocated to types. Moreover, the visceral opening of the novel diminishes in her cerebral profusion of the last fourth of the book and threatens to vanish with Miles behind the closed door.A must-read for fans of the author, it may also appeal to readers seeking experimental prose and unconventional narrative structure."}], "description": "At a dinner party in the posh London suburb of Greenwich, Miles Garth suddenly leaves the table midway through the meal, locks himself in an upstairs room, and refuses to leave.
