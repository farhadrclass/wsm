The GoodFlesh Craving...There is no need to summarize this book because Baker did an excellent job of that in his own book summary. So let's get down to the nitty-gritty. I loved this book so much I had a hankering for some flesh once I turned the last page. After satisfying my hunger by chewing on my pinkie for a bit, you couldn't stop me from spreading my love of this book. A zombie book is a zombie book, until you read Rotter World. A story of raw emotion, gore beyond comprehension, and the lengths self-righteous people will go to justify their hate. The Leader...We spend a lot of time in the perspective of Mike Robson, once an officer of the law, now the leader of the team that goes into the thick of zombie territory to find supplies and survivors. Mike was the perfect hero. Loyal to a fault, caring but strict when needed, and a strong sense of morals. He is the kind of guy you would want to follow. I knew with him leading the group, with him being the voice of reason that no matter how bad things got, he would find a way to help the others survive. Angels of Death...Natalie was another great character. She was the leader of the Angels of Death, a group of girls who she taught to shoot a gun and take care of themselves. The stories of what these girls had to go through to survive were gut-wrenching. The many rape gangs roving the world has made zombie-land even more terrifying for the female population. Natalie showed these women who have been victimized to fight and survive. I love reading about women who don't let their horrible pasts dictate who they are now. It added a lot of emotion to the novel that made me feel for the characters even more. Zombies vs. Vampires...I loved the added twist of vampires amongst the Zombie Apocalypse. I really felt bad for them though. Their brethren had pretty much started the end of the world by releasing this virus on the population. Too bad for the vampires that they were not immune to the virus either. Now there are only a few vamps left in the world and almost every human would relish wiping them out. The vampires aren't too keen on having to rely on humans to survive. They need someone to watch over them during the daylight hours. This vulnerability only strengthens the vampires' hatred for the humans that wish them dead. Dravko was the secondary leader of the small vamp group, and he did a great job of keeping them safe. He remained logical the whole time, never letting his emotions get the best of him. He knew who was a threat to his team, and which humans he could trust. I like how some of the humans and vamps started to work together as a common threat emerged. Humanity is Gone...The themes in this book were thought-provoking: How human frailty can destroy communities. How disaster rarely brings people together, but dismantles the basic structure of humanity. How morals and chivalry are often set aside as each person fights for their own life. How to some people hate and revenge are worth more than the rebuilding of a thriving society. I don't think anyone could really say what kind of person they will become if put in this kind of situation, but we can only hope we keep at least a thread of compassion and civilty even during the end of the world. Can't We All Just Get Along?It was so easy for the people in Rotter World to blame the vampires for the destruction of life on Earth, but hate is what will continue the road of complete human elimination. When we are met with despair and a bleak future, one can only try to make things better by working together, not against one another. In Rotter World, some people just couldn't let go of their disdain and distrust and it got them killed. It also got innocents killed along the way. But Rotter World also showed us that there is always hope for humanity. Even when surviving seems impossible, there is always light at the end of the tunnel. People make mistakes but holding that against them and continuing a feud during a larger war is just counterproductive. I loved reading about a group that comes together to overcome the impossible. It made me want to cheer out loud. Zombie Apocalypse...Rotter World was gory, terrifying, and heart-wrenching. It took my breath away and made me shiver at the same time. The action was sublime and the pacing kept my attention till the last page. I couldn't put this book down. There was a constant sense of dread the whole way through. I wanted so bad for everyone to survive, but that kind of wishful thinking is useless with a zombie book. People die, we mourn, and then move on. Because after killing the first fifty zombies, a hundred take their place. The Zombie Apocalypse waits for no man...or vampire. The BadOnly two things bothered me. The beginning (after the initial zombie scene) was pretty slow but it was understandable since Baker had to introduce us to all his characters. Then there was a bit of a lull about three fourths into the book, when the crew finally gets to the underground facility. The SnugglyWe get some fun sexual tension and sex scenes. Yaaay. I like my zombie books with at least one sex scene. What the hell else are these people to do when they might be eaten any second? OverallThis is the kind of zombie book I have been looking for. Nothing was held back. I was face deep in rotting skin and gooey innards as Baker took me on the ride of my life. I loved the characters, even the bad guys. They all contributed to producing one hell of a zombie story. Highly recommended to all. Excerpt\"What's in there?\" Sam asked nervously. \"Trust me,\" said Natalie, \"you don't want to know.\"\"We'll see.\" Sam yanked Natalie off the truck, knocking her into the grass. He stepped back and spoke to the others. \"Check it out. If you find anyone inside, kill'em.\"The three gunmen climbed up onto the loading dock. The lanky one pushed aside the curtains with his AK-47 to allow the mustachioed gunman and the one in the Harley Davidson vest to enter, and then followed them inside. A moment later, a scream emanated from the back of the Ryder, followed by gun shots and a growl, an ungodly guttural sound that was neither animal nor human. All three men started screaming now, the intensity of their panic terrifying. Then, one by one, each cry devolved into a muffled gurgle. The mayhem stopped as quickly as it had started, leaving in it's place an eerie silence."}, {"userName": "Wicked \u2665  (Wickedly Bookish Reviews) aka Bat-Jess", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2082350-wicked-wickedly-bookish-reviews-aka-bat-jess", "userReview": "Wickedly Bookish Reviewshttp://wickedlybookish.blogspot.com/Eight months after the zombie apocalypse took Earth, a group of brave survivors gets a chance to make their world safe again. Dr. Compton has found a cure for the virus he inadvertently created. The catch? It's back at his lab facility hundreds of miles away through the rotter infested ruins of the American East Coast. Will Mike Robson and his crew of tenacious survivors be able to bring back the cure and take back their world, or will they die trying?Rotter World is a stomach churning, heart-pumping, zombie killing extravaganza. A true feast for the... zombie in you. I learned the hard way that it it not a wise idea to eat while you read this book. I often multi-task while reading and thought, \"Hey, I might as well finish this book up while I have some teriyaki beef and broccoli for lunch.\" Bad idea, only a few pages later I encountered a particularly detailed death scene in which one of the characters gets eaten alive. While the scene was well written and emotionally evocative, I would have preferred to keep my lunch out of it. You see, Rotter World is very much a book that spares no detail when it comes to graphic gore. While this adds to the desperate and often times disturbing tone of the book nicely, it may not be for everyone. So...you have been warned.Moving onward, Rotter World offers the reader a unique and intriguing alternate view of the zombie apocalypse in which the virus is spread by vampires in an attempt to distract humans from hunting them down. This of course backfires spectacularly on them and the vampires find themselves facing an increasingly desperate situation; the complete extinction of their kind. When the book begins, humans and what is left of the vampires have teamed up to better their chances of surviving in a hostile alliance that threatens to boil over at any moment. The tension is incredible as it offsets the already overwhelming threat of the zombie horde. Not all of the human survivors hate the vampires which also leads to another layer of hostilities among the group. I loved this, but wished that the loyalties of the characters hadn't been so obvious. I would have loved to have read a scene in which a human you thought neutral or for the vampires turned on one of them during a zombie onslaught. I love that kind of NO WAY! moment. Regardless there are plenty of action sequences and you get to see how prejudices effect the decisions of the group in life threatening situations. I won't say who, but I was very upset to see my favorite vamp go. I was like, \"Scott, oh no you didn't!\" Kill off my favorite character why don't you? Who are you, George R.R. Martin? I was sad, but it did do the trick of keeping me emotionally invested in the story. The only thing that I can really critique here is consistency. With all the action and character interaction Baker throws at us that gets our hearts pumping, some in-between scenes come across a bit dry. I know it's hard to make colorful transition scenes when you've just allowed your characters to barely escape from a hauntingly bloody battle, but there were a few times when I felt Baker's writing was becoming more technical in order to explain rather than making readers see it through the already well established interactions between characters. I stress this is only occasionally, but these parts were just so stark in comparison to the rest of the story that they really killed the mood. Speaking of \"The Mood\" Baker waxes erotic a couple of times throughout the novel showing readers both the wonderful and destructive sides of the human need for closeness. I was glad to have this part of human nature addressed within a zombie novel as the genre normally stays away from sensuality. What better motivation is there to incite DEFCON levels of the horizontal mambo than the almost definite possibility that you will be cannibalized by mindless, rotting husks of your peers in the near future? I honestly can't think of any. I know I'm outing myself as a perv here, but I genuinely wish there had been more sexy scenes, especially with the vamp, *wink wink* but I digress...I know this is becoming one mother trucker of a review, but I do have one last thing I'd like to tell you all about. I absolutely hate reading books or watching movies where the women spend more time screaming and crying than kicking-ass and taking names. Thank God for Baker's badass squad of zombie killing femme fatales. The Angels of Death are leather clad ladies with some seriously messed up pasts they have overcome by blowing away many a zombie. If there were some AOD merch like a shirt or a mug, I would be first in line to get me some. I loved these ladies who prove you best not underestimate a woman with serious baggage.The Final VerdictYou're invited to a deadman's party. Make sure you gird your loins and bring a hardy constitution, maybe even a turtleneck. That is unless you plan on fraternizing with some vamps then by all means... Enjoy the ride. ^_^FTC DisclosureI was provided a copy of this book by the author and IO tours in exchange for an honest review.

I was hesitant at first, worried that the author would not be able to use that vampire-element in order to give us a plot-line that is different from all the rest. I've seen it before where an author brings in a new element, something different, yet poor execution leads to a boring and bland plotline. If you wanna bring something different into the genre, you better well use it to make the plot itself different as well, if you fail to do so, then you're dancing to the same boring tune like everybody else. Rotter World does not fall into this category. The author does a stellar job using the vampire element to shape this story into something different and unique. I enjoyed how he used to the vampire element to shape a new spin on the story near the end.Writing: I enjoyed the writing style. Scott Baker has a straight-forward, clean and crisp writing style that brings the story to life. His descriptions can really bring the gore and his action sequences are well oriented. Writing wise: I have no qualms.Characters: Some of the characters were a little cardboard-ish but overall, the characters in the books are real. A few of them I could live without. There were also a couple of characters that could have been fleshed out a little more. (such as Natalie, O'Bannon and Mad Dog) I really wish Mad Dog was a bit more lively on the page. There was a scene with Mad Dog that I had slight issues with. The reason being that the scene could have been better if it occurred later on in the book, and if you've read the book, you'd understand the particular scene I am talking about.Plot: Riveting. This book has a great plot and the vampire element gives it an original spin on the zombie story. There is a lot of action, blood and gore and also, great conflicts. Maybe one or two of the conflicts seemed a little contrived, but overall, they were some pretty good action scenes. Also, not very zombie novels can give me an `Oh Crap!' moment,and this is mainly due to the fact that I've read a crap-load of zombie fiction and have read a lot of pretty morbid stuff. But Rotter World gave me a good `Oh Crap!' moment and the author gets bonus points for that.Overall: Rotter World stands out as one hell of a zombie novel and with a little time, it will catch on and become a popular read among fans. I think somewhere down the road, people might regard Rotter World as a Permuted Press classic and I would probably be one of the people testifying to that. This story has a great plot, good characters, strong re-read value and an excellent, unique slant on the genre."}, {"userName": "Heather Faville", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2697506-heather-faville", "userReview": "Rotter World starts off a little slow as it pieces together the back story, using flashbacks at times, of many of the characters and what has happened to cause the undead to walk and feast. The addition of vampires was a welcome one for this reader as it brought in a slightly different element to the chaos that is already at hand. Can the humans of the group trust the vampires not to feast upon them like happy meals with legs? Can the vampires trust the humans not to leave them open to a sunlight BBQ while they sleep? Mistrust abounds within the ranks, but there are a few human/vamps who are loyal to each other and the cause for which they fight.The characters of Rotter World were very well written. For as many main characters as there were, the author did a very good job giving each their own personality and making them fairly easy to keep straight. Not only were the misfit group fighting for their lives, but that many were fighting for their humanity and for the relationships they had formed over their time together. This attempt at maintaining some semblance of normalcy aided in giving the tale and it's characters believability. The uneasy alliance between the vampires and the humans, as they make their way to retrieve a vaccine that will give an immunity to the zombie virus, gives the reader a wonderful feeling of tension as questions arise as to who will be honorable in their union and who will not. Rotter Worldis action packed with some fantastic scenes of violence and gore. There are a few scenes where this reader was on the edge of her seat as the battle unfolded.Rotter World is book one of, I believe, a trilogy and one thing I really liked was that it ended...there was no HUGE cliffhanger to leave you ticked off and irritated that you have to wait for the sequel. Yes, there is more that can be told to the story and I am curious as to how certain things will play out in the next book, but Rotter World still had a fairly solid ending, which I personally enjoy.A unique and welcome mix of zombies, vampires, humans and their fight for survival Rotter World is a definite recommend from Doubleshot Reviews."}, {"userName": "Gareth Wood", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9090087-gareth-wood", "userReview": "A graphic and violent zombie book, yet quite well developed and highly enjoyable. There was far more violence and graphic imagery in this book than I am used to, but it didn't seem out of place here at all. The book centers around a community of survivors of a global outbreak that turns its victims into zombie-like creatures. The contagion that started it all was released by vampires. You can get all that from the back cover, but from here on in I'll talk about things in the book that might be considered spoilers.SPOILER ALERTInteresting that vampires released the virus that killed and reanimated so many, and that they themselves are not immune to it. In fact killing a vampire with the virus creates a sort of super-vampire-zombie that is absolutely terrifying. The author continues to ramp up the terror throughout the book as the characters advance from one plot point to the next. Having vampires as well as normal human survivors in the mix keeps the tension among them high, and Scott Baker does a really good job on the dialogue. Many of the characters are quite well fleshed out, some more-so than others, but there are a LOT of characters in the story, and always something interesting going on.The sex scenes were a surprise. I didn't expect that level of detail, but at the same time, given the attention to detail the author put into the evisceration and carnage the zombies got up to, I really should have expected it.At times I found myself wondering what might come next, as the author wrapped this one up in a place that wasn't a cliffhanger, but did leave a lot of room to explore. I look forward to his next offering."}, {"userName": "TG KMT | QUESTL\u2765VE", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8020367-tg-kmt-questl-ve", "userReview": "Surprisingly good =)The characters were great - Vampires & Humans, lots of action, apocalyptic-romance - which i absolutely LOVE - and a solid storyline.

But they soon discover why they\u2019ve been asked to take such a risk when they conduct the rescue and recover a doctor who claims to have created a vaccination for the undead virus. This virus was created by the government but was never intended to be used as a weapon\u2026at least not until vampires stole it and unleashed it upon the human world with the hopes of preventing the living from wiping them out for good. Among these survivors is a small band of vampires who have made a truce with the humans. Their race did unleashed the virus, not realizing that the zombies created with the plague would crave vampire flesh as much as human and proceed to find root out the vamps when they were at their most vulnerable-during daylight hours while they sleep. Now the few that remain must work side by side with those they once considered to be cattle to avoid going extinct.The rescued doctor proposes a mission for the survivors. He needs to get to his government lab in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania to retrieve his research and craft the initial doses of the vaccine. They survivors will serve as his escort through rotter infested lands. They agree but insist that most of the vamps go along with them despite the fact that the doctor, along with his military escort, despise the vampire race and would like nothing more than to see them all wiped out for the curse they unleashed on humanity. Rotter World starts out at a slow pace, with plenty of flashbacks to get the reader up to speed with most of the characters, then picks up speed as the mission to Gettysburg gets underway. The action is intense and the gore graphic enough to satisfy most zompoc fans. The conflicts between the humans and vamps are interesting, but I wished they had been explored in great depth. The vamps in this story are, for lack of a better word, honorable. They avoid causing conflicts with the humans and tend to avoid getting near anyone who don\u2019t trust them or even hates them. It would have been interesting to see more of the dark side of the blood suckers, even though there is plenty of human drama to deal with in this tale. As is the case with most quality zombie tales, the flesh eaters are a nightmarish menace but they are nothing compared to the few devious humans who tend to cause far more trouble than the undead ever could for the rest of the survivors. I enjoyed this story, especially toward the end when things got quite intense and the danger everyone was facing felt tangible and made my heart race. The author offers up a creative new twist on the traditional zombie tale with the introduction of another undead race. Plenty of the human and vampire characters were well developed and gave me someone to root for (and to root against). The story can certainly stand on its own though I suspect the author will be crafting a sequel, which won\u2019t elicit any complaints from me-I\u2019m looking forward to finding out what happens next with those who made it through to the last page of Rotter World."}, {"userName": "KyBunnies", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4782771-kybunnies", "userReview": "This is the last very late stoop on Scott\u2019s blog tour. Yes, I am very behind, but I have a great excuse. I blame it all on Scott and his bunnies. See, Scott is working with IO Tours. He found me through them because I am one of their blog hosts. He asks the owner Vickie to contact me asking if I would review his book because I have bunnies and he has bunnies. Well, if you are a bunny person then you help out other bunny people. I will admit I did not want to read this book because I am not a big fan of vampire books, but (yes there is always a but) the bunnies and I really did enjoy reading this. Well maybe I enjoyed reading it more than they did. Because when reading the bunnies snuggle up next to me for pets but sometimes they get bored and start nibbling on stuff. If this was a paperback book and not digital then the book would have been half chewed up before I finished. Since I have gotten a digital reader the bunnies do not like it as much but they still try to chew on it. There are little teeth marks everywhere on it lol. Okay enough about Scott, the bunnies and me. Sorry I could go on for days about bunnies.Review:Oh my this book is not just about vampires. Is full of zombies. No I did not know this when I said I would read this book. Granted this is not my normal reading. However, I try to always read a book every couple of months. I do this to just to keep myself from staying in my little square box. If we read and think outside the box then we keep our mind open to everything that is possible. This book starts out with a crew that is on a rescue mission. Yes, there are still humans that have not been infected with the virus. The strange part a small band of vampires and humans work together. Yes, a vampire released the virus that started everything, but remember that just like real life there is always good and bed people everywhere. Okay, if you have read any of the Resident Evil books or watched the movies you will love this book. The only thing different is that (Scott or his bunnies I still have not figured out which one wrote the book) this book have lots more details. If you love the blood and guts then this is the book for you. Early in the book, readers will meet the man responsible for releasing the virus. Many people do not like him. He convinces other in a stronghold that they need to travel 500 miles south to obtain the vaccine to the virus he released. Okay maybe it is me but this idiot released the vaccine, left it in some underground lab and wants others to go and get this. I know the author wrote the character this way for a reason. However early on in the book, I did not like this character and the more I read the more I disliked the Compton character.I hope no one came looking for a thorough review of this book. If you did, I apologize. I cannot write reviews that way. If I did, the review would be full of spoilers. Then it would not be worth reading and author would not work with me or ask me to review their book. I enjoyed this book even though it is not my normal reading. With everything being said the bunnies keep telling me to shut and just rate the book.The bunnies and I give this book 5 carrots.Thanks for a great read Scott."}, {"userName": "Mary Loesch", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4947755-mary-loesch", "userReview": "Rotter World\u2026the title already conjures some strong images. The book contains some even stronger ones. Of course, that's to be expected in a tale about zombies, vampires, and the military. Now before you go thinking that this is another 28 Days, Resident Evil, or Walking Dead rip off, let me just set you straight. Sure, it has some of the same qualities, but I found that this book by Scott M. Baker managed to take on a life of its own and be a really interesting, if graphic, story about mankind's survival after a zombie apocalypse. So let's get to it! Here is the synopsis from the book:Eight months ago vampires released the Revenant Virus on humanity. Both species were nearly wiped out. For Mike Robson, the situation could be far worse. He joined up with a small band of humans and the last coven of vampires who are riding out the zombie apocalypse in an old fort along the coast of southern Maine. The group's uneasy alliance is strained by the arrival of the creator of the Revenant Virus. He claims there is a vaccine that will make them immune to the virus, but it's located in a secure underground facility five hundred miles away.To retrieve the vaccine, Robson leads a raiding party of humans and vampires down the devastated East Coast. Yet none of the horrors Robson has faced match what awaits in the underground facility.Yeah, I'm gonna agree. What waited in the facility was pretty bad and one of the reasons I love the cover of this book. It captures a moment that was riveting in the novel!I think Mr. Baker did a great job of creating sympathetic characters that have gone through a lot. Robson, the protagonist, is especially well done. He's the everyman who's been beaten down my guilt over an incident that was really beyond his control. The camp relies on him, as does, Natalie who falls for him. Their relationship is sweet to watch and I found myself worried about what would happen to them in the end. By the way, Mr. Baker, great sex scene!I like the vampire element in this book, too. The vamps are the bad guys who realize they've made a big mistake in releasing the zombie virus. It practically wipes out their entire race and causes them to join forces with the humans. Of course, not everyone is on board with this kind of alliance which just adds tension to the plot. O'Bannon is an awesome bad guy, and as a reader, you can't help but root for the zombies and hope they get him in the end.My only complaint is that I wanted more. I got plenty, but I wanted to know what happened next. Did they get back to camp? Did everyone get vaccinated? Sequel, please!If you can't tell, I highly recommend Rotter World by Scott M. Baker. Keep in mind it does contain some graphic violence and is not for the faint of heart! Pregnant women should consider reading it only if they want to give birth early. People with heart problems should probably take their pills first."}, {"userName": "Jess(ToTheMoonAndBackReviews)", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5821254-jess-tothemoonandbackreviews", "userReview": "This has been a great month to read zombie stories, normally I am a huge coward, not the girliest of girls whenever I find myself watching zombie flicks or even reading them, I jump at the tiniest of noise and hide behind my hands as I wait for it to be over.This book deffinetly didn't skimp on the gore or grime as you go from one story to the next, following their path from multiple poins of view.This book deffinetly had a Resident Evil feel to me. It was as if they decided to follow someone else instead of the main charachter's and while they traveled in search of the cure for the virus that had turned people into the flesh eating zombie's that had over run the earth, you get the vampires thrown into the mix.That was one of the best thing's about it, you have a mix of all three big bad monster's in the world, and yes I classify the humans as a monster mainly because of the way humanity seems to have slid downards on the moral scale. There was deffinetly a varity of emotion when it came to the vampires, you had an equal number of people for them being a part of the camp and team and other's ready to destroy them, rather for their own reason's or because of a fanatic belief. I also loved the fact that the humans were not the only one's facing extincton, that the vampires also found themselves falling prey to the disease. If you are in the mood for some kick butt action scene's full of gore and blood as bodies are ripped apart and zombies are plowed through, and somehow people manage to find a way to fall in love, then this book is for you."}, {"userName": "Trisha", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6092991-trisha", "userReview": "The only thing I don't like about zombie books is that they end when I want them to keep going. Maybe that's why I like The Walking Dead tv show so much- there's always more to the story coming up at some point. Anyway, I felt this book ended on a strong note- so much so that I didn't want it to end where it did. The story did drag a bit about half way through the book, but not enough for me to put it down. It gave me what I was looking for in a zombie apocolypse book- action, suspense, and plenty of gore. Sometimes I'm just in the mood for such a book, and this one did not disappoint. There were characters that I rooted for (Oh please don't eat that person!) and there were characters I disliked (Oh please, zombie, will you just eat that person already!). I did like the vampire twist- they do exist, and they were the ones who unleashed the zombie virus upon the world- even though I was skeptical at first. Karma definitely has it's day in Rotter World, especially at the book's conclusion. Don't read this if you are squeamish about descriptions of bodies being torn apart and consumed in the worst possible way. Although if you are squeamish about such things I suppose you wouldn't be reading it in the first place.

I won't be reading on with this series."}, {"userName": "Sydney", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4870438-sydney", "userReview": "First of all, I'd like to announce that I received this book on a giveaway. With that said, I can honestly say that it does not effect my option. Starting out reading my first zombie book I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to get into the mind set of the world over run by the living dead. The book gives you the back story through many flashbacks as well as told from the characters. Although the on the cover it warns of being graphic, the only thing that I found slightly graphic were the few sexual scenes. Over all I thought the novel was good even if I didn't particularly care for the ending. If you want a good zombie book, pick this one up and start reading!"}, {"userName": "Shinez", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13077460-shinez", "userReview": "Great story line, especially enjoyed the vampire twist which is a first in a zombie book so far for me. Very graphic and suspense filled, was sorry it ended so soon.Part of me was hoping that the vampires would try to save the non zombie victims by turning them before they died as a way to increase their numbers and save those who were worth saving.. Maybe in the next book?!!?"}, {"userName": "Stewie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2723597-stewie", "userReview": "An action packed, brisk read that puts a nice spin on a genre going stale.

For Mike Robson, the situation could be far worse. He has joined up with a small band of humans and the last coven of vampires who are riding out the zombie apocalypse in an old fort along the coast of southern Maine. The uneasy alliance between humans and vampires is strained with the arrival of the creator of the Revenant Virus. Compton claims to have a vaccine that will make them immune from the virus and allow mankind to take civilization back from the living dead. However, the vaccine is located in a secure underground facility five hundred miles away. To retrieve the vaccine, Robson leads a raiding party of humans and vampires down the East Coast, which has been devastated by the outbreak and overrun by zombies and rape gangs. Yet none of the horrors he deals with on the road can prepare him for what he will find in Pennsylvania. Once inside the underground facility, the Robson encounters the greatest threat his group has faced to date, not only from zombies but from betrayal within their own ranks.", "title": "Rotter World\n      \n          (Rotter Trilogy #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576244-rotter-world", "average": 3.94, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1333476063l/13576244.jpg", "reviews": 20, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3505916.Scott_M_Baker", "name": "Scott M.
