I felt the cold, the hunger as the settlers face one of the coldest winters ever, and the fear as things are happening that are not easily understood. It is easy to fall back on superstitions, cries of witchcraft and a return to the old ways. The Swedish Lapland, not an easy place to live, hearty, hardworking people, tasked with survival and dictated to by their church. Even here, politics are at play and things happen that cannot have a rational explanation. Evil is said to rule this mountain area and though the Laplanders are said to have converted to Christianity, the settlers are still very distrustful and suspicious of this group of hardy nomads.Maija and her family come here and become involved in a situation seemingly without explanation. Her and her two daughters will suffer greatly and her daughter Fredricka will form an alliance that some will call unholy, a lasting legacy.A wonderful winter read, and I loved reading about the culture and traditions of these group of early settlers to Lapland. The churches influence and the political struggle. But, ultimately the story is about Maija and daughters, the old ways and the suspicions of those ways. Wonderfully written, with some very interesting characters. A first book from an author I expect big things from.ARC from Netgalley."}, {"userName": "Jeanette", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette", "userReview": "Although I am stingy with 5 star ratings, this one cannot be diminished to a 4. It's slow. You'll require patience. And you will need to be within 1717 and the bleakest period of Swedish small holdings and peasant existence. And never forget that I warned you that the read will not be fun. It occurs within what was known then as \"Lapland\" in general but on one dark mountain in Sweden, in particular. Lapland encompassed Sweden, Finland, Norway and parts of Russia. Peoples who are now called Sami (as ethnic designation) are then called \"Lapps\". The Lapps are nomadic and enter our homestead territory in Winter. The homestead or towns population are in great majority from Scandinavian ancestry.There are no revisionist sensibilities in this novel. Nothing but 1717 eyes or concepts. There is no energy wasted on shedding tears. Often within a starving horror that views a frost in late June. Or with Plague returned. And Sweden has been at war for 150 years. The complexities of Lutheran Christianity and earlier Viking types of animism/polytheism/shamanism are sometimes clashing and at other times fermenting to accusations in common to reactions from surviving great evil. Evil not only perceived, but that is revealed with full eyed evidence. This is not an easy book to read. Beyond the depth and complexity it also encompasses entry into spirit and psychic territories. Yet beyond that there is also politico in which authority keeps coming from multiple directions which are all beyond knowing. Or often disguised as a needed neighbor or workmate, known for years of their loving trust. Mothers and daughters, Great-Grandmother long gone but never closer- it is their tales, as well. It is also a tale of tremendous physical suffering and endurance.Those who cry easily when reading may want to pass this book by. This is a world where humans live and do what they need to live. Sometimes those ways don't parse with central heating sensitivities. It's a world where childhood as we conceive of that period in life, much of that definition's nuance does not exist. The first half of the book will little reveal to you the lyrical and sublime meshing within the last 2 parts. As Frederika's skills expand, so does the poetic sting. Soldiering, \"hearts and souls\" of loyalty or trust, class system intrigue, marriage mistrust- they are all there too. Not since Wolf Hall or Bring Up the Bodies have I read such a skilled look into a period of change. But this one surpasses those, because it holds no king or highest agent at its central point- but only the cognition of those servile individuals who hold those \"hearts and souls\" ultimate definitions within their own particular minds and spirits.This is not a feel good book. It's a book you may remember after 30 other reads. Now, I must go and shovel snow. About 12 more inches but I can easily open the door. So simple compared to winter lodging with Maija and her girls! I do NOT recommend this book to you as a murder mystery buff or one who likes action. This is much closer to a think piece. And how evil truly lurks and is in increments exposed."}, {"userName": "Amalia Gavea", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56789747-amalia-gavea", "userReview": "When I think of Lappland images of tipis, the mystical, ethereal lights of Aurora Borealis, a landscape covered with snow, a sky painted with all gradients of pink and purple, clothes in vivid hues of blue and red come to my mind. A place where the tales come alive to mingle with the lives of its people. This is Wolf Winter. A tale that is beautiful in its darkness and haunting in its bleakness. Folktales of witchcraft and ghosts emerge with everyday life becoming the blanket upon which one can forge plans of revenge and redemption. At the heart of the story we find Maija - one of the most fascinating characters in recent literature - her eldest daughter Federika, and the Priest who has more secrets than any. Cecilia Ekb\u00e4ck's protagonists are fleshed out and her beautiful prose leads us into an unforgettable reading experience. Although each character is interesting and extremely well - written, I admit I have a soft spot for our Priest whose name becomes known towards the end of the novel. I don't consider myself a slow reader, but I deliberately read this novel as slowly as I could to savour each page. This is one of the rare cases where I hope for a novel to become a film. A dark, beautiful masterpiece in the hands of a Scandinavian director. Somehow, while I was reading, I kept picturing Finland's Peter Franz\u00e9n as the Priest. Such novels are hard to find these days. Do yourself a favour and dive right into it.

Very similar in many ways to Burial Rites which is up there in my most favourite books.Wolf Winter is not quite that good but it is still intriguing and very readable. I was occasionally annoyed by the main character's neglect of her own children in her pursuit of justice, but then no one in this story was perfect. The ending is ambiguous which I believe was the intention of the author. As a glass half full person I am sure they all lived happily ever after.

I think what I loved most about this book is the author's descriptions of nature and weather . Her anthropomorphism's of these elements helps to create a dark, eerie and suspenseful setting. The characters were all complex and memorable. I enjoyed all the twists and turns, and could never figure out who killed Eriksson. The magical realism was well done and formed a natural part of the story. What will stay with me for a long time is the difficulty of just surviving in this incredibly harsh environment.

Multiple characters share point-of-view time, but it is Maija and her elder daughter Frederika whose grip on the story's reins steers the narrative. Maija and her family have only just arrived from Finland to take over a dead relative's homestead when Frederika comes across the body of local man. It's presumed he was slain by a pack of wolves, but the nature of wounds would suggest otherwise.Ekb\u00e4ck pairs a murder mystery with finely-crafted historical fiction. Set in Swedish Lapland in 1717, Wolf Winter immerses the reader in an isolated collection of homesteads clinging to Black\u00e4sen Mountain, as well as the politics of a monarchy on the edge of collapse. She shows us the power granted to clergy in holding together communities strung out over vast terrain and the power of legend in feeding suspicion and fear. Wolf Winter joins other northern latitude noir literary fiction, such as Stef Penny's The Tenderness of Wolves (more wolves!), Eowyn Ivey's The Snow Child, David Vann's Caribou Island and Hannah Kent's Burial Rites, where frozen landscapes exact a dark tone, a ponderous pace, an otherworldly struggle for survival against elements both natural and abnormal. The author set herself an enormous challenge for her debut: a blend of genres that relies on tight control of pacing, yet demands a rich tapestry of detail and exposition. There is a certain superfluity to some village scenes, a need to make certain the reader understands the distant political wranglings, but these are mild complaints set against a deliciously shivery tale rendered in gorgeous, pitch-perfect prose. After this impressive debut, I can't wait to see what she does next."}, {"userName": "RitaSkeeter", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21914765-ritaskeeter", "userReview": "'Wolf winter' is now also used to describe the darkest of times in a human being's life - the kind of period that imprints on you that you are mortal and, at the end of the day, always alone.  Atmospheric, chilling, eerie. So many words that could be used to describe this book; but words that are ultimately inept at capturing this book. Two books that were top reads for me in 2014 were The Snow Child and Burial Rites. This book was like a combination of the two. The frigid dark of  Burial Rites , but with the magic realism of  The Snow Child . It wasn't, therefore, a surprise to read in the author's notes at the end that the author is a fan of Hannah Kent and Eowyn Ivey. This book also reminds me a little of The Miniaturist. They are nothing alike in plot, setting, or anything else really. The similarity for me is that blend of historical fiction with magic realism. As with  The Miniaturist  this book will appeal to some and not others.What I loved, was the author's ability to so deftly build a picture of time and place, with  no  info dumping. We all know how much I hate info dumping in historical fiction. Do I have a full and complete understanding of Lappland at this time. No. But the book serves as an introduction, and introduced me to a lot of information I hadn't previously been aware of.  And  the book did it in a way that was entertaining. That's a win for me.This book really impressed me. The imagery, the savage brutality that made me wince, the barren and stark landscape, and the people struggling to survive in it. I borrowed this from the library, but I'm going to get my own copy  plus  I've pre-ordered the author's next book already.

Told with three different narratives, Maaja, the mother of the finnish family, Frederika, her teenage daughter and the priest. A body is found, a murder has happened and the story essentially revolves around how and why intertwined with politics, religion, superstitions and fear. It's goes along at a slow pace and normally I would struggle with that but here it's pitched perfect. It's not a book to be devoured but a book where every word should be read and savoured. Reading only 20 - 30 pages a night I felt I was reading at the pace of the book which made it all the more enjoyable. This is very much character driven with the three voices, all engrossing characters with redeeming qualities. Frederika was the one I most felt for, Maaja, I admired her tenacity and drive to push through and the priest calling into question his faith and what is right. It all just drifted along seamlessly like the snow, creating shivers and causing much burrowing under the duvet as that hard winter hit.I'm surprised myself but there was really nothing I didn't like, from the characterisation to the descriptiveness to the supernatural elements. Not once did I skim paragraphs or speed read a page. And no one is more surprised than I. Even though I knew I wanted to read the book, I was wary of the supernatural/ghostly elements. Not usually my thing, but I needn't have worried.Wolf Winter is an evocative, atmospheric, haunting insight into how life was in 1717 Lapland, written in a beautiful and poetic way that had me totally under its spell.

Started out as a murder mystery set in 1717 Swedish Lapland. Among a small group of homesteaders, an unpleasant man is murdered. Enter Maija and her family emigrating from Finland; she and an uncle have exchanged properties. Besides the death, there are a mysterious forest fire, disappearance of several folks, including children. The people interact with the local Sami [Lapps]. A mountain seems to exert some kind of sinister pull on the people. Supernatural incidences pile up as the novel progresses, becoming more chilling. Both Maija and daughter Frederika try to solve the mystery. After an unexplained appearance, the girl is gradually drawn into the shamanistic belief system of the Sami. Ostensibly Christian, they still cling to some of their old folkways. Maija, her family, and the whole settlement fight the cruelest winter in living memory upon them. There are red herrings aplenty and twists and turns. When you think you have the story figured out, the author throws something completely unexpected your way. Secrets abound and things are not always what they seem at first glance. The writing was absolutely gorgeous; I was amazed how the author could project such a dark, mysterious atmosphere full of foreboding and sense of dread; I felt the bleakness of the landscape reflecting the bleakness of the characters was especially well done. I really liked her writing of Maija's coping with the harsh winter and also, the final coming of Spring. \n\"On the river and lake the snow begins to open.

The only thing that matters in this place is surviving, survival of the fittest.I was most interested in Frederika, the daughter of Maija. She had a very strange way about her. I could not entirely make her out. From a modern day perspective, she would seem to be mentally unwell.

It's not an easy read and you may not warm to the characters who are strong but flawed. It is a slow read that takes some time to develop and unwrap and those who favour fast paced thrillers may find that it is not to their taste. However, it is a powerful and skillfully told story with some beautiful prose. The author notes that the early 18th century was a time of great change in Sweden, which had been at war for the last 150 years at great cost to its people. Taxes were high, villages were depleted of men for farming, and on top of that there were several years of crop failure as well as the plague. The economy was collapsing, the people starving and the nobility were begging the king to seek peace.It is into this political background that Paavo and Maija and their daughters Dorotea aged six and Federika, fourteen, arrive from Finland in summer to farm their Uncle's property on the side of Blackasen Mountain. There are six homesteads on the side of the mountain all existing in a hand to mouth existence where they must grow and hunt enough food over the short summer to store away for the cold, dark days of winter if they want to survive. Life is hard and the landscape harsh and unforgiving. Despite being so far from the rest of civilization the settlers are still ruled by the church. A day's walk away is an abandoned town complete with church and a priest who presides over the settlers and serves out harsh justice and penance for those who do wrong in the eyes of the law or the church. In early winter the church will call the people from the mountains around the town to come and reside in the abandoned houses to attend sermons. The Lapps, who have converted from Shamanism to Christianity, also come in with their reindeer herds to make their winter camp and trade with the settlers. Not long after arriving on Blackasen, Dorotea and Federika discover a man's body lying on the mountain. He is an unpleasant man who nobody likes and at first it is thought that he was killed by a bear but Maija has seen the wounds and knows no animal was involved. Maija and the priest are determined to seek out the truth but there has been a long history of betrayals and disappearances on the mountain. The settlers do not trust Maija and are suspicious of her motives. Everyone has secrets they want to keep hidden and the facts are uncovered slowly, layer by layer. Federika is also driven to solve the mystery. She is haunted by visions of the dead man and is drawn to the Lapps and their spiritual relationship with the land and the mountain. She knows that the mountain will not be appeased until the evil done on it has been revealed and the guilty punished.The winter of 1717 was especially long and hard, a 'wolf winter', a winter to end all winters. Paavo leaves for the coast to find employment leaving Maija alone to survive the winter alone with her daughters. Their struggle to survive the snowstorms and the starvation is almost too much for them and you can almost feel the cold and the hunger seeping out of the pages.The truth when it comes is shocking, lives are altered forever and no one escapes unscathed. However, daylight has appeared again and spring is on it's way bringing hope back to the settlers:\"Underneath the snow, on the ground, there are things, things long thought dead: flowers in knots, whole branches held in tight buds.

What an introduction! My blood was coursing through my veins at a dizzying rate!Wolf Winter is historical fiction in that it depicts fictional characters in fictional situations, but in the context of a real historical period. The story begins in June of 1717 when Paavo, Maija, and their two daughters swap homesteads with Paavo\u2019s uncle and move inland from Finland to Sweden because Paavo suffers from \u201cterrors\u201d and can no longer fish at sea. What the author reveals of the history is sketchy, general background information about Swedish politics, of Sweden being constantly at war, about conflicts between the monarchy and nobility, and the difficulties encountered by the common folk and the Laplanders. We do get a sense of the church combating superstitions, sorcery, witchcraft, and belief in spirits, except God and devil, of course. Punishments for sin are severe and very public. The author researched this period extensively, but rather making me feel like I was reading a period piece, Ekback immersed me in her prose. I should also point out that she drew from her Lapp heritage in spinning this marvelous mystery, which was quite mystical at times.Wolf winter, according to Ms. Ekback, is a term used by Swedes to refer to a long, bitterly harsh winter, especially \u201cback in the day\u201d when there was starvation. But, she says, it also refers to a personal experience in one\u2019s life that is extremely difficult, e.g., the loss of a loved one, a serious illness, something that reminds one of one\u2019s own mortality and sense of aloneness. (http://www.powells.com/blog/interview....) Her book certainly contains all of that. I grew up in some awfully cold, snowy winters in northern Minnesota. But the settlers in the 1700s did not have any modern conveniences to keep them safe, warm, well fed, and connected with their neighbors. As I read about the storm raging, I huddled against the iciness in my bones. I covered my ears against the howling of the wind. I strained my eyes to pierce the darkness. We learn of the death of the man, Eriksson, and the quest for answers from the perspectives of Maija, Frederika, and the priest Olaus. Maija is a strong, driven woman who simply must learn the truth. At times, she seems quick to judge; at others, she is open and accepting. Frederika, who is no longer a young girl but not yet a woman, is slowly finding her gifts. I found her to be a fascinating person. The priest, whose name is seldom used, was someone I had a hard time liking, although when I learned his story, I did like him in the end. My other favorite character was little Dorotea, who seems so sweet and innocent, yet so brave. The pace and the tension are varied. At times, as daily tasks are described, it is slow and steady. Then it quickens as danger approaches. The mood is often eerie and foreboding. Sometimes the cause is natural; the environment is severe and unforgiving. Sometimes it is man-made; the settlers are Christian, yet they are fearful and superstitious. The Lapps have their own customs and beliefs. And again, sometimes the apprehension is supernatural. Ms. Ekback blends many voices in the minds and hearts of her characters, especially Maija, Frederika, and Fearless, the Lapp spiritual leader. The presence of ghosts is confusing at times, especially when Maija\u2019s late grandmother Jutta suddenly converses with her or with Frederika. As Frederika becomes wrapped up in her own investigation into Eriksson\u2019s death, along with the day-to-day struggle for survival, the story takes on a life of its own.For the most part, I loved Ekback\u2019s prose. She illustrates the stoicism of the Scandinavian people, their work ethic, and their simplicity. Even with phrases such as, \u201c\u201chis heart scurried into his throat,\u201d (page 228) she captured my imagination. The author\u2019s first language is Swedish, so writing this book in English was a challenge for her. There were a few sentences that just didn\u2019t make sense to me, but overall, I found myself drawn in by the magic wilderness and the mountain. Oh, that mountain! It\u2019s a fictional place, thank goodness. It is the symbol of evil, of hardship, of darkness. The wolves, too, bring panic and death. Are they real or imagined? There are themes of fear, prejudice, mistrust, trust, loyalty, hard work, love, and spirituality. No one is what he or she appears to be on the surface. All of this makes for a chilling, almost magical tale that had me guessing and then guessing some more.4-1/2 stars"}, {"userName": "Claire McAlpine", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2528841-claire-mcalpine", "userReview": "Set in Swedish Lappland in 1717, Cecilia Ekb\u00e4ck\u2019s debut novel Wolf Winter follows a family of four, Maija, her husband Paavo and their daughters Frederika and Dorotea from a fishing village in their native Finland to the forested lands surrounding Sweden\u2019s Black\u00e5sen mountain.They swap houses with Maija\u2019s brother, deciding a life in the interior may be better suited to Paavo, who had developed numerous fears keeping him from earning his living at sea. However, when their daughters stumble across a dead body allegedly killed by wolves, on a route near the mountain, they begin to wonder whether they have left one dark dream for an even blacker nightmare.Maiji suspects it was a crime and makes it her business to ask questions to an extremely reticent and unappreciative band of local settlers and itinerant Lapps. Her husband never questions her interference, even when present he plays no role and as soon as the first signs herald the approach of winter, he sets off alone for the coast, leaving the women-folk to survive the harsh physical elements and the even stranger mystical apparitions that some but not all will witness. Without a man to steer them out of trouble, the woman face many risks, not least being perceived as dabbling in witchcraft, as church records show has happened to a few others with similar inclinations who preceded them.Unfortunately, I couldn't really get into this novel in the way I wanted to, though it wasn't a difficult read. It didn't portray a sense of the era, it felt contemporary even though it did evoke a strong sense of place and it was clear there were no modern comforts. Perhaps it was the attitude and freedom of the protagonist that didn't sit with the era.The time spent with a number of the characters was so fleeting, it left too little of an impact and rendered them insufficient to develop an interest in. The storyline itself raised so many questions that went unanswered, like why did the husband go off and leave his family in such a vulnerable position when they could have gone with him and been protected. And why did the wife think she as a newcomer could become an investigator into a crime that clearly the locals were not happy about being questioned, especially when it threatened her safety. Her role was to assist in bringing new life (she was a kind of midwife) and yet at every turn she was endangering those close to her. The younger daughter nearly lost her feet to frostbite after trekking in a blizzard to ask the Lapps questions about the murder. I didn't believe in Maiji\u2019s intentions and relationships and the blurred line between reality and the mystical elements. I wanted to be drawn in by it, but was unable to brush off the scepticism.So what drew me towards reading this novel in the first place?Well the snowy winter setting was very appealing, the plot sounded intriguing and the praise of Hilary Mantel and the Library Journal, who had this to say definitely lured me in:\u201cThe novel will appeal to readers who like their historical fiction dark and atmospheric, or mystery fans who are open to mysticism and unconventional sleuths. Readers who enjoyed the winter landscape and magical realism of Eowyn Ivey\u2019s The Snow Child may also want to try this.\u201d Library Journal\u201cThe story creeps up and possesses the imagination; there\u2019s something eerie in the way half-understood and only half-seen events leave their mark. It\u2019s a powerful feat of suggestion, visually acute, skillfully written; it won\u2019t easily erase its tracks in the reader\u2019s mind.\u201d Hilary MantelIt was an interesting concept and disappointing that it wasn't more engaging, but for those who like a good mystery with an element of hinted at magical realism, this could be just what Hilary Mantel suggests it is."}, {"userName": "Majo", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30569725-majo", "userReview": "Los puntos m\u00e1s fuertes de este libro son la ambientaci\u00f3n y el terror creciente a medida que la trama va a avanzando.

It is set in 18th century northern Sweden, Lappland. The crown is sending peasants from the south to move into Lapp (now called Sami) territory in what are familiar patterns of colonialism. The nomadic Lapps herded reindeer and followed an animist religion. Their Christianization and eroding of their territory were central to the Crown's vision. Set in a time when the king of Sweden Charles XII spent most of his lifetime out of the country waging war for Swedish control of the Baltic. The Swedish people were burdened with crippling taxes, and most of the men forced into the army.The heroine Maija, her husband Paava, and two daughters move from Finland to Swedish to occupy a homestead Paava's uncle has abandoned. The homestead is in the shadow of a mountain that is believed to hold an evil power over the area. The locals and the priest see it as the place the devil lives. There is a murder which Maija is the first to decry as that. As winter approaches, and the family is low on money, Paava returns to the coast to work leaving his family alone in the wilderness outside to the settlement where a few families live.The book tells the story of the struggles against multiple evils, some among the locals, of the Lapp people to keep on, and Maija and her daughters to survive a brutal winter. Maija is descended from women with powers that Christianity rejects but the Lapps recognize. Her daughter Frederika has inherited these powers, and comes to recognize and cultivate them. The story maintains a balance between the realities of a brutal winter, life under a sometimes brutal king, and suggestions of other powers without slipping into the realm of fantasy. Instead the reader feels this was the worldview of Swedes and Lapps of the time. The story is threaded with suspense until the very end."}, {"userName": "Issicratea", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23268828-issicratea", "userReview": "Cecilia Ekb\u00e4ck\u2019s novel is worth the admission price for the title metaphor alone. According to the afterword, the expression \u201cWolf Winter\u201d\u2014in Swedish Vargawinter\u2014refers to an unusually bitter and long winter, but it is also used to describe the darkest of times in a human being\u2019s life\u2014the kind of time that imprints on you that you are mortal, and, at the end of the day, always alone. That's a remarkable charge of meaning for a single word.Actually, Wolf Winter has a fair amount to recommend it besides the title, especially for a first novel. The writing is excellent\u2014as spare and bleak and chill as you might hope for in a novel set in eighteenth-century Swedish Lapland. Ekb\u00e4ck conjures this remote world with great vividness. The narrative plays out mainly in the cruel, wolf-haunted, mountainous terrain of Black\u00e5sen, where a motley assortment of settlers eke out a desperately poor living in their far-flung homesteads. The other main settings are a desolate town, near-deserted all year round apart from Church festivals, and a Lapp\u2014or Sami\u2014camp, scene of a single disturbing episode. The tense relationship between the Swedish and Finnish settlers and the native Sami is one of the running themes of the novel, as is the tension between Christian belief and a more ancient, spirit-rich, pantheistic sensibility.Ekb\u00e4ck uses a murder mystery format to structure the narrative, and the novel bowls along happily in that vein for quite a while, piling suspicion upon suspicion and clue upon clue. I was gripped for about the first two thirds of it, but after that point, the narrative began to unravel. There are too many twists and revelations and dark secrets unveiled in close succession, as if Ekb\u00e4ck couldn\u2019t decide among a number of potential endings and decided to throw them all into the mix. The magic-realist element, delicately etched in at first, is laid on with a trowel towards the end of the novel. Ekb\u00e4ck\u2019s attempts to integrate her fictional narrative with the political history of the period are rather strained and flimsy, as well.Still, I don't want to be too negative about this novel. Its was an absorbing read for the most part, its narrative glitches redeemed by the quality of the writing. I\u2019ll be intrigued to see how Ekb\u00e4ck\u2019s writing develops from here."}, {"userName": "Wanda", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda", "userReview": "This book came to my attention when I heard the author interviewed on local radio\u2014she is Scandinavian, but she now lives in Calgary with her family. What I heard in the interview intrigued me and I waited quite a long time to receive the book from our public library. Wolf Winter is basically a medieval murder mystery set in 16th century Sweden. Should you read this book? Well, if you like historical fiction, murder mysteries, and Scandinavian fiction, all with a touch of the supernatural, this will be your book. The author is extremely good at producing an aura of creeping dread (to go with the usual rather bleak and somewhat gloomy haze that permeates most of Scandinavian fiction). The reader is left to decide for themselves whether the supernatural elements really happen or if the circumstances are all the result of damaged people (somewhat reminiscent of The Turn of the Screw, I felt). None of the characters is overwhelmingly good\u2014they all have their own baggage and problems that they are dealing with, some more complicated than others. Correspondingly, no one is absolutely evil, although a couple of characters move closer to that line than most do.Not a book for everyone (what book is?), but very enjoyable for me."}, {"userName": "Maria Chnoic", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46346297-maria-chnoic", "userReview": "\u201cSometimes that is how the most important insights came, in drips and drops, You took a step back and there is was: a waterway.\u201dYes, Wolf Winter is a little of a slow burner but it\u2019s worth it. At first I was very unimpressed with the characters and setting but steadily, steadily, as ice forms and a lake freezes over, the characters grew on me. The slow pace is in fact central to the story and is a reflection of the isolation of the characters' lives as they are stranded by weather conditions in Swedish Lapland. We have several mysteries hidden within the novel. The central and obvious mystery being the opening murder and who amongst such a small number of people can possibly be responsible. But there is also the mystery of every characters past life and let's just say a lot more happening then was immediately obvious to me as I read the story.

The atmosphere of Lapland and it\u2019s cold winter was perfect and truly freezing, but for a \u2018thriller/mystery\u2019 novel, there was just too little plot and suspense to make Wolf Winter worth reading. This story takes place in 1717 on Black\u00e5sen Mountain in the north of Sweden, Lapland. Midwife Maija and her family just moved from Finland to a house at the foot of the mountain, when her two young daughters stumbled upon the body of a dead man. The other settlers of the mountain blame a wolf, but the wounds are too clean for that. Despite the suspicion it raises, and the harsh winter to deal with, Maija sets out to investigate the death. The author is a master at painting a world of snow, ice and freezing temperatures. Everything gets under your skin: the threat of getting snowed-in, the awful effects of frostbite, and the endless days waiting for sunlight and the start of spring. You can really feel that Ekb\u00e4ck is drawing from personal experience here.Sadly, the pacing is glacial (excuse the pun) and since there isn\u2019t much of a plot, apart from the mystery of \u201cwho killed Eriksson?\u201d, the story soon becomes a drag to read. There were just too many confusing plotlines: Are those wolves real? How is Antti always suddenly there? Why are these people on a remote mountain so concerned with the Swedish King?!Halfway the book I just started skim-reading because the events didn\u2019t held my attention anymore. I also didn\u2019t connect with any of the characters, main or side. Maija is supposed to be this smart, level-headed woman, and yet she is so stupid to immediately start investigating a murder just four days after she arrived in a new place. Many times through the story people warn her \u201cStop this, you\u2019re raising distrust, you\u2019re endangering your family\u201d but she doesn\u2019t care about that. Her youngest daughter even ends up with frostbite due to her investigations; Maija is not a good mother here!Her husband is also absent for the biggest part of the story (he apparently is cursed, but that never is explained well), and neither are the paranormal powers of Maija\u2019s oldest daughter. The Priest showed the most potential, but just like the Sami people or \u2018Laplanders\u2019, he doesn't get the attention they deserve. Towards the end the murder is solved, but since I never really got to know the side-characters, I didn\u2019t care about who did it. Eriksson is an asshole anyway, so no loss there. I\u2019m surprised authors like Lee Child and Hillary Mantel gave such praise to this book, because I think it\u2019s undeserved: \"Wolf Winter\" is not as great a chilling mystery as it could have been. *= Sorry Amalia: I\u2019m very glad for your recommendation, but I just didn\u2019t love this book as much as you did.Travel TBR-2018: Sweden/Lapland"}, {"userName": "Stephanie Jane (Literary Flits)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31264299-stephanie-jane-literary-flits", "userReview": "I received a copy of Wolf Winter from the publisher via NetGalley in return for an honest review.I absolutely loved Wolf Winter! Set in Swedish Lapland in 1717, the novel tells of a tiny settler community's struggle to survive during a particularly harsh and bitter winter. Adding to their fear is the knowledge that one amongst them is a murderer. Recent Finnish immigrant, Maija, is determined to discover who was responsible for a violent murder that occurred pretty much as her family arrived, however Wolf Winter is not a standard whodunnit thriller. Instead, the story is a thoughtful and measured exploration of living in an incredibly inhospitable environment and of how, when even basic survival is not guaranteed, fear can become a significant enemy.I loved Ekback's wonderfully real descriptions of Blackasen mountain and the settler homesteads dotted around its base. Her writing allowed me to picture every aspect of the place and also to understand the eerie isolation of Maija and her children. Knowing that other people are not especially far away, but that your chances of reaching them mean they might as well be on the moon, is a terrifying prospect. Ekback never overdoes the threats to her characters so their predicaments are thoroughly believable throughout the novel, yet she continues to weave in extra strands until fear itself becomes one of their greatest challenges. Wolf Winter is not a fast moving novel. Instead its cleverly varying pace acts more like a pressure cooker and, once engrossed in the story, I found it difficult to tear myself away from the pages. A device I particularly liked was illustrating the passing of time with a series of spaced descriptive paragraphs with little or no action. The contrast then to fast-moving violent incidents was very effective.Every character is a very real person, convincing in their actions. Maija's immigrant Finn family are used to snowy winters, but their outsiders' view of Blackasen life and responses to it is expertly portrayed. The particular difficulties of women to be heard in a strongly patriarchal society is an important theme, as is that of the Church and its failure to understand the settlers lives. I had no idea that the temporary trading and taxation towns existed so was fascinated by this detail.I think Wolf Winter will appeal to readers who enjoy character driven novels and especially the creeping dread style of Nordic Noir. Perhaps parallels can be drawn with the recently successful Burial Rites by Hannah Kent, which I also thought was brilliant(!), although I think Wolf Winter is a more magically mysterious tale. A wonderful novel and I will eagerly await Ekback's next work."}, {"userName": "Tannaz", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60617904-tannaz", "userReview": "\u0628\u0647 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u062a\u0631\u0633\u0646\u0627\u06a9 \u0646\u0647 \u0628\u06af\u0648\u06cc\u06cc\u0645!\u0627\u0644\u0628\u062a\u0647 \u0646\u0645\u06cc \u062f\u0627\u0646\u0645 \u0645\u0646 \u0632\u06cc\u0627\u062f\u062a\u0631\u0633\u0648 \u0647\u0633\u062a\u0645 \u06cc\u0627 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0648\u0627\u0642\u0639\u0627 \u062a\u0631\u0633\u0646\u0627\u06a9 \u0628\u0648\u062f!"}, {"userName": "Tiffany Reisz", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4612196-tiffany-reisz", "userReview": "Fantastic thriller."}, {"userName": "Melissa Crytzer Fry", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3857699-melissa-crytzer-fry", "userReview": "**4.5/4.75 stars **This atmospheric novel drips with a sense of foreboding, but underlying that darkness is respect and admiration for the environment and the harsh Swedish winters of the mid 1700s.While I generally don\u2019t favor mysteries, I suppose, at its heart, this book is a who-done-it. And while the reader is left with a multitude of potential suspects (and lots of conjecture among the characters as to who \u2013 or what \u2013 is responsible), the novel is so much more: it\u2019s literary historical fiction with breathtaking natural descriptions; it\u2019s character-driven fiction as three point-of-view characters reveal their deep personal struggles and growth; and it also contains supernatural elements. The book questions the role of the church, of loyalty, fear \u2013 all the things that made survival for settlers at Blackasen Mountain so very trying. I am a fan of any author who can conjure nature as a character, and Ekback does this in spades. One example of the beautifully haunting landscape imagery:The snow is leaving. The mounds sink and settle, pour out and down. It\u2019s already down to its first layers: coarse and grainy, so transparent the ground is almost visible right through. The river tries to break through her lock. She groans. Down by her outflow she begins to gnaw at the lake ice. Then she pushes through with a scream\u2026.And\u2026The river scrambles its banks. The lake swallows its shores. Water gushes into the forest until the trees are knee-deep. And now the marsh too begins to bubble as she thaws.Fans of Burial Rites (which I felt was more character-driven \u2013 and was one of my favorite novels of all time) will enjoy this book, even with its mystery components. In fact, I think this book skillfully spans genres and will impress readers of both commercial fiction and literary. There are many symbolic and thematic considerations within the pages of this novel: about the weight of carrying ghosts from the past, about the weight of love, ambition, tradition, community and duty to country and church, as well as to self. It really was a lovely read with a lot of surprising twists and turns that will have me thinking for quite some time."}], "description": "There are six homesteads on Blackasen Mountain.A day's journey away lies the empty town.
