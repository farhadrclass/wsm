As far as writing style and ability, I admire Coble. Her writing style is enjoyable and well-rounded.Content... since I'm given permission for my honest review, that is what I'll stick with. I know other readers who enjoy suspense may like this book, but it was not for me. So, for you readers who are debating whether or not to read this book, here are my thoughts.The back cover did not shed light about how dark the content would be. There was no mention of a serial killer (much less one who drowned women), which may have better prepared me for the contents. It's not just that it was a serial killer, but how closely connected the characters were to people who were being killed. And... who the serial killer was. I figured it out about halfway and continued in horror of, \"Please be wrong.\" (I wasn't wrong)For me, it was too dark without a good balance of light. God was mentioned, as was prayer, but it was more of, \"I'll pray for you\" and \"God has His good will for your life.\" I found it to be somewhat shallow, and the characters in their everyday lives didn't think much about God.Another aspect I didn't care for was the romance. I could have read it wrong, but it appeared that one couple lived together before marriage (which is Biblically wrong to do). The romance was more surface-centered and a few things took place that made me cringe (mentions of going too far, being too close, that type of thing).So, coming from a conservative Christian viewpoint, this is not the type of book I'd like to read again.*I received this book from Book Look Bloggers and happily provided my honest review*"}, {"userName": "Diana", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18861432-diana", "userReview": "At the behest of so many Rock Harbor fans everywhere, Colleen Coble has stepped up to the plate and finally written another chilling tale of murder and mayhem\u2014set in the gorgeous snow-covered forests of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. 911 dispatcher, Dana Newell returns to her beloved small town, Rock Harbor, to escape her terrorizing, abusive ex-boyfriend and gets a lot more than she bargained for. As Dana becomes involved in an investigation of a malevolent serial killer she finds herself being stalked as well. Has her abusive ex found her\u2014and is he and the killer one and the same? As she and her new friend, Boone, search for answers, the heart-pounding tension heats up...romantic and otherwise! There was nothing about this book I didn't like and Ms. Coble did a jam up job scaring the living daylights out of me! Quite possibly her best Rock Harbor series book ever, I was totally swept away by the breathtaking beauty of the snowy landscape, frigid lakes, and small town charm. So immersed was I into this spine-tingling suspense that when my phone rang I almost jumped out of my skin, so you may not want to read it alone at night. lol No worries if you haven't devoured the rest of the series (but now you'll want to), this reads quite well as a stand-alone novel. The author does a great job of recapping the characters in the series and I was delighted to see them again\u2014especially some pretty awesome search-and-rescue dogs! A deliciously scary who-dun-it I highly recommend!

I loved getting to \"see\" Bree (and her family) and learn how things are in Rock Harbor. However, you do not need to read the previous books in the series in order to enjoy Beneath Copper Falls.The story grabbed my attention from the first chapter on and even though I was super busy when reading this, I couldn't wait to pick the story back up whenever I could.The mystery/suspense was awesome. I was able to guess the killer pretty early on, but that didn't stop me from staying intrigued and even second-guessing myself. ;)All in all, I loved Beneath Copper Falls and definitely recommend it!

I really enjoyed this trip back to Rock Harbor with new characters and old friends. Dana is determined to carve a new life away from an abusive boyfriend, and Boone just wants to be left alone. A murder and appearance of a nemesis throw the two together, but the questions and plot races ahead. It was great to be back with Bree, Kade, and their friends, but I loved the depth of the suspense and the hope of romance. Deep issues must be confronted before a future is possible, but those internal scars are the kind that are hard to erase.This book is perfect for those who love a tightly woven suspense that will keep you guessing just as the romance will keep you rooting for the past to be overcome so that a future can bloom."}, {"userName": "Stefanie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64200589-stefanie", "userReview": "It was so nice to be able to return to Rock Harbor and reunite with all of the wonderful characters again!Colleen Coble wrote a thriller that kept me page-turning even though this past month of craziness prevented me from reading this book quickly.Dana was such a lovable character and being able to meet her and Boone as new Rock Harbor characters was a treat.This was a fantastic read and really kept me on edge!

Romantic suspense with a few big plot twists, and a very exciting conclusion. This was one of my favorite series by this author, so I was excited to read this after finishing the others years ago. It made me want to go back and reread them all again. Some of the side characters I had forgotten, but it was easy to follow the story line. It can be read as a stand alone.A theme of seeking to please God more than people adds an inspirational side to the story, one that many of us could relate to. This author has a way of building the suspense, adding in an action-packed ending, making it hard to put down. A satisfying read overall. Recommend to fans of clean romantic suspense. 4.5 stars(An e-book was provided by NetGalley and the publisher.

Even pre-blog, y\u2019all. And the Rock Harbor series is comfort food for me. Which sounds odd to say about thrillers but \u2026 there\u2019s something about the Upper Peninsula community, its characters, and Coble\u2019s writing style that have the same effect on me as my favorite brownies. I can\u2019t \u2018eat\u2019 just one and I crave them on a regular basis.So imagine my delight when I found out Coble was giving us more books in the Rock Harbor series!Beneath Copper Falls is chilling, packed with suspense and impossible to put down. An abusive ex-boyfriend, a controlling new boyfriend, a potential serial killer on the loose \u2026 and the potential that this is all one and the same person. Or three different people. Or FIVE different people. WE DON\u2019T KNOW!! But we do know to keep looking over our shoulder through the whole book because crowbars smash windows and people get whacked on the head and the snow covers a lot of tracks!!!Ahem. Apparently I\u2019m not quite recovered from this read yet.Seriously edge-of-your-seat though. The suspects keep you guessing, and even once the real killer is figured out you still can\u2019t put down the book because you aren\u2019t 100% sure who is going to survive this one.And in the midst of all the RUN FOR YOUR LIVES (ahem) suspense, there is a sweet romance with shades of Phantom of the Opera and Beauty & the Beast. Boone and Dana both have scars, some more visible than others, but in each other they find a kindred wounded soul. Their instant connection develops into a great friendship and eventually into something more romantical. This aspect of the plot gives us a bit of a break from the stalking and the killing but it also leaves us breathless for different reasons.In Beneath Copper Falls, Coble addresses domestic abuse \u2013 and particularly how otherwise-strong women can be lured in by charisma and held captive by an abuser\u2019s charming other side. These glimpses into both the abuser and the abused would make this novel a great choice for a book club discussion.Bottom Line: Colleen Coble returns to Rock Harbor with a thrilling story, a swoony romance, and awesomely intelligent search and rescue DOGS. Some of the sentence structure messed with my reading speed for some reason, but you still won\u2019t want to put this book down once you start. Boone and Dana are nice additions to the Rock Harbor community, and fans of the series will enjoy catching up with Bree, Kade, Lauri, Anu, and the rest of the familiar faces. But Beneath Copper Falls works well as a stand alone too. Love the \u2018Gwen Marcey\u2019 cameo tucked away for fans of Carrie Stuart Parks\u2019 novels too!(I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book)first seen at Reading Is My SuperPower"}, {"userName": "Shalini", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57308589-shalini", "userReview": "Having read Colleen Coble before, I expected this book to have two things: suspense and romance.

Both genres are some of my favorite genres to read, so I'm drawn to Coble's writing in that way. I haven't read all her Rock Harbor series, but the number of them that I have read, I have enjoyed. With her newest installment of Beneath Copper Falls, I didn't feel disappointed.As a romantic suspense novel, it fits nicely into the genre. From the first chapter, I'm running alongside Dana as she wants to escape Garret and his abusive attitude. While the concept of an abused woman running away from her dilemmas has been done a number of times, I did enjoy that Coble didn't glorify it or hide the truth. She showed the horrors and allowed me to feel bad for Dana as she ran for her life. The suspense was well-written, and I had a hard time putting it down.The romance between Boone and Dana felt a little different. Both characters have to learn to look below the surface and learn to accept one another with their faults and learn to love each other. While the romance wasn't the focal point of the story, it did leave a nice sigh after watching the serial killer interact with the storyline.For fans of the Rock Harbor series, they will be excited to see well-loved characters and see what they are up to. I enjoyed this story and am glad that I read it. Fans of Lynette Eason and Irene Hannon who haven't sampled Coble's writing might want to check this series out.I received a complimentary copy of Beneath Copper Falls by Colleen Coble from Thomas Nelson publishing, but the opinions stated are all my own."}, {"userName": "Kav", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6025638-kav", "userReview": "A crazy twisty, turny, heart-in-throat, tummy-flip-flopping read! I'm still catching my breath. Partly because Coble takes us back to Rock Harbor - sqqquueeaaaal -- and Bree and her hero dog, Samson play a major role in this adventure -- double sqqqquuueeeaaalll. Mildly hyperventilating here because the first ever Colleen Coble book I read was Without a Trace, book 1 in this series and the beginning of Bree's story. So reading Beneath Copper Falls is like coming full circle and it's full of favourite characters from the other books. Mind you, it could still be read as a standalone for those who aren't familiar with this awesome series.This romantic suspense with a creepy stalker vibe kept me up at night trying to piece together clues and draw seemingly diverse threads together. There just never seemed to be a good place to put the book down! And it wasn't only the mystery that thrilled me -- the romance is divine! Dana with her resolve to take her life back. Boone dedicated to helping her do just that. He's a protector and she's running scared -- a relationship develops in the midst of tragedy which makes the tender bits all the sweeter.A thrilling addition to one of Colleen Coble's most loved series."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9945907-amy", "userReview": "Beneath Copper Falls is the sixth installment from the Rock Harbor series by Colleen Coble.

Perhaps even trying everything to keep your eye open including holding them open? Well that was my summary of how I spent last night as I began Beneath Copper Falls by Colleen Coble. Just the first three pages had my interest and I knew I was in for an adrenaline rush before my night was over. And yes, even as midnight approached I knew I had to finish this one. I had to know what was going to happen, I mean who can nod off to sleep while your characters fate hung in the balance, not knowing if they were going to live or die? Yup. Me again.Dana Newell was married after thinking she had found the perfect guy. But as we all know, there is no such things as the perfect guy. When all the warning sounds are going off around you, but you still believe you were meant to be. I mean she meet Garret through her brother Chris, when attending one of his military parties. They were good friends. She loved how focused on her he was never looking away and making her feel like she was the only one in the room for him. After countless threats, beatings and fearing for her life, she knew she had to escape. So she waited for her shift as a 911 operator to end, and she made her way back home to Washington, where her brother Chris was waiting for her. She knew he wouldn't let anything happen to her. She even managed to score another job working as a 911 dispatcher and soon life would be perfect. She knew that Garret would know she went back to her hometown, but Dana felt that with so many people she knew looking out for her that she would be safe. At least until she began to see signs that Garret was back and he was going to make sure Dana would come home with him, even if it meant taking out those who stood in his way, one by one. She finds solace and comfort in Boone Carter, a former smoke jumper who was badly burned and found that true love doesn't exist. At least when his fiance\u00e8 left him when she saw his face. Now he knows that no one can love him for who he really is, when all they can see is his scars. But even though Dana may not have visible scars, she still has them and soon her and Boone work together to ensure that Dana can defend herself if Garret gets too close. But will Boone become Garret's next target instead? I received Beneath Copper Falls by Colleen Coble compliments of Thomas Nelson Publishers and TLC Book Tours. This was one of the best murder mysteries I have read because one I was engaged I never wanted to turn my back on the action jumping off of the pages. It was heart-stopping, page turning, and trying to convince my eyes to read faster so I could know how it turns out. I love the interactions between Dana and Boone and love their friendship! That so many of us focus on what we see in people without getting to truly know them, but its on the inside the counts so much more. As the years go by and we age, we better hope that what we loved about someone is more than just skin deep! I wanted so much more and now will take a trip to my local library or book store to get all the Rock Harbor series novels. Who knew I could love a genre as much as I did this one! 5 out of 5 stars for keeping me wide awake til I finished and wanting more!!!

And although I have never written Ms. Coble asking for more books in the series, I was glad when BENEATH COPPER FALLS came out. I enjoyed getting to know Dana and Boone. I knew a bit about Dana's job thanks to my son's time working for the sheriff department and it was fun learning about Boone and what made him tick. The suspense - as my daughter said \"sounds scary.\" I asked if she wanted to read it and she said no, she doesn't do scary. She punctuated it with a shudder. It wasn't really all that scary, but as the reader I was kept awake one night trying to figure out who-dun-it and by the time I got up in the morning I had it figured out and then I had to finish the book to see if I was right. Ms. Coble does an excellent job with the red herrings and I think one has to be more than somewhat familiar with the genre to figure out her who-dun-it before the end, which is good because it will keep readers guessing! It was also great to revisit Bree, Kade, Adu, Laurie, Mason, and other familiar Rock Harbor characters--not to mention the Search and Rescue dogs. Great story.

It's the 6th novel in a series, but it's about Dana and Boone and so works as a stand-alone novel. The suspense is created by physical danger to a number of women. Dana's abusive ex-boyfriend followed her and is causing havoc. But then another woman dies, and it seems connected to an old murder investigation. Are the two cases connected? About halfway through, I realized from subtle clues where the book was heading, and then more obvious clues also pointed in that direction. This made the story even more suspenseful.When I was just a teenager, I briefly knew a manipulative man online who used some of the exact same words as this fictional serial killer. \"I though you were different from everyone else.\" Makes me wonder... Anyway, poor Dana has been traumatized throughout her life and now has an abusive, stalker boyfriend after her. Both she and Boone have to heal from past hurts. They make a great couple because they really do understand how the other is feeling, and they help each other stretch beyond hurt-imposed limits.The Christian element involved Dana finding the courage to pray with people on the job and Boone forgiving people who hurt him. There was no sex. The bad language was referred to with \"he cussed\" type phrases rather than with actual bad words. Overall, I'd recommend this exciting novel.I received this book as an ARC review copy from the publisher through Amazon Vine."}, {"userName": "Kelly Tyree", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40346972-kelly-tyree", "userReview": "Beneath Copper Falls was an incredible book that was definitely Colleen Coble's style.

She leaves him and heads to the safety of her friends and her brother in Rock Harbor. She takes a job as a dispatcher there. While she is there, she decides to take some self defense classes with her brother's friend, Boone. Both Boone and Dana have painful pasts that they are still trying to come to terms with. Boone's sister was killed by her fiance. His cousin, Allyson is convinced her death was not accidental. The closer she gets to the investigation, the more frightened she becomes. The more Dana and Boone get to know one another, the more feelings begin to develop between them. With all of the pain and rejection both have suffered, they have lots to overcome to make a go of their relationship. Dana's ex boyfriend is also making threats to come and take her with him as well. When Dana and Boone become involved in the investigation of the death of Boone's sister, the more the clues point to Dana's ex. When the killer's identity is exposed, it was a surprise for sure.

Particularly when the abuser is psychopathic enough to appear to everyone else but his victim that he\u2019s an outstanding guy deserving of more than being labeled the villain. Unfortunately too often women end up with PTSD and/or other forms of trauma from being kept far too long in these relationships because they either don\u2019t have access or feel like they don\u2019t to an escape route which Coble has exemplified in her story.Coble\u2019s keen character development and empathy for the human condition comes pouring forth from her dialogue and how she sets up the personalities involved in her story.If you\u2019ve been a fan of her Rock Harbor series then many of the characters and settings will be familiar as Bree Matthews returns with her trusty search-and-rescue companion. It\u2019s an excellent book as Coble handled such a difficult issue with grace and respect.

The romantic storyline is sweet and very encouraging, with a theme of looking at someone's heart rather than their outward appearance.Dana Newell returns home to Rock Harbor, Michigan, to live with her brother Chris. After suffering abuse at the hands of her fianc\u00e9, Dana seeks protection in the familiar surroundings and with friends and family. After starting a job as a 911 dispatcher, Dana receives a cryptic distress call from her friend Allyson. When Allyson's body is found, Dana teams up with Allyson's cousin Boone in order to investigate. Creepy things keep happening, especially as Boone and Dana grow closer. Is Dana's ex-fianc\u00e9 back to stalk her, or is something more sinister going on?"}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62693832-kelly", "userReview": "This is such a great story to jump back into the old Rock Harbor books. This is the next book that takes place in the town where Coble introduced us to more than a decade ago. The story follows Dana and her interactions with coming back home to Rock Harbor where she grew up as well as trying to outrun her ex-boyfriend. There are a few girls that have mysteriously murdered in the past few years and no leads on who the man is behind the killings. Dana pairs up with Boone, a man whose sister was one of the victims, and together they go searching for answers. The story has quite a bit of suspenseful moments, as well as some plot twists. The only thing I would like better is the ending. The end to the story is great and fulfilling, however, the climax happens with just a few pages remaining, so I feel like it is a little bit rushed. It would be nice for a little bit more to the rescue and wrapping up of who did it and why to give the readers a little more closure in the story. Overall all though, it was a great book - I would definitely recommend as a clean, suspenseful mystery! ** I received a free copy of the book to read for an unbiased review from Netgalley**"}, {"userName": "Babs", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1970552-babs", "userReview": "I love Collen Coble\u2019s books and this was not a disappointment.

Given the amount of time between this novel and others in the series, Coble builds in enough character development of all the characters so the reader can easily remember old friends or be introduced to them for the first time. The novel itself has a great plot--I did figure out who one of the antagonists was about halfway through. But highly enjoyed watching those in the book figure it out!I received an advanced reader copy from NetGalley."}, {"userName": "Denise", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5235744-denise", "userReview": "Another great book by Colleen Coble!
