To be able to believe fully in the reality of the circumstances in which a man finds himself, he must feel that they bear some relation, however distant, to other situations he has known.\u201d\n Paul BowlesNelson Dyar is desperate to escape that wire cage he\u2019s been working in for the past few years. When a chance comes to take an odd job in Tangier, he leaves the bank, leaves New York, in the hope that he will finally start to feel something. Wilcox is his boss in Tangier, but as far as Dyar can tell, he really doesn\u2019t have a job for him. He seems to just want to keep Dyar on a string in case he needs him for something. Dyar has plenty of time to meet the cast of characters hanging out in Tangier, all seemingly with their own agendas. In exasperation at one point, he says: \u201dCan\u2019t anyone in this town tell the truth?\u201d This betrays his own na\u00efvet\u00e9 and inability to adjust to the environment he has thrust himself into. Tangier is a city in flux, and those who are there are not as interested in sharing the truth as they are in acquiring the truth. Deception is all just part of the game. Paul Bowles takes the title of this novel from Macbeth. \nBanquo: It will be rain to-night.1st. Murderer: Let it come down.(They set upon Banquo.)\nBowles is impressed with the the succinctness and brutality of those four words. It certainly has connotations for me as I watch Dyar make these horrible decisions that lead him one step at a time closer to his own downfall. The first step, he falls in lust with a sixteen year old, Arabian whore named Hadija. He wants to possess her, but so do other men and even a fat, American lesbian named Eunice Goode, who is intent on taking this girl out of Tangier. Hadija has a beauty that is tempered by a feral ambition to use what gifts were naturally bestowed upon her to advance her position in life. She will always be for sale and will never return the love that anyone lavishes upon her. Dyar takes money from a Russian woman to be a spy. \u201d\u2019R-r-really we ask very little,\u2019 she smiled. \u2018You must not have r-r-romantic idea this is spying. There is nothing to spy in Tangier. Tangier has not interest to anyone. Diplomatic perhaps, yes. Military, no.\u2019\u201d Oh well, then there isn\u2019t really any reason for Dyar to get in trouble for taking money from a foreign government, is there? *sigh* The lesbian American actually provides one of the most interesting descriptions of Dyar. \u201dShe had liked imposing men, such as her father had been. This one was not at all distinguished in appearance. He did not look like an actor or a statesman or an artist, nor yet like a workman, a businessman or an athlete. For some reason she thought he looked rather like a wire-haired terrier---alert, eager, suggestible.\u201d Daisy de Valverde, another American ex-pat, doesn\u2019t really find him attractive in the way that she has found other men to be, including her husband. The men she found worthy of her attention were all powerful, assertive men. Dyar, in comparison, seems so passive. I don\u2019t know if it is boredom or what, but she does seduce him with the help of Majoun, hashish laced, greenish candy. The sex is not exactly what she had hoped for. It is rather fierce and messy. \u201dShe squirmed violently and managed to sit up, bathed in sweat, wine and grease. The air of the room suddenly seemed bitter cold. She ran her hand tentatively over her stomach and drew it back, disgusted.\u201dBowles is not explicit with the details of this sexual encounter, but this description gives us a better perception of what occurred than if he had written us a grope by grope play by play. I really liked Daisy and so I was disappointed in her for seducing Dyar because I appreciate her sophistication and tasteful regard for the finer things in life. There is not anything grand or even interesting about the vacuous Dyar. He is out of place in the bed of such a woman. Wilcox does finally have a use for him, and Dyar rather ineptly decides this is his moment to break free and do something definable with his life. Daisy has an observation about him that sums him up very well: \u201d...you have an empty life. No pattern. And nothing in you to give you any purpose. Most people can\u2019t help following some kind of design. They do it automatically because it\u2019s in their nature. It\u2019s that that saves them, pulls them up short. They can't help themselves. But you\u2019re safe from being saved.\u201d A stinging last bit there, as if she is saying to him you are hardly worth saving. I\u2019m a little annoyed with Bowles that he doesn\u2019t give me something to like about Dyar. I want to rip Dyar out of the pages of this book and insert myself. I keep thinking, what a wonderful opportunity this young dolt has, and he can\u2019t stop himself from mucking it all up. He can\u2019t even enjoy himself properly without expressing some dissatisfaction. He left New York to escape his life, but no big surprise he can\u2019t escape himself. Regardless of my irritation with the main character, there is some beautiful writing. \u201dThami began to sing in a small, faraway voice. It was a sound you could walk on, a soft carpet that stretched before him across the flat blinding desert. Ijbed selkha men rasou\u2026.\u201dOr how about this description?\u201dThe soft endless earth spread out beneath him, glowing with sunlight, untouched by time, uninhabited, belonging wholly to him. How far below it lay, he could not have said, gliding soundlessly through the pure luminous air that admitted no possibility of distance or dimension. Yet he could touch its smooth resilient contours, smell its odor of sun, and even taste the salt left in its pores by the sea in some unremembered age.\u201d\nFrom what I know of Paul Bowles, he seemed a man always slightly adrift from life. He wrote only a handful of novels, but they are fascinating studies by a man who had to always keep in mind \u201dI must remember I exist.\u201dIf you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit http://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at: https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten"}, {"userName": "Warwick", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53165-warwick", "userReview": "I read all of Bowles in a frenzy when I lived in Morocco, and I was 18 years old and it was the first time I'd seen anything of the world and the first time I'd fallen in love and all the other kinds of firsts that you have at that time in your life. His books have stayed in my head like almost nothing else I read back then \u2013 I only have to open them now and I smell thuya wood and the smoke from the snail-sellers and I see the hotel room of a girl I haven't seen for real in nearly two decades. And they still don't really seem to be part of any identifiable tradition, these books \u2013 somewhat Beat-ish but very different from the Beats that stayed in America, a voice both American and distinctly foreign, an expat's voice, deeply knowledgeable of other cultures but (unlike, say, Louis de Berni\u00e8res, who I read around the same time) never allowing you inside those cultures: instead they are about alienation and the impossibility of any real cross-cultural understanding.Most of all they are, to me, unique in their pitiless control over narrative shape, especially when this comes at the expense of his characters. His stories do not come together at the end like stories are \u2018supposed\u2019 to: they peter out in scenes of bleak, compositional simplicity \u2013 like woodcuts, or etchings, or the last bare notes on a musical staff. You feel that you've been left, staring aghast at tiny figures stranded in a vast landscape. At 18 I felt that The Sheltering Sky was put together like no other novel, and nearly twenty years later I still can't disagree. His short story \u2018A Distant Episode\u2019 features a spasm of violence as appallingly rococo as anything in American Psycho, but it also felt significant and real to me in a way that Brett Easton Ellis never even came close to.And then there's Let It Come Down, the book of his that I admire most. Everything about it impresses me, starting with the title, and its source in Macbeth:BANQUO: It will be Rayne to Night.1ST MURD.: Let it come downe.(They set upon Banquo.)In his 1980 introduction Bowles describes the line as an \u2018admirable four-word sentence, succinct and brutal\u2019 \u2013 and his admiration at this combination of succinctness with brutality will become apparent in the novel's unforeseeable climax.Along the way he does a lot of what he does best. This includes his descriptions of altered states, which are the best I've read. And this was important to me at the time, because I felt permanently high from travel and new experiences, and I had a constant feeling that the world was like one of those 3D magic-eye pictures that I was just on the verge of seeing \u2013 a feeling that Bowles captures very well.Everything he took the trouble to look at carefully seemed to be bristling with an intense but undecipherable meaning: Daisy\u2019s face with its halo of white pillows, the light pouring over the array of bottles on the table, the glistening black floor and the irregular black and white stripes on the skins at his feet, the darker and more distant parts of the room by the windows where the motionless curtains almost touched the floor. Each thing was uttering a wordless but vital message which was a key, a symbol, but which there was no hope of seizing or understanding.He apparently wrote his toughest scenes while spaced-out on majoun, a sort of hashish jam that the magic-men used to sell in the souks when I lived there, laid out next to the ostrich eggs and the open vials of liquid mercury. Perhaps that is what gives his writing its strange quality of inhuman, distant brilliance. There is something cold about him \u2013 easy to admire, hard to love. But terribly underrated, really one of the most fascinating writers in terms of constructing a story that you could hope to read. The ending of this one hit me in the gut when I first got to it, and every time I flick through the climactic paragraphs I get the same feeling. Like all of Bowles's most memorable moments, it is shocking because it is impossible to understand. I don't mean the prose, which is always clear and sharp \u2013 but rather the motives, the aimlessness of what happens. He reminds you how unpredictable people are, how un-novelistic life is, how unknowable even your own behaviour can be."}, {"userName": "Agnieszka", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2446508-agnieszka", "userReview": "Nelson Dyar, young bank clerk thinks his life ran into the buffers. Being rather unreflecting and submissive by nature awaits that real life will come to him itself. His days pass on thoughtless and unsatisfying work so when gets an offer of a job from an old pal treats it as a godsend and opportunity to escape from his cage. In sudden impulse he throws everything and set off to Morocco in search for luck and own identity.On the spot, contrary to all expectations, things don\u2019t change for the better. Tangier these days with its International Zone is a place of dodgy businesses, Mecca for expats, adventurers and all kind of frauds and rich idlers. Promised job appears to be a vague chimera, met people try use him to own purposes, city offering forbidden gaieties draws him like shifting sands and so Dyar, alternately drunk and zonked, finds himself being thief and smuggler, traitor and spy. Not bad for a start.Dyar is a tragic though not lovable figure. By whole years sneaks through life, automatically accompanies passing days, by nights gathering strengths to outlive another dull day. There is some strangeness and emotional emptiness about him, he's not agonizing himself about questions if such life is anything worth. Actually he\u2019s not dead though the fact that he can breathe doesn\u2019t yet make him alive. Paul Bowles is really good at depicturing local colour. Tangier, as it emerges from the novel, is a strangely intoxicating, sombre, yet atmospheric place. A maze of dark and dangerous streets of the Muslim district, seedy brothels, crowded pubs where the locals in the haze of hashish to the accompaniment of drums indulge themselves in ecstatic dances, secret cinemas displaying illegally porn. Well, there is a rain yet. In Tangier incessantly rains ,the rain just pours from the pages of the book . Bowles perfectly captures the dark atmosphere of postwar chaos drawing an evocative picture of a decadent city and its inhabitants involving in dirty games.  Let it Come Down  reads like ominous warning when disdain and arrogance of Westerners in contacts with other cultures leads to inevitable disaster."}, {"userName": "Jacob Overmark", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41670556-jacob-overmark", "userReview": "The grass is always greener on the other side of the fenceHow often have we not felt that a change of environment would be just the right thing. Escape all that ties you down, a new beginning, the chance to set everything right, get the recognition you deserve. To most of us such change would be just a little premeditated, but to Nelson Dyar \u2026 it is just an escape. Let it come down; the quote from \u201c1st Murderer\u201d in Macbeth is the equivalent of the fatalistic \u201cWhatever!\u201d. You could easily take it forward to the next Macbeth scene when Macbeth tell us that \u201cI am in blood. Stepped in so far that, should I wade no more,. Returning were as tedious as go o'er.\u201d In other words, there is no turning back.Arriving in the then International Zone of Tangier, Nelson Dyar, a former bank clerk, is supposed to take up a job in an acquaintance\u2019s travel agency. A promising career in a land of opportunities. The travel agency turns out to be just the fronting of a few other shadier kinds of businesses \u2013 and in the course of the novel we will know if Nelson Dyar is up to it.But first we will get to know Nelson Dyar a little better. Initially he is a blank card, picked up for a Celtic Cross Tarot session with the standard set-up, the first seven cards representing \u201cThis Covers You\u201d, \u201cThis Crosses You\u201d, \u201cWhat Lies Below\u201d, \u201cWhat Lies Behind\u201d, \u201cWhat Lies Above\u201d, \u201cWhat Lies Before\u201d, \u201cYourself\u201d.We are trying to establish who you are, what\u00b4s inside you, your dreams and hopes. Sadly, we see very little expect the most urgent physical needs. You feel attraction, even a kind of love, but you are not able to interpret these feelings. Will a change of environment change a person? To some extent, yes. Tangier just before the Moroccan independence, is a place where wolf eat wolf. The Brits, the French and the Spanish are upholding an internal cease-fire with each part struggling to gain and maintain as much influence as possible. Opportunities are there for the taking, provided your moral compass is not too tightly adjusted and you have the right connections \u2013 or you are born wealthy. Either way, life can be easy if you know how to circumvent local legislation and you are not placed to far down in the food chain. But it takes skills, skills of the interpersonal kind which Nelson Dyar doesn\u00b4t have and thus he will inevitably end up as wolf food if not something drastic happens, the one chance that will change the game forever.So, we walk out into the Moroccan night, looking for friends or alliances, builds ourselves an armor, because deep down we know that none of the people we meet can be trusted. We get drunk in the company of strangers, because only when we lose the control can we bear the knowledge that we are not in control at all. Even when high as a kite on several pipes of kif, the mind does not expand, it does not open new doors of consciousness, only highlights the vast emptiness. Staying with Shakespeare; we may quote Hamlet\u00b4s last words; \u201cThe rest is Silence\u201d. Though it can be read as such, this is not a cautionary tale. It is more of an observation, watching how a man with limited prospects interacts with a society that in all ways differ from his hometown New York. How he like an inexperienced spider on speed entangles himself in a net he doesn\u00b4t even see. How one step leads to another and signs are not read. Paul Bowles do not judge neither Nelson Dyar or the people surrounding him. They just happen to be there at a certain point and play a significant role. To a certain degree they influenced Nelson Dyar, and he could have made other choices, he could have stood up or held back, he just did not have it in him. An enjoyable 4.5 read, generously rounded up to 5 stars, because I really like Paul Bowles and the pictures he was able to create in my mind."}, {"userName": "Mariel", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/647547-mariel", "userReview": "If only existence could be cut down to the pinpoint of here and now, with no echoes reverberating from the past, no tinglings of expectation from time not yet arrived!A man inprismed in his waiting life to happen to him. The standing on your feet in a cage day after day turning into a decade never happened. He knew he couldn't get it back in a mind place that doesn't touch get up and live your life. One day the sun didn't set on maybe tomorrow I'll do that thing that's going to change it all. I know this too well in my \"Maybe I'll win the lottery even though I never play\" or \"Maybe I'll die before I need to\" retirement plans. The all the other day after plans of not being like this yesterday's sun. Whatever happens to time when it's gone it's that kind of stale light of plans. Dyar has this as the battery of thirty something sun rises and sets. Quit the bank, roll away from the families. An armored armadillo ball . Hide from predators and somewhere else. So go to Tangier where an old family friend has started up a tourist business. I'm surprised that he did that much. If I knew him, I mean, I would be surprised that he ever did anything. Time stops for him. Somehow the contents of the fleshy genie jar retains its nothing shape anywhere.The international zone of Morocco was time travelling like one of those ghost films and no one can read your lips and chilly ghost walk through them. The faceless foreigners can't exploit them anymore, maybe, or just one last fuck over. The neighbors will too, if they get a chance like some Christmas future after you've remembered a lifetime of bad karma you haven't done yet. No one trusts anyone. Maybe they shouldn't. It's like that switch you wait for when your soul is sick of belonging to you. Maybe there is something you can do, maybe like just waiting. A change. Hawk your turtle shell for nothing at the time. That non-friend friend non-business associate says he'll call him. Wait for him. What is he doing there, in Tangier? Walk around, wait, think and there for you are. It doesn't come to him. Just the hug from god is dead and nothing matters from the pipe. Nothing on his mind and his mind on his tummy. The meaningless smile on a hooker. They disappear into shadows of enemies in victim Dyar's what the hell is he doing here. I read the New York Times review from 1952. I don't agree with the writer that Dyar is a blank eyed cipher, exactly. He gets drunk on the sun. It isn't only the kif that unsettles his skin. Not moved outside of himself, maybe. I feel like he's a man imprisoned who doesn't know what the outside is, only that to be so trapped is a long way to die. An inhuman nightmare for feeling dead. A ghost story if you were already dead. When Dyar murders literally it is too late for him. I didn't feel connected to the murderer or the victim, it's as if it had happened such a long time ago that they'd be dead already. Something has already moved on without them and it's never going to happen whatever could happen to be born. I thought Paul Bowles was brilliant when Dyar has already forgotten what he told the rich lady Daisy (in her butterfly's cocoon of money and socialite talkity talk) he wants from life. Truth? I have forgotten what he said he wanted too. If anyone ever asked me what I wanted out of life - I can't remember if anyone ever has asked me that - I don't know. Now I think Dyar said he wanted to feel like any of it meant anything at all. I would want to feel like I could breathe, pretty much. It's not all that important to me that Dyar was empty or not. Daisy thinks she might like him because he's empty (until she knows for sure). How could he be if he felt so weighted? I have forgotten her when she appears again, though. He's not weighted by her or any of them in Tangier, or back home as real people. Only like big bad history and future and a question that wakes you up when you thought you finally fell asleep. It's funny how much it felt like living his life with them until I had forgotten them. I didn't know I was going to be in a nightmare until it happened. Bowles really crept it up on me, kinda like getting used to Dyar's weight of nothing. The feeling of unreality was too strong in him, all around him. Sharp as a toothache, definite as the smell of ammonia, yet impalpable, unlocatable, a great smear across the lens of his consciousness. And the blurred perceptions that resulted from it produced a sensation of vertigo."}, {"userName": "metaphor", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5685453-metaphor", "userReview": "Once more after finishing \"Let It Come Down\" by Paul Bowles I have become aware that some people are doomed to self-destruction and they rush there from their unhappiness and loneliness, from inability to adapt the surrounding reality, from consuming inside emptiness which tells them keep going from there. There is no escape from this horror of existence \" a certain day, at a certain moment, the house would crumble and nothing would be left but dust and rubble, indistinguishable from the talus of gravel that lay below the cliffs. It would be absolutely silent, the falling of the house, like a film that goes on running after the sound apparatus has broken.\" Together with us the time will slowly dissolve falling to pieces and nobody would care that once \" there were places in time to be visited, faces to forget, words to understand, silences to be studied\", only the inhuman night will remain.I am not horrified with the end of the novel, I knew I was reading Paul Bowles, I am not disgusted with the protagonist Dyar, I only feel pity for him and experience an immense fear of a fragile human soul that may break any moment searching for its place, \"a definite status, a precise relationship with the rest of men\" in a hostile world that we are responsible for creating ourselves.I am amazed how through all the novel, the rain deciphers the coming events: it pours, rains heavily or calmly, it can rain indifferently or dip in a desultory fashion, it rains lightly bringing hope with a soft sound of falling, it offers watery sky, wet gray colorless twilight and in the end of the novel it produces the dead flat sound spreading around. The same is with the wind which blows from all the directions changing from a sweet breeze to a wind which carries the paralyzing promise of winter or a strong malevolent evil clattering the door.I think I have learnt one simple truth from Paul Bowles: the dreamers can't be happy, you must have simple daily achievable goals to feel content just to be alive on a fine sunny morning, however, one thing is to realize it, quite another to try to turn your thoughts off."}, {"userName": "Duffy Pratt", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2729963-duffy-pratt", "userReview": "It's not clear to me whether Dyar goes to Tangiers to kill himself, or if he ends up killing himself because he went to Tangier. Either way, he is aptly named, and his story is both creepy and surprisingly unengaging. At times, I got the feeling we were looking at him like an insect on a pin. That said, Bowles writing is lucid, musical, and often powerful. I generally liked the characters, even with their indifference to all sorts of petty horrors. And I did like Dyar's spiral towards doom, and his almost casual acceptance of it. The book is basically a series of misadventures, each worse than the last, and the only question that remains is which one will finally catch up and do him in.In general, I think Bowles fairs better in the short story than in the novel. He is capable of writing very powerful images and scenes, but somehow seems to lack the stamina to write a fully engaging and coherent novel. I liked this one less than The Sheltering Sky, but I think I will turn again to the short stories I haven't read before taking on The Spider's House."}, {"userName": "Stephen Durrant", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1457001-stephen-durrant", "userReview": "Bowles novels are typically set in Morocco, where he lived for so many decades. The setting is meticulously and convincingly portrayed, but this novel, like his more famous \"The Sheltering Sky,\" is not so much about setting as it is about youthful ennui and the desire to experience another world that might jolt one into a more authentic existence. In Bowles novels that place is Morocco in the 40's and 50's, but it could be just as easily any number of \"foreign\" environments. Almost all young people, I think, have sometimes desired this shift to another reality, and many of us acted on that desire, for better or for worse. But most youthful wanderers, especially those who survived, were neither as naive nor nihilistically inclined as Nelson Dyar, the protagonist of \"Let It Come Down,\" who leaves his job in New York City as a bank teller (speaking of ennui!) to take up an unspecified and probably shady job in the very corrupt international zone of Tangiers. Soon he is clearly in over his head and finds himself in a place where almost all meanings and connections escape him. Or maybe he has reached that point Kafka once described (and Bowles quotes in his preface): \"From a certain point onward there is no longer any turning back. That is the point that must be reached.\" The premise and general curve of this novel is much the same as \"The Sheltering Sky,\" but it is shorter and somewhat less complex, providing a good entrance into Bowles' dark vision of a world in which we are all just one step away from entering a very enticing, quite unknown, and perhaps even unknowable \"danger zone.\""}, {"userName": "Max Nemtsov",

Half-Baked is the only \"drug\" movie I've ever been able to sit through. All the rest seemed like they would be boring as hell. Like watching paint dry. Which, I guess if you were on weed might seem entertaining. LICD starts well. The characters are interesting, identifiable, the locale mystical, exotic. There's a lady with more money than she knows what to do with. I liked her. She spent most of her time giving lavish dinner parties, bored out of her mind. Problems arose after Bowles introduced Dyar, the main character, to kif. From there, the scenes involved one Hey-hey-we're-the-Monkees...on-weed scene after another. I gather we were supposed to feel something for Dyar for the idiotic decisions he made. At first, when he was looking for something beyond the humdrum life he lead back in New York, I was right there with him. Hell yes, Brother Dyar, life can become monotonous. But when all he found to do was have some drug-induced daydream/nightmare after another, I could not have cared less. He got himself into trouble early on, and the only way out, it seemed, was checking out. I can understand checking out, but experiencing a drug-induced daydream is (I'm assuming) a lot more fun than reading about someone experiencing them. Near the end I turned on the Kindle's text to speech and had daydreams of my own as the electro-voice droned nearby. And the detours. Holy kif crystals, the detours. The moment a scene became interesting, I believe Bowles recognized it, sought to destroy it. Felt like riding uphill in a jalopy with two flat tires.

I became fascinated with Paul Bowles in the early nineties, after someone loaned me a copy of The Sheltering Sky. There is something of the haunting power of the Other that pervades EM Forster's A Passage to India in that novel, but with a more existential outlook, unique to Bowles' narratives.By the time I read Let It Come Down, I had a hearty appetite for the detailed descriptions of his storytelling.It's like the descriptions of the protagonist's experiences in Morocco are a mirror of the layered circles of his consciousness. You go deeper, and deeper, and deeper--seeing how, in a place that does not know you, where you can become lost forever, and where potential danger hangs around every corner, can become the only place that you can be truly free. Every seemingly scary moment, where the protagonist's very survival and self-identity come into question, become somehow liberating and beautiful.I recommend it to anyone who likes a good story about the way people come to terms with themselves through the lens of an unfamiliar place."}, {"userName": "Christopher Sutch", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2475981-christopher-sutch", "userReview": "This is a gripping novel about an American who is wholly ignorant of the culture he finds himself immersed in. He was, however, also rather \"empty\" even back in America. This is pretty standard territory for Bowles, but this novel seemed to me to be a particularly existentialist novel in philosophy, something I had not considered that Bowles might have subscribed to (though, having just written that, it seems pretty obvious that he would have been; it was THE philosophy of the times). This is sort of a crime novel, sort of a travel narrative, and sort of an object lesson about the effects of markets and economics on some Americans. The ending shocked me with a fairly grisly turn, and I appreciated that.

A primary reason is that he mistakes his impulses for the \"true self\" and hopes to find his way by not thinking much about what he does. The fourth and the last part of the novel, which is almost exclusively about Dyar and his situation aggravated further by Moroccan drugs, was not as absorbing as the preceding three, presumably because it was all about a man pronounced \"dead\" quite early in the novel. So we all knew a bad thing was going to happen to him, no surprise there. I was more curious to find out where and how Bowles is going to say goodbye to his character. Will he be dead-dead or just mad? I won't be a spoiler. The depiction of the international and native society in Morocco of that time is what made me like the novel so much.

Bowles had a successful career as a composer in New York City, but in mid-life he changed to literature and moved to Tangier. After rereading Bowles' first and most famous novel, \"The Sheltering Sky\", I turned to Bowles' second novel, \"Let it Come Down\" (1952).\"Let it Come Down\" is set in post- WW II Tangier, in the waning days when it constituted an international zone. During this time, Tangier was essentially lawless. It was a haven for expatriates with eccentric lifestyles including, for example, Bowles himself. The primary character in the novel is an American, Nelson Dyar, 30, who journeys to Tangier out of a vague feeling of boredom and dissatisfaction with his life in the United States. Dyar worked as a bank teller but had no real friends, love affairs, or interests. He moves to Tangier when an old acquaintance from childhood, Wilcox, invited him to join his travel agency, an inherently shady and questionable venture in the Tangier of the time.Bowles' novel traces the gradual descent and change in character of the milquetoastish and indifferent main character. In its style, it is a mix. It has strong elements of humor and irony and in places almost becomes a comedy of manners. The prevailing tone is dark and brooding.Through the hapless Dyar, Bowles offers a vivid portrayal of Tangier and its people. From the moment he gets off the boat, Dyar becomes emeshed in intrigue with other expatriates in Tangier and with the natives. His job with Wilcox immediately takes an illicit turn. The insufferably na\u00efve Dyar finds a woman whom he takes to be the love of his life working in a brothel while she is also kept by a wealthy American woman. The book includes many scenes of parties among the wealthy expatriates and the more influential Arabs. The book also has scenes of narrow winding streets, dangerous bars, shabby hotels, and of the locals. Tangier in the book is incessantly drenched in rain. The book includes psychedelic scenes describing the use of hashish and kif, substances in which Bowles freely indulged when he moved to Tangier. With all the lightness of some of its parts, the book and Dyar's life descend inexorably into violence.The book reads slowly. With all the action, depictions of place, and violence, the book includes a great deal of philosophizing about the need to let go of one's past and try to live and to enjoy life. Bowles' characters are trapped in their anger.This second novel has the same broad themes as does \"The Sheltering Sky\" but is less effective in its long scenes of parties and expatriate society life than is the former novel with its unremitting starkness. The novel, nevertheless, is absorbing in its portrayal of Tangier and in its depiction of the face of a callow and initially unsuspecting young American. The novel is available individually or in a Library of America compilation of three novels of Paul Bowles.Robin Friedman"}, {"userName": "Eric Franklin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7478358-eric-franklin", "userReview": "\"Let it Come Down\" is the story of Nelson Dyar, a young man of no crowning achievements, nor direction, save to find some way to \"live.\" As a result of his dissatisfaction with a bank teller job, he flees America for a loosely described job opportunity in Tangier.
