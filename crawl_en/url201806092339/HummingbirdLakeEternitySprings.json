The heroine in this book has a serious issue with post traumatic stress syndrome and a heart breaking story to go along with it, but jeez she was just a mean nut case who turned on friends, family and strangers.

Cole is a former professor and now works in the bureaucracy in Washington. His family used to spend summers in Eternity Springs and it is a place for him to un-wind. Nic goes into labor and it is Sage our heroine, the resident artist of Eternity Springs and former(secret) doctor who has to deliver the babies. She does so, but has a complete meltdown in front of Cole later and they share a kiss. That is it. Fast forward a few months.We don't know much about what happened in Sage's past but we do know that she was a doctor who worked in Africa, and something happened there that changed her so completely, that she left her old life to start a new one, she is friends with Nic, Sarah Reese(who has a college-bound daughter Lori) and Ali(a visitor to ES , whose husband is a federal judge). All these people we met in the first book, along with a little mystery of a missing bride which dates back to the town's history and founders. All this may seem feel confusing to a new reader but to understand and enjoy this book better, one should read Angel's Rest. Sage is plagued by nightmares and she is extremely private about her new life. She paints, but her painting are of two types: one hidden and a reflection of her nightmares and the other she shows the world(nature and its beauty).Sage then goes for her gallery showing and runs into Cole who comes to see her show, he is shocked and surprised by her art as it lacks the depth and emotion he can glimpse in her eyes. They kiss again but Sage has a flash-back that ends in her screaming.When they next meet after a few months, Sage hasn't been doing well, her nightmares have increased robbing her of sleep. Cole comes to ES after an incident at work where he nearly lost it, he has come to relax for 2 weeks. They become neighbours and they slowly start becoming friends due to the efforts of Cole, we see them connect emotionally and later intimately(not shown on screen, I mean it isn't described as it is in most books). Sage's friends are worried about her but she rebuffs them.We learn about Sage's family as well, how she was raised by her disciplined army father she calls Colonel and how she is estranged from her older sister Rose(we learn more about her when she comes to ES and things come to a head).Cole returns again later to ES and that is when their relationship really deepens, Sage puts roads-block but Cole just smashes them. When Sage finally let's go we see the depth of her suffering and Cole and Rose are there.Unlike most books, the relationship doesn't develop over a few weeks, but months.ES books also show a sense of community and friendship. I really enjoyed the book, maybe more than the first one. Read it, but better start with the first book Angel's Rest."}, {"userName": "Ana", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1316580-ana", "userReview": "[the shooting and the fact that she had to save an evil man (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Eve", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10494178-eve", "userReview": "This is Sage and Colt's story. I enjoyed book #3 in Eternity Springs series, so I was looking forward to reading this one. But I was quite dissapointed in Hummingbird Lake because the heroine acted way too neurotic for my taste. Its clear that there was some kind of tragic event in Sage's past that still affected her but it didn't seem to justify all her theatrics. Unfortunately the author goes on too long without more closely explaining Sage's past, so by the time I found out about it, I gave up caring. I felt that no one around her deserved Sage's bad temper and temper trantrums in present -- they had always treated her nicely and it wasn't their fault that something like this happened to her in Africa! I was also wondering why Cold would fall in love with someone like her. I think in real life no man would keep coming back for more of Sage's emotional acts.

Her enchanting narrative pairs with her picturesque descriptions in a way that allowed me to really experience the setting. March really gives readers a feel for the town and its workings. I loved the mix of small town romance with the faith/heeling aspect of the story. Yet March makes this story so real. It doesn\u2019t have that hokey feel that I find in so many inspirational romances. She\u2019s never trying to shove concepts at readers, simply telling her characters\u2019 stories. The main characters were a bit of a conundrum. Colt kept pushing Sage for more, yet Sage refused to tell him why it wasn't possible for her. I appreciated both of their tenacities and understood where both were coming from. The fact that they were both so genuine, if a bit unwilling to share all their secrets all at once was so real. And I really enjoyed how we get to know more about so many of the characters in this town. Sage\u2019s friends are priceless. They are the epitome of small town women with a twist. I love Celeste\u2019s angel in disguise feel. This was certainly a warm and restorative novel, with some rather emotional moments that brought me to tears. I love how March kept me engaged throughout with this complexly real story where she delves deep into the world of survivors and those around them."}, {"userName": "Debbie Oxier", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21813445-debbie-oxier", "userReview": "This book was one of those you didn't want to put down. The characters were outstanding and the author did such an excellent job of writing about them it was as if they'd stepped right off the pages of the book into my living room. This was one of those intensely emotional stories you find yourself getting caught up in from the get go. Sage Anderson was a very complex heroine. She was a former pediatric surgeon that served for a time with Doctors Without Borders in Africa. While there she suffered a terrible trauma, including seeing her fiance murdered before her eyes. As a result, she walked away from medicine, moved to the small town of Eternity Springs and now paints. Her artwork is just beginning to really take off. Of course, no one knows about the paintings she creates at night, born of her nightmares when she finds it impossible to sleep. Not even her closest friends know about her past or the fact she was a doctor. She prefers to keep it that way so as to avoid any unpleasant questions or prying into her background. She simply can't, and won't, talk about it with anyone. Why should she when she's dealing with it on her own? Isn't she?She convinces herself of that fact until she meets Colt Rafferty. He is an environmental inspector and his job requires him traveling as well as working with victims of environmental disasters. He's no stranger to trauma and recognizes the signs in Sage shortly after meeting her. Not only is he attracted physically to the woman, but she represents a challenge to him when he attempts to find out more about her and discovers she's strangely uncooperative. However, Colt isn't one to give up easily. He keeps pushing and prodding, insinuating himself into her life until little by little he begins to break through her walls. Sage isn't happy about it but she finds herself turning to Colt whenever those same walls start closing in around her. A couple of times she has a complete meltdown and he holds her and comforts her, easing her through it. When Sage's sister, Rose, someone she's been estranged from for years, arrives in town wanting to reconcile, it only adds to Sage's stress. When Rose confesses she has cancer, Colt knows the two women need each other and he attempts to persuade Sage to give Rose a chance. He inadvertently becomes their go-between, a fact he resents at first, until he finds he can learn a lot more about Sage by talking to Rose. There is also a time when her friends push her to become involved in a project that would require Sage work with children, something she refuses to do because of her past. She ends up in a huge argument with her friends and storms out, then isolates herself from everyone as she gets lost in a dark web of depression and flashbacks. I really appreciated the way the author dealt with the situation as Sage's friends only wanted to help but had no idea as to the extent of what she'd been through and Sage, with all her secrets isn't at all forthcoming. However, she realizes that she's going to have to open up at some point, which scares her to death, going to that dark place in her life, a place she never wanted to visit again at the risk of it destroying her.I loved Colt dearly. He so calmly informed Sage he loved her and wasn't giving up on her no matter how hard she tried to push him away. Yes, there were times he got frustrated, but he knew she would eventually tell him everything and in the meantime, he was always there when she needed him. He even made an attempt to get her to talk to a therapist and read up on everything having to do with PTSD, which he was positive she suffered from. Sage, in turn, was locked in her own private shell, tormented by her memories of the past but so desperately wanting to be free. She loves Colt and finds it a miracle that he's put up with her so-called craziness. You can't help but feel for her and what she's going through. While reading her story, you so desperately want her to succeed and end up being with Colt simply because he's one heck of a man and deserves being happy with the one woman he knows would make him so. I actually hated parting with these two although I took comfort in the fact they would be around for the next books in the series. I hoped to check in with them from time to time to see how they were getting along. If you want a story that grabs at your emotions and won't let go, this is one for you.

Images she will never let anyone see.Visiting Eternity Springs, Colt is immediately drawn to the enigma of Sage Anderson, but the torment of her soul which he has glimpsed doesn't match the fanciful pictures of fairies she produces for public consumption.Hummingbird Lake is the second in the ongoing Eternity Springs series.

I liked this one a little better than the last, but I felt like it was alllll about Sage in the relationship. Colt is pretty much every woman's dream man! I know Sage was dealing with PTSD issues from this horrible thing that happened to her, and I understand that, but not once did they talk about him and what he felt other than him telling her how much he loved her. Honestly, he had the patience of a saint and when she finally pushed him over the edge, everyone told him how he needed to have more patience.Sage came around, of course, and it was nice to see her journey from completely whack to relatively sane. I loved catching up with everyone else in the town. I know the next book is about Ali and I can deal, but I seriously want Sarah's story already! She deserves a happy ending.

We know Sage will get \"cured\", we know Rafferty will marry her. I like many more twists and turns in my books. I found it unrealisitic that Sage couldn't just tell her friends, \"something really bad happened and I can't talk about it, am traumatized, etc. I found everything about this plot unrealistic. Things didn't happen in a natural way, too many things \"just happened\" without the author working to make us believe them.

THIS NOVEL PAINTED A BREATHTAKING, HEARTWARMING PICTURE OF THE HEALING THAT A PERSON CAN UNDERGO WHEN HE/SHE FINALLY ALLOWS HIMSELF/HERSELF TO BE EMBRACED BY THE LOVE, SUPPORT, AND UNDERSTANDING THAT ONLY TRUE FRIENDS CAN OFFER! FRIENDSHIP, LOVE, AND SUPPORT WERE EMOTIONS THAT ABOUNDED FREELY FROM THE RESIDENTS OF ETERNITY SPRINGS, COLORADO! THE SMALL, SECLUDED MOUNTAIN TOWN WAS FOUNDED ON BELIEF IN GOD, FAMILY, COMMUNITY, AND TRADITION; THUS, THE RESIDENTS WHO RESIDE IN ETERNITY SPRINGS, COLORADO, ALWAYS RALLY TO HELP ONE OF THEIR OWN WHENEVER HE/SHE IS SWALLOWED UP AND SWAMPED BY A CRIPPLING, DEVASTATING, AND HORRIFYING PAST THAT HE/SHE IS CONVINCED CAN NEVER BE OVERCOME! EMILY MARCH BROUGHT THE SMALL, SECLUDED MOUNTAIN TOWN OF ETERNITY SPRINGS, COLORADO, TO LIFE, ONCE AGAIN, IN SUCH AN AMAZING, BEAUTIFUL, AND MAGICAL WAY! USING YET ANOTHER PSEUDONYM, GERALYN DAWSON CLEARLY DONNED A TOTALLY DIFFERENT PERSONA IN ORDER TO WRITE THIS NOVEL -- AND THE ENSUING SERIES THAT RESULTED BECAUSE OF THE PUBLICATION OF THE PREVIOUS NOVEL -- THAN SHE EVER HAD BEFORE IN HER CAREER! THEREFORE, I THINK THAT THOSE READERS WHO HAVE READ GERALYN DAWSON'S NOVELS BEFORE SHOULD TRULY ENJOY THIS NOVEL! ALSO, GERALYN DAWSON'S READERS SHOULD ALSO TRULY ENJOY THE BEAUTIFUL PERSONA AND THE ENCHANTED, GENTLE STYLE IN WHICH SHE BECOMES EMILY MARCH!HUMMINGBIRD LAKE, the second novel included in the Eternity Springs series, is the fifth novel (albeit sixth work) that I have read by Emily March. And, this time, this charming, clever, and talented storyteller actually FINALLY EMBRACED that pseudonym in order to introduce her audience to the small, secluded mountain town of Eternity Springs, Colorado. After reading ANGEL'S REST, the first novel included in the Eternity Springs series, I knew that this community was a TRULY SPECIAL place to live; thus, I was anxious to discover just what wonderful breakthroughs and occurrences that Emily March had in store for the other residents living in Eternity Springs, Colorado. And... I must admit that having the opportunity to build a deeper relationship with Sage Anderson throughout the course of the plot of HUMMINGBIRD LAKE was definitely NOT a disappointment. In ANGEL'S REST, Emily March expertly depicted Sage Anderson as an artistic, intriguing, and quirky woman. However, having said that, Emily March revealed that Eternity Springs resident artist was also hiding a rather difficult secret underneath her bubbly, effervescent, mysterious, and uplifting personality. Or, more specifically, a personality that proved to actually be NOTHING MORE than a bubbly, effervescent, mysterious, and uplifting facade. For, you see... In ANGEL'S REST, Emily March revealed that Sage Anderson had actually studied medicine and worked as a surgeon BEFORE she ever came to Eternity Springs, Colorado. Sage Anderson even revived those dormant medical skills to oversee Dr. Nicole Sullivan Callahan's high-risk pregnancy with twins. Sadly, though, what did agreeing to take care of an expectant friend cost Sage Anderson emotionally?Sage Anderson had NOT shared her previous profession with anyone when she moved to AND decided to settle in Eternity Springs, Colorado, permanently. Likewise, she had NOT shared the horrific incidents that led up to her leaving the medical field all together. Sage Anderson pursued painting when she moved to Eternity Springs, Colorado, and she had managed to build up quite a career, name, and reputation for herself as an artist in the time that she had lived there. As a result of the alternate career path that she had chosen, Sage Anderson felt that she was spared the burden of having to share her deepest, darkest, and most shameful secrets with her closest friends in the community. Until Nicole Sullivan Callahan needed her help, love, and support during her pregnancy, anyway, that is... Then, as if the constant curiosity and questions from Celeste Blessing, Nicole Sullivan Callahan, Sarah Reese, Lori Reese, and Allison Timberlake were NOT annoying enough to Sage, this resident artist FINALLY comes face-to-face with a man she thought that she did NOT like. And, strangely enough, this man was someone whom Sage did NOT even know. Emily March allowed Sage Anderson to come face-to-face with Colt Rafferty at the grand opening of Angel's Rest Healing Center. Because Colt Rafferty dabbled in wood carving as a hobby -- and produced BEAUTIFUL, MAGNIFICENT creations, indeed -- Sage Anderson thought of him as an artistic rival and threat. However... Having said that, the dynamic that developed between Sage Anderson and Colt Rafferty AFTER their first meeting at the opening of Angel's Rest Healing Center proved to be NOTHING LESS than monumental! The circumstances that led up to that first major encounter AND the unfolding moments of that scene proved to be beautiful and heartbreaking. From that point forward, Colt Rafferty saw it as his personal mission to \"figure out\" Sage Anderson. So... As a result of the relationship that was established between this handsome, persistent and this beautiful, stubborn, terrified woman, Emily March set her audience up for yet ANOTHER rip-roaring, fire-cracking roller coaster of a ride in Eternity Springs, Colorado! And... Emily March brought up these questions in order to enrich the plot line of HUMMINGBIRD LAKE(1) Will Sage Anderson let Colt Rafferty pursue her? (2) Will Sage Anderson take a chance -- confide her deep, dark, horrifying secrets to Colt Rafferty?(3) Will Sage Anderson forgive AND mend her broken relationship with her older sister, Dr. Rose Anderson?(4) Will Sage Anderson FINALLY let go of her anger enough to FINALLY entrust her closest friends with intimate, painful details of her past? Will she seek their love and support? (5) Will Sage Anderson FINALLY acknowledge her need to seek professional help in order to truly conquer PTSD?(6) Will Sage Anderson and Colt Rafferty pursue a romantic relationship? Will it be successful OR end in hurt?Therefore, I truly enjoyed reading HUMMINGBIRD LAKE! I was enthralled with the overall charm displayed between Sage Anderson and Colt Rafferty from beginning to end! Then, during those moments in the novel that Sage relived those bone-chilling, devastating, and horrific moments in her past, I was absolutely clinging to the edge of my seat! So... After reading both ANGEL'S REST and HUMMINGBIRD LAKE, I can NOT wait to discover what other breakthroughs and occurrences that Emily March will have in store for Gabe and Nic Callahan; Sage Anderson and Colt Rafferty; Sarah Reese, Lori Reese and Chase Timberlake; Allison Timberlake, Celeste Blessing -- as well as all of the other residents of Eternity Springs, Colorado, in the future!

Not even her closest friends know about her past or the fact she was a doctor. She prefers to keep it that way so as to avoid any unpleasant questions or prying into her background. She simply can't, and won't, talk about it with anyone. Why should she when she's dealing with it on her own? Isn't she?She convinces herself of that fact until she meets Colt Rafferty. He is an environmental inspector and his job requires him traveling as well as working with victims of environmental disasters. He's no stranger to trauma and recognizes the signs in Sage shortly after meeting her. Not only is he attracted physically to the woman, but she represents a challenge to him when he attempts to find out more about her and discovers she's strangely uncooperative. However, Colt isn't one to give up easily. He keeps pushing and prodding, insinuating himself into her life until little by little he begins to break through her walls. Sage isn't happy about it but she finds herself turning to Colt whenever those same walls start closing in around her. A couple of times she has a complete meltdown and he holds her and comforts her, easing her through it. When Sage's sister, Rose, someone she's been estranged from for years, arrives in town wanting to reconcile, it only adds to Sage's stress. When Rose confesses she has cancer, Colt knows the two women need each other and he attempts to persuade Sage to give Rose a chance. He inadvertently becomes their go-between, a fact he resents at first, until he finds he can learn a lot more about Sage by talking to Rose. There is also a time when her friends push her to become involved in a project that would require Sage work with children, something she refuses to do because of her past. She ends up in a huge argument with her friends and storms out, then isolates herself from everyone as she gets lost in a dark web of depression and flashbacks. I really appreciated the way the author dealt with the situation as Sage's friends only wanted to help but had no idea as to the extent of what she'd been through and Sage, with all her secrets isn't at all forthcoming. However, she realizes that she's going to have to open up at some point, which scares her to death, going to that dark place in her life, a place she never wanted to visit again at the risk of it destroying her.I loved Colt dearly. He so calmly informed Sage he loved her and wasn't giving up on her no matter how hard she tried to push him away. Yes, there were times he got frustrated, but he knew she would eventually tell him everything and in the meantime, he was always there when she needed him. He even made an attempt to get her to talk to a therapist and read up on everything having to do with PTSD, which he was positive she suffered from. Sage, in turn, was locked in her own private shell, tormented by her memories of the past but so desperately wanting to be free. She loves Colt and finds it a miracle that he's put up with her so-called craziness. You can't help but feel for her and what she's going through. While reading her story, you so desperately want her to succeed and end up being with Colt simply because he's one heck of a man and deserves being happy with the one woman he knows would make him so. ****Dr. Sage Anderson, pediatric surgeon, is a tortured soul! A beautiful young woman that is so haunted by memories, she gives up medicine and comes to Eternity Springs searching for peace and a hope for a future where she is no longer plagued by nightmares from her past. Turning to her childhood love of painting, she looses herself in the battle to purge her demons. She becomes successful in her work but unsuccessful in her personal battle. If there ever was a woman with true grit, it would be Sage Anderson. She is an amazing woman and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever wanted anyone to have their HEA as badly as I wanted this for her. Dr. Colt Rafferty, Chemical Engineer & former professor now serves the country as a Safety Investigator. While investigating industrial explosions is part of his job, his goal is to educate and prevent these type tragedies. Frustrated and angered by a job where companies are more concerned with lawsuits than saving lives, Colt finds himself in need of a break and much needed R&R. Growing up he spent his summers in Eternity Springs and now it has become a refuge for Colt. This brilliant, sexy man at heart is an artist, creating magnificent carvings from wood and his soul is fed by all the wonder found there. From his very first meeting with Sage he is intrigued. He likes this prickly proud woman with the flowing red hair and big green eyes. And after only a short time he finds himself wanting to pursue a relationship with her. And even though Sage knows she is in a dark place and not ready for this, she can\u2019t resist Colt. And I just don\u2019t know who could?:) Tall, swoon-worthy handsome, sinfully sexy with piercing blue eyes and a hard, muscled body and 6-pack abs...WOW \u2013 one fine looking man and a master in the bedroom! I luuuvvd him..but not only for his body and looks!:) No Way! \u2013 There is depth here ---character, intelligence, honesty, sooo much tenderness and a fine sense of humor.  I loved his Persistence \u2013 he never gave up on Sage; when all others did, he was her soft place to fall, her sanctuary! She wasn\u2019t going to let him in so he was determined to draw her out! The romantic in me loved his methods and don\u2019t we all at times need a soft place to land! His Patience \u2013 Sage could not bring herself to tell the terrible tragedy that causes her demons, but Colt never pushes her into reliving her nightmare. Somehow he knows this would be a horror too great for her to bear. His Perception \u2013 he recognizes she is in a dark place and knows she\u2019s fought long & hard to escape; but the solitary struggle is weighing her down. His interest in the mystery of her increased. His heart ached for her. What is the core and cause of her pain? And Sage, she is a broken soul, in a dark place, tortured, searching for a sanctuary, looking for a soft place to fall when the flashbacks come and spins her into panic. Colt\u2019s persistence frightens her. She tells him she has so much baggage and a dark \u2013 ugly pain that is so deep it is stamped into her DNA. Why could Colt make her cry when she couldn\u2019t cry on her own? Why does she feel so safe and protected when with him?There is so much more to this story than dark despair; there is laughter and tenderness. There is sensual, sexy heat. We also get to visit with the citizens of E.S. and catch up on what\u2019s happening in the town and in their lives. The ongoing mystery continues, we get to meet new characters and by the end I came away wondering if there could be any truth in what most of the citizens believe \u2013 \u201cEternity Springs \u2013 The valley that nurses a special energy that soothes troubled souls\u201d. ***Sage is currently a successful painter, but has had a very dark, violent past in her work with Doctors without Borders. The only person she has told the whole story to was her military father, who more or less belittled her depression & PTSD. 3 days after she told him, he died of a stroke, so she never had closure. She also was cut off from her sister, who never understood what had happened. Colt had been a summer resident in Eternity Springs since he was a child. He has now come back after years away in a government job that included a lot of travel. He is very taken with Sage, who tries to push him away. He continues to pursue her, but although she wants to be whole for him, she cannot share her past & doesn't feel she deserves love. Her sister comes into the picture looking to reconcile & Sage pushes her away also. There is a lot of angst in this story, but eventual healing, of course with the understanding and persistence of Celeste added in the mix."}, {"userName": "Marcia", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8823221-marcia", "userReview": "Second book in the series, although I have not yet read the first.
