Did you read the first book in the series, Lost And Found Sisters? If you did, then you met Tilly Adams as a teenager struggling with growing up, loss and love. Now she\u2019s twenty-five years old. This novella is her story! Not to mention the update we get on Mick and Quinn\u2019s life. Tilly\u2019s dream was to be a famous artist, and to live happily ever after with the love of her life, Dylan Scott. Only neither happened. She\u2019s definitely not famous and actually is getting ready for her very first day as an art teacher at the local community college in her hometown of Wildstone, CA. And, Dylan left her eight years ago and she hasn\u2019t heard from him since. So when she finds a cold, wet, malnutritioned little puppy under a bench, she wonders if she is adult enough, reliable enough, to care for the little guy. It didn\u2019t take long, though for her to fall in love with him and he became her fiercest protector. Especially protecting her against the man that walked away from her, the man who broke her heart into a million pieces. The man who is now back in Wildstone.Dylan did what he thought was best all those years ago walking away. Four years in the military and four years flying helicopters in South America and he\u2019s back. He is opening a helicopter tours business with his two best friends, Penn and Ric. He knew she would be there but thought they could avoid each other. He should have known better than that. He could no more stay away from her than he could stop needing oxygen. \n\u201cI thought I\u2019d let myself down, but then you came along and saw me as a better version of myself.\u201d\nThere were many truths left untold when Dylan left all those years ago. Now he needs Tilly to give him a chance to explain, to tell her why he left. That is if he can get past her guard dog. Will what they shared all those years ago still be as strong as it was? Will she forgive him? \n\u201cI\u2019m too broken for this.\u201d\u201cLast I checked, we\u2019re all a little broken. And yet we still live and breathe. And love.\u201d\nI loved this. In the first book I fell so in love with Mick, Quinn, Tilly and Dylan. So it makes it all the more special to see Tilly and Dylan all grown up now and get their chance at their own happy ever after. There are a lot of secrets that need to be revealed, and a lot of forgiving that needs to be done. Is the love they shared as teens still there, still enough? Or was it just a teenage infatuation. Is what they once shared enough to build a future on?"}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5210022-julie", "userReview": "The Good Luck Sister by Jill Shalvis is a 2018 Headline Eternal publication. This is a follow-up novella to \u2018Lost and Found Sisters\u201d featuring Quinn\u2019s sister, Tilly Adams. The last we heard from Tilly, she was an edgy, angsty teenager. But now she is all grown up and teaching a college art class. Sadly, she and her best friend and first love, Dylan, went their separate ways, breaking Tilly\u2019s heart in the process. Suffice it to say that when Dylan shows up in her art class, she\u2019s not exactly overjoyed to see him. But, he needs an advertising logo for his new helicopter tour company, so he approaches her with a job offer she can\u2019t refuse. Once Dylan convinces Tilly to design his logo, he starts to work convincing her to give them one more chance. Will Tilly finally understand that now is their time or is it too late?This is a super sweet story, about two people who were meant for each other, but needed to grow up, find their niche, and work through personal demons before they settled into an adult relationship. Flashbacks give the reader a glimpse into Tilly and Dylan\u2019s teenage relationship and the abusive background Dylan had to overcome. This is an emotional story, but Shalvis has always balanced her stories with a healthy dose of humor. While this is Tilly and Dylan\u2019s second chance story, I have to say Quinn nearly steals the show which her hilarious remarks. The story has a truly funny, but romantic conclusion, and was the perfect HEA ending for this very special couple.

What I love so much about her writing is what she doesn't say. Odd, right? But where a lot of authors tell you that a character is this and that way she shows you without actually saying it.Tilly isn't completely satisfied with her life. She feels that her big dreams from her youth to be an artist have never come completely to fruition. To pay her pills she decided to teach art and on her first day at her hometown's college she comes face to face with her past. The boy she once loved has grown into a sexy man.\n\u201cYou were my best friend and the love of my life, and you never even looked back. You\u2019re such an asshole.\u201d\nThe boy loved the girl, she was his reason to make it through the day when he had to bear the brunt of his abusive dad's anger. The boy left one day without looking back and returned after ten years.\u00a0Now Dylan is back and he wants to make things right between Tilly and him.Tilly is such a lovely and a little quirky character. Each chapter starts with a line out of her diary and it gives her character so much depth. When Dylan comes back into her life all she wants is deny his existence but if she's the unmovable object he's the unstoppable force. I loved that Tilly didn't make me wait too long for her to see the heart of Dylan. There was no forced angst or unreasonable doubt on her behalf. When she learns the reasons why the boy left ten years ago it is is pretty much smooth sailing.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think I was capable of love back then, and I wasn\u2019t. Not until you. I loved you, God I loved you, but I had nothing to offer you.\u201d\nDylan is a sweet man with a single-minded determination you find in people who have gone through painful experiences and came out on the other side being better for it. His love for Tilly is obvious pretty much right from the start. Even when she gives him the cold shoulder treatment he doesn't give up. Dylan's witty and oh so considerate, honest and sweet and I loved how he was with her puppy. Leo, the puppy, was a character. So cute and precious.\n\u201cLook, man,\u201d he said. \u201cWe both love our girl, right?\u201dLeo stopped growling.\u201cRight,\u201d Dylan said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t know what your plans are, but I\u2019m just going to remind you that I saw her first. And I\u2019m happy to share her with you, though that offer\u2019s for you and only you. It\u2019s a good deal, I\u2019d take it if I was you. Think about it.\u201d\nI don't think there are many authors out there who can make me smile, giggle and swoon that much in a book like Jill Shalvis. She has conquered my heart with her beautiful words and if I have one complaint about this novella, then it is that there wasn't enough Dylan and Tilly. I loved these two and now I'm looking forward to the next installment in this series.One last word - while this is marked Women's Fiction I would still classify it as Contemporary Romance. But if that is what Women's Fiction a la Jill Shalvis is, I take it any day."}, {"userName": "Claire Robinson", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14026987-claire-robinson", "userReview": "5-\"Still think I'm smooth..?\" Stars!With each new story I read, I fall in love a little more with Jill Shalvis\u2019 writing. Book one in the Wildstone series introduced us to troubled teens Tilly Adams and Dylan Scott. Their story didn\u2019t have a happy ending in that book, and rightly so it was the wrong time for them as a couple to reach the right conclusion in regards to a relationship. The Good Luck Sister with a little time jump (ten years to be precise) revisits Tilly and Dylan, and things have changed massively for both of them. One returning from war, the other still kicking around Wildstone making the most of their opportunities the best they can.\"You did it\u2026 You got out and made something of yourself\u2026\"I loved this pair in Lost and Found Sisters so to see them finally get their happily ever after, was just perfect for me. Their reconnection isn\u2019t completely smooth sailing, Dylan\u2019s departure at the end of book one, left more than a few bruises on Tilly\u2019s immature heart, but you as a reader knew it was the best thing for both of them, it takes Dylan a little longer to convince Tilly of that though, and the ever present chemistry between them became combustible pretty quickly.\"It\u2019s all about the we\u2026 Don\u2019t ever think otherwise.\"This novella jumps between the past and the present, I liked that it gave depth to everything they had gone through as teens, it also gave an even deeper understanding as to how much it broke Tilly\u2019s heart when Dylan left without taking her feelings into consideration.\"What do you want to be when you get older..?\"\"Alive.\"I loved The Good Luck Sister and like with all Shalvis offerings, I wish it had been longer, but it was the perfect little morsel to sink my teeth into, and keep me ticking over until the next book in the series; Rainy Day Friends is released in June.ARC generously provided, in exchange for the above honest review."}, {"userName": "DJ Sakata", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18344018-dj-sakata", "userReview": "Favorite Quotes:There\u2019s like ten different levels of dating now before you actually date.

It is no secret that I am a huge fan of Jill Shalvis and this story had everything I was looking for when I pick up a book with her name on the cover. I loved the first book in this series, Lost and Found Sisters, so I was very eager to return to Wildstone for another story. Once I started reading this story, I simply could not put it down and ended up finishing it with a big smile on my face.This story features Tilly and Dylan, both of whom played a part in the first book in the series. If you haven't read the first book, there is no need to worry because this story can easily be read as a stand alone. This story is set in the future and Tilly and Dylan are both all grown up now. They were both teenagers in the first installment so it was great to see them in adulthood. The story does include flashes from their past which was a really nice reminder for me and readers new to the series will quickly get the background information that they need to enjoy this installment. The characters were great in this story. I loved Tilly and Dylan in the first book and I quickly discovered that I liked the adults they have become. There is a cute puppy in the story that melted my heart from the very beginning of the story. I did think that Quinn seemed a bit over the top in this one but it was all done in fun. I love that humor was flawlessly worked into the story and the quotes at the start of each chapter always brought a smile to my face.I liked Tilly and Dylan together and am really happy that they were able to get their second chance. Although things have not worked out exactly as they had hoped, they have both made the most of the situation they have found themselves in. Their relationship did move pretty fast in this book but that tends to be the case in most novellas. They had fantastic chemistry with each other and their feelings for each other felt very genuine.I would recommend this novella to others. This was a wonderful story filled with great characters, a few laughs, and a touching romance. I can't wait to read more of this great series very soon.I received a digital review copy of this book from William Morrow Paperbacks via Edelweiss.Initial ThoughtsThis was a nice novella. I liked that parts of their past were shown during every chapter. I read the previous book so the flashes back to the past was a really nice reminder. Readers who are new to the series will not have to worry about missing anything either since we get a lot of their past in this story. Things moved pretty fast in this story as they tend to do with shorter pieces but it seemed to work. I did think that Quinn was a little too much at times in this story. I had a nice time with this one in the end."}, {"userName": "Elle \u2726 Pretty Little Books \u2726", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44344367-elle-pretty-little-books", "userReview": "Release Date:  May 1, 2018 Genre:  Contemporary RomanceA cute, enjoyable, and quick read!

Many readers wanted to know what happened to these two as the thread was touching, filled with domestic violence and it seemed the odds were stacked against them.Ten years have passed, and Shalvis shares\u00a0the story giving us both the past and the present as she updates\u00a0us along the way. This was a touching, sweet story as Tilly begins her first day of teaching and discovers Dylan sitting in the front of the class. Since this was a short novel the romance in the present moves pretty fast once we get past the initial issues with Dylan having left town without saying goodbye. Shalvis took the time to explain and shared his history.Shalvis brings a little heat, but it is mostly fade to black. Instead, the story focuses more on healing a love that has never really faded.We get updates on Quinn and Mack that made me smile and laugh.

Jill Shalvis has listened to her fans and our wish is her command. With a bibbidi-bobbidi-boo (and a few hours in the hot seat thinking and writing, thinking and writing) we have Tilly and Dylan\u2019s love story come to life in\u2026dah\u2026dah\u2026dah\u2026The Good Luck Sister.I really enjoyed this little treat. Sure, I would have loved it to be longer but I was still satisfied with this sweet love story that took me through the highs and lows of their second chance at love. I don\u2019t always believe in second chances at love. It\u2019s hard to forgive heartbreak and hard to forget the pain. BUT\u2026I think it\u2019s a little different when the first time was in high school. Not, that I think high school romances are anything to sneeze at, it\u2019s just that there\u2019s still so much time for people to grow and mature. Mistakes are a little easier to forgive when they\u2019re made by hormonal and inexperienced teenagers. Hopefully with time they learn and make better decisions about life and love.So, Dylan\u2019s runner into the army, I could forgive, especially considering he thought he was doing the right thing \u2013 AND \u2013 he didn\u2019t have a good family support system in place to guide him. Yes, he hurt Tilly but it was easy to see that he never really moved on from her. By the end, I couldn\u2019t help but admire Dylan for the man he became.Tilly is still the quirky girl I came to love in Lost and Found Sisters. She\u2019s obviously matured but I think in some ways, she\u2019s still the vulnerable girl who thinks everyone will leave her. It takes her mistakenly making a quick judgement to realise that she\u2019s always thinking the worst. Tilly starts to realise that the successes she\u2019s always wanted are achievable, she just has to believe in herself.I\u2019m not normally a fan of time-jumping in my reads. In The Good Luck Sister it was a good reminder of stuff that previously happened while also helping us realise how young and immature they were. This time around they\u2019re ready for all the feelings and have no doubts that the chemistry and connection they have is real.A great chance to catch up with Quinn and Mick too. You could see that Quinn and Tilly's relationship has strengthened but you also see that Quinn forms a strong link to Dylan too. Mick is still AWESOME!!If you\u2019re a Jill Shalvis fan and enjoyed her first foray into Women\u2019s Fiction with the Wildstone series, you will definitely enjoy The Good Luck Sister.Stacey is Sassy, received a complimentary copy of this story.

Told in Tilly\u2019s POV and interspersed with flashbacks from eight years ago, it gives readers both the opportunity to catch up and an insider\u2019s outlook about Tilly and Dylan\u2019s story as teenagers.At the time both were experiencing heavy family issues, Tilly was this angsty and surly teenager, Dylan was her best friend and first love until he suddenly left without giving anyone a warning, least of all a devastated Tilly. There had been an awful lot of unrequited love then between them too.Eight years later, it\u2019s time for Tilly and Dylan to collide again, and learn about each other anew. Although they both did a lot of growing and maturing during their time apart, Tilly is still hurting from Dylan\u2019s leaving her and is not sure how to feel about his now relentless pursuing.Dylan knows he had something real with her before he ruined it , he\u2019s coming back his heart and mind clear of the past troubles, well intent on making amends to Tilly. He wants back in her heart and prove her he is here to stay.There is little to no angst from this tiptoeing situation, just enough to give our romance reader\u2019s heart a pinch. Despite Tilly\u2019s reservations regarding Dylan reappearance she\u2019s quick to listen to her heart and to let emotions and passion fly.Jill Shalvis graces us with yet another adorable and fickle little beast of a dog, creating some sweet and adorable duels of mights between man and canine over who\u2019s getting the girl. We\u2019re also getting snippets of other characters from the first book, especially some hilarious and tender moments from Quinn and Mick.

This has in no way influenced my voluntary review, which is honest and unbiased *The Good Luck Sister is yet another feel-good romance from Shalvis! I really enjoyed getting to know Tilly and Dylan better! Story: The Good Luck Sister is short, but sweet. It's set several years after Lost and Found Sisters, and it shows Tilly all grown up. But still confused about life. And still sharing her wisdom at the beginning of the chapters.I loved that while Tilly was now an adult, there were traits of her character she still had from her teens. She is not one to forgive easily, and if she feels like she's been faulted, she's stoic. The Good Luck Sister showed that she is capable of letting the past go, though. But not without the other person having to work for it.Dylan has totally carved out a new life for himself. Starting a charter helicopter company with some of his army buddies, and trying to be better made my heart sing for him. The Good Luck Sister also included some snippets from the main characters' past, so even if you haven't read the first full book, you'd definitely enjoy this one!Tilly's little dog, Leo, was also a full character in the story, and I just loved how Shalvis managed to share a dog with such a big personality with me.Of course, I'm such a sucker for second-chance romances, and The Good Luck Sister gave me this in such a beautiful way. Young love can be slightly blind. Or it can make people do what they think is noble. And that's what Dylan did - until the day he walked back into Tilly's life with flair. Feels : All the good feels here! I read The Good Luck Sister a while ago, and just thinking of it now, writing my review makes me feel all happy again.He was a destructo of the highest magnitude, and something else too. He had no idea how small he was. He went after her sister Quinn's twenty-pound cat and her neighbor's hundred pound black lab with the same fierce, fearless gusto. Turned out, the little guy had a bad case of small-man syndrome, which was how he'd earned his name. Leo, short for Napoleon.She did not expect him to begin stripping out of his clothes. He kicked off his athletic shoes first, then his socks, which hit the floor with a soggy 'smack'. He pulled off his windbreaker, which had been suctioned to his chest and back and made a very wet pop as he freed himself of it, like the nylon didn't want to let go of hi.

While I loved that about it, I also kind of wished for more as well. Some aspects felt underdeveloped and that\u2019s probably due to the word count restraint. The author was able to take advantage of the fact that this is a second chance love story, so some of those emotions are already there. They just need to be resurfaced.

While this story may be a novella, it certainly hits all the marks. The Good Luck Sister follows the story of Dylan and Tilly. They fell in love at a young age and couldn\u2019t wait to see what life would hold for them. However, Dylan\u2019s life was anything but easy. He made many tough decisions; decisions that hurt, but he thought were for the best. It would be many years before these two would reunited. And when life presented Dylan with a second chance, he was going to grab on to it with everything he\u2019s got.Overall, I thought this novella was a terrific read. I loved getting to fall in love with Dylan and Tilly. I loved getting to see the memories of when Dylan and Tilly were younger. It really added to the story and gave me a real feel for who they were. I loved seeing how far both characters had come despite the choices that were made.The Good Luck Sister is a terrific short story and a great addition to the Wildstone Series. With plenty of steam and swoon worthy moments, this short story should not be missed.*I was provided an ARC copy of this book, in exchange for an honest review*"}, {"userName": "Aly", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3528600-aly", "userReview": "3.75 If you read book one, it's almost impossible your forgot about Tilly Adams, the rebellious fifteen-year-old whose mom died and learned about the existence of her sister Quinn, who took care of her. Do you also remember she was friend with and had a crush on Dylan, a teenager with an alcoholic father who beat him and his mom ? Tilly certainly never forgot him nor the fact he broke her heart when he left Wildstone a decade ago and never looked back. The young woman dreamed of being an artist but it never really took off for her and she'll teach it instead. For her first day of teaching graphic design at the community college, she's in it for a big surprise. Is that really Dylan Scott sitting in her class or does she hallucinate ? Why is he back after having no trouble going away and never keeping in touch ? What does he want ? And is she ready to give it to him ? It's a quick romance but it worked, because Tilly and Dylan never stopped loving each other during all these years and there was no hard feelings between them, only the sadness of being away from each other. There's also flashback from Tilly and Dylan's teenage years. If you're familiar with Jill Shalvis's work and family life, you'll be happy to know this novella include a furry character (just check the cover ;p) with a colorful personality, a character inspired from the dog of the author's daughter."}, {"userName": "Nurse Lisa In Ohio (PRN Book Reviews)", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6058074-nurse-lisa-in-ohio-prn-book-reviews", "userReview": "Thank you, Jill Shalvis, for giving us this story set about ten years later!

It is a novella, short and sweet, but it packed a punch that went straight to my heart. Tilly and Dylan are from the first book, The Lost and Found Sisters and it was great reconnecting with them as adults. Tilly went to school to further her art talent and always thought she would become a famous artist while living the rest of her life with her true love, Dylan. Neither of those things happened. Dylan took off eight years ago and never looked back. Of course, Tilly's heart was shattered. Dylan was the only boy she ever loved and was hurt badly when he walked away without a word to Tilly.Well, it's eight years later and Tilly is nowhere near famous. On her first day of her new job as an art teacher at the local community college, who is sitting in her class? Yup, Dylan! Hang on tight readers, it's going to be one crazy and fun ride! THE GOOD LUCK SISTER had my emotions all over the place, so badly that I wanted to run to Wildstone and slap the hell out of Dylan. I get the reasons why he left, but why couldn't he have explained it all to Tilly before he ran? Why did he open his helicopter business in Wildstone of all places? How did he go eight years without so much as a phone call or postcard to Tilly? All she did was love him and care for him all those years ago. What did she do to make him run away?THE GOOD LUCK SISTER is about Dylan coming home and trying to explain why he left to Tilly. I loved him in the first book and even though he broke my heart when he left I was praying that Tilly would forgive him. As secrets are uncovered I was holding my breath, praying everything would work out in the end for Tilly and Dylan. Flashbacks to when Dylan and Tilly were teenagers give the reader a taste of what they were like back then and what they were going through. Brilliant Jill Shalvis, just brilliant! She made me sad, then the next moment I was smiling and giggling out loud and swooning for Dylan! I'm so excited to continue with the Wildstone series. You can never go wrong with a Jill Shalvis story and if you are in a reading slump, her books pull you right out!"}, {"userName": "Kimberly", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3232771-kimberly", "userReview": "Reviewed for \nWit and Sin\n\nThe Good Luck Sister\n is a great pick-me-up read. I adored Tilly and Dylan as teenagers in Lost and Found Sisters, so I dove into their story, eager to see what they\u2019d be like as adults.It\u2019s been ten years since Dylan left Wildstone, breaking not only Tilly\u2019s heart but his own. Now he has returned and the pull between them is as strong as ever. Tilly is understandably wary of letting Dylan in again, but he\u2019s patient and determined to win her trust back. Both of them are a wonderful mixture of strength and vulnerability. They\u2019re also incredibly fun and have great chemistry. The result is a romance that draws you in and I defy you not to root for these two to get their happily ever after.\nThe Good Luck Sister\n moves back and forth between Dylan and Tilly\u2019s past and present and the flashbacks might just be my favorite part of the story. Tilly and Dylan were best friends as teenagers and the way that they supported one another grabbed my heart. Dylan grew up with an abusive father and Tilly suffered the devastating loss of her mother. Both of them carry scars that broke my heart, but I absolutely loved how they cared for and encouraged one another. Even though Dylan eventually leaves to make his way in the world and to push Tilly to seize her own chance, it\u2019s clear that these two were always destined to find their way back to each other.Dylan and Tilly are the heart and soul of \nThe Good Luck Sister\n, but the supporting cast adds a wealth of humor to the story. Dylan\u2019s friends Penn and Ric are delightful (and I\u2019d love to read stories about them) and fans of Lost and Found Sisters are sure to enjoy an update on Quinn (now pregnant and absolutely zany) and Mick. And of course Tilly has a kooky dog who threatens to steal the show more than once. Jill Shalvis writes some of the funniest four-legged friends out there, so how could I not fall in love with Leo, aka Napoleon (as in complex)? All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed \nThe Good Luck Sister\n. It\u2019s a fast-paced, charming read with entertaining characters and a romance that will leave you smiling.FTC Disclosure: I received this book for free from the author in exchange for an honest review.

I've read just about every trope you can think of by her and she is just wonderful. Her stories warm my heart and just all the right spots. The Good Luck Sister was no different. AND it's a short story. You guys, this woman has skills I tell ya! I'm not gonna lie and say I didn't wish the story was more because who wouldn't, but it was really perfect the way it was. These two friends getting a second chance to get it right was even more beautiful for us who have read Lost and Found Sisters. That's where we met Tilly. Well, a very young Tilly. I had a smile on my face the entire time I read this. But have no fear first time readers, this totally stands on its own. The author jumps from past to present and allows you to get a more in depth picture of just how meant to be these two are :) Overall a very heartwarming well unfolded short story of second chances and HEAs :)Copy provided for blog tour review"}, {"userName": "Cardyn Brooks", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12651474-cardyn-brooks", "userReview": "This little reader's bonbon offers charming updates on Quinn and her husband and the town of Wildstone while Tilly and Dylan speed toward reconciliation ten years after the end of Lost and Found Sisters. My guess is that Rainy Day Friends will pick up where The Good Luck Sister ends. Maybe featuring Dylan's two friends? Elements of their setup feel similar to an earlier, very enjoyable J.S. trilogy about three friends who own a charter plane business.

Unfortunately, this book wasn't for me and I had a little trouble getting into the story. I understood why Dylan left Tilly all those years ago. It wasn't a selfish reason and that made me love him a little bit more. I didn't understand why Tilly didn't trust him even after they got together. He explained his reason and to me they were solid. Another problem I had with her is that she was judge-y when it came to the women he had slept with in the past, but one of the men she was sleeping with in the past was in the same room as them the entire time. It was a little hypocritic, wasn't it? And she went to his place which made me question her. She made my reading experience with this book a little sour and I am removing a whole star for that. She could have been a better person, but in the end, she was the same distrusting woman I met on the first page. I loved Quinn. She was a great character and a lot of fun to have around. I must read her book. If the author decides to write another book in the series I will certainly read it. P.S. Leo stole the spotlight and he was the best part of the book."}, {"userName": "Cheri", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56571595-cheri", "userReview": "We find out what becomes of Tilly and Dylan.

Returning to Wildestone for Tilly, initially feels like she has given up on her dreams but as we all know I am a great believer in everything happens for a reason and The Good Luck Sister proves that\u00a0and then some.\u00a0Dylan\u00a0was Tilly's best friend/first love growing up, they were a source of strength and comfort to each other while they navigated some traumatic events in their youth. Whereas Tilly inherited Quinn, Dylan truly had no-one and nothing to provide a stable foundation on which to build his future. Seeing no other option, Dylan enlisted as soon as he was able leaving everything in Wildestone in the rearview mirror without a backward glance. Although Dylan cared deeply for Tilly, he did not feel worthy of her love and needed to prove to himself that he could become someone he could be proud of. Having never forgotten Tilly, Dylan siezes his chance when Tilly returns to Wildestone to begin the next chapter of her life.\u00a0The chemistry between Dylan and Tilly is electrifying from the\u00a0start but their shared past and painful goodbye acts as a barrier between them, Tilly is afraid to risk her heart again when it took so long to recover from Dylan's departure.\u00a0As Tilly and Dylan spend more time together their connection is quickly re-establish and\u00a0the barriers between them carefully broken down to open the path to an HEA together.\u00a0The Good Luck Sister is a heart-warming story of second chances and finding fulfillment in unexpected places. While Tilly's career\u00a0may not have been what she envisaged it is exactly\u00a0where she should be - her 'calling' if you will :) While Dylan\u00a0has developed into the wonderful man he was always destined to be, the person everyone else saw in him but he had to find for himself."}], "description": "This summer, romance blooms again in Wildstone!After a difficult few years, Tilly Adams is ready for life to start going right.
