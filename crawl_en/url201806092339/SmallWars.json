Both times the effect on me was created by the storyline and the skill of the writer. In The Aviator\u2019s Wife by Melanie Benjamin, I had become so attached to the skilful depiction of Anne Lindburgh that I actually had to put the book aside when the kidnapping occurred. I couldn\u2019t face what was ahead at that point in time. God knows how the real Anne Lindburgh managed.In Small Wars I was unprepared for a shocking scene at the beach. It wasn\u2019t gratuitous. It was essential to the plot of the British involvement in Cyprus in 1956. Clara is married to a dedicated soldier Hal Treherne. His transfer to Cyprus in 1956 is no \u201csunshine posting\u201d. What I really admire in Jones\u2019s writing is her ability to walk that very tricky tightrope of depicting historical events yet sticking closely to her characters\u2019 sensibilities and experiences. In Small Wars there are a lot of incidents that she must negotiate with skill and yet not sound like a history book. For me, this is the author\u2019s greatest achievement, along with (I finally realised at the end of the book) her character study of Hal. Here she is walking the tightrope. As way of explanation, there has been an uprising and the British soldiers have cut loose from authority and been understandably overzealous in places. After a long night they must be rounded up.\u201cIt took hours to mobilise troops and vehicles into order. Truckloads of prisoners were deposited up at Episkopi Garrison guardroom; dozens of others were taken forty miles to the prison camp, Camp K, for questioning. Then, like soldier Pied Pipers, Hal and the other officers drove through the streets, with loud-hailers and whistles, flanked by men with Stens ready, all around Cypriots melted away into their houses, and soldiers, remembering themselves, came out of bars and brothels and people\u2019s homes. Hal found Corporal Trask, in a bar with three others, no barman to be seen, and drunk, helping themselves. He got him and the others out of the smashed-up bar by the scruffs of their necks and tore a strip off Trask, but kept his temper. Being angry with Corporal Trask would be like being angry with one animal in a stampede.\u201dI\u2019ll definitely be reading more books by Sadie Jones. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Bonnie Brody", "userReviewDate": "Feb 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7630898-bonnie-brody", "userReview": "Major Hal Treherne first saw Clara, his friend's sister, when he was 19 and she was 17. The year was 1946. He felt overwhelmed by her and within a few years they were married. Hal came from a family where emotions were not talked about and intimacy was as close to him as a foreign language. He was not prepared for the language of closeness and love that marriage requires. During the first ten years of their marriage Clara and Hal were happy, looking forward to seeing each other, passionate and engaged. Things on the military front were quiet for Hal and this bored him as he was trained for combat. He got his chance to use his combat skills when they were transferred to Cyprus in 1956.Cyprus was a British colony and the British were desperately trying to maintain their last stronghold in the middle east. The colony was fraught with terrorism and warfare as part of their small population was fighting a revolution against Britain and wanting to become part of Greece. Though this was a small war in comparison to major world events, Major Hal Treherne was in his element. He was trained as a warrior and he saw things in shades of black and white. Clara was a good army wife who wanted to prove to Hal that she could cope. As Clara said, \"It makes all the difference in the world to have a wife who doesn't make things harder, don't you think?\" A large part of Hal's job was scouting the villages and the mountains looking for insurgents and terrorists. He was responsible for the searches and for the conduct of his men.Hal begins to see that there is not a clear black and white situation in Cyprus. Young boys who may or may not be guilty are picked up for questioning and are tortured - beaten, water boarded, made to stand in humiliating positions for hours. He is witness to events of horror involving burning flesh and people being blown up. He sees innocent horses step on mines and lose their legs. These sights, sounds, smells, and memories stay with Hal and he is no longer the same person. He can't sleep, the obtrusive thoughts are with him all the time, and he has no way of communicating his feelings to Clara. They pull further apart, victims of a small war in their own home.Hal has a classic case of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder though there was no name for it at that time. He begins to isolate himself, spending long hours in his office away from Clara. When they are together, he is either distant or angry, acting impulsively or not responding to her needs at all. He can't understand her fears and there is no way he can find to talk to her about what she is feeling or what he has experienced.At one point in the book, Hal is told about some heinous actions committed by his men. In his dealings with it, he realizes that the military is more interested in saving their good name than in bringing the criminals to justice. He feels betrayed and disillusioned, angry at the institution that he has idealized since childhood. In a sense, he's lost another war. Instead of valor and pride, he now feels shame and isolation. It no longer feels good to be part of this army that has betrayed its mission and broken Hal's trust. The army, in its stead, looks upon Hal with anger and loathing for having brought to their attention something they would rather not have dealt with.There are several small wars going on in this novel: the British war against Cyprus, the war at home between Hal and Clara, and Hal's personal war with the military once his ideals are shattered. Sadie Jones writes a compelling and fascinating novel of a period in history that is not well-known. She fleshes out her characters with minimal description, relying primarily on dialogue. She does an excellent job with this. The reader 'knows' Hal and Clara and feels empathy and concern for them. We are also able to feel revulsion and disgust towards the criminals and the crimes they commit. This is a novel about war and the toll it takes at home and in the field. Though Ms. Jones refers to these wars as 'small', she tackles big issues of ethics, integrity, shame, betrayal and morality. She shows the reader the field of gray between the black and the white. This is a compelling and intelligent book, one that will keep the reader engrossed from beginning to end.

It's 1956 and Hal has never seen action, so he takes this post eagerly wanting to put in practise everything he's learnt in the base. His wife Clara and their two baby daughters join him in Cyprus after two months and while she struggles to \"fit in\" and make a home out of this foreign place, Hal and his men start their duty searching for suspects and interrogating them trying to prevent more terrorist attacks.As weeks go by, Hal starts to realise that what seemed to be an under control situation is in fact a constant strain between what's morally right and wrong and when he finally dares to speak about it to his superiors he is disappointed in the unfairness of the system and the detached coldness he finds in some of his men.An escalating tension is starting to build up in him, a tension which will affect his relationship with Clara and his daughters, a small war within himself and another one with his family, and a foreboding feeling engulfs the reader as the story advances. This is not a novel to take lightly and Sadie Jones makes an excellent job out of it. Like in her previous novel, The Outcast (which is one of my favourites ever), she manages to create real characters with human conflicts and faults and to portray convincing relationships between them without the need of excessive dialogue. In this book, the images described and the silences tell you all you need to know. No flourishing, no superfluous conversations, just raw feelings and impotence and guilt. And an important message, there are no winners in wars, and no good or bad men, only humans trying to cope with life the best they can and dealing with the consequences of their own actions. Sad, but true.You'll find yourself swallowing compulsively while reading on and wondering how a story like this can have a happy ending.But like life, this book is full of surprises, and not all of them sour.If you're undecided, just pick it up and start reading, you will forget about the rest."}, {"userName": "Gail Cooke", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2809512-gail-cooke", "userReview": "London based author Sadie Jones won us with her critically acclaimed debut novel THE OUTCAST. She was praised for \"her lush writing and tantalizing sense of setting and detail.\" So true, and all of this is at the fore once more with SMALL WARS, a deeply affecting story of love and loyalty.\tWe first meet Hal Treherne as a cadet at a Sandhurst passing-out parade in 1946. As Princess Elizabeth moves down the line during inspection Hal \"knew that she was the embodiment of his country, that he was doing his best to please and that he always would.\"\tAction segues quickly to a volatile Cyprus in 1956. Hal is now a major in the British Army, and has been dispatched here to ferret out terrorists, those who are seeking to unite with Greece. The guerrillas fight with any means - rocks, bombs, ambushes, random shootings, piano wire stretched across roads in the hope of lopping off British heads.\tEarly in his tenure Hal is joined by his wife, Clara, and their young twin daughters, Meg and Lottie. Initially Clara is brave, cheerful, eager to make the best of things while they're in Cyprus. As for Hal, remember how we first met him - he is a moral man, an honorable man, believing that he is serving the greater good. However, the almost daily attacks begin to take their toll on him, and he is appalled, haunted by unexpected violence on the part of his men, raping, torturing.\tHis state of mind, of course, affects Clara who is alone a great deal of the time with their girls in a strange, dangerous place. Their once solid marriage becomes frayed; Clara and Hal driven almost to desperation, each fighting their own private battles.\tSadie Jones has crafted a remarkable story, richly detailed, reminding us of how deeply lives are affected by war.\tHighly recommended.\t- Gail Cooke"}, {"userName": "Ian Mapp", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1598886-ian-mapp", "userReview": "What to do with an author such as Sadie Jones. I found outcast a pleasant enough read.... enough to make me pick up small wars.

There is nothing to dislike - but nothing to really recommend it.And my list of \"authors\" is growing the point that I will never be able to take on new one or keep up with the ones that I have.As with outcast, we combine a sense of time, place, politics and war with a personal story.Hal Treherne is a generational soldier who resents his career being formed at a time when there is no real war.At the start of the book he marries Clara and they are posted to Cyprus where the cypriots are revolting for independance.This is war of the worst type - terrorist attack, counter attacks from the troops and the centre of the book has a shocking attack on the brits met by terrible retribution.Hal is in the middle, as commander, and slowly his marriage distintregrates as he deals with the carnage.The book then moves on for even greater shocks, with the family becoming even more greatly involved.Gently understated, even with its dramatic plot points.

Hal\u2019s idea of war is romanticized as is his idea of marriage. Everything seems so perfect to Hal in the beginning of this conflict. But as the atrocities of war become more realistic and more violent, Hal begins to fade as a patriotic officer. This so called small war has huge consequences on his marriage to Clara. The conflicts it creates as he separates himself from his wife, the disillusionment of war and the complexities of living in a war-torn country are all clearly expressed. As I read this novel, I couldn\u2019t help but think of all the \u201csmall wars\u201d going on around the world and the effect they have on families on both sides of the conflict. Bombings, shootings, torture, rape and bloody fighting are not like they look on the evening news or newspaper accounts. It\u2019s refreshing when Hal walks away from it all, despite the enormous consequences personally and professionally. Many people would not agree with his decision, but the author gives us great insight into Hal's conscience. Sadie Jones captured it so well; the things said in these conflicts and the things that are not said."}, {"userName": "Helen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7359968-helen", "userReview": "I enjoyed Outcast more than this one.

Hal is a major whose main role is supervising the hunt for freedom fighters/terrorists to keep Cyprus stable as a base for operations in the Middle East. He has only ever been a soldier and takes his duties extremely seriously. His wife Clara has to negotiate life as an army wife, looking after her young twin girls, trying not to worry about the intermittent attacks. A series of atrocities are committed by both sides, and Hal finds his conscience conflicting with his duty, putting huge strain on the marriage.Hard to say whether I actually liked this. I knew nothing about Cyprus, so that was interesting. I don't generally like war books, and the awful events portrayed here have done nothing to change that. The characters are hard to relate to, with their stiff-upper-lip British reserve (and I am British!) and the ending was rather flat. I don't regret reading it, but probably wouldn't read another by this author unless the subject really interested me."}, {"userName": "Caroline", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6257531-caroline", "userReview": "This is a story about an honourable and upright soldier called Hal, a major whose recent years have been spent training at Sandhurst followed by a peaceful posting in Germany. We meet him in Cyprus in 1956. Cyprus is far from peaceful. Rather it is rife with dirty warfare. The Greek Cypriot organisation EOKA is determined to overthrow British control of the island \u2013 via shootings, roadside bombs and mines. Snipers pick off British soldiers, a police station is bombed, horses being given their morning exercise are exploded with mines; one of their riders being killed, the other badly wounded. Children throw stones at the soldiers. Throughout the island, the British don\u2019t know who are their friends and who are their enemies, or where the next attack is coming from.Into this climate of mistrust and unpredictable violence comes Clare, Hal\u2019s wife, and their two little twin girls. They have come out from England. Initially Hal and Clare seem shy together but happy.We then meet the British-Greek interpreter Lawrence Davis, who helps the Special Investigations Branch with their interrogations. A classics scholar before he did National Service, we see him depressed and appalled by the often brutal treatments that the SIB meet out to prisoners. Later he is witness to even further British atrocities. These occur after the attack on the horses and their riders. Everyone is badly shaken up by this event and wants retribution. The British soldiers descend upon Limassol, where a poorly organised manoeuvre quickly turns into a party bent on revenge.\u201c(Lieutenant Grieves) acted blindly, barely conscious of himself, but the violence and chaos of the troops, the hot current of vengeance that flowed through them began to flow through him, too. ....He allowed, encouraged, guided what became little more than a riot in places, and as the town began to look like a backdrop for chaos and calamity, so more chaos and calamity were heaped upon it. As Grieves, and others like him, lost their identity, so Limassol lost its identity, too. It wasn\u2019t a town any more, but an assortment of places for beatings and concealment, just hundreds of windows, chairs, news-stands and shelves to be overturned and broken. It was a fast degradation. The outrage of the collective frees the individual to commit terrible acts.\u201dAfter this rampage, Davis turns to Hal, as his senior officer, and tells him of the particular atrocities he saw. Shocked and appalled Hal in turn takes the information to his colonel. But rather than being horrified by what has taken place, the colonel is simply angry that Davis has brought the incident to their attention \u2013 and he and the Special Investigations Branch people work to cover it all up. As far as they are concerned the incident would present the British Army a very bad light - at a time when their presence on the island is already highly unpopular, and the incident must therefore be hushed up.During this time we see Hal retreat further and further into a shell of implacability that he creates for himself. He is appalled by the behaviours that he sees around him, the beating up of prisoners, and now the event in Limassol....and he copes by switching off. His wife tries to reach out to him but he cannot let her get close. She is a conduit to his feelings, and he copes by walling off his feelings. So he keeps his distance.Clara on the other hand reacts in a way that is almost opposite to her husband\u2019s steely denial. She gets hyper sensitive to the dangers on the island ...\u201cShe was hot and panicking and felt imaginary Cypriot eyes upon her. She had started to feel that all the time now. When she was in her bedroom she imagined them watching her house, when she was opening her front door she imagined tripwires across it and had begun to check, without letting anyone see she was doing it. Whenever she got into the car, part of her was expecting it to blow up. Every sound she heard had both a benign and a sinister interpretation, and she would have to remind herself to keep to the real world and not be drawn into her fear completely, not let it overtake her.\u201dAs Hal switches off, Clara switches on.I won\u2019t continue with the plot otherwise I will be giving away further spoilers \u2013 suffice it to say that the rest of the book is a fascinating study of ways of coping under stress, the path followed in an inhibited but loving relationship, and the strains of living with gorilla warfare. The characters of Hal and Clara are wonderfully explored and described, plus there are some other very interesting characters too. The book is beautifully written and also extremely gripping. I couldn\u2019t put it down.The main reason I read this book was because I recently said that books about war bored me, and Jill then recommended that I read this one. She was right to do so.

Although set in Cyprus at the time when the British were keeping order in the late 50s, this backdrop seems to be somewhat underdeveloped. We meet Clara & her husband Hal (Army man) and learn about their lives and the workings of the British army. This was all a bit boring. Then we witness an incident and the book takes a serious turn as it portrays the harsh reality of life under an occupation for the local population. However I became frustrated by the acceptance of such behaviour by the Army. Although I realise at this point, the central character (Hal) begins his mental deterioration, the story shifts from a drama set in war time to being an examination of mental decline. Unfortunately I just didn't enjoy the last 100 or so pages and the story fizzled to nothing. There was a lot of talking and introspective that wasn't done very well.

At the same time, I thought the writing was excellent and I felt like the picture of the British sense of honor and privilege at the tail end of the Empire rang very true.

Meanwhile, Clara is not used to the anxiety that comes with Hal risking his life but finds herself even less prepared for the changes present when her husband does return home. Small Wars is a story which is both political and personal, culminating in a betrayal that Hal and Clara could never have imagined. My initial interest in Small Wars was definitely due to the unusual setting. After falling absolutely in love with The Lotus Eaters by Tatjana Soli, which also involves a love story of foreigners in a new country during a morally messy time, I could only hope that Small Wars would offer the same passionate images. However, the power of Small Wars is not obvious from the first page, it builds slowly throughout the novel, rising subtly until the characters have formed a place in the reader's heart almost without you realizing it. The novel offers a quiet strength, and particularly at first I did not find myself attached to either Hal or Clara, and although by the end I was definitely invested in their fates I never felt like they really broach the distance between reader and character. I often craved an emotional connection with the characters that seemed to be missing. Perhaps this is due to the distance between the characters themselves, as for Hal and Clara most of their journey happens internally and I often couldn't help wishing they would just speak to each other. At times I found the fact that they continued to sweep all issues under the rug and let the distance grow incredibly frustrating; as well as occasionally unbelievable. Hal feels shy of Clara even after knowing her for nearly a decade, and his refusal to discuss what he is feeling has predictably awful consequences. I realize that, in agreement with the time period, Hal was probably trying to protect Clara but it seems to have the opposite effect and I wondered at times if in such a situation both parties would really have said nothing to each other? Jones wants the reader to believe that these two individuals really love each other, but love must be based on some degree of trust, which Clara and Hal seem to lack in each other. I especially wanted more from Clara as a character, as she seemed to suspect something was wrong with Hal but seemed content to keep her resentment a secret to herself. With so much of the story happening inside Clara and Hal's heads, Small Wars unfortunately became slow and difficult to connect with at times.Despite the faults I found with the characters of Small Wars, I did enjoy Jones' writing. Although the entire novel is written in the third person, Jones switches flawlessly from Hal to Clara's narrative and expertly builds to the story's violent climax. Her prose is meticulous and clean, and despite telling a war story full of moral ambiguity Jones does not resort to melodrama or graphic imagery, instead settling on a few powerful incidents. The result is that the reader does not become numb from the violence, and the few times it does occur the images- for example, when Hal is forced to shoot a horse after its front legs have been blown off- are extremely memorable. Ultimately, Small Wars provides well-written insight into not only 1950s Cyprus but the impact of war in general told through characters which unfortunately are difficult to emotionally connect with."}, {"userName": "Wal.li", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7435241-wal-li", "userReview": "UnruheherdMajor Henry Treherne ist mit Leib und Seele Soldat. Er glaubt f\u00fcr Recht und Ordung einzustehen und der guten Sache zu dienen. Nach einigen Jahren der Stationierung in Deutschland und als er mit seiner Einheit im Jahr 1956 nach Zypern verlegt wird, sieht er der Aufgabe freudig entgegen. Seine Frau Clara, die ihn unterst\u00fctzt, folgt ihm kurze Zeit sp\u00e4ter mit den eineinhalb-j\u00e4hrigen Zwillingst\u00f6chtern nach. Doch die Situation in Zypern erweist sich als weniger sonnig als gedacht. Eine griechisch-zypriotische Untergrundorganisation \u00fcberzieht die britischen Kolonialherren mit Anschl\u00e4gen und Gefechten. Henry, nunmehr erstmals mit echten kriegerischen Handlungen konfrontiert, muss miterleben, dass seine Briten dabei nicht immer gut aussehen und ihr Handeln auch nicht so gentlemenlike ist, wie er als ehrenhafter aber unerfahrener Offizier es sich vorgestellt hat. Die inneren Konflikten, die dies bei Henry ausl\u00f6st, bedrohen auch die Beziehung zu seiner Frau.Hier hat sich die Autorin einen im wirklichen Sinne des Wortes einen kleinen Krieg vorgenommen, der sehr aus der Geschichtswirklichkeit und Tagesaktualit\u00e4t verschwunden ist. Die groben Hintergr\u00fcnde lassen sich schnell bei den bekannten Seiten im Internet ermitteln und der Leser kann dabei etwas mehr \u00fcber die Ursachen der Querelen erfahren, die das Leben auf Zypern auch heute zum Teil noch bestimmen, auch wenn man sich um eine Verbesserung der Situation bem\u00fcht.Doch wie bei jedem Krieg, ob klein oder gro\u00df, kommt es zu \u00dcbergriffen der vermeintlich St\u00e4rkeren, von denen man nichts geahnt, die auch v\u00f6llig unerw\u00fcnscht sind. Allerdings wird wie so oft nicht mit einer offenen Aufarbeitung reagiert, sondern mit Vertuschung und Bagatellisierung. Davor ist auch Major Treherne nicht gefeit und er ist in Gefahr, daran zu zerbrechen.Im Zwiespalt zwischen dem ruhigen fast fr\u00f6hlichen Leben der Offiziersclubs und der andauernden Bedrohung auf der Stra\u00dfe, sp\u00fcrt man das Unbehagen und die Nervenanspannung der Soldaten. Mit Widerwillen registriert man wie die Anspannung sich die Bahn bricht und quasi explodiert. Die Autorin versteht es, die Lage so eindringlich zu beschreiben, dass man die Wirkung auf sich selbst sp\u00fcrt. Man fragt sich, ob man mit den Soldaten empfinden muss oder ob man ihr unangemessenes Verhalten streng verurteilen soll. Ein Buch, das Gef\u00fchle hervorruft und zum Nachdenken anregt, das an einen kleinen Krieg erinnert, der \u00fcber die Beteiligten genauso viel Leid gebracht hat wie ein gro\u00dfer. Geschehnisse jedweder Kriege sollten schonungslos beschrieben und vor dem Vergessen bewahrt werden und hierzu leistet die Autorin einen bemerkenswerten Beitrag."}, {"userName": "Sally906", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4949011-sally906", "userReview": "Small wars are military conflicts that are confined to one small country, or area, of the world. By no means are they any less dangerous than large major wars. SMALL WARS is set on the island of Cyprus in the Mediterranean against the background of one such small war in the 1950s. The EOKA terrorists are fighting for independence from Britain and union with Greece. But as Cyprus is considered by Britain to be a vital outpost of the Empire the uprising had to be stopped.Major Hal Treherne is posted to Cyprus and dutifully his wife Clara follows with their twin 16-month old daughters. Hal has risen to the rank of major in a ten year career that has not seen front line action, however he has total commitment to his country and believes in the \u2018rightness\u2019 of their cause - that of protecting Cyprus from the Cypriots. Clara loves her husband, but finds life as a military wife to be lonely and unfulfilling. As the weeks pass Hal is forced to confront his high ideals and question some of the military activities in the face of atrocities that he is drawn into, or made aware of. Internal conflict between what he believes is right and proper and loyalty to the military causes Hal to change. Clara resents the time Hal spends with his job, not just going to the office, but away on patrol for days. Adding this to Hal\u2019s increasing failure to communicate, he is unable to put into words what is happening, Clara starts to believe he cares more for his job than her, a situation that leads to misunderstanding and resentment and a marriage and career on the rocks. When a horrific incident done by the British is hushed up Hal finally loses all faith in the military and questions why it seems alright for the British to torture, but not the enemy. At the same time Clara starts to lose faith in Hal. Can life for the two ever be the same again?SMALL WARS is an easy to read and fast-paced story that makes the reader face up to some very confronting situations while sharing the emotional confusion that Hal goes through. Author, Sadie Jones, has managed to recreate a period of history when people knew their place in society, wives \u2018obeyed\u2019 their husbands and lay back and thought of England, any vestige of an emotional display was frowned upon and a drink at the club was the acceptable form of comfort. Having lived as a child during this time in one such British colonial enclave I found myself really relating to a lot of the social life as it was portrayed."}], "description": "Sadie Jones, the award-winning and internationally bestselling author of The Outcast, returns with an ambitious, richly imagined novel that confirms her place in the literary firmament.A passionate and beautifully written tale of personal loss in the midst of war in late 1950s Cyprus, Small Wars raises important questions that are just as relevant today. What happens when everything a man believes in \u2014 the army, his country, his marriage \u2014 begins to crumble? Hal Treherne is a young British soldier on the brink of a brilliant career. Transferred to Cyprus to defend the colony, Hal takes his wife, Clara, and their daughters with him. But Hal is pulled into atrocities that take him further from Clara, a betrayal that is only one part of a shocking personal crisis to come.
