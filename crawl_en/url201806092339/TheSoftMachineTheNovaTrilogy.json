Now check out this paragraph. \u201dLarval people whispering flesh. Eyes ejaculated spine mud. Black gum in member. Old junky coughing limestone in the obsidian morning: the sale mirror to red sky. Manipulated spasms puppets vestigial meat. Pulsing pink shell. Red pagodas and crystal accounts. Wet dream eyes hanging in lust of dead flesh patios. Boy chrysalis in streets of postcard. Eating birds patrol black lichen. Catatonic sports sear lungs of dream clay. Lust of mud bubble coal gas the insect street. Flesh ejaculation. Penis in the broken mirror rocks of Marwan. Serving the crystal dawn photo of sex. On the Brass and Copper Street.\u201d\nThis book was originally composed using the cut-up technique inspired by the artist Brion Gysin. Let me define cut-up for you: \u201dCut-up is performed by taking a finished and fully linear text and cutting it in pieces with a few or single words on each piece. The resulting pieces are then rearranged into a new text.\u201d So William S. Burroughs wrote a traditional novel and then cut those sentences up into pieces and rearranged them randomly. Maybe less of a creative process than just a random throw of the dice. Burroughs was not happy with the 1961 edition, and in several editions after the original, he continued to make radical changes. It is the type of novel that possibly, because of the randomness of design, can never be finished. He added more standard prose to each new edition to make the book more readable. There is this moment when he writes: \u201dBut then who am I to be critical?\u201d I chuckled because it was as if he were talking to the reader. There is a lot of homosexual sex described, but a lot of it is fairly repetitive. He likes the words jissom (jism) and rectum, and the phrase \u201dragged pants to the ankles.\u201d Did I say there was a lot of sex description? I meant there is oceans, mountains, oodles, gobs, and, forgive my French, a$$loads, (Yes, I\u2019m being tongue in cheek) of sexual situations. There is a linear prose chapter titled The Mayan Caper which gives the reader some idea of what they are actually reading about. If you do decide to take on the task of reading this novel, and you become bogged down, frustrated, discombobulated, or start screaming uncontrollably, please skip ahead to this chapter and soothe your ruffled reader\u2019s soul with at least something you can wrap your mind around. I made notes of some cool passages that I really liked:\u201dAn evil old character with sugary eyes that stuck to you.\u201d\u201cThey were ripe for the plucking forgot way back yonder in the corn hole---Lost in little scraps of delight and burning scrolls.\u201d\u201cThe man opposite me didn\u2019t look like much---A thin grey man in a long coat that flickered like old film.\u201d\u201c...in these times when practically anybody is subject to wander in from the desert with a quit claim deed and snatch a girl\u2019s snatch right out from under her assets.\u201d\u201cWhen the boy peeled off the dry goods he gives off a slow stink like a thawing mummy.\u201d\u201cCrab men peer out of abandoned quarries and shag heaps some sort of vestigial eye growing cheek bone and a look about them as if they could take root and grow on anybody.\u201dEven the linear prose is sometimes as confusing as the cut-up technique sections. Most people probably do not need to read this trilogy, but if you are someone who enjoys looking at words used in unusual ways, or if you are someone who wants to write innovative songs or progressive novels, or if you are someone who thinks that you understand what edgy writing is all about, you probably do need to at least dip a toe into the murky waters of Soft Machine. What will I do? Well, I will read the rest of the series and probably, over time, everything that Burroughs wrote. I save his books for a time when I feel I am becoming stale or too comfortable. Sometimes, I just reach these crustaceous moments when I start to feel like a barnacle attached to the underside of a boat, permanently moored in port. \u201dHuman faces tentative flicker in and out of focus. We waded into the warm mud-water. Hair and ape flesh off in screaming strips. Stood naked human bodies covered with phosphorescent green jelly. Soft tentative flesh cut with ape wounds. Peeling other genitals. Fingers and tongues rubbing off the jelly-cover. Body melting pleasure-sounds in the warm mud. Till the sun went and a blue wind of silence touched human faces and hair. When we came out of the mud we had names.\u201dIf you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit http://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at:https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten"}, {"userName": "Darwin8u", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u", "userReview": "'Breathe in Johnny -- Here Goes --'I respect rather than love it.

It reminds me of those alchemists' experiments when they tried to produce gold from excrements. And failed. Ultimately they were just dabbling in shit.This book reads as if Burroughs swallowed words like rectal mucous, compost heap, jissom, masturbate, cock, dropped his pants. And just threw them up on the page. This is not even a stream of consciousness, or unconsciousness for that matter. When I am completely off my face, haven\u2019t had any sleep for 30 hours, and I\u2019m thinking things just before passing out, I STILL make more sense. There is this piece of advice W.G. Sebald supposedly used to give: \"By all means be experimental, but let the reader be part of the experiment.\" That's where Burroughs fails miserably.Here is a random quote from a random page:\"Corpses hang pants open on the road to Monterrey - clear and loud ahead naked post cards and baby shoes - A man comes back to something he left in underwear peeled the boy warm in 1929 - Thighs slapped the bed jumped ass up - 'Johnny screw' - Cup is split - wastings - Thermodynamics crawls home - game of empty hands - bed pictures post dead question - carrion smell sharp. open in\"It goes like this for six chapters. Nonsense in its purest form. So when chapter seven comes, and all of a sudden paragraphs seem to be organized in an almost coherent manner, you get all excited, even though the plot is still completely bonkers, but alleluia, there IS a plot. Or at least in comparison to the previous six chapters which were written by someone with a serious case of anterograde amnesia, who can only remember the last five words he has written.But then chapter seven ends and it goes right back to gibberish.What am I supposed to get out of this book? There were two sentences I liked (and I used the word \u2018sentence\u2019 loosely as obviously Burroughs has a very particular approach to punctuation). \"Jungle invades the weed grown parks where armadillos infected with the earth eating disease gambol through deserted kiosks and Bolivar in catatonic limestone liberated the area.\"and\"The name is Clem Snide - I am a Private Ass Hole - I will take on any job any identity any body - I will do anything difficult dangerous or downright dirty for a price -\" And the shock factor is non-existent. It\u2019s 2013, you can write all you want about cocks in rectums, on every page even (as Burroughs laboriously did) and I won\u2019t even bat an eye. \"Evening touched our rectums.\"Thank you and goodbye."}, {"userName": "Jason", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4770126-jason", "userReview": "Imagine that the cable box has only 20 channels. Imagine that these channels are playing a variety of sex films, a documentary on parasitic and poisonous insects of the amazon, a sci-fi police drama strangely analogous to Dr. Who (no Daleks, sorry), and a film about junkies. Now imagine what all this would look like when the TV was set to jump randomly among channels every few seconds. This is the best description I can give to the text of The Soft Machine, however this belies the strange almost-coherence contained despite the channel-change static bursts I found myself imagining at every punctuation mark. A time traveling agent attempting to foil religious mind-control, regulate drug usage (among those without proper documentation). The strange religious sacrifices, capital punishment he could fall prey to flicker in and out of the picture. The unnerving presence of the Doctor Benway flickers in and out, much less noticably than in Naked Lunch, but there all the same. The fever dreams of the junk-sick flicker against sexual gratification, boys undressing, the smell of rancid tide flat/rectal mucous.What it means, if anything; I don't know, nor do I really care.

Burroughs between July and November of 2012 and zero in the entirety of 2013 and 2014. What had happened to the young rebel? Had he calmed? Dare we say he made peace with the world?Well, it was a slow realization, but here's the essence of the problem: William S. Burroughs was not a great writer. An interesting one? Definitely. An influential one? I'll go along with that. A key part of shaping my tastes in literature? Oh, you'd better believe it. I'll ride with you as far as saying he was a good one, or at the very least good at writing from a surreal fever pitch. Not to mention his rock-star mystique, his brutal honesty, his de facto status as America's spokesperson for outsiders and weirdos of the world, the sick pleasure I once took in people's disgusted reactions to him and his work... yes, it's easy to see why I was so into this guy at one point.Yet, looking at him two years and a few months out from the height of my Burroughs thing? Dude wasn't a great writer. He just wasn't. He had one great book in him and a couple of good ones, but he was not a great writer, and Soft Machine proves why: after he wrote Naked Lunch, he just never stopped rehashing it. The Wild Boys gives you a bit of a break from it and is probably his second-best novel as a result, but look, I mean, when book after book after book of nightmare drugs and weird sex and centipede attacks just all blend together, and you can put it in space and justify it however you want with the \"he was awfully avant-garde wasn't he,\" but look, if we count the insubstantial parlor trick Dead Fingers Talk, Burroughs went back to the same crazy-ass hallucinations well four consecutive times after Naked Lunch. Four! Maybe even five, depending on what the Last Words of Dutch Schultz is like, maybe even six because the Wild Boys is coming from the same place as well. Nova Express gets a pass out of artistic laziness because it has a unique kinetic energy to it, but otherwise, I just have to wonder why the hell he never did anything else. Unless you count Junky and Queer, which are valuable as insights into repressed and despised communities but aren't wonderful as pieces of writing. I remember thinking as I read this that maybe it was a Naked Lunch rehash, but at the time I brushed it off. Now that realization is back in full force. But hey, I've got Port of Saints and Exterminator! on my shelf right now, and if I know myself, I'll probably read them before this year's out. Burroughs is an invaluable gateway to the postmodern thing, and Naked Lunch can't be denied, but there comes the point where we all must say goodbye to old heroes."}, {"userName": "Rhys", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1138007-rhys", "userReview": "I find the work of William Burroughs fascinating, but I\u2019m not sure I always understand it. In fact, his most experimental books, of which this is a prime example, are utterly incomprehensible from a rationalist, linear perspective. Their meaning seeps in to the subconscious and the reader is left with the feeling that they have almost but not quite grasped some profound set of truths fixed in a story that remains enigmatic, disturbing and genuinely strange.The main conceit behind *The Soft Machine* seems to be that all of us are hosts to mind-parasites that are so well-established we don\u2019t even know they are there, which makes them difficult to oppose or even comprehend properly. Over a long period of time humans have come to accept them as part of their own biology to the extent that we refer to them as our \u2018id\u2019 and \u2018superego\u2019 and assume they are a natural part of our brains. But they aren\u2019t. They are alien outsiders, controlling us.My friend Stuart Ross once epitomised the works of William Burroughs. Pretending to turn the pages of an imaginary Burroughs novel, he made the following running commentary: \u201cHeroin, buggery, heroin, buggery, heroin, buggery, time-travel, heroin, buggery, heroin, time-travel, heroin, buggery\u2026\u201d And that\u2019s a pretty accurate synopsis of *The Soft Machine*. But it\u2019s not the whole story. The whole story is a lot more. I\u2019m still trying to get to grips with it. Perhaps the mind-parasites are preventing me."}, {"userName": "Nikolai", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6343499-nikolai", "userReview": "This book left me perplexed. I\u2019m not sure if I enjoyed it or feel like I wasted my time by reading it. There are flashes of genius, true. Some juxtapositions of words and images were incredibly striking, a few dream-like sequences had to be admired for their sheer creativity, and there were thought-provoking moments throughout. Sometimes the bleakness of the imagery was captivating, sometimes the relentlessness of the prose felt truly exciting, sometimes a bit of satire stuck out of the mix and made me smile. Maybe the entire experience was worthwhile for those good moments. But at times, it was an utter trainwreck, and I found it a bit hard to get through. Which is a shame, because I really wanted to like it.Don\u2019t get me wrong, I often enjoy disjointed, surreal prose. I don\u2019t generally have a problem with \u201cdisturbing\u201d material. And I definitely like books that are described as \u201cstrange.\u201d However, there is something to be said for chaos that is carefully pieced together (or at least well-edited), some semblance of a central plot, and content kept at a tasteful level rather than descending into brazenly adolescent ramblings and shock tactics. That wasn\u2019t the case here. To give some context as to what I consider \"tasteful\" - this is coming from someone who didn\u2019t find American Psycho utterly disgusting and pointless (though I'm not sure I'd call it tasteful, exactly).That\u2019s why I was surprised when I found parts of A Soft Machine hard to swallow. I do wonder if perhaps Burroughs intended it this way. If so, job well done. The level of sexual explicitness, particularly when dropped in between such subjects as giant centipedes and human excrement, rose to the point where it all became not just wholly un-erotic, but downright repulsive. Which is interesting. But also, uh, repulsive. Especially because it was so incredibly repetitive. Like other reviewers have mentioned, I\u2019ve heard enough about jissom and rectal mucous to last a lifetime.There might well be lots of meaning behind the apparent insanity. But it is very effectively disguised, enough so that I didn\u2019t even feel like putting the effort into it, because significant portions of the book could just as well have been written by someone with the IQ of a doorknob, vocabulary aside.This was my first experience with Burroughs, and I realise now this was a bad choice. I\u2019ll certainly give Junkie a try, because stylistically, I found his style quite interesting. It's just content that was... questionable. I also have to admire that he created a novel that actually made me uncomfortable.

There are some enjoyably odd and perverse moments within the text and a number bizarre incidents I can relish, but ultimately I do not think the cut-up experimentation works and serves only to distract from the fact that there isn't much in this book that could be read in a sustained way without being intoxicated.

To say the least, I certainly wasn\u2019t expecting this. One paragraph in, and I\u2019d raised an eyebrow; one page in, and I was starting to wonder if the whole first chapter would be as seemingly nonsensical as what I\u2019d just read. When I found that the second chapter was just as weird, I started to question whether or not it would be worth continuing to read a book that I just didn\u2019t understand, but I persevered after reading the Wikipedia article on it and finding out that some kind of sense emerges from it in chapter 7. There was a strange allure to it, after all, as I\u2019d never read anything quite like it before. Written in the so-called \u201ccut-up and fold-in\u201d technique, the book consists of many different seemingly random, mostly graphic, and often horrific, scenes spliced into one another. Paragraphs go off into a tangent, sentences inexplicably merge into one another, and there\u2019s a general disregard for character, story or even grammar. I must admit, for most of the book, I found it arduous to read and I often came close to throwing in the towel and chucking it in the bin.However, by the time I\u2019d reached chapter 7, the only chapter to have a somewhat coherent plot, and which kind of puts the rest of the book into perspective, I\u2019d gotten my head around the incredibly disjointed writing style, and began to appreciate it for what it was. I say \u201cappreciated\u201d, but that\u2019s purely on an artistic level. By this point, I still didn\u2019t actually *like* the book, although some of the scenes were very funny. I also started to realise that this is a book that you have to read in small doses and really concentrate on. The moment I started reading it just to read it, my mind would wander and I\u2019d lose the intricacies of the narrative (if you can call it that). In small doses, however, I could follow most of it (though many of the rambling sentences and paragraphs still lost me completely, and were probably designed to do so), and I started actually enjoying it.By the end of the book, I had fully gathered the theme (and \u201ctheme\u201d is a better word to use than \u201cstory\u201d when describing the narrative of this book) and understood that this was all some kind of analogy for being hooked on drugs. But, if any further context is needed, Burroughs includes some rather excellent appendices at the back, which I\u2019m guessing he wrote for the book, and they really add to the appeal and understanding. If read as a cohesive end to the novel itself, rather than a separate entity, these appendices make for a rather satisfactory end to this bizarre and challenging book.Over all, I\u2019m glad that I decided to persevere with \u2018The Soft Machine\u2019, and to take my time doing so. Although I hated much of the book before I got my head around it, I think it\u2019s telling that I never once found it pretentious or artistic for the sake of being artistic. William Burroughs is clearly an extremely intelligent and talented writer, and under any lesser author the \u201ccut-up and fold-in\u201d technique would have no doubt been a pretentious nightmare. I can\u2019t imagine myself ever recommending this book to anybody, but I did enjoy it and get a lot from it. It\u2019s certainly forever changed my ideas of what the novel, as a medium, is capable of."}, {"userName": "Evelyn", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4963339-evelyn", "userReview": "Burroughs is one of those writers that usually divides people instantly into the love him or hate him camps, but I'm still undecided about where I belong so I'm sitting in the middle for now.  The Soft Machine is a weird, weird book that features Burroughs' infamous 'cut up' writing style (which again, you'll either love or hate) and dips in and out of sci-fi/fantasy worlds as the characters (who are mostly junkies/rent boys) have random drug-fuelled conversations about life and the universe. The bizarre prose makes it difficult for me to fully follow any kind of actual storyline, but every now and again, the narrators offer up these fascinating titbits of social commentary that are so blunt and forceful, that I found myself agreeing with what they are saying and before I know it, I'm on the last page.

James were a gay heroin addict... okay you get the point.But there are some startling similarities. An affinity for a limited vocabulary, eroticising of stones (sand- for James, lime- for Burroughs)...Neither of the two authors seemed to know anything about sex. Or how human beings normally interact. The flimsy character of one was hung, and the other hung most of his flimsy characters.James taught me that the sight of black men makes you question your wardrobe (page, like... two?). Burroughs, um... well he didn't call them black men...So yeah, I couldn't call which had the greater ability to offend, but I would certainly opt for Burroughs for a more realistic portrayal of a gentleman.Still, I think they both inspired something."}, {"userName": "Phoebe Lynn", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13470310-phoebe-lynn", "userReview": "It is on my shelf \"Sorry I just can't\".Because I just can't.

Surrealist fiction is more or less my favorite but I haaaaated this. The novel seems like it was written by a 16 year old Burroughs trying to piss his parents off by writing about pointlessly angsty shit like fucking Indian boys with deformed boners whilst constantly fire-hosing \"jissom\". Burroughs definitely engraves an image in your mind while you partake but his edginess seems like it is edgy for the sake of being edgy and it wasn't shocking or enjoyable in the slightest sense for me. I'm willing to give Naked Lunch a shot but if it's anything like The Soft Machine, I'm going to do what I did with this book and just instantly give it away."}, {"userName": "Stan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4608453-stan", "userReview": "This book is difficult to rate. Parts of this book are absolutely brilliant. Burroughs is at his satirical best when writing about time travel in the Mayan Caper or the selling of sperm as a commodity in the Gongs of Violence. Other sections he is dark and disturbing when he is writing about addictions and homosexuality. Then there are some sections of the book which feel like indecipherable ranting of junkie nodding in and out of one thought into the next. Burroughs is more of a painter than story teller. Even in his least lucid moment he creates stark harrowing images that will penetrate your subconscious and violate your dreams."}, {"userName": "Misha", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2205814-misha", "userReview": "Three stars because I admired what Burroughs was trying to do with his cut-up technique, but ultimately I found the book unreadable. I think the cut-up technique could work on a story level, but on a sentence level it renders nonsense.
