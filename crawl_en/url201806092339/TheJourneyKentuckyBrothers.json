Branching off of the Fisher family from previous series, she begins a new series focusing on the youngest of the Fisher family, Titus. It was neat learning tidbits about the previous adventures that the family has gone through\u2014makes me want to go and get the other books to read about them in detail! The first chapter was rather humorous as the reader was introduced to Titus, who has a big dislike for cats. As the story continues you can\u2019t help but sympathize with Titus as he tries to deal with his longtime girlfriend breaking up with him. He\u2019s joined the church, but she doesn\u2019t and wants to leave Paradise, thus ending their relationship. He takes this news hard\u2014he\u2019s waited for her since he was 17 years old. Now at 22 going on 23, he\u2019s not sure if he will ever forget the hurt. Desperate to get away from the painful memories, he moves to Kentucky...and meets Suzanne Yoder. I really liked her character. She was strong and determined, and the way she handled many situations was commendable. Her predicament over cooking was rather funny!The Journey was, in some ways, predictable. This didn\u2019t ruin the book for me and I was still pulled into the story, regardless. My hunch was right in the end, but the plot leading up to the ultimate ending was intriguing and kept me reading. Once or twice the writing style was a little vague, especially the scene when the two men barge into Titus\u2019 house. While I still understood what was going on, I didn\u2019t feel \u201cin\u201d the scene\u2026more like someone watching it all from afar. So, besides a few instances like this, the story flowed well and it was easy to get lost in the world of Titus and Suzanne.I have only read one book by Wanda in the past, so don\u2019t have much experience with this author. But I enjoyed this story and would consider getting the next in the series, when it is released. As I mentioned above, The Journey is the beginning of a new series that is a branch off from previous series concerning the Fisher family. I thought this was really neat, continuing the Fisher legacy. I am sure fans of the Fisher\u2019s will be eager to get their hands on this new installment."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4340917-barbara", "userReview": "The Journey is the first book in Wanda Brunstetter\u2019s new series Kentucky Brothers, a spin-off of her Daughters of Lancaster County series. There are always comparisons between siblings in families, but being a twin brings on even more comparisons for Titus Fisher. Titus, a 22 year-old Amish man who still lives with his parents in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, lacks confidence in himself. He feels he is always being compared to Timothy. Titus is courting Phoebe, who has yet to settle down and join the church, much to Titus\u2019 dismay.There are expectations of a young Amish woman \u2013 she should know how to clean, to sew, to cook. But 22 year old Suzanne Yoder would rather be fishing, working with wood, or be outside. Suzanne, single and living with her family in Pembroke, Kentucky, feels she doesn\u2019t need to know how to cook since she\u2019s never had a boyfriend, is probably never getting married, and tells her family she\u2019s alright with that.What happens in order for Titus and Suzanne to meet can only be God\u2019s plan, because Titus\u2019 mamm is concerned that he\u2019s not thinking right. She has no idea why he would want to leave his family and everyone he knows in Pennsylvania to move to Kentucky for a possible job woodworking job for someone he\u2019s never met. The pair gets off to a rocky start \u2013 Titus with his broken heart and Suzanne with her resemblance to Phoebe.I loved this story \u2013 the broken hearts, the family interactions, the community, the misunderstandings, the mystery, the drama, and the reliance on God. I experienced a vast array of emotions while I read \u2013 joy, frustration, fear, relief, pain \u2013 as well as laughing out loud, shedding a few tears, and lots of smiles. I would recommend this novel to anyone who would enjoy inspirational fiction, Amish fiction, or a sweet love story.I received this advance copy of the book from Barbour Publishing through NetGalley and am was not required to provide a positive review.

Silas Fisher is a broken man- the woman that he was so positive that he was set to marry has decided to take off to California as she isn't so sure that this Amish way of life is for her and wants to spread her wings and fly away. Poor Silas is left to lick his wounds and decides a change of scenery might be a good thing. He is presented with a job opportunity that takes him from Paradise , Pennsylvania to the more rural Pembroke Kentucky. Silas starts over with a new job doing woodworking with the Yoder family. Suzanne Yoder, not your typical amish woman also has a love for woodworking. Although her family members can't quite embrace her affinity in that area and so she feels frustrated with her inability to do what she really loves. When these two characters meet at first, they both have a slight aversion to each other- Silas is not fond of Suzanne as her coloring is very similar to the girl who had jilted him and Suzanne wasn't fond of him because Silas wouldn't even meet her eye. Eventually, they see each other for who they really are and the romance between the two is sweet and builds slowly as the story unfolds. I liked the fact that both characters had some growing up to do in this story and that transpires because they both are grounded in their faith and want to do what God wants. One can't help but love the characters and love the families around them that always try to love and support them even if their opinions can sometimes be a little off. They all meant well of course, but sometimes moms worried too much and brothers had their old-fashioned opinions. It just made the characters real and endearing. The Journey is the first in the Kentucky Brother's series and I have to say I'm hooked now and want to see what happens next. I was very fortunate to win this book through the First Reads giveaway program here on Goodreads."}, {"userName": "Denise", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3938000-denise", "userReview": "We meet Titus Fisher a young Amish man who lives in Pennsylvania with his parents. Titus has a twin brother who he compares himself to and falls short in his mind. He has been in love with Phoebe for 5 years and while their parents have not allowed him to court her due to her young age, she has finally turned 18 and an age where they can be together and marry. Pheobe decides she is going to try the ways of the English and go to California with her friend. She wants to have some fun, and refuses to marry or court Titus. Suffering from a broken heart, he moved to Kentucky after and offer of a woodworking job from a family friend. He feels that he needs to be away from the memories of his love and to be able to make it on his own so his parents will stop treating him like a child.  Working for the Yoder family in Kentucky, he meets Suzanne Yoder a 22 year old Amish woman who enjoys woodworking rather than cooking and being inside. He he does not want anything to do with her as she looks just like Pheobe. He starts to court Suzanne's best friend but the sparks don't fly there.Eventually he gets to know Suzanne better and is discovering that she is nothing like Pheobe and that they have a lot of common interests.  This story was very sweet and I just loved Titus and Pheobe. I was a little confused by some of the characters in Lancaster, it seemed that I was missing something and I now realize Wanda E. Brunstetter has many Amish stories out and it seems they are characters from previous books. It did not take away from the story, it just makes me want to pick up some of the previous novels. This was a nice, clean christian book that was a refreshing read."}, {"userName": "Lisa  (Bookworm Lisa)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/864649-lisa-bookworm-lisa", "userReview": "This is the first Amish book that I have read. I admit that I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. I knew that the Amish are a people of great faith and live a simple lifestyle compared to the rest of the world. I was surprised at how much technology they actually use. That the amount allowed is under the direction of the local area religious leaders. I guess I live in a different region of the United States.Titus is the main male character. He has had his heart broken by Pheobe and moves from Pennsylvania to Kentucky. There he begins to forge a life for himself partly to move from all reminders of Pheobe and partly to prove himself and an adult. He meets a couple of eligible young women, but doesn't feel ready to begin courting yet.Suzanne and Ester are best friends. One is interested in Titus at first, but realizes that they have nothing in common. Then the other begins to develop feelings for him. Let's not mention that Phoebe is still hanging around in the picture.I love the faith aspect of the book. I love that this is a clean romance that I would give to my mother in a heartbeat.I am glad that I won it from the first reads program.

Always in the shadow of his perfect twin brother, Timothy, and watched like a little child by his mother, Titus feels it\u2019s time to find where he belongs in the world. And since this offer follows his girlfriend Phoebe\u2019s announcement that she still isn\u2019t ready to join the Amish church, Titus feels that perhaps it would do him some good to be away from the ties he has back home in Pennsylvania. Soon he\u2019s settling into the rhythms of life in Kentucky, despite the dilapidated trailer he lives in and his lack of a buggy, and he strikes up a good friendship with the Yoder family, who are employing him to work in their carpentry shop. But it takes him longer to warm up to Suzanne Yoder, an unconventional young woman who prefers being in the outdoors and woodwork to cooking and sewing. But Suzanne looks just like Phoebe, and Titus can\u2019t help but look of Suzanne and remember how Phoebe broke his heart when she went to explore the English world. Will Titus\u2019s memories of Phoebe put a rift between him and Suzanne, or will he learn to let go of the past and discover what God has planned for him in Kentucky?I will advise that while I tried to start this book with an open mind, I\u2019ve never been a big fan of Wanda Brunstetter. While she\u2019s incredibly popular in the Amish genre, which contains many of my favourite books, I\u2019ve yet to figure out what is so appealing about her books. While many of them contain standard romance plots, I often find her writing stilted and her characters lacking in personality. Despite this, I determined to give her works another try with The Journey, which many of my friends have praised. The plot of this novel, while being fairly predictable, did sound like it had promise, particularly with Suzanne being such an unusual character for an Amish novel. Unfortunately I found it very difficult to enjoy this book. As with previous Brunstetter novels (On Her Own, Plain and Fancy and Kelly\u2019s Chance, to name those that I\u2019ve read) I found the dialogue very stilted and fake-sounding, as were the internal thoughts of many of the characters. This was particularly jarring as the majority of The Journey is dialogue. I would say that at least 80% of this book was dialogue, and while normally I love conversation-driven novels, there was barely any description at all. Books in the Amish genre really need descriptions of the scenery and day-to-day life to make them seem authentic. Sadly, The Journey was very lacking in this department and could really have been set anywhere, if for the occasionally Pennsylvanian Dutch word and mention of a buggy. The Penn Dutch speech was pretty irritating in that whenever a character said anything in Dietsch, another character would then repeat the same sentence back almost word for word so that the reader would understand what the word meant. This sounded incredibly fake, and happened too often for me not to notice. The plot jumped around too much for my liking, leaping back and forth between Titus in Kentucky and his family back home in Pennsylvania, and occasionally over to Phoebe in California. It seemed really unnecessary to include Phoebe\u2019s sections as they really didn\u2019t add much to the plot, other than to show that she wasn\u2019t enjoying herself in the English world. The scenes in Pennsylvania were much the same, and seemed to repeat a lot of what had happened to Titus in Kentucky as word of his new life spread to all of her relatives. More often than not, these sections ended up detracting from the plot rather than adding to it. There were a lot of dramatic events in this book, far too many than is realistic. On several occasions characters are nearly run off the road in their buggies - by a motorbike, a horse and wild dogs - and if these events had been connected I wouldn't have minded, but they weren't! These three events were never given any sort of plausible explanation that linked to the plot, and seemed mainly to function to bring Titus and Suzanne closer together in the aftermath of their experience. The first two events I shrugged off, but I\u2019ll admit that I nearly laughed out loud at the appearance of the feral dogs. There's also a situation surrounding some stolen money which is cleared up far too quickly and easily to be at all believable, and then is never mentioned again by any of the characters. It felt like the author kept trying to insert some sort of mystery into the book but then resolved the situations too fast to actually make the book mysterious. And don't even get me started on all the deaths and tragedies that occurred with this family \u2013 is it really possible for one family to suffer so many traumas? Some of them seemed quite unnecessary, and the way that the characters dealt with them seemed rather offensive to anyone who has lost a relative or a child. I have a few minor complaints about this book which, coupled with my issues with the dialogue, plot-jumping and unrealistic nature of some of the events in this book, ended up taking away from what could have been a fairly enjoyable reading experience. Firstly, The Journey apparently follows on from another series of books as numerous references are made to Zach having being kidnapped as a child. Yet for new readers, this situation isn\u2019t explained very well and left me feeling very confused. There\u2019s nothing in the synopsis to suggest that this series follows another one, so new readers beware of this. I\u2019d also like to caution that while this book is marketed as Christian fiction, the spiritual aspect is very minor. The characters only ever talked to God when they were in dire need of help, but otherwise never mentioned Him, which is particularly unsettling for a novel about the Amish where God is normally central to their community and way of life. There\u2019s a semi-conversion scene towards the end of the novel, which is one of my pet hates in Christian fiction because it is so rarely done in a tactful and satisfying manner. While I did not enjoy this novel, I have read several glowing reviews of it and would encourage potential readers to read those before making a final decision on whether to read The Journey. As much as I hate to write a critical review, this is my honest opinion and I think it necessary to share my views on a book from one of my favourite genres. I\u2019ve read many wonderful new books from this genre that have released this year, and The Journey just doesn\u2019t measure up to novels from newcomers like Kelly Long, Barbara Cameron or Ruth Reid. On a more positive note, fans of Brunstetter will probably enjoy this book as it\u2019s much the same as her earlier novels, but this also means that readers who dislike her work will probably have the same reaction as I did.

I love her work. I am never disappointed in her characters, setting, or issues. Titus moves away to Kentucky to get away from Phoebe. She broke his heart and went off with a friend to California after leading him to believe she would join the church and marry him. Life changed for Titus once he got to Kentucky from day one. He met the granddaughter ( Suzanne ) of the man he was working for and she looked like Phoebe's twin. He was disgusted by her at the beginning. Can she really be just like Phoebe? Then we meet Esther, Suzanne's best friend, Titus really takes a shine to her. Let the romance begin.Wanda has a way of bringing in sorrow and humor together that makes you feel at ease. One minute you feel sorry for Titus on how insecure he is and the next you are laughing when he falls in a pile of manure. Or when he moves into the trailer a friend of his has and it is so messy and vile you would rather sleep outside, to everyone wanting to help him fix it up. I love the romance part of the story it takes off slow and you really wish he will make the right choice. I found myself rooting on one character and feeling sorry for the ex girlfriend in some ways and wanting to slap her silly the next. I also love the innocent humor among the characters. I was laughing out loud through quite a few pages causing stares from some people ( guess they never read a good book ). This was a fun and easy read. If you have reservations of starting a Amish read give some a try I am glad I did."}, {"userName": "Tara", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4081646-tara", "userReview": "With all the anticipation of this living up to my expectations and its fellow Amish romances, I was unfortunately let down. The book is exasperatingly lengthy and almost seems to be written by a non-native English speaker. It takes forever for any real romance to happen and the emotions and insights of the characters are so monotonously explained again and again that any passion is non-existent. The disastrous outcomes of much of the secondary characters was almost laughable in its unreality. The primary male character was unlikeable to say the least while Suzanne the lead female was the only character I really enjoyed. Had it not been an 'Amish' novel, I would have wished for a little more gumption to stand up for herself, but all things considered I felt she had the most real life of any one character. Lastly, the true chaffing occurred in the premise that's repeated over and over that Suzanne's identity and purpose are fragmented by her inability to find a man pleased with her. This is a slap in the face to anyone who prides their self on any little bit of female independence. The prior issues were just ones of plot preference while the travesty of the theme ruined any hope I had for liking this novel."}, {"userName": "Charlene Amsden", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5063701-charlene-amsden", "userReview": "Not the best Amish fiction I have ever read \u2014 not the worst. I finished the book \u2014 read every word cover to cover. I didn\u2019t have to force myself to read. The writing is \u201cinvisible\u201d, which is to stay that Wanda Brunstetter writes so that the story is paramount (as it should be) rather than the prose. The characterization was consistent. The story had a large cast of characters and it was easy to tell them all apart. There were fresh plot elements in this book that I\u2019ve yet to read in any other Amish fiction, including a young Amish woman who wanted to take on a very nontraditional job, and did so successfully.So, why can\u2019t I give The Journey a rave review? Because the problems were over far to quickly and too easily solved. All the plot packages are tied up a little too neatly and a little too sweetly; and a couple scenarios were too far-fetched to be believed. Worse yet, all the emotion in this story is surface. The most my emotions were stirred was when Titus\u2019 mother kept talking to him like he was six years old.

BrunstetterI was graciously given an advanced reader copy of The Journey by NetGalley in exchange for a review. I am under no obligation to write a positive review, just an honest one.The Journey is the first book in Wanda E. Brunstetter's new series, The Kentucky Brothers.If you have read my other Brunstetter reviews, you know she has not been my favorite author. To check out some of those reviews, go here: http://books-camilleelise4.blogspot.c...That being said, I'm going to go ahead and do a 180 turn-around and say that this is, by far, the best Wanda E. Brunstetter I have ever read! Not only was it amazing for being a Brunstetter book, but it was amazing in general.I am genuinely excited about this new series, and cannot wait for the second installment!So, what is The Journey about?The Journey is the story of Titus Fisher, a young Amish man who has loved Phoebe for years though she is several years younger than him. However, though he is baptized into the church, at 18 Phoebe is still not ready to join and instead decides she wants to be in the Englisch world and move to California.Titus finds himself heartbroken and decides that he no longer wants to live in Lancaster where everything and everyone reminds him of Phoebe. He gets an amazing offer to become work in a wood shop for an Amish family in Kentucky, and decides to make the move.Titus arrives in Kentucky and immediately the granddaughter of his employer, Suzanne, reminds him of Phoebe because the two look so similar they could be sisters. Titus takes an immediate disliking to her because of this; after all, he just wants to forget Phoebe and move on. But he is forced to spend time with Phoebe because the woodshop is in the yard of Suzanne's home, and she often brings the men lunch.Suzanne cannot figure out quite why Titus has never taken a liking to her. He rarely looks at her, rarely speaks to her, but her brother and grandfather say that he is a quite talkative man in the woodshop. Suzanne wants nothing more than to work with wood, but she fears the reaction of her brother and father who would probably tell her a woman's place is not in a woodshop, it is in the kitchen. So Suzanne secretly sneaks out to the shop when it is empty to work with the wood.Titus begins to court Suzanne's best friend, but doesn't fully feel the connection between them. And Suzanne finds herself slightly jealous, but figures it is merely because she would like to find a man of her own to court, not because she is interested in Titus.Will Suzanne and Titus ever see eye-to-eye? Will Titus come to appreciate Suzanne as being very different from Phoebe? Is there more in their future than merely awkward hellos and polite conversations? And will Titus' heart ever recover from Phoebe, or is she the one for him?Read The Journey to find out!I thought The Journey was a beautiful story, and having never read another Amish fiction book set in Kentucky, it kept things very interesting. The usual setting is Pennsylvania or Ohio, so that initially made this book unique. We also saw a lot more of the man's perspective as large parts of the book were about Titus' thoughts and feelings.He was relateable because who hasn't suffered a broken heart and wondered if they'll ever recover? Who hasn't suffered a broken heart and just wanted to leave because everything and everyone reminds you of that person? I know having suffered bad heartbreak this past summer, all I wanted to do was have summer end so I could move back to school and be away from all the places my ex and I had gone, and everything that reminded me of him.I just found the book hard to put down, I wanted to keep reading. I was intrigued because the characters were so unique. Hearing an Amish man's thoughts and feelings was so different, and having an Amish woman who wanted to take on what the Amish consider more of a \"man's work\" by working in a woodshop was also unique.My only criticism is one that is fairly common with other Brunstetter books, and that is that there is a character in the book who finds God and finds faith. And it happens in all of about 2 seconds, without my explanation. I just find it so hard to believe that, and much prefer watching someone slowly warm to God because that seems to me, much more likely, how someone comes to find God.I also loved the ending. I won't give it away, but I will say it leaves you wanting more, waiting for the next book, but without being upset the author cut off at such a point. Still, I will be reading the next book in the series, The Healing, (and maybe if I am lucky I can do an advance review!)5 stars!"}], "description": "A New York Times and USA Today Bestseller!\n Discover along with Titus Fisher how life can begin anew in Christian County, Kentucky.
