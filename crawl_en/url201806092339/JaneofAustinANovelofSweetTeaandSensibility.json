But they have each other and that's what counts.I adored this contemporary retelling of Jane Austen's classic Sense & Sensibility that tells the story of the love and losses of three sisters. It grasps the spirit and essentials of the classic while telling a modern story about a large colorful and engaging cast of characters. Jane of Austin splits its narrative with Jane and Callum taking turns telling their separate stories and how the two stories merged. The focus is also split between the story of family and romance.Jane is the middle sister. Between past losses of a mother's early death, a dad's desertion, and her own strong nature, eccentric love for tea and music, she is not good with people, but against the odds she believes and gives love a chance. She spends much of this book growing because she is faced with love and loss, struggles with change, and struggles to understand even those she loves the most. I cheered her on as she came into her own.Callum is a little older and a war-weary veteran Marine with survivor's guilt. He was something of a lone wolf because his dad favored his older brother and his older brother shut him out while betraying Callum's first love. He is just such a beautiful generous, quiet hero-type as he picks up the pieces of his life and attempts to carry on learning that family is not always the one you are born into. He falls for Jane and unselfishly bows out because he sees her interest in someone else, but he protects her and the others anyway. And his Great Dane, just ahhhh, loved seeing this retired service dog find a home, too.The emphasis on the sisters' relationships as they figure out life was a nice extra layer to the contemporary romance. Celia breaks up with a boyfriend and quietly struggles even while working to reset her life in Austin, Margot is a senior in high school and must adjust from the move from San Francisco to Austin, and then Jane who wonders if they will ever find home and keep their sisterly closeness.The writing was lovely and I enjoyed getting all those song references and the recipes at the end of each chapter. Foodies and tea aficionados will find this book satisfying.All in all, it was a sumptuous and engaging, gentle and sweet story of love, life and family.I received this book from Net Galley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17442587-hannah", "userReview": "2.5 starsI read the first chapter online and expected to love it. I'm nuts about hot teas, and loved the whole tea-shop aspect. However, in the end, it fell flat. It's published by a Christian publisher, but not billed as such in the summary; thus, the sole reference to faith is that one character wishes to go to seminary and start a church plant; the MC, Jane, doesn't even ask if the dashing man who comes to their rescue is a believer or not, which obviously should be one of the first things a Christian girl should ask a man who asks her out.I liked the sister parts, though after the fun of the trip, the plot itself seemed to lose focus. I expected it to be more concerned with the tea shop part, but it wasn't. The recipes were also a fun part, though the tip about \"not using boiling water\" doesn't apply to black tea...for teas like Assam, you want to bring it just to the boil and then use the water. Also, her \"tea farm\" of tea plants was unrealistic; she has enough plants to fill the back of a pickup truck bed, which might be enough to supply one tea drinker's moderate habit, but definitely nowhere near enough to support an online business or a tea shop.What dropped it below three stars for me was two instances of potty humor and one gay reference (\"their clientele in CA was women and gay men\")...as a gal in a tea-shop-attending family with regular guys, it's quite insulting to think that the only guys who use tea rooms are gay. I actually know a young military man who takes his buddies to tea shop outings because they discovered the best sweets are there. I don't know if I was more offended by a gay reference by a Christian writer, or by the stereotype about men.Thanks to Blogging for Books for my free review copy."}, {"userName": "Emilee", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11072558-emilee", "userReview": "This book took me a little longer to get into.

And while I enjoy all of Austen's novels, Sense & Sensibility is not my favorite. It doesn't even make my top three. And I say all of this, because I adored the HELL out of this adaptation of just that book.It was just so charming! The sister fight felt so real, as did the falling for someone terrible and charming because you're in a new place where you don't know anyone, and Callum!!! Callum is such a great hero. And this book made me hungry and it comes with recipes and it made me want to find a monthly tea subscription box, so really, it achieved all its secondary objectives in addition to just being great.Really glad I got this. It made me smile a lot.(Side note: how gorgeous is that cover?

As a Jane Austen fan, one of her books I like least is a favorite of many. There\u2019s just something about Sense and Sensibility that has always bothered me. Maybe it\u2019s because Marianne Dashwood seems more flighty that heart-on-her sleeve to me, or that Elinor and Edward spend so little time together that I never get the feel for their relationship.Whatever it is, I\u2019m happy that there have been some adaptation of the original story that I have enjoyed reading. And Hillary Manton Lodge\u2019s contemporary take on this classic tale is delightful and engaging.The cast of characters in Jane of Austin: A Novel of Sweet Tea and Sensibility create an ensemble that welcomes you in. Told from the perspective of the middle sister (Jane in this book, Marianne Dashwood in the original) gives readers a fresh perspective. The focus on the dynamics between the sisters adds depth to the novel, and the additional stress of a major move adds to the tension.Moments of heartache and heartbreak are woven with touches of humor when the reader needs it most. Throw in an elderly in-law who speaks her mind; a rescue dog you can\u2019t help but love; references to popular movies, music, and television, and you have a recipe for success.Speaking of recipes, there are some yummy ones included in this book for the motivated baker to try.Through Jane\u2019s and retired army major, Callum Beckett\u2019s eyes, readers get a more in-depth, deeper love story than the original (in my opinion). I think Jane Austen would approve.This is one of those books that deserves multiple readings. At least it will get more than one from me!I receive complimentary books for review from publishers, publicists, and/or authors, including NetGalley. I am not required to write positive reviews.

And while I\u2019ve never read the classic, I found this novel enjoyable as the sisters learn to adjust to life changes and new surroundings. I loved how tea was infused in this novel and was such a natural extension of who the girls were. It wasn\u2019t just a business their lives revolve around, but it holds a special place in their hearts. I mean, Jane carries tea around in her purse, so it is definitely more than a business!And I wouldn\u2019t mind visiting Texas one day for the big porches, sweet tea, and barbecue. Sounds like my kind of place!Can I just mention the adorable big dog, Dash?

Fans will appreciate the homage, and those unfamiliar with the story will also thoroughly enjoy it as well. Likable characters, dastardly villains and fascinating information about tea and recipes, this book is everything Lodge's readers have come to expect from her delightful novels.Jane Woodward and her sister Celia opened a tea salon in San Francisco in order to continue raising their sister Margot after their father's questionable business practices came to light and he fled the country. Now their building is being sold and they only have a short time to find a new suitable location. Out of options, the sisters choose to move to Austin, Texas, where they have relatives with room for them to live while they get back on their feet. Nothing seems to go as planned, yet Jane does meet a wonderful man right away and begins to fall in love. Then why does she feel such a connection to Ben, their cousin's friend who is home recovering from a war injury?

Celia, the elder sister, is very much like Elinor, though Jane is not at all like Marianne in that she doesn\u2019t like or trust sentiment, and even when she falls head over heels in love with Sean (the Willoughby character) she still isn\u2019t into hearts and flowers talk.The author gets rid of the mother altogether, and keeps the father alive but strictly off-scene, living abroad after being caught in financial scams. He pretty much abandoned his daughters, who band together tightly, at first opening a tea shop in San Francisco, and when the owner\u2019s heirs boot them out (these are the Fanny and John Dashwood characters), they move to Austin, Texas, where a cousin has offered them a guest house as they try to recoup to start all over again.They meet Sean on the road, and he comes to the rescue, settling us into the familiar plot as we get to meet Ian, the genuinely nice cousin who is the Sir John Middleton character, and his prickly, cold wife Mariah, and Nina, Mariah\u2019s warm, friendly mother.Things I enjoyed: the relationship between the sisters. Even when Celia wasn\u2019t talking to Jane they still stuck by each other, and Margot, the teen, was particularly well done. My favorite was Callum Beckett, who was recently discharged after a devastating incident in which he lost a leg; he woke up to discover his father had died, and he was now expected to take over the family business.Sean, the Willoughby character, is a rock star, an interesting choice. I also really liked the tea shop aspect, as Jane gets into baking sweets and mixing teas. Things that didn\u2019t work as well: the Steele sisters were conflated into one, Lyndsay, who is introduced promisingly, but pretty much vanishes except to be reported on as the plot needs. Too bad\u2014Lucy Steele\u2019s sharp eyes, and her sister\u2019s ridiculousness, are some of my favorite passages in S&S, and we didn\u2019t get any of the household upset when Nancy Steele admits to the Dashwoods that Lucy is engaged to Edward. Nor do we see the tough position that Lyndsay/Lucy puts Celia/Elinor in with her \u2018relationship\u2019 with Teddy/Edward. The scene between the sisters when Celia tells Jane what she\u2019s been hiding has little impact, unlike the similar scene in S&S when Marianne begins to understand that yes, Elinor feels too, she keeps it inside while watching out for everyone else, unlike Marianne, who expects the world to fall in with her emotional excesses.The Dashwood replacements pretty much disappear, too, except for off-stage mentions that serve the plot.Teddy is the Edward character, and he\u2019s equally wishy-washy, bringing me to the next observation. The book was published by a Christian house, but I wonder if the story was edited for a mainstream audience. Teddy does opt for seminary at the end, and Ian quietly says grace before meals, but otherwise there isn\u2019t any faith or church-going in sight\u2014nor is there on-stage sex. (There is still the subplot about the unfortunate girl ruined by Willoughby/Sean and rescued by the Colonel/Callum, which was pretty well handled.) So the story doesn\u2019t quite fit either model, but floats somewhere in between, which sometimes make it feel slightly out of focus, though Austen\u2019s plot pulls the events steadily along.Overall it was an entertaining, fast read, ending with smiles all around.Copy provided by publisher"}, {"userName": "Natalie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47265779-natalie", "userReview": "Sense and Sensibility is probably my favorite Jane Austen book, and though being a modern retelling this DEFINITELY doesn't measure up....it was still really really good.

I\u2019m going to take a few breaths and collect my thoughts before I dive into this review, because I want to do it right. So first I\u2019ll tell you a little on what the story is about.Three sisters have to deal with the repercussions of their businessman father\u2019s major scandal, but they manage to make the best of the situation by creating a business of their own\u2013a cute tea shop in San Francisco. Years late when their landlord passes away, his nephew forces them out of their beloved shop. Needing a fresh start, Jane, Celia and Margot find themselves staying with a distant cousin from their late mother\u2019s side and starting over\u2026in Austin, Texas. Thus begins an adventure of a lifetime for the three girls, one that involves both heartbreak and beautiful love.A story steeped in romance, sisterly love, and a passion for tea\u2013Jane of Austin had me in tears, sometimes in laughter and other times from all the feels. I want more! There are a million things to love about this book, one of them being the charming and witty characters. Even the side characters were a delight! Jane was quirky and cute and her affinity for baking made her downright lovable. Her relationship with her sisters was incredibly sweet and the communication issues that arose between her and Celia were relatable and raw. Each sister\u2019s separate approaches to moving and life in general was incredibly well done and realistic, which leads me to the writing. This author has quickly become a favorite of mine. Everything from the beautiful writing style to the chapter-ending recipes made me love this story all the more. It was like all of my favorite things in one story! Warning\u2013you will be hungry during and after reading this. Be prepared and make some scones beforehand. \ud83d\ude09 Let\u2019s not forget the delicious romance either. Two words\u2013Callum. Beckett. If there is a more swoon-worthy hero in a contemporary romance novel, I\u2019d like to know, because Callum was downright perfect. The slow relationship that develops between him and Jane had that intangible thing that just tugged at my heartstrings. Can one say the words perfect and love too many times in a book review?! Because I feel like I\u2019m approaching that line.Jane of Austin is a must-read for both Austen and contemporary romance lovers alike. I hope I did this book justice with my review, because it is one of those reads that\u2019ll stick with me. I\u2019ll say it again, I loved this book. Go read it! It\u2019s perfect for summer, reading along with friends, or bringing on vacation.

Fans of Jane Austen-esque novels, look no further! A retelling of Sense and Sensibility, this book was fun, sweet, bitter, and beautiful.It's a contemporary, retelling a Regency tale of romance, heartache, and finding true love. I liked the sisters, Celia, Jane, and Margot. And it was fun getting it from Jane's (a.k.a. Marianne's) point of view. Truly, this was such a charming retelling of the beloved, classic tale, I didn't mind that it was set in modern days. It was neat to explore Texas. *smiles* The descriptions were lovely and the book, all around, had an old-fashioned feel. The aspect of teas and tea-making, baking and tea shops? I loved it! So, so fun and unique.The characters were all great. But Callum was my favorite. I just really, really liked him. A war hero. A gentleman. A good man. Plus, his dog was just the best. This may be the only time I've so loved a dog in a book! ^_^ *hugs Dash*A couple complaints. Well, it is contemporary ... and that probably means the romance isn't quite to my liking. Yes. Too much kissing, too fast. Way too much \"dating without any intentions of marriage anytime soon\". There was more intention and marriage-mindedness with Callum, but still the \"making out\" came way too soon. Save it for marriage, alright, folks?Also, I thought this book was Christian fiction. There was no talk of faith except for one character's decision to go to seminary school. All in all, it was clean and old-fashioned, (like the Jane Austen movies) even with good morals and lessons, for the most part. So, of course I would have rather had a faith theme, but Jane of Austin was still a lovely read ... like watching a Jane Austen movie!It was easy to read, interesting, different yet similar to the original Sense and Sensibility, and overall an enjoyable read.I received a copy of Jane of Austin from BloggingforBooks in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Rissi", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16024231-rissi", "userReview": "\u201cSmart, sassy and sensational, Jane of Austin is a classic in its own right; a book worthy of placing next to its Austen inspired tome.\u201dChange is threatening to sweep the Woodward sister\u2019s into its vicious cycle. In the wake of their father\u2019s scandal, the sisters reinvent their life by opening a tea shop. Now, their landlord has died and his family no longer believe they\u2019re good tenants. Forced to leave behind their home and business, the three sisters pack up and make the move from California to Texas, where distant relatives await.Jane is the most impetuous of the three whereas Celia is the voice of reason and then there\u2019s Margot. A high school senior, Margot has had plenty of change in her life, but she also settles into their new life with little fuss. You see Jane detests the idea of leaving their home (and wonders at the real reason for it), while Celia has just had her heart broken by the man she thought was \u201cthe one.\u201d As the sisters navigate their new life, they must learn how to adapt to change, new friends, broken hearts and possibilities.Reading this book was a unique experience. Not only did I have a read along with a fellow book blogger (#BookBesties), my primary reading medium was also unusual. Part of this experience included the audio book. Time and again I\u2019ve said I wouldn\u2019t like audio books, but as I was participating in a read along, I wanted a way (if needed) to continue to \u201cread\u201d this book even when the day didn\u2019t allow for normal reading time. Walking away from this experience was, I\u2019m happy to report, a very good one. (As an aside, the audio is fantastic; the female narrator gives each character a little different \u201cvoice,\u201d and Margot in particular is a spot-on interpretation.) Mixing the traditional \u201cold fashioned\u201d way of reading (print book) with audio enhanced the experience, and if you\u2019re wondering what I thought of Jane of Austin, let\u2019s talk about it.It\u2019s been weeks since reading this book, and still I didn\u2019t sit down to pen a review. Why? It\u2019s one of those books that impacts its reader (because it\u2019s so classy) and stays with its reader long after the final page. These kind of novels are impossible to accurately put into words. The sisters are each well written, and each personality reads a little differently than the other. This is a book that\u2019s memorable in all the right ways. Though contemporized and brought into the 21st century, Jane of Austin retells Sense & Sensibility really well. Of course, Hillary had to adjust some of the key elements because what was relevant in Austen\u2019s world is no longer a barrier in ours. All are changes that work in the flow without sacrificing the heart of this story.Each of the personalities is well represented. Jane (Marianne) is as one would expect a contemporary Marianne to be, only her \u201cpassionate\u201d emotions are tamed, which I appreciated. Though some parts of her original character being carried over into this story really surprised me, each are handled well. Celia is, unfortunately, pushed to the background because of the first-person POV switch off (between Jane and a male character, Callum), but what\u2019s there is very like Elinor. Margot (Margaret) is perhaps the funniest character in the entire novel, though all of the eccentric characters we know from Sense & Sensibility are present.\u201cI didn't respond on account of having a severe case of the heart flutters.\u201d - Hillary Manton LodgeReading this novel is like the warm, welcoming smell of freshly baked cookies (perfect since this book continues Hillary\u2019s signature addition of recipes) or the enveloping comfort of a favorite sweater. It\u2019s full of beautiful quotes, and lovely characters. The bond of sisterhood is depicted as genuine with bumps and bruises, and the journey towards love is full of heartbreak and swoony smiles. If there is a flaw I have with the book, it\u2019s that we don\u2019t see enough of the girl\u2019s with their loves. I understand the \u201cwhy,\u201d I just wish we\u2019d had more page time with them, and furthermore, that this book hadn\u2019t ended. A reader can appreciate the simple and quiet moments that bond two characters (saying who would be all about the spoilers!), but again, because these characters are so dynamic, they\u2019re missed when it\u2019s time to say goodbye.Smart, sassy and sensational, Jane of Austin is a classic in its own right; a book worthy of placing next to its Austen inspired tome.\u2665Sincere thanks to the publisher for providing a complimentary copy of this book."}, {"userName": "steph ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5679327-steph", "userReview": "Loved it.

I feel the need to disclose that I do not attain to such fandom. However, I have read and enjoyed most of her books, Sense and Sensibility among them. In my basic familiarity with the original I was able to make a few direct connections to Lodge\u2019s work. For instance, I fully expected Sean Willis to be a cad and Jane to eventually turn her affections towards Callum. The author retains enough elements of Austen\u2019s work to label her novel a re-telling while creating a totally modern, relatable, and witty story of her own. Though romance is not my go-to genre, I loved the \u201cfall, heartbreak, and knight in shining armor\u201d type rescue in this book.I count Jane of Austin as my introduction to Hillary Manton Lodge and I\u2019m impressed. Her dialogue drew me into each conversation as if I were standing in the room. She also does a beautiful job of assigning her characters distinct personalities. While I\u2019ve met people who are as calm and collected as Celia, I identified more closely with Jane\u2019s focused, loyal, sarcastic, occasionally irritable, and totally introverted ways. She made me laugh! Furthermore, the book is peppered with recipes I am eager to try. Read eager as we drove to three grocery stores searching for frozen cranberries\u2014eager.It\u2019s interesting to note that in a book labeled contemporary Christian by its publisher, you won\u2019t read about these sisters going to church, praying through a crisis, or surrendering their lives to Jesus. Instead, you\u2019ll find a fairly chaste romance and a story that celebrates the bond of sisterhood.

I've never even read Sense and Sensibility (on which this book is apparently based). But I loved Jane of Austin. Celia, Jane, and Margot Woodward have faced a lot of tragedy in their young lives. After their mother dies in a car accident, their father is fired from his position in finance due to some questionable choices - choices that leave him on the run and his daughters on their own. Armed with a trust fund left behind by their mother, the girls start a tea salon in their beloved San Francisco. But when new owners demand more in rent than the girls can pay, they're forced to pack up their tea plants and move. Eventually, they settle with family in Austin, Texas where new adventures await.I greatly enjoyed this story. I loved the dynamic between the sisters, the love triangle element, and the humorous witticisms sprinkled throughout. The storyline was interesting and moved along well. The end was semi-cheesy, but I like a little cheese now and then. :-)This was another one of those strange books that I think is probably classified as inspirational fiction, and is very clean, but makes almost no mention of God.(I received an advance copy of this book via Bloggingforbooks.com in exchange for an honest review.)"}, {"userName": "Cathy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1478426-cathy", "userReview": "I read this in one sitting. I started reading and just didn't stop until I'd finished. I think I got up to pee. Once. I've only read Sense and Sensibility once, about 16 years ago I'd say, so the details of that novel have slipped my mind. It was never my favourite Austen (of the ones I've read) but I do remember liking it and always having some vague plan to reread it soon. I adored the 1995 movie version of the book, because Emma Thompson. So I read this without really comparing it to the original, but it's such a good modern version regardless! Even if you've never read Sense and Sensibility, or seen the movie or even know the basics of the story, it's just a really sweet and charming book with great characters. I liked Jane a lot more than I liked Marianne in the original novel, is basically the only comparison I could make. Plus, Callum is the best hero and I wish all the books could be about him.

So they start a tea shop that does very well for years, until the new landlord of their shop ups their payment to higher than they can afford. With nowhere else to go, the sisters decide to start over in Austin, Texas with the help of their mother's cousin.As you may have guessed from the title - Jane of Austin: A Novel of Sweet Tea and Sensibility - this book is a modern retelling of Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility. Of course the author HAD to put them in Austin, Texas, to make the pun. But I still like the title, and the cover is absolutely stunning. Jane, the younger sister, is the main character. She is a lovable individual, snarky and sarcastic but passionate and deep. She and her love interests - the overlooked ex-soldier and the chivalrous Texan - take center stage. They are well-developed and enjoyable to read about. Several of the others seemed like static characters, and their personalities were played up to make them quite humorous. A few of them could have used more depth, and yet, adding depth to some would have taken away the lightheartedness of the tone. I can't say much about the plot. It is a retelling of a classic! I loved the original, and I love this modernized version. As a note, in between many of the chapters there are recipes for whatever food or drink was served within the previous chapter. Tea is a major theme is the book and shows up frequently in recipe form. I haven't tried any of the recipes yet, so I can't speak on how good they are, but I love the idea of tasting what the characters taste. It adds one more of the five senses into the story.

While there is a river in Austin, the Colorado River, it is called Lady Bird Lake or Town Lake by locals. The novel mentions driving through Buda on I-35 just before approaching Austin. Coming from Roswell, it's more plausible that the travelers would be coming into the north side of Austin (Buda is south of Austin).Texas specifics...if you haven't had a fruit kolache or breakfast taco, I highly recommend them both.A huge thank you to Beth B for sharing this book with me.

Few have succeeded. I wanted a break from fantasy and thrillers. So, when I saw this book on Netgalley, I requested an ARC with great curiosity. The book was a delight. I am grateful to Netgalley and WaterBrook & Multnomah for approving a free e-copy in exchange for an honest review.Jane of Austin: A Novel of Sweet Tea and Sensibility by Hillary Manton Lodge is an adaptation of the English literary figure Jane Austen\u2019s novel Sense and Sensibility.Three sisters live in modern day America, have ambitions and aspirations like any modern women. Their wealthy father gets into legal troubles and the sisters lose their life of privilege, standing a test of time and will. They do not break. Instead, they take matters into their own sensible hands and start their very own tea business. The eldest one deals with unemployment, younger one with a sudden and drastic change in her situation, and the second sister forms the bridge between the two phases of life. Eventually, the sisters move to Austin, Texas, upon receiving an enthusiastic response from their deceased mother\u2019s cousin. Life beings here on a different note. A small guest house in a property owned by the wealthy cousin, his slightly cold, elegant, but not a villainous wife, and a loud, warm, and as you find out later, a kind mother-in-law, welcome Celia, Jane, and Margot (in the order of age), the Woodward sisters.Doubt and concern for the much-anticipated tea shop in Texas plague the sisters\u2019 minds as they can\u2019t find a suitable place soon enough. Meanwhile, Jane finds and loses love, Celia witnesses nearly unrequited love as she suffers from her own abruptly ended (for her sisters and us, readers) relationship, Margot fears the uncertainty of future. Their father\u2019s transgressions continue shadowing their thoughts and ambitions. Friends and not-so-well-wishers from past come back to haunt the present.What happens next? Read the book.I have enjoyed Jane Austen\u2019s novels. If not the biggest fan ever, I do appreciate the use of irony in her prose, her wit in creating characters contrasting each other in a book showing us the huge difference in the then society hierarchy, the perceptions of one\u2019s wealth and worth (have we changed much?) and moralities, senses, and sensibilities.Hillary Manton Lodge\u2019s work shows the similar perceptions existing in the minds of those treading in the different levels of a current and relatable society. She has taken Jane Austen\u2019s already created characters who exemplify the said levels (yes, even now) and set them into a world of her own imagination and experience, hence created an excellent blend of classic and modern feel in her book, not unlike the tea her protagonist Jane brews.Lodge didn\u2019t blindly copy the characters. Her Jane is way more sensible and responsible, hence admirable, compared to the Marianne from Sense and Sensibility. She takes a larger part in accepting and adapting to the changes the Woodwards go through, compared to Marianne. Jane Austen\u2019s work reflects a society of her time. Modern women like us find it difficult to imagine the greatest crisis in a book is the reduction in the number of servants or four people living in only four bedrooms. Lodge has brought the scale much towards current reality by introducing the father\u2019s tax evasion and absence of a mother, showing the young protagonists as strong, independent young women, not waiting for someone to help them out of their dilemma and spending their days painting and singing and playing the piano. Lodge\u2019s Woodward sisters have trust funds, do all the aforementioned delicate lady-like things appreciable in marriageable young women, and work hard to establish their business mostly on their own.The characters are well-rounded. Callum, Celia, Nina, make other significant examples who stand out.The plot is pretty good with crisis appearing in comfortable intervals keeping a decent pace. Lodge shows more than she tells, giving us a detailed insight into the sisters\u2019 lives and their surroundings without being tedious.My favourite parts are wherever Lodge talks about Tea. Growing, storing, blending, brewing. That\u2019s the originality she has brought into her book, the quotations and recipes, besides the well-transformed characters who form the skeleton around which the story fleshes out. I think of the novel as of two parts: Tea shop in San Francisco and Tea shop in Texas. The recipes were interesting but alas, I don\u2019t bake, nor am I a tea enthusiast.Time to whine. I should have expected the little formulaic round up of all relationships but didn\u2019t. Jane Woodward\u2019s analysis of some supporting character in her mind, their eccentricities, virtues, justifying their good and bad actions, were a little heavy on the telling. I don\u2019t know if those parts were meant to show Jane\u2019s goodness in believing everybody is good and justifiable or that nobody is at fault. The father\u2019s act was the only one not attempted at justification.While there was pretty appreciable humour in the narrative, Jane Austen\u2019s classic wit and irony in using her characters to portray her time and society were missing. Jane Austen\u2019s subtle mockery of her time, when women\u2019s future hung from the marriage ring, didn\u2019t find a smooth transition into a modern version. Lodge\u2019s version is a romance. It does not serve as a social satire. If you like romance you will enjoy this book. Do not look for Jane Austen here. You will appreciate the retelling better.3.5 bohostars"}, {"userName": "Callie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7314089-callie", "userReview": "As you probably saw on my list of books I brought on vacation, I have dipped my toes back into Jane Austen novels again this summer. I have also read other books that I enjoyed by Hillary Manton Lodge, so when I saw that she had written a modern retelling of Sense And Sensibility, it was just meant to be!In Jane Of Austin, Jane and her sisters lose all their respectability when their father is accused of a financial crime - since they can no longer work in the financial world, they decide to open a tea parlor. However, when their landlord dies they are kicked out of their tea shop's rental space, and decide to start over again in Austin.First, I'll say that whenever I see that a novel has been published by a Christian publishing company, I expect some sort of Christian element to it, even if it's slight. However, this book really had zero spiritual references at all, and I wouldn't consider it a Christian book. So going forward with this review, I'm approaching it as a secular novel.Content: The only objections I had to the content were some sexual implications. One of the characters speculates on whether a couple of the main characters may have moved in together (they didn't). One of the characters suggestively says that Jane should \"come back to his place\" (she doesn't). And there is a lot of making out. These things would have bothered me more if I had been thinking this was supposed to be a Christian book, but like I said, I figured out pretty quickly that it wasn't. However, considering it is coming from a Christian publisher, I think it's just a good example of why we shouldn't necessarily trust \"Christian books\" to never present questionable morals.Characters: The story is told from the perspective of the \"Maryanne\" and \"Colonel Branden\" characters in this book, which I was excited about when I began reading. Their love story is my favorite one in Sense And Sensibility, and I was excited to see how the book would play out from this perspective. However, I have to say, Jane (\"Maryanne\") just really wasn't working for me. I liked her character well enough, but she just seemed too Type A to be really \"Maryanne-ish\" to me. My picture of Maryanne is that she is this free-spirited, creative type; and while Jane was creative, she was like snooty-type-A creative. Lodge tried to make her passionate and emotional, but I felt like those emotions didn't seem to fit as well on the character of Jane because I saw her as more logical/Type A. It just didn't jive with my vision of who Maryanne was. That's just my personal opinion, others will probably disagree with me here!My Thoughts: I really enjoyed the way Lodge managed to incorporate all the elements of the story of Sense And Sensibility into this book! She did a really good job, and I found myself remembering different parts of the original story as I read.I thought the tea shop aspect of it was particularly fun, and Lodge includes a lot of recipes for some of the foods mentioned in the book. She did this in her other books too, and just from the writing it is obvious the author knows what she is talking about culinarily. I just loved the extra coziness all the recipes add to Lodge's novels, and her food descriptions made me hungry.If you'd like to read a Jane Austen retelling, this one was a fun, clean one, and I'd recommend it overall!Note: I received a copy of this book for free from the publisher in exchange for a review. This is my honest opinion."}, {"userName": "Ash \u2020Reviews of a FearStreetZombie\u2020", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28576491-ash-reviews-of-a-fearstreetzombie", "userReview": "I admit, I have never read a Jane Austin book before. I have a few, but never read them because I am looking for something to give me a bit of a push into reading them. Jane of Austin started out promising and then a little less than half way though, flopped. It went from being unique to being just like every single other Contemporary book out there. Girl in trouble. Guy saves girl. Enter guy two. Que up love triangles and insta-loves. So on and so on.This book started out okay but then it just flopped in the worst way. The insta-loves were ridiculous. and it just dragged on and on and on about Texas. The constant non-stop Texas this and Texas that and I'm from Texas so I am better. Blah blah blah was overly annoying. I get everyone is like that because they are proud of where they come from but if they go on and on about How awesome they are because they are *insert state* - run. Run as fast as you can AWAY. Because they are anything but \"good\". LolI can't get over the insta-loves though. Just....are you freaking serious? I thought Jane was suppose to be this sensible adult. *snorts* No. Just no. She acts like a 14 year old. Guy: I love youJane: *fluttery*Guy: Marry meIt's been what? two weeks? if even that? Imagine the horrible example she is setting for her little sister. Not to mention she wants everything to be about her with zero respect for her older sister's thoughts. Her sister doesn't want to talk about something but Jane just goes on and on and on wanting to know WHAT happened and blah blah blah. So yeah, there were some twists and turns, I suppose but nothing that was quiet enough to lift it out of it's flop. And the fact that Jane does really get engaged literally 7 months after just meeting a guy makes my eyeballs hurt from rolling them so hard. There were some good parts. I loved the fandom quotes. There was a bit of from the Hunger Games to some Lord of the Rings. so that was cute. I liked this book.

Absolutely love this modern take on the classic Sense and Sensibility -- in fact I actually prefer it to the original! And now that I've offended die-hard Jane Austen fans I'll continue with my review. :-)Love the dynamics between these three sisters. They've dealt with some pretty intense stuff and yet they've stuck together and created a soft place to land...until their life is disrupted in a major way all over again. The Woodwards are nothing if not resilient! Even when that includes an unexpected move to Texas.Which brings me to another thing I love about this version -- the setting! It takes on a life of its own -- at least to this non-Texan-never-been-to-Texas reader anyway. And the author has some interesting quotes that head up every chapter -- some on Texas and some on tea which made the read all the more fun. Plus every chapter ends with a delectable recipe, which, I think, has become a trademark for Hillary Manton Lodge.The story follows along the lines of Austen's book though the author does include her own unique flair -- and some surprising twists. I was gobsmacked by one in particular, though in hindsight I shouldn't have been, but I'm glad it took me by surprise just the same.And speaking of surprising twists. Dash! Be still my heart! Is that not the perfect hero name or what? I won't say another word about him -- you'll just have to read the book to discover why I'm still hyperventilating. (insert sneaky laughter here.)The story is told in first person point of view, alternating between Jane and Callum. It's rife with sardonic wit and piercing heartbreak. And a great cast of secondary characters that help...or hinder...the potential happily ever after.Of note to readers who enjoy an inspirational thread in their Christian fiction -- you won't find it here. It's a a clean read though."}, {"userName": "Hayden", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21854176-hayden", "userReview": "3.5 starsI was a little tentative picking up this book. I've had mixed reactions to this author's books before, and while I was intrigued at it being a modern retelling of Sense and Sensibility, it's told from the perspective of the Marianne character, and Marianne is the One Austen Heroine I Do Not Relate To. However, despite this, I was attracted to the bright cover, promise of Austen love, and the setting of a tea shop.One thing that I liked is that it's told from both Callum's (the Colonel Brandon character) and Jane's perspective (and there are chapter quotes! Ones about Texas on Callum's, and ones about tea on Jane's- including Doctor Who quotes and Caedmon's Call lyrics. This made me happy.) What I think this book did best, though, is managing to stand on its own as a story in its own right. It was definitely S&S, but nothing felt forced like the author was trying to hard to make that story work into this one. It all flowed smoothly.For me, though, there are the usual things it's hard for me to get past in contemporary fiction, especially of the chick lit variety. The kissing, for one. And even things I don't normally think about- like the fact that Celia and Teddy had been dating for what, seven/eight years?-that reminded me that I just have such a different mindset and worldview that most twenty-somethings, even Christian ones. (I'm all for getting to know a person before marrying them, but gosh, seven years of dating? If you're not sure about marrying the guy by that point, you should probably move on- and I'm a cautious person.) Still, Jane of Austin is a HUGE improvement on the last Jane Austen rewrite I read (which was 4 years ago. How time flies). The plot points were worked in well, with some nods to the Austen story that particularly pleased me.Overall, it was a charming, easy read, though I will say if you're expecting a piece of traditional Christian fiction with overt spiritual themes you may be disappointed; Jane of Austin, though from a Christian publishing branch, is more of a secular (albeit clean) variety of novel.I received this book for free from the publisher in exchange for my honest review."}], "description": "\u201cKnow your own happiness.
