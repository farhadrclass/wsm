I always thought these words referred to essays and poetry, but I\u2019ve just learned how well they apply to memoirs, too. Falling Backwards covers Jann Arden\u2019s earliest childhood memories, her school life, and the desire to write and play music, those inevitable young adult struggles and, finally, her first recording contract.I have to be honest and say that I\u2019m a big fan of Jann Arden\u2019s music, which is why I received this book for Christmas, plus her latest CD, and a ticket to an upcoming concert. So, if you think I\u2019m biased when I say that I loved this book, I understand.The book\u2019s appeal isn\u2019t merely because of its author, though. Jann\u2019s voice is strong, authentic, and candid. She talks about some truly uncomfortable experiences in her life that most of us wouldn\u2019t share with friends and family, let alone strangers. Secondly, her writing style is terrific: straightforward, fluid, poignant, funny. She has an ear for the rhythm of the written word, which is hardly a surprise given how much time she put in learning to write songs.Although our childhoods were quite different, (she from the Alberta countryside and me from the Vancouver suburbs), she had experiences I could relate to so closely that it was weird. Here\u2019s one: at her parents\u2019 first parent-teacher meeting in grade one, Jann\u2019s teacher told her folks that Jann \u201ccould very well be somewhat retarded\u201d. My teacher told my parents that there was something wrong with me because I cut the legs off the picture of the lamb I\u2019d drawn . . . That was the 60\u2019s for you. Obviously, many of her memories triggered memories of my own, but maybe that\u2019s what great memoirs do. Still, as Jann says, \u201cIt\u2019s okay to look in the rear-view mirror now and then, but I don\u2019t want to stare.\u201d Enjoy!"}, {"userName": "Leslie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7355733-leslie", "userReview": "I read a few reviews on GoodReads before reading this book, and I found myself agreeing with some of the critical remarks. First, the humour didn't really come across as funny, but maybe Jann and I just aren't a match when it comes to what makes us laugh. Second, I noticed some stories were repeated that could have been fixed with better editing. And the end seemed abrupt.I did enjoy reading about her early years prior to high school, and found myself talking with my husband during a long drive about some of the things she did as a kid. The carefree days of childhood back in the 70's seemed so fun. I told my husband I was surprised at how clear her memories were in comparison to mine at the same age(s). She doesn't sugar coat the ugly truths and I respect her for being so honest. No family is perfect, your past is never without regrets.However, I am left with questions that only Jann could answer... The biggest question (and the one I tried to Google) appears in Chapter Five. What happened to Duray? When she writes that \"they'd lost him the summer of his ninth year\", was that literally or figuratively? She goes on to say that her mother and her pieced together their versions of what they think may have happened, but then doesn't say what they think happened!"}, {"userName": "Lee-Ann Sleegers", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5807728-lee-ann-sleegers", "userReview": "This was a very interesting biography by a very interesting woman who is a household name in Canadian music. I enjoyed reading Jann's life story because she wasn't afraid to reveal the sad, the ridiculous or the difficult from her readers and she put her own special brand of comedy into many of the pages in the book. It must have been hard to write this book without hurting feelings or revealing too much about the other folks in the family that didn't want their stories shared the same way. Jann is very thoughtful of her family members wishes, or at least that is my assumption, in that she only shares about her brothers what you need to know and again an assumption, what they are willing to let her share. The Canadianism's scattered throughout Falling Backwards are hilarious reminding me of a time when life was very different even though it was only 30 years ago.

I did not love the book and for many of the reasons other people already stated: the book barely skimmed through the teen years when she was starting to sing and play guitar and spent a lot of time on her early grade school years instead. There is not a lot of insight or explanation about her musical background or influences. It is amazing that she is basically self-taught, but I would have liked to learn more about where these amazing lyrics and melodies began.

Her road to becoming a successful singer songwriter was not easy and there were lots of bumps along the way. But she shares the ups and downs in an open and honest way and there are lots of \u201claugh out loud\u201d moments along with the really difficult and tragic times.  Jann lived with her family in an area west of Calgary. She was a rambunctious, physical child always outside playing, running around and climbing everywhere with lots of bruises to prove it. She seemed to get into everything. Her older brother Duray was a strong athletic boy, but was troubled from the time he was nine years old. He was often away from the house and frequently in trouble. At first it was just pot smoking, drinking and gas huffing, but that later led to more serious problems and ultimately jail time. Patrick, her younger brother was a really pleasant child, a perfectionist burdened with asthma, who was always trying hard to fit in. Jann describes her parents as devoted to one another, until her father\u2019s drinking and moody angry behavior finally forced her Mum to ask him to leave the house. But he returned in a few short months having found AA and a new path in life. Jann takes us through her years at school and the teachers who had a strong impact on her, not all of it positive. Unlike many, school was never a problem for her, except that she found it hard to stay still. It was mostly playing sports and joking around with her friends. She never studied and didn\u2019t care remotely about anything academic. She tells stories of endless crockpot meals at home, scary perms, harmless teenage parties, and lots of beer and cigarettes. Like any teenager she mulled over the usual issues of teenage angst, feeling overwhelmed by everything, cursed by hormones running rampant through her body and puzzled by deep questions of God and religion.  Jann taught herself guitar quietly and alone in her basement. She wrote songs and lyrics for herself and never intended to share them with anyone. Instead, she stashed them in a hidden corner of her bedroom. Her writing surprised her. She had always been a funny child. Humour had always helped her through her life at home and school and was helping her through life. Yet her music was serious and even morose, a stark contrast to her zany offbeat personality. She had never before realized her aching need to express herself. When she finished high school, she felt pressured to make something of herself and moved to Vancouver. Unsure of where she was going or what she wanted to do, she rented a room in a friend\u2019s apartment and started a downward spiral with alcohol, pot and sex. A job in a cover band helped pay the rent but didn\u2019t get her much further. She was also drinking more, having sex with men she didsn\u2019t know and feeling bad about herself. But she pulled herself out of this funk and moved to her own apartment, busking in Gastown, a gig that allowed her to sing her own songs and also brought in badly needed cash. After a nasty encounter with a thug she moved on again, this time to a month long job as a deckhand on a salmon boat. Her experience on the sea calmed her and provided an easy and cheap rehab. She had now pulled herself together and felt better than she had in ages.  After a two year absence from home, she finally returned, working in her parent\u2019s video store and continuing to write. She landed a job as a back-up singer in a country band, met a piano player named Dave and the two decided to leave the band and tour as a duo act. During one of their many performances, she was noticed by Neil who was interested in helping her with her music career. She left the duo with Dave and worked hard with Neil who ultimately delivered what he promised when he took her on-- a record deal. This is a simple but brave book.It is not easy to put your life on display, sharing your personal missteps in life. We all know that life is complicated and not always easy to understand. But Jann wants us to understand hers, so she does not hold back and the uncomfortable parts are all there: the sadness and fear she experienced as a result of her Dad\u2019s drinking and his angry moods; her frustration and sadness as her brother Duray became lost to drugs and alcohol and her life in Vancouver when she was drinking too much and having sex with men she hardly knew. And when she finally does succeed, she has pulled us along with her, and we are so glad for all that she has endured to finally get where she wanted to go. As you read through the high points and the down times, it is clear where some of the inspiration comes for the words in her music. It is all in her story."}, {"userName": "Pamela Detlor", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8627098-pamela-detlor", "userReview": "Often times, it is the things NOT present that reveal the most.\u201cFalling Backwards\u201d (Knopf Canada) is not a typical celebrity Tell ALL, rife with scandal and unending accolades to ones self: it\u2019s quite the opposite. If you\u2019re looking for something to dish about\u2026 this is not the book for you. There are no photos of Jann posing with other celebrities, standing on the stages of packed venues, or accepting numerous awards. The photos tell a story of family and friends: revealing the things that matter most to Jann.Throughout the pages of \u201cFalling Backwards,\u201d Jann shares memories from her humble beginnings, and being part of a family that love each other through all that is good and that which has to be endured. She takes the reader through the life of an adventurous young girl from the Prairies of Alberta, who is ultimately trying to find meaning in it all. Jann shares glimpses at the people that shaped her world and the experiences that helped her discover who she wanted to be. There are tales of childhood remorse and an early love affair with the wonders of nature. There is learning about loss and the flaws all humans possess. There is heartache. There is laughter and\u2026 there is triumph.Joan & Darrell Richards (Jann\u2019s parents) are the sort of parents any kid would be lucky to have. Though times were not always easy, and there were familial demons to deal with, there was always support and words of wisdom from one or the other. After reading their stories Jann\u2019s songs \u201cGood Mother\u201d & \u201cDaughter Down,\u201d strike an even deeper chord.Jann\u2019s stories will make you smile, laugh, gasp, tear up, and be lifted. Every young girl and woman should read this book as a reminder that we are not what we\u2019ve done or what\u2019s happened to us\u2026 we are what we choose from here forward.

I liked her interactions with Rick Mercer and she's seemed like a hoot. I enjoyed this book and her personality comes through.Jann tells her story of the family's beginnings in Calgary and her early years there. The family moved outside Calgary to the country when she was young. While initially devastated, she quickly adapted by becoming friends with Leonard and Dale who taught her how to shoot a gun and a bow and arrow and they would take rides around the countryside on Snoopy, their big horse.She tells of trying to figure out what she wanted to do with her life. She realized that she wanted to be a singer and moved to Vancouver to make that happen. Except it didn't and she ended up working a variety of jobs including busking in a touristy part of Vancouver and on a salmon fishing boat. Miserable she moved back home a couple years later and eventually made the right connections and become the recording artist she is today.I liked the writing style ... it was funny and sarcastic. But it was also honest as she talks about her older brother's problems with the law, her father's alcoholism, the abuse she put herself through as she was trying to find herself, etc.Jann and I were born the same year so I could relate to a lot of what she talked about. Like Jann, we thought nothing of riding our bikes wherever we wanted and be gone all day, walking to school on our own, etc. She tells the story of her mom making she and her brothers lunches for school. She opened her thermos one day and there was a cooked wiener inside. Because it had sat in hot water all morning, it was huge. I can dig it as my mother did that when I was a kid too ... I thought I was the only one! My mother would also wrap up a bun or a piece of bread with ketchup and mustard to make it a hot dog ... except the ketchup and mustard became glue and I wouldn't be able to pry it apart so I'd eat them separately.Blog review post: http://www.teenaintoronto.com/2014/12..."}, {"userName": "Alexis", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6581438-alexis", "userReview": "This was one of the shortest biographies that I have ever read. For me this floats between a 2 and 3 stars but ultimately I gave it three stars. This is a very honest memoir done in Arden's trademark self-deprecating manner with some humour thrown in. While I am usually very disappointed with most memoirs in that they quickly skim through childhood, practically all of Arden's memoir is about her childhood! This really blew me away. At the half way point of this book she is still at the junior high school point in her life. Twenty pages before the end of the book she gets to the part where she gets her first record contract! There is nada in here about being famous or what happened after she signed her deal other than to tell us where her family is currently in their lives. While Arden is very, very thorough about her childhood, I was expecting a lot more from the book obviously. It's like her editor told her that the time was up and she had to hand it in as is. For example, she talks about a time when she was around 18 or so (3/4 way through the book) and she was still a virgin when some guy she knew jumped her, hurt her and how scared she was and the like. A few pages later she is talking about how she had become primiscuous in Vancouver. No transition, no explanation, nothing. Age 20 to 30 took up very few pages. I really am only giving her three stars because this is the most in depth, well written story about childhood that a celebrity has probably ever put together.

She's just a few years younger than I am and grew up and still lives on an acreage just outside of Calgary in an area that I became familiar with when I lived in Calgary for a few years in the early 80's. I've attended a few of her concerts in Victoria and these have supported the occasional statement I have read about her also being one of Canada's best stand-up comics. Her sense of humour - often at her own expense - shows itself in her biography and it is remarkable that she was able to maintain this during her slow road to success despite personal and family problems. This was an enjoyable read (Jann, I don't see eye-to-eye with you on Barry Manilow's 'Mandy' unfortunately but my wife certainly does!) but I would have given it 4 stars if it had progressed a little further into her professional career; the conclusion came very abruptly just after she signed her first recording contract."}, {"userName": "Tonia", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2986472-tonia", "userReview": "So far Jann is providing the reader with very detailed accounts of her childhood.

Her music has always helped me process life experiences, realize that life is complicated, and that we all hope to have relationships with people we can rely on. After receiving this book for Christmas, I devoured it. As stated above, most of the stories in her book range from childhood to the beginning of her music career and do not extend beyond.

As she graduated and sought to find herself, she worked various jobs including highway construction flag person, fisher-person, busker and others.

Her memoir helped me to better understand her family dynamics and early background growing up near Calgary. This book made me chuckle a few times as it is often quite humorous but it's also a bit sad. There are often repetitive phrases that she uses...'who can can blame them/him/her?', but since this is her attempt at writing, I'll not be too harsh with my (judgmental?)observations.

Made for nervous reading ...with gloves...in a sterile environment."}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2280602-lori", "userReview": "It wasn't what I expected. I read Jann's online journals for years and she's a poet philosopher whose earthy comedy keeps her grounded and I was hoping this memoir would contain more of that beautiful writing, but it didn't. I liked it but I wanted more out of it. It was too simple and the material not fleshed out enough. She's had an interesting life and I was hoping it would be more comprehensive. She's an amazing human being and I'd recommend anyone read everything she's ever written. She has much to share with the world and although I've never met her and never will, I am grateful for her presence on this big blue marble we all call home."}], "description": "This long-time darling of the music industry and singer-songwriter of international renown will capture your heart--and keep you in stitches--with her powerful stories about coming of age as an artist and as a human being.Jann's legions of fans are drawn to her sincerity, wit, humour and that infectious sparkle she brings to everything she does. Oh, and did we mention her sense of humour? Jann's natural comedic talents translate seamlessly into her writing, and her dedicated fans will delight in the details of this memoir--where there is no such thing as too much information. Readers will learn about how her brother used to steal her maxi pads to repurpose as GI Joe bunk beds and how she once got gum stuck in her hair so badly that when she woke up her head was glued to the pillow. But with the good times come the bad, and Jann opens up about the darker side of her so-called prairie-perfect nuclear family and the first signs that her brother was a uniquely troubled young man. Jann's readable prose keeps the reader tuned in as she reminds us of the inestimable value of having a teacher who believes in you, wide-open spaces to play and be a child, and a good mother.", "title": "Falling Backwards", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11302216-falling-backwards", "average": 3.76, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1316697562l/11302216.jpg", "reviews": 132, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/265705.Jann_Arden", "name": "Jann Arden"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Biography", "Cultural", "Autobiography", "Biography"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11302216-falling-backwards", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13530755-falling-backwards", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13155970-falling-backwards", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34688986-feeding-my-mother", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/474996.if_i_knew_don_t_you_think_i_d_tell_you_", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/474995.I_ll_Tell_You_One_Damn_Thing_and_That_s_All_I_Know", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/474993.Jann_Arden", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/474994.Jann_Arden_Living_Under_June"]}
