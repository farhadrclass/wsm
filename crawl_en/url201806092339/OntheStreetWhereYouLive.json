Separated by more than a century, the two murders are nevertheless somehow linked, and worse, she discovers that the killer may still be on the loose. Chilling, thought-provoking, and utterly compelling, this mesmerizing thriller is vintage Mary Higgins Clark, and proves why she remains the undisputed Queen of Suspense.\u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0646\u062e\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0634: \u0647\u0641\u062a\u0645 \u0645\u0627\u0647 \u0646\u0648\u0627\u0645\u0628\u0631 \u0633\u0627\u0644 2003 \u0645\u06cc\u0644\u0627\u062f\u06cc\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u062f\u0631 \u062e\u06cc\u0627\u0628\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u062a\u0648 \u0632\u0646\u062f\u06af\u06cc \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u06a9\u0646\u06cc\u061b \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647: \u0645\u0631\u06cc \u0647\u06cc\u06af\u06cc\u0646\u0632 \u06a9\u0644\u0627\u0631\u06a9\u061b \u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645: \u0646\u0641\u06cc\u0633\u0647 \u0645\u0639\u062a\u06a9\u0641\u061b \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0644\u06cc\u0648\u0633\u0627\u060c 1381\u061b \u062f\u0631 410 \u0635\u061b \u0634\u0627\u0628\u06a9: 9645634253\u061b \u0686\u0627\u067e \u0633\u0648\u0645 1388\u060c \u0634\u0627\u0628\u06a9: 9789645634252\u061b \u0686\u0627\u067e \u0686\u0647\u0627\u0631\u0645 1395\u061b \u062f\u0631 400 \u0635\u061b \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u06af\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0645\u0631\u06cc\u06a9\u0627\u06cc\u06cc - \u0642\u0631\u0646 20 \u0645\u0632\u0646\u06cc \u062c\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0631 \u067e\u06cc \u06a9\u0634\u0641 \u062f\u0648 \u0642\u062a\u0644\u06cc \u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0631\u062a\u0628\u0627\u0637 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0646\u062f\u060c \u062f\u0631 \u062d\u0627\u0644\u06cc\u06a9\u0647 \u0641\u0627\u0635\u0644\u0647 \u06cc \u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0622\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0628\u06cc\u0634 \u0627\u0632 \u06cc\u06a9\u0635\u062f \u0633\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0633\u062a. \u0627\u0645\u06cc\u0644\u06cc\u060c \u0648\u06a9\u06cc\u0644 \u062c\u0646\u0627\u06cc\u06cc\u060c \u067e\u0633 \u0627\u0632 \u0637\u0644\u0627\u0642 \u062a\u0635\u0645\u06cc\u0645 \u0645\u06cc\u06af\u06cc\u0631\u062f \u0634\u063a\u0644 \u062e\u0648\u062f \u0631\u0627 \u0639\u0648\u0636 \u06a9\u0646\u062f \u0648 \u062f\u0631 \u0645\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0647 \u06a9\u0627\u0631 \u0648\u06a9\u0627\u0644\u062a \u0628\u067e\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0632\u062f\u060c \u0633\u067e\u0633 \u062e\u0627\u0646\u0647\u200c \u06cc \u0646\u06cc\u0627\u06a9\u0627\u0646\u0634 \u0631\u0627 \u0645\u06cc\u062e\u0631\u062f. \u0647\u0646\u06af\u0627\u0645 \u0628\u0627\u0632\u0633\u0627\u0632\u06cc \u062e\u0627\u0646\u0647\u060c \u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u062d\u06cc\u0627\u0637 \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u0633\u0627\u062e\u062a\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u062e\u0631 \u062e\u0627\u06a9\u0628\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u0645\u06cc\u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0646\u062f\u060c \u0627\u0633\u06a9\u0644\u062a \u062f\u062e\u062a\u0631\u06cc \u062c\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u064a\u062f\u0627 \u0645\u06cc\u0634\u0648\u062f \u0648 \u0627\u0645\u06cc\u0644\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u0633\u0631 \u06a9\u0646\u062c\u0643\u0627\u0648\u06cc \u0634\u0631\u0648\u0639 \u0628\u0647 \u062a\u062d\u0642\u06cc\u0642 \u0645\u06cc\u06a9\u0646\u062f. \u0627\u0648 \u0643\u0647 \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f\u0634 \u062a\u0647\u062f\u064a\u062f\u06cc \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u0642\u0627\u062a\u0644 \u0628\u0647 \u0634\u0645\u0627\u0631 \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0648\u062f\u060c \u062c\u0627\u0646\u0634 \u0628\u0647 \u062e\u0637\u0631 \u0645\u06cc\u0627\u0641\u062a\u062f \u0648...\u061b \u0627. \u0634\u0631\u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u06cc"}, {"userName": "Khadidja", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21493936-khadidja", "userReview": "the end was so predictable ! i liked it at first but i got bored quickly and there was so many characters i lost count and got confused and bit lost reading this one just naah !! not my cup of tea"}, {"userName": "Nikoleta", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13362307-nikoleta", "userReview": "3,5/5 \u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1"}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1729664-mary", "userReview": "Emily Graham, a successful defense attorney and recently rich, decides to buy an old Victorian home at the New Jersey resort seaside of Spring Lake, that once belonged to her great, great grandmother. Emily has also accepted a job with Todd, Scanlon, Klein and Todd, a nationally known criminal defense law firm in Manhattan. After closing on the house, and trying to establish her life in the new area, Emily receives threats on her life, which she believes are from the stalker that she put in jail four and a half years ago. Believing that he has escaped she lets the police know of the threats. In the meantime Emily hires contractors to have a pool built in her back yard and while they are digging, they find the skeletons of a body buried there. And not just any body, but Emily\u2019s ancestor. Emily now is determined to find out who killed her ancestor, so she starts digging into old files, and seeking answers from the old folks who live in the town. Some of them are happy to give her the answers but some want to keep secrets. As the story unfolds skeletons appear and people are murdered, Mary Higgins Clark introduces extra characters into the story, who in my opinion don\u2019t necessarily need to be there. The reader easily becomes confused of all the characters that appear and from time to time he/she has a hard time remembering their names and their purpose. Towards the last chapters, the reader can easily figure out who Emily\u2019s stalker is, but who killed the young girls a century ago, is also a surprise, since the killer should have been dead by now, in which case the author makes him to be close to a 100 years old. Mary Higgins Clark might be considered America\u2019s Queen of Suspense, but this novel was confusing and not as suspenseful as I expected it to be."}, {"userName": "Kara Jorges", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1705096-kara-jorges", "userReview": "The queen of suspense didn\u2019t build her reputation writing books like this. This is another mediocre effort with too many characters, compounded by not one of them having more than one or two vaguely memorable characteristics. As a result, I never got very involved in what was going on, since I was constantly wracking my brain to remember who was who every time the scene changed. By the time the murderer was revealed, it was insignificant because I couldn\u2019t remember who he was.Emily Graham leaves her life in Albany behind to return to her ancestral summer home in Spring Lake, New Jersey. The picturesque seaside town would have been the perfect stress-free vacation spot if Emily\u2019s pool diggers hadn\u2019t come across the skeletal remains of a woman who had gone missing 4 \u00bd years before, buried atop the bones of Emily\u2019s ancestor who had gone missing 110 years ago. Emily starts her own independent investigation when the skeletons in her yard seem to be connected, along with two other pairs of women who had gone missing 110 years apart. The police reopen the investigations of the women who had recently gone missing while Emily delves into the past, believing the current killer to have knowledge somehow of the historic killer\u2019s deeds and motivations.Meanwhile, the stalker Emily thought was behind bars turns out to be someone else who has followed her to Spring Lake and keeps leaving disturbing messages under her door. There is a dizzying array of suspects, two of whom are distinguishable only by the difference in their wives. I found myself wishing more than once that I had taken notes when I started so the story would have been easier to follow. It\u2019s obvious from the start that Emily\u2019s stalker and would-be murderer are not the same, and the stalker is revealed rather early on.This book wasn\u2019t awful, just hard to follow because of the lack of variation in the characters. For a truly gripping suspense novel, try one of Clark\u2019s earlier books. This one doesn\u2019t measure up to her well-earned reputation."}, {"userName": "Siobhan", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35855553-siobhan", "userReview": "I feel as though the Mary Higgins Clark books are good for quick reads.For me all her books seem to be three point five star books. They\u2019re good if you want something quick to read and yet I never seem to enjoy them as much as I love other authors. They\u2019re sort of just there for when I want something quick to read.I think my main problem is that they all seem to be a lot of the same, in my opinion. Whether it is simply due to the selection of her books I have read or whether such is the case all over I cannot say. However, I only really recommend them if you want something quick. For me they\u2019re never all that gripping and I never really connect with the characters. Whilst she is good at making you question characters it is still quite easy to work out the mysteries well in advance. That is probably my biggest issue: the predictability of her books.As I\u2019ve said, for me they\u2019re nothing spectacular but they do pass the time."}, {"userName": "Gabriela", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14484233-gabriela", "userReview": "Mary Higgins Clark is one of my favorite authors when it comes to reading a quick and good mystery novel.

She\u2019s amazing! I started reading her works way back 2006. On The Street Where You Live by Mary Higgins Clark was the first book I've ever read. I borrowed it from the library. And since then, I started to read all her books. I became fascinated with Suspense-Mystery Crime Books. Criminal defense attorney Emily Graham accepted an offer to leave Albany and work in a major law firm in Manhattan after her divorce has been finalized and experienced being pursued by an obsess stalker. She bought her ancestral home, a site f family tragedy. And she has always been intrigued f her family history.And it all started when the diggers find remains of two victims, one killed quite recently and the other, centuries ago. She decided t investigate and find out who was the killer but unknown to her, she\u2019s the next target of the very devious and seductive killer.This was an easy to read fast paced thriller that kept the readers guessing who the real killer was. There are so many possibilities as to who could be the possible reincarnated serial killer. It was very interesting. Well written with a great plot to keep the readers interested until the very end.This book kept me captivated.After reading this, I definitely want to check out more of Mary Higgins Clark's novels."}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23414964-nicole", "userReview": "On the Street Where You Live is a mystery/suspense novel by Mary Higgins Clark. Emily Graham buys her ancestral home, in the town of Spring Lake, New Jersey following a nasty divorce and the trauma of being stalked. Her family sold the house in 1892, after one of Emily's forebears, Madeline Shapley, then a young girl, disappeared. As the house is renovated and a pool dug, a skeleton is found and identified as Martha Lawrence, a young woman who vanished several years ago. Within her hand is the finger bone of another woman, with a ring -- a family heirloom -- still on it. Determined to find the connection between the two murders, Emily becomes a threat to a killer who chooses her as the next victim.As much as I enjoyed the story and the characters I did not enjoy the style it was written in. From so many different points of view I had to keep going back to remember who's POV I was reading from. It made the story frustrating to read. Since a story should flow together without the reader getting lost I give my rating of 3 stars. If you like mystery/suspense novels and don't mind having to figure out who's POV you're reading from I encourage you to try On the Street Where You Live by Mary Higgins Clark."}, {"userName": "Martha", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7212128-martha", "userReview": "After reading \"Daddy's Little Girl\", by Mary Higgins Clark, I was excited to become engrossed in another of her novels. But, I have to say, \"On the Street Where You Live\", was very disappointing to me. I actually couldn't wait to finish it, just to finish it, not because I couldn't wait for the ending. This story covers eleven days. It starts on Tuesday, March 20, and the \"big\" day that keeps popping up in the book is Saturday, March 31. Kind of eerie, I finished this book today, Saturday, March 31!!Emily Graham, a defense attorney, decides to buy her ancestors' Victorian house in Spring Lake, New Jersey. This house is where her great, great, grandaunt, Madeline Shapley had lived, and the neighborhood where Madeline mysteriously disappeared in 1891. There is intrigue with the reincarnation aspect throughout much of the novel.I only gave 2 stars because there are too many side stories, too many characters, and it didn't wrap up neatly enough at the end. I am not giving up on Mary Higgins Clark. I am sure there are many other good mysteries she has out there. This one just left me irritated, and exhausted."}, {"userName": "Natalie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/944550-natalie", "userReview": "I've only read one or two of her books before but I found this at a used book sale. It pulled me in pretty quickly and I'm enjoying it so far.This was better than I expected. It felt like if I'd read it more awake I might have been able to piece together enough to solve the mystery. One mystery was revealed to us before the other characters knew and that was fun too because we were able to wait to see how everything would unfold.I've only read one or two of her books before but I'll seek out other ones at used book sales."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5527039-sarah", "userReview": "This is my first Mary Higgins Clark novel, and one thing that I appreciated about this book is that I was wrong in who the killer was. The author does a really great job of making it seem as if the killer can be anyone in town, and even better when I think I know who it is, I'm  certain  I know who it is, and am just waiting for the big reveal and... well, damn. I was wrong.And that's a GOOD thing.The only reason, really, why this didn't get more stars from me is because I just couldn't buy into a recent divorcee, who happens to be a criminal defense attorney, being the one to solve not just a series of murders from the past four years, but the series of murders from over a century ago, too.Like, despite the house that Emily Graham buys and moves into being in her family for over a century, she's STILL NEW TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD. She's not there even a week before she's apparently got people giving her their family belongings just because two bodies were buried in her backyard. She's a complete stranger to Spring Lake and she doesn't interact with ANYONE unless she needs something.I mean, she goes out to dinner twice with the local real estate agent, and she does go to brunch with a soon-to-be coworker in the new law firm that she'll start working at once her \"vacation\" is over, but that's about it. She interacts with maybe one neighbor, a Dr. Wilcox, who's a former college president and is doing some major research for a book that he's writing, but like I said, that's only when she needs/wants something. She just asks to borrow some books and Wilcox hands them over, no questions asked.And then, AND THEN, later on in the book, Wilcox visits Emily at her home and for some unknown reason, she's afraid of him and there's really no explanation why. She just cowers away from him, seemingly inconspicuously, and I just don't understand what the point of the scene was, tbh. Maybe she suspected Wilcox was the one doing the killing, I don't know, but I don't even remember why he visited her in the first place.All in all, it was definitely an interesting read. I enjoyed learning the history of Spring Lake, though I would have liked it more had the author spent more focus on the town and the time instead of the people (but I understand why she didn't, I just wanted more information). If you're a fan of Mary Higgins Clark, I think you'll enjoy this, if you haven't read it already. If not, I think it's still an interesting concept and if the synopsis grabs you in, maybe give it a read."}, {"userName": "Kari Anderson", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2611611-kari-anderson", "userReview": "Emily Graham is looking for some peace and quiet. She left Albany after a nasty divorce and a stalking incident that put a disgruntled man behind bars after Emily (an attorney) got a man off the hook for his mother\u2019s murder.She has a job set up in Manhattan, but is taking some time off to get settled in her new home. This home is in Spring Lake, New Jersey, and was her family home, before a family member went missing and it was sold in 1892.As Emily is remodeling the house, and digging for the pool begins, bones are found. But these are the first of many bones to be dug up in the town and Emily is determined to track down the murder copycat who seems to be following the same steps as a murdered from the 1890s. The only thing Emily doesn\u2019t know, there\u2019s one more woman on the killer\u2019s list and that woman is Emily.I listened to this book in audio book and learned two very important things. One, I love Mary Higgins Clark books. Two, I love listening to murder-mystery audio books.Let\u2019s start with the book itself. This was an awesome story. Throughout the book reincarnation is brought up time and time again.I am not telling you if that is behind the murders or not, but it is a reoccuring theme from the first murder to the last. And it made for a great, thought provoking read\u2026or should I say listen. There were many options for the killer in this book, which I love, but there is more than one plot line to follow, which means all the drama in this book could be happening for several reasons.Now to the second part, about listening to murder-mystery audio books. I have listened to quite a few audio books in the past year and I loved this one, for reasons unlike the ones that have made me love others. I loved this book because I got into it so much. When I read books, I am constantly playing out scenes in my head, imaging the characters and their mannerisms and working out the plot before it unfolds in the book. With this book however, I got a little vocal. During the book, from scene to scene, I would try to work out who the killer is and say what I would do next if I was in Emily\u2019s shoes and what I would say to the characters. I always feel like I get involved in character\u2019s lives. In this book though, I felt like I was really there. That may be unhealthy, but it made me fall in love with Mary Higgins Clark for it.I just happened to pick up this audio book at a book sale. I thought the cover was intriguing and I was in the market for any and every audio book I could come across. The one I listened to before this was a Christmas book and I thought this one was too. Don\u2019t ask why. I guess just because the door was red. We all know I had a hard time reading what the book is really about before I dive in. If you do not go to library book sales and use them to expand your reading circle, you, my friend, are missing out. There have been so many awesome books that I have just picked up at a library sale because it was cheap and I have fallen in love with them. I doubt I would have ever picked up a Mary Higgins Clark book. I rarely go pick out books by popular authors (sorry guys). I like to pick out books by unpopular authors and hope that I fall in love with their book and hope my review will help others want to read their books and make them popular.

A defense attorney, she leaves Albany to work in Manhattan after her divorce and the stalking incident following her big court case. She comes into some money and buys her ancestral home in Spring Lake, New Jersey. It's a beautiful Victorian house in the seaside resort. The history of the house is that the family sold the house in 1892, after Madeline Shapley, Emily's ancestor disappears without a trace.When a hole is dug for a pool, the remains of Martha Lawrence (a young woman who had vanished a few years prior) are found along with a finger bone of another dead woman in her hand. Emily dives into the case and uncovers a string of unsolved murders not knowing that she has been chosen as the next victim.I loved this book because of the serial killer mystery theme. Does that make me a weirdo? I just liked the suspense and the all suspect guessing. I loved reading about the killer's point of view. The reincarnation concept was very interesting although it really wasn't possible (this isn't a supernatural novel). Mary Higgins Clark is such a good writer, this book just keeps you at the edge of your seat. I found myself squirming as I shifted from one suspect to another, clearly trying to determine the murderer before Emily Graham figures it out. It was fast-paced, exciting, and un-put-downable."}, {"userName": "Tiago Vinagre", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17518996-tiago-vinagre", "userReview": "J\u00e1 tinha ouvido falar muito desta autora, mas nunca tinho lido nenhuma obra sua.

(Swear I did!) It started getting confusing trying to remember who was who. Then I realized the reasoning behind all the characters. I found it clever how Mary Higgins Clark introduced a super array of characters to keep the guessing game up as to who the murderer was. If I was given 1/2 the names I probably would have guessed the ending so much sooner. (What fun would that have been?) I hate to admit I never saw it coming. So not like me at all, I always figure it out halfway through the book. When the murderer was brought to the pages I was shocked! The book was an easy breezy lemon squeezy read. I live in upstate New York. This March we had two blizzards back to back along with high winds. It rained trees as they came crashing down everywhere bringing electrical lines along with them. Everyone was without power for at least a week. During the restoration time, I sat myself down on the couch wrapped in a blanket, flashlight in hand. I got through all 387 pages in several days. The story did drag a wee bit and could have been told in probably 100 fewer pages. One thing that did occur with this book I never experienced before is I couldn't skim through to find the good parts. Every word contributed to the story. There was no scenery descriptions, lots and lots of tell and little show. I was surprised to find Mary Higgins Clark used filler words in the form of, like, just, really and very. Not to mention the endless adverbs. I coughed this up to the fact the book was written almost twenty years ago when writing styles were different at that moment in time. I ran into the same problem with, The Other Side of Midnight. I read the story when I was a young girl in high school and LOVED IT! I read it again not too long ago and found it so flat I wished I had left it alone with my original opinion. Still, I give this little number four stars. It kept me in the story for the few uncomfortable days until my electric came back and I was pleased with the ending."}, {"userName": "Tannaz", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60617904-tannaz", "userReview": "\u06cc\u06a9 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0633\u0631\u062a\u0627\u0633\u0631 \u0647\u06cc\u062c\u0627\u0646! \u0646\u0645\u06cc \u062a\u0648\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0628\u06af\u0630\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u0632\u0645\u06cc\u0646! \u0645\u0646 \u062a\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u062e\u0627\u0646\u0645 \u06a9\u0644\u0627\u0631\u06a9 \u0631\u0648 \u0633\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0634 \u062f\u0627\u062f\u0645 \u0627\u0645\u0631\u0648\u0632!"}, {"userName": "Dani Noviandi", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4808316-dani-noviandi", "userReview": "Jalan cerita yang cukup lambat dari buku ini seolah menutupi keistimewaan buku ini. Pembunuhan antar abad yang melatari buku ini sangat unik, 3 orang wanita muda dibunuh 1 abad yang lalu, mayatnya tak diketahui dimana. Nah, di abad yang baru ini, tiba-tiba ada lagi 2 gadis yang hilang, satu persatu mayat mereka ditemukan dalam satu kuburan dg para korban di 1 abad yang lalu!

Indikasi ia menjadi korban ialah adanya seseorang yang dg ulet menguntitnya. Dengan tokoh-tokoh lain yang begitu banyak dan berbagai macam karakter, latar belakang, serta permasalahan, pembaca seolah diajak untuk menemukan si penjahat yang sebenarnya. Gaya cerita si penulis yang terkesan menumpuk berbagai macam motif sungguh sangat membingungkan dan membuat gemas. Walau pada akhirnya si penulis menceritakan dg jelas apa dan siapa para tokoh dan permasalahan masing-masing, tak ayal jalan cerita yang berputar-putar ini membuat bosan. Untungnya, twist menjelang akhir buku sangat memuaskan, bagaimana kejahatan ini tercipta dan siapa pelaku pembunuhan yg sebenarnya sungguh membuat berdecak kagum. Mungkin disinilah kekhasan MHC dalam bercerita, mengingat ini buku MHC pertama yang saya baca. Tetapi apabila memang gaya bercerita beliau seperti ini, saya dapat katakan bahwa teh ini bukan cangkir buat saya.

This novel concerns a woman named Emily Graham, who has moved back to her hometown of Spring Lake in which three murders took place about a century ago. Emily becomes involved in the case when the skeleton of one of the victims is found buried in her backyard, and from then on, she\u2019s determined to figure out what really happened to those three victims so many years ago. The main aspect of this novel is, of course, the suspense. Most of Clark\u2019s novels follow the same routine of the damsel in distress somehow getting involved in the murder case, and then finding herself to be one of the victims about to get killed. However, I still find each novel to have its own thrill and unique way of engaging the reader. In this novel, the killer\u2019s point of view was revealed either at the end or the beginning of each day, allowing the reader to connect to him. Being inside of the killer\u2019s mind, the reader can identify his next target, especially when he says, \u201cWell, I have chosen my next victim. She is not Ellen, but she will sleep with Ellen\u201d (240). This stirred the suspense, leaving the reader wondering who is next in line to be killed. The main thing I learned from the \u201cQueen of Suspense\u201d in this novel is to not have too many insignificant characters, which was one of the parts that caused me confusion. After a while, the characters blend together, and when the killer is discovered, the reader isn\u2019t even sure of his story anymore. However, I also learned how to effectively portray the different points of view of the separate characters."}, {"userName": "Hayley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4192442-hayley", "userReview": "It felt good to read a MHC book when I haven't read one in so many years. As always, she leaves me with a smile on face after I just went through a rollercoaster, edge of your seat, can't put it the book down type read.

Meet, Emily Graham, a criminal defense attorney on her way to a new start in Spring Lake, New Jersey after a nasty divorce and having to endure a stalker. What she thought would be an easy new beginning, turned into a nightmare more like.She has just purchased a victorian home that was her ancestors over 100 years ago that was sold by the family due to a young girl, Madeline Shapley disappearing. While renovating the home, a pool was about to be installed in the backyard until two skeletons were found! Come to find out, it was the body of a girl that disappeared a few years ago, and Madeline Shapley! Now Emily wants to find the connections between the deaths and why they were buried together. Like I said, this book was a great read. Full of twists and turns and \"Who Dun It\" scenarios. I actually thought I had the killer pegged, but boy was a I wrong! The only thing I say I didn't like about the book was that MHC creates WAY too many characters that you have to keep up with and sometimes that can be a little hard!
