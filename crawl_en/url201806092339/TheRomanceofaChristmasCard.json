The Romance of a Christmas Card involves a spirited minister's wife with a penchant for writing poems and painting pictures, which she decides to turn into a little extra cash (her correspondence with the manufacturer of the greeting card company is hilarious!), a couple of wayward young men who left town three or four years ago and are estranged from their families, and a selfless sister who's taken care of her brother's motherless twins since the day they were born (he's one of the aforesaid young men). Top it off with a dollop of small town gossip, affection and occasional cattiness.The ending was a bit too abrupt - I really needed a couple more scenes for closure, even though it's perfectly clear what's going to happen - and I wanted to slap some sense into the martyr sister and her irresponsible brother. But overall I really enjoyed it, in a nostalgic turn of the century kind of way.Free online here at AmericanLiterature.com (it' s also on Project Gutenberg, where you can download it). There are some sweet, old-fashioned illustrations for the story on both sites.And yes, I'm going to recommend it to the Retro Reads group. :)"}, {"userName": "QNPoohBear", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22177907-qnpoohbear", "userReview": "In Beulah, New Hampshire, one Christmas Eve, Reba Larabee, the minister's wife, is struck with inspiration seeing her friend Letty sitting by an open window keeping watch over her twin nephews. Reba intends to draw a picture of Letty's quaint sitting room and sell it to a greeting card company. Letty has been burdened with the care of one family member after another for most of her life. For the last three years she has had the care of her wayward brother David's twin babies. Unwanted and unloved by their father, Letty does her best but she wishes David would show some interest in his own sons. As the months change and Christmas rolls around again, surprises are in store for the good folks of Beulah.This is a sweet Christmas tale very similar in vein to Lucy Maud Montgomery and Louisa May Alcott's children's stories. This one is an adult story, told from the perspective of adults, but with all the wholesomeness of the children's stories. It's a little less preachy than children's stories but still tells the tale of the prodigal son. The plot is predictable except the story ended sooner than I wanted it to.I really liked Reba. She seems to have shaken up the town a bit with her energy and liveliness. She and her husband have such a sweet, loving relationship. I felt bad for Letty. She never has an opportunity to be selfish or do anything for herself. The townspeople are amusing for all their narrow-mindedness. They're very much flatter versions of Lucy Maud Montgomery's staunch Presbyterian Prince Edward Islanders. The illustrations are beautiful. This edition has a couple of lovely color plates in addition to black and white drawings. The cover image is important to the story.If you like Victorian moral tales, you will probably enjoy this one too."}, {"userName": "Amber", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23016460-amber", "userReview": "This was a great story about a minister's wife who made two Christmas cards that brought her son and her friend's brother home for Christmas in this great tale of forgiveness."}, {"userName": "Colleen Turner", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3339335-colleen-turner", "userReview": "The Romance of a Christmas Card is a quick, sweet holiday read that makes it hard for the reader not to feel festive and appreciative for all the gifts in their life. Taking the reader to a tiny village in New Hampshire sometime in the early 1900s, this story is one of forgiveness, redemption and a powerful kind of love that makes anything, including a popular Christmas card, seem magical.Reba, the minister's wife in Beulah, New Hampshire, was a model of cheerfulness. After seeing a beautific view of her friend sitting before her front window, candle burning and door open, seeming to wait for someone one lonely Christmas Eve, she decides to make a Christmas card using the image and send it off for publication. After another Christmas card - this one of the front of the same house and poetically talking about the folks back at home - is published they both serve to bring two wayward son's of the village home, both seeking redemption for the wrongs they have done and both finding forgiveness and love waiting for them where they left it.This short story is very endearing but, for me, the true measure of a great short story is when I leave it wanting more. More from the characters or setting or something. After reading this story I feel it ended well and I don't necessarily feel like I need any more. The characters aren't ones I will miss now that I finished reading about them, although I have to say that it was enjoyable reading this short snippet into a small, religious village blanketed in wintery wonder. The beautiful illustrations definitely added to the whimsical, old time feel, something you don't often find in books nowadays. It thoroughly put me in the giving, festive mood of the holidays, which is always a good thing."}, {"userName": "Victoria Minks", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54251522-victoria-minks", "userReview": "Aw so sweet!

If you're easily affected by the books you read, you'll certainly get a lump in your throat reading this one. Lonely Letty Boynton, who has sacrificed her own happiness and a chance at love in order to care for her wayward brother's motherless children, unwittingly provides warm-hearted minister's wife Reba Larrabee with inspiration for a Christmas-card illustration she is working on. The minister has his own troubles\u2014a son who quarreled with him and left home several years before. But Reba's Christmas cards eventually fall into just the right hands to bring unexpected happiness back to both families. Like the best of Wiggin's work, The Romance of a Christmas Card brims with honest sentiment and feeling, with a sparkle of cheerful humor to lighten it at the right moments. A real short gem of a Christmas tale!(Although The Romance of a Christmas Card takes place in a village named Beulah, as in Wiggin's Mother Carey's Chickens, and some of the supporting characters from that book (notable the Pophams) appear, in this story the village is in New Hampshire, not Maine, and there is no other real connection between the stories.)"}, {"userName": "Sylvester", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2289972-sylvester", "userReview": "I wanted to read something Christmasy and this definitely filled the bill.

Old books have a feel to them that paperbacks can't match and that are very different from ebooks. It's the aroma and feel of old pages, the beauty of gold on cloth boards. I don't know. I love old books.Well, this is a very sweet Christmas story about a New Hampshire minister's wife named Reba Larrabee who finds inspiration in the view of her neighbor Letty at her window, so Reba paints and sells the idea to a Christmas card company. She paints another card that is even more popular, and together the two cards effect changes in the lives of several people connected with the town in positive ways. It's heartwarming and inspirational. You never know the effect you may have on someone else by a small and simple action that's motivated by good intentions."}, {"userName": "Cindy Pillatzki", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42829611-cindy-pillatzki", "userReview": "HeartwarmingA tale of young rebellion and Christmas time reunion to warm the heart.

I think Wiggins is a good, entertaining author from a more principled and conservative era (early 20th century), whose stories depict an old fashion lifestyle that most have no experience with in this crazy, modern world. Moreover, she shares a good Christmas message in her stories.This short Christmas story takes place in a small town in New Hampshire where a preacher\u2019s wife has created Christmas cards, verse and drawings, of scenes in the small town that she sells to a major Christmas card vendor. The Christmas cards are noticed by two former residents of the town, the preacher\u2019s son and his friend during his youth, who had left because their youthful indiscretions were not approved by some in the small community. After seeing the Christmas cards both men were inspired to return home for Christmas. They met on the train going to the small town after not seeing each other for years. Both described the power the Christmas cards had on them and their desire to return and see family. The story concludes with the acceptance of families and friends of the two prodigal sons. I liked that this was a story of redemption for the wayward preacher\u2019s son and his rebellious friend. The story illustrates the power of the Christmas, whether through cards or just the season, both of the men returned to the small town of their youth to make amends with family and friends for the problems they caused when they were younger. I enjoyed the depiction of a small community during Christmas with friendships, petty quarrels, helping each other with children, checking up on others, and a Christmas pageants in the small local church. This story reminded me of my youth in a small town and the joy that each Christmas season brought to me and people of the community.I recommend this short story to those who want a good old fashion Christmas story of redemption and forgiveness. Also, to those who want a Christmas story of a bygone era for most people; when small communities with neighborly relationships and squabbles but a general feeling of belonging and inclusion was the norm."}, {"userName": "Gale", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17664194-gale", "userReview": "THE FOLKS BACK HOME....Two households in a quaint New Hampshire village experience yuletide joy in the 1880's when the handmade Christmas cards of the minister's wife are published and circulated nationally. This simple tale of family loss will probalby not appeal to gradeschool children, since the main characters are all adults. This slender book spirits us gently back to a simpler time, when two village prodigals have been gone for three years, leaving gossip and grief behind--not to mention a minister sorrowing over his rogue son and a sister with orphan twins to raise. This is a quiet, short read for a snowy evening. Makes us wonder what it is about a Christmas card which we find attractive enough to buy and send--the verse or the picture. Someone had to design it, thus sharing a little bit of his/her own heart. Perfect to read aloud on a snowy evening... (December 8, 2012.
