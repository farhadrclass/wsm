And you know I'm going to say it: I was confused here and there but it's all okay because it's high fantasy and my tiny brain doesn't compute all things. I loved the idea of the tidal mariner's, although I don't think I would want to be one because of certain reasons you can read about in the book. There be giants! Where did they come from? They are ravaging everything, at least the giants that are not killed quickly by other magical beings. There are multiple POV's in the book. It took me a bit to figure \"almost\" everyone out. There is also a cute little drawing in the beginning telling of who the characters are in the book. Overall, I think it was pretty awesome with a few ick parts involved. I look forward to what is in store for these people in the next book. *I would like to thank Netgalley and the publisher for a copy of this book.*"}, {"userName": "Mogsy (MMOGC)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4379514-mogsy-mmogc", "userReview": "2 of 5 stars at The BiblioSanctum https://bibliosanctum.com/2017/10/17/...Of all the things I expected to feel when I picked up Kevin Hearne\u2019s new epic fantasy, boredom was not one of them. Unfortunately though, there it was, creeping up on me despite my immense efforts to give this book a chance. It actually pains me to admit this, because I love Hearne and he\u2019s an awesomely funny guy who normally writes great stories, but as much as I tried and tried to like this, something about A Plague of Giants just did not work for me.Granted, the book opened with a promising and energetic introduction, setting the scene for a charismatic bard to take the stage before a crowd of weary but optimistic survivors who have all gathered in the public square to hear him recount the history of the Giants\u2019 War. By using his magic, a particular kind of kenning that allows the bard to take on the forms of different people, he begins adopting the physical appearances and voices of the book\u2019s many characters, each of whom have a unique story to tell related to their experiences during the giants\u2019 invasion. Subsequently, we are treated to a parade of these narratives presented to us one after another, letting us see a different character\u2019s perspective each time.The pattern is sometimes broken, however, with glimpses into the present as the bard, Fintan, becomes embroiled in drama resulting from his storytelling. His sections with Master Dervan, a scribe who has been tasked to record everything Fintan recounts, act like interludes to show the day-to-day happenings between each cycle of performances in the square.Speaking as someone who believes that time jumps and multiple timelines should be employed both practically and sensibly, trying to navigate my way through this novel was a convoluted nightmare. The first few character POVs intrigued me, but as they gradually began to stack up with nary a sign how everything might be related, my interest swiftly plummeted. Even when the bigger picture started to come together, it was too late and my enthusiasm failed to come back. That said, it\u2019s important to note that in his acknowledgements, Hearne mentions that serial storytelling was something he\u2019s always wanted to try and I applaud him for his efforts. It\u2019s only my bad luck that I happen to be antipathetic towards this particular format, and later I also felt that it was completely wrong for what the author was trying to accomplish.I hate to say it, but characterization was probably one of the first casualties of this approach. Quite simply, I was inundated and overwhelmed by the sea of names and cultures which were all just given perfunctory nods before being swept aside in favor of frenzied action sequences, and as a result, nothing managed to stick. More authors need to realize that while including diversity is wonderful and important, if your characters are weak and underdeveloped, then the gesture itself loses a lot of its meaning and intent. Incredibly, out of the dozen or so character POVs, there was not a single person in this story I truly cared about. Not. A. Single. One. Usually, when it comes to me and books, that\u2019s the kiss of death.Still, it wasn\u2019t all bad. For one, I was really impressed with the world of this novel, which consists of six different nations each with their own unique customs and cultures. Among those traditions is the magical gift of the kenning, of which there are five when this story begins, though later on a sixth is discovered by a character from Ghurana Nent, making it one kenning specific to the peoples of each nation. Rooted in natural magic, kennings can manifest as different powers depending on the element upon which they are based. While not everyone has a kenning, those who are blessed with it must be cautious not to use too much of their power, because the more they draw on it the more it robs them of their life span. Those who are not careful and who stretch the limits of their power can find themselves aging years in the blink of an eye.Bottom line: A Plague of Giants is certainly an ambitious novel, which must have required a lot of planning and forethought. The incredible world-building is a testament to this, and also why it greatly pained me to have to write this negative review. When all is said and done though, I still maintain that priority should have been on characterization first, and the novel\u2019s failure to do this in my eyes made it a tough read, one that I had to grudgingly force myself to finish even if it meant skimming through some sections. Maybe it was the format that completely ruined it for me, but I doubt I\u2019ll be continuing the series even if the next book is presented in a more traditional and linear manner; I just can\u2019t muster the interest to keep on going.Looking at other reviews though, it appears readers either loved this book or didn\u2019t, and as disappointed as I am to be in the latter camp, I would not discourage anyone from giving A Plague of Giants a try\u2014especially if you\u2019re a fan of the author\u2019s Iron Druid Chronicles and would be curious to see what it\u2019s like for him write something completely different. Here\u2019s hoping you\u2019ll have better luck with it than I did, but I\u2019m sticking with his urban fantasy for now."}, {"userName": "Bradley", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley", "userReview": "I'm actually rather impressed by the first Seven Kennings novel and I'm certain I'm going to be anxious to read the rest... but why? That's pretty easy, actually. Seven nations and several races of giants and regular humans trying to get along in a pretty close approximation of Vikings and Druids, with light magic, no gods, and many peoples just trying to do their damn best with the whole survival thing and understanding their world.We get PoVs from the peoples of both the Giants and the Humans and it's the normal kind of thing that makes them go to war. Population migration, settlements without permission, misunderstandings, pride, and a whole gamut of impressive and realistic reasons that are often skimmed or just plain ignored in Epic Fantasies of this caliber. The magic is certainly not overpowered, either, but even so, big things can be accomplished with it. Unfortunately, the old idea (and disadvantage) of using magic means that it drains your life. Fast. It's a good balance and it even feels real. A few of the more interesting Kennings (types of magic) range from water, fire, illusion, animal calling, and arbor magic. Just imagine Bards and Skalds and a mix of Icelandic and Germanic peoples, with Dirges, bonfires, and the whole feel of Vinland mixed with the Druidic order, Volcanic peoples, and the drive to find and understand the missing Kennings, the far-off lands, the Abyss that separates nations... and you'll get a very nice feel for this book. :) I really had a good time. Hearne has always stood out in my mind for his quicksilver grasp of mythology and history and his ability to weave such into pretty awesome stories. His Iron Druid novels are some of my favorite UFs. He turns around his knowledge and weaves a tapestry of many cool cultures and lands rather than anchoring them all in individuals like he did in the UF. He's building a broad mythology here from scratch and the hints that all the Kennings will become ONE is scary.It almost feels like it could either be a combining, a synthesis, or the complete eradication of all but one or the complete death of magic across the board. The way that these nations rely so heavily on the Kennings, however, means that we can probably expect genocides and shifting alliances, a complicated battle royale of races and peoples as interesting as you please.This author has my trust. I'm really looking forward to how this will pan out. :)"}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28602001-emma", "userReview": "Told in the style most recently popularised by Rothfuss, but harking back to Homer, these stories, performed by a bard to an audience harrowed by war, are impactful and moving. In focusing on a range of individuals relating their own experiences, the book allows the forward movement of the plot to be gradually parcelled out, each story adding to the developing knowledge of both the reader and the audience, while fleshing out elements of this new-to-us world. Instead of the broad mechanics of war between the invading Bone Giants and the various peoples of Teldwen, we have vibrantly personal recollections of lives lived and lost. Some are more powerful than others, but the opportunity to follow certain characters right through to the end of the book means the reader still has the opportunity to build strong ties; their difficulties and bravery are felt, deeply.The world itself is magical, detailed and rich. The system of the Seven Kennings (based largely upon elemental and natural powers) is thrillingly appealing, and I, for one, know exactly which i'd risk my life to achieve. On top of that, the people are diverse in every way you could possibly hope, it is this especially that makes this book feel so genuinely full of life, and so welcome in the broader range of fantasy publishing.I have to say that it's hard to believe that the author of the Iron Druid stories wrote this- that series tailed off so much by the end that I gave up on it entirely, whereas this promises to be something original and positively great. There is some unevenness in the narrative but overall a beginning full of potential.ARC via Netgalley"}, {"userName": "Lyn", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn", "userReview": "Very cool.Urban fantasy master Kevin Hearne demonstrates that he can do High Fantasy too.Fans of Hearne\u2019s fabulously well to do urban fantasy Iron Druid series featuring his 2,000-year-old Celtic druid Atticus O\u2019Sullivan and his wise cracking hound Oberon will want to read this adventure set in a new universe of Hearne\u2019s making.Truth be told, Hearne\u2019s world building is the real treat here. Told in a bard fashion, with our narrator\u2019s ability to take on the illusory guise of any character to better tell his story, we are introduced to Hearne\u2019s creation of a land of several realms and peoples and all recovering from a series of invasions by groups of giants (of about 7 to 12 feet tall). The bard, Fintan, while stretching his performance out over a couple weeks or more, also gets involved in a present time scandal that further develops Hearne\u2019s epic.Hearne does take a while to get where he is going and the first half is confusing as the reader is presented with a panoply of characters (including the giants) before during and after the invasions. Fintan\u2019s presentation of each point of view storyline provides little introduction to what is happening and where and when and how. By the second half I was ready to either DNF or catch on. Happily, I did finally pick up what he was throwing down and came to not only enjoy the book, but am interested in reading more from him in this series.The magic rules of the book are also cool as a twenty-dollar bill found in the laundry. The Kennings are magic abilities related to natural or elemental sources like water, fire, arboreal or animal empathy. Each Kenning\u2019s ability can then be subdivided into various manifestations within the class. People must take a great risk to get \u201cblessed\u201d with the kenning and then pay heavily for its use.Reminiscent of Poul Anderson, Hearne spends time with the invading giants as well and we get to know both sides of the conflict, providing for a more well-rounded story. Also intriguing is Hearne\u2019s portrayal of how the two opposing groups get to know one another and there are hints of grudging respect between antagonists.All in all, a very pleasing first book in a series that promises to entertain."}, {"userName": "Phrynne", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne", "userReview": "I am giving this book four stars not five but only because it did not have that wow factor to capture me right from the start. It was a long and detailed book which grew on me slowly and of course by the end I was totally engrossed - just when it finished!!! And now I have that long wait until the next one:(I very much enjoyed the way the author told the story using a Bard who told a little bit of it every night to crowds of townspeople. Each chapter was in the POV of one of the many characters and it took a while for me to become familiar with each character and sort out who I liked and who I did not. Once I had my head wrapped around the who and the where I was totally engaged and unlikely to respond to anyone who talked to me. Of course Hearne delivered great magic. He has had lots of practice after all with Druids. I loved the idea of the Seven Kennings and could not decide if I would rather have water ( which I think may be the author's own favourite) or animals.All in all a great book for those people who love a really good epic fantasy.

I adore Hearne's Druid series! I couldn't wait to read this but it is nothing like what I was expecting. It started out with about ten characters each telling something in their own chapter apiece, then a kind of summary chapter putting some of this together. Then another round of several characters each having their own chapters then a summary chapter and repeating. Lots of strange names for characters that was hard to keep straight. The way it was told was not appealing to me at all. I am a big fan of his but I won't be following this series, which this book...wait for it...has to be continued!

The world itself is vast and well thought out. The magic system interesting and with great potential. From there we start with the issues. The characters don't stand out at all. I had zero connection to any of them and most were indistinct. I think in trying to be so epic Hearne spread things too thin. Without that identity of character it made the story seem as if it was being told by distracted bystanders or even secondhand.

Every day he stands on a stage and uses his kenning (magic) to project his voice and alter his appearance to match that of the people whose stories he is telling. In between his stage-time the book is from the POV of the scholar Dervan who is transcribing the story being told for record-keeping.Honestly, this method of story-telling is a little bit of a mess but it is an organized mess that for the most part is easy to adapt to. Occasionally there would be a chapter early on that didn\u2019t seem to have any purpose, it was mostly just introducing a character but nothing would actually happen with that character until the next time Fintan talks about them. So it could feel a little disjointed at times. Once the story really got going though, this pretty much ceased to be a problem.Also, because there is the time difference between the story and the storytelling, there is a unique aspect to this book in that it almost gives away spoilers for itself at times. It is mentioned that Fintan has to have met a person in order to appear as them. So remembering while reading that Fintan has had to have met all of these people at one point or another even though their stories can sometimes seem like the characters will never intersect helps make you wonder where the characters are going that will allow at least the one meeting with Fintan. Also there are things that Dervan hears or talks about that teases eventual happenings.That said, the one thing that was a little difficult to keep up with was remembering that the story that Fintan is telling takes place roughly a year before Dervan\u2019s POV. For some reason, it was just a little difficult to remember this while reading the book.The shining light of this book though is the worldbuilding. The nations of Teldwen are divided both geographically and according to what magic each nation can use. All of the magic is elemental based and each nation only has one. So Bryn uses the water kenning, Rael uses earth kenning, Hathrim uses fire, etc. The cost of using large amounts of magic for any of the different types is that if the magic user pushes too hard, the magic will start to age them. The more powerful magic that is worked, the shorter the lifespan for the magic user.Plus, it is unknown who exactly will be able to use the magic until they undergo a trial of sorts. Those seeking a kenning, called Seekers, will either die in the trial or emerge with the ability to manipulate their nation\u2019s element.The rules for this magic system are thus somewhat basic but really well balanced in their simplicity. There are not really any restrictions placed on what an element can accomplish beyond what is intuitive and how much the magic user is willing to age themselves to achieve something. While this seems kind of limitless it is, again, balanced out by the fact that all magic users abide by the same rules. No one nation is overpowered because all of the nations are overpowered.For those that appreciate diversity in fantasy, this book is your book. Not only is the vast majority of Teldwen described as having very dark skin but there is also some LGBT representation as well. There is a little bit of the teenager stressing about coming out to his family but by and large, same sex couples seem to a perfectly normal aspect of life in these nations. This story doesn\u2019t spend hardly any time at all on any sort of \u201ccoming out\u201d plot line and instead just says \u201cthis is a thing\u201d and the story doesn\u2019t treat it like something \u201cdifferent\u201d or \u201cother.\u201d It just is.Futhermore, Hearne did a great job of describing the cultures of the various nations without lingering or focusing too much on any one. There are 6 nations to do that with in this book. The story is very much about all of them and they all get enough \u201cscreen time\u201d to give the reader a good idea of who each people are and what their values are.The only real gripe that I have about this story, and it is pretty minor, is the ending. That is to say, the sort of lack of one.There are three plot lines in this story: the Hathrim giants invasion, the Bone Giants invasion, and some hinted internal division.Only one of these plot lines is wrapped up in any sort of conclusion which made the book feel so open-ended as to make me feel like it wasn\u2019t an ending at all.Again, this is a pretty minor complaint as I went into this fully aware that there would be more books and I think that the open-ended nature of this first installation in the series will allow the next book to pick up right where it left off without having to pick up any momentum that would have been lost in pulling this book together into a huge climax at the end.Finally, I found several quotes in this book that I just absolutely loved. I couldn\u2019t find any place to put this in the rest of the review so I will leave it here at the ending.\n\n\u201cThere is heroism to be found in great battles, it is true: warriors with stable knees who fight and know that they will die for an idea or for the safety of loved ones back home. But there are also people who spend their entire adulthood at a soulless job they despise to make sure their children have something to eat that night so that one day those kids may lead better, more fulfilling lives than their parents. The warrior and the worker both make sacrifices. Who, then, is more heroic? Can any of us judge? I don\u2019t think I\u2019m qualified. I\u2019ll let history decide.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5375148-beth", "userReview": "Hearne writes a complex and masterfully detailed plot of a world where you risk your life to gain magic and you use your life up to use it.

I loved the entire concept but in the end, I struggled with this one. 3.5 stars for me. It took me a while to find myself intrigued and even longer to find myself drawn in. I'm chalking it up to it being the first in a new series with lots of world building. The overall concept is there and makes you want to go on.

Fintan can use his kenning (the magic system) and the power of a seeming stone to take on the guise of the person whose account he is currently retelling and orate across distance, in other words, folks, he\u2019s loud. Raelech bards are also blessed with perfect recall and memory which makes them the ideal storytellers! Each day in Survivor Field Fintan tells the various tales of the Giants\u2019 War to the people of Pelemyn and the various refugees who have sort safety there. When he speaks, they all listen, enraptured by him and the stories he tells. Likewise, you will be transfixed as you read about the characters lives, their exploits, the sacrifices that they make and the horrors that they endure.Interspersed with the tales Fintan tells are the present day to day happens between himself and Master Dervan, a Brynt historian who has been tasked to both write down Fintan\u2019s recounting of the Giants\u2019 War and to also keep an eye on him (the best example that I can come up with is that these parts of the book are similar to the present day interludes featured in the Kingkiller Chronicles books by Patrick Rothfuss). These sections act as the buffer between when Fintan finishes his storytelling each day and when he starts again on the following day.There\u2019s a lot of different PoV characters (11 in total) and at the beginning, the narrative can feel disjointed and separate as you flit from character to character and location to location. It can be confusing at first and you might wonder how all the characters and locations tie in together. But trust me, they do! The origin stories are engaging, different and on the whole, they all add something to the story. As the book progresses, everything begins to fall into place and you find that the pieces start to merge, coming together and forming a coherent story told by Hearne. All in all, A Plague of Giants features an eclectic array of different characters that form a vast tapestry of perspectives woven together from their separate story arcs that feels both personal to the individual characters and epic in nature. If pushed and made to commit then without giving away any details about their storylines, I\u2019d have to say that my favourite characters to read about were Gorin Mogen (a giant from Hathrir), Abhinava Khose (a young male from Ghurana Nent), Nel Kit Ben Sah (a Fornish greensleeve) and Gondel Vedd (an elderly linguist from Kauria) but quite surprisingly for such a large cast, I found each character arc to be enjoyable in their own way and I liked reading about all the characters.I really liked Teldwen, the world that Hearne has created, consisting of six nations (Ghurana Nent, Brynlon, Rael, Forn, Hathrir and Kauria) it\u2019s rich, full of different cultures and vast in scale and though we only visit certain areas and locations I\u2019m sure that we\u2019ll see the unexplored areas in future books.The seven kennings of the book\u2019s title refer to the magic system used by Hearne. Each nation of Teldwen is home to a single kenning, not everyone has a kenning but those that do can only possess one individual kenning. So far, there are only five known kennings (the elements air, water, earth, fire and then flora too) but there are rumours that six or even seven kennings could exist, meaning that there are as yet two kennings still to be discovered. With each kenning, there are different castes that manifest different abilities. The magic can be powerful but it also has a cost and the more you use and stretch the power and limits of your kenning the faster you age.I found Hearnes writing style to be engaging, he easily draws you, making you want to continue reading even when life is calling and you, unfortunately, have to put the book down. He\u2019s able to give individual voices to all his main characters (who are an eclectic and diverse mix of both young and old and male and female characters) also including plenty of emotion (to make you invested and care), humour (to make you chuckle) and action (we all love some sweet fighting scenes) in his story that all adds up to a terrific, well paced and time-devouring read.A Plague of Giants is a big boy, it\u2019s a 600 (a smidgen over) page tome and while not in the same 1,000+ page length as some other epic fantasy books out there it is still a big book. It\u2019s the biggest I\u2019ve read in quite a while and that dear readers make for a hefty sized book!I\u2019m not a professional, I\u2019m just a normal guy who is a reader and a lover of fantasy. I\u2019ve read enough books in the genre to know what I like and what I dislike in fantasy and apart from a couple of very minor slight grievances (I found the large amount of PoV characters to be confusing at the beginning \u2013 which I already mentioned at the start of the review. And due to that large cast of characters it also takes a good while for all of the players to be introduced into the story) overall I really couldn\u2019t fault A Plague of Giants. I found it to be an outstanding read and I look forward to continuing the series.\ud83d\udc4cA Plague of Giants is fantastic giant-sized epic fantasy."}, {"userName": "\u2665Rachel\u2665", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5481477-rachel", "userReview": "DNF @25% which is about 156 pages considering this is 624 pages long.

There are a shit ton of POV characters in this book; Add to that some really heavy world building lore, sophisticated magic systems, a lot of unpronounceable names, and a narrative framework that you don't really see used that often...well...it leads to a lot of work on the readers part.Now don't be fooled, I consider myself a very advanced fantasy reader, but this book was tough.I'll tell ya what though, after those 150 pages or so I found my footing and started to really enjoy myself. Kevin Hearne is an author that I have never read before. I'm aware of his Iron Druid series and its been on my TBR for a long ass time now. I've just yet to feel inspired to pick it up and give it a go. This one, however, with the cover art, and the chance to jump onboard something brand new, it called out to me.So here we are.Once I got a grasp of all the characters you follow in this story I started to really enjoy traveling with them. They are a very diverse cast and there wasn't really any one of them I didn't enjoy spending time with. The actual narrative frame...the in-between bits that tie everything together was also a lot of fun.The author has put a lot of work into the history and lore of his world. Something that I always really appreciate. A good world building story is always a lot of fun - and it is here that Kevin Hearne definitely excelled. From the foods - the clothing - the daily ways of life - and the varied walks of existence, be it the peoples or the floral and the fauna, it all felt very real and alive. I really, really enjoyed being a part of this world.I also appreciated that not everyone gets a happy ending in this story. Nobody is safe and danger lurks around every corner.All in all, I had a helluva good time (except for the training wheels period of the first part of the book), and I am now very excited to see where the story goes in book 2.If you like fire wielding giants, territorial invasions, flying meat-eating squirrels, unique magics, well-written action scenes, and a colorful cast of characters peppered with some light political intrigue, then you could do worse then Plague Of Giants.Cheers, Kevin Hearne! Well met and thanks for the story!

Their exclusion of A Plague of Giants as a candidate for Best Fantasy is an egregious oversight on their part. This book definitely belongs in the running. Thank the Goddess Kaelin that they allow write-in votes. Kevin Hearne, best known for his Iron Druid series featuring Atticus O\u2019Sullivan, has decided to take a hiatus from urban fantasy and tackle the world of high fantasy and it promises to be epic. Readers may think that moving from a series that required knowledge of Earth gods and mythological characters and a familiarity with Phoenix\u2019s best Irish watering holes to a trilogy requiring full-fledged world building with a multitude of characters from different backgrounds and cultures may be too much for some writers. Hearne makes it look easy. In the first book of a proposed trilogy, Hearne has chosen a unique and imaginative way to tell the story of a continent invaded by a heretofore unknown race of giants. He employs a bard, Fintan, to tell the tale of the seven kennings. But this bard doesn\u2019t speak with only one voice. As part of his kenning (a blessing with special abilities bestowed on a small number of people) he is able to assume the voice, the appearance, and even the size of a wide variety of characters and tell their stories in their own words. His stories are told from the viewpoints of giants, humans, scholars, spies, mothers, parents, children, warriors, tradesmen, politicians and heroes and more. Each character is lovingly crafted and imbued with a life of their own, including aspirations, fears, insecurities and guilts. When they fall, and some will, you will grieve for them, even for some that you considered enemies. Be advised: This is by no means a book for younger readers. It includes language and sexually explicit conversation that some discerning parents may consider rude, crude, and socially unacceptable. My opinion is that not everyone is always polite and well-spoken and to expect readers to believe a world exists where giants and villains don\u2019t curse is, at the very least, inauthentic. Additionally, readers who are offended by the presence of sympathetic LGBT characters may wish to avoid this book. One such character is Abhinava \u201cAbhi\u201d Khose, who promises to play a significant role in the trilogy. We first meet this young man while struggling with how to tell his parents that the life of a hunter is not for him. Trust me, you will want to follow his story. It\u2019s doozie. *Quotations are cited from an advanced reading copy and may not be the same as appears in the final published edition.

I will be reviewing this book for the podcast here shortly so here\u2019s a short review. Quick recap of the plot. A mysterious race of giants invades the \u201cknown\u201d continent and begins wiping out cities. Meanwhile a known race of Giants has their island wiped out by a volcano so their refugees invade another country in order to begin rebuilding. This is a story about how the non-giant races attempt to repel these invasions. This is mostly attempted with magic since giants have an obvious hand up in the physical department. The world building in the book is absolutely amazing. Hearne has created a unique and uniquely dangerous magic system that requires a blessing from each group\u2019s god, (who isn\u2019t an active participant in the world), that is usually far more likely to end in a supplicant\u2019s death than result in magical ability. Using too much of the power has its consequences as well. He has fleshed out diverse and different cultures that includes normal sized and giant humans, each with their own cultures. Hearne uses a really unique way to create a multiple POV character book. It\u2019s not really a spoiler to say that a Bard, a magical class is actually telling everyone\u2019s story. His POV is the only one usually in real time. This disconnect from the actual characters, along with some difficult names and a fairly large number of POV who don\u2019t interact very often made for a story that could be disconnected and until the very end I was going to give this book a 4-4.5 rating because I didn\u2019t think I cared all that much about what happened to the characters as their story was told. Then the grim nature of the story took hold and as happens hose characters began to die and I felt horrible about their deaths and I realized I cared quite a bit about them.Once I\u2019ve had some time to think about it, and I don\u2019t have my toddler sitting on my lap telling me to sing along to Little Einsteins I will update this review a bit"}, {"userName": "Kitvaria Sarene", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1126371-kitvaria-sarene", "userReview": "While I love Hearne's Iron Druid Chronicles, this one somehow didn't work nearly as great for me.For the actual book I'm giving 3,5 stars, for the audible version 2,5.The story is interesting, but while with Kingkiller chronicles the idea of the story being told after it all happened worked well for me - with this book it didn't... It somehow lost suspense, and the jumps between now and the telling of what was before didn't feel as smoothly. I don't like songs/poems in books much, and the one's in this one didn't interest me at all. In the book I would just skip them, in the audio it was annoying, especially as the poor narrator actually has to \"sing\" them, and for the life of me I can't see that engage a big mass if people, even in a time without TVs and such entertainment...I did like the characters, so I still go for 3,5* and I especially liked how not everybody made it to the end. They were very different to each other and I liked the different cultures and personalities! The worldbuilding was nice - but somehow just didn't 100% click with me at times... Good ideas, but somehow it just didn't really catch me.The humor I so enjoyed in the Iron Druid Chronicles did seem a bit off in an epic fantasy. In those I do enjoy some sarcasm and witty banter, but I did roll my eyes quite some times.For the audible version - using the same narrator as for the IDC didn't work well, as the narrator used the same \"voices\" so I didn't see the new characters moat of the times, but it was characters of the older series that sprang to mind for most of the book. There's a second female narrator, and I had to concentrate really hard to understand her, and I often found myself rewinding, as I lost focus and had no idea what had happened.

Too many characters and places and names that overwhelmed me whilst reading. The plot was a solid standard fantasy, magical deitys or kennings which were different from each nation. However, its the characters and writing style that didnt work. The characters never really appealed to me. I also felt like as each tale was being told in 1st person it was hard to really distinguish any sense of change from character to character. The idea and scope of the novel was great, with a bard retelling stories through multiple characters over time. I just found it didnt work for me. Ive never read any Hearne before so am not familiar with his work. But I guess and from what Ive heard the Druid series is 1st person. I guess thats his style, and hes attempted a muitlple 1st person POV fantasy epic which just didnt work for me."}, {"userName": "Judy Lesley", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4814399-judy-lesley", "userReview": "I received this book through the Amazon Vine Voices Program and Del Rey.I liked this book enough to give it a four star rating, but not enough to continue on with the series when the second book is released. One of the problems I have had with the Iron Druid series was that there were so many different points of view in each novel that it was sometimes hard to keep track of where I was supposed to be and with whom. This first book in the Seven Kennings series has that same issue in spades. There is Dervan the narrator who interacts with the bard and holds the story together. Then there is the bard, Fintan, who tells the story of the war which has just been waged to the survivors gathered in one city and uses a creative invention by the author which allows him to take on the physical appearance of the person who's story is being related. Each day Fintan and Dervan gather in the town square and the bard sings before he assumes the physical manifestation of the person telling their portion of the story. Some days there are more seemings (where the bard takes on the appearance of another) than others, but the action has always already taken place. There are nine more characters who have their part of the story told. Each chapter is divided into days, there are 19 days in all, and within each day there is a label with the character's name in it to tell you who is speaking. With a little over 600 pages in the book and with so many stories being told, you can bet I got my characters mixed up at times.The world Hearne has developed here is complicated. There are many different nations and each has its own speech, religion, and main source of earning a livelihood. Within each nation there are people who have a 'kenning', a gift which sets them apart from others; they must specifically seek this kenning and few are chosen. Those who don't survive the attempt die. There are five kennings already known and the sixth kenning is discovered in this first book. The remaining books in the series will be the search for the seventh kenning. It is very obvious that Kevin Hearne has been in the process of planning and writing this saga for a long time because he has developed so many differences in the appearance of the people and almost all the plants and animals are new inventions. My main qualm with the story is that it is so large with so many circumstances and battles and discoveries and the author had to continue throughout the book to grow the abilities of each kenning and even added a character toward the end of the novel.I gave this book four stars because I found it interesting. Notice I say that it was just *interesting* for me. I don't have any desire to know what the seventh kenning is. Because of the makeup of what cost a kenning can have for a person when they utilize it to its maximum potential some favorite characters were lost along the way. The next book following will be called A Blight of Blackwings and the descriptions of those birds in this book was enough to turn me off that book right there. However, I'm sure new characters are waiting in the wings to join this story and the search for the Seven-Year Ship and the seventh kenning will go on."}, {"userName": "Kristen", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7675267-kristen", "userReview": "Full review is here, on my blog.This story was told in a really, really interesting way. Similar to The Kingkiller Chronicles in a way, this story is told by a bard, but instead of telling his own story, he tells the stories of others to create one giant (#sorrynotsorry) narrative about a series of events. He tells the story not only of the characters but as the characters night by night. I really liked that. It was told in the first person, but actually told secondhand by someone with perfect memory who was told the story and is retelling it with the flair that only someone with his specific powers can do.The book opens with a Dramatis Personae \u2013 a short description of most of the characters here \u2013 with drawings of each of them. I really liked that, because having a good idea of what they looked like was neat. It\u2019s an awesome reference for using as you read.This world has all of a sudden been invaded by giants. Seven or eight foot tall pale and extremely gaunt men and women that nobody has ever seen before and nobody can understand. They must have come from across the once-thought-uncrossable ocean, but nobody knows why. They\u2019ve killed everyone they\u2019ve come into contact with and gone on their way. So, where did they come from and why?Characters in this book have \u2018kennings,\u2019 which is like a very specific magical power depending on where they live. Each land has a kenning. There are five so far that we know of: Fire, Wind, Water, Earth, and Plants. Some people in their respective lands choose to gain powers based on the kenning of the land. They risk their life for the chance. Their vocation is based on their kenning in most lands. For example, Tallynd is a tidal mariner. She can control water. She can more or less become water, allowing her to travel very quickly across long distances of ocean, change the currents of the ocean, and breathe underwater. It comes with a cost though, and the cost is years of life. The more she uses her power, the faster she ages. So, she\u2019s a tidal mariner. The most powerful kind of water-kenning user. She guards the ocean from invaders, looks for things along the bottom, helps boats entering or exiting the port\u2026 that kind of thing. That\u2019s her kenning, and that\u2019s her job.There\u2019s so much more going on here than the invasion of the bone giants. There\u2019s also the displacement of an entire nation of other giants (these ones being giants that everyone does know exist- they\u2019re locals from the land of the first kenning). An entire nation has had to evacuate their land due to a volcano eruption. They move to a spot of land that seems perfect for them, but\u2026 well it\u2019s kind of owned by someone else, and is on the borders of a land that protect their trees with religious zeal and who rather do not like the idea of a people known for their production of steel and glass cutting them all down to feed their forge fires.So, the story all begins to come together as you see it from the POV of several people from several places around the world who have different reasons to be where they are, and different skins in the game. It\u2019s a really interesting way to lay a story out. There are really neat little details abound too, like different idioms and slang used in different lands. People from Forn (plant kenning) use idioms about roots, growing, fertilizing, and things of that nature (#stillnotsorry) to reference or explain things in their everyday life. Characters in this book are men, women, gay, strait, and just about every skin color under the sun, and none of it mattered in the grand scheme of things. They were of course noticeably different races and genders, but aside from those noticeable differences, were all just people to everyone else. Not better or worse, but different, with a different story. That was pretty awesome.And finally\u2026 what I thought of it, all told. I admittedly struggled to stay interested in this one in the beginning. It\u2019s wonderfully written, and there was nothing in it that I found inherently off-putting, but I found that it didn\u2019t immerse me as much as I hoped it would right out the gate. I ended up reading another book in between chapters 1 and 3. This is rare for me, as usually I try and power on through one book at a time. I found myself finding excuses to do other things, putting it down every few minutes, that sort of thing. However, this passed after I got used to the story, and became more immersed in it. Truth be told, I think this happened right around Abhi\u2019s story\u2019s beginning, as I really liked him as a character. I didn\u2019t care quite as much for anyone else, though. I suppose this sort of thing is bound to happen to me every now and then. I liked the setting. I think it\u2019s a really interesting world, with a really well thought out and well executed magic system. While it wasn\u2019t my favorite Kevin Hearne book, I still think it was a really, really good book all round.Thanks to Random House/Ballantine via NetGalley for the advance copy of this book."}, {"userName": "Juli", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38617426-juli", "userReview": "I am a huge fan of Kevin Hearne's Iron Druid series. When I heard he was starting a new high fantasy series, I was so excited! I totally jumped at the chance to get my hands on an advanced reader copy of this book. I cleared my schedule and spent two days just devouring this book.....total binge reading!Sometimes when a favorite author goes in a totally new direction, it's a hard change. There have been times that I was so engrossed in a series that ended after multiple books that I just needed a break from that author, or was just unable to make the transition to a new, different series. As a big Iron Druid fan, it took me a day or two after I got the digital ARC for this book to build up the courage to start reading. But once I started....I couldn't stop. Wow! I loved this book! It is totally different from Iron Druid -- don't expect it to be similar in any way. Best to approach this series as something totally new. Hearne creates a world filled with magic that is invaded by giants. The tale of the war and the aftermath of battles is told by a bard, Fintan. Over the space of 19 days, Fintan tells the story of the Giants invasion, taking on the appearance of different leaders, victims and heroes as he does so. His storytelling is magical and mesmerizing. Usually I am not a fan of multiple, changing points of view, but Hearne weaves his story well and this time, it worked. The story of invaders, death, fear, destroyed cities, victory and defeat.....all of the many aspects of war....... really worked well with the changing points of view and Fintan morphing into one character after another during his performances in the City of Pelemyn. This book is high fantasy. Hearne delivers a detailed, exquisite world ravaged by war, yet where there is still hope for humankind. I'm not going to divulge much about the plot because each reader needs to have the story unfold for themselves. For me, I could see each scene playing in my head like a movie for the imagination. My favorite character, hands down, is the tidal mariner. Her duty is to protect the city's port. She glides through the water looking for trouble, and when she finds it, she can magically manipulate water. Her kenning comes at a price (as for all who wield magic in this world). The more magic she uses, the faster she ages. She might go in the water in her mid 30's, but come out much older. All in all, a beautifully complex and engaging fantasy tale! I can't wait for more books in this series! I want to know what happens next! A Plague of Giants is the first book in a trilogy, The Seven Kennings. The other books in the series will be titled A Blight of Blackwings and A Curse of Krakens. The cover art for this first book in the trilogy is supremely awesome! With the final book in the Iron Druid series slated to come out in 2018, I wondered what fantasy series could possibly fill the void left in my fantasy genre reading. I think I've found it. The fact that it's also written by Hearne makes it perfect. The Seven Kennings is totally different from The Iron Druid, but magical and mesmerizing!For more information on Kevin Hearne and his books, check out his website: https://kevinhearne.com/"}, {"userName": "Alex Andrasik", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7696083-alex-andrasik", "userReview": "This is a review of an advanced reader copy I received via Edelweiss.Had to give up 50% through this one, as I'm just not getting into it. Which sucks--I had been looking forward to reading Kevin Hearne. I'll still try his Iron Druid books, but if the writing is similar I may have to abandon those too.Good ideas here: a continent of several societies, each dedicated to a particular deity, whose particular characteristics shape the culture as well as imparting specific types of powers to the local magic-wielders. Part of the action focuses on the discovery of a long-rumored additional set of powers. But the main event is twofold, a two-pronged invasion by two sets of giants--one a displaced people from within the larger society, the other a mystery race of pale savages. The political ramifications of the former, and the theological mysteries of the latter, drive the action.The story is told in a series of chapters delivered by a bard recounting the events of the resultant war to a city full of refugees. What should be a dramatic narrative structure is blunted by a silly, pointless contemporary subplot and the laughable style of the storyteller. The delivery of transitions from one plotline to the next feel more like that of a TV variety show host than a bard steeped in the magic of storytelling. And the conceit that the bard uses some of his magic to take on the appearance and voice of the narrators of each chapter is contrived, a too-easy excuse for the author to sidestep the invention of a truly novel mode of oral storytelling, or to at least adapt one from our own history.Hearne has also fallen into the trap common to Sanderson, Rothfuss, and, I suppose, other contemporary fantasists of using modern vocabulary and diction in his story, perhaps to signal a separation from the stylistic epoch of Tolkienesque pseudo-medievalism. This abandons the timeless quality that I personally prefer in my fantasy for something that feels too rooted in the twenty-first century. He also follows those authors in an unfortunate insistence upon attempting sitcom-style humor throughout the book. Thus we have repeated nonsense about mustard and gift baskets.Characterization is weak here, to my mind. One example: the family of one character is wiped out, and the character's reaction is decidedly muted, flaring up when it suits the plot but otherwise oddly understated. Some of these stoic-seeming reactions could be put down to cultural differences, but the amount of loss experienced by characters in only 300 or so pages does not track with the overall sense that the emotional stakes are very low for these people.There are too many characters across too many distinct cultures with too many divergent superpowers. I will give this book points for diversity, though. It takes place in a multicultural society whose overall population consists largely of people of color, and the author does a nice job of creating distinctions between and among them. Strong women make up a good proportion of the POV and supporting characters. LGBTQ characters and lifestyles are also represented as normal and accepted in most quarters. It's a good book for representation in general. I just wish it were of higher quality."}, {"userName": "Iryna Khymych", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58666784-iryna-khymych", "userReview": "I received a free copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review. Thank you publisher!It's a DNF for me at 400 pages. I gave this book a month and 400 pages. I tried so hard but I just cannot do it, it felt forced and it pains me to give it a DNF, yet here we are.A Plague of Giants is a very dense epic fantasy. It is a book written in the style of a bard telling the story to a crowd, after a disaster has truck. I would compare it to the style of storytelling of The Name of the Wind but way more confusing. I read that Mr. Hearne wanted to write a book in this style for years and years and he finally was able to do it. I think the story needs a lot of editing to make sense. It was so jumbled that at time I had no idea what I was reading. I think the story started coming together at 200 pages. That's what I finally started understanding what was happening somewhat. I am not a newbie to dense fantasy. I have read The Malazan Empire Series, Lord of the Rings, The Wheel of Time, Stormlight Archive, A Song of Ice and Fire, etc, yet this, this was a mess. Furthermore, the characters were so flat that I honestly couldn't care for any of them, well maybe the bard but even for him I was lukewarm. That being said, the world which Hearne created is AMAZING! It is set in the archipelago of different island, with 6 different nations all of which have different talents to manipulate fire, water, air, etc (called Kennings). We join the story after an attack by the 'bone giants' and giant giants and how much of the wold was destroyed. From here on out, we hear different accounts of how these two invasions happened from different sources in the archipelago. I love how diverse Hearne makes the world, you have multiple POC and even gay characters. I applaud his attempt to be all inclusive and diverse. This is why I gave the book 400 pages! I WANTED to love it. If ONLY the execution was better I think this series would be an instant epic fantasy classic to rival the classic ones. Unfortunately, the book is so confusing, so jumbled that it did not do it for me. Additionally, and maybe I should have anticipated this, if you are writing epic fantasy, please, please, please, for the love of god, do NOT use modern slang! It takes the reader out of the story and makes the fantasy world unbelievable. I do not think I have ever read the words such as \"yeah\"and \"guy\"and some modern expressions in other epic fantasies. It's sloppy and it shows that you did not think the world through.

It is at times, absolutely brilliant and at other times, maddeningly frustrating.First, the positives:The author, Kevin Hearne, well beloved for his urban fantasy series, \"The Iron Druid Chronicles\", has proven time and again that he is a master of detail and can weave a great plot. For this new series, \u201cThe Seven Kennings\u201d trilogy, he has created an amazing and fascinating world with a well-thought-out magic system. This is true epic fantasy, and in his own words, the plot summarizes as follows:\n \u201cA continent that has enjoyed centuries of peace is abruptly attacked by two different giant armies and its people must figure out how to stop forces that appear unstoppable. It\u2019s a second-world fantasy and has nothing in common with Iron Druid \u2014 this is a completely new thing. And it\u2019s truly epic, twice as long as any of my Iron Druid books at 624 pages.\u201d \nThe characters are well-designed, unique from each other in every aspect and come from different cultural backgrounds based on their locale and or access to the various kennings (sources of various types of magical powers). This is a world I would like to know much more about and discover more about how it all fits together.I love it when an author breaks the mold. Especially an author who is immensely popular for a certain style and then takes risks anyway to explore his/her own passions. Hearne\u2019s storytelling technique in this novel (and presumably for the following two books) most definitely breaks the mold. He uses a bard to tell most of the story\u2026a framing device for a much larger tale\u2026a bard that each day tells the story of the attack of the giants to an audience of refugees. The really cool thing about this bard is that he can physically transform into the person whose point-of-view he is currently relating, including all of their memories he has been privy to. So each day, the bard transforms into 2 or 3 or 4 different people and tells the story of the attack from very personal viewpoints. There is also an intriguing spy plot to the novel and in fact, a major aspect of the novel is the very nature of the bard himself who becomes an unreliable narrator. We readers must decide whether or not he is trustworthy with a true, necessary, and even cathartic tale to tell or if he is peddling lies.Sounds wonderful but unfortunately, most of it just didn\u2019t work well for me. We readers are plunged right into the middle of the action from the get-go and exposed to dozens and dozens of unfamiliar terms, including place names, character names, strange terminology, etc., all supporting the world building more than the story itself. I am no stranger to dense or challenging fantasy and I feel comfortable that this sort of opening will all mesh together and gel before long. But that didn\u2019t happen here, at least not for a long while. For the first half of the novel, I came close to giving up on it several times. Since the bard takes on the persona of whomever is telling the tale, he is always describing events from a first-person perspective. While this can lead to more empathy with characters in normally-constructed novels, here it adds to the confusion. No matter which character you\u2019re reading about it is always \u201cI\u201d did this and \u201cI\u201d saw that. These individual stories are also told in a non-chronological order so the time frames also get confusing. And since this is fundamentally a story about war, many of the characters suffer severely and/or die. That\u2019s Ok with me except that sometimes we\u2019ll be sailing along with a character only to have the viewpoint switch and find out that the previous character has just been killed. I never really felt connected to most of the characters and so didn\u2019t really care too much for their fates, a sure sign that all is not well for the book.So, yes, I was frustrated for most of the first half of the book and I really only kept reading because I  did identify with a couple of the characters and was interested in their stories. But the second half of the book did, finally start to gel and I began to gain a better understanding of how all the moving parts fit together. The complete story of what was transpiring and to whom was becoming clear. I wish I had book two ready to go, mainly for fear that I will need to learn all of this over again, a chore I am not relishing. I will have to decide if I am willing to undertake that effort or if I will stop here and pursue other works.So\u2026to the rating: 2 stars (at best) for the first 25-50%, and 4 stars for the second half. Some sections, particularly near the end when we finally get to experience the battle below \u201cGodsteeth\u201d are definitely in 5-star territory. But taken as a whole, I must settle on 3 stars.Thanks to NetGalley and Del Rey Books for a free electronic ARC in return for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Bonnie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5136858-bonnie", "userReview": "DNF @ 20%I really loved the first few installments of Hearne\u2019s Iron Druid Chronicles but I called it quits after book four. The humor was still there, the great characters, but it started to feel very repetitive. I heard about a brand new series coming from him and was so ready for a fresh new story. And one about a fantasy world with giants and magic? Oh man, I\u2019m so disappointed this wasn\u2019t all I had hoped it to be. The opening was extremely promising, where a bard with magical abilities begins to tell the story of the Bone Giants. He\u2019s able to take on the appearance and voice of individuals so most of the first chapters were voiced by a different individual with a different perspective of things ongoing. Around the time when Hearne attempts to merge their storylines together was when he lost me. There were too many characters with obscure names, too many points of view, and too much to keep track off right from the beginning to keep me invested.I received this book free from the Publisher in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review."}, {"userName": "Christina", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/294046-christina", "userReview": "A Plague of Giants is the first book in acclaimed author Kevin Hearne\u2019s newest fantasy series the Seven Kennings.I am going to be completely honest. I almost gave up on this book. I don\u2019t normally DNF books. I can probably count on one hand the number of books in my life I have done this with. But, this one nearly pushed me to that brink. The only thing that stopped me was a friend telling me to give the book at least 100 pages and it actually took me about 150 to 200 pages in this 600 page plus book to really warm up to the story. It started off a bit confusing for me in terms of time frame and the constant switching of all the character viewpoints. I eventually came to enjoy the multiple storylines and characters, but at first it felt very disjointed and didn\u2019t flow so well. A Plague of Giants is basically a story in a story. Told daily over a period of time by the bard, Fintan, is the story of the events leading up to their world being invaded by giants and the aftermath. The Bard, who in this world has perfect recall and can project his voice to everyone in the surrounding areas, also has a special way of being able to take on the visage of the person whose story he is telling at that moment, making it all the more impactful. Day by day he is informing the people of (insert town name here) what took place in other areas besides their own, why it took place, and what was involved. He weaves a fascinating and informative story of both tragedy, hope, and heroism and how every day, ordinary people can become extraordinary in a blink of an eye. Kevin Hearne is a fantastic world builder. There is so much to this story and so many characters that it would be impossible for me to outline it all here because that would make this about 20 pages long. This series is definitely going to need a detailed appendix in further books. But he has created a spectacular world, with rich characters, some more fleshed out than others, but all very intriguing. There is also a fascinating magic system, called Kennings. You have to risk your life to see if you are worthy and are to be blessed with a kenning and if you are you, then have to be careful how you use it, since basically the kennings run off of life force and if you use too much magic at one time you could basically drain out your entire life in one instance. I am so glad I persevered with this book. I didn\u2019t love the entire story. There were some parts I didn\u2019t like. One of the characters, who I thought for sure would be developed and play a larger role in future books, was unceremoniously disposed of. Maybe his point was to show us that no character is untouchable or safe. Kind of like another author some of us know and love\u2026I am looking at you George R. R. Martin. And I suppose that is why he has the Fintan tell the story in such a way. That was actually one of my favorite parts of the story. I thought having a bard relay the different journeys of all these people, not to mention being able to look like them, was a unique device to use. So, I highly recommend this to fantasy lovers who enjoy epic fantasy and want to become invested in a story and a new world. It might not be for everyone, but I think most people who enjoy this genre will be rewarded. If you do read it, I urge you to give it about 150 pages if you feel like you are struggling at the beginning. I certainly intend to get the 2nd book when it comes out and to think this is a book I nearly didn\u2019t finish.

Set in a world where certain members of the population are blessed with Kennings - the ability to manipulate one of the four elements, plants, or animals - although no one has discovered the sixth Kenning (animal control) yet. The six nations of the known world coexist in a tenuous peace; however, that all changes the day that the mysterious Bone Giants attack several cities along the coast. Coming from an unknown land, these warriors dressed in bones, speaking an unknown language, cut down all that stand in their path.A Plague of Giants is the first part of an epic tale. Similar to the first book in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, the book shares the journeys and battles of the land and its people, ending not at the conclusion, yet not on a cliffhanger, but rather, at a point of rest in between the parts of the whole. This story is shared in two ways within each chapter, both in present day and in flashbacks that cover the past year or so. First, the story is narrated in present day by Dervan, a scholar and historian, friend of the ruling king, and survivor of the Bone Giant attack. Willing to help his country as asked, he gets wrapped up in potential espionage and political maneuvering. From his point of view, readers are able to experience how the war has impacted the various classes of people. Additionally, he gives the story a personal connection - a way to internalize the massive events unfolding before our eyes. Dervan\u2019s primary job by order of Pelenaut R\u00f6llend (king) is to accompany Fintan, the Raelech bard, each day and record the knowledge and the tales Fintan shares with the masses on Survivor Field. A Raelech bard has perfect memory recall and the ability to transform shape into the character who\u2019s story he shares. The pelenaut believes Fintan to be a spy of the Triune Council, and wants the details of his day observed. This leads to the second method of storytelling, which is the bard\u2019s recounting of the events of the Giants\u2019 War. By taking on the personas of key figures of the war and sharing their stories, readers slowly learn about how the lands arrived in their current state. But Fintan is not only sharing this story with the reader, but with the masses of refugees, who have little knowledge of the bigger picture and totality of the war. There are a number of characters, and at first it is difficult to see any connections. However, the larger picture becomes clearer as the tales go on, eventually leading to a full view of the multi-front war with two sets of giants.It was difficult to follow along at first. Mr. Hearne just tosses the reader into his tale without any guides. Once I got used to the method of storytelling - the back and forth between the past and present - I was able to just listen and absorb. The story on whole is engrossing, made more so by the amazing narration. And although the ending is a bit abrupt (see reference to LotR above), it didn\u2019t detract from my enjoyment. This book is meant to be experienced, and I think I would have struggled reading it rather than listening to it. I had to get out of my usual mindset of taking detailed notes and trying to figure it all out, and rather just absorb and experience the massive tale.The performances of Luke Daniels and Xe Sands are phenomenal! Most of the narrative is read by Mr. Daniels. He is the primary voices of Dervan and Fintan and all male flashback/memories. Ms. Sands jumps in to share the bard\u2019s female-centric stories, and carries forward her performance to include the bard and Dervan once the flashback concludes. Both provide a massive array of accents and tones, ranging heavy and deep (Gorin Mogen, Hearthfire of Harthrad), to airy and light (Nel Kit Ben Sah, Fornish greensleeve). Both provide such a variety of inflections, emotions; their ranges wow\u2019d me. It was so easy to get lost in their storytelling, enabling me to sit back and enjoy this story.In the end, I enjoyed my time spend with Dervan, Fintan, and this fascinating new world of the Seven Kennings. While I may have struggled at times to keep up with the massiveness of the tale, once I was able to just let go and listen, I found myself deeply engrossed in the stories and characters. I look forward to finding out what happens next for the citizens of these lands.My Rating: B+Narration (both): AReview copies provided by NetGalley/Publisher (print) and Random House Audio (audio)"}, {"userName": "Kitten Kisser", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34354626-kitten-kisser", "userReview": "There are a lot of things I don't like about this book, but I think my biggest problem is how it is written. When I got to the end - The Acknowledgements - I learned from the author that writing this way was something he had in his head for a long time. \"The idea of nightly, serial storytelling....\" The problem is, it doesn't have a proper flow written in this way. Everything does start to come together, but sadly, thanks to the authors writing style I wasn't invested in any of the characters, therefore I really didn't care what happened to any of them. That right there makes a very bad book. I was listening to 'The Crown Tower' during this same time & loved the book. I thought about it all of the time & was curious as to what would happen next. In that book, I was fully invested in the characters. I finished that book & am wholeheartedly looking forward to listening to the next book in the series. This book on the other hand, I have zero interest in continuing with the series.While this novel is about giants invading various lands, it is also about unique skills or what the author calls kennings that some people are 'blessed' with. Elemental things, such as water, fire, air, & earth. A wonderful thing to earn if you feel that when you use your kenning it takes away your life. The more you demand of it, the faster you age. Therefore you are never likely to live a full life. If you are not chosen, you die even sooner. You die seeking your kenning. Naturally the majority of folks who seek their kenning have nothing to loose, nothing to live for. If they are chosen, woo hoo! If not, woo hoo death! In these situations it is hard to be happy for someone seeking a kenning. They are tools to be used up & tossed away by their various lands form of rule/government. Someone is always seeking a kenning, so they are replaced easily enough. Sure, they get more respect then the regular folks, but what a price they pay in the end.There are other things about the characters that didn't really sit well with me. Behaving in certain ways in different situations. It just didn't feel right. I couldn't connect with the way these various people behaved. It didn't seem normal. At times the language didn't flow right either. Sometimes the author got it right & the story flowed along, but then there would be that inevitable bump in the road jarring me out of the story & making me wish I could just finish the darn thing & move on to something hopefully better. One main situation in the book is resolved at the very end, so no sudden abrupt stop to the story that many authors/publishers have the nerve to call 'cliffhangers'. For me, as mentioned, I don't plan to read the next book in the series. I don't care what happens next."}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5375148-beth", "userReview": "I received this ARC copy of A Plague of Giants from Random House Publishing Group - Ballantine - Del Rey.
