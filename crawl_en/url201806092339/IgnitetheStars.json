But I\u2019m so desperate to love that I keep trying and trying but...I just can\u2019t. I absolutely adored The Lunar Chronicles, but most other sci-fi books fall short for me.Sadly, Ignite the Stars is no different. It was okay, it really was. I liked Ia, our criminal mastermind extraordinaire, but there was just something missing. (On a different note, the name keeps making me sing Rewrite the Stars from The Greatest Showman whenever I read it, so that\u2019s always a plus.)Ignite the Stars is told in three different POVs - Ia, our aforementioned criminal, Brinn, who didn\u2019t really serve much of a purpose outside of her relationship with Ia, and Knives the Flight Master at a prestigious military training school, and also the son of the General who devotes his time to hunting down Ia. When Ia is captured and sent to the academy, Knives is forced to hold her reins - in the form of a device that could stop Ia\u2019s heart within seconds. So, obviously, I shipped it. If this book was told in Ia and Knives\u2019s POVs, I probably would have given this 4 stars instead of 3, but Brinn just dragged this ship down. I skim read the majority of her chapters, because I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to care about her. Ia, however, is a bit of a whirlwind. She\u2019s reckless and brilliant and arrogant and dangerous, just how I like my heroines. Her POV was definitely the highlight of the book for me. For a debut novel, Maura\u2019s writing was really good. The only problem I had with it was the made up curse words. Every time someone said \u201cmiff\u201d or \u201cmiffing\u201d instead of \u201cfuck\u201d or \u201cfucking\u201d, I cringed so hard. There are a few other made up curses that weren\u2019t quite as bad or overused as \u201cmiff\u201d, but I, personally, find it just a little bit silly when authors invent their own curse words. Had this book been fantasy instead of sci-fi, I probably would have enjoyed it a lot more, as I always struggle with space settings, as I said earlier. I would definitely recommend this book if you\u2019re a fan of YA sci-fi books, though, as it definitely has a lot of potential, and I feel like I\u2019m going to be in the minority with my rating of it. *thank you to the publisher and NetGalley for sending me an arc*"}, {"userName": "Amy Leigh", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68872651-amy-leigh", "userReview": "I needed a good ya sci-fi and Ignite the Stars gave it to me! This book is intense and I read it in one sitting. I loved that it was written from three point of views. I'm always wondering in other books what the other characters are thinking beyond what the narrator tells us and this author gives you exactly that. I loved Ia as the main character and the character development is well written. This is a beautiful space opera and I can't wait for more! You don't want to miss this beauty!Ia is a space mercenary and is so cautious that no one knows she is a girl. Knives gets orders to capture the killer known as Ia Coche and bring her to a military training facility to reform her or lifelong imprisonment. She chooses the school of course. Her roommate Brinn is brilliant and between the two of them they are pretty much unstoppable.

That doesn't happen near as often as I would like. I'll be the first to say that I am not a big sci-fi YA fan. I can probably count on one hand how many YA sci-fi books I have read and actually enjoyed it. Not my favorite genre, BUT Ignite the Stars is certainly and most definitely the exception and I am so happy that I took the chance. The basic plot honestly reminded me of Divergent in the beginning - a girl is sent to a training \"facility\" and eventually falls for one of her instructors/teachers. Granted there are probably a lot of books that I haven't read with that same plot, but Divergent was the one to stick out for me. Having said that, the basic plot is where those similarities end and it becomes its own animal. This story had everything - a fierce heroine and a flawed/conflicted hero that were amazing characters by themselves, but when they got together: chemistry AF and delicious banter (enemies to lovers!!) that would..well..excuse the pun, but would ignite the stars. ;) And if that swoony side piece isn't enough, there's friendships, family, betrayals, loss, a twist that I SO should have saw coming (argh!!), and not 1, but 2 bad guys with very punchable faces - all wrapped into a sci-fi experience really that left me ticked that I read it so early, but also SO excited and ready for the sequel!

All thoughts are my own.)I was only a few pages into Ignite the Stars when I got the sinking feeling that I knew this story. Ignite the Starsis a very average young adult science-fiction story with a lot of familiar elements. And I mean \u2018a lot.\u2019Do you recognise any of these tropes and traits: a prickly, mercenary female character, caught and imprisoned and given a chance to redeem herself? A school-like environment built upon competition? An inappropriate love-interest that becomes an insta-love situation when said female character shows amazing skills that others don\u2019t have? Roommates who can\u2019t stand each other?They\u2019re all in here, plus more. And they\u2019re not bad things to include in a story - it just felt like it has all been done before and there wasn\u2019t sufficient depth or exploration of any of them to make me feel like I was invested in the story, or the characters.If we want to get technical, there\u2019s nothing wrong with the story or the writing style - it\u2019s alright. It\u2019s easy to read and I\u2019m sure there will people out there who really enjoy this story, especially if you're fans of Throne of Glass or Zenith.

IA was such a kickass heroine, sarcastic and spunky, while Brinn was a very relatable character I could identify with. The chemistry between the two felt organic and sincere, and I liked that the author spent a good amount of time on their friendship, which often isn't the case in YA novels. But that doesn't mean there wasn't romance! Knives was dreamy and swoon-worthy, and the scenes between him and IA were filled with sparks.The action scenes were also so amazing!!

Because not only do I really like it colour-wise, but there is a POC on the cover. All the thumbs up for that.But now, let\u2019s get to the story. Even though I needed quite a long time to get into it, I just read 3/4 of the book in one sitting because\u2026 wow. What took me so long in the beginning was that the story is told in three POVs and that each chapter is another character. That made it hard for me to get really into that character in the beginning. But the more the plot developed, the more I got to know the characters and because they all interacted with each other, it was then easy to follow their stories.Ia certainly is one fierce character. Even though she is never described as being of Asian heritage (at least I think so?), I always imagined her that way, thanks to the cover. In the beginning we already get to know her as a killer with a good heart, even though most people only see the killer and not the good heart. When she is captured and brought to Aphelion, her enemies\u2019 military academy, she tries everything to escape at first. But her brother convinces her to stay and get informations. So she stays but things do not go as planned: she finds friendship and also something more.What I liked about Ia\u2019s chapters was her development and how she herself felt it and described it. How she went from not-caring to caring-very-much. But she stays herself through it all: sassy and brave, smart and quick.The second POV is from Brinn, Ia\u2019s roommate in Aphelion. She is not exactly happy about this, but she soon finds, that it isn\u2019t all that bad, especially when Ia discovers Brinn\u2019s secret. Slowly trust and friendship blossom between the two girls and even though this friendship has its ups and downs, it is a wonderful one. Brinn is extremely clever and so the two make a great team: Brinn the mind, Ia the fighter. Where Ia is hotheaded and talks with fists rather than her mouth, Brinn is more calm and analytical.Brinn also gets a great character development: from being insecure, she learns and accepts who she is.The third protagonist is knives, the Flight Master of the academy and son to a powerful General. Who is also the general who captured Ia. He does not take any shit from Ia and knows just as well where to put a fist, if necessary. Even though the two of them are constantly at each other\u2019s throats, they too, slowly grow together. I liked his character instantly because I liked the way he thinks and the motives that get him going.But not only the characters were amazing, the plot was as well. Even though I still have not completely understood why Ia has to attend Aphelion, I am glad she did. Because so many components come together to form their story around Ia and her associates. And those plot twists? Damn. They really got to me.The whole book was fast paced, but especially the last 100 pages were intense and I could not get my eyes away from the pages. So much happened. I just wish I could read how the story goes on right now.The only thing I would have liked to see more of is the general world building. The essentials were there, but I would really like to know more about how the Commonwealth works, how they treat their colonies, who and what the slaver nations are and who exactly are the criminal associates of Ia\u2019s? And how Dark Space and normal space are interwined and work together or not?Apart from this, I just loved everything. Even though this is a debut, it did not feel like it. The writing was great and easy to read and understand. The characters were wonderful and so was the plot. What a furious debut.

OK so please just do yourself a favour and read this book. It's only publishing later this year so I guess that explains why it hadn't been hyped so much yet, BUT I'M TELLIN' YOU IT SHOULD BE HYPED because it is amazing. It is easily one of the best sci-fi novels I have ever read. Just read it.The writing is excellent. The book might be a debut, but the writing does not feel like that of a typical debut's. It's absolutely genius. It's stellar.The plot is insanely good. There's tons of chilling, adrenaline pumping action, but also a fair amount of beautiful, quieter scenes, and the whole sorry is so exciting, fun, and fast-paced. I also adore the humour, which lends itself to some awesome laugh-out-loud moments, too. Overall, the plot is just amazing.Oh! And I also have to mention the ending/climax! Without giving spoilers, let me just tell you how absolutely perfect it is. I cried, I laughed, I didn't think it was possible to love the book more, but I did. The ending is perfect in every way.But I found the world building disappointing. It is intriguing, but it's a bit confusing too. I wanted more explanations and details. It's quite limited and all over the place. \nThis girl was a child of violence. She had suffered and survived. That was a part of her, but what about the girl who had teased him five minutes ago? Where did she fit in? Was she a mirage, a mere trick of the eyes? Did that person really not exist at all?His eyes traced the elegant line of her neck as she swiveled around to face him, her eyes sparking like collapsed stars swallowing up the surrounding light. She was a dark star, a black hole in the endless sky, and if he got too close, he would surely disappear. He knew all this, but even then, he couldn\u2019t turn away from her.\n The characters are brilliantly written. Everyone is so real and human, with lots of depth and development, and the chemistry between everyone is insane, too. It's just incredible.I love the three leads: Ia, Brinn, and Knives. They're all so different but all equally compelling, and the depth and development they each get is amazing. I fell in love with all of them. They're three of the best main characters I've ever read about; Ia's arrogant but she's fierce, Brinn's insecure but she's a whizz with numbers, and Knives is tormented but passionate. I absolutely love and appreciate what they each contribute to the story.The romance!! Oh my word it's perfect. Knives and Ia start off fighting and trying to kill each other so of course I'm reading it grinning and shipping them hardcore, and the development of their relationship is stunning. I ship them so much.Female friendship!! Oh my gosh this is a female friendship to rival even Inej and Nina's. Almost. But seriously, Brinn and Ia's friendship is beautiful. They start off disliking and distrusting each other, but soon get to see the heart of the other person and what they're hiding, what they fear, and what they're fighting for. It's lovely and heart-wrenching to watch. And even though I shouldn't really say too much about the climax, it is the perfect example of girls having each other's backs. It's magnificent.\nIgnite the Stars\n is a breathtaking tale of love, friendship, and inner healing and growth. It's exciting and brilliantly written, but its characters give it its invincible heart."}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3368925-kelly", "userReview": "Ignite the Stars is explosive and smart.

They apprehend her, but instead of throwing her into prison for life, they take a gamble, thinking they can use her youth and skills to help in their fight. So instead of a prison colony, they send Ia to Aphelion, a top-secret training academy for the Commonwealth's most promising cadets.When she arrives, Ia is a reluctant student, plotting her escape every second of the day.

As the weeks pass with no escape in sight, Ia begins to realize that not every cadet is evil. The army has killed many of her own, but she's also killed many of them. In war, both sides pay a price.

One theme I kept seeing is \"Throne of Glass In Space\" and I have to say, that observation nailed it perfectly. I also did not enjoy Throne of Glass and for the same reason I found here: we have a supposedly 'tough female lead' who spends most of the book being a jerk and doing things without thinking but everything always works out. Everyone around her admires, falls in love with, or befriends her after a set of highly unrealistic situations or very deus ex machina set ups that made me want to pound my head against the keyboard, they were so obviously a plot device. Everyone else around her is vapid or clueless so you don't realize just how stupid she is. Story: Ia is a rebel known and feared throughout the star system. When she is finally captured (to nobly save some refugees, natch), she is not imprisoned/killed but instead sent to become a soldier for her hated enemy. There she will meet a hunky flight instructor and befriend a sweet but naive girl who wants to protect her people. Cue unrealistic situations.Because I have a bias for women being shown as strong through using their brain rather than clearly fabricated set ups to make her look good and 'show spirit', I'm going to be predisposed to being frustrated with the main character. And unsurprisingly here, Ia is like a hamster on a hamster wheel - looking energetic and fun to watch but not really doing anything other than pointless actions to make her look 'cute' (read: 'strong and powerful and with ingenuity'). As well, all the characters should hate her with her being so annoying but of course we have the set ups so she can 'change their opinions' about her - she's not a bloodthirsty rebel, she's altruistic and selfless!It's all so incredibly facile. A twinkie of a story that, while sweet while eating, really leaves nothing for the reader in terms of satisfaction, nuance, solid storytelling, and great characterization. There's a big audience for this kind of mindlessness - escapism for the young. So yes, Throne of Glass redux: the space version that many will enjoy and others, like myself, scoff.

I am not a sci-fi girl, or more, I didn't use to be. Then, the Illuminae files happened and I gave the genre a chance. It is books like Ignite the stars that make it worth it. After only a few pages, I was hooked. There is no break or slow time in this book, something is always happening. You can't get bored reading it, you will just want more and more til the last page is turned!The world building itself is pretty good too, even if I would have loved even more space description: there is a rich vocabulary, technological tools we can only dream ( or be afraid) of, spaceships, darkness...well everything you want to read in sci fi!Now for the characters! Ia Cocha is a great main character and her sidekicks are just as interesting! They are all a bit infuriating time to time, but it is with that you recognize good characters! Because they will make you feel with them! They just grow in depth with every page, becoming more and more complex with time.Speaking of complexity, can we talk about how this book will turn your mind? There is no good or bad side here, only shades of grey. You think you have it right, you think you know who to trust and then... you discover that it is not as simple as just having the good ones fighting the bad guys. So in the end, who can you trust?

In other words, this was a thrill to read!Ia Coche is the most feared name in the galaxy, one everyone knows and fears. When Ia Coche is finally captured, no one can believe the most dangerous rebel is a seventeen-year-old girl. The Commonwealth gives her two options: life-long sentence in a hellish prison or enrollment at the highly elicit Military Academy. When she walks into the academy, no one is ready for her, but then, she isn't there to deal with any of them. Determined to escape, she starts to work on a plan, but as the layers of intrigue behind her capture, and the real reason she's been enrolled into the school unfold, everything she ever believed comes into question. Still, she is Ia Coche, and all who stand against her will learn the real meaning of fear.This book captures and shoots off with pure adventure into the stars. Ia Coche is a true space rogue and adventurer. She is tough and will not let anyone get in her way. Her past is violent, and she has tons of blood on her hands. But even in the first chapter it's clear, she's fighting a war for those who can't fight on their own. This lone hero against all odds makes her very easy to cheer for and like, although her personality definitely has its fill of rough edges. While this story centers around Ia Coche, the other characters have their own personal tales, challenges, desires and obstacles. The books is written from several points of view, allowing each of these subplots to mold and develop as they carefully weave with Ia Coche's. There are characters to love, some to hate, and some who rock back and forth. It gives the story richness and depth, making each character grow on the reader along the way.Action is key followed closely by intrigue. Ia Coche is a teenager placed in an academy, but this is not the average teenage drama tale. There are friendships, a very light dusting of something which might be considered romance, and rivalries, but this only helps to make the academy scene more realistic. Ia Coche's battle to discover her true enemies and uncover a web of intrigue, while fighting for her freedom remain at the center of the tale\u2014bright and clear. There are emotional moments, ones which get under the skin and make Ia Coche and the others more realistic, but they perfectly balance with high tension and exciting scenes. There is never a boring or slow moment in these pages.Summed up, this is a fantastic science fiction read with a heroine to root for. Friends of space adventure, tension, political intrigue, evil plots and a heroine to take on all of them, are going to enjoy this one from beginning to end.I received a complimentary ARC through Netgally, loved it and wanted to leave my honest thoughts."}, {"userName": "Taylor", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44380946-taylor", "userReview": "Reviewed at my blog: Babbling Books\n\n\"Without the struggle, you could not rise.\"\n\nSigh. This book...my feelings are still sort of mixed on it. I think the reason for that is the whole time I was reading it felt more like I was reading a middle novel, not a starter book. So I wanted to know and love these characters and this world but I kept getting the sense like I was already supposed to know them, as if I was missing something. This book had so much potential, I just feel it didn't quite live up to it.The world the author was trying to create is an intriguing one, and I wish that I would've been able to imagine it, but honestly the descriptions were sorely lacking. I felt lost a lot of the time, trying to grasp a hold of time, place and setting not really getting where or what all was going on. Again, I think it's because the whole book read like a middle piece and not like a beginning. There was no exposition. No setting up of the initial story or how this world came to be. You get the impression this is a future version of our current world but no real idea of how it got that way, how the new politics work, the new culture, the language idioms. Things are mixed together in a way that just don't quite fit. I did enjoy the futuristic space/greco-roman vibe everything had going, but would've loved more depth to it all so I could understand it.The characters had the same problem, not enough depth. There were glimpses but not enough exploration. No true delving into backstories at all. Again, it seemed like you were already supposed to know them from the get-go. And\u00a0I can officially say that Ia is the first heroine I've read who I've hated and rooted for at the same time. While I wanted her to succeed at certain points because I admired her tenacity and unwilingness to give up, I also disliked her mean-sprited, self-absorbed personality that near the end was bordering on psychotic with her willingness to harm others. Plus, the idea that as 17-year-old girl she could battle and kill so many people almost singlehandedly seemed beyond even fantastical stretching. She is not an easy to like heroine to say the least. Honestly I would call Brinn more of the heroine for this book than Ia. She had more of a transformation and growth process, along with a defined personality change that was meaningful. And her romantic plot-line was very sweet and understated.The romance in this book isn't the main focus, but I liked it that way. This book seemed to focus more on the bonds of genuine relationship and trust, which Ia had never experienced and so her relationship with Brinn as a friend took more focus than her romantic relationship. But the chemistry between Ia and Knives develops slowly in the moments they do share together, leading to a romance that could be a really good one if it gets even more development. Knives (despite his unfortunate name) was a good character on his own, although sometimes the way he talked about his sister made me cringe a little. If there's one character I would've liked to have seen more of, it's him. His and Ia's interactions were usually funny and interesting and were the only times when most of the interesting or meaningful things would happen out so I really did enjoy those moments in the book.I was surprised that this book also contained a fair bit of unnecessary cursing. Of course it was \"veiled\" using the books different language so the word \"mif\" comes up a lot. Which is just a blanket for multiple versions of our cuss words. To be honest I just don't think that cursing adds a lot, or anything, to the text. There are so many ways for characters to express frustration, disappointment, surprise, anger, so it doesn't need to be used.Overall I still think this book has a lot of potential and I'm hoping that maybe the next book in the series will improve upon this first one. With some extra character development and greater world building I could really see this being a great series. I guess we'll just have to wait and see.\u2013 I voluntarily read and reviewed an advanced copy of this book I received through NetGalley\u00a0from Albert\u00a0Whitman & Company.\u00a0All thoughts and opinions are my own.\u00a0\u2013"}, {"userName": "Maeve", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/72706269-maeve", "userReview": "I was given a chance to read this book through my library as an advanced readers copy in exchange for an honest review, and GAHHH.

I was actually close to DNF-ing it early into the book because of how many I had. But after I got through certain parts and the action picked up, I found myself more engaged than when I started. It's not a bad story, nor is the writing terrible. Just left me with a lot of questions and needing more to really help me in understanding what was happening.\u00a0The story is told in three points of view: Ia, Brinn, and Knives. The characters overall are pretty developed and are compelling in their own ways. Ia is very interesting, but I needed the author to flush out details and explain a whole heck of a lot more with her. She just wasn't relatable nor could I understand how she became the way she was. I definitely started to care later and in random points throughout the story. But I needed so much more to understand how this girl got so many stories under her belt. Or how she learnt all of those impossible things she did in the book.I actually really liked Brinn. I didn't think I would when we first meet her. She just didn't seem remarkable or very original. In the academy, as she learns more about herself and her heritage, I enjoyed her chapters and seeing her character develop. Brinn hids her Tawny genes by dying her normally blue hair brown. She doesn't find pride in that side of her family, only shame, especially when those around her blame the Tawny for their struggles or see the refugees as criminals. I found her unique and interesting by the end of the story and definitely appreciated her all the more for her relationship with Ia.Knives... of the three, I think he's the one I like the least. He just didn't stand out to me. Nothing about him was particularly interesting. I think the one thing I enjoyed the most that had him involved was Knives's banter with Ia. They're definitely brilliant together. Other than that, I don't know how much the story would have suffered without him. Maybe that's a harsh assessment, and I don't want to leave out that I did start to like him more by the end. But if I had to wait to the end to really appreciate his presence, I don't know how much I cared for his part for the rest of the story. I do hope I like him more in any future stories.You really jump into the action. The author really didn't explain enough in the beginning for me to understand what was really happening. I got the gist as I read more but I really wanted more explained. Like how Ia became the way she is in more detail, or her crew, or who her allegiances were to specifically. I wanted to know so much more than I was told. I really think more should have been detailed in the beginning for things to make sense later.And then you have the random things that kind of stay with you. Why is there a Moon prison specifically for rapists and sexual deviants? Why would they threaten to sentence someone who didn't commit those crimes to that prison for 120 years? Why... Why did Knives call the headmaster by his first name, despite not being at remotely close to his rank?In the summary, it says that this is perfect for fans of The Lunar Chronicles. I didn't see a lot in common other than it being in space, to be honest. I mean, if you take the complex characters in space and a larger enemy, then yeah, they're similar. But beyond that, I didn't see the connection. I did, however, see similarities between Ignite the Stars and Throne of Glass. Ia is very similar to Celaena, personality- and story-wise. They both were thrusted into the life they're living, they both have to work with the \"enemy\", and they end up caring more than they'd like to admit. Plus, there's an evil force working to subject others to harsh conditions. If you like Throne of Glass, you might enjoy this book more. I definitely found myself comparing Ignite the Stars more to that series than The Lunar Chronicles.At the end of it, I think what bothered me the most was how much potential this book had. It wasn't bad and the characters were pretty cool. But I had too many questions, or something would bother me enough that I kept on remembering it. By the end, there's a new enemy, but the relationships that develop because of it just confused me. I thought I understood the reasoning of certain characters, but then I was second guessing everything when I finished the book.I would recommend Ignite the Stars, but I would take it with a grain of salt. Like I said, there's a lot of potential, and I hope future stories utilize it, but with this book, it just wasn't there for me. I will be reading any sequels, in hopes that the author explains things further. Ia is an interesting character and I want a whole heck of a lot more of Brinn.************************ARC provided via the publisher\u00a0in exchange for an honest review.************************"}, {"userName": "Vicki Zhang", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51197535-vicki-zhang", "userReview": "I received an ARC from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. In many ways, Ignite the Stars is like a mashup of many different YA novels. I found so many similarities with other books: a strong female lead who is put into an environment where everyone despises her, like in Throne of Glass; said strong female and a love interest (who also comes in the form of her instructor) is accompanied by other compatriots to fight evil, like in Divergent; a classist and racist futuristic universe where superpowers are battling for control over planets, like in Illuminae; very similar characters with the same personality and talents to the characters in Cinder. The similarities go on and on.  It almost makes me wonder whether YA novels are slowly losing creative material.Ia Cocha is a 17-year-old girl from a planet that the Olympus Commonwealth tore apart. Since then, as an outlaw, she has masterminded numerous plots to take down the Commonwealth. When she is finally captured, the Commonwealth forces her to attend the most prestigious military academy in hopes of utilizing her piloting talents for military service. She meets her roommate Brinn and her Flight Master Knives (what kind of a name is Knives), and pretends to comply with the academy's rules, slowly plotting her escape. Friendships are formed, alliances are questioned, and true enemies.Maura Milan effortlessly creates a world of injustice and strife. Ignite the Stars features characters from all different planets who are divided in the aftermath of a war. The Commonwealth greedily seizes new planets that they discover, forcefully taking in the residents, exactly like colonialism. The foreigners are safe under a refugee policy that the citizens want to remove. Blatant racism transpires against refugees from other planetary regions.The cast of characters is well-written, but not my favourite. Ia is strong and battle-hardened, with a soft side that cannot help but fight against injustice, which I like. Ia is also suppose to be sarcastic and rebellious, but she just fell flat. Knives (still cannot get over the ridiculous name) is also strong and military-wise, and supposedly a love-interest, but nothing made me click with him.The only character I really like is Brinn. Her background is complicated, she is intelligent and unique and she brings Ia out of her shell. She is constantly battling an internal war, but is determined to prove her worth. She endures character growth. She is realistic and relatable. The progression of her friendship with Ia is the only authentic character relationship.All the other of character relationships developed in a rushed and unnatural way. Although it isn't insta-love, Ia and Knives (I cackled at the name) get together very quickly, even though they are supposed to be enemies. Interactions with secondary characters, like Angie and Nero, are unrealistic and very easy to overlook. Without genuine characters, of course the dialogue is going to be stilted at times. There isn't enough depth, and the most of the characters aren't developed well enough. I feel like the book could've been slightly longer. Action scenes could do with more description, so that I know what exactly is going on. There are some scenes where I didn't understand the mental picture in my head, and there are some holes in the climax of the plot that confused me. The fast-moving plot does make the novel entertaining, and I really did enjoy that massive, unpredictable twist. However, there isn't enough happening in the novel to be absolutely convincing.The plot may not be unique, and there may be flaws in the writing, but the story-line is still compelling and interested me. Maybe it's because its a blend of a lot of my favourite YA novels, or maybe because of the surprising twist, but I did enjoy Ignite the Stars. Enough to want to pick up a sequel and hope for some improvements."}, {"userName": "Sam", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46034979-sam", "userReview": "[ God, I only wish that Einn hadn't turned out to be a total asshat.

It had space flight, a training academy, refugees, secrets, and three different characters from totally different backgrounds struggling with their identity in the unstable world. On paper, the description is so tantalizing, it's dripping with hot fudge. Somehow, the execution didn't play out in a way that felt wholly successful to me.This book's description promises Ia, the Blood Wolf of the Skies, and her struggles as she is imprisoned at a military academy. Instead, the reader is given three different POVs. All of these characters are written out as interesting, but none of them really behave to character. The badass talks about being badass and is described in narration as badass, but ultimately does nothing to secure that title for the reader. The strong female character coming to terms with her heritage is presented as a powerful, intelligent young woman comes off as a sidekick needing constant guidance, and Brooding YA Hero?Well, he's eternally a Brooding YA Hero. I'm not fond of this trope, so that's on me.There are a lot of different directions this book could have taken to make it a more original and more interesting read, but instead various subplots are pushed to the side to make way for the Grand Plot, which even the characters don't feel wholly committed to. And the Grand Plot is interesting enough - I promise! I'm just had a difficult time believing in it, because it all felt so awkwardly forced.Ignite the Stars is a book that really will appeal to a lot of readers, but don't jump in looking for too much depth and space adventure. Most of this book happens with two feet on the ground. If the characters were a bit more three dimensional and didn't feel so squished into the confines given them by the plot, I would have liked this a lot. As it was, I cringed. A lot.It's so close. So very close.But a lot of people who like YA sci-fi and bad girls gone good and Brooding YA Heroes will really like this one."}, {"userName": "Ainslee || Jest and Hearts ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56667102-ainslee-jest-and-hearts", "userReview": "This was a fantastic sci-fi!I flew through this and couldn't put it down.Do you like Sci-fi? Ruthless characters? Strong females? Betrayal? a little bit of romance? this book has all of that and more!The story is told from three perspectives: Ia, Brinn and Knives (horrible name I know). Ia, is the ruthless tyrant the government is trying to capture. Brinn is a young female who is part Tawny, which is a race that is hated. Then there is Knives who is the Generals son and also a Flight Master.The main character Ia is absolutely ruthless she is known as the Blood Wolf of the Sky and we get to see this ruthless side of her. She has had a pretty miserable life, her parents are no longer around and the only family she has left is her brother Einn. She is quite a complex character, shes ruthless but shes compassionate.. deep, deep down, she is incredibly intelligent and strong, mentally and physically. Besides Ia the full cast of characters were very likeable, at first I wasn't so sure about Brinn but she grew on me. She went from this scared little girl to a strong and intelligent female. Knives was likeable from the beginning.The story takes place mainly at a military academy where Ia has been forced to work for the Commonwealth, it was either that or death basically. While here she tries to find ways to escape, unknowingly making friends and alliances that make her question her roles. The story was fast paced and there was never a dull moment, there is lots of action, cool space gadgets and technology. During Ia's time at the academy there is a new force out in space to be reckoned with, the new enemy came out of nowhere and no one knows who is behind it. There is a pretty big twist to the book that might shock you if you don't pay attention. I figured it out and the next book is going to be so good because of this!This book was excellent and any scifi lovers out there should pick this up!I was sent a copy for review via Netgalley"}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35956604-kelly", "userReview": "This was a book I really wanted to like, but I have rather mixed feelings about. The pacing really bothered me \u2013 it felt choppy, character development felt way too long to set in, and I almost DNF\u2019d it around 25% (I didn\u2019t start really getting into it until around 30%). I understand why the author set the story up the way she did, but I think it ultimately took away from validity of the MC.  Pros: that aside, I think Milan did a great job setting up the political undercurrents of the world. She also did a great job balancing the various POVs \u2013 there weren\u2019t so many that it was overwhelming, and there was just enough to flesh out each character at various points throughout the book. Cons: Our MC is supposed to be a ruthless anti-hero with a rarely seen streak of compassion, but the first third of the book felt more \u201ctell\u201d than \u201cshow\u201d \u2013 the MC says a lot of things, with few examples to prove them. It wasn\u2019t until past the first third of the book that she started to emerge as the character she describes herself as. Overall thoughts: I\u2019m not sure if I would pick up the sequel.
