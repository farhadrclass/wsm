It served as the ultimate guidebook for her early reading years. Not only did the book lead me back to childhood favorites, all with most inspiring heroines, but introduced me to classics I'd missed liked \"Understanding Betsy.\" Whenever a friend had a daughter I'd give them the book as a gift. When I met the author at a school event; it was as though I'd met my hero, or should I say heroine?"}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1058324-amy", "userReview": "I definitley found books I'm planning to try (pre-reading for my girls). Caveat - they should be closely considered as some contained mature/sensitive topics that should be discussed vs. just turning your child loose on them. A lot of ethnic/cultural/religious inclusions as well."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1110686-amanda", "userReview": "Great Choices This book provides a great reference for choosing new reading material for growing girls.

It is copyrighted 1997 - I would love to find another, more recent book like this. I have found so many wonderful books for my daughter, from beautifully illustrated short stories and folktales to novels. Her TBR list is growing as fast as mine!"}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1892272-christine", "userReview": "I have already read many of the books listed in here but I have found some new gems as well.
