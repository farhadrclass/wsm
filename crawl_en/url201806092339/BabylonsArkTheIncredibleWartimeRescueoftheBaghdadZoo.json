What a loss the world has experienced since Lawrence Anthony has died - and most of the world has no clue.It never occurred to me that there was a zoo in Baghdad and despite knowing that the Hussein's kept exotic animals, I never once gave any thought to them until I heard of this book.The insight that Mr. Anthony had into how to address issues, whether crisis issues or not, far exceeded their application on just a war-torn zoo.In addition to relating the tales of saving the animals, Mr. Anthony revealed, literally step-by-step, his methods for success in such a way that this book is as much a problem-solving guide as it is the story of specific events.I also learned so much about the invasion of Iraq that I didn't know. The nitty gritty details of daily life for the civilians as well as the soldiers.It really is an amazing book and knowing that Mr. Anthony has passed away since completing this mission of mercy, saddens me deeply."}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50066399-diane", "userReview": "This is a fantastic book. If you read the Goodreads synopsis, you'll get the gist of the book ... but you won't really understand what these people, and animals, endured until you read the book. The courage, persistence, blood-sweat-and-tears that went into this rescue is simply amazing. So many people risked so much just to make a difference in the lives of innocent animals caught in a war zone. I was deeply touched by Lawrence's efforts, and not only his, but the locals, and the American soldiers, that did all they could to assist. At a time when this land was torn apart, a few people stood up, and changed things for the better. Magnificent. Bravo!4 Stars = It touched my heart, and/or gave me much food for thought."}, {"userName": "Kathleen", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13954899-kathleen", "userReview": "As with the author's previous book, The Elephant Whisperer, this book was superbly narrated by Simon Vance. I loved Whisperer, and also enjoyed this book (but not as much).Set in Baghdad in 2003, Lawrence Anthony recounts the restoration of the bombed and looted Baghdad Zoo. Through his first-hand perspective, we see that this hard-won success was a team effort, a cooperative. Helpers included local Iraqis, a few Kuwaiti vets, foreign conservationists (especially Lawrence), the military coalition (especially Captain Sumner), a few mercenary soldiers guarding the city, and reps from several international wildlife organizations (IFAW, Wild Aide, Care for the Wild, etc). Kudos to them all! Remembering how those first responders carried endless buckets of water from the canal to the cages for dehydrated animals, I wish I could buy them all a cold one! This is a heartwarming, inspiring, and informative account. Sometimes depressing. It's also interesting and thought provoking. Quibbles: Some off-topic digressions and sporadic sequence breaking\u2014 skipping around in time when the author reflects back on something. (It was hard to keep track of time, but I think Lawrence Anthony stayed in Baghdad working freely for the animals for four uncomfortable months. When he left, the animals were recovering nicely and reconstruction engineers had rebuilt the zoo, giving it back to the city.)Having followed this memoir, I now want to visit Al Zawra Park, home of the Baghdad Zoo. I want to see the animals I read about, like the dogs who protected the lion cubs during the war, and the terribly abused brown bears, old blind Saedia, Wounded Ass (healing nicely), and Last Man Standing. Much as I cared about the plight of the long-suffering animals, I also cared about how the author portrayed life in post-war Baghdad, with looters and shooters, with starvation-level poverty and intense fear of Ba'ath party reprisals. This memoir put the televised Shock and Awe scenes in a personal context. And I grew to despise Saddam Hussein and his sons, Uday and Qusay. I was happy to see their abandoned animals rescued from their palace menageries: starving lions, camels, bears, ostriches, monkeys, etc. Interesting segment on the prized Arabians.For more details of the events depicted in this book, see my reading status updates.

The few remaining animals at the Baghdad Zoo not killed or stolen by local looters were in grave condition and upon arrival Anthony considers whether it wouldn't be most humane just to shoot them all. But instead, Anthony decides to use the restoration of this Zoo as his personal \"line in the sand\" and attempt to save all the animals in whatever way was necessary.At this point, it would be easy for an author to come off as cocky or single handedly responsible for all future good that would come. Anthony doesn't do this ever. Instead he shows how the saving of each individual animal was the result of several individual's collective efforts including the prior Zoo staff, the American military and civilians who walked five miles a day dodging gunfire just to slog water to thousand pounds beasts one bucket at a time in 115 degree heat for the entire day. The small victories accomplished collectively are equally offset by the looters who continue to plague the Zoo. Even the soldiers who personally donated their own money and supplies become upset when looters steal the sheep they'd purchased on the street specifically to feed the lions discovered at the Palace. It took awhile but eventually more organized and financially fit organizations got involved in the saving of the Baghdad Zoo and the Zoo was turned over to the Iraqi people once more. Despite being pulled from his familiar Bush, Anthony proves that convictions can cross international borders and familiar lands. At this work's end you are left with a broader sense of Anthony's beliefs and it never sounds preachy. This work combines both humans and nature in...well, the way it IS all connected."}, {"userName": "Ilsa Bick", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2842442-ilsa-bick", "userReview": "Conservationist and Earth Organization founder Lawrence Anthony died in March at the age of 61. An insurance and real estate exec turned animal saviour, Anthony came to world attention in 2003 when, alarmed about what might be happening to the capital city\u2019s zoo animals, he rushed to Iraq shortly after the American invasion. When he arrived, only a few weeks into the war, he discovered the zoo savaged by combat fire and ransacked by looters. The majority of the animals were gone, either killed by weapons fire, butchered by the city\u2019s inhabitants for food, or removed to be sold on the black market. Although some American soldiers tried to keep the few remaining, highly traumatized animals alive\u2013a pride of lions, a Bengal tiger, a terrified badger that had managed to burrow itself deep into the ground, and one nearly blind bear that fought off looters\u2013their duties lay elsewhere, and the American military had yet to understand, much less sanction, rescue operations in the middle of an ongoing conflict. Enter Anthony, a man who\u2019d already rescued a herd of rogue wild elephants on his Zululand game reserve. Through his energy and ceaseless efforts, these animal\u2013as well as a pride of Hussein\u2019s lions and his herd of prized Arabian horses\u2013survived. Eventually, the US got into the act, and today, the Baghdad Zoo\u2019s been rebuilt into what is reportedly the best in the Middle East. Whatever you think about zoos, this is a worthwhile read, though not an easy one. If you aren\u2019t moved to tears by these animals\u2019 suffering, you have no heart.

I read about Lawrence Anthony and this book in a Sunday paper magazine in a pub and I knew I had to read it. I had no idea that there even was a Baghdad zoo (or a Kabul zoo for that matter), I suppose because I just didn't think about it. But that now makes me feel almost guilty after reading about what happened to these places and the animals in them that count on humans every day for their health and well-being.I am no fan of war, and I don't really know if the American invasion of Iraq helped more than it hurt, but it was so good to see that among all the awful fighting, the animals brought out something in common among soldiers and citizens, Westerners and Iraqis, and that's the fact that many people have enough of a heart to care what happens to animals just as much as they care about people, which is as it should be.Further to the great animal rescue story, some value lies in the fact that Western readers of this book will see Iraqis as normal people. After what we see on the news, I think it's really important for everyone to realise that the Iraqis are just people like everyone else and all they want to do is live their lives without such constant threat and fear. At the same time, no one in this book is perfect, including the soldiers, but you get to see a lot more about the people involved rather than the war that they are in the midst of."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna", "userReview": "This book practically made me weep with such sadness. I've read one other book by Lawrence Anthony, who is a conservationist. He runs a game reserve in South Africa to protect many animals. In this book, he decided to travel to Baghdad, war torn and still unsafe, to save the animals that have been abandoned in the zoo. The animals were starving and horrific shape. That was so sad.The author rose to the challenge and tried to save them. This was such an inspirational story. Kind hearts speak volumes and can move mountains."}, {"userName": "Jessie Frederick", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44760832-jessie-frederick", "userReview": "I read The Elephant Whisperer a few months back and fell in love. I've now read Babylon's Ark, and that love has only grown. I am dying to read The Last Rhinos now. Lawrence Anthony is not a \"writer\" by any means. There's a ruggedness to his works that confirms that his first focus is conservation and maintaining his nature reserve, Thula Thula. But Lawrence Anthony is a storyteller. And an incredibly gifted one at that. Having read two of his books now, I am in awe at how well he takes readers through these significant experiences of his life. It's a talent I dream of possessing.As for Babylon's Ark, it would do our world some good if everyone were to read and take to heart the message here. For starters, it is phenomenal that Anthony managed to survive for months in war-torn Baghdad. I don't think I have the bravery to do something like that, regardless of how passionate I felt. It's admirable. Anthony vividly describes living in Baghdad; his depictions really hit home just how bad it was after we invaded Iraq and overthrew Saddam. Bedlam is a good word for it.Then add to the fact that there are helpless animals trapped there, this takes the emotional reach to a new level. It never occurred to me, not once, that there may be a zoo in Baghdad with animals that were all but forgotten during this period of unrest. It's heartbreaking to think that this was never widely covered by the media, that humanitarian aid would have never happened had Lawrence Anthony not made a choice to act. God bless a man who uses his resources for such infinite good.He makes so many good points here. What are we if not compassionate? What are we doing if not acting on behalf of our planet and ALL of its living creatures? What does it say about our species that we are so passive about the health of our world? These are big questions that need answers. It frustrates me to no end that I feel in such a small minority when it comes to welfare of others species. I pray that our world wakes up before it's too late.Lawrence Anthony was a good man. It is a shame that he's no longer with us to spread awareness and bring about change. I know he's an inspiration for me. I encourage everyone to read his books and truly absorb the message he worked to spread - that there comes a point where you have to draw a line in the sand and say \"it stops here.\""}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5346734-linda", "userReview": "I did not enjoy this as much as Elephant Whisperer, but I can still recommend it. There are a few pages that seemed to be a \"cut and paste\" from Elephant Whisperer, but that is my only complaint. The story is compelling and the writing is clear.

Make a donation to a charity? Volunteer at a local shelter or sanctuary? Perhaps assist with rescues? How about camping yourself in the middle of a war-torn region with the minimum of resources and a lot of gunfire? That is exactly what one man, Lawrence Anthony, did.This book tells the remarkable story of Lawrence who decided to prove a point about the value of wildlife by venturing into war-torn Baghdad to save the deserted animals at the zoo. It would have been far easier to shoot those animals on the spot when he arrived to put them out of their misery, but this was not why he was there. He was there to say that the callousness of humans against nature and animals has gone too far and that those animals deserve life and respect.Anthony Lawrence is an engaging storyteller and if I did not know better I would think that some of the events that happened were fiction. I must admit that I have very little knowledge of the situation in Iraq before the war so it was interesting yet appalling to read about some of that too. It gives a backdrop as to how animals could be relegated to such deplorable conditions. Saddam Hussein, his administration and his family reigned terror on their people and this reflected in how the animals were treated.Another fascinating aspect of the book was the ethics of animal conservation. Anthony Lawrence states that theory can be nice but when faced with practical reality you have to be \"pragmatic\". He was referring specifically to some conservationists' objections to using donkeys as meat for the lions. The final chapters bring the clashes of various agencies and ideologies to the fore - should captive animals be set free? Should animals be considered property or cultural \"assets\"? What is the place of zoos and what compromises can be made?From my point of view, there is a real dilemma in killing animals to feed carnivorous beings like lions. You're damned if you do and damned if you don't. But there is absolutely no need for humans to do so to feed themselves as they did in this book. I also did not understand the arbitrary nature of the conservationists wanting to save the horses from Arabian stock but not 'regular' horses. This is putting an anthropocentric rationale as to which beings to save purely on their economic value and heritage rather than their inherent right to life.Overall, this is a very engaging book from a pure storytelling point of view. I have nothing but admiration and esteem for people who will risk their lives to assist those in situations of hardship and exploitation. It was a very thought-provoking story but in my opinion, falls short in the solutions offered."}, {"userName": "Brittany", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/92397-brittany", "userReview": "This book tells the fascinating story of a conservationist from South Africa who decided to save the Baghdad Zoo in the middle of the Second Gulf War. He sweet-talked his way into Kuwait, bludgeoned and bonhomie-d his way from there in Iraq with a rented Toyota and two Kuwaiti zoo workers. The story is stunning. Unfortunately, though Lawrence Anthony has many gifts, writing is not one of them. (Hence the presence of the co-author). The book's quality of writing, pacing and language are extremely uneven. It wanders between a charming story, told exactly as you would hear it over cold beers, to a cliched action-adventure novel. Fortunately, the heart of the book, and the amount that Anthony cared for the animals in peril and his gratitude toward anyone who helped them (even misguided helpers) shines through and makes you, if not overlook, at least be a tad more tolerant of the book's flaws.I have always had a problem with people who begrudge help given to non-humans in crisis situations. These are the people that believe all the humans must be safe and happy first, then we can worry about the animals, the environment, and the rest of the globe. This book, for the first time, has helped me articulate what is wrong with that thought-process. The last five pages of the book devolve into a monologue on how humans treat the planet. It's all true of course; and also exactly what any conservation-minded person could sit down and hack out in two hours. But the value of this book lies in the amazing true story, and in the analogy drawn between the neglect of the zoo's animals and the outright looting of the zoo, and the way humans treat the Earth."}, {"userName": "Andrew Pender-Smith", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60746888-andrew-pender-smith", "userReview": "Lawrence Anthony's journey into war-torn Iraq to save zoo animals in danger of dying through neglect and starvation is an inspirational story of compassion and courage.

Hundreds of the zoo's former inhabitants had been taken and eaten, or killed in the crossfire. The remaining animals were starving and dehydrated, with the first thought that they were so far gone they should be put down. But Lawrence persevered, and rescued other animals from the war torn area. Eventually he was able to hand back a functioning zoo to the Iraq people, and hopefully start them on a path to conservation.I won't say much more about the actual story, because you need to read it to believe it.

Unfortunately this is one book that I wish that I hadn't tracked down and had just let it stay to the side to tempt me with its promise of a good read. Although the authors did mean well for the book itself it basically felt less of a rescue attempt of the zoo and her war-beleaguered animals and more an attempt for the author Lawrence Anthony to explain why he was a conservationist and/or the growth of himself as he is faced with having to learn to be like the animals living day-by-day in hesitancy. Parts of the book and his thoughts were repeated over and over to the reader while even though they are valid points I want to know about the actual rescue attempts, the running of the zoo and how as a group they overcame their differences but instead we get just the viewpoint of one man. And although we do get a little bit of an overview of the information mentioned above that I wanted it wasn't enough since it felt like it was just a bit of a taste of the more important considered moments that the Baghdad Zoo faced in its learning to re-stand on its own two feet. Even though the reader gets to feel through the pages the Luna Park raid and the saving of the Arabian blueblood horses from the Abu Ghraib stables there is hints by the author that there were even more raids on other personal zoos and parks although no mention was made of those within the pages themselves. Otherwise even with the lack of information that is given to the reader about the actual full scope of the save of the zoo, the reader is given a chance to understand some of the more amazing Iraqi people who came to the front to help their people get their zoo back and also the hellish nature that not only did Saddam put his own people through but also the effects that they carried onto the animals that were considered below them. Thus the book is a capture of gross neglect on all aspects and the struggle to bring back normalcy to a people who probably have no true idea of what that truly can mean. For those who are interested in battle stories this is a great book to get the reader in to see the war from a neutral civilian side but from an animal side there could have been more to write about. But if you choose to read the book then I would suggest ignoring and not reading the last chapter unless you want a scolding talk on how we should better the world and have more heart for those that live in it no matter what their designation in the kingdoms may be and that again the author hoped that he was able to prove that he was made of the finer stuff to make his own last stand for what he believes."}, {"userName": "Kristi", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70727847-kristi", "userReview": "Babylon\u2019s Ark, by Lawrence Anthony and Graham Spence, is one of the few non-fiction books I have read that have turned out to be more interesting, more hair raising, and deeper than any fiction book I have ever read. Lawrence Anthony recounts his memories of naively throwing himself head first into the middle of the 2008 Iraq war to try and save a zoo with some frozen meat and a rental car. Lawrence had heard about the Baghdad Zoo being looted and trashed by both the Iraqi\u2019s and American\u2019s, so he out of the blue decided that he would fly to Iraq, a war torn country, and save it. As smart as he was, he could have never prepared himself for the atrocities that bestow him when he reached the zoo. After all, it was just on the line of battle between two fierce and ruthless competitors. And how hard could it be to save a silly zoo? Babylon's Ark is an exciting rollercoaster of a book, for readers who enjoy animals, humor, and adventure. it had me laughing and crying throughout the entire book. Lawrence Anthony had me really questioning myself and my decisions. \"Was I doing enough for others?\" Here was a man who put his life on the line for a couple of animals, and my thought of giving back was donating old clothes to goodwill. Lawrence Anthony and Graham Spence are two of my favorite writers ever.

It's very much a great story that is well written and reinforces valuable lessons about conservation, sustainability, and how military action impacts the lives of not just humans but animals in a war zone. Lawrence Anthony and I almost overlapped in Iraq, but I did visit some of the locations that he talks about and probably drove by the Baghdad Zoo a hundred times without ever knowing it was there. Baghdad was not a nice place in 2003-2005 time period and I can certainly sympathize with his safety concerns and the plight that he faced. I also thought the parts about Soldiers smuggling him weapons and other goods that he needed just to keep the animals safe and alive was interesting because I may have known . . . ahem, *cough* sorry, heard, I may have heard about that sort of thing going on from time to time."}, {"userName": "Grace I", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71331128-grace-i", "userReview": "This soul wreaching book is an inspiring story of a man from South Africa who goes to a war filled city in Iraq to do the impossible an save a zoo that has been destroyed by bombs and looters.

This one man's battle to save the remaining animals that were not stolen or killed in the zoo is an amazing documentation of courage, compassion, and determination. Lawrence Anthony has a big heart and an impressive amount of \"liver,\" so to speak. ;)I was struck by many things in this book - first the quick degradation of humanity in a situation where law and order has gone out the window. So many people rely on the innate good nature of mankind to somehow overcome and make our own peace, yet as soon as the police and established enforcement were gone in Baghdad, theft and vandalism took over. Left to our own devices, we are a sick sad species, bent on taking for ourselves at the expense of others. If you think your country would do anything less once the law was dispelled, you are mistaken. It makes me think of all the riots that have taken place in U.S. history. The inclination of the majority is to pillage and loot rather than organize and construct. It's no wonder the world is being increasingly destroyed. We are innately screwed up.This book also showed me the hopeful side of humanity though - those willing to take a stand and brave the odds to bring order and safety back. Those courageous Iraqis who worked so hard alongside Anthony were an inspiration and an honorable representation of the human race. The risks all of them took to help the helpless should be lauded by everyone as an act of the utmost heroism.There is so much frustration in this book - difficult to read at times as you experience yourself the sinking hope and exhaustion those few stubborn men (and women). But through it all they endure and ultimately succeed in their efforts. I liked this book because of the insight into both the lightness and the darkness of humanity, as well as tangibly real descriptions of situations that make it easy to imagine you're there. Anthony also keeps things interesting by interjecting little snippets of his own history and other people's experiences into the flow of things. The ending turns into a big lecture on global warming and the destruction of the planet, but I guess that's to be expected. And really, even if you are reluctant to run after the green bandwagon, you cannot deny that our planet does need our help. If not the weather (which it may very well be too difficult to change) the life we are continuing to mow down and extinguish (often permanently). We may like to think that this world is too big for measly old us to make a dent in, but that same logic is what made the bison and passenger pigeons go from populations of millions to extinction (or the verge of it for the bison). It is important also, however, not to forget that people should not be ignored as we try to improve things. Just like Lawrence has to make sure the Iraqi workers were fed first, we should not put such a priority on ecological improvements that the poor and desperately starving are trampled or further impoverished by those efforts. There has to be a balance of compassion.Thanks, Anthony Lawrence, for passing on your experience to the rest of us.

Anthony was able, by persistence, to get himself permission to enter Iraq on what was originally to be a fact finding mission to evaluate the conditions and determine what could be done. The conditions he found were far worse than he'd expected and the mission turned into an effort to save the lives of as many as possible. Initially operating on less than a shoestring budget, and more often the goodwill of American servicemen, he worked with the Iraqi zoo staff to restore the Zoo to a national treasure and turn control of the Zoo back over to the Iraqis. Fascinating account. From his initial assessment that killing all the animals might be the most humane action to pride in what was accomplished in the thriving collection of animals, this has a feel good sense about it. He spent six months living in a war zone with the trauma and fear, yet his focus was the welfare not only of the animals but the Iraqi zoo workers who risked their own lives to show up every day. The only downer for me was the last chapter in which he pontificates about what man is doing to the planet and how we need to wake up and change our ways.

I read his first book about how he created his reserve for elephants and wildlife after taking it away from the poachers. Knowing that he had done that already, I was surprised in this book when he says that after hearing the news about the Baghdad war and the effects of the zoo, that he felt that for once he had to take action instead of sitting around! After knowing what he already had accomplished, I don't think anyone can accuse him of failing to take action.This book provided interesting details of Baghdad during the war and also the incredible fight for survival of the zoo. There are some horrific stories of animal abuse in the book, which was hard to read. I can only imagine what it must have been like to see this first-hand. Mr. Anthony, the American soldiers who bent the rules a bit here and there, and the Iraqi people who helped him, despite the fact that it put their own lives in danger, all did an incredible job for the animals."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2860910-linda", "userReview": "When a friend recommended this book, it sounded like a book that I'd enjoy. Indeed I did enjoy it, and learned more about what life was like in Iraq after the fall of Baghdad. The South African author went to Baghdad to save animals that were left in the destroyed Baghdad Zoo. What he found was hard to believe. His heroic effort to bring life back to the small percentage of animals that survived the war was amazing. I found myself horrified and fascinated at the same time. This was a good read, that kept me going, wanting to find out how the zoo rescue progressed. In the last chapter Anthony tells of an organization he has founded, the Earth Organization, which will work to save our earth and the human race from extinction. He closes with these words: \"But succeed we must, and we have to start somewhere. So much of our world has been brutally wrested from us; we now have to say enough. No more. Perhaps if enough individuals find out what is actually going on for themselves and start doing something about it, then maybe we can stave off the fast-advancing crisis and create a beautiful, healthy, livable planet where all life flourishes and man is free to rise to greater heights.\" Hear, hear!"}, {"userName": "Melle", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/85352-melle", "userReview": "At first, I was not going to fall in love with the late Mr. Lawrence Anthony and his possibly paternalistic, white-savior attitude toward the Indigenous peoples and animals of South Africa and his cavalier, daring, devil-may-care attitude and Rhett-Butler-esque weakness for what-could-be-a-lost-cause in Iraq, but Simon Vance's (always) flawless reading had me a little bit smitten. This story is peppered with self-deprecating and painfully sharp humor, adoring and generous words of praise and respect for each of the parties who helped Mr. Anthony save animals in war-torn Baghdad, and this sweetly endearing, indomitable spirit devoted to respect for animals but especially animals in a crisis. This book is a poor choice for commuter audio (hello, tears), but it's an important story and very well-told and should be widely known. Would be a great choice for people who love books like Ann Bausum's Sergeant Stubby, Michael Morpurgo's War Horse, Rebecca Frankel's War Dogs, and Terri Crisp's No Buddy Left Behind. More than that, this is an important book about conservation and environmentalism and about the interconnectedness of all life on this terrestrial ball. Easily, a four-and-a-half star book."}, {"userName": "Claudia", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70211-claudia", "userReview": "I was introduced to Anthony with his better-known book, THE ELEPHANT WHISPERER, and it helped me understand Jodi Picoult's new novel.This one, written first, is equally compelling in a whole different way. Anthony heard about the Baghdad Zoo being threatened after the second Iraqi war, and decided to go...to see what needed to be done. That visit turned into an extended stay, turned into making relationships with American military leaders and soldiers, with mercenaries, with crooks and looters. With Iraqi citizens who were as horrified with the treatment of the animals as Anthony was.This book is a chronicle of his struggles to rescue animals from nasty situation, from Saddam's own family compounds, and from his Arabian horse herd. Anthony meets folks along the way who show the best and the worst of the human heart, but in the end, he and his colleagues DID save some animals and raised awareness.The end of the book is a monologue reflecting on what we are doing to our fellow creatures, and to our world.This world lost a passionate voice for conservation when he died recently.

Fortunately, it is a mostly inspiring story, filled with good guys at every turn. It's written in an engaging style with no politicizing, the animals always at the forefront, and it's wonderful to see people who do care. The worst part is reading about how brazen and damaging the looters are, literally taking anything that is not nailed down (and even then) at all times of day and night. I was about ready to shoot them myself. I cheered when they shut down a horrendous private menagerie full of neglect. While there are a few painful instances of recently-rescued animals being stolen, for the most part, all of the animals are saved from the brink of death and make a flourishing comeback. The crowning jewel was when they found and secured some of Saddam's prized Arabian herd. How did I miss literally ALL of these stories as they were happening?"}, {"userName": "Pamela", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1094650-pamela", "userReview": "There are those of us who wish to change the world, even in a small way, and maybe we make small contributions, but mostly we feel overwhelmed by what we are up against.

Martin Luther King, Mother Theresa, Harriet Beecher Stowe are some examples. And there are more.

U.S. soldiers\u00a0had taken\u00a0the time to help\u00a0care for the remaining animals, and the\u00a0zoo's staff had returned to work in spite of the\u00a0constant firefights.
