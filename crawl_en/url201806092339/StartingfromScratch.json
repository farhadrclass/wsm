Yes, that's right, Brookings. The year will become important in a few sentences. I think I enjoyed the novel more than the average reader because of the setting. There are a few notable items to highlight in the book: (1) There's a shoutout to Mr. Hovey and Mr. Walder, two of the best English teachers ever. (2) Local haunts appear, but under different names (Casper's is cleverly disguised as \"Jasper's\", but their tortellini remains the same. (3) The story is actually pretty compelling, too, so it isn't just fun for locals. However, there is a glaring issue that no book review can ignore (even one of my quick little rants). The book takes place in 1996, yet people are continually ordering fried chicken from the Arctic Circle. Two major issues: the Arctic Circle was long out of business by 1996, and no one in their right mind would go to the Arctic Circle and order anything other than a burger."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3121849-jennifer", "userReview": "A slowcooked comfort of a book--this is a story that takes its time, and is better for it.Equal parts a study in grief, a celebration of family, and the reality of growing up, reading this book was like a dining experience in which the chef suggests something off the menu that completely hits the spot. Best of all, the ending manages to be satisfying without the bittersweet, purposefully leaving room for the reader to take hold of what happens after the last page.It's so dense; there is as much light as there is darkness, and through it all, the author skillfully encapsulates emotions and interactions that deeply resonate:\"This is how people live,\" Olivia said out loud, and felt, not for the first time, that her family had not remotely prepared her to grasp the brokenness of the rest of the world. (252) Olivia waited until the familiarity of each shape had hurt her as much as it could, until there were no surprises left in the generous bottom loop of a g or the sight of all those f's and h's, t's and l's leaning like top-heavy trees over lesser letters that crouched below-- the vowels especially vulnerable, flattened in the breeze, utterly dependent on context for their identity.

I am ambivalent by this book. At times I wanted to pick it up and read about where it was heading. At other times I didn't even want to pick it up as I found it so irritating. Focusing on an able academic family and our main character, Olivia, the youngest in the family, is shattered when her mother dies suddenly and unexpectedly. Supposedly she can't cope with this loss and part of the story, which I could not believe in, is that Olivia has just successfully completed her PhD but she does not tell the the family that she has completed the degree requirements, and they continue harangue her to complete all her work towards her PhD, weeks after she had succeeded. Olivia decides her healing will come from trying to fill the role of her mother through cooking and continuing with a cooking newsletter that her mother had established. Unfortunately she is so lacking in confidence that her character seems more like that of a teenager rather than a postgrad student.

What happens after she goes home and gets \"stuck\" for a while due to her grief and her inability to get along with her siblings is fascinating. She really comes into her own and her relationship with her siblings and her father improve tremendously throughout the book. There is also (of course) a family secret that she comes to find out.

The street names and places throughout the book are places I have fond memories of, where else is there a touchdown Jesus? Many characters in the book share the names of people I knew in real life, maybe it was coincidence but the familiarity made me enjoy the book more. Overall I felt the story was OK but not great.

Once Olivia has someone other than herself to focus on -- Mrs. McKinney, her pregnant sister, her famous-but-flawed sister, Meals On Wheels job -- her grief from the loss of her mother and best friend begins to move to the background of her life and allows her to begin the move forward into the future. The coincidences that put Olivia in the house that connects her mother, her sister and two strangers was a bit of a stretch, but this is fiction, after all, not really life. The one issue that sort of grated on me was that everyone seemed to accept that 2 months of grieving an unexpected death was sort of the limit? Really? And Olivia's father, who has lost his wife of 30+ years, is among those intolerant of Olivia's struggle and yet, I've known spouses that took years to recover from such a loss. Moving on is often a heart-wrenching struggle, yet everyone in this novel seems to have mastered their grief, except Olivia.
