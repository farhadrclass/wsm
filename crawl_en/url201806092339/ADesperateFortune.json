The diary was owned by Mary Dundas, the daughter of a Jacobite exile.After her mother died, Mary was sent by her father to live with her aunt and uncle in France. At twenty-one, her brother comes for her, ostensibly to take her to his home. Instead, he involves Mary in a Jacobite intrigue, where she is asked to pose as another man's sister. The man is being sought by the English for his involvement in a scheme to supply much-needed funds for King James and his supporters in exile after the '15. The man's bodyguard is the enigmatic and forbidding Highlander, Hugh MacPherson.As with most of Susanna Kearsley's stories this one is in dual timelines. The past set in 1732 (and mostly in France) is told via the diary as Sara deciphers its content. Unlike most of Ms Kearsley's stories though, there is no supernatural, paranormal, time travel or timeslip elements at all. The historical story here, as often happens in dual timelines, did end up the more interesting and entertaining thread. However, both romances with Sara and Luc Sabran in the present, and Mary and Hugh in the past, were delicious. An added aspect to Sara and Luc's relationship is Sara's Asperger's Syndrome. Though I've read many books with the hero having this syndrome, this is the first time I've read a heroine with AS. Ms Kearsley does a convincing and remarkable job of depicting the heroine's 'shortcomings' and particular idiosyncrasies.The beginning is really quite slow. But the story picks up pace, ending on a high. A slightly uneven read, but with an ending that was almost perfection, it's impossible not to forgive the slow beginning. There is nothing to fault as per usual in the meticulous research and artful story-telling, though. The notes at the end of the book are not to be missed. Ms Kearsley tells how she was inspired to write this story, and the real Mary Dundas on whom the story is based.Very, very few authors can write romance in that subtle, understated way that conveys by simple words and gestures the emotions and tenderness of a couple's growing love. Susanna Kearsley has this down to a fine art. Which leads me to my favourite scene, near the very end with Hugh, Mary and an equipage. Utterly captivating.Though not in quite the same class as \nThe Winter Sea, \n \nMariana\n or \n The Rose Garden,\n overall, \nA Desperate Fortune\n is definitely worth reading. Just don't give up if it doesn't grab you at first. The payoff will come.Recommended for readers who enjoy romantic historical fiction, straight historical fiction and stories set in dual timelines.Steam: 1.5ARC courtesy of Sourcebooks (Landmark) via NetGalley"}, {"userName": "Heather K (dentist in my spare time)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13070326-heather-k-dentist-in-my-spare-time", "userReview": "*3.5 stars*I love Susanna Kearsley, and I have really enjoyed almost everything she has written. This book feels strongly like a Susanna Kearsley book, but it is a little different than most. While it has the duel storyline, the Scottish themes that she so often uses, and the romance, this book, unlike others, had no time-travel/time-slip elements. Though I usually enjoy those light paranormal elements in her stories, I think that this book worked well without them. I wish I could give this book two totally separate ratings. In fact, I wish that half of the story didn't exist altogether. It isn't that the part set in present day is bad, it just paled in comparison to the story told in the past. The main characters from the 18th century, Mary Dundas and Hugh MacPherson, were an epic couple. Their story is told very elegantly and over a long period of time, and in an extremely subtle way. This isn't your typical historical romance couple, folks. In this book, the Jacobite history plays an enormous role in the story, and the romance is something that seems to develop almost on the back burner. The clandestine actions, the lies and the pretending, made this story very compelling, and, during which, we get to see Mary very slowly change her opinion of Hugh from a stoic, unattractive, and intimidating Highlander to the greatest man she has ever known. Both of these characters had deep, deep baggage, and to see them come together and trust each other was lovely. Very few writers could have created such an compelling couple, and I wish we could have followed Mary and Hugh on to more adventures at the end of the book, a la Outlander.The present-day couple were much less interesting for me. Though Sara's story of having Asperger's Syndrome was interesting, I didn't feel much chemistry between her and Luc. Every time their storyline came up, I felt like I was in a rush to move past it and back to Mary and Hugh. I was much less invested in Sara and Luc, though I did like reading about the side characters of Luc's ex-wife and son. I mostly found Sara and Luc's page time dragging on, and it made the book feel much longer than it was. Though this isn't my favorite Susanna Kearsley book, I'm still always impressed by her ability to craft an extremely well researched and subtle story. I can't wait to see what she does next. **Copy provided in exchange for an honest review**"}, {"userName": "Tadiana \u2729Night Owl\u263d", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8734459-tadiana-night-owl", "userReview": "Susanna Kearsley does another of her patented dual timeline novels, this one with computer programmer and amateur cipher-breaker Sara, a British woman with Asperger's, staying in France while trying to crack the cipher that Mary Dundas wrote her journal in, during 1732.

Both of them find romance in unexpected places.There were some nice parts to it, like the MC with Asperger's and the descriptions of code breaking, as well as some interesting historical background and research (the part of the afterword about the real-life Mary Dundas was heart-wrenching), but overall it was So.

The present day involves a young woman named Sara Thomas, a computer programer with an ability to solve number games, codes, and cyphers. Sara is hired, through a friend, by a Parisian author to decipher a diary written in unknown code. A diary that holds secrets much differently than anyone expected. Sara likes working in the beautiful country of France. She becomes attached to her neighbors, and despite the obstacles and blessings of her living with Asperger's Syndrome, Sara manages to discover much about her own self and what is truly home.The diary in the story segues Kearsley's timelines quite nicely. The diary is written and encrypted in the 1730's by a twenty-one year old Mary Dundas. Herein, Mary writes of alleged monetary deception by a man she would end up traveling with, a bankruptcy of an economy, the continuing Jacobite cause, long lost family, severe political unrest, and the mercurial nature of love. Mary is thrust into the company of a possible embezzler, Jacobite spies, a Highland woman serving as a kind traveling companion, and a fierce Highland protector. Mary embarks on a journey to reach the exiled King James' protection and hopefully sympathetic ear.I love the storyline written about someone with Aspergers. Sara's character is written well, respectfully, and true to life. Beautifully done.The running theme throughout the story felt very bold, yet simple. Home is where we chose to make it, even when our story takes a detour for the worst or people tell us who we are, where we are going. Sara was told she could not have normal relationships. In her mind, Aspergers defined who she was and while strongly reinforced, she lived, in the best way I can describe, as resolved. In the same manner, Hugh MacPherson, a 1700s Highlander, stripped from all he cared for on this earth. Further, making choices that darkened his next choice, until he could no longer recognize the man he had become. Resolved in his choices, as he saw no other path.Its easier to believe the bad stuff about yourself. But it is also the influence of only one that can pepper your worldview for the best. My only complaint, if you could call it that, was the slower but necessary start to the story. By the time Mary and her companions set out, I was hooked.Lastly, if you haven't read any of Kearsley's other stories and you love to mix your historical fiction with present day, paranormal, adventure, romance, and/or time shift or time slip*, or all of the above? Get thee to a bookstore or e-reader near you!(*A time slip is what Wikipedia calls it. I had to look it up, but I digress...)Many thanks to Netgalley for the review copy of this title.*****Jacobites, historical fiction, and adventure.

And it's beautiful and wonderful and all the good things about a book that makes you keep coming back to it over and over. Susanna Kearsley is an auto-buy author for me. When a new book of hers comes out, I try to pick it up as quickly as possible and usually devour it in an afternoon. All of her books blend the past and the present in such a way that you feel like you are stepping into the shoes of the characters and experiencing everything that they do.A Desperate Fortune follows the growth of two women: Sara, an English woman who struggles with the day to day challenges of living with Asperger's in a society that increasingly demands extroversion and conformity and Mary, a young woman who grew up in France during the Jacobite revolution and finds herself at the center of a covert operation that goes bad quickly.I absolutely adored Sara. She wants desperately to be normal and she goes with the \"Fake it till you make it\" mentality when dealing with others. She quit her most recent job because it forced her to work with others instead of working alone which she prefers. After she is given a cipher to crack, Sara is invited to work for an author who has found a very curious diary. The diary is that of Mary Dundas and is written entirely in code. It is supposed to depict the life of an ordinary girl in France but instead, it's the story of a great adventure.Mary Dundas starts her story by wanting to move back with her family after an invitation from her brother. But her brother has other plans and sends her to be a tool in trying to protect a fugitive from England that is a sympathizer to the Jacobite cause. Mary tries to play her role perfectly but things quickly go south and she finds herself traversing the country with a quiet and intimidating Scotsman, a charming Englishman, and a chaperon. Their journey is perilous and forces Mary to abandon her ideals of living a peaceful life with her brother's family and stand up for herself.The romances are absolutely lovely in this book. Sara always pushes away her love interests and is content with being solitary for the rest of her life. She has accepted it and it's okay. Then she meets Luc Sabran who sneaks through the cracks in the walls she has built. He is patient and kind which is exactly what she needs in her life. Sara wants calm and steady and that is what he offers.And Hugh MacPherson...I have to say that he is my favorite hero that Kearsley has written so far. Yes, he bumped Rob off the top. He is so wonderfully written, it is amazing. Hugh is cold, removed, strong, stubborn, and all of the things you want/don't want in a damaged man. He just wants to keep everybody safe and do his job but the close quarters between Hugh and Mary force them to try to get along and help each other. Mary is originally terrified of him but it grows to respect and admiration in such a natural way that it is perfectly believable.The historical aspects of this book are on point, as per usual. This author loves this particular period in French and Scottish history and has done a great job of tying in the history with the romance. The outfits are period appropriate, the manner of speaking, and she obviously does her research. I love well planned books. They make my heart soar.Characters from the author's other novels make cameos which is fun in many ways. I like seeing that all the stories are tied together in some way. However, it can get a bit tiring. You have to remember their stories and make those connections and sometimes it can be annoying.There are 3 reasons that this isn't a 5 star book for me.1) The cover - not relevant to anything. Just a sepia tone of a pretty girl.2) The ending for Sara was too abrupt and I hated how it concluded way before Mary's story.3) The beginning was a bit slow. It was like the story had to gear up a bit before it got going. But if you're patient, it's entirely worth it.So yeah...another wonderful book from this author. It's such a fine and lovely thing that I couldn't even find gifs for it. I'm still basking in book afterglow here.Review also posted at Tara Belle Talking"}, {"userName": "Molly O'keefe", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4272235-molly-o-keefe", "userReview": "Am I super lucky to have gotten my hands on an early copy of A Desperate Fortune?

Thanks to my GRs friend Linda for her review which helped me to discover this gifted author.The story is actually two stories in one set in different times but connected through a diary of a young woman, Mary Dundas. The diary was written in 1732 during turbulent times of Jacobitism. It survived centuries but Mary\u2019s story was not known as the diary was written in a cryptic code. That is where the second story comes in. Set in present times, it features a programmer and amateur decoder, Sara Thomas, who breaks the code to give a voice to some thought ordinary but turned not so ordinary woman of the past. In a hand of a less gifted author, the book could\u2019ve been a total confusion and hard to follow as it goes from one narrative to another, featuring adventure, danger, spies, murder, and two love stories and, add to this, one story is written from the first person POV and the other is not. But it is not the case with this book. If I have one word to describe it, it would be \u201criveting\u201d. I had no problem following two storylines. It was very interesting to see how growth and maturity of Mary throughout her story helps Sara, who has the autism spectrum disorder, gain confidence in herself. Sara, slowly breaking the code, has discovered so much more about herself, including how to trust and more importantly how to love. Mary\u2019s story was my favorite of the two. It was so satisfying to see her growth from sheltered young maiden to a strong young lady. The two romances in the story were beautifully written. The chemistry between both sets of characters was palpable and the author achieved all of it without characters removing any piece of clothing :) The book has one of the most romantic declarations of love I read. It made me swoon! I feel like the book will stay with me for a long time."}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4519035-stephanie", "userReview": "What a fantastic premise! I\u2019m intrigue with stories that involve code breaking and to blend in a time slip theme gives a story more depth and compelling insight of the people in the story who break codes. Their process in doing so-if you will. The way their mind works is truly extraordinary and the author shows that in this story. Sara Thomas a women who was hired by an historian once famous is asked to cipher a journal from a women who lived in the past\u2026300 hundred years ago in fact. She is encouraged by her cousin to take the job. There is one thing, Sara has Asperger but this perhaps heightens her intelligence for ciphering codes. She decides to take the job and travels to Paris where the job is at. The journal is in a home of a women who is a photographer-a bit eccentric- but does not play a major role in the story. There she starts to decipher the journal and the tale takes a different direction than expected\u2026I enjoyed how the author weaved the modern day story with the historical one and I found myself wanting not to put the book down because I had to find out what came next. There is also a bit of romance that develops in the story I did not mention above and I felt it was nicely done. This is the second book I have read by this author and I feel this story is a vast improvement from the first one I read. I really enjoyed the writing style in this one. However, I felt there could have been stronger character development. I am rating this book four stars.*ARC received from NetGalley/publisher for an honest reviewStephanie M.

I was rewarded for sticking with the book around the 37th chapter (out of 42 chapters!) as at this point the pace picked up and it was a bit of Kearsley magic, but alas, too little, too late to give more than 2 or 3 stars."}, {"userName": "Angie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50378-angie", "userReview": "Originally reviewed here @ AngievilleI discovered  Susanna Kearsley's books a few years ago through the utterly wonderful  The Winter Sea. It was love from start to finish with that book, and I eagerly checked out a few more of her backlist. I never fell quite as hard with the others as I did with The Winter Sea though, and so when I heard about A Desperate Fortune it didn't automatically zip to the top of my TBR. But then my friend Beth read and loved it and did that thing where she smiles enigmatically and says, \"You'll have to tell me when you've read it.\" Implying that I will. And that it will likely go well. I trust her implicitly. But I am a bit of an uncooperative reading soul these days, and so I knew I would come to it when I came to it. Attempting to force things lately tends to backfire spectacularly. Then the other night I crawled into bed and cast about. As one does. I figured I'd give it a shot. Just the first few pages. Just to see . . .Sara Thomas has learned how to manage her life. She prefers to work alone when at all possible. She plays Sudoku when she gets anxious. She occasionally meets someone she's interested in seeing more. It lasts a few weeks, and then she ends it before she has to explain why it won't work long-term. She has her beloved cousin Jacqui to point her in the right direction in social situations, or provide her with the necessary reprieve as needed. So when Jacqui comes to her with an intriguing proposition related to one of her famous historians, Sara is interested. Having always loved code-breaking, she takes on the challenge of deciphering the fragment, only to find out the next step is a trip to France and the overwhelming task of deciphering the entirety of a young woman's journal. A young woman from the 18th century. Mary Dundas was born a Scot but raised in France. Her unusual tale takes her from the French countryside to the heart of Paris to the shadow Jacobite court in Rome. And Sara is along for the ride as she moves temporarily into the home of the woman who currently owns the journal and learns to navigate life in a small French village and the kind advances of an unusual family that lives there.I'm such a sucker for a Jacobite Rebellion tale. This likely dates all the way back to Patricia Calvert's wonderful  Hadder MacColl, which I read and loved as a kid. It was encouraged on by  Jennifer Roberson's  Lady of the Glen, which I read and loved as a teen. Ms. Kearsley excels at the time period as well, and her books have been such a delight to discover and love as an adult. As is often the case with a Kearsley book, I fell in love with the characters in the contemporary storyline first. I was fond of Sara instantly, as she matter-of-factly outlined her life with Asperger's, her reliance on her cousin Jacqui's social cues and advice, and her foray into amateur code-breaking as a form of independence in France. It took me a bit longer to warm up to Mary Dundas and her perilous journey. I am known to struggle with a road trip, but as soon as Mary made her way to Paris and took up the reins of her ruse, I fell into her story as well. The introduction of one mysterious Highlander by the name of MacPherson did not hurt in the slightest. As lasting imagery from this novel goes, it is those atmospheric scenes from Mary's life that linger in my mind. The unsettling glow of MacPherson's pipe lighting in a dark room. The tucking of a small dog into a rough cloak as tired feet press on. Two figures standing quietly just inches apart near the bridges of Rome.But my favorite scene of all (which I can't resist quoting a bit of for you here) comes from Sara's story. Sara's and Luc's.\"Luc.\" I felt a sudden weight within my chest, a pressing sadness as I realized he was wanting something more than I could give him; something more than just a simple holiday romance. \"I don't . . . I can't . . .\" He mattered more than any of the others had, and so it hurt me more to disappoint him, but that only made it more important he should hear the truth. \"I can't sustain a real relationship. I always mess things up.\" I'd meant to state that calmly as a fact, but my voice wobbled on the final words and Luc's own voice grew gentle in response.\"How do you mess things up?\"In every way conceivable, I could have told him. \"I just do.\"\"It might not happen this time.\"\"Yes, it will. It always does. I'm just not capable\u2014\"\"Who told you that?\" His words, still quiet, cut across my own with an insistence that I simply couldn't bring myself to answer, so I briefly closed my eyes and closed my mind against the memories.Luc fell silent too, and when my eyes came open he was watching me. Not crowding me, but standing close enough that I was very much aware of him.He asked me, \"If you could . . . if you were capable of having a relationship, would you want one with me?\"\"Yes.\"\"You like me.\"\"Yes.\"\"Good. So your plan was that we should spend time with each other, and then you would leave me?\"\"Yes.\"Luc gave a nod, and remarkably I saw the curve of his smile. \"What?\" I asked.\"It's a terrible plan.\" He came closer. \"No, really, you need to revise it. I'll help you.\"Two lovely, very subtle romances thread their way through the dual timelines. I found myself immeasurably charmed by both of them. The pacing on the whole is quite slow, languorously so. But my interest and attention never flagged. It merely meant my consumption of the novel was a more leisurely and relaxed affair\u2014an experience I thoroughly treasure. Susanna Kearsley's books always feel like the warmth of a fire on a winter night to me. If you find yourself with a few hours to spend on a cozy evening in the near future, I can't think of a more enjoyable read to tuck in with than A Desperate Fortune. I'll be gifting it this holiday season for sure."}, {"userName": "Amy S", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1010492-amy-s", "userReview": "This is a book about patience and broken people. I finished this book two days ago, but I've been kind of digesting my thoughts and sitting on this review. A departure from her last few books, this book does not contain any supernatural elements or time slips. It does follow a present day and past timeline. Sara, who has Asperger's, which in many ways makes her the perfect candidate to decode a diary from the 1700's written in cipher, And Mary, our Jacobite heroine who finds herself thrown into an adventure and possibly love.Both women are dealing with feelings of abandonment and rejection. Both are trying to find where they fit into the world and how to be authentically themselves (hello, Oprah!). I will get the cons out of the way first. I've got two biggies: The first half of the book is slow. Really slow. It gets better, but it is a slow book in general. Because she is a wonderful author it was not painful or boring exactly, but I honestly feel she could have edited more. It really did not get going for me at all until Chapter 17. Secondly, this is the first time in a Kearsley novel where I didn't feel the same love for both storylines. I was far less interested in the present-day timeline than with the historical one. It was a bit jarring for me to switch back and forth. I could have lingered in Mary's world happily without visiting Sara's much. On the one hand, having a heroine with a form of autism is pretty darn cool. It was interesting to navigate her world and thoughts. Sometimes, however, it could be a bit distracting for me. Pros? Yes. Mr. MacPherson has got to be one of my favorite characters in her novels. And I was so impatient with him at the beginning. What kind of hero could he possibly be, I kept thinking. I wasn't sure I was buying it. But by the end\u2026oh the end. For me, I felt like the last few scenes with them were just beautiful. And the relationship Kearsley built for them was real love. Not insta-love/lust, not convenient love-to-make-the-readers-happy. Real love. She didn't wrap up every storyline with a neat bow. Life is what it is. For me, the ending made the beginning worth it. Remember I mentioned patience? Patience is rewarded for Mary and for the readers. She really hits her stride on the last third of the book. This is where I felt her particular strengths as an author shone. Great characters, fantastic dialogue. I don't know if this will be one of my top favorites of hers, but there are definitely favorite scenes, definitely favorite characters (love the pirate captain!). And I would definitely re-read down the road. One way I know I love her books is when I finish the book and find myself re-reading huge sections just to absorb it better and to understand things I missed. *****************************************************ITS SUPPOSED TO ARRIVE AT MY HOUSE WEDNESDAY.

The past storyline never made an emotional connection with me, and the *twist* I've come to expect of Kearsley was missing in this one.What I did appreciate was that this Kearsley heroine (the modern day one) had Asberger's syndrome. I'm one of those readers who gnash my teeth over book heroines who have nothing to recommend them but pure physical beauty. It was a bold step for Kearsley to feature a person with strengths and flaws like the rest of us. I liked Sara and her struggles to find love and acceptance.Not my favorite, but still a good reading experience - can't wait for Kearsley's next one!

I spotted this one which promised a split story with two heroines a few centuries apart with a diary at the center of matters for them and settled in for an engaging set of stories.This is a standalone story, but fans of the Author's earlier Jacobite-centered stories like The Winter Sea and The Firebird will recognize a few crossover characters doing cameo scenes.The book opens with contemporary heroine, Sara Thomas, being offered the task of deciphering a 300 year old diary for an author's research project. Sara joins the household of the diary's current owner and slowly settles in to the French household and beginning her own little romantic adventure. While reading about the intrepid Mary Dundas, the girl's story captivates Sara and challenges her for the first time to take a chance and reach for what she really wants even if the negative voice in her head tells her she can never have a normal life.Born in exile to a Jacobite sympathizer and his French wife, Mary Dundas is sent to live with her aunt's family when she was just a little girl until the time comes that her brother comes for her. Mary discovers that all is not what it seems and she is now caught up in intrigue, espionage and danger. The people around her are keeping secrets and these are the people she must trust for her welfare. She wished to travel and for adventure. Now if she can only survive to appreciate it.Split stories between contemporary and historical times are an iffy venture for me. I usually end up preferring one story line over the other. And I did in this case, as well. Mary Dundas' story from the past held me attention much more over Sara's. However, that is not to say that I disliked Sara's story. Mary lives in dangerous, changing times with the English spying and keeping track of the Jacobites in exile and the Jacobites are constantly scheming to put their king back on the throne and gain Scottish. She is an ordinary young lady who only dreams of life outside her uncle's quiet home until she finds herself in the midst of a desperate adventure and a man she isn't sure she trusts holds her life in his hands.Sara has Asperger's syndrome and it controls her life to a certain extent. I loved seeing her work with it and figure out how to put things in place to work with it. She has kept quietly to herself preferring isolated jobs and assumes she can never have a long-term relationship until a handsome and lively Frenchman teaches her differently.While I didn't mind Sara's story, I did find the repetition that occurred a bit between Mary's narration and then Sara reading it again in the diary slowed things up somewhat and was a distraction more than anything. I also liked the romance she had, but it was fast and underdeveloped because the focus was more on Mary and the diary.Now Mary's story was the gem. I never wanted to leave off and go back to the present. She's surrounded by secretive and desperate characters. The reluctant adventure she is on hones her and shows her to be much more than she knew. She is surrounded by people who have seen tough and hard times and her opinion alters as she grows to understand how the world works.So in the end, this was a solid two for one story with well-drawn characters and a particularly compelling historical story full of suspense and a surprising romance.My thanks to Sourcebooks Landmark for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3919132-linda", "userReview": "With the kiss of dual timelines, Susanna Kearsley introduced a modern-day woman with Asberger's syndrome to 1730's France. Sara Thomas had been hired to help an author complete the last book in a trilogy. The country gentleman, Alistair Scott, took his research seriously. Determined to make his third story a success, he won Sara over by encouraging her interest. She was to unravel a code used in a diary by a young lady from a bygone era: Mary Dundas. With political intrigue humming in the background, Sara soon discovered Mary to be a human chess piece. I loved the two men who integrated themselves into the ladies' lives. The very modern and gentle Luc; written with such intelligence, assurance and devotion. And Hugh MacPherson: a Scottish Highlander, soldier and bodyguard. A loner even among compatriots. A deep thinker and a man that was so well-suited for Mary even when she wasn't aware of it. There was some wonderful chemistry with both couples but if you are expecting more, be aware that this was a clean romance.As I mentioned before, the story smoothly connected distinct and separate timelines. I never once had a problem switching from the present to 1732 and then back again. The author revealed the past using the third person and the present time using first person tense. It could have been tricky but Ms. Kearsley pulled it off. Be sure and pay close attention to the little nuances that the author slipped into some paragraphs. A seemingly innocent relationship. A certain individual's name. A casual thought. If you read something and your intuition tells you different, more than likely you are right. I was invested in Mary's mission and Sara's assignment; A DESPERATE FORTUNE succeeded because it captivated my emotions."}, {"userName": "Dorine", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6942470-dorine", "userReview": "Rated 4.5 - This novel is like an archaeological dig of words, with the main character in this century unraveling the clues about the main character in the past. Exciting and intriguing, A DESPERATE FORTUNE surprises with unexpected emotion.A great mixture of a modern day story following a mystery as it unfolds in history, A DESPERATE FORTUNE combines two time periods in a fictional tale that\u2019s exciting as well as emotional. I was drawn to this novel, not just for the historical aspects but also because the modern-day heroine\u2019s Asperger\u2019s diagnosis made me very curious about her coping mechanisms.Sara Thomas depends on her cousin Jacqui to calm her sometimes nonsensical Asperger\u2019s world. Sara knows she\u2019s different but Jacqui does her best to help Sara blend into society, even if Sara pretends to be what she\u2019s not in order to get through the more difficult moments. Jacqui teaches Sara to mimic normal so even those closest to her sometimes forget that she isn\u2019t just like them.When Jacqui presents Sara with a cipher to unscramble as a means to test her for a job with a client of hers, it challenges Sara. In the process, this cipher job resolves many of Sara\u2019s lifelong doubts about her ability to have a normal life, including meeting a man who accepts her uniqueness. The cipher leads Sara to France to decode a diary written by a woman in the 1700s. A DESPERATE FORTUNE is a historical adventure that unravels as a modern day mystery, enhanced by two love stories, one in present day and another in 1732.I\u2019m fond of journals and diaries, especially historical ones. I\u2019ve had this particular book on my wish list for some time and to my surprise the publisher granted my wish by offering it to me for review. I was in a reading funk at the time it was offered and since I was in desperate need of a good historical, I accepted. It was exactly what I had been seeking and in some ways beyond what I had imagined. I love it when I\u2019m surprised by a book.Mary Dundas had been left with relatives to raise her when her mother died and her father followed his political aspirations. She felt abandoned, so when her brother comes for her in 1732, something she had always dreamed about, Mary is too excited to ask very many questions. Eventually she realizes that she is the perfect solution to a Jacobite\u2019s need for discretion. Mary Dundas finds herself on a dangerous mission for a cause she has never supported until now, and falling for a man who is the most dangerous of them all. Will she live through the risky role she must play to find her happy-ever-after?I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. Lately I\u2019ve been avoiding books with this many pages because it takes me too long to finish the book, but I sped through this one. There were a few times when the extra-long sentences made me wonder when to breathe as I was reading, but I got used to them. There was also a section about halfway through the book where the character Mary was hashing out her situation within her mind and it seemed to go on a bit too long for me. But when you consider that this is an over 500 page novel and those are the only quibbles I had, which didn\u2019t stop me from reading further, then I\u2019d say this novel was near perfection.This book pulled me out of my reading funk because I couldn\u2019t put it down and when I did, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it. Any author who encourages my anticipation of the next page is bound to go on my favorites list.I especially enjoyed Sara\u2019s part in the story because she made Mary\u2019s story come alive. Sara\u2019s struggle with Asperger\u2019s was realistic and heartwarming. Mary is an innocent caught up in a time when her family is torn apart by their political beliefs and she is left to figure out where she fits in their lives. When Mary is given hope, she instantly gravitates toward it because it\u2019s all she has wished for and that makes her story all the more heartrending. I was emotionally captivated until the end and pleased with how both heroines\u2019 lives turned out, even though this book make me cry.I especially enjoyed Mary\u2019s ability to spin a tale to entertain. Her fairy tales were a nice touch to her character, adding an element I had never considered, keeping me further intrigued. I think that\u2019s what made this book so stimulating. The two time periods combine over time as the diary is decoded, but there is also the lightness of the fairy tales Mary makes up amidst the danger. It\u2019s the combination of several riveting elements for both characters that kept me captivated.I also think that historical lovers will enjoy the author\u2019s note at the end explaining how she created this book and how it relates to others she has written. I love knowing how much of historical fiction is true and where the author veered off with her imagination. The historical research is fascinating and how it all weaves into the story makes the book even more enjoyable. Susanna Kearsley\u2019s obvious talent has me anticipating more of her books.A DESPERATE FORTUNE is the type of fiction I like to read, with a little modern and a little history, traveling back and forth between the two time periods as the mystery resolves. It\u2019s like an archaeological dig of words, with the main character in this century unraveling the clues about the main character in the past. Neither character has accomplished anything of rare importance yet in their lifetime, but together they\u2019ll reveal their special qualities as the story unfolds. Exciting and intriguing, A DESPERATE FORTUNE surprises with unexpected emotion.Review by Dorine, courtesy of Romance Junkies and The Zest Quest.

She writes these dual stories, in two separate time-lines, and makes both of them magical and you feel like you are there, and it's all in the same book! While I enjoyed Mary and Hugh's story more than Sara and Luc's, I was equally as touched by Sara and Luc and the way he handled her and made her realize she didn't have to change and he wouldn't be scared away. The reason I enjoyed Mary and Hugh's story more? The history. I am a sucker for history and Susanna Kearsley does amazing research and weaves her tale into truth and you can almost believe that might have happened.

That's what happened to me with \"A Desperate Fortune\". It was fantastic, and just so much better than many others I've read written in the same vein. At first, I was intrigued by the modern storyline because of my immediate connection with Sara. She has Asperger's, and it was interesting for me, as the mother of a teenage Aspie boy, to see how she was able to cope with her own difficulties as an adult. She often has trouble making connections with others, and I'd say that her only real friend is her cousin. This older female cousin is wonderful, instinctively able to tell when Sara is becoming overwhelmed in social situations and excellent at redirecting her with Sudoku puzzles. She is also the one who gets Sara her job as a codebreaker, which is a perfect fit for Sara: she can work all day at something that intrigues her and not worry about fitting into the corporate world, which has always been a disaster in the past. In contrast, the historical storyline was a bit slower to capture my interest, but by the time I'd read about a third of the book, I was hooked! I could not wait to see what happened with Mary and Hugh, and I honestly wasn't sure how it all would end. It's definitely a bit of a slow build, but with that comes the satisfaction of reading a book that is truly well-crafted. I enjoyed every moment!Will you like this book?With its two connected storylines in two different time periods, I think this book will appeal to those who liked \"Sarah's Key\" by Tatiana de Rosnay or fans of Sarah Jio. Although the time period of the historical storyline is similar to Diana Gabaldon's \"Outlander\" series, I feel it would be unfair to compare the two - the \"Outlander\" series, while one of my favourites, is a serious commitment with the length of the series and the length of each individual book. \"A Desperate Fortune\", in contrast, is a standalone novel that probably won't take you months to finish. And while there is a bit of romance and a tall, masculine Highlander in this book, there's no steamy bodice ripping, etc. In other words, the romance is quite clean.Will I read more by this author?I've long been a Susanna Kearsley fan - she's Canadian, don't you know? - and I've read most of her older titles, but for some reason or other, I haven't read any of her newest books. Let me tell you that I will be remedying that very soon!"}, {"userName": "Emmy", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4838520-emmy", "userReview": "It took me a little while to get into this, but once I did I really enjoyed it. I can always count on Kearsley to deliver a well rounded, engaging, interesting story. Kearlsey almost always writes a dual timeline story, one set in present say and one in the past. In Mariana I really enjoyed the contemporary storyline and was disappointed there wasn't more of that. In this one, I had the opposite reaction. I didn't care as much for the present day storyline (I feel like it had something to do with Sara's Asperger's, which normally I would find interesting, but for some reason didn't connect as much with) as I did with the historical one. Mary's adventures really made Sara's storyline pale in comparison. I loved Mary and connected so much more with her feelings of loneliness and abandonment and enjoyed her romantic storyline so much more even though McPherson almost never spoke! Ha.I feel like Kearsley's storylines always need to be appreciated as a whole rather than it's separate parts because things don't always come together until the story concludes. While this one didn't have that classic Kearsley story twist at the end, it took me until the end to appreciate all of Mary's stories that she would tell along her journey. At the time, I would often feel like her tales would sidetrack the pace of the story, but of course it ends up all tying together so neatly in the end."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1023683-erin", "userReview": "I love everything Susanna Kearsley writes so I was always going to love this, but even so this has to be one of my favorites from her works (not the favorite though. The Winter Sea will always win for that, perhaps because it was my first foray with Kearsley).A Desperate Fortune features a lot of familiar elements for fans of Kearsley's other titles: romance, intrigue, dual narratives, and the modern day juxtaposed with the historical. Kearsley always does the dual narrative really well, but I have to comment on it here because I think she does it exceptionally in this story. There are no fantastical elements, no time travel or ghosts, so the reader is not required to suspend disbelief in any way (that's not a problem for me, but I know it can be for some readers). In modern times we have the heroine Sara, who has been brought to France to work on translating an encrypted diary from the 1700s. Through her translations, we get to follow the story of Mary, the original owner of the diary who wrote it in the 1730s.I'm particularly interested in the Jacobite uprisings and their repercussions, and the historical portions of this novel were well-researched and really made that time come alive for me. The heroine of the modern day portion has Aspergers, and I thought Kearsley did an excellent job at portraying her condition but not making Sara BE her condition. I appreciated both love storylines and managed to fall in love with two romantic leads at once, which might be a first for me. Even though this novel comes in at 528 pages, I ripped through it like it was half that. I wish I could erase it from my mind and read it all over again, I enjoyed it that much! Luckily, my memory will handle that for me in 1-2 years anyway :)**I received a free copy of this book for review via NetGalley.

Codes calm her and when an opportunity arrives to decode an old journal, it sounds like just the right task. As the journal begins to reveal its secrets, Sara finds so much more than a list of daily experiences, the life of Mary Dundas is a tale of a journey. Mary becomes embroiled with exiled Jacobites and danger is only one piece of what she finds once she makes the choice to live a more adventurous life. I have read a LOT of Susanna Kearsley and I have enjoyed them all, but I think this might actually be my favorite (a toss up between this and A Winter Sea). Both plots were so fleshed out and real. I liked living in both of these worlds - France in the present and France 300 years ago. One thing I particularly liked was that Sara, our protagonist, has Asperger's Syndrome. Any book that can gently and respectfully have a person with a disability in the narrative without making the disability be the point of the narrative gets three cheers from me. Sara is open and honest with us in her inner monologue about what she struggles with and how she copes with those things. She learns that having this disability doesn't make her un-lovable and wow, that's a great thing to learn.I liked the thread of Scottish lore and culture that's woven throughout Mary's story. The Jacobite period is clearly a favorite of Kearsley and Mary's interaction with the cause is a different twist than in previous books.Kearsley is just good at what she does - strong historical presence and sense of place. Her end notes show how deeply she researches the time period. This one is different in that there is no paranormal activity to help us as readers go back and forth in time - the journal plot device worked really well for me. Lovely romantic threads in both time periods, which I also found very fun.

There was no time travel, instead we just went back and forth between two women from two time periods. What connected them was a journal written in code.The story takes place in France, with Sara in modern time, and Mary in the 18th century.
