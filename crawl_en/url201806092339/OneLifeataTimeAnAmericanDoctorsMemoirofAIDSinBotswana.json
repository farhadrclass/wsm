As a kid born in the late 70\u2019s I remember the dark days of the 80\u2019s when people were dying in numbers from the disease and we assumed it would become a Black Death type plague, the early 90\u2019s when our beloved Freddie Mercury died, his illness a secret until his death. And then the ARV medication cocktails started to work, and people stopped dying... The billboards disappeared and we started to worry more about HPV-related cancers, Ebola, Zika, and the re-emergence of certain vaccine-preventable viruses like measles.Remember when reports told us that AIDS would wipe out Africa? Was it all scaremongering, or was it really on the brink of a continent wide pandemic? I certainly never really took too much time to do more than some topical research on the subject, just assumed that we had managed to solve the crisis with the drugs that had become the norm in the US. As I have been digging a little deeper into the subject recently, One Life At A Time by Daniel Baxter popped on my radar, and I feel it provides a very enlightening narrative into a small part of Africa and the AIDS epidemic, through Baxter\u2019s personal experience in Botswana.Baxter worked as an AIDS doctor in NYC during the worst US era of the illness, the 80\u2019s, and left for Botswana on a slight whim in 2002, excited to bring his expertise and care to the Batswana, where at the time a big portion of the population was assumed to be infected with the virus (24%). Through his two stays in Botswana (6 years and then 2 years with a 4 year hiatus between) Baxter recounts how he arrived in Botswana assuming certain things and instead learnt many lessons, some heartbreaking, some embarrassing, and some just really important along the way.Africa is a continent, a huge continent, comprised of many countries, and this memoir only describes the AIDS situation in Botswana from the early 2000\u2019s onwards, so while other countries similar in population and government might have had the same processes in place I think it\u2019s important to have a distinct view of all, just as we would when talking about different European countries. More importantly we should draw a comparison with other countries where the attitudes towards prevention and care have been different, or were different at the time (South Africa for example), to see how important the collaboration between the Botswana government, population and outside agencies was/is.There are times during his first stay in Botswana (6 years) when I felt that the narrative gets a little jumbled up, Baxter\u2019s memories and facts all colliding together, and I found it hard to fasten myself to a timeline or even a character or edifice that I would reencounter again down the road. This isn\u2019t a bad thing, just that sometimes the stories were combined in a way that makes it a little hard to get through, because you have to go back a few lines or pages and read them over again. The second part of the book, when Baxter goes back to Botswana for another stint after 4 years in NYC, is less haphazard, written with more focus, and a lot easier to follow in general.All in all I thought One Life At A Time was a great story of how an American doctor lands in a country he does not know at all, and learns so much more than he ever imagined he would. While Baxter brings his expertise to help the people of Botswana combat the epidemic of AIDS in the country, he receives so much more in return, including a lot of humility and a much wider view of the world. I feel like I learned so much more about Botswana than I ever knew before, and am now interested in learning much, much more. Last of all, I think it\u2019s very important to mention that Baxter never portrays himself as a savior - he just continued to do the work he had been doing in the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s in NYC in Botswana, and is very vocal about how much he learned about himself when he was there. One Life At A Time is a brilliant insight into the AIDS epidemic in general, how hard work and collaboration (we can include Dubya -in this part too - PEPFAR helped make a huge difference in how HIV positive patients in Africa received care), can turn despair into hope. I\u2019m looking forward to reading Baxter\u2019s other books now too.One Life At A Time will be published on June 12, 2018 by Skyhorse Publishing. Thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for the advance copy!"}], "description": "When Dr. Daniel Baxter arrived in Botswana in 2002, he was confident of the purity of his mission to help people with AIDS, armed with what he thought were immutable truths about life--and himself--that had been forged on his AIDS ward in New York City ten years earlier. But Baxter's good intentions were quickly overwhelmed by the reality of AIDS in Africa, his misguided altruism engulfed by the sea of need around him. Lifted up by Botswana's remarkable and forgiving people, Baxter soldiered on, his memorable encounters with those living with AIDS, and their unfathomable woes assuaged by their oft-repeated \"But God is good,\" profoundly changing the way he thought about his role as a doctor. Now, after caring for innumerable AIDS patients for eight years in Botswana, Baxter has written an urgent, quietly philosophical account of his journey into the early twenty-first century's new heart of darkness: AIDS in Africa, where legions desperately struggled to be among the spared and not the doomed. Part memoir, part travelogue, part chronicle of the zaniness of Botswana (one of the questions on his driver's license application was \"Are you or have you ever been an imbecile?\"), and part witness to suffering unknown to most Americans, his testimony is an unforgettable tribute to the many people he cared for.Join Baxter on his life-changing journey in Botswana, as he recounts the stories of people like Ralph, a deteriorating AIDS and cancer patient who nonetheless always wore a smile, or Precious, a woman found sick and abandoned in the capital's slum, or \"No Fear,\" a rude man in Baxter's gym whose descent he halted. After many years on the front lines of the African pandemic, Baxter realized that \"one life at a time\" was the only way to fight AIDS.", "title": "One Life at a Time: An American Doctor's Memoir of AIDS in Botswana", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36749560-one-life-at-a-time", "average": 3.0, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1522409152l/36749560.jpg", "reviews": 1, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3097960.Daniel_Baxter", "name": "Daniel Baxter"}], "type": ["Autobiography", "Nonfiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36749560-one-life-at-a-time", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21288120-coming-out-the-closet---how-to-tell-the-world-you-re-gay", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5501175-mama-s-kiss", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/732935.On_a_Street_Called_Easy_in_a_Cottage_Called_Joye", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27593962-the-year-jojo-s-daddy-saved-easter"]}
