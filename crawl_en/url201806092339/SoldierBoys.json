Today I was planning on reading only a chapter, but I ended up finishing it instead. The ending was so amazing and shocking that it actually made me cry! It makes one wonder if there are more books similar to this, either fiction or nonfiction. Stories like this showcase our history, and people should read about it.

It was about two young boys in World War II, German Dieter Hendrick and American Spence Morgan. They both join their armies because they want the chance to prove themselves on the battlefield.

I liked how it was about two soldiers and their time in war. I also liked how they were on different sides of the war so it talked in different perspectives. Another thing I like was how they were both fighting each other or they were against each other, but still helped each other out. I liked this book because it shows bravery, kindness, sadness, happiness, and so much more. I thing if you like war you would like this book.

Overall the book is confusing if you are like me you didn't understand that the 2 main characters were on the opposite side. It was really daunting to read because of the german word that are in it.

It is definitely one of the saddest books I have ever read. I like how the author wrote the book so you would know that Spencer and Dieter would eventually meet but you didn't know how they would meet. I like how she had them meet but did not tell you so you had to make an inference that the German soldier Spencer was helping was Dieter. I did not expect them to meet like that and I definitely did not expect Spencer to sacrifice himself for Dieter. Like other reviewers on goodreads said it was the most heartbreaking part of any book I have ever read. This book shows the story of two young men on different sides of WWII. This book was written so well and had so much suspense that I wanted to keep reading and could not put it down. It was hard to read after Spencer was killed and it was even sadder when you read about Dieter's side of the story. He knew Spencer was trying to help him but he could not say anything. Overall I loved this book but it was so sad."}, {"userName": "Susannah", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/981163-susannah", "userReview": "This book had a really profound effect on me. Spencer demonstrated what it means to be a true Christian. The fact that a 16 year old boy is willing to show such humanity towards his \"enemy\" is very touching. I cried when I read the last page. Spencer started out as an innocent young boy who wanted to become an illustrious and famous soldier to impress a girl. He died as a much more remarkable hero - the type that doesn't win every honor that the army has to offer, the type that doesn't get remembered in history books. He died showing humanity to his fellow man. That is what true bravery is. All in all, an excellent book."}, {"userName": "Riley Schopf", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59210341-riley-schopf", "userReview": "This is my favorite book this whole year! The whole book was centered around to teenagers that join the army during World War 2. Dieter is one of the boys, and he is a German. And Spence is the other boy and he is American. The conflict is the trails they face and how meet while fighting. What happens when they meet, it's so unpredictable. Dieter is injured, and crying for help, on the bottom of a hill. The Americans hear him, but because he's German, they order their men to leave Dieter to die. But Spence disobeys orders. He goes down the hill. Finds a dead medic and takes his supplies, and goes to the crying Dieter laying on the ground. And he saves his life. But more Germans show up. I don't want to spoil it , but know that it was so sad, and depressing, but so heartwarming, I almost cried. It's just amazing how the author can just use both characters so cohesively to tell the brilliant story."}, {"userName": "Joanna", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/726162-joanna", "userReview": "I don't think I've ever read a more heartbreaking story in my life.

It gives the reader a hope that the narrator will survive the horrible events that you know will unfold. Unfortunately this book is in third person. Actually, it's two third person stories interwoven. One, that of Dieter, a young German boy swept up into the Hitler Youth, and the other of Spencer, a young Mormon boy, who quits high school in order to enlist in the paratroopers. Both boys come to see behind the glamour of war to the dirty, awful, soul killing business that it really is. Novels like this are necessary. Particularly those that might be read by impressionable young men, giving them a glimpse into just what being a soldier might mean. Perhaps Spenser's christian act of heroism toward the end of the book will be seen, appreciated and possibly even emulated by those most in need of the example.This novel is a fast read and for the most part an easy one. And yet, it's worth the time. This book doesn't dwell on the misery as Erich Maria Remarque did in his WWI tome but the message still gets through. I would highly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Mrs.Morgan", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34425339-mrs-morgan", "userReview": "(The beginning of this book made me nervous as it started out quite slow. However, after about 40 or 50 pages, I started to notice my interest level changing and my desire to put the book down became less and less).This is such a great dual-perspective story about a boy named Spence and a boy named Dieter. As the story progresses, you come to care greatly for both of the characters, even when you want to shake some sense into Dieter.Dean Hughes did an incredible job weaving a tale that ultimately leaves you sad and heart-wrenched but with just the right amount of distress. It is not hard to imagine that tales like this happened over and over again in WWII and that gives this text a feeling of authenticity.I would absolutely recommend this book to both adults and young adults, and specifically those who don't typically like historical fiction.

In my opinion, it wasn\u2019t a good book in the first time I read me feel that I was staying in the war. By the way, this story talks about 2 young men came from 2 other countries which were an enemy in the World War II, they are America and Germany. Spence Morgan, who was an American boy wanted to prove himself to his family and his friends, Spence was 16 when he decided he wanted to go into military, he was excited, thinking he'd be a hero, especially since he was joining the paratroopers which were thought to be the bravest and the best. He couldn't until he was 17, and he still legally needed his parents to permit him to until he was 18, and surprisingly his dad lets him. About Dieter, he is a young German was affected by the war while he was a little kid. \u201cHitler Youth\u201d, the program that forced kids to become part of the war, they made the kids dig out trenches on the war front. Dieter aspired to go up the ranks of Hitler youth and eventually go into the military, which he did.  In the book, author interspersed story between two characters but at the end of the story, he connected two of them back in an ingenious way, I think he did it because he wants to attract readers, don\u2019t make them feel boring when they are reading it. Also while I was reading it, I could imagine that I was in the war, I could hear the sound of the guns and tanks were fighting together on the snow and a lot of people were killed. Throughout this book, Dean shows us the tragic of the war that a lot of people were killed just because they want to protect their country, their home, their family. The war also took away their dream, they have a lot of things need to do in the future it\u2019s gone because of the war. This story also shows us the personality of the people, the soldier in the war. They don\u2019t care there are an enemy or not, but they give together the compassionate just because in their soul, they don\u2019t want to kill people, they just want to protect their country but the war forced them to do it. The end of the story made me surprised because it is way different what I was thinking and I still have some disappointed but it is still a good book."}, {"userName": "Corey Butler", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71445943-corey-butler", "userReview": "I liked the book, I think part of it is that I am interested in WWII.

Would you like to hear it from two different sides? The novel Soldier Boys by Dean Hughes should be your next reading adventure. It fits into the genre of historical fiction, young adult fiction, and biographical fiction. It is a tragic and compassionate type of novel. The novel takes place in Germany, then in Utah during the time of World War I. The author did a great job explaining the difference between the military in Germany and the military in the United States of America. I enjoyed reading this book, it kept my attention the whole time.The two main characters of this book are Dieter Hedrick and Spencer Morgan. Dieter is a fifthteen year old boy who is part of the Hitler Youth, which is explained in the book, and Dieter is devoted to join the German Army when he is old enough to do so. Dieter wants to show his bravery to everyone and to show what he can do. Spencer is a sixteen year old boy who dropped out of high school in Utah, just so he can join the military to become a paratrooper. Spencer wants to prove to his family and friends that he is more than a high school dropout and that he will come home a hero. Both of the boys do not want the war to end, they want to be able to join and be part of it, so they can show people what the can do. Dieter wanted to be just like Hans Keller, the seventeen year old leader of the local troop. Dieter wanted to be as strong and have the bravery that Han has. Spencer wants to be like his older brother, Robert, who dropped out of Box Elder High School to join the military. Spencer wanted to show people what a high school dropout can do, just like what his brother did. Both Dieter and Spencer just want to be like their older piers.I give this book a four out of five stars. The author did a great job showing the difference and similarities between Spencer and Dieter. The language he used was easy to understand, I did not get lost in the book, I was able to understand everything the author was talking about. I enjoyed this novel very much, it kept my interest throughout the whole novel. I was very much enjoyed because it was about one of my favorite topics, the military. This is a fantastic book, I suggest it to older middle school kids and up. Due to the subject I would not advise kids younger than that to read this book due to fact that they might understand what is going on in the novel."}, {"userName": "Christina B.", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14033856-christina-b", "userReview": "After finishing \"Soldier Boys,\" by Dean Hughes, I was rather disappointed. This book did not really stand out to me, it just seemed like your average historical fiction novel about World War Two.At first, this book seemed like it was going to be very exciting. One of the main characters, Spencer, wanted to join the army and was trying to convince his dad to sign his papers. When Spencer's dad did sign the papers, he went to a military training camp in Georgia. At this point, Spencer's part of the story became boring. The book really did not give too many details, and the plot became redundant. Then, Spencer went off to war. The rest of Spencer's part of the story was basically him complaining about how he wanted to go home and see his family again, because so many men in his company were being killed.The other main character, Dieter, had his own separate story. I thought his part of the story was more interesting. Dieter was part of the Hitler Youth, which was an organization that taught boys the principles of Nazi ideology. When Dieter is old enough, he is sent off to war in the Battle of the Bulge. I liked this part of the book because I liked another character, Schaefer, who was Dieter's \"guardian\" of sorts. He told Dieter all about the atrocious things the Nazis were doing, and Dieter refused to believe him. This was interesting to me because in real life, the Germans didn't know what Hitler was actually doing--he told them lies (And they believed them, too!). The part of the book told from Dieter's point of view was definitely more interesting than Spencer's point of view.Overall, Soldier Boys was a good book. Although there were some parts that I didn't like, this book really made me think about what it was like to be fighting for the Axis, not the Allies. I would recommend it to anyone who likes reading about history or likes historical fiction novels. Also, I would recommend it to people over age eleven or twelve because there is violence and vivid descriptions of death."}, {"userName": "Anthony The", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16193118-anthony-the", "userReview": "Soldier Boys was a very good book and it was really interesting to see World War 2 from the view of a young American boy, and a young German boy. This book is about two young boys, one from America named Spence, and one from Germany named Dieter, that both wanted to do their part in the war to help their country. Everyone learns about World War 2 in school and from your parents, how horrible it was and how so many died, but they never tell you what it was like from the perspective of the people. Spence was 16 when he decided he wanted to go into he military, he was excited, thinking he'd be a hero, especially since he was joining the paratroopers which were thought to be the bravest and the best. He couldn't until he was 17, and he still legally needed his parents to permit him to until he was 18, and surprisingly his dad let him! What was even more surprising reading about it from Dieter's view. In our society everyone thinks all the Germans were evil and heartless at the time, but the kids were practically brain-washed into believing everything Hitler said, mostly through \"Hitler Youth\" which was a program that forced kids to become part of the war, they made the kids dig out trenches on the war front. Dieter aspired to go up the ranks of Hitler youth and eventually go into the military, which he did. Also Dieter's older experienced partner, Schaefer, didn't approve of Hitler of the War, which Dieter was angry about. Eventually they became friends, but Shaefer died, and it was very sad. Dieter also almost died but he was saved by Spence, the only American soldier that cared about the inured screaming german in pain, then he was shot and killed by germans while helping Dieter. This changed Dieters outlook on Americans, on the war, and on the Nazi's. It was very sad when Spence died, but it helped to change the life of Dieter.

I also like how the author of the book described the scenes and scenario so could I had a very clear pretty of what it must of been like for them and how it was. What I didn't like about the book was that the author did not make the story line till the very end of the war and only a few battles in the whole book happened.
