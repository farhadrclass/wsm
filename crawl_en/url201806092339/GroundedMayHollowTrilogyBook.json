Just the name of this hop made me think about a novel I could get cozy with on a cold winter night. For that reason I\u2019ve chosen Grounded by Angela Correll. When I read the publisher\u2019s description of Grounded, it resonated with me personally but I also thought it was universal and timely given what so many people have gone through in the recent economic upheaval in the U.S. Layoffs seem to have been the norm instead of the exception for the last 4-5 years. In fact a friend said on Facebook just the other day that layoff season was approaching at her company, a phenomenon of the times. This is a novel about finding what\u2019s important to you in life, getting back in touch with your values. It\u2019s about family, roots, and most of all about reinventing yourself \u2013 and that\u2019s something we all have to do at some point in our lives. Although I\u2019d classify it as contemporary Southern women\u2019s fiction, I think it will resonate with most people no matter where they live or where they come from. And someone is going to win a copy in our giveaway at http://popcornreads.com/?p=6772."}, {"userName": "Lesley", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3149156-lesley", "userReview": "If I had to pick one word to describe this book it would be \"nice\". It's just a \"nice\" book. It's an easy read that doesn't stir up too many emotions and doesn't have much action. If I had known it was Christian literature, I never would have picked it up in the first place. While the story was quite interesting, though a tad predictable, I wanted nothing to do with the religious \"teachings\" of it. I found some of the dialogue a bit forced and not quite organic feeling... but maybe that's because I'm not a Southerner? One thing I liked was the discussion of \"new\" farming practices and I feel like I could go can my own green beans now :)"}, {"userName": "Logan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13709892-logan", "userReview": "I found this novel extremely refreshing and perfect for Correll's debut novel. Being a southern girl myself, it was extremely relatable and familiar. At times I felt like I was reading about my family and hometown. I absolutely loved the characters, especially the grandmother. Her strong personality and stubbornness reminds me of my grandmother. She definitely made me laugh. I also really loved that she quoted scripture throughout the book. I loved that this book was extremely clean. It is a nice change compared to many other novels out there. I feel really good about recommending this book to family and friends, since I am often reluctant to do so with other novels because of the language. The story reminds you how special and valuable home is and reminds you of the importance of family and your heritage.The only negative I would give this book is that it was a little slow through the middle. It had a great beginning and end, but the middle did seem to drag for a bit. Other than that, it kept my attention and I was able to fly through it. It was a very enjoyable book.If you're looking for a feel-good read, this is the book for you! It will bring you home to the south and make you smile. I look forward to reading the sequel! I gave Grounded 5 stars.This book will be available October 1st!

Soon her noncommittal boyfriend\u2019s true nature is revealed, and to top it all off, she loses her apartment.With nowhere else to go, Annie leaves the city for the family farm in Kentucky, a place she\u2019s avoided for years. She finds a shotgun-wielding grandmother, a farm in disrepair, and a suspicious stranger renting the old stone house. The country quiet haunts Annie with reminders of a past that can\u2019t be changed. She tries persuading her grandmother to sell the farm, but is met with stubborn refusal. Yet in the midst of her crashing life, Annie sees a glimmer of hope for a second chance. Jake Wilder is contemplating jumping off the corporate ladder to follow his passion for sustainable farming. He\u2019s almost ready to propose to Camille, a girl who wants more, not less. Annie believes Jake is about to make a terrible mistake, but does she have the right to tell him? As the summer heats up, so do Annie\u2019s unexpected feelings for Jake and her interest in the land. When a sudden phone call comes from New York, Annie is forced to choose between coming to terms with her past or leaving it all behind. My Review:Thirty-two-year-old, Annie Taylor was a ten-year flight attendant with TransAir. Right now she is warned about losing her job as there are other airline companies attempting a takeover. Losing her job would make it difficult to pay her part of the rent on the apartment she shared with three other flight attendants. However, her handsome boyfriend, Stuart told her not to worry about it that he\u2019d look after her. Annie met Stuart six months ago at a costume party. Not only was he extremely good looking, but successful and rich. For her birthday just past, he gave her a pair of beautiful diamond earrings and asked her to move in with him. Soon enough, Annie finds out some very disturbing news about Stuart. She accidentally bumped into someone she didn\u2019t know and they struck up a conversation about Peoria, Illinois and Annie happened to mention her boyfriend had grown up there. Well, she received some very unexpected news, with details, about her lover, Stuart. Annie went directly to his office to in the financial district of New York, but Stuart wasn\u2019t there. (I\u2019ll leave it up to you readers to find out on your own what happened and where he was.) Feeling irritated and frustrated, Annie returned to work only to be confronted by her boss. He told Annie the takeover had taken pace and now she was out of a job, effective immediately. Annie rented a car and made the twelve hour drive to her Grandma Beulah\u2019s farm in Kentucky. Beulah was so happy to see her granddaughter after almost a year, except for a very short stop-over at Christmas. She planned on staying about a month, hoping by then that she could be re-hired at the new airline that took over TransAir. The following day, a Sunday, was Beulah\u2019s turn to host the after church dinner. With a beautiful beef supper and everyone happy to see Annie after all this time, they had a nice evening. Evelyn was there whose son, Jake had grown up with Annie after her mother died when she was twelve. It just so happened that Jake too was taking time off work to contemplate his future. Evelyn told Annie that she hoped she and Jake would have some time together for old time sake. Jake was currently dating Camille and had been since last fall, but Jake had known her father for years and he had been a mentor to Jake through banking connections. Camille was also coming down to the farm to spend time with Jake. With the string of recent home invasions occurring lately, Annie suggested Gramma consider selling the farm and moving into town to a nice apartment with far less work for her to do. At seventy-something she wasn\u2019t getting any younger but Beulah slept with a loaded shot gun underneath her mattress just in case these home invaders dared to get into Beulah\u2019s place looking for money to buy drugs which had become a big problem in the area recently. But Beulah had no intentions whatsoever of selling the farm and that was the end of the conversation. One morning, Annie decided to go for a jog around the farm area. On the way back she carefully took in the sites of the fences, the house, the old stone house out the back which had just been recently rented, the barn, and all the other out-buildings. Upon this close scrutiny she realized how much the farm had fallen into disrepair since her grandfather passed away a couple of years ago. At the same time, Annie did understand that it was a lot of upkeep for someone Beulah\u2019s age. Annie missed her grandfather and used to love spending time with him. He always listened to her without judgment and encouraged her dreams for the future. Her relationship with her grandmother was a bit strained as she always had to turn any conversation into a lesson for Annie to learn. Her grandfather said they were too much alike. Jake finally stopped by to visit with Annie. They reminisced about old times, talked about Jake\u2019s girlfriend, Camille, and Annie\u2019s break-up with Stuart. Annie asked Jake what his plans for the future were and he replied that was why he was here at the farm trying to decide and sort things out in his mind. He was leaning toward farming where his real passion lay. Jake realized farming now required a big operation in order to be successful and sustainable which is what he had to investigate while he was here. However, Camille\u2019s father wanted Jake to work with him in the hotel business as did Camille, but that wasn\u2019t really his thing. Farming was definitely at the top of his list. After Jake left, Annie thought about how Jake was like a brother to her, but the years that had passed had pushed them apart. But \u201cbeing with him again reminded her of their easy relationship, of how he made her laugh and his positive view of life.\u201d After walking through the old cemetery one afternoon and reading all the headstones of passed on family members, it really hit Annie at how much loss she and her grandmother both had suffered. Annie and her grandmother were all that was left of the family and she made a solemn vow to her grandmother that she would do everything possible in her power to hold onto the old farm after her grandmother was gone. Annie began to realize that the lack of visiting in the past had been a serious mistake and promised to visit more often. The importance of family and feeling connected was a glaring reality for Annie. She realized her poor visitation record had been hard and sad for her grandmother and she now regretted that. Jake\u2019s girlfriend, Camille finally arrived and before Annie even met her she sees them hugging and embracing each other which bothered her for some reason. After a few moments she pretends or tries to tell herself that she doesn\u2019t really care, but deep down she does. It didn\u2019t help matters any that from a distance, Camille looked to be about a size zero and with that blonde hair, it made Annie feel a tad jealous of her being with Jake but didn\u2019t understand why it bothered her so much? Was she beginning to have different feelings for Jake other than the brother/sister type relationship they\u2019d enjoyed their whole lives? The more Annie gets to know Camille, the more she realizes that Jake is making a terrible mistake in marrying her. Annie found her to be deceptive, manipulative, and obviously a tad spoiled. But, was it her place to talk to Jake and tell him what she thinks and feels? And, what is she going to do about her job back in New York, will she return when or if she is re-hired by the new company? I was totally captivated by Grounded. It was full of beautiful imagery that I could picture in my mind\u2019s eye, it had just the right amount of romance to make the novel perfect. I loved the fact of Annie and Grandmother living off their own land. I loved Annie and Beulah, although their relationship was a wee bit strained at times, there was no doubt whatsoever that they loved and respected each other deeply. Annie\u2019s time on the farm only enhanced and reinforced their bond. Their relationship made me think about my Grandmother and how much I loved her, we were very close but she\u2019s been gone now for thirteen years. Beautifully written, Grounded is a skillfully woven story that takes you through unexpected twists and turns. Immerse yourself in the heartwarming and surprising tale of love, forgiveness, the importance of family, and healing. I guarantee your heart and soul will be touched by this charmingly written novel!!!"}, {"userName": "Laura Larson", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50970801-laura-larson", "userReview": "Wonderful book for a beach read- something that came be gobbled up quickly, keeps your interest, doesn't speed your heart rate up much and only excites happy emotions. Nothing sexy, nothing to make even the most proper lady clutch her pearls. A bit more preachy than I expected, but I guess that's to be expected when the setting and characters are stereotypical \"down south\" country folk. If I have anything negative to say about this book, it's that. However, they don't come across as unrealistic (having lived both in the South and in a small farming community I know these stereotypes exist for a reason) or unlikable. Annie, the main character, is in her 30s. It's refreshing to see a female MC that isn't LOOKING for love. She's been loving on her own for years, but still seems as uncomfortable with her ability to actually take care of herself-financially and otherwise. She DOESN'T have life all figured out. I don't want to say \"refreshing\" again, but that really is the best word for everything about this book."}, {"userName": "Hope", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13246091-hope", "userReview": "I read the second book in the series first (Guarded) and I think the author was hitting her stride by the second installment. Parts of Grounded felt a little forced to me. I'm not against buying local, farm-to-table produce, or sustainable farming, etc., but Correll mentioned them one time too many for them seem like a natural part of the story. Also, although the characters talk about God much more naturally than in most Christian fiction, there were a few times when the subject seemed forced - like when Annie recommits her life to the Lord out of nowhere. Still, I like Correll's \"voice\" and the varied personalities of her characters. I was glad the romance wasn't front and center in this book. And that Annie matures as the book goes along. She wasn't just grounded from flying as a stewardess, but she learned to be grounded in the things that matter."}, {"userName": "Jessica *The Lovely Books*", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2621253-jessica-the-lovely-books", "userReview": "I think the most disappointing part of the whole book was the romance aspect of it.

Your flight has been \"grounded.\" To others the term means simply to find roots where you can stay, often times making it a permanent home. In the debut novel from author Angela Correll, both of these terms work when applied to Annie Taylor, a flight attendant who has been working for TransAir for well over ten years. By accepting whatever schedules are available, she has managed to travel to places in the world, most never get to but dream of often like Italy during her international flights. However like all companies in a worrisome economy, TransAir is no stranger to corporate takeovers and that is just what happens, leaving Annie with no job. Force to abandon her apartment when she was considering moving in with her boyfriend Stuart, she learns during a conversation with a passenger that Stuart isn't all he claims to be. Besides being afraid of commitment, she learns that her entire relationship with him has been built on lies that he has spoon fed her. Now she isn't about to waste anymore time with him and heads back home to her grandmother's home on the farm in Kentucky for some time to consider just what lies next for her. Beulah Campbell believes her greatest gift is hospitality and to prove that point she hosts a dinner party with close friends every Saturday night. Mostly it is her chance to share with others the bounty of her garden, pot roast, green beans, macaroni and cheese, homemade biscuits and of course pie during most of the meals. Her close friends always came and offered to bring a dish or stay and help cook. It was truly a wonderful time to sit around the table and share not only great food but friendship and conversation. She just never expected her granddaughter Annie to return to the farm after living in New York. But perhaps God has a greater plan in all of this and thus the reason for the timing. Beulah, now 70 is facing the need for knee surgery but has put it off because she has no one to care for her. Annie is the only family she has left. Annie's plans are to hope that her old boss will be able to find a position available for her soon with the new airlines so can resume her busy life once again. But there is something healing about not only coming back to her roots but the change of pace she finds here simply smelling the fresh air and listening to the sounds that only country living can provide. Yet will the call of a new life involve a close friend Jake Wilder that is just now returning home as well? Only this time he has brought his new girlfriend home as well. I received Grounded by Angela Correll compliments of McAllister PR and Koehler Books for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review and the opinions expressed are strictly my own. This is such an incredible story that anyone can relate to. It's about finding out where your home truly is. For some, they feel they must spread their wings and search for it somewhere else, but for others it simply means coming back to those who love and accept you for who you are and a different change of pace. This is such an outstanding book because of how well it's written, I could smell the fresh soil as Annie and her grandmother worked in the garden, feel the breeze on my skin as the birds from the field were calling their music. Just the picture alone calms the soul and creates a longing for a simpler life. I easily give this one a 5 out of 5 stars and can't wait for many more books from this author. She is definite on my must watch list and this novel joins my permanent collection of great books to enjoy over and over again."}, {"userName": "Tamara", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7757267-tamara", "userReview": "Review originally posted:Traveling With T Annie is a flight attendant- flying the skies to far-flung places around the world. When she is home, New York City- with it\u2019s wonderful ambience and never-ending options of things to do, places to eat, and buzzing activity. Annie is happy- jet-setting off to great places, coming home to her sweet boyfriend. The only teeny concern- there is talk of a merger- which could lead to losing her job. But, Annie is sure the airline will work out the necessary details and keep her flying the good life. Annie has a boyfriend who she adores- and he asks her to move in with him- which she takes a step on the way to the rest of their lives.One day, on a flight, Annie begins chatting with someone who sheds a light on her relationship- and Annie is concerned. When she gets home, she finds that she had reason to be concerned. So, she doesn\u2019t have a place to live, no boyfriend, and then she gets the final bad news- she\u2019s been grounded. Her boss hopes to get her back in the air in a few months- but the 2 airlines need time to see who they are keeping and who will not be re-hired. Annie decides to head to her family farm- back to Kentucky.When Annie arrives in Kentucky, life on the farm has changed. Her grandmother\u2019s getting older and can\u2019t keep up with farm life like she once was able. Annie suggests selling the farm and downsizing to a smaller home- but her grandmother balks at the idea. At first, Annie does not understand. Soon, though, farm life begins to feel right to Annie.

She\u2019s a regular flight attendant on the New York/Rome route and has given notice to her three flight attendant roommates on their apartment. She\u2019ll move in with her boyfriend after this flight.As fate would have it, the obnoxious woman in first class has information Annie needed to know about Stuart and she realizes she can\u2019t go through with her planned move. Then the rumors of a takeover of the airline she works for become reality. She finds herself without a job and without a home.What choice does she have but return to Kentucky to visit her grandmother? Except they\u2019d never been close. The link that had bound them together after Annie\u2019s mother\u2019s death was Annie\u2019s grandfather, who\u2019s now gone. Even a week or two butting heads with her opinionated grandmother may be too much, but Annie can see Beulah needs help. It becomes Annie\u2019s job to try to convince her grandmother to sell the farm and move into town, but the old woman won\u2019t budge.Jake, the boy-next-door and Annie\u2019s childhood playmate, keeps returning to Kentucky as he determines whether to stay in his successful banking career or grasp his dream of sustainable farming with gusto. His fiancee may have something to say about that, though.While Annie waits for the take-over dust to settle in New York and to be rehired by the new airline, she takes over the garden and canning under Beulah\u2019s tutelage. She finds her roots more tightly bound in Kentucky soil than she\u2019d imagined. Will she return to the city and the skies, or stay grounded?Grounded is a sweet story of homecoming and the value of simple living. It\u2019s also a perfect example of farm lit from a Christian worldview. Farm lit is all about the life of modern-day \u201cnew\u201d farmers. \u201cThese stories can be fiction or memoir, and most often include city-bred heroines who head for an idealized rural existence and (often) find the man of their dreams riding a tractor rather than a horse or a motorbike.\u201d Grounded provides that with a slight twist in that Annie is returning to her farm roots.Why is farm lit a growing genre? Today\u2019s world is full of uncertainty. We have this feeling we\u2019re careening along the brink of disaster and, strangely, we don\u2019t like it. Many people are filled with longing to be connected, to be \u201cgrounded\u201d as it were. To feel the soil between their fingers, to know where their food comes from, and to sink into a simpler lifestyle. If you can\u2019t do it in person\u2014though, in my opinion, you should try!\u2014you can do it through immersion in a story like this one.If you loved my debut novel Raspberries and Vinegar: A Farm Fresh Romance, you\u2019ll love Grounded."}, {"userName": "Stacie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/763153-stacie", "userReview": "Annie is a flight attendant who grew up on a tobacco farm in Kentucky, but now lives in New York City. Annie was raised by her grandparents after her single mother died much too soon. After Annie's grandfather died, she focused more on her work and less on her grandmother back on the farm because the memories hurt too much. Then Annie loses her job to a airline buyout and finds out her boyfriend isn't the man she thought he was. With no where else to go, Annie decides it is time to go back to Kentucky and face her memories. Once she is there, Annie isn't prepared for what she feels and what lies ahead. This is the author's first novel and she has based it on her own personal background of farming and promoting local food and resources. I found the story quite easy to follow and the characters appealing. Annie is a likable character and you genuinely feel sorry for her when events turn her life upside down. The story really kicks in gear once she returns back to her grandmother's farm and you learn all the history behind Annie's childhood. The characters that live around the farm are funny, lively, and well developed. You could almost imagine each one of them in your mind. Beulah, Annie's grandma, was by far my favorite. Throughout the story, Beulah imparts wisdom and truth by sharing her values and her faith. As a woman who grew up during the depression, her farming and gardening methods are very important to the story and give it the basis for Annie's future in the story. A lot of the sayings in the story like \"Hard work is hard on the body, but good for the soul\" reminded me of my own parents and grandparents.As a child who also grew up on a farm and yet doesn't currently live on one, this story reminded me of all the things I appreciate about going back home. The gardening, the canning, the horses, the sights and the sounds in this story all reminded me of home. The importance of farming takes center stage in this novel and will make you question where and how you get your food to feed your family.The author adds a mystery character to the story that gives it a twist and keeps you guessing along the way as to her identity and reason for her secrets. Even though her story is minor, it offers a nice balance and intrigue to the rest of drama.I think this is a great \"weekend read\" and a story that you could share with your grandmother! It will leave you feeling happy and nostalgic for family and home."}, {"userName": "Ashley", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/300048-ashley", "userReview": "I am happy to report that I was able to read an advance copy of Angela Correll\u2019s debut novel, Grounded.From the Amazon book summary: New York City flight attendant Annie Taylor is grounded.

Her arrival is met by a shotgun-wielding grandmother, a suspicious stranger moving into the old stone house, and her attractive childhood friend Jake about to make the biggest mistake of his life. Struggling against her grandmother\u2019s stubborn ways, Annie disagrees with her on the fate of the family farm but stays on to help her grandmother through a knee surgery by tending the garden and learning how to can the vegetables. Through the summer\u2019s trials, Annie is forced to face her own past mistakes and the consequences. When the phone call comes from New York earlier than expected, Annie must choose between coming to terms with her deep roots or leaving it all behind for a return to the city.Overall, I liked Grounded. Anyone who has lived in or spent time in small southern towns will certainly recognize the language, colloquialisms, and sense of community. That part felt very familiar to me as I was reading- almost as if some of my own relatives were speaking. As is the case in many southern towns, the church is a social center, so a tolerance for church relationships and mentions of Jesus are a must for readers to stay engaged and enjoy the book.Annie is a believable character who grows as a person through the course of the story- albeit in a somewhat predictable manner. That\u2019s not to say that it isn\u2019t enjoyable, just that I wasn\u2019t terribly surprised by certain turns of events as the book progressed.I liked the way the characters relate to each other. Sometimes you don\u2019t need high drama to tell an interesting story, and understated can be just as entertaining as a tale fraught with tension.I enjoyed Grounded and I\u2019m looking forward to reading more from Angela Correll.- See more at: http://thebookfetishblog.com/2013/11/..."}, {"userName": "Ally", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10598644-ally", "userReview": "I won a copy from Goodreads First Reads.Grounded is a pretty short book that takes about a few hours at most to read unless you're taking time off in between pages. Let me tell you something, so you will know this ahead of time. Grounded barely mentions anything about Annie's job as a flight attendant. Yes, she's grounded. No, she does not care a thing.It's told from majorly two POVs, the shotgun grandma (thank goodness it's not mine), and Annie (Oakley) Taylor (who is deathly afraid of shotguns). Truthfully, I dislike the grandmother whenever she tells her side of the story. I think it's because she reminds me of my own grandmother who's off telling me what's right and what's wrong ever since I was two years old. (Oh, should I mention that my grandmother wanted me to do whatever she says?)Grounded is a romantic book, although the romance barely appears between the two main characters (Jake and Annie). I'm not sure what is another good genre to name it, but that's pretty much it. Grounded is not recommended to another under fourteen. The beginning of Grounded goes by fast. I sometimes had to go back to previous pages to check what I know so far. It's damn annoying when you have to do that, especially when you're trying to go through a two hundred page book in just a few hours. The plot is fast-paced, so be prepared to be lost once in awhile because the plot is just fast!The ending of Grounded is completely unsatisfactory. Everything seems to be quickly wrapped up by the author, as if the author is eagered to end Grounded. Nevertheless, Grounded ending is just the ending. Nothing quite happened out of the extraordinary. And the things that did happen out of the extraordinary happened too quickly to even be considered surprising. There's not much character development. I don't see any good characters to root for in this book. (The author tries to make this book look like A Year Down Yonder, I'm afraid).

Life couldn\u2019t be better. Then suddenly she discovers that Stuart isn\u2019t quite what he seems, and before the shock has worn away, life deals her another blow \u2013 she\u2019s been laid off as a result of her company\u2019s acquisition. Now she\u2019s alone, homeless, out of work, and with nowhere else to turn, she rents a car and drives from New York City to Somerville, Kentucky, back to her childhood home and the grandmother who raised her. With her future uncertain, she\u2019s forced to grapple with the life and the people that she left behind, and over time she realizes that maybe this is the very place she was meant to be all along.On the cover of Grounded is this quote from Nancy Sleeth: \u201cCorrell\u2019s debut novel is nothing less than Southern comfort food for the soul.\u201d This sentiment stuck with me and proved to be a perfect description of the feel of the book. While the story is fairly predictable \u2013 think rediscovering and learning to appreciate the rural farm life and reconnecting with her childhood best friend, Jake \u2013 it still just feels so good to read. The writing is interesting and engaging, the characters quirky and lovable, and the ending warm and wholesome. Having grown up in rural Arkansas myself, raised primarily by my grandparents, the story was identifiable for me and that most certainly contributed to my fondness for it. Still, I think that most (Southerners, in particular) will find this book quite enjoyable, light enough to breeze through, but with the substance to make it a worthwhile read."}, {"userName": "Lianne", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/990839-lianne", "userReview": "Grounded is a pretty light, easy read. It\u2019s a bit of a slow read which in a way reflects the way of life that Annie\u2019s grandmother and her community live in. The contrast is definitely stark in comparison to Annie\u2019s New York City, jet-setting life, which only lasted some three chapters. I wished we spent a bit more time in her life before the move back home just to establish where she is in her life, her plans and her desires. The message about going back to your roots, that less is more and how the world these days is too much based on \u201cwants\u201d to really appreciate what we do already have and the good things in life\u2013family, friends, people who care about you, good food and good times\u2013is very much prominent in this novel. At the same time though I did find it a tad bit preachy at times.There are however some good themes and stories present in the overall plot that I wished had been more fleshed out. I wasn\u2019t thoroughly convinced by Annie\u2019s turn of heart that led to her change of relationship with her grandmother (I thought it was a little too sudden, too early in the story). I was also under the impression that Annie and Jake\u2019s reconnection would\u2019ve been one of the forefront plots in the novel. Yes, they hung out a few times both before Camille\u2019s arrival and after but the romance element seemed almost like background noise to everything else and popped up at the end, which left me rather unsatisfied. Overall Grounded was pretty straightforward; there\u2019s nothing too intense or overly emotional about the novel so there\u2019s nothing that\u2019ll stress you out or yank you on a roller coaster ride of emotions. At the same time the character development could have been more fleshed out but otherwise it was a nice novel.You can read this review in its entirety over at caffeinatedlife.net: http://www.caffeinatedlife.net/blog/2..."}, {"userName": "Karna", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9843605-karna", "userReview": "First, I would like to say that I received this book for free through Goodreads First Reads. Although, it was free, my review will be totally honest.Second, this is not normally the type of book I read. I usually read science fiction/fantasy, mystery, horror, dystopia, young adult, etc. This book is contemporary, and I really enjoyed it.I enjoyed all the characters. I thought they were well written, and in my mind, I could see each one of them. Annie is a stewardess on an airline that gets bought out, and she gets laid off. She founds out her boyfriend is not who she thinks she is, and she breaks it off. So, she decides to go home to stay at her grandmother Beulah's in Kentucky. Annie was raised by her grandparents when her mother died. Annie's grandfather has passed away as well.Her grandmother is a typical southern woman, and Annie believes that she is very modern. It was so fun to read about what they taught each other. My great grandmother was born in Kentucky. She died when I was almost 12 years old. I remember her well, and many of the things Beulah did, I remember my great grandmother doing. My great grandmother was always cooking and baking, and although she didn't have room for a garden, she always had little pots growing on her kitchen sink.Grounded brought my childhood back to me. It made me feel like I had gone home to visit family. Family is so important in my life, and this book made me remember those things that I enjoyed when I was young.

Although that was not the focus of the book, these ideals are used by the main character to help refocus her life. As a Southerner, half raised by my grandparents doing many of these same things, I felt a real connection to Annie. I, too, went off and tried to make my way in the world, only to realize being back home was the only place I really wanted to be.As Annie\u2019s life seems to fall to pieces around her, she decides to move home and try to reconnect with the grandmother who helped raise her after her mother passed. Annie and her grandmother must now learn to live with each other without her grandpa as a buffer. Along the way, she also reconnects with her childhood friend, Jake Wilder, who has some serious life decisions of his own to make. Their connection rekindles some old feelings that make both of them rethink the future.Their journeys offer insight into what is really important throughout this life and how our priorities can so easily be neglected along the way. It is a charming summer read that will not only teach you some family lessons, it will also teach a few about good \u2018ole country living with a heaping helping of southern charm and hospitality.

It's all about going back to your roots. From country girl to the city back to the country, Annie is finding out what her heart really wants. She's a flight attendant who not only gets grounded, but she loses her apartment and finds out her boyfriend is a creep. She has no where else left to go, so she goes back home to the farm.There, she finds her grandmother, the farm is deep disrepair, a stranger living in the stone house and her ex, Jake Wilder, wanting to marry a girl who Annie doesn't think is right for him. She also realizes that the feelings she thought were gone for Jake are still there. Jake's been climbing the corporate ladder and his fiance, Camille, wants him to go into their family hotel business. Jake knows his passion is farming though, he just needs to work some things out.Annie urges her grandmother to sell the farm, but it falls on deaf ears. She and Jake are amicable and he doesn't realize how her feelings have changed. She wants to tell him that Camille is the wrong girl for him but she doesn't want to overstep her bounds. But will she stay or will she return to the big city when a new company takes over? Grounded is a clean, entertaining novel about memorable characters and a slice of time in their lives. Annie's grandma was my favorite - she's so bossy and she does carry a gun! But Annie and Jake are also wonderful characters and I quite enjoyed their time together. Grounded is a charming debut with a solid storyline and the pages just fly by.

As the summer moves on, Annie begins to wonder about her future and if New York is really where she belongs. My Review:I started this book and could not put it down. The beautiful country described throughout the book was also found in my dreams. I loved that Annie\u2019s Grandmother lived in the same house and kept the traditions and ways of Annie\u2019s childhood alive. Angela Correll portrayed the differences in family members perfectly with the tension between Annie and her Grandmother. Even with the tension you could feel the love and respect between them. This book has everything you would want in a book. A tad of romance, lots of family and friends, a ripple of mystery, and lots of lessons to learn can be found within these pages. As a debut novel Angela Correll wrote a perfect book.

Annie is a charming character throughout the story, starting with her enviable jetsetting lifestye at the beginning of the book all the way up until the ending at which point she has simplified her life significantly. Although it wasn't an easy road for her, the story had a happy ending--my favorite kind!The story begins in New York City. Annie is leading a fast-paced life, working as a flight attendant and travelling the world. She has an apartment and a boyfriend who makes plenty of money. Seemingly, Annie has it all. Then she finds out that her boyfriend isn't so perfect and that her job is no longer.She returns to her roots in Kentucky. Her only family there is her grandmother with whom she has a rocky relationship. Annie left Kentucky as soon as she could, so she is a bit reluctant to go back.

Annie re-discovers her faith, mends her relationship with her grandmother, and develops a real love for farm life.

She contemplates going back to New York after she arrives but she then realizes she must make tough decisions about whether to stay or whether to go back. This book is about love, loss, heartache, family, roots, anger, forgiveness, pride, and community. This is Angela Correll's debut novel and it was very good.
