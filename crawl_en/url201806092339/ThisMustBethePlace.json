Oh, the writing was brilliant right from the start, but anyone reading my reviews knows how frustrating I find jumping timelines. This book does it alot, the past, the present, the future, sometimes skipping several years and introducing new characters. At the heart this is the story of Claudette and Daniel, fell in love with Daniel in all his maddening humanness, but was worried that the way this was written would keep me from getting closer to understanding the characters. But in this author's capable hands it all worked for me, I could see how amazingly she built this story, that eventually all, even that which seemed unnecessary at the time, has meaning and taken together I felt I received a wonderful look at two people and their marriage.,What struck me about this book is how flawed these people were, so real, the pasts that took them to the present, and the roadblocks, the unexpected role of fate, and how it can derail even the best intentioned. How difficult it is to overcome these twists and how despairing a person can become, how hard to look positive at a future. It was their very real humanness and very realistic problems and happenings that made me love this book. The characters, even the lesser characters were amazing, all coping with very real life and its incidentals. Loved the children, even their personalities were wonderfully formed, their defects very real. At books end I felt I was given a very insightful look at a marriage, at two lives, how they were formed and the mistakes and triumphs of full if not always happy lives lived. This author is a true treasure.ARC from publisher."}, {"userName": "Angela M", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4685500-angela-m", "userReview": "I wish I could adequately describe how brilliantly Maggie O'Farrell portrays relationships - these love stories. I was first introduced to Maggie O'Farrell's writing in The Hand That First Held Mine and I was taken at first page and then all over again when I read The Vanishing Act of Esme Lennox. There is something about how this woman open her novels , something about the writing that draws me in and then her characters and their stories take over my life for a few days. What was different with this book for me, at first was that I didn't connect with the characters right away - a married couple , Daniel , living in a secluded house in Donegal, Ireland with his wife , Claudette and their children . The narratives alternate between them at first but then there are multiple narrators in different places - New York , London , San Francisco, India, and more , at different times and not in chronological order. Somehow I wasn't confused . I got what was happening when and where but I felt at a distance for a while from these characters . At some point , I think it was from the narrative of Daniel's daughter Phoebe, from his first marriage , onwards that I felt that same intimate, in their thoughts , connection that I felt with characters in other books by O'Farrell . The shifting from past to present felt familiar because it is similar to shifts in time the aforementioned books. It is a technique that affords the reader the ability to stay in the present with the characters while giving us insight into how they got here. But it's more than just the shifting times. There are characters other than Daniel and Claudette that I connected with - their children, but it isn't really their stories . It's how and when they are a part of Daniel and Claudette's past that divulges more and more about them that makes these chapters meaningful. Through all of the time shifts and changes in narrators, you end up with in depth character studies which touch your emotions as well as your intellect. These complex characters make for complex relationships and this is what made them feel so much like real people and real things in our lives . This is about a couple , about their pasts and the secrets they carry, about remorse, about personal crises , about coping with grief , about how all of this shapes who they are as individuals and who they are together . They are not perfect and there is plenty about them not to like, but yet I couldn't help caring about these two essentially good people and their children . Maggie O'Farrell is a master at creating stories that will keep you feeling and thinking throughout. Highly recommended!I am grateful to Knopf and FirstToRead program for the opportunity to read this advance copy and especially to Maggie O'Farrell who has become one of my favorite authors ."}, {"userName": "Elyse", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse", "userReview": "This story starts off with a BANG....literally a \u2018bang\u2019! It was such a strong beginning\u2014 twice my cell phone went off - personal calls coming in - I seriously debated about answering. One of those calls - I didn\u2019t pick up.But then something happened to MY ENJOYMENT- I didn\u2019t understand what was happening. The story changed on me so quickly - new characters were introduced and I found myself resisting reading about them. I was still back with the first story.So....I did something that worked beautiful for me:FIRST....I made myself something to eat. I was hungry. SECOND...I turned on the computer and read some reviews. ( both on Amazon and Goodreads...\u2019only\u2019 long enough to grasp an understanding about the structure of the writing - and see if I could pick up a few tips which might help my own reading. And sure enough.... I found just what I needed. Once I had a better understanding and context of how to read this book, I felt more at ease. I felt more prepared. I felt I needed the crutch and support from other readers when I hit the wall of confusion.....I no longer felt I was climbing a mountain in the dark. I knew a \u2018few\u2019 things from readers of what I might expect - and it helped!I made some tea....settled in, and was \u2018really\u2019 thankful to ALL THE OTHER READERS WHO CAME BEFORE ME.....YOUR REVIEWS made a difference.! At times I still felt a little jolted with the transitions from a current story to a back story - from the 1980\u2019s to the 1990\u2019s.....but I got use to it.....[NOTE: this is my first book by Maggie O\u2019Farrell].....but once I got into EACH story....with EACH of the different characters ....I was fully hooked .....again, and again, - really caring about all these many people. The heart of the story belongs to Daniel, a linguist, and Claudette, once a film star, who live in Donegal, Ireland. They are living a recluse lifestyle. They have a 6 year old daughter and baby boy. Claudette, has an older son from years before, by one of her movie directors. Daniel, American born, is about to fly to Brooklyn for his father\u2019s 90th birthday party.Daniel has two other children who live in California, a failed first marriage- and another woman in his past who plagues his thoughts. We take a journey with Daniel......meeting a cast of characters who each live with challenges and troubles. Daniel has been carrying around a secret for years. The title of this book is is terrific. For me ...it guided stimulating thoughts of HOME, BE HERE NOW, THE PAST, THE FUTURE, and.....THIS *MUST* BE THE PLACE.There is soooooo much going on in this novel: haunting and hilarious- warm & real with flawed characters - sad - quirky- love-family - marriage- illness - secrets- forgiveness-gently pulling on our heartstrings throughout. A ONE OF A KIND NOVEL! A saga of sorts ...but very unique crafting. I\u2019ll definitely read more books by Maggie O\u2019Farrell. 4.8 .....a couple of points off for feeling a little too jolted at times during transitions."}, {"userName": "Dem", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2752994-dem", "userReview": "I am a fan of Maggie O' Farrell's novels but this book was all over the place for me and I just didn't come to grips with any of the characters or the constant shifts in time and place. I find O' Farrells writing normally quirky and engaging but this book left me feeling frustrated the further along I read. I found the story so disjointed that picking up the book felt like a chore and the only reason I did finish the book was because of the prose. I didn't engage with the plot or the characters and couldn't find a sense of time or place in the novel. It wasn't as intriguing or satisfying as her previous works and I felt the storyline was weak and had no direction. One of my all time favourite books was The Vanishing Act of Esme Lennox\nMaggie O'Farrell which I found captivating and as intricately written.I had saved This Must Be the Place for my holidays hoping for another experience of The Vanishing Act of Esme Lennox but sadly I was left feeling disappointed.My thanks to Net Galley for the opportunity to read this advance copy in return for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Helene Jeppesen", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21992464-helene-jeppesen", "userReview": "This was a wonderful book about life and the struggles we all have to face. What I particularly liked about it is that it jumps in perspective, time and place. At one point, we're at a crossroads in rural Ireland, at another point, we find ourselves in America 20 years ago. \"This Must Be the Place\" makes for a puzzling, however very much intriguing tale about a movie star who once disappeared, about marriage, and about identity, guilt, and doubt.

It\u2019s more like a collection of stories than your typical novel. Each chapter is told by a different character and from a different time period. The stories all tend to revolve around Daniel Sullivan, a linguistics professor living in Ireland with his second wife, an ex-actress in hiding. The stories coalesce to fill in Daniel\u2019s story. The chapter titles keep you on track as to time and place, so you aren't confused. Daniel is not a sympathetic character. He\u2019s a womanizer, also an egotist, unaware of anyone else's feelings but his own. His first wife leaves him and denies him access to his children. As you learn more about his backstory, you can understand the anger that probably led her to do that. His second wife, Claudette, is a real character, as in a bit bonkers. But you can feel sympathy for her. But I give credit to O\u2019Farrell. Her characters are complex, three dimensional folks that you can easily picture. I did get a kick over how many words I had to look up, given that the main character in the book is a linguist. The writing is very good, the stories are interesting. But I can't say this book really grab me until far along. I can't decide if my initial dislike for Daniel was the reason it took me a while to connect with the book. In the final analysis, I\u2019d rate this 3.5 stars, rounding up to 4."}, {"userName": "Rebecca Foster", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca-foster", "userReview": "Maggie O\u2019Farrell\u2019s globe-trotting seventh novel opens in 2010 with Daniel Sullivan, an American linguistics professor in Donegal. Spreading outward from Ireland and reaching into every character\u2019s past and future, this has all O\u2019Farrell\u2019s trademark insight into family and romantic relationships, as well as her gorgeous prose and precise imagery. The disparate locations and the title suggest our nomadic modern condition. It\u2019s the widest scope she has attempted yet; that\u2019s both a good and a bad thing. I did wonder if there were a few too many characters and plot threads.I have always felt that O\u2019Farrell expertly straddles the (perhaps imaginary) line between literary and popular fiction; her books are addictively readable but also hold up to critical scrutiny.See my full review at The Bookbag.Related reading: The Hand That First Held Mine is, to my mind, O\u2019Farrell\u2019s masterpiece.

The story of a man, Daniel Sullivan, reveals both the good and the bad sides of him, the joys and sorrows and what motivates him. The story is divided into chapters narrated by many different people who have impacted his life in so many ways. The book also skips throughout time from 1944 to 2016 but is quite easy to follow. What emerges is a well developed story of a man. When Daniel meets Claudette he has one major failed relationship and a failed marriage behind him. He is the father of two children who he rarely sees because of his ex-wife's actions. Claudette is a famous actress who has fled the limelight and is in hiding in rural Donegal, Ireland. She has a son with a stuttering problem. The two fall in love and have two children together. It sounds like a chick lit book but it's not. It's so much more. Daniel is a linguist and loves words. He loves how they're used and why people select and use the words they do. He teaches in colleges and lectures as a guest speaker. The love of words is apparent throughout the book. The language is resonate and nuanced. It was just pure pleasure. I first heard of this author when I was on a trip to Bigger, Scotland where she was doing a reading. Always a fine author, she has grown and developed as an author and this is, by far, her best yet. This is a book for people who love a good story told in a delightful, different way.

Then she did look and the same sensations hit again, like a row of dominoes toppling into each other: the towering sense of recognition, the disbelief that she doesn\u2019t somehow know him, the ridiculousness that they do not know each other, the impossibility of them not seeing each other again\u201dThis Must Be The Place is the seventh novel by British author, Maggie O\u2019Farrell. Claudette Wells is Daniel Sullivan\u2019s second wife. Even after several years of living together in a remote corner of Donegal, and fathering two children with her, he still finds it hard to believe that this eccentric, occasionally crazy, reclusive and beautiful ex-film star ever agreed to marry him. Later, he will remember this, and wonder what possessed him to put all that at risk. But now, a chance snippet of a radio broadcast, heard on the way to the train, sets him on a path to his past.Daniel heads off to New York, to his (not at all beloved) father\u2019s 90th birthday party, makes an unplanned detour to California see the son and daughter from whom he has been kept for nine years by a vindictive ex-wife, then detours again to Sussex. What he learns there has such a profound effect on him, it threatens to derail the best thing in his life. O\u2019Farrell has done it again! This extended family, this cast of characters, they pull the reader in. She draws each of them so well, with all their flaws and foibles, that the reader cannot help but find them appealing, hoping that things will turn out okay for them, laughing with them when they do and shedding a tear or two when they don\u2019t. The story is told by many different characters: the perspective of some is given numerous times; others share their perceptions only once; conveniently, each chapter is clearly marked with the character and the time period; as well as contributing to the main story, these alternate views give vignettes of other, associated lives; most are conventional first-person or third-person narratives, but there is a second-person one, one with footnotes, a transcript of an interview, and even an auction catalogue with images; the chapter headings are phrases lifted from the text therein, producing a tiny resonance when they are read in context. O\u2019Farrell\u2019s descriptive prose is wonderfully evocative: \u201cAn amount of time later \u2013 he isn\u2019t sure exactly how much \u2013 Daniel is walking in through the gates of the cemetery. He comes here at least once a day. It gives him an aim, a kind of routine. He makes his way along the gravelled path, letting his eye rest on the hundreds and hundreds of gravestones, watching the way they pull themselves into diagonal columns as he passes, then unpeel themselves, then line up again. An endless process of arrangement and disarrangement\u201d is one example.\u201cHe thinks of his grief over his sister as an entity that is horribly and painfully attached to him, the way a jellyfish might adhere to your skin or a goitre or an abscess. He pictures it as viscid, amorphous, spiked, hideous to behold. He finds it unbelievable that no one else can see it. Don\u2019t mind that, he would say, it\u2019s just my grief. Please ignore it and carry on with what you were saying\u201d is another example.Fans of O\u2019Farrell\u2019s earlier novels will not be disappointed. Readers new to her work are sure to seek out her backlist.

This novel encompasses several characters and various time periods and viewpoints. However, central to the book is Daniel Sullivan, a New Yorker transplanted to Donegal who teaches linguistics at the University of Belfast and lives with the reclusive actress Claudette Wells.Daniel has already had two major failed relationships in his life by the time he meets Claudette; including a bitter divorce which sees him lost contact with the two children from his first marriage. Now as settled as it is possible to be with the unpredictable Claudette, he returns to New York for the 90th birthday party of his father and, after hearing some news from his past, sets off on a journey which puts his current marriage in jeopardy. Of course, O\u2019Farrell writes beautifully. She weaves her storyline and characters in a simply masterful way; incorporating the pasts and viewpoints of everyone from Claudette, the children of their various relationships, a PA during Claudette\u2019s time in LA and others, including Daniel\u2019s mother. She reveals her character\u2019s secret, internal life, and also highlights what is really important in modern families and relationships. This novel has drama, tension and deep insight.

Daniel, however, has an ex-wife and two kids living in California, kids he hasn't seen since he walked out on them years ago. He decides to return to New York, his first visit for several years, to attend his father's 90th birthday party. He's doing this with a certain amount of reluctance, but whilst there, why not just nip across to California and meet these estranged kids. So far, so good. This book gets off to a really good start with Daniel narrating with dark, wry humour. Great, thought I, settling down for an enjoyable few hours. Unfortunately that warm fuzzy feeling I get when immersed in a Really Good Book didn't last. Now I don't mind stories that hop between past and present, and I don't mind stories in which each character takes a chapter and tells it like it is from his/her point of view, but this \u2013 this is so disjointed it's like climbing uphill through an avalanche. It's not just back and forth between two timelines, it's all over the place with no apparent rhythm or pattern. So many characters, so many seemingly unconnected tales of woe, I couldn't get a firm grip on anything. The style in that wonderful opening chapter disappeared and it felt as if the rest of the book has been written by a different author. To say the author has lost the plot just about sums it up.If you're new to Maggie O'Farrell I suggest you try some of her earlier books \u2013 leave this one and possibly Instructions For a Heatwave off your to-read list.

The characters are larger than life, and you cannot help but falling in love with their beauty and frailties. Claudette, the gamin and ethereal reclusive movie star; Daniel, a rumpled handsome linguist, oddly inarticulate and passive against the tumult of his life, their children from other marriages and this one, both gifts and impetus for growth...friends, workmates, other family members...move in and out, back and forth through their story. How do we find our way through the messiness that can be life? Imperfectly, as Daniel and Claudette learn on their way to finding each other, knowing each other and themselves.

I\u2019ve read and enjoyed Instructions for a Heatwave, The Hand That First Held Mine, and The Vanishing Act of Esme Lennox. But THIS book\u2026oh, this book.The hub of it is Daniel Sullivan, a damaged American linguist professor, who chances upon a reclusive film star Claudette Wells and her son \u2013 a stutterer \u2013 while collecting his grandfather\u2019s ashes in Ireland. Not unlike the book Olive Kitteridge, the book proceeds in chapters of interlocking stories; we meet his children, her son, the children they have together, her brother and his wife, her ex, and so forth.Just about every person we meet is burdened with an onerous challenge. His older son is tortured by eczema; her son emotionally suffers from stuttering. There is infertility, anorexia, symbiosis, alcoholism\u2026yet in a great feat of writing, the characters rise above their condition rather than be defined by it. These are misplaced and lost characters, searching for their authentic place within themselves. Their searching leads to external travels and internal jaunts (at one point, Daniel thinks, \u201cI am not going to drop myself down, like a speleologist, into those holes and caverns and start digging around,\u201d but of course, he does.) They are searching: for love, for connection, for identity, for affirmation, for understanding. Eventually, they will learn a simple life lesson: \u201cWe must pursue what\u2019s in front of us, not what we can\u2019t have or what we have lost. We must grasp what we can reach and hold on, fast.\u201dI won\u2019t go into the specifics of plot, except to say that the plot organically unfolds in the most satisfying manner. As a reader, I believed in and cared about every single one of these characters. The writing is accessible and elegant. I do believe that most, if not all, chapters could stand alone as short stories, yet the whole is so much greater than the sum of its parts. At times, I marveled how Maggie O\u2019Farrell could capture an emotion \u2013 a complex thought \u2013 in just a few well-chosen words. Maggie O\u2019Farrell, to my mind, was always a good writer.

Orbits collide and you run into the most alluring stranger. A certain dizziness takes hold, a breathlessness. There is an instant connection - from their easy smile and twinkling eyes, they seem happy to be in your company too. You suddenly need to know everything about this person you've never met before, you want to tell them things you've never told anybody else. Your heart is pounding - are you brave enough to take things further? Or will you slouch away and spend the rest of your life wondering about what might have been?This Must Be The Place is built upon two such meetings. The first happens in a remote corner of Donegal, Ireland. Claudette Wells, a reclusive Oscar-winning actress, stands on a country road with her young son Ari, their car immobilised by a flat tyre. Daniel Sullivan, a linguist from Brooklyn, is in the area to scatter his grandfather's ashes. He stumbles upon this scene and comes to their aid. There is an immediate attraction - Daniel is completely smitten, Claudette is intrigued by this charming man who is so at ease with her son. Years later they are married with two more children. But Daniel has dark secrets in his past that eventually surface and threaten the existence of their unlikely relationship.The second fateful encounter is described halfway through the book. It's New York, 1944 - long before Daniel has been born. His mother Teresa, a librarian, is already engaged to his father but on the subway one evening she bumps into Johnny Demarco, a handsome Italian-American gentleman. Their chemistry is undeniable, they both feel it. A few days later, he comes to the building where she works to tell her that he searched every library in Brooklyn to find her. Before he can go on she lets him know that she has promised herself to another. Years pass and they meet again on a ferry - Teresa has a young Daniel with her. Johnny tells her that he thinks about her every day, that he wished he'd grabbed her that afternoon at the library and never let her go. Teresa nods. \"We made our choices and we have to live with them,\" she says. She will play that first subway meeting over in her head almost every day of her life and think about Johnny even on her deathbed.This is an ambitious novel - 28 sprawling chapters told by multiple narrators from locations as far-flung as India and Bolivia. Some of these characters I loved. The plight of Daniel's son Niall broke my heart on more than one occasion. Born with a chronic skin disease, he is a caring and thoughtful person who endures more than his fair share of suffering (I've since learned that Maggie O'Farrell's own daughter is affected by a similar ailment, which she wrote poignantly about here). Rosalind is another memorable and likable individual - she imparts some valuable marriage advice to Daniel when he needs it most. Other characters I felt did not deserve their own chapter. Others still I believe we did not learn enough about (Daniel's daughter Phoebe for example).Ultimately the large cast is spread a little thin and the novel is just too long-winded for its own good. By losing some of the secondary characters it would have focused the story better. This Must Be The Place works best when it examines the intricacies of marriage - the care and attention it needs, the sacrifices that must be made, the immeasurable happiness it can bring. But above all, it seems to say, you need the courage to make that chance of true love happen, or else spend the rest of your days thinking about the one that got away."}, {"userName": "K.D.

It might be a little discombobulating at first to be taken across different decades and continents within just a few pages but even though the characters and timelines seem random, there is a structure bonding the story together, like invisible glue, so that even though you may be in 1989 in one chapter and then in 2010 the next, the story and chapters flow effortlessly and connect together. And then of course there is Maggie O\u2019Farrell\u2019s writing. No waffly or unnecessary words \u2013 just beautiful, succinct and carefully worded prose that you read and can immediately understand and think \u201cyes I get that\u201d. The characters of both Daniel and Claudette may well make you want to shake them at times. To say to them, \u201cjust damn well talk to each other\u201d but it\u2019s their flaws and their complex characters which make them just so believable. Daniel, the linguistics expert who so often throughout his life seems to press the self-destruct button. He understands the complexities of language but cannot find the right words to say at the right time which leads to missed opportunities and misunderstandings. Then there is his wife Claudette, the reclusive former film star. She is fiercely protective of her privacy to the point of paranoia and hides her vulnerability behind her stubborn exterior. There are many other connecting characters, some family members, others complete strangers (one of my favourite quotes in the book comes from Rosalind, a character who was just \u2018passing through\u2019 but one that I would like to have heard more from), but all have their own stories and heartbreaks which impact on Daniel and Claudette\u2019s lives. I really don\u2019t want to go into any detail about the story and the book description will give you the outline, it is one that you need to read and discover for yourself whilst immersing yourself in the beauty of this author\u2019s writing. I was completely captivated and intrigued by the epic journey made by these characters; there is both tragedy and humour; This Must be the Place will undoubtedly be on the list for my top books of the year."}, {"userName": "Fictionophile ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4428094-fictionophile", "userReview": "For my seventh and final read of the 2018 'Reading Ireland' challenge, I thought I'd try an author I've heard a lot about.\u00a0 I'd never read any of her work before, but after this one Maggie O'Farrell will be on my list of favourite authors.First of all I'd like to warn potential readers that this is a novel that has many characters, all fully developed. It also has several time lines which jump back and forth.\u00a0 Some will not care for this.\u00a0 Although a few times I found it disconcerting, I found that each character was written with such empathy that while reading their story I didn't want their tale to end.\u00a0 My favourite scenes though, were those set in the rural Donegal landscape.Daniel Sullivan, the protagonist of this novel is a multi-faceted character. He is a tall, larger than life American. The only boy in a family of strong women, he has grown to appreciate women - sometimes too much so...\u00a0 He is the hub of the story.\u00a0 All the other characters are strategically important peripherals - they are all relevant to Daniel and his extraordinary life.\u00a0 His college friends, his girlfriends, his children, his mother, his wife.\"Daniel was one of those people whom others follow\".They all have such an impact on Daniel - and the story, that I wouldn't know how to begin to summarize the plot for you (which is why I included the publisher's summation in this instance).\u00a0 Just know that Daniel is fabulous - though not without some rather serious flaws.\u00a0 He is a linguist. His love of words and the English language would endear him to me right from the start. He is a charming womanizer - though to be fair he often doesn't seem to realize this himself.\u00a0 He loves deeply. He is an amazing father. He is also prone to substance abuse and is riddled by guilt... He never really got over the death of his mother.I want everyone to read this book!\u00a0 The characters.... well they are so REAL.\u00a0 Claudette, the beautiful movie star who has escaped run away to a remote house in Donegal. A house so remote that there are twelve farm gates that need to be opened and then shut again if you want to drive the half a mile it takes to get to the road. A woman of relentless energy, a passionate lover and an amazing mother to her children whom she home-schools.\"Whatever had happened, she had pulled off the thing that people of her ilk must dream about all the time: she'd left her life, she'd pulled the plug, she'd disappeared. And I had found her.\"Ari, Claudette's oldest son. A boy whose dibilitating stutter is soothed by Daniel's interest and his attempts at speech therapy.Claudette's brother Lucas and his wife Maeve - and the effect of childlessness on their lives.Teresa, Daniel's mother - and unrequited love.In America, Daniel has left behind a son and a daughter after losing a custody battle with his first wife. Niall, Daniel's oldest son, who lives with a serious case of exema. So much so that he must bandage his body to keep from scratching himself raw. Phoebe, Daniel's eldest daughter, a beautiful smart girl with a fierce and unadulterated love for her brother Niall.Then, there are Daniel and Claudette's two children, Marithe and Calvin. Marithe who is the doppleganger of her American half-sister, Phoebe. Calvin, still a baby.All is going well, until Daniel hears a familiar voice on the radio. His past sins come back to haunt him. He takes himself off to investigate his own past not knowing that this act will forever change his life.\u00a0 It will destroy his marriage and instigate a downward spiral...This is the story of an unforgettable family. Of love, of loss, of tribulation. Of fate, of life.\u00a0\"What redemption there is in being loved: we are always our best selves when loved by another. Nothing can replace this.\"I believe this would be a great choice for a bookclub. The novel's many characters and strong writing would generate some lively discussion.\u00a0 To facilitate discussion, the publisher has kindly provided a Reading Group Guide for \"This must be the place\".I waffled about the rating for this one. Mostly due to the oftentimes disconcerting jump between characters and time periods.\u00a0 I rated it a 4/5 then changed it to 4.5/5 because I loved the characters so much. Then after finishing - I knew that since it made such and impact on me, and that I would remember it for a long time, I had no choice but to change my rating to 5 stars.\u00a0 I look forward to reading more by this highly talented author. Literary fiction at its finest.I received a digital copy of this novel for free, at my request, from Knopf via Edelweiss."}, {"userName": "Joy D", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50297885-joy-d", "userReview": "After a protracted and ugly custody battle, Daniel, the protagonist, travels to Ireland, where he meets a reclusive famous ex-actress with a young son. They form a relationship, and this book provides insight to the mistakes and fateful happenings of their lives. Daniel\u2019s past catches up to him, he makes many poor decisions, and finds himself in a downward spiral. O'Farrell shows the beauty, flaws, and foibles of intimate relationships.Overall, I liked it, but its structure adversely impacted my enjoyment. This book was like a jigsaw puzzle, with bits and pieces of the main characters\u2019 lives introduced through chapters that jump forward and backward through time, and are told from numerous different points of view, with each chapter imparting a small portion of essential information. At first, I liked putting the puzzle pieces together, but it became tiresome after a while. I thought it would have flowed much better without being transported to new locations without warning and having to reestablish in my mind which characters were in what relationships at that time. The many timelines and extraneous narrators did not even seem necessary, though I\u2019m sure the author had a reason. On a positive note, the author writes in an elegant, sophisticated manner, so I will likely read another of her books. If you don\u2019t mind the mental gymnastics needed to keep track of the storyline, and enjoy tales of family dynamics, then you may enjoy this book. Contains profanity, infidelity, abortion, drug use, and addiction."}, {"userName": "Cynthia Corral", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3793206-cynthia-corral", "userReview": "Talk about difficult to rate.It's well written, it grabbed me from the beginning, I was really excited about this book as I read more and more.And then it all just started dragging for me.I don't ever mind books that go back and forth in time, and I actually *love* books that switch narrators often. But switching narrators AND going back and forth and front and back and sideways in time, this was a little more difficult.In the end, I don't understand the point of the time flipping. There were no real questions that were resolved in an interesting way. It was just confusing trying to remember who was married to whom at any particular time and who had yet to meet the other.What was the point of the man who loved Daniel's mother? That tangent was just left out there, abandoned.Timou was just dropped and left. Nicola, such an important character through much of the book, was also just dropped and abandoned.I'm not going to argue with anyone who gave this five stars, because I was wholly on board for half this book, and so maybe I just didn't personally connect with it. But my enjoyment of this book started dragging at the halfway point, and it became a chore to pick up the book and continue. I started questioning the point of any of it. Wondering what exactly the plot is. Debating who the book is supposed to be about and if I really care what happens.And in the end, I didn't. I just didn't care.Four stars because it's undeniably well written. But I'm left not really caring if I never see this book again.Thank you to the Penguin First-to-Read program for the advance copy of this book."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5010988-laura", "userReview": "What a stunning, beautiful book.This Must be the Place is the story of a marriage. Yet is it so much more.Daniel and Claudette are flawed humans. Yet they might also be reincarnations of ancient gods. Their every action has lifelong and far-flung consequences, shaping the lives of everyone they encounter. They disregard mundane niceties and rules. Their carelessness results in life and death. It is easy to think of them as terrible, awful, selfish creatures. But if you love them, if they are the center of your universe, then you forgive them most everything, and yearn for the warmth thrown off by their embrace.Daniel is an American professor of linguistics. He has two children in California he doesn't speak to (Niall and Phoebe), a family in Brooklyn he barely keeps in touch with, and lives in County Donegal with Claudette and their two children, Marithe & Calvin. He wound up in this situation by coming to Ireland to find his grandfather's cremains. HIs grandfather had died on a trip to Ireland; his grandmother had had him cremated there and then; and she left him there. When she died, he found out his grandfather was nowhere to be found. Since he couldn't solve the problem of keeping his children near him, he set out to solve the whereabouts of his grandfather. He found him; he went to retrieve him; and in doing so, he found Claudette and her son.Claudette is an French-English actress who faked her and her son's death, and fled her husband and life a few years before for anonymity. She was fiercely protecting her privacy when Daniel came to help her change a flat tire. But she was undone by his kindness to her stuttering son, Ari, his ability to address Ari's needs and still treat him as a fun-loving boy. The two come together, and create a family and a life.It's all going well enough until Daniel heads to Brooklyn for his father's 90th birthday. He hears an ex-girlfriend on the radio, and finds out she died, perhaps on the last day he saw her. Daniel is rocked with grief, and decides it's time for him to knit together all the threads of his life he has left strewn around the globe over the past 25 years.This mission both strengthens and undoes Daniel and Claudette's life, and we watch it all unravel and come together. O'Farrell contrasts the story of Claudette and Daniel against the unrequieted love of Daniel's mother's life; the struggles of Claudette's brother, Lucas, and his wife, Maeve; the sad typicality of Rosalind's marriage. The reader may not want the highs and lows that Claudette and Daniel storm through. But this is what happens when you live life bravely. Why do it any other way?There are a lot of births in this story, and a couple deaths. Many lives started, a couple cut short. It seems as if Daniel can start life easily, almost too easily, but he has a hard time keeping these lives attached to his own. Claudette can keep things living, nurturing them. And she inspires loyal devotion that is rare in this world.This book was such a pleasant surprise. I had no idea what a gifted storyteller O'Farrell is. I'm a fan for life now.My thanks to Penguin for this ARC."}, {"userName": "Eileen", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5749945-eileen", "userReview": "At last, a book that lived up to my expectations, after so many disappointments this summer! Maggie O\u2019Farrell\u2019s writing is a delight! How beautifully she conveys the pivotal moments in a life, the longing, the regret, the sense of a path not taken: \u2018She doesn\u2019t know it at the time, but she will think about this moment again and again, the two of them standing on the steps of the subway station, a boy between them, a pool of blood of blood at their feet, trains arriving and departing above their heads. She will play it over and over in her head, almost every day, for the rest of her life. When she lies in the bedroom of her apartment with only hours to live, her daughters bickering in the kitchen, her husband in the front room, weeping or raging . . . . she will think of it again and will know it is perhaps for the last time. After this, she thinks, it will live only in the head of one person, and when he dies it will be gone.\u2019 Reading this author reminds me of exercise; where concentration and focus are key, but the reward is great! I was happy to keep my dictionary nearby. Her technique whereupon each chapter abruptly tangents off on another, seemingly unrelated strand, was challenging, in that I\u2019d been caught up in what had just transpired! However, the author does indeed deliver as the plot unfolds, drawing the reader in more deeply with each departure. Only a writer of extraordinary skill could carry this off.She captures ordinary happenings so well that I often felt inclined to linger, savoring: \u2018I fit my key into the lock, push the door. There is no frantic clatter of dog claws on the hall floorboards, no shriek of children. The house breathes a cold sigh into my face as the door swings shut: the place has a sepulchral silence.\u2019 Just one more example of the resonant prose! Probably familiar to most of us is the sensation of being simultaneously wired and drained, such that sleep is out of the question: \u2018She is tired, down to her bones, soaked right through, like a rag, with exhaustion but she is simultaneously filled with an efflorescent glee, an irrepressible thrill.\u2019 I\u2019m delighted to join the chorus of acclaim for This Must Be the Place, and I do hope she\u2019s already at work on another book!"}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/798978-barbara", "userReview": "This was an e-book I picked up and put down.

The only thing that kept it from 5 stars is I struggled with the sheer number of narrators and the constant flipping back and forth of time periods--2010, 1986, 2003, 1994, etc. I normally love this device but there were so many that other than Daniel and Claudette and Ari and the 2010 and 1986 timelines, it was hard to keep it all straight.

A New Yorker living in the wilds of Ireland, he has children he never sees in California, a father he loathes in Brooklyn, and a wife, Claudette, who is a reclusive ex\u2013film star given to pulling a gun on anyone who ventures up their driveway. Claudette was once the most glamorous and infamous woman in cinema before she staged her own disappearance and retreated to blissful seclusion in an Irish farmhouse. But the life Daniel and Claudette have so carefully constructed is about to be disrupted by an unexpected discovery about a woman Daniel lost touch with twenty years ago. This revelation will send him off-course, far away from wife, children and home. Will his love for Claudette be enough to bring him back?This Must be the Place is a novel about family, identity, and true love: an intimately drawn portrait of a marriage, both the forces that hold it together and the pressures that drive it apart.
