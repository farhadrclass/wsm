This series continues to get better. This is one of the best vampire themed series\u2019 out there. After my disappointment with other series\u2019 losing there touch, I have to say that it is not the case with these books. Everything that initially drew me in is still there and then some. I\u2019ve been in anticipation for this book for a long time, and when I finally got a copy it trumped everything else! There were parts of the story that I figured out, and even though I wanted the novel to end one way, I applaud Mead\u2019s unpredictability. Does that sentence totally contradict itself?? Let me see if I can explain. In my quest to keep this spoiler free it may be more difficult, but here it goes. I knew that something big was going to happen to one of the characters in this novel. The clues where there the foreshadowing was set up wonderfully. And even though I had an idea of what was going to happen, Mead was still able to surprise me in the end. Why? Because, I never really thought she would do it. The ending wasn\u2019t what I wanted I\u2019ll admit that, but I don\u2019t think I would have been happy with it being any other way. One of the reasons I\u2019m such a fan of this novel, besides the extraordinary writing ability of Richelle Mead, is Rose Hathaway. Let me just tell you how much I love Rose. She\u2019s beautiful, smart, confident, she\u2019s a smart ass and she kicks ass. I want to be her. She is one of my all time favorite literary characters.  I absolutely cannot wait to read the rest of this series."}, {"userName": "Shannon", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2016128-shannon", "userReview": "I think I have to assume that something devastating will happen in every series that Mead writes. With this one I was pretty much crying from the last 40 pages until the end. Talk about heartbreaking! I sort of saw what was going to happen coming but it didn't make it any less horrible. I'm actually still feeling the effects of this novel and I had to quickly order the next two books to find out what happens. On the heels of the death of her friend, Rose finds out that she's going to start six weeks of field exercise along with the other senior novices. The problem is though, Rose is seeing ghosts and feeling a terrible rage whenever angered or cornered. Rose had her temper before but something is different about these feelings. And being visited by the dead isn't helping her in going back to living any sort of normal life. Rose has grown up since the incident from the previous book and the people around her take notice. Rose isn't the only one changing though and she has to deal with these circumstances as a new threat from the Strigoi looms. I FLEW through this book. I think I could read about Rose and her friends all day every day and not get bored. Honestly though, I think I feel this way about all of Mead's heroines so I could be biased. I love the characters, the story, the way the world is crafted, and Mead's simple yet effective writing style. This series is miles above any teen series I've come across and it rivals some adult series I've read as well and it's quickly become one of my top favorite series ever. Great addition to the series and I can't wait until my order from Amazon ships!My reviews of books two and four: Frostbite and Blood Promise."}, {"userName": "Maggie", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51318038-maggie", "userReview": "I can't write a proper review for this.

It's like one huge spoiler OMG OMG OMFG so much happened in this book I can't even wrap my mind around it. Rose is having all kinds of issues.

This is making Rose act crazy, angry and at times totally out of control and dangerous. Also Rose is seeing Mason's ghost. Rose thinks she is going crazy, seeing ghosts and all but later finds out that she can see ghost thanks again to being Shadow kissed. She can also sense Strigoi when they are close. On top of all that craziness she is doing her 6 week field test to become a guardian.\nLissa and Adrian are working on their spirit magic. Christian is very unhappy with Lissa and Adrian spending so much time together especially after he finds out that the Queen plans on setting Adrian and Lissa up to marry.

Richelle Mead steps up her game on a number of fronts, in my opinion.Plot, characterization, style, pacing and romance. All of these receive a marked improvement.The VA world becomes more real, relatable and defined. The relationship become more involved, less childish and the main character, Rose, receives a healthy dose of adulthood.I am coming to really enjoy these books. I wouldn't have continued past the first one without the encouragement of Tatiana and her niggling carrot-on-a-stick comment about Adrian.

The whole Strigoi problems, relationships, mystery ghosts, and again relationships there were no pauses and that was very good.Dimitri. I have declared that he is my book boyfriend. He was so serious and focused on his job but you couldn't help but see his true feelings for Rose and that is what made him so much better.Rose Hathway. She is the best female protagonist. Even though she was questioning whether she was crazy or not, she was so strong and was willing and did put so many others before her.The minor characters were pretty cool. I did like Adrian, despite his bad drinking and smoking habits, and I hope that we are able to hear more of him in the rest of the series. I am also glad about Eddie and how he changed over time even though it was a little sad.Speaking of sadness, this book had so many sad parts, especially nearing the end. There was death and don't get me started to who turned Strigoi.

", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4474199-leah", "userReview": "\u2606 \u2605 Spoilers ahead, you have been warned \u2606 \u2605I think this book kind of made me love this series because it went on a level that no other YA book went before and I was very happy about the fact that Richelle Mead took a risk, but looking back in hindsight at this series? I was wrong, terribly wrong but let\u2019s save that for when I do reviews of Spirit Bound and Last Sacrifice, shall we?In Shadow Kiss, Rose is suffering the trauma of the Spokane incident and Mason\u2019s death- which adds another twist: she is able to see his ghost and is connected to the world of the dead. While being haunted by Mason, she is also facing field experience (where the Dhampir novices guard Moroi for 6 weeks while they are tested throughout the time) while creaming over Dimitri (honestly, what did you expect?) and hating on her best friend for no apparent nor valid reason, she torments over choosing between them until of course a tragic event changes everything.I definitely liked the pacing of the book, more so than I did with Frostbite, because something new and interesting was brought up at certain intervals so it kept the reader\u2019s interest so the structure of the plot was pretty good. I also liked how in this book, we delved more into the Spirit element and the shadow-kissed bond- its dark side-effects of mental instability was definitely very interesting to read about as it explained why Rose was able to see ghosts which causes complications and her dark attitude throughout the books. I thought it definitely made the story move forward and I thought that it could be used for a lot of potential in the future books, looking in foresight. (I was wrong about this too, hindsight changes everything, people.) What I also liked was how the Moroi monarchy/politics system worked and we saw how they functioned too when Rose & Lissa travel there to visit Queen Tatiana in the Royal Court.I also love how in this book, there was a multiple storyline going on and each character had their own arc: - e.g. Lissa being with Christian when the Queen wanted her to be paired up with Adrian, causing Christian to be jealous of Adrian whilst Rose having to choose between Lissa and Dimitri (I don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass if you think it\u2019s romance, it isn\u2019t, it\u2019s glorifying hero-worship), how it all intertwines together to create drama (that\u2019s isn\u2019t something like Gossip Girl or Days of Our Lives) that is realistic and not exaggerated is a plus for me, because mostly in YA, there is so much bullshit in the air that I can smell it when turning over the pages.Now on to the characters:- in my honest opinion, Rose seems to be getting more immature & hypocritical as the story goes on. I couldn't handle her angst in this book because it was getting ridiculous! I specifically remember in Vampire Academy, that Rose criticized two guardians that ran off together yet in Shadow Kiss, she constantly complains about how bad her life is, how she can never live her own life and how Lissa is to blame for the situation she is in. If you don\u2019t fucking want to be a guardian then don\u2019t be a guardian- no one is forcing her to become a guardian plus it\u2019s been established that the ones that are guardians who go off and live with humans, get jobs and live a normal life. I just only think she is doing it to impress Dimitri, because Dimitri always seem to appreciate her more if she does something \n\u201cguardian\u201d\n like.She also hates Lissa for not being able to understand how hard it is for her, for fuck\u2019s sake, I know that the bond only works one way but you can still tell her how you fucking feel. That\u2019s what best friends are for, how is she supposed to know if you are \u201csuffering\u201d when you\u2019re acting like a prissy bitch by keeping secrets? I don\u2019t see what hardships she is facing, she was brought up with Lissa\u2019s family who welcomed her, looked after her and treated her as if she was their own daughter by giving her what she wanted and taking her to places yet she calls herself a \n\u201clowly dhampir\u201d\n even though she prizes herself by being around royal Moroi? I'm sorry I didn\u2019t realise growing up with Royals was soooo horrible compared to growing up in a blood whore commune(!) *eyeroll* Dimitri is still a dumb bastard, I can only think of two people that can give him personality: Tasha Ozera and hot chocolate. Rose is meant to be a character that stands her ground in any given situation yet everything changes when she is with Dimitri, he slutshames/degrades her for her age yet she just takes it in even saying that he is right. What the fuck? Yet people still call her a good heroine? She fucking isn\u2019t. Period. It becomes more apparent in this book that the only reason that he even likes her is because she is physically strong- notice how \u201csuddenly\u201d he becomes close to her after she killed Strigoi in Frostbite yet neglects her prior to that incident or how he comes all starry-eyed when she tackles him. See? This relationship is just based on physical assets; she calls him \n\u201cbadass\u201d\n and \n\u201cGod\u201d\n (Also Richelle Mead, thank you so fucking much for ruining the word badass for me and also \u2018God\u2019- I was an agnostic and now I am strictly atheist, you twat.) similarly he loves her because she is strong. It makes sense as to why he was also attracted to Tasha- she fought and killed Strigoi who happened to be her sister and her brother-in-law initially showing strength as Moroi aren\u2019t known to be physical fighters.What makes me sick is how the whole romance was based on a forced lust spell (even if there was a hint of an attraction, it was still forced), it\u2019s gross and vile, she was a victim in that incident yet she glorifies the moment like its Christmas or something. Likewise how she is falling prey to Dimitri\u2019s child grooming especially when he is in a position of power because that itself is a form of abuse and I don\u2019t know why the fuck Richelle Mead is making it seem lawful. Oops. Silly me. Dimitri is hot. That excuses him from everything (!)The sex scene was boring, I'm a virgin and I could write better- the quote \n\u201cI didn\u2019t know where my body began and his ended\u201d \nreminded me of  The Human Centipede which made me react like this:\n I hated Dimitri for taking advantage of her when she was at her most vulnerable, for fuck\u2019s sake, if a girl is crying because she is going crazy, you do not just whip your dick out and shag her so she can shut up. Yes, the Montana age of consent is 16 but the Moroi/Dhampir society do not follow their rules as 18 is the rightful age for being an adult according to their own laws.Anyway moving on to much brighter things in the book: Adrian- I loved him in this book and I was delighted to see development of his character that he isn\u2019t just this drunken, bad boy faced but he has a heart of gold. He genuinely seems to care for Rose and although he is of Royal blood- he treats her as an equal. His lines made me have a good laugh and the chemistry between him and Rose has the power to become something amazing and I think that their romance would beat Rose and Dimitri by a fucking mile. How Rose treated him at the end of this book was not right by playing with his feelings to get money for her dumb \u201cfind-Dimitri-&-feel-the-power-of-his-tiny-dick-again-lol\u201d and I honestly believe he deserves so much better than her. So to all you reviewers who are thinking I am a bitter Rose and Adrian fan, I'm not, because Rose and Dimitri deserve each other for being the two dumbest shitheads I have ever read about since Edward and Bella.I loved Lissa and Christian; they seem to be the only couple I care about at this stage because a.) they have a lot of intense lovin\u2019 going on- I was turned on in the first couple of lines, not going to lie and b.) they seem like a healthy balanced relationship whose characteristics compliments each other and actually encourage each other to become a better person. I also loved Christian and Rose\u2019s warm friendship that developed, it was hilarious yet cute seeing those two interact and my favourite part of the whole book was when they both teamed up to fight Strigoi with his power and her stake skills. I also rate Richelle Mead (even though I have problems with her primary romances in her books) for killing off Dimitri and making him into a Strigoi, I was cheering personally, but I loved how intense it was because usually most YA authors would never do that to their love interests, especially to the principal one. I admire her for going there and building momentum in this series because it made the ending a whole lot more powerful.The rest of the characters I liked. Eddie is one of those characters that I just love because he is always there for Rose, Mia has developed a lot and I like that, and I also liked Tatiana because she seemed to ooze power and control and made the plot a lot more interesting. I didn\u2019t like Jill, she just seemed to be there so she can jizz her pants over Rose and Dimitri to show how super ~speshul they are and she had no real value to the plot line.Overall, aside certain things, I really liked this book, the writing has improved and she certainly stepped up in her game which is why this book stands out for me amongst other YA novels."}, {"userName": "Juliana Zapata", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28636277-juliana-zapata", "userReview": "En este libro las emociones no hacen mas que aumentar a cada p\u00e1gina, llegas a un punto en que la acci\u00f3n, la pasi\u00f3n, el romance y el peligroso no te dejan parar de leer.Hasta ahora mi favorito de la saga.

I really like how Ms. Mead takes things to a level where not everything has a happy ending. It has realistic qualities for being a young adult paranormal book. I felt Rose's pain and confusion as she struggled with what she had to deal with being \"shadow kissed\". I enjoyed her interactions with Lissa, Dmitri and Adrian. Even though I inadvertently knew a big piece of the story, it didn't happen as I envisioned. This book has a lot of heart, emotion and I totally agree with what Rose was planning to do at the end.
