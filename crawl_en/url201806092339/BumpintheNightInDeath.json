I figured I was on vacation and can read only my favorite parts if I wanted to! ;) So far so good...Finally made time to finish this one. \"Poppy's Coin\" was very predictable. I found it boring just waiting for it to unfold, as I was pretty sure it would without giving much thought to the characters.\"The Passenger\" was an interesting concept for a story; I enjoyed the characters and would be interested in reading more from the author.\"Mellow Yellow\" was cute and charming... but a little silly, about an imaginary friend. I really enjoyed the author's writing style. It had such a good rhythm, and I liked the characters.

RobbIs the lieutenant-of-the-future hunting a flesh & blood killer or a ghost in this typical Eve Dallas tale?I LOVE Nora Roberts but after reading the first eight or so of the Dallas series I got a bit tired of them, finding, that for me, they were all too much the same & I can't tell them apart anymore! This short story hasn't encouraged me to go back to them. Enjoyable while read but nothing to get excited about.Poppy's Coin - Mary BlayneyDoes Poppy's coin grant wishes? It would appear so in this tale set in the early nineteenth century as told to a young girl visiting present day London. My favourite of the four stories & found it reminded me of Amanda Quick in style.The Passenger - Ruth Ryan LanganIn brief, two strangers (man & woman!) meet on the deserted & mysterious Spirit Lake where paranormal sightings have occurred. An unbelievable tale that I really enjoyed this until the end which had me going ,I>\"Oh, purleeese!!!\".Mellow Lemon Yellow - Mary Kay McComasFrom the first couple of chapters I thought that this story of Charlotte & Mel was going be quirky but amusing & I'd like it but no!

I don't think it did anything to add to the In Death series - neither progression of characters or background to the following books. It was a quick read, and I love the characters from the In Death series, so it wasn't a hardship to read this book. I just didn't feel like to added to the series.

I have read subsequent tales but wanted to know where and how it all got started - and I was not disappointed.Also being an avid follower of the In Death series by J D Robb was a bonus as I had not read the Haunted episode yet. It's always nice catching up with Dallas, Lieutenant Eve and hubby Roarke as well as her trusted sidekick Peabody.However, anthologies like these are also meant to introduce the reader to other, lesser known and/or new authors. Ruth Ryan Langan's The Passenger and Mary Kay McComas' Mellow Lemon Yellow fit right into the subject of Bump in the Night, four all new paranormal stories. And they are all very different, too.Dallas and Peabody encounter a haunted place - one believing it possible, the other vehemently denying it. Poppy's magic coin causes wishes to come true - however, not always in the obvious way, especially if the 'wisher' is not specific enough. Oh, and the coin decides which wish is worth following through on. The third storyline covers the healing of two young people trying to run away from their past by travelling a lot, while Mellow Lemon Yellow covers the adult version of an invisible friend.

I truly enjoyed all the stories. My review of Haunted in Death will be in the actual book. Here is my review of Poppy's Coin: Poppy is a young girl of nine who wished for father and got it in Major David Lindsey. Poppy's gift to Lindsey is the coin that makes wishes come true. Major David Lindsey saves Lady Grace Anderson from having her clothes ruined. There's an instant attraction but Major Lindsey is attempting to take care of two children comes first no matter what he wants. Will Major Lindsey find what he seeks? Can Lady Anderson convince Major Lindsey to help her? Your answers await you in Poppy's Coin. Here's my review of The Passenger:Josh Cramer is an extreme sportsman really looking for some peace and quiet instead of his next adventure. It appears fate has other plans for Josh. Grace Marin is going to try to see if legend of Spirit Lake is true. What Grace didn't expect was a plane crashing near where she was staying. Grace is afraid of relationships because she doesn't know the value of love. But Grace often wonders about her mother and why she left. Will Grace find her answers? How does Josh help with that? Your answers await you in The Passenger. Last review of :This final tale is about a young woman that dresses and doesn't act her own age. Charlotte Gibson is trying to discover herself but she keeps seeing a man that no one else sees. Her journey of self-discovery takes her to places she didn't even know existed outside of her sheltered world. Mel claims that Charlotte knows him very well. Can Mel help Charlotte? Will Charlotte accept Mel's help?

This book was about a guy that was a dare devil and the lady was a reporter. The main idea of the story was to get the two to find love.The mother could not cross over until she let her daughter know she was loved and wanted. The Passenger was a great supernatural book. I like how you could relate to Josh and Grace in this story and how they feel to all the supernatural they experience together. A mothers love is that strong.I dislike that it wasn't a longer story. I would recommend teens and young adults to read this story.I will read this book again.  Mellow Lemon Yellow by Mary Kay McComas was two stars. The main idea of the story is that the girl lived her whole life to please her parents. Then when her dad died her imaginary friends came back to her, and she was a young adult and this time. So her imaginary friend got her to redecorate her and her dad apartment and change her image. After all of that she found love. I liked that she found love. I didn't like the concept of the imaginary friend. It did not keep me interested the way the others did. The ending were she lets her imaginary friend go was the best part of this book. I have read other books by Mary Kay McComas that I loved but I didn't love this story. I would recommend teens to read this book."}, {"userName": "Kathy Martin", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3122948-kathy-martin", "userReview": "Haunted in Death by J. D. Robb - I listened to the audio of this one and reviewed it here. It was an entertaining story that had ultra-rational Eve confronting a ghost. I liked the by-play between Eve and Roarke in this one. The story was well-told and well-read.Poppy's Coin by Mary Blayney -- This is a historical romance centered around a magic coin. A gentleman, short of coin and the guardian to two young children, takes a job as a companion for a rich widow and then has to deal with falling in love with her without feeling like he sold himself to her. It was a nice romance.The Passenger by Ruth Ryan Langan is a contemporary ghost story. The hero and heroine meet in the wilderness where she is trying to get a story of a mysterious light on a lake and he is beginning a daredevil quest of survival. They meet when his plane crashes and she finds him and fall in love - guided by the spirit of her dead mother. It was also entertaining as the two lonely people decided that they had found the perfect person for each of them.Mellow Lemon Yellow by Mary Kay McComas -- I abandoned this one when the male lead (at least I think so) made his first appearance at the heroine's father's funeral wearing ruby red slippers. Apparently the heroine was the only one who could see him. I didn't have the patience to keep reading and figure out what was going on.All in all, the J. D. Robb story was great, the other two stories I read were entertaining, and only one didn't suit my taste."}, {"userName": "Kristin Lundgren", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/913045-kristin-lundgren", "userReview": "This is a short story collection, four of them. I haven't read a romantic collection in years, so it was a flashback for me. The first was part of the Eve Dallas future cop series by JD Robb - hard to get much back story on the characters, and have a mystery, but it was a good read, about an old murder and a new one. A little ghost activity for fun. 2nd one by Mary Blayney was set in Regency England - a basic romantic story with the addition of a \"magic\" coin that granted wishes. Sweet, charming, although a little off century (uses words like sex in conversation which would NOT have been done). 3rd was by Ruth Ryan Langan, about an extreme adventurer and a exotic photographer who are flung together during their respective assignments in the remote Alaskan Wilderness. Plenty of spirits walking, on the water, and in life. Nice romantic tale, with just the right amount of paranormal. Last one was a cute one by Mary Kay McComas, about an imaginary friend who reappears after a young woman's father dies. They had been partners in an accounting business, and she had forgotten how to live her own life, so the friend reappears, wearing clothes she thought were cool back when she was six, and they find a way to get her back on track as her own person. Fun, very unusual, but lacked much detail when the real love came around. That was short changed, although it is a short story. All in all, not a bad apple in the bunch. One great, but all good."}, {"userName": "Cherisse", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7144906-cherisse", "userReview": "***spoiler alert*** 1st time finished ?? skipped #2 and #3? skimmed #4?2nd time 1/21/12 to 1/28/121. \"Haunted in Death\" - J.D.
