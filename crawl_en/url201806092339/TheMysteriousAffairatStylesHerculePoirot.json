The feelings are embarrassing at first; you find the Belgian himself to be quite an embarrassment. But there is just something about him. Could it be his suave, continental sense of humor... his keen sense of justice... his shapely, rubenesque figure? Or is it simply his hypnotic mustache, perhaps? The passion develops in fits and starts. You don\u2019t want to love him, you really don\u2019t. You don\u2019t want to follow him around, adventure after adventure. You don\u2019t want to be his little bitch, always at his beck and call, sniping and moaning at him but loving it nonetheless. You don\u2019t like mysteries but you are about to fall victim to the greatest mystery of them all: the mystery of the human heart! Try as you may, the Belgian has hold of you, heart and soul. You will follow him forever.If you decide that to love somebody, you must set them free... preferably in Iraq, choosehttps://www.goodreads.com/review/show...If you decide to follow the little Belgian to the ends of the earth, choose http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/..."}, {"userName": "j", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2863914-j", "userReview": "\"Dear me, Poirot,\" I said with a sigh, \"I think you have explained everything! And how wonderful of you to wait until page 230 to finally shed light on all your absurd behavior throughout the book, and to justify and the red herrings and narrative padding! But of course, it could only be so in the classic style of a fiendish murder mystery! Why, in fact, though this is but the first case we have solved together, I have no doubt we could do the exact same thing as many as 86 more times, depending on if you count the smaller cases!\"\"Quite so, mon ami,\" Poirot chuckled. \"You make such a reliably dim-witted Watson!\"I looked at Poirot in silent amazement.

Agatha Christie died in 1976, and I was born the following year. Two things come to mind... (1) It's a good thing I wasn't alive when she died because I would have been so miserable to be around. (2) Since I was born just about a year later, I'm wondering if maybe a small part of her lives on... as I love her genius and her works of literature... and I can re-read her books over and over again without ever getting bored.There are tons of reviews of all her major works, and I don't need to be repetitive in my review. What I'd really try to get across is why you need to read ANY of her works, and then why I'd suggest this one:1. This was one of her first books, and I believe the first published one, in 1920, which means she was probably writing it exactly 100 years ago. And though some of the language is a little different, and it takes place with a different cultural atmosphere, the crux of the story -- its plot, is appropriate at any point in time. People don't love Christie for her beautiful language or her great ideas... yeah, she had some of those... but it's her plots and characters that stand out. And those transcend time. 2. Who else can create such a puzzle that you are constantly trying to guess what's going on? True, tons of writers today, but not 100 years ago. And even with modern writers, it's often in a suspense and thriller type of novel, where it's all about the chase. Christie was all about the calm approach to solving a murder. She didn't try to end each chapter with a big WOW and heart-wrenching scare tactic. It's simple evolution of a timeline, collections of clues, conversations with people... and then you start to see the puzzle come together. But at the last minute, you get the unexpected twist.3. With this first book, you meet Hercule Poirot, one of her two popular detectives. Poirot is annoying. He's painful. He will make you angry while you are laughing. And that's the cool part. Columbo is the best comparison I can come up with. And I'm certain Columbo was based on large part by Christie's Poirot.So why this book???????It's the first in the series. It's a prime example of why her stories work. It's the ultimate tale - a family with secrets. It takes place in the UK... the best place to visit and perhaps live. I don't live there, only visited it. :}But it's really the slow build-up of the clues that will have your mind working overtime. So... if you need a Christie stand-alone book, go to \"And Then There Were None.\" If you like female investigators, choose a Miss Marple. If you like a Belgian male detective, flip a coin and pick between Murder on the Orient Express or The Mysterious Affair at Styles. Both will be a great read. But if you need to start at the beginning, go with this one to see what an author's first book looks like. Because if I didn't have my Christie... I'd be like...\n\nAbout Me\n\nFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT.

I can't pinpoint it but there have been too many gray days even without the snow on the ground. Spring is mercifully around the corner and with it sun and happier reading times ahead. I tend to read mysteries as palette cleansers in between denser reads but at count I have read four mysteries this month and perhaps I can squeeze in another. In fact, February should be mystery month. On that note, what better way to spend the lingering winter days with the Queen of Crime, Dame Agatha Christie herself. The Mysterious Affair at Styles is her first case that introduced Hercule Poirot to the world, and, as usual, Dame Christie did not disappoint. Colonel Hastings has been called to Styles Arms at the request of his friend John Cavendish. It is the war years and Hastings is appreciative to take leave of the army. At Styles, Hastings encounters arguments between the various inhabitants of the manor. There is fighting between Mr and Mrs Alfred and Emily Inglethorpe, between Mr Inglethorpe and his cousin Evelyn Howard, between John and Mary Cavendish, and between John and his brother Lawrence. Either the Great War has made the extended Inglethorpe-Cavendish clan tense, or things are not as rosy on the inside of the manor as they appear on the outside. It is in this tense environment that within two nights of Hastings arrival that Mrs Emily Inglethorpe is found dying in her bed. A doctor is summoned and rules Mrs Inglethorpe's death to be murder by strychnine poisoning. Hastings is asked to lead the investigative team but with his narrow mind, he is clueless as to who would want to murder and elderly lady. By chance, a group of Belgians is staying at a cottage close to Styles Arms, and among them is Hastings old friend, the one and only Hercule Poirot. Already highly regarded as a premier detective in his home country, Poirot is summoned by Hastings to assist him in solving this dreadful case. Christie first published The Mysterious Affair at Styles in 1921 and the book has stood the test of time. Poirot mentions that Hastings should use his gray cells, and he seems a step ahead of both Hastings and Scotland Yard Inspector Japp. Inspector Japp almost immediately accuses John Cavendish of murdering his mother and places her on trial, yet Poirot by thoroughly examining each and every clue tells his counterparts to have patience because perhaps a key piece is missing and perhaps the wrong person has been implicated. Yes, John Cavendish can stand to gain in his mother's will from her death but does it make him a murderer. Only Poirot seems to attest to the truth and leads Hastings, the inhabitants of Styles Arms, and Christie's readers on a fact finding mission to unravel the case. As Styles gained in popularity, Christie found that she had a formula that worked with cases starring her famous Belgian detective. As with many of Christie's future cases featuring Poirot, he has all the principal players gather as he explains to them the crime, motive, and guilty party in an easy to follow step by step manner. And as with many cases, Poirot introduces a new piece of evidence toward the end that plays a significant role in the case. Christie's cases are always fun to read even if it is tricky to guess whodunit based on the lack of this key clue. Yet I keep reading her cases and other mysteries to sharpen my mind and keep my little gray cells in order. It is a good thing that February does not last too much longer or I would probably be reading a case featuring the famous Belgian detective before the calendar turns to spring. 4 stars"}, {"userName": "Tina Haigler", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30268418-tina-haigler", "userReview": "Ok. Let's get down to business. This is an old fashioned British mystery novel. So much information! Trying to keep it all straight in my head was extremely difficult. My brain was all over the place but that's what makes a good mystery, in my opinion. This is the first book starring the world famous Hercule Poirot and his friend Hastings. Poirot is an eccentric detective from Belgium who fled to England during WWI. Hastings is a little on the dramatic side, always jumps to the wrong conclusions, and never catches on to the hints that Poirot throws his way. It definitely helps inject some humor into what would normally be very dour subject matter. The first part of this book (other than the murder of course) is a little slow due to character building, so for about the first 100 pages. After that, Scotland Yard gets involved and that's when things start to get a bit more interesting. The investigation heats up. There are six suspects. People start being cleared or becoming suspicious. At this point it could be anyone. Everyone in this book seems a little shady for one reason or another. The servants seem to be the only ones you don't suspect. Also this book has a lot of dialogue. You have the suspects talking to each other, Poirot interviewing people for information, and Poirot explaining clues, and of course when he reveals everything at the end of the book.I might be a little biased because I love David Suchet as Poirot in the TV show but I really enjoyed this book. It kept me guessing and it was intricate and interesting enough to keep my attention. If you enjoy an old fashioned mystery but have never read Agatha Christie before, this one is a good place to start :)"}, {"userName": "Mohammed Arabey", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2017", "userURL":

Poirot. By any standards it is an assured and well written debut novel and, considering the period it was written, it is also remarkably undated. Apparently, Agatha Christie was challenged by her sister to write a detective story, for which I am eternally grateful, as this was her offering. Like one of the characters in this novel, Agatha worked in the dispensary of a local hospital and gained a knowledge of poisons, which she used in her novel. She also saw the arrival of Belgian refugees during WWI, which gave her detective his background. Our narrator, Hastings, writes an account of the \u2018Affair at Styles.\u2019 He has been invalided home from the Front, when he is invited to stay at Styles with an old friend, John Cavendish. John lives at Styles with his wife, Mary, his brother, Laurence, his step-mother, her companion, Evie Howard and his mother\u2019s ward, Cynthia. Recently, there has been another addition to the household too, as his step-mother has remarried the much younger Alfred Inglethorp. Alfred has caused an air of constraint to the household and, when Mrs Inglethorp is murdered, he is the natural suspect.Nearby, M. Poirot has been staying in a house provided by Mrs Inglethorp, along with other Belgian refugees. Hastings knew Poirot well and, when the murder occurs, he asks him to investigate. This book contains many of the characters that Poirot fans will come to know well \u2013 not only Hastings but Detective Inspector James Japp of Scotland Yard. Interestingly, this edition also includes the original, unpublished ending, in which Poirot explains the crime in the courtroom \u2013 before this was re-written at the request of the publisher to take place in the drawing room setting that lovers of Golden Age mysteries are very familiar with. A wonderful beginning to my favourite detective series of all time."}, {"userName": "PattyMacDotComma", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1128612-pattymacdotcomma", "userReview": "4\u2605\u2018What have I always told you? Everything must be taken into account. If the fact will not fit the theory\u2014let the theory go.\u2019 \u2018Well, we shall see,\u2019 I said, nettled.\u201dHercule Poirot, world-renowned Belgian detective extraordinaire, first arrived on the literary scene in 1920, in this, Agatha Christie\u2019s very first book. He seems to have arrived fully formed, with all of his eccentricities and powerful \u201clittle grey\u201d cells ready to go. \u201cHe was hardly more than five feet, four inches, but carried himself with great dignity. His head was exactly the shape of an egg, and he always perched it a little on one side. His moustache was very stiff and military. The neatness of his attire was almost incredible. I believe a speck of dust would have caused him more pain than a bullet wound.\u201dHe is introduced to us by Hastings, a young man returning from the front of WW1 to relax with his old friend John Cavendish at Styles, the Cavendish family estate. John\u2019s mother is the matriarch of the family, whom Hastings remembers from past visits as\u201ca lady who liked to make her own plans, and expected other people to fall in with them, and in this case she certainly had the whip hand, namely: the purse strings.\u201dShe\u2019s now made her own plans to the extent that she remarried a rather strange man, twenty years younger, whom nobody seems to like. A gold-digger, perhaps? There are many other characters, all living or staying at Styles, and a few, like Poirot, from the nearby village. This situation became a Christie trademark \u2013 a closed group of people \u201cIt must be one of us!\u201d living or staying together in a single dwelling (island, train).Someone dies in suspicious circumstances, (of course \u2013 this is Agatha Christie, after all), and Hastings asks if he might invite his old friend Poirot, a retired detective who is currently living in the village with a group of Belgians, to help investigate.Ah, the clues are many, the bits of thread, the grains of this or that, the odd timing of someone\u2019s arrival or departure, the pieces of conversation overheard through closed doors \u2013 the suspicions! Little locked boxes, locked desks, bolted doors \u2013 all part of the mystery.Hastings greatly admires Poirot and knows how clever he is, and is delighted when Poirot compliments him on some observation Hastings offers. But when Poirot seems dismissive of his \u2018insight\u2019, Hastings thinks Poirot should count himself lucky that he has Hastings there to consult with. \u201cI shrugged my shoulders. If he was going to take the matter that way, it was no good arguing with him. The idea crossed my mind, not for the first time, that poor old Poirot was growing old. Privately I thought it lucky that he had associated with him some one of a more receptive type of mind. Poirot was surveying me with quietly twinkling eyes. \u2018You are not pleased with me, mon ami?\u2019 \u2018My dear Poirot,\u2019 I said coldly, \u2018it is not for me to dictate to you. You have a right to your own opinion, just as I have to mine.\u2019 \u2018A most admirable sentiment,\u2019 remarked Poirot, rising briskly to his feet.\u201dFortunately, Poirot's twinkling eyes indicate he doesn\u2019t take offence, and Hastings is generous enough to concede (privately, to us) from time to time, that really, the little fellow is something special and can outwit anyone.A delightful introduction to Christie\u2019s enormous, influential body of work. It is a bit dated, (well, of course), and I didn\u2019t find it quite as compelling as I might have when it was first published. But I certainly enjoyed M. Poirot\u2019s (and Christie\u2019s) debut!You can borrow a copy at the Open Library.

I wish I'd picked one up sooner! I figured my first read should be the first book published (I have an OCDish need to read books in order) and I have to say that this is a fantastic debut novel. Most authors' work gets better with time - if Christie gets better than this then I have some treats in store!Long story cut short:- Mrs Inglethorp, the old lady owner of Styles Court, suffers a violent fit early one morning and dies. It appears that foul play is in the air and the family bring in Hercule Poirot to investigate...This book was everything a murder mystery should be. There were intriguing characters (which, incidentally, are nicely fleshed-out), a page-turning plot, plenty of clues and red-herrings and, best of all, it kept me guessing right until the very end. The narration also works well - by having Hastings as the narrator, we don't get to see inside Poirot's head, so we can continue to form our own conclusions right to the end. I also liked how quaint this was. As a reader of more modern thrillers such as James Patterson, Lee Child and David Baldacci, it was nice to realise that there isn't always a requirement for violence, blood and guts in order to have a good plot.I will definitely be picking up more of Christie's work."}, {"userName": "Araz Goran", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32779601-araz-goran", "userReview": "\u0623\u062c\u0627\u062b\u0627 \u0643\u0631\u064a\u0633\u062a\u064a ~ \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0636\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0627\u0645\u0636\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u0633\u062a\u0627\u064a\u0644\u0632\u0627\u0644\u0638\u0647\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0644 \u0644\u0644\u0634\u064a\u0637\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0628\u0642\u0631\u064a \" \u0628\u0648\u0631\u0627\u0648 \"..\u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u0639\u0642\u062f\u0629\u060c \u0645\u0631\u0647\u0642\u0629\u060c \u0645\u0644\u064a\u0626\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0641\u0627\u062c\u0623\u062a \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0642\u0644\u0628\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u064a\u0628\u0629\u060c \u0641\u064a \u0643\u0644 \u0644\u062d\u0636\u0629 \u064a\u062a\u062c\u0647 \u0639\u0642\u0644\u0643 \u0648\u062a\u0641\u0643\u064a\u0631\u0643 \u0646\u062d\u0648 \u0623\u062d\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0634\u062a\u0628\u0647 \u0628\u0647\u0645 (\u0648\u0647\u0645 \u0643\u064f\u062b\u0631) \u060c \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u062f\u0627\u0639\u064a \u0644\u0644\u062d\u0631\u062c \u0639\u0646\u062f\u0645\u0627 \u062a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0645\u062e\u0637\u0626\u0627\u064b \u0641\u064a \u0643\u0644 \u0645\u0631\u0629.. \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u062d\u0627\u0648\u0644 .. \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0648\u0631\u0637 \u0646\u0641\u0633\u0643 \u0648\u062a\u0628\u062d\u062b \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u062a\u0644 \u0647\u0646\u0627 .. \u062f\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0623\u0644\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u0648\u0642\u062a \u0641\u062d\u0633\u0628\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0647\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u062d\u062f\u0647\u0627 \u064a\u0645\u0643\u0646 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0623\u062a\u064a\u0643 \u0628\u0647\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u062a\u0644 \u0623\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u062a\u0644\u0629 !!\u0639\u0628\u0642\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u062c\u062f\u0627\u064b...."}, {"userName": "Duane", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24389390-duane", "userReview": "This is the first published novel of Agatha Christie, and the first to feature her famous detective character, Hercule Poirot.

Affair at Styles: Meeting Hercule PoirotDame Agatha Christie was born Agatha Mary Clarissa Miller on 15 September 1890 in Torquay, Devon, South West England and lived a very full life until her death by natural causes on 12 January 1976. During those eighty-five years the lady published sixty-six novels and fourteen short story collections, becoming the best selling author in history, outsold only by the Bible.\n\n\n\nAgatha Christie as a child\nChristie's remarkable life as a writer had to begin somewhere. She was homeschooled by her father. Although her mother didn't want her to read before she was eight, young Agatha, bored, taught herself to read by age five. Agatha was the recipient of her Mother Clara's gifted storytelling. Her first writing would be short stories.It was this book, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, published by John Lane of the Bodley Head in London in 1921. Curiously, The Times published it completely as a serial to great reception. Even more curious is that Christie's first book was offered by Lane to be published in the United States in 1920. Both the American and subsequent English editions featured the same dust jacket.< blockquote>\n\nThe Mysterious Affair at Styles, First Edition, The Bodley Head, London, 1921\n Oddly enough, Agatha Christie wrote her first Poirot novel on a bet with her older sister Madge that Agatha could not write a detective novel. But Agatha, who had a taste for mysteries, had cut her teeth on The Woman in White and The Moonstone by Wilkie Collins, and the Sherlock Holmes stories by A. Conan Doyle. Christie took the bet.Agatha had met and married Archie Christie in 1914. Her husband fought in World War One as a fighter pilot. While her husband was overseas, Christie began The Mysterious Affair at Styles in 1916, the year in which the novel is set. Conveniently, Christie volunteered at a hospital where she worked in the dispensary. She learned quite a bit about poisons, how they worked, the symptoms, and the anomalies in which poisons did not always cause the expected reaction.So, Hercule Poirot was born. Her inspiration was a group of Belgian refugees living in her hometown of Torquay.From her Autobiography, Christie wrote:\n\"Then I remembered our Belgian refugees. We had quite a colony of Belgian refugees living in the parish of Tor. Why not make my detective a Belgian? I thought. There were all types of refugees. How about a refugee police officer? A retired police officer. Not too young a one. What a mistake I made there. The result is that my fictional detective must really be well over a hundred now. Anyway, I settled on a Belgian detective.\"\nChristie's debut novel was well received both in England and the United States. Copies sold briskly. Incredibly, Agatha Christie earned only 25 Pounds for her novel, something that would change with her future novels subject to more favorable contracts.The Bodley Head summarized the plot simply on the original dust jacket.\n\"Introducing Hercule Poirot, the brilliant \u2013 and eccentric \u2013 detective who, at a friend's request, steps out of retirement \u2013 and into the shadows of a classic mystery on the outskirts of Essex. The victim is the wealthy mistress of Styles Court, found in her locked bedroom with the name of her late husband on her dying lips. Poirot has a few questions for her fortune-hunting new spouse, her aimless stepsons, her private doctor, and her hired companion. The answers are positively poisonous. Who's responsible, and why, can only be revealed by the master detective himself.\"\nToday the setting in an English Country Manor seems in no way original. But Christie ushered in the Golden Age of Mystery with Poirot's debut.Author Robert Barnard, in appreciation of Christie's work had this to say:\nIn general The Mysterious Affair at Styles is a considerable achievement for a first-off author. The country-house-party murder is a stereotype in the detective-story genre, which Christie makes no great use of. Not her sort of occasion, at least later in life, and perhaps not really her class. The family party is much more in her line, and this is what we have here. This is one of the few Christies anchored in time and space: we are in Essex, during the First World War. The family is kept together under one roof by the exigencies of war and of a matriarch demanding rather than tyrannical \u2013 not one of her later splendid monsters, but a sympathetic and lightly shaded characterisation. If the lifestyle of the family still seems to us lavish, even wasteful, nevertheless we have the half sense that we are witnessing the beginning of the end of the Edwardian summer, that the era of country-house living has entered its final phase. Christie takes advantage of this end-of-an-era feeling in several ways: while she uses the full range of servants and their testimony, a sense of decline, of break-up is evident; feudal attitudes exist, but they crack easily. The marriage of the matriarch with a mysterious nobody is the central out-of-joint event in an intricate web of subtle changes. The family is lightly but effectively characterised, and on the outskirts of the story are the villagers, the small businessmen, and the surrounding farmers \u2013 the nucleus of Mayhem Parva. It is, too, a very clever story, with clues and red herrings falling thick and fast. We are entering the age when plans of the house were an indispensable aid to the aspirant solver of detective stories, and when cleverness was more important than suspense. But here we come to a problem that Agatha Christie has not yet solved, for cleverness over the long length easily becomes exhausting, and too many clues tend to cancel each other out, as far as reader interest is concerned. These were problems which Conan Doyle never satisfactorily overcame, but which Christie would.\"\nChristie won that bet with Sister Madge. Repeatedly."}, {"userName": "Sandy *The world could end while I was reading and I would never notice*", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30817744-sandy-the-world-could-end-while-i-was-reading-and-i-would-never-notice", "userReview": "EXCERPT: We strained and heaved together. The framework of the door was solid, and for a long time it resisted our efforts, but at last we felt it give beneath our weight, and finally, with a resounding crash, it was burst open.We stumbled in together, Lawrence still holding his candle. Mrs. Inglethorp was lying on the bed, her whole form agitated by violent convulsions, in one of which she must have overturned the table beside her. As we entered, however, her limbs relaxed, and she fell back upon the pillows.John strode across the room, and lit the gas. Turning to Annie, one of the housemaids, he sent her downstairs to the dining-room for brandy. Then he went across to his mother whilst I unbolted the door that gave on the corridor.I turned to Lawrence, to suggest that I had better leave them now that there was no further need of my services, but the words were frozen on my lips. Never have I seen such a ghastly look on any man's face. He was white as chalk, the candle he held in his shaking hand was sputtering onto the carpet, and his eyes, petrified with terror, or some such kindred emotion, stared fixedly over my head at a point on the further wall. It was as though he had seen something that turned him to stone. I instinctively followed the direction of his eyes, but I could see nothing unusual. The still feebly flickering ashes in the grate, and the row of prim ornaments on the mantelpiece, were surely harmless enough.THE BLURB: Poirot, a Belgian refugee of the Great War, is settling in England near the home of Emily Inglethorp, who helped him to his new life. His friend Hastings arrives as a guest at her home. When the woman is killed, Poirot uses his detective skills to solve the mystery.MY THOUGHTS: Agatha Christie\u2019s first novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, was the result of a dare from her sister Madge who challenged her to write a story. Thank you Madge! But for this sisterly dare, we may never have been able to read the delightful detective stories Miss Christie is so famous for. And although The Mysterious Affair at Styles was her first novel, I think it remains of the best. All through listening, I was changing my mind as to the identity of the murderer. And, in the end, I was still wrong!I listened to the audio version of The Mysterious Affair at Styles by Agatha Christie, narrated by Hugh Fraser, via OverDrive.

The story does, however, introduce three well-known Christie characters: Hercule Poirot, Captain Hastings, and Inspector Japp. As the book opens Hastings has been injured in WWI and is recuperating at Styles Court, a manor house in the country. Styles Court belongs to the Cavendish family, and is currently occupied by a diverse assemblage of people, including: Emily Inglethorpe - the widow of the late Mr. Cavendish - who inherited a lifetime interest in the house AND a large sum of money; Emily's new - much younger - husband, Alfred Inglethorpe; Emily's adult stepson, John Cavendish; John's wife Mary; John's bachelor brother Lawrence; Evelyn Howard - Emily's longtime friend and companion; Cynthia Murdoch - the orphaned daughter of family friends; and Dorcas, the maid. There's a tense atmosphere at Styles because of simmering resentments and secrets. For example:John Cavendish - who'll inherit the manor house when his stepmother dies - thinks it should have been his all along; in addition, John is suspected of dallying with the pretty wife of a neighboring farmer. John's wife Mary, in turn, spends a lot of time with Dr. Bauerstein - the local toxicologist who hails from Germany. To add to this 'quadrangle', Captain Hastings has a crush on beautiful Mary.Evelyn Howard hates Alfred Inglethorpe, convinced he only married Emily for her money.Alfred Inglethorpe's thick beard looks like a disguise, and he has long poorly explained absences.Lawrence Cavendish resents Cynthia Murdoch, who's very aware of her status as an 'outsider'; Cynthia supports herself with a job in a pharmacy.....and she seems to be the only one of this bunch who's actually employed. As it happens, a group of Belgian refugees, including Hercule Poirot, are living in a house near Styles Court - an arrangement facilitated by Emily Inglethorpe. Hastings is thrilled to see Poirot and lauds the former policeman's detective skills - so it's clear they've met before. In the midst of the testy atmosphere at Styles Court Emily Inglethorpe dies from strychnine poisoning - in a locked room. Hastings suspects foul play and prevails on Poirot to investigate, and the Belgian complies.....with Hastings as his partner. To round out the 'detective trio', Inspector Japp is assigned to the case. During the investigation Poirot learns that Emily had a loud fight with an unknown male on the day before she died; Emily's latest will is missing; there have been shenanigans with Emily's locked document box; someone bought strychnine at the town's pharmacy; coffee and cocoa were consumed on the evening of the murder....and a cup has been smashed; there's something suspicious about Emily's medicine packets; etc. As often happens in these stories, Poirot makes shrewd deductions about everything.....but doesn't share them; Hastings tries to demonstrate his investigative skills but misinterprets most of the clues; and Japp hares off after the wrong suspect(s). The book is chock full of misdirection and red herrings, but - in the end - Poirot gathers the suspects and reveals the truth.The book is just so-so. Though Christie's nascent writing skills are apparent, the plot is overly convoluted (to the point of unbelievability); Poirot talks too much (yak yak yak); and there's a whiff of anti-Semitism and classism (though this is common in Christie's books......a sign of her times.)If you're a long time Agatha Christie fan, this book would make a fun re-read; and if you're new to the famous author's works, this is a good place to start.

Having never read her before, I thought of starting her with the Poirot series which includes her famous detective, Hercule Poirot. The story is a cleverly written murder mystery with interesting twists and turns so as to not give out who the culprit is. The characters were all nice and likable. The eccentric Poirot (it seems detectives are rather eccentric people; Sherlock Holmes comes to my mind!) and his friend and narrator, Mr. Hastings provided the contrasting points of view on the case keeping the reader in curious wonder as to the turn of the events.Overall, it was a very interesting first read. I'm very glad to have finally started up with Agatha Christie, though a little late in my reading life. I certainly have missed on a great murder mystery author."}, {"userName": "Dannii Elle", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44487975-dannii-elle", "userReview": "This is the first installment in the Hecule Poirot series and was just as brilliant as every other detective book I have read by the undoubted Queen of crime fiction!The novel is set in an English manor house, Styles, owned by the the Cavendish family. Hastings, our protagonist, is staying with the family in their regal abode when the unexpected and inexplicable murder of Emily Cavendish (or the more recently referred to, Emily Inglethorpe) occurs. The murder scene, a locked bedroom, baffles detectives and family alike, and it is up to the famous Belgian detective to solve this unsolvable puzzle.I already knew a death would occur before I even turned the first page, as this is a Christie novel, but that didn't dampen the thrilling atmosphere. The emphasis placed on Mrs Cavendish/Inglethorp's \"as yet untasted coffee\" early in the novel also led me to a premature conclusion concerning the victim and the means of her demise. Even this didn't hamper my enjoyment, but added to it: I adore playing the amateur sleuth and seeing if my predictions come true. And that is where Christie's brilliance lies. She involves the reader in the crime and places them in Poirot's role, in the hope of uncovering the clues that will lead to the answer of 'whoddunit?'.I love Christie for giving us an almost voyeuristic insight into the historical upper-class. I also love that the characters continually dismiss Poirot. I have also experienced this in the Miss Marple series. Both are deemed 'past it' when they don't jump to the same, obvious conclusion as the other characters, yet the reader knows who will ultimately be proven correct. As always, Christie takes the reader in a series of previously unsuspected direction before all is revealed and solved just before the close of the novel. This, as with all her other works, left me completely baffled throughout as to who the perpetrator of the crime was. I am no Poirot, but I enjoy attempting to assume his role in these thrilling insights into historical England."}, {"userName": "Erin \u2615 *Proud Book Hoarder*", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3048260-erin-proud-book-hoarder", "userReview": "I have a goal to read all of Poirot's stuff - order isn't terribly important for this type of 'series', but I don't want to touch his final act and book, Curtain, until I've read the others. Just an OCD reader thing.The mystery itself was baffling (closed room rocks), but I didn't care much until the surprising end about the culprit. It's hard to explain why, but maybe because the characters didn't draw me in much, besides the main detective Poirot and the semi-clueless Hastings. The book was completely enjoyable, though, as Poirot shines when he's introduced in this first book featuring the Belgian detective. He doesn't focus on his mustache quite as much yet, alludes to the little grey cells only once, but steals the scenes wherever he goes. Hastings is amusing - I admit some of his books I found dry but I'll have to revisit - but here he's likable as the narrator. I don't get his thing for the women, though, were all men so easily led into marriage back then?Even if I felt little for the victim or cared about the accused cast, I didn't figure out the ending and liked the neat curveball Christie threw the readers way, something I never saw coming. The clues add up but, like Hastings, I'm too dense to get them. It's amazing how Agatha could conceive and hold all that in her mind, but then there is a reason she still stands as one of the very best in detective fiction.Overall a great book featuring Poirot. It's a fast, smooth read with stylish dialogue, a few twists thrown in every few chapters to keep the waters from feeling too calm and keeping the readers mind working. I wasn't entranced by the players, though, so this is not a five-star rating.

Maybe it seems odd to use such a cheery word to describe a murder mystery, but, let's face it, Christie's books are like dinner theater. The actor who plays the victim will pop out from behind the curtain very much alive when all is said and done.Mrs. Inglethorp raised her two stepsons as her own, but there are tensions between them when she inherits the family home, Styles, and her late husband's fortune over the boys. Now that she has remarried, the sons worry that they might be overlooked again in favor of her scoundrel of a new husband. Yes, it seems Mrs. Inglethorp is surrounded by fortune hunters, and there's no shortage of suspects when she is poisoned in the middle of the night. But while she might not be beloved by her family, Mrs. Inglethorp gained a reputation for her generosity to the Belgian people during WW1. And one specific Belgian, Hercule Poirot, is determined to get to the bottom of her murder.I very much enjoyed Poirot's friend Hastings as the narrator, particularly because made himself an unsuspecting idiot the whole book. Hastings is weirdly jealous and a bit of a creeper over his friend's wife, so he deserves it. I didn't see the murderer coming, and the reveal was a nice surprise. And while there's the pinch of racism, smidgen of anti-semitism, and heaping tablespoon of anti-sexism you'd expect from a novel written in 1920, sometimes I get the impression Christie is mocking in her usage.

It certainly was the book that started it all for Hercule Poirot and his friend Hastings. I have never read much of Christie's work, and chose this title for my Literary Birthday challenge for that very reason. I have seen episodes of both Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple on television in the past so it was very easy to picture our famous detective and his partner while I was reading. Seeing these shows also prepared me for the relationship between Hastings and Poirot as well as the typical 'gather all the suspects into one room and confront them with the truth' style of revealing the solution.The story itself was interesting for me to a point. I don't read too many mysteries and I honestly could not get caught up in any of the characters other than Poirot himself. I made the usual guesses about 'whodunnit'; changed my mind several times, and never did choose the correct culprit. But the explanations at the end were clear and made sense, so I was satisfied.A few things did capture my attention:1. Hastings at one point describes an attorney's appearance and says he had a lawyer's mouth....now what exactly would that be?2. We know Poirot is a tidy man, a fussy dresser very careful of his appearance, that's fine and dandy. But there were two scenes that seemed a little odd and I wonder if in future books Christie ever explains the detective's concern about spent matches. He picks up one that John tosses into the shrubbery, then later he puts some used matches in a china pot in his room. What does he plan to do with them? Why does he care about those used matches? Why do I care that he cared?And here are some nifty examples of Hercule Poirot's mind at work:Scolding Hastings: \"You gave too much rein to your imagination. Imagination is a good servant, and a bad master. The simplest explanation is always the most likely.\"Another scolding for Hastings (he certainly never seemed too bright compared to Poirot): \"What have I always told you? Everything must be taken into account. If the fact will not fit the theory\u2014let the theory go.\"And finally, Poirot simply thinking:\"Instinct is a marvellous thing,\" mused Poirot. \"It can neither be explained nor ignored.\"I do not really see myself rushing off to read more Christie after this, but it was fun to meet Poirot on the written page at last and not just on the small screen."}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2337007-brenda", "userReview": "When Hastings was visiting friends at Styles Court in Essex he had no idea what was about to happen.
