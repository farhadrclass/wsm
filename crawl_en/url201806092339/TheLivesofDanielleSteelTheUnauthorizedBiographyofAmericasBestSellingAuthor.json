Danielle Steel.\u201d\nAnd after reading this book, they certainly weren\u2019t kidding.Before the age of Goodreads, before we had the ability to follow authors on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr and whatever else those crazy kids use these days, the only communication with them was through various methods of snail mail (interviews, etc). Unfortunately for those hungry for more information about their favorite writers, you often didn\u2019t get the full picture about what they were really like. So as far as this book goes, this is about as good as it was going to get. So who really is Danielle Steel, this absolute machine of an author who basically has a permanent place on top of the New York Times bestseller list and has the magical unicorn ability to publish as many as three books in the same year?\nWell, to answer your question, she\u2019s one very complicated character, and yet I\u2019m not really sure we\u2019ll ever know who she is. From what I read, she has the uncanny ability to weave fiction into her reality, or gloss over the things that were serious and make them seem trivial. It's no wonder that many of her earlier works were inspired by her childhood and early adult life experiences. She also seems like someone who, in her earlier years, didn\u2019t seem to be able to do anything for herself. The book talks about how she employed a baby nurse and a housekeeper, and when she wanted a pack of cigarettes, she\u2019s just call the drugstore and expect them to deliver the cigs to her house. She\u2019s the woman who self-admittedly owns \u201ca least\u201d 6000 pairs of Louboutin shoes.I mean, really? She\u2019s part socialite, part down to earth person, part diva, part devoted mother, part absent mother\u2026 I could go on and on, but simply put I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever know who the REAL Danielle Steel is. Not to mention her horrible luck with men. Oh my word, her romantic history makes Henry VIII look like a wonderful husband. As far as the book was concerned, it was OK. I would\u2019ve liked a bit more juice to it, and not as much information about her ex-husbands and the legal proceedings that came along with it. I just don\u2019t find that interesting."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4427991-mary", "userReview": "ressed to the nines and draped in jewels, Danielle Steel has become America's favorite romance author. She has written 44 best-selling novels and has a total of 800 million books still in print. This stunning, uncensored biography reveals how closely Danielle Steel's fiction mirrors her real life. The rich men, the dangerous men, the heartbreak, the struggles, the triumphs and the secrets too dark to tell. Her cruel and lonely childhood which became the basis for her novel Loving, her long-hidden marriage to a convicted rapist, the scandalous true story readers will recognize from her novel Now and Forever, her third husband, a handsome heroin addict, who, like the protagonist in Remembrance, broke her heart and nearly ruined her life. From her opulent lifestyle to her lavish spending in a beautiful San Francisco mansion to the tragic death of her 19-year-old son, Nick, Danielle Steel has lived a life that most people might consider somewhat excessive, but is entirely true.I truly enjoyed this book as I like many unauthorized biographies or autobiographies. I have always considered Danielle Steel to be a great writer and think of her as my \"guilty pleasure\" author. I had never thought that the majority of Danielle Steel's plots for her novels were based on events that happened to her in her own life. Since this book was written, Danielle Steel has been married and divorced twice more (her fifth marriage ended in 2002). I felt incredibly sad for Danielle Steel and everything that she's been through - she has loved deeply and sometimes rashly, but in my opinion, there was absolutely nothing that she couldn't or wouldn't do to help the people that she loved. I give this book an A+!"}, {"userName": "Ria", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/921981-ria", "userReview": "A fascinating yet unauthorised account of the scandalous life of Danielle Steel.I learned so much I didn't know about her home life, her family, her love life and marriages, her miscarriages, her personal and writing habits, her obsession with shopping, the distressing court case over her son Nick and her fight to end parental rights for his father.All the nitty gritty is put in this book that might not otherwise have come to light such as her relationships with a drug addict and also another man who turned out to be a rapist which she has subsequently tried to erase all trace of in line with her untarnished public image as a best selling author, mother and wife.Shocking, brutal, graphic and seemingly very honest information that is taken from personal interviews with the people involved, former employees, court evidence etc this makes for great reading as her life reflects situations detailed in her books.Overall this book has changed the way I view her as a person though, she is not so \"goody goody\" and whiter than white as she appears and she has tried to hide a lot of what she considers her shameful past and in parts from what I read I don't think to be honest she is a very likeable person overall.Thats just my personal observation and I am going on the subject matter contained within the book.An absolutely enthralling read for her fans to get the bigger picture."}, {"userName": "Grizel", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5232302-grizel", "userReview": "Highly informative biography on an author whose success I envy. Only four stars, though, because Bane seemed determined to make Steel the villain in her dispute with her hopelessly drug-addicted, small-time criminal ex-husband (number three, I think it was) and I really think she was reaching."}, {"userName": "Julie Barrett", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3023796-julie-barrett", "userReview": "The lives of Danielle Steel, the unauthorized biography of America's by Bane_ Vickie L - Benet_ Lorenzo THave enjoyed many of the author's works and it's going to be interesting to read about custody battles, divorces and life for her.Some of her earlier recollections of life are in her books. Can't imagine the life she's led but you can see where she gets the story lines for some of her books-from her own life.So extravagant with her gifts.

I think because it had the word \"fuck\" in it. As a teacher I thought I should read what the students are sneaking. Surprisingly, it was interesting and inspiring. Allegedly, Danielle Steel would sit and write for 22 hours straight some days. On the other hand, her writing is not \"literary\" and Bane and Benet's writing is tabloid at best."}, {"userName": "Amy Herget losonsky", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10748759-amy-herget-losonsky", "userReview": "Never cared for Bane at all!
