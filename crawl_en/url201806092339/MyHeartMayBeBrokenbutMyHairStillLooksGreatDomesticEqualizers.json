I really like this humorous romance with a touch of mystery. Although the recurring characters are Ed(wina) and Debbie Sue of Domestic Equalizers, this story revolves around Paige, a rich daddy's girl who gets a job as a horse handler at a West Texas ranch. She meets Spur, a former Aggie football star and a new vet for the area. He's barely scraping by in his new practice. The sparks fly between them and even though you know how it will end, it's fun getting there.Quotes to remember:Don't run over him, just get over him.Some things never change...You can put a pair of boots in the oven, but that don't make 'em biscuits."}, {"userName": "Jane", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1002723-jane", "userReview": "Fun, frivolous and feisty, Southern chick lit always focuses on scrappy women refusing to sit back and take s**t, getting on with their lives even when -- yes -- their hearts are breaking.

Yeah, I know, I've been starting quite a few of latest blog reviews with this, but this book totally deserves the OMG, I swear! This was the perfect listen, snort laugh funny, excellent characters I could easily dig, and a good mystery with no murder. Missing horses was the main investigation along with the cheating husbands that are par for the two Domestic Investigators. Main story was Paige McBride and her getting over herself to become a charming young woman...she had a trek to get there. She was born rich and had everything she ever wanted. When she is almost 25, her daddy turns her loose from the funds to make her grow up. Bless her heart, she does her best to find a job, but she's not qualified to do much. She does find a job working on a horse farm in Salt Lick and meets the local veterinarian and does not make a good first impression. Debbie Sue and Edwina do their darndest to help move things along. And each meeting is so funny and sweet. Debbie Sue and Ed take Paige under their margarita-fueled wings and let her know they are there for her in friendship. Spur Atwater is the new veterinarian in town. Now, typically, I would toss the book aside with the main man character having a name like Spur, but it's explained (the kids in the family are named for whichever town their family is living at the time) and I already love Dixie Cash's books, so I got over the name. I also loved the narrator, Peggity Price. She did a wonderful job of voicing all of the characters, nothing too over the top Texan. I just bumped up the next in the series, I GAVE YOU MY HEART, BUT YOU SOLD IT ONLINE, to the top of my RecordedBooks wishlist. I think I am going to have to get these for my keeper shelf to listen to at anytime I need a *snort laugh* lift. I strongly suggest you get one of this series for a good mystery, good laugh and some good romance. Five Texas big ol' sparkly diamonds!!!!"}, {"userName": "Rachel Sides", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3361228-rachel-sides", "userReview": "Dixie Cash is worth reading just for the one-liners.

Paige seemed like a snooty bitch at the beginning of the novel. By then end, she had \"found herself\" and was a really good person. Edwina & Debbie Sue are hair sylists in Salt Lick, Texas, a small town in west Texas. They also own a detective agency called Domestic Equalizers. They've promised their husbands that they would not engage in any violence or real trouble so their main business is taking photos of errant husbands.Paige is a wealthy girl living off her father's wealth. The jet set life was her lifestyle. He's the richest man in Texas. Finally, he said \"no more.\" She had to find a job. With a little help from her father, she got a job as an assistant to a horse trainer on a ranch near Salt Lick. She rents out Debbie Sue's old house and meets the most gorgeous man ever - he's the town new single vet.Suddenly, old horses are disappearing. Could they be sold to a slaughterhouse? Who would do such a thing? All these characters come together to solve the mystery.This horse thiefing is really the secondary plot as the main plot is the romance between Paige & Spur, the new vet in town.

Their answering message for the detective agency is: \u201cDomestic Equalizers: Get the Lowdown before the Showdown\u201d. These books are extremely cozy and romantic but they are so funny that I laugh hysterically at some of the antics. In this one, a new woman Page McBride comes to town. She is a spoiled rich girl who wants to change her life. She goes to work on the biggest ranch in western Texas. Also, there is the handsome new young veterinarian. Of course the romance is between those two.

Especially after Atonement; this is what I needed. No thought involved. Nada. While I enjoyed the story, it didn't really fall true to the back cover. It seemed to me to promise horse thefts and more about the Domestic Equalizers, but the story was narrated by the two love interests with maybe three two-page chapters from the horse thief's perspective. And, never from Debbie Sue or Edwina's that I recall. Which in the end I probably enjoyed more. I also wasn't a big fan of the ending, but I guess how else were they going to wrap it up. All that being said, the one thing that annoyed me the most about this book was the constant referral to the male love interest's penis as his \"Roommate.\" Do people really talk like that? If you do, you should STOP. Seriously.Would I read Dixie Cash again, and another Domestic Equalizer book? Sure. I wouldn't pay $14+ for it though.

The two stylists/detectives sound like a hoot, and I'd actually like to find women like that to hang around! Is this a book that will change the world. Nope!

And theywon't stop until female domestic justice is served.\nDebbie Sue Overstreet and Edwina Perkins-Martin have never encountered a problem that couldn't be fixed with a strong margarita, a whole lot of hairspray, and an ear for gossip.

Her oil-rich daddy has cut her off without a penny and now it's time for her to get one of those real jobs.The Domestic Equalizers know that Paige and her Barbie-doll looks are gonna stir things up. Soon every cowboy, trucker, and even one of Debbie Sue's ex-boyfriends, a rodeo star, is knocking on Paige's door. And, at just about the time she turns up to start her job tending the best cutting horses in Texas, the horses start disappearing from all the local ranches.Paige discovers she actually likes her work. After all, horses are more loyal than most men. But she doesn't like Spur, the new town veterinarian. Besides being movie-star good-looking, Spur's an ex\u2013football star. Women of all ages love the new vet, and suddenly, more cats and dogs are getting sick than ever before.Working on the ranch means Paige can't avoid the man, and all those disappearing horses bring her together with the Domestic Equalizers. Edwina and Debbie Sue think that Spur and Paige make the cutest couple\u2014whether they're too bull-headed to realize it or not. But finding themselves knee-deep in the muck of a horse-thievin' and husband-cheatin' escapade is a whole other issue.
