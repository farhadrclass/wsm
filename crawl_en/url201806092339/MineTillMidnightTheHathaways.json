Well I had my doubts, but if the first book, the wonderful Mine Till Midnight, is any indication of how this series will play out, my answer is a resounding Yes!This book just flew by for me--I never once wanted to put it down! I loved the Hathaway family, with all their eccentricities, although (other than young Beatrix with her love for critters and her 'sticky fingers', and of course eldest sibling Leo with his boozing and carousing and I-don't-give-a-damn attitude) they seemed like a typical family to me. There's the broken hearted 28-year-old Leo, the early 20-ish frail young beauty Win, the 20-something young Gypsy named Merripen who has lived with the Hathaways as sort of a pseudo-brother for the past 15 years, the two teenage sisters, Poppy and Beatrix, and the one holding the whole family together, the ultra-responsible and protective 26 year-old beautiful spinster Amelia. The nearly poor Hathaways have recently lost their parents, and Amelia has sold the family home in London. Leo Hathaway has just inherited the family viscountcy, complete with crumbling estate in Hampshire, and he is now Lord Ramsay. But the new title doesn't bring much money--the estate is small and in disrepair, there's few tenants to bring in any income, and the title is thought to be 'cursed'. But Amelia (who herself is recovering from a broken heart brought on by a betraying fiancee) feels that the family needs a fresh start away from the sad memories of London, so off to Hampshire they go. But first Amelia and Merripen have to track down the wayward Leo, who they feel may be at the gambling house known as Jenner's. And that's where Amelia meets her future in the darkly mysterious, half-gypsy Cam Rohan.We first met Cam, who works at Jenner's, in (I think) Evie's book ( Devil in Winter). Cam is part Irish, part Romany, but had lived the first 10 years of his life with his gypsy family. But then a relative dumped him in London as a 10-year old, and eventually (the late) Ivo Jenner employed him at his club and treated him as a son. Cam, with his keen mind, rose through the ranks at Jenner's, and now he's working as the right-hand-man to the club's new owner, Sebastian St. Vincent. Cam has a knack for making money, and has more than he can ever spend. And even though society looks down on him for his gypsy heritage, he's a huge financial success, has the respect of a few influential friends, and doesn't lack for the company of women. But Cam is restless and is thinking about returning to his gypsy roots. He's tired on living within society's restrictions, and longs for the open air and the freedom to do as he pleases. But then he meets Amelia Hathaway, and she throws a curveball into all his plans, and what he thinks he wants for his future.Let me say I adored the character of Cam Rohan! What a sexy, sweet man! Loved his interesting, colorful back story (although I'm sure there's more to come), loved his struggle for his feelings for the sometimes too independent, responsible Amelia, loved his acceptance that he and Amelia were 'fated' to be together. I loved how he snuck that ring on Amelia's finger after their 'first time'! I loved how he got Amelia to loosen up and think about her own happiness for a change, and how he got her to accept him as a shoulder to lean on. This girl took on way too much responsibility within her own family. I also loved that he wasn't deterred by what society would think of his pairing with Amelia. As long as Amelia would accept him, that was all that mattered to him. He didn't spend much time thinking the typical \"I'm-not-good-enough-for-her\" thing, which I appreciated. Loved the dialogue he and Amelia had--and some of the things Cam said to her, were sweetly poetic and down right erotic! \"I want to open you like a book and read every page. Footnotes included\" and \"I want you. I want to lie with you beneath constellations and clouds and shade trees.\"and \"I can't promise you a perfect life. But I can promise that no matter what happens, I'll give you everything I have. We'll be together. You inside me...me inside you.\" Now who could resist that?Well Amelia's resistance to Cam irritated me a time or two. My God this guy was everthing she could hope for! Who cares if she never wanted to get married! They matched up intellectually, physically (red-hot sexual chemistry), the man was kind, sincere, rich, drop-dead-gorgeous, and responsible. So what was holding her back? She though that Cam, with his gypsy heritage and what he had told her of his plans (this was before he realized he loved her), would not be content in a traditional marriage. She feared he would get restless and eventually leave her. Didn't she believe him when he said he'd found his \"stopping place'? She was wary of getting her heart broken again, so she had trouble trusting Cam's words. I guess that was to be expected, but boy I wanted to shake her sometimes! There was a time where I thought she was just using him for sex, and I didn't like that about her. I was sad for Cam and I thought he deserved better. But thankfully Cam didn't give up and Amelia eventually listened to her heart, and put her fears behind her. Whew...The rest of the book set up the future stories in this series quite well. I'm dying to know more about Merripen, and his possible connection to Cam (they have the same winged horse tattoo). I'm dying to know if Leo will get his act together before it's too late. I'm curious to see if Win will ever regain her health enough to see all her dreams for the future come true. Poppy seems like a level-headed girl (so far), and I'm interested to see how she fares in her first \"season\". Beatrix? I had a hard time believing she was 15--her antics (and the way her family treated her) made it seem like she was way younger. She seems like she's the strangest one in the whole Hathaway family, so I'm sure her story will be unique!One more thing I almost forgot to mention--I was thrilled to see that Lillian and Westcliff (It Happened One Autumn) were the Hathaway's Hampshire neighbors--loved the scenes involving them and I loved when St. Vincent and Evie came to visit too. I love how LK incorporated her Wallflowers characters into this Hathaway series! It makes the transition that much smoother.So, my expectations weren't too high for this book, but I turned out to be very pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I liked it so much, that I'm going to scuttle my plans for my next read, and just move on to Win and Merripen's story (Seduce Me at Sunrise) next.

BOOK.How in the world did it take me so long to start this one? Lisa Kleypas is the real queen of historical romance. Just when I thought I couldn\u2019t love her books more, she proved me wrong. Mine Till Midnight is exceptionally wonderful! This book has everything I want in my HR read.A solid plot and interesting story.A determined and persistent alpha hero with a protective nature and possessive streak.A heroine who is strong and intelligent, but still very traditionally feminine.Perfectly smooth pacing and flow.Beautiful and touching romance.No pushing away. (This is very important for me.)A sweet happy ending.In this book we meet Amelia Hathaway and Cam Rohan.Amelia had stepped up and taken charge of her family since her older brother, Leo, lost his fianc\u00e9e to scarlet fever and he had become incapable of taking care of himself. At the age of twenty-six, she considered herself a spinster. And because of her responsibility to her family, she\u2019d never expected to marry anyone. But then came Cam, an unusual man, a mysterious Rom who would change her life forever.\n\"You're not like any man I've ever known,\" she said. \"You're not even someone I could have dreamed. You're like someone from a fairy story written in a language I don't even know.\" \"The prince, I hope.\" \"No, you're the dragon, a beautiful wicked dragon.\" Her voice turned wistful. \"How could anyone have a normal everyday life with you?\"\nCam is every woman\u2019s dream. For the fact that he\u2019s half-Romany Gypsy half-Irish, makes him even more attractive, unpredictable, and dangerous. When he realized that he wanted to spend his entire life with Amelia, he held nothing back. There was no hesitation. No giving up. And when she had no one to turn to, he was there for her, to be a shoulder she could cry on. He proved himself to be a man she could rely on. Oh, I loved this man!\n\"I can't promise you a perfect life. But I can promise that no matter what happens, I'll give you everything I have. We'll be together. You inside me ... me inside you.\"\nWhat I loved the most about this book was that not only the romantic part took a front seat in this story, but also the part where the Hathaway siblings helped, loved, took care, and protected each other. I felt truly impressed and satisfied with it.This was such a leisurely read. I enjoyed every page I turned and loved every single line I read. Mine Till Midnight hands down one of my favorite HR stories of all time! If I could, I would give this book more than five stars.Thoroughly loved it!"}, {"userName": " Danielle The Book Huntress (Back to the Books)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1570669-danielle-the-book-huntress-back-to-the-books", "userReview": "I hadn't read any Kleypas for a while when I started reading this book. It reminded me of how effective and seductive Kleypas is as a writer. She really does write a beautiful love story. Her stories are dreamy and elegant, full of imagery that draws me into the story and out of my everyday existence. She really is a wordsmith to this reader.I know a lot of fans were unhappy that Cam was not paired with Daisy, but I have no regrets. Cam and Amelia were meant to be together. Cam was searching for something that gave him a sense of home. He found it in Amelia. He found himself unsettled by living as a gadjo (non-Romany). He was almost disgusted with his adopted materialistic lifestyle, hating the fact that he couldn't seem to stop accumulating wealth, even though he tried very hard to lose money, investing in companies sure to fail, but always recieving windfall after windfall. Just when he is about to walk away from that life and return to the wandering ways of the Roma, he meets Amelia. She challenges and compels him as no other woman has. He wants her desperately, although she is clearly a woman who would need a settled man in her life. Yet, he cannot walk away from her. You realize it before Cam does that he is a goner. He tells himself he will walk away from Amelia, but you know that he's not going anywhere. For all his prior determination to leave Amelia alone, once he decides he wants to keep her, Cam is pretty much set on that path. I liked that about this story, as I love heroes in pursuit. I liked that although Cam does seduce Amelia, he has committed to her in his heart and won't go back on that commitment. I really enjoyed the part when Amelia woke up with his ring on his finger, and how she couldn't get it off. I thought that was a nice touch. It was interesting that Amelia was the reluctant one in this story, although it totally made sense. She had been let down by those who loved her. Her parents died on her, leaving her with three younger sisters to care for, and a brother who was intent on losing all of their income, and destroying himself after the loss of his fiancee. Not to mention the fact that her first love abandoned her for a girl whose father could help his career. She is determined not to marry, and feels content with watching over her family. She doesn't think she's anything special. So when Cam starts to pursue her so ardently, she does resist, at least at first. But Amelia is as drawn to Cam as he is to her. He is beautiful and wild, and temptation in an irresistible package. Knowing it's a bad idea to get involved with him, she cannot seem to avoid him or her feelings for him. It was a delicious love story to read.  Amelia's somewhat bad-tempered moments are refreshing. I like sweet heroines a lot more than some readers, but it's also nice to see heroines who do have bad days and temperamental moments. Who do get frustrated and say things in anger. Amelia has a lot of responsibility and stress, and it was realistic for her to have moments where she showed that her nerves were frayed. Cam seemed to embrace her outspoken and at times somewhat abrasive behavior, enjoying that part of her equally with other aspects of her person. He was considerate to her needs, understanding her fears and doubts, and did everything he could to help her family, even before he had committed to marrying her.  Cam truly showed that was steadfast, showing her that he could be relied upon. Considering the fact that Cam is half-Roma, and there was obviously a prejudice against the Roma, I enjoyed the fact that he showed the good traits that her prejudiced ex-fiance Christopher lacked, although he mocked and looked down on the \"dirty, untrustworthy Roma.\" Despite the fact that Cam was Roma and that there were those who did not like the Roma was touched upon, but it wasn't truly an obstacle in their relationship. Cam looked at his heritage as being part of him, and knew he would not give her up, despite the prejudice they might face. I liked that he embraced his heritage, good and bad. As a fan of possessive heroes, I quite enjoyed him being so jealous of any man being near Amelia. The part where he finds out Amelia was alone with Christopher Frost, whew! (Okay I know I'm weird.) The elements of Romany heritage, culture, and language were very interesting to me. I don't really know much about them, so it was a nice little lesson to this history buff. I do have to say that Leo was bugging me. I feel bad that he lost his true love, but he didn't seem to realize that he wasn't just hurting himself, but his sisters who depended on him. I hope that we get to see him mature and get over his loss and become the person he was meant to be. I'm pretty sure that's what Laura (his lost love) would want for him. I loved the paranormal twist with the ghostly haunting that the Hathaways were experiencing, which was heavily tied into Leo's emotional issues. Very nicely done, adding to the delightful Victorian feel. As a fan of classic ghost stories, particularly set in the late 19th/early 20th century, I certainly enjoyed this twist in the story.The Hathaways are an entertaining family, each sister having a distinct personality that I hope to see more of. There were moments that their sisterly interactions reminded me of one of my favorite books, Little Women. You can guess who Win reminded me a little of.I loved the dynamic between Win and Merripen. I have a feeling their book will be wonderful, as it is very clear already how deep the love they have for each other is. Also it was so cool to see St. Vincent (sigh) and Evie, and Westcliff and Lillian. I like how down to earth Lillian is, and it's clear that she's been a great influence on Westcliff, although he's still bossy as ever. If I have one complaint, it's how quickly the conflict wrapped up with Amelia's ex-love, Christopher. That was a little too abrupt. All and all, a great reintroduction to a long favorite author of mine."}, {"userName": "Rachel Reads Ravenously", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14514998-rachel-reads-ravenously", "userReview": "4.5 stars! Lisa Kleypas has become my go to author when I am in a book slump. I always enjoy her stories!!! Mine Till Midnight is the beginning of the Hathaways Sisters series, and while it doesn't explicitly say so, you need to read The Wallflowers series beforehand because SO MANY characters overlap and I feel you would be confused if you didn't.This book is about Amelia, the sister who is always looking out for her family as they experience one bad stroke of luck after the other. While looking for her brother, Amelia meets Cam Rohan, a half Roma man who helps run a gambling house. There's an instant attraction, but the two of them know their outlooks on life will keep them apart. Or will it?Seriously hot this book. I was shocked, but I felt the chemistry was perfect and things were instense between Amelia and Cam.

Instead of flying through this lightning fast like I did with the Wallflower books, I took my time and savored it, which was well worth it because Cam Rohan is like the finest, rarest dark chocolate.....exotically decadent and sinfully delicious!Mine Till Midnight is a beautiful read full of magic, mystery, lush sensuality, and enchanting romance with charming characters that you\u2019ll fall in love with, especially the dark, mysterious, devilishly sexy half-Gypsy and prosperous club owner, Cam Rohan. Although Cam longs to return to his tribal roots and yearns for the nomadic, unattached life of a true Roma, he\u2019s irresistibly drawn to strong-willed spinster Amelia Hathaway and her quirky, luckless family. Cam opens Amelia\u2019s eyes to a midnight world of magic and sensuality, and together, they experience an electric attraction, deep, intrinsic emotional connection, and volatile, lush love affair that will change them both, forever. Cam\u2019s total adoration, relentless wooing, and gentle caring and cherishing of Amelia is profoundly sweet and incredibly romantic. I just loooved him!

I have never considered myself a Historical Romance fan and yet, I have become a Hathaway addict! In this first book in the series, we are introduced to the Hathaway family. Amelia, the oldest, has spent her entire life caring for her younger siblings. After experiencing heartbreak, she has decided that she is to live the life of a spinster and spend her time taking care of her brother and little sisters. When she meets Cam Rohan, he sweeps her off of her feet. Cam is half gypsy and half Irish and has lived his life trying to find a balance between both worlds.

Cam and Amelia are a perfect match and I could not be more in love with the way Cam fought to protect Amelia and was ruthless about making her his. Amelia's family is falling apart and Cam is more than willing to step in and help her pick up the pieces and put them back together again. The transformation these characters take is beautiful.

Over the years I have found that a lot of HR will have cheating and mistresses in their books. So much so that I quit reading HR books until I discovered Goodreads and was able to see spoilers and make sure there would be no cheating in that book. I was craving some HR and a friend said to try Lisa Kleypas that they loved her. So when I was out book shopping I found the whole Hathaway Series for 4.00, bought it and here we are. My first taste of Lisa Kleypas and I loved it. I really enjoyed her writing style. I connected and fell in love with all the characters including the secondary characters which just makes me want to read all their HEAs. Mine Till Midnight, the first book in the Hathaway series, was an awesome read that did a great job of hooking me. So much so that I didn't want to stop and write a review I wanted to rush and start Winnifred and Merripen's story. \n\"You have a vivid imagination, Miss Hathaway.\" His tone was bland. But there was a flare of provoking laughter in his eyes. \"I have no such thing. The rest of my family is steeped in imagination\u2014I'm the one who clings desperately to reality.\" -Cam and Amelia\n\n\n\"God help anyone who stands in your way. You do like to manage other people's lives, don't you?\" \"Only when it's obvious I can do a better job of it than they can. What are you smiling at?\"-Cam and Amelia \nThe heroine in this book Amelia was 26 which made her a spinster. After being burnt by her ex love ( her brother's ex bf Christopher Frost) She had no desire to get married and just wanted to take care of her sisters and brother. Her brother Leo the oldest of the Hathaways, and newly titled viscount was in self destruction mode and suicidal over the death of his fiancee Laura. Amelia being the second oldest was trying to hold the family together and save her brother. Amelia was stubborn, smart and acted like a mother hen. She tried to control things and took all the family's problems (which were many) on her shoulders. Though she really wanted Cam she held him at arms length because she was worried that he would leave her like her ex or resent her for his lost of freedom. I really liked Amelia and could understand where she was coming from. I didn't fault her for holding Cam off although at times I did get frustrated with her. I did however take a star off of my rating of this book because of something she did. After her and Cam have slept together and Cam had repeatedly asked her to marry him (at this point she was still saying no to him about marriage) Cam leaves for London to get some workers for her home. While gone a bunch of shit happens and she is super upset and stressed, her ex Christopher shows up. She talks to him in which he kisses her twice! No she doesn't kiss him back, shocked she just stands there caught off guard but and here is the part that pissed me off she didn't tell him to never touch her again or slap him. Nothing! Then she doesn't' tell Cam about the two kisses although he does find out about her talking alone with Christopher. It pissed me off so much that I took a star off. This is what she should have done.....\n\n \"Stop running from me and listen. I do want you. I want you even knowing if I marry you, I've got an instant family, complete with a suicidal brother-in-law and a Gypsy houseboy with the temperament of a poked bear.\" \"Merripen is not a houseboy.\" \"Call him what you like. He comes with the Hathaways. I accept that.\"-Cam\nCam was amazing. I loved him so much. Cam was half Roma Gypsy /half Irish. He was an outcast in both worlds. He wanted for so long to fit in and be Roma and longed for the freedom of the Gypsy lifestyle that he was scared of his deep feelings for Amelia. Cam was really the best of both worlds civilized, hard working, loyal but he knew how to have fun he had a wild side and could be dangerous when needed. Cam was very charming. He wanted Amelia as his wife and he wasn't taking no for an answer. Cam was a rock for Amelia. Helping her with her family problems and just being there for her. He got her to live a little, to let go. \n\"I find you thoroughly, deeply interesting. I want to open you like a book and read every page.\" A smile curled the corners of his lips as he added huskily, \"Footnotes included.\" Feeling the stiffness of her neck muscles, he coaxed the tension out of them, kneading lightly. \"I want you. I want to lie with you beneath constellations and clouds and shade trees.\"-Cam\n\n\n\"It would be disastrous.\" Heat climbed in her breasts and throat and face. \"You would resent me for taking away your freedom and I would resent you for taking mine. I can't promise to obey you, to accept your decisions and never again be entitled to my own opinions? \"It doesn't have to be that way.\" \"Oh? Would you swear never to command me to do anything against my will?\"-Amelia and Cam\nCam and Amelia's relationship was a passionate one. Total opposites they complemented each other nicely, but also butted heads too. Which usually ended with them in bed. I really liked all of Amelia's sisters. Each had unique personalities that made them stand out as individuals. I loved Merripen was intrigued with him and Winnifred love story which is next. Leo was a sad case. My heart broke for him and in the same breathe I wanted to choke the shit out of him. I understood that he was in so much pain over losing Laura, but the things he did, the way he was reckless made me want to shake him and yell snap the hell out of it. I loved just about everything in this book and I really can't wait to start Win and Merripen's book. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves historical romances.\n\"You're not like any man I've ever known,\" she said. \"You're not even someone I could have dreamed. You're like someone from a fairy story written in a language I don't even know.\" \"The prince, I hope.\" \"No, you're the dragon, a beautiful wicked dragon.\" Her voice turned wistful. \"How could anyone have a normal everyday life with you?\"-Amelia and Cam\nhttp://jessicasoverthetopbookobsessio..."}, {"userName": "Aileene", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4150124-aileene", "userReview": "PRE-REVIEWYes, this  bearded bloke.  CHERRY POPPING  Buddy read commences on the 25th Oct.========POST-REVIEWRe-edited to add Luke's review.As promised, Frozen review for our Frozen bearded fan.Luke, who had a turn to choose for our first BR, so needless to say, my turn to select this time.Naturally, I chose SMUT and this I told him. And he said,But persistent, I was.Then Luke was like,And Aileene went,  In reality though, Luke said yes straight away. Haha. So. The story and characters.Amelia (Amuddled) Hathaway, a 26 years old lady who considered herself a spinster, had no intention of getting married as she had her dysfunctional family to looked after.Her character didn't pull me in. I didn't like her but didn't detest her either. Her siblings:Leo - after his fianc\u00e9e died due to scarlet fever, drowned himself by drinking, gambling and staying in brothels. He was suicidal and worthless.Win - she was described as the shy and quiet one, enduring every hardship without complaint. But frail and colourless due to weak lungs caused by the scarlet fever. Beatrix  - suffers from a disorder where she was unable to resist stealing items anywhere, anytime. Poppy  - is the only one I see that's seemed normal. Merripen  - I want him <---'nuff said.More characters:Cam Rohan - or sCAMbag <--- Luke approved this wholeheartedly which I later regret as he grew on me.Our bored Romeo who was very unfortunate to suffer from this good luck cursed to which he can't help but make money all the time was considering to leave everything behind and live the life of gypsy but met Amelia and wanted her for himself.He was obviously Amelia's knight in shining well-tailoured clothes sans cravat solving Amelia's problems...almost all her problems whilst sweeping her off her feet at the same time.Luke's reaction to Cam:He has his own reasons.My reaction to Cam:Only because I couldn't find anything special about him.Also the good luck curse and his love for jewelries rubbed me up the wrong way. I'm not into jewelries myself and men wearing them does not really impress me.But.Almost halfway in and all I read was almost everyone mocking him and I found myself defending him. And.His love for Amelia, I can't help but And Luke?*shakes head*The laddie has no romantic bones in that body of his. TSK. I could no longer resist his charm esp when he believes that Amelia was for him and that she would marry him no matter what. Another thing too was he's so comfortable in his own skin. He's the type of \"what you see is what you get.\"{I can totally hear your Harrumphs, Luke. Totally can feel your eye rolls too. Stop it.} Oh we also had Christopher FrosTARD not worth mentioning here but worth doing this to his face.Rating this 2 Stars.Will continue to read the series.Because.BECAUSE MERRIPEN. MERRIPEN  And of course the mystery between Merripen and Cam's similar tattoos.Thank you for buddy reading this with me,  Luke. I sure hope you enjoyed it.And yes, tagged - You're IT, mate.

He came barefoot from the direction of his bedroom. His bleary gaze moved over the pair of them.\"Why are you on the floor with your buttons undone?\"Amelia considered the question. \"I decided to have a spontaneous tryst in the middle of the hallway with a man I hardly know.\"\"Well, try to be quiet about it next time. A fellow needs his sleep.\"Amelia stared at him quizzically. \"For heaven's sake, Leo, aren't you worried that I may have been compromised?\"\"Were you?\"\"I...\" Her face turned hot as she glanced into Rohan's vivid topaz eyes. \"I don't think so.\"\"If you're not sure about it,\" Leo said, \"you probably weren't.\u201d #6. \u201cAmelia stopped before him, her skirts crowded between his parted knees. The clean, salty, evergreen scent of him drifted to her nostrils. \u201cI have a proposition for you,\u201d she said, trying for a businesslike tone. \u201cA very sensible one. You see\u2014\u201d She paused to clear her throat. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about your problem.\u201d \u201cWhat problem?\u201d Cam played lightly with the folds of her skirts, watching her face alertly. \u201cYour good-luck curse.

And touched his foot to her rapidly tapping one.\u201cHummingbird,\u201d he whispered, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to be nervous with me.\u201dGathering her courage, Amelia blurted out, \u201cI want your ring. I want never to take it off again. I want to be your romni forever\u201d\u2014she paused with a quick, abashed smile\u2014\u201cwhatever that is.\u201d\u201cMy bride. My wife.\u201d Amelia froze in a moment of throat-clenching delight as she felt him slide the gold ring onto her finger, easing it to the base.\u201cWhen we were with Leo, tonight,\u201d she said scratchily, \u201cI knew exactly how he felt about losing Laura.

Unfortunately, his story didn\u00b4t live up to my expectations. Don\u00b4t get me wrong, Cam was still as interesting as ever in 'Mine Till Midnight', but little else was up to par. :(Where do I begin? Well, let\u00b4s take Amelia Hathaway, Cam\u00b4s heroine. She was nice enough, but I just didn\u00b4t feel her \"connection\" with Cam. I got the feeling that she was more interested in her family than anything else, Cam included. When I read a romance novel, I NEED to feel that the hero and the heroine are made/meant for each other, but this didn\u00b4t happen with Cam and Amelia. To be honest, I felt sorry for Cam, because he deserved a better heroine. It also bothered me that Cam never told Amelia his tribal name. Considering his beliefs, it was the same as never saying \"I love you\" to her.As for the Hathaways as a family, the word that comes to my mind is \"dysfunctional\". Leo was a worthless, self-pitying, suicidal disaster in human form; Win was a frail, angelic beauty who had never fully recovered from her illness; Beatrix was a kleptomaniac who thought a lizard would make a wonderful pet... The only family member who seemed \"normal\" was Poppy but, even so, what kind of name was that?!? Merripen (not exactly a member of the Hathaway family, but close enough) was the most interesting secondary character in the pack and I bet he\u00b4s going to be a wonderful hero in 'Seduce Me at Sunrise'.When an author starts a series, I understand he/she has to spend some time introducing a whole bunch of characters and \"setting the stage\", so to speak, but I think Kleypas went a bit too far in this book. Ultimately, Cam and Amelia \"paid the price\": there wasn\u00b4t enough room to show the development of their relationship, because there was too much going on with the secondary characters (all aligned to be the heroes and heroines in the next Hathaways books, of course).On the happy side, I was more than pleased to see Marcus, Lord Westcliff, and Sebastian, Lord St. Vincent, making small appearances in this book. They never fail to put a smile on my face. :)All things considered, this wasn\u00b4t a bad book. But I wanted to be wowed and, unfortunately, I wasn\u00b4t."}, {"userName": "Ronyell", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1169488-ronyell", "userReview": "When I started reading Teresa Medeiros\u2019 romance novels, I started to really get into romance novels. I finally heard about another romance author and her name was Lisa Kleypas! \u201cMine Till Midnight\u201d is the first book I have read from Lisa Kleypas and it is also the first book of the Hathaway family series. If you have not read a romance novel full of sexual tension, drama and mystery, \u201cMine Till Midnight\u201d is definitely a romance novel that is worth checking out!The Hathaway family (Leo, Amelia, Winnifred, Poppy and Beatrix) all had a stroke of bad luck ever since their parents died, even living in an impoverished home in London. One day, however, the Hathaways inherited a rich estate in Hampshire and it seems that their lives would turn for the better\u2026well, not exactly. The Hathaways are still unprepared for the high class life since Leo started drinking ever since his finance, Laura, had died and her sister, Winnifred is still weak from contracting the dreaded scarlet fever along with her brother Leo. However, while Amelia stays at Hampshire, she also meets a dashing half Gypsy man named Cam Rohan, who not only helps Amelia support her family, but also satisfies Amelia\u2019s \u201csexual desires.\u201d With Cam wanting freedom from the high class society and Amelia trying to become apart of the high class society, will the two lovers ever be together? Read this book to find out!Oh my goodness! Lisa Kleypas is a true genius in writing this inspirational romance novel! Okay, let me first talk about the characters and their personalities that I really enjoyed! I just love how Lisa Kleypas created the characters to be likable and relatable as each character, mainly the Hathaways, have many issues corrupting their lives, but they are always able to overcome any obstacle that comes their way through courage and kindness among themselves. The characters I loved the most in this book are Amelia Hathaway and Cam Rohan, since this book is all about these two lovers! I loved Amelia Hathaway because she is such a strong and independent woman especially during the hardships that she and family had endured throughout this book. I loved the fact that Amelia was always willing to help out her family anyway she can even if society has looked down on her family\u2019s \u201ceccentric\u201d nature and that is the aspect that I came to love about Amelia since it showed that Amelia really cares about her family and she is always putting her family first before her own needs. Another character that I just totally flipped for was Cam Rohan! Cam Rohan literally conveys the true meaning of a \u201chandsome devil\u201d as he is perceived as a handsome yet mischievous character. Not only did I like the handsome and mischievous side of Cam Rohan, but I also loved his caring and independent nature! Cam Rohan cares deeply for Amelia and he was willing to help her out in her disastrous situations no matter how many times that other people tried to put down his efforts to help the Hathaway family. What I really loved about Cam Rohan\u2019s character is that he truly respects his Gypsy blood, even though society has shown prejudice towards his Gypsy blood and it shows that Cam is a truly independent person who never let prejudice towards his Gypsy blood discourages his spirit.Now onto the juicy parts of the story!For romance fans everywhere, there are plenty of love-making scenes between Amelia and Cam that would make your hair stand up on ends with a burning desire! The love-making scenes between Amelia and Cam are truly HOT and DELICIOUS and you would just die with passion in reading the juicy details that Lisa Kleypas puts into these scenes!For people who are not fond of sex scenes, this book has many sex scenes that might offend some people who do not like reading any sex scenes in any book.All in all, \u201cMine Till Midnight\u201d not only has hot and sensual love scenes, but it also has a true depth about the importance of family that is uncommon in many romance novels. I will admit that I was a bit confused at the beginning when I first read this book, but that was probably because I have not read the Wallflower series yet, but this fact never bothered me and this book definitely got me into Lisa Kleypas\u2019 works and I am definitely looking forward to reading more of the Hathaway series and Lisa Kleypas\u2019 works in the future!Review is also on: Rabbit Ears Book Blog"}, {"userName": "Luke Taylor", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30710594-luke-taylor", "userReview": "So what is Mine Till Midnight?Hmm...I like to think of it as maybe one of those PBS period pieces like Downton Abbey only the HBO version, if you get my drift.But what is it? Well, it\u2019s a very thinly plotted historical romance, and I liked it more than I thought I would. I chalk that up to Lisa Kleypas subtly skillful prose and the presence of a good cast and a big fat English Manor fallen into disrepair. I mean, I guess that I\u2019ve seen so many decorating and home renovation shows (and having done some architecture myself) that I actually got excited to think there would be some roll up your-sleeves home reno in this one.I thought the cast was well balanced and enjoyable, save the lecherous lead CamRohanCamRohan himself, (ugh, man...just...ugh) and whilst I didn\u2019t enjoy most of her actions, I immediately sympathised with Amelia Hathaway as the de facto mother of the family in a difficult situation, with her brother drinking himself into an apathetical death, and her other sisters being, well, a handful. So, while the staircase to the plot was that whole \u201cthe last thing you expected was to fall in love\u201d sort of thing, the only thing I didn\u2019t enjoy about the book was the romance, which felt uneasy and forced, and not romantic, giving me no slow burn \u201ckiss already\u201d tension, (and most certainly no Ryan Gosling and his many Swans) and when all was said and done, I actually found myself wondering at the fate of the Hathaway Sisters (sorry Leo, I don\u2019t much care what happens to you and your rum-soaked grief, though I understand it) and was happy to know that each future Hathaway book focuses on a different sister, which means...MERRIPEN FOR THE WIN!!!Buddy read with my good friend Aileene. And as this was her pick, I\u2019m thinking about getting her to read something epic next (because let\u2019s face it...CamRohanCamRohan is not very epic, now is he? Well...maybe in a Fabio sort of way...or a Johnny Depp sort of way. Wait...Johnny Depp? Hmm...Pirates? Yes, maybe I should get her to read about pirates...)Recommended for adults and those who like HBO/PBS mashup sort of things."}, {"userName": "Rane", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1987431-rane", "userReview": "Coming from different walks of life Amelia Hathaway and Cam Rohan couldn't be more different then day and night, but just click together like two puzzles pieces making a whole.  Amelia comes from a family of so called misfits and as the oldest female has taken the role of protector of her family's welfare at the risk of danger and the occasional headache. Coming into a recent wealth and a title for her bother to boot. Amelia and her family are thrust into a well to do society one that they have never been apart of before. Leaning how to deal with their recent rise in society and trying to keep her brother from slowly killing himself, Amelia is at the end of her rope when she meets the handsome and mysterious Cam Rohan. Cam lives in between two different worlds one that yearns for freedom and another he's been trying to live and run away from. Working at the well-known gambling club, he's surprised when he crosses paths with Amelia in her search for her way-ward brother. Even after they part with a stolen kiss, Cam still can't get Amelia out of his head and when the meet again he decides he never wants to live without her. Amelia and Cam hit it off like a house on fire, with sensual level that is always just waiting to boil over. Both try to fight the attraction between them as both feel family and freedom block their path and hold them back. Once they overcome and accept nothing will keep them apart there's no stopping them, expect for a little danger and some hard-headiness! This was such a delightful read, I loved Cam and his easy charm but his steadfastness that I felt kept Amelia grounded when things got bad. Amelia brought Cam the sense of family he felt he lacked after he was forced to leave his gypsy tribe. The scenes with them together were sometimes funny with their back and forth banter and sometimes so hot I thought the pages were going to burn up! While I enjoyed the main couple, The Hathaway clan was another matter; I liked learning about each of them and their troubles in the beginning. I felt the story started to focus a little too much on the family and not on Cam and Amelia. I didn't care for Leo as the story went on and didn't feel pity for him at the end of the book as I felt he was dragging not only himself but also his family down with him. I can understand his heartbreak over his lost love, she was gone but there was still people who loved him and needed him now more then ever, which put Cam in a better light as the stronger man as he picked up the pieces and helped the Hathaway clan more then Leo ever did.  The younger sisters were okay, but once again I felt tidbits of they're troubles would have been enough and more in-depth of their troubles could have waited for their own books, instead I was left with the feeling of being overloaded with to much at once time. Overall: even with it's flaws, a great romantic read of two people learning it's okay to have a shoulder to lean on, of wanting a family and best of all: falling in love."}, {"userName": "Susanne ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7179798-susanne", "userReview": "Updated review after re-read 5/3/15.

I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s the former because Kleypas knows her stuff when it comes to writing historical romances. With that being said, I absolutely ADORED Mine Till Midnight! Thank you Leah, my lover for sending me your copy of this book! Know that your book is well-loved and cherished in my hands! I will be picking this one up again and again to read about my baby, Cam.There are not enough words to describe how much I adore Cam Rohan! Born as half Irish and half Gypsy, Cam was separated from his tribe at a young age and lived his life within walls and ceilings instead of the great outdoors like other Roms. Becoming well-accustomed to the Gadjo culture, Cam grew successful in his life, but he still found something lacking...Until he meets Amelia Hathaway, the eldest sister of the eccentric family. Amelia has quite a lot on her hands as she tries to protect and care for her siblings. With her older brother, Leo grieving the death of his fianc\u00e9 through deadly doses of drugs and alcohol, her sister Win still weak and recovering from fever, and her two younger sisters, Poppy and Beatrix still too young to care for themselves, Amelia strives to keep herself afloat through the storm. But soon Amelia finds her safe harbour within Cam\u2019s arms as she allows someone else to care for her and her family for once. And Cam seems very pleased to be the one to do it.I adore Amelia. I thought she was the strength and glue behind the entire family, the one who held the pieces together. Her efforts to find Leo and keep him safe from himself were so mother-like and caring that I found myself respecting her more and more. Leo is completely distraught and broken in this book and I couldn\u2019t help but share his pain. Never mind his attitude and rude comments, I felt complete understanding as he frantically tried to place the slide back into the fire lantern the moment when he thought he saw Laura\u2019s face. The poor guy. The pain he must feel...Merripen feels this pain too but this time with another Hathaway sister. His heart and body burns for Win just as bad as the deadly burn he acquired during the Ramsay House fire. I can already say how much I love Kev! He\u2019s my favourite historical romance hero to date! There\u2019s just something about these Romany men I can\u2019t help but love!And lastly, I am so glad that that schmuck Frost didn\u2019t get the treasure at the end. It\u2019s a good thing Cam got there before him. The nerve of that guy to say such insults about Cam and Amelia...I\u2019ve come to adore this series and all the characters in it. Kleypas MUST have a time machine! Her work is sheer genius!Favourite Quote:Rohan's fingertips drifted with stunning delicacy over her throat, behind her ear, pushing into the satiny warmth of her hair. \"You are an interesting woman Amelia.\" Gooseflesh rose wherever his breath touched. \"I can't f-fathom why you would think so.\" His playful mouth traced the wing of her brow. \"I find you thoroughly, deeply interesting. I want to open you like a book and read every page.\" A smile curved the corners of his lips as he added huskily, \"Footnotes included.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Marilena   \u2693", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49704115-marilena", "userReview": "\u0394\u03b5\u03bd \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ac\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b5 \u03c3\u03c7\u03b5\u03b4\u03cc\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b7 \u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03ae \u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac \u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf \u03bf\u03b9 \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2.\u0398\u03b1 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03c3\u03c9 \u03cc\u03bc\u03c9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b4\u03c9 \u03c0\u03c9\u03c2 \u03b8\u03b1 \u03b5\u03be\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c7\u03b8\u03b5\u03af \u03b7 \u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 Win \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd Merippen"}, {"userName": "Beatriz", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46560610-beatriz", "userReview": "Una historia preciosa y tremendamente emotiva.

I kind of wished I didn\u2019t. This is Amelia and Cam\u2019s story, but a lot of Kev and Win\u2019s story is in this one. Kev and Win\u2019s book is the next one. So if you haven\u2019t started this series, you should start with this book.Also, when I read the other book I had a certain expectation for Leo, who is the oldest Hathaway brother, so when I read this book I was really disappointed. Just food for thought.I really liked Amelia. She\u2019s the oldest and strongest sister. She\u2019s the mama bear of the group. I liked this book, but I struggled with Leo and Amelia\u2019s feelings towards Cam. I really liked Leo so it was hard for me to read him as this self-martyr drunken guy and this isn\u2019t even his book! Leo took away a lot in this book for me.I adore Cam. I love that he is a Gypsy and he has a good luck curse where he always makes money. I love his attraction towards Amelia and they have good chemistry. Amelia was a bit difficult in my opinion, always pushing Cam away, but she did create good tension. I did like Cam chasing after her. Overall, it\u2019s a good book. I would start with this one first."}, {"userName": "Camilla *tactile seeker*", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9924828-camilla-tactile-seeker", "userReview": "What's this strange feeling that's warming me up from the inside and making me feel dizzy with joy? *looks around the room, bewildered*But yes! It's the sweet, lovely, sexy, thrilling, incredible Historical Romance expressing all its potentiality! It's been ages since I've felt this way and almost didn't recognize it.\nDear GR friends and members of this community in general, please meet Cam, the biggest HR, period movies and TV series, and history enthusiast on the planet. She's watched the Sissi films starring Romy Schneider so many times to actually be able to recite almost every characters' line by heart.\nShe's sabotaged more than one lesson at her school, taking Emma, Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice (the BBC series with Colin Firth) videotapes to class, taking advantage of her teacher's undying love for Jane Austen and hence earning her classmates' gratitude for saving them from oral tests on multiple occasions.What's strange about her though, is that she's not a romantic person. Sure, she likes it when her boyfriend gives her flowers or takes her out to dinner. She loves watching sunsets with him, but only because she loves being outdoors, spending her time immersed in nature and wants to share those moments with him.Why does she love Historical Romance so much, then? For more than one reason, actually. She loves history. Loves to read books set in distant periods of time, see how people used to live and relate with each other. She loves gowns. She finds them sexy. There's nothing more exciting than having sex with three or four layers of clothing in the way. It makes it challenging and complicated, if not frustrating. But the reward is highly satisfactory. She loves gentlemen like Cam Rohan, the book's hero, who respect women and defend them against violent, narrow-minded assholes, who think they're just a fun pastime. She loves their composure in public and goes wild for the passion and devotion they express behind closed doors. There's nothing more fascinating for a woman, than a men who can be both companion, friend and lover. Mine Till Midnight, (and I'm leaving the highly egocentric third person behind) made me forget for a few hours about how NOT romantic I was.Made my heart beat faster, harder, louder than I couldn't believe possible. Made me love each one of its characters so deeply and strongly, that I felt so bad at the idea of having to wait to read their story. One of the reason why I fell in love with this book, is definitely because of its original and modern elements.The heroine, Amelia Hathaway, has lost both her parents and has since become a mother figure for her other four siblings, three sisters and one brother, to the point of actually giving up on the chance to ever find a husband. The only man she's ever loved, abandoned her for a wealthier woman, leaving her brokenhearted and disillusioned with love.Moreover, her only brother, Leo, lost his fiancee to an horrible illness, an event that changed him into a sorrowful and reckless young man, causing more than one distress to his sister. When an unexpected inheritance elevates the whole family to the ranks of aristocracy, giving them an estate in the Hampshire, she hardly believes things could turn any better for them, but just when she couldn't be more hopeless and dejected, a beautiful, rich and extremely extravagant gipsy comes to her rescue...Girls, meet Cam Rohan: I've already briefly introduced him. Half-Romany, half-Irish, he doesn't belong to either those cultures. Abandoned by his Irish father, he lost his mother as a child and later left his beloved grandmother to move to London, where he became the factotum of the Jenner's family. (Who's read \"Devil in Winter\", knows what I'm talking about).He is (in this order): handsome, brave, incredibly intelligent, modern in the way he sees women, reliable (god knows if we need a man like that), passionate about life and super-passionate in private, a dreamer, a fighter, a survivor, mysterious, elegant, INTERESTING as in \"I can't wait to see what he does or thinks next\".He's not greedy, although he's rich. He'd rather leave everything behind and start living like his gipsy family. What makes him change his mind, is his love for Amelia.Amelia Hathaway is the most caring and stubborn young woman you could ever met. I appreciated her need to take care of her family and make sure everyone was happy, until she forgot how HER happiness was important, too.She was obviously attracted to Cam, and later in love with him, but was so preoccupied with her siblings and their issues, that she didn't allow herself to finally accept the man she was destined for to help, support and shower her with love and attentions.I might have screamed at her through my poor Kindle, for how unnerving and frustrating her behavior toward Cam was. \nI understood her motives, really, but her indecision and at times stupidity, proved to be simply too much, more than once.But it was worth it, every single curse and sigh she made me exhale.You don't get an HR better than this series, enticing, sexy, with exceptionally unique characters that will make you wish you could spend just one day in their time.Have I convinced you to read this series? Hot men who respect women and make love to them in the woods. Come on...\nEven Captain Wentworth wants you girls to give the genre a chance.\nLast but not least, I really need to thank my amazing, sweet and incredibly smart BR friends, Dulce and Anasylvia.Our joint reading was great!

After reading the Wallflower series and seeing the sex gypsy'Cam' that we all know and love. It was a thrill to read Mine Till Midnight, and even though this isn't the first time that I have read this book, I just fall in love with it every time that I read it.

I honestly haven't enjoyed a book this much in AGES. Cam Rohan is now firmly planted very close to the top of my list of all time favorite leading men.The chemistry between Cam & Amelia is just breathtaking. I have always been a sucker for an Alpha male, and Cam is about as Alpha as they come. When he finally sets his mind to having Amelia, he won't let anyone or anything stand in his way. He's fierce, compelling, intense and sexy as hell and Amelia is helpless to resist his charm...and I definitely can relate.This was my first experience reading Lisa Kleypas, and I have to admit I picked a great one to start with. From the first page, this book sucked me into the storyline, and the beautifully detailed world of the characters.I have to point out something that many of the author's fans know all too well; Lisa Kleypas not only writes a hero to die for...but she has a knack for creating the most beautifully erotic love scenes I have ever read. She has said in the past that when she writes love scenes she choreographs them down to the last detail, and it's obvious that she does just that. She somehow manages to create toe-curling encounters without ever going too far in her descriptions. Her dialogue is always perfect...no eye-rolling or giggling, the way I have found myself doing while reading love scenes in other books. She knows how to mix romantic with scorchingly hot like no one else.LK cares about every aspect of her novels, and it shows. Which is one of the many reasons she has such a devoted following. I for one consider myself lucky to include myself among them.**Read more of my reviews at my book blog**http://ravingbookaddict.blogspot.com/"}, {"userName": "Didi", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6082482-didi", "userReview": "I don't think I can say it enough: Lisa Kleypas is AMAZING.I wasn't sure what to expect at first with this book. I definitely didn't expect a ghost incorporated into the story. It sounds weird right? And though, while at first I didn't like the direction of that plot twist, it suddenly became an intricate part of the whole story making it much more mystical.But what really sold this was Cam Rohan. He was sublime. He was the alpha with the quiet disposition that could challenge the most rigorous fight while using the most gentle touch in seducing Amelia. He was enigmatic, mysterious, unpredictable and incredibly sexy. I don't often read about gypsies--last time being Jericho Barrons and that character still affects me till this day ;-D--, but I sure as hell want to if they all come looking like Cam(or Jericho, hehe!).Amelia was hard headed and annoying at times, always taking it upon herself to mind everyone's business. I understood her desire to provide structure and balance in her family especially with Leo being so incapacitated all the time. But she did go over board only to be tempered by Cam, another reason I loved him so much.This was a beautiful story giving us a glimpse of the predjudices of the day, that remain to this day unfortunately. I loved Amelia for her rejection of what society deems proper and for her bravery for deciding to be with a man that others forbade.

Cam was such an intriguing character when Kleypas gave us a peak at him before. I was actually rather disappointed that he didn't end up with Daisy. But I'm glad Kleypas brought Cam back and let us see more of him. I ended up liking him even more!The heroine of Mine Till Midnight is a \"spinster\" named Amelia Hathaway who is the de facto leader of her family. Her older brother should technically have the job, but he's floundering in gut-wrenching grief over the death of his fiance. So Amelia is in charge of taking care of her quirky family. When her brother Leo disappears again, she goes out searching with her family's \"adopted\" son, Merripen - a gypsy abandoned by his tribe and left for dead. The two encounter gaming club manager Cam Rohan who reluctantly helps them find Leo...and surprises Amelia with a searing kiss before walking away.She thinks to never see him again, but when her family moves to their new estate (from a title Leo surprisingly inherited) she's shocked to find Cam in residence visiting her new neighbor, Lord Westcliff (from the Wallflowers series). And soon the two are battling an intense attraction...but each has their own \"demons\" to battle - Amelia taking care of her family, and Cam trying to find his place in the world (be it his gypsy roots, or in the white world).I've read quite a few reviews that thought something was missing from this book, but I have to admit I really enjoyed it a lot and didn't have any major complaints. Cam was such a fascinating character to read about. He's definitely a drool worthy hero and I'm so glad Kleypas brought him back!And I actually rather liked Amelia (though I know many others didn't). True she was a bit of a control freak, trying to manage her family, but I don't think she went overboard at all. Leo needed managing, Win was ill and needed support, and the others were young. I thought Amelia was rather strong and valiant in the way she kept things together. And I definitely felt the chemistry between Cam and Amelia. That scene where he sweeps her into the night on his horse was fabulous. I actually sighed ;)The storyline mostly revolved around Amelia's family and their struggles - Leo's grief, inheriting a title, Win's illness - and all that. I didn't like Leo for most of the book, but once I got to understand his character a bit more, I just felt sad for him because he was totally lost. I'm looking forward to reading his story to see how he puts his life back together. There's also a side-story in the book of the secret love between Win and Merripen. Those two are definitely interesting...can't wait to read more about them in the next book.As a bonus for this book, we also got to see the Westcliffs (Wallflowers series) again. It was nice to get an update on them!The one this that I was rather \"blah\" about for this book was the minor supernatural element that popped up now and then. It just didn't quite fit, in my opinion and came off kinda awkward. But it was easy to overlook.Overall...I just enjoyed this one a lot...from the characters to the relationship and the low-key storyine. The book had a rather loving, sweet feel to it (at least for me). And it definitely kept me reading! I finished it in two sittings. Plus the build-up for Merripen/Win has me anxious to read the next book.
