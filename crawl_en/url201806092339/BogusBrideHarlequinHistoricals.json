Maine 1842 - Waiting on the docks for his soon to be bride, Sam was momentarily shocked to find that the wrong sister had accepted his offer. Making the best of the situation and not letting on that he had made a mistake, the marriage went forward, then he took his new wife to the lumbering camp. The characters in this story where good, the story was good, the description of Maine\u2019s forest and timber business was good, some of the writing was confusing though. Very repetitive on some points while other things seemed to get lost in the descriptions. This book was apparently named before it was written, while once or twice calling Caitlin a \u2018Bogus Bride\u2019 would have been ok, it didn\u2019t stop at that. Also, \u2018Bogus\u2019 didn\u2019t seem to fit, it was a misunderstanding, a mistake, and they made a few bad choices, but I would not consider it fake, the feelings were real for both of them, not intentionally deceitful. A decent historical romance, a few minor writing style quirks to overlook, but a good story in general."}, {"userName": "Kay Smith", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7983751-kay-smith", "userReview": "This book is terribly written. The writing skips, it tangents and is confusing. The whole premise often spins off the difference between two sisters, their names being 'Caitryn' & 'Caitlin,' (yet the book immediately drops Caitryn,) which would have been great if that's all that remains strangely ambiguous. These main characters have a huge backstory that the author tries to integrate into the current action--but for this novel, that flashback technique does not work. While describing the past, the current actions get put on the back-burner, and her synonyms get really strange, oftentimes I found myself going back to re-read sections because of its misleading syntax.The characters seem like an afterthought, and the story's concept is really the only thing the author's given this book. The premise is why I picked it up, and the premise is why I've decided to put it back down. I made it to chapter four before I called it a day. When a plot is muddled that badly by poorly written details--you're better off with another novel."}, {"userName": "Joy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1592683-joy", "userReview": "I was more than halfway through this when I set it aside for 2 months, so I am officially giving up on it. An American colonizer writes to a family in his old village to send his old friend as his bride. The wrong sister sets sail, and of course he comes to appreciate her after he marries her. The vivid, colorful scenery of the old Northeast isn't enough to make me finish the book."}, {"userName": "Aileen", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8023456-aileen", "userReview": "Caitlin Parr-Jardine is one hell of a woman! As Samuel described her, a doctor, a passionate lover and one hell of an enemy! I so love the story all in all.
