I've come to expect certain things from her novels: one astonishing, humorous transition (here, it comes early, on a train); at least 2 abrupt sexually-centered plot twists that make me exclaim out loud on the subway; a few incredible lines that border on philosophy. Most of all, there's the sense in her novels that anything is possible - as the excellent A.S. Byatt interview puts it, she has the instincts of the 19th century novelist, though she's thoroughly contemporary. One caution: DON'T READ THE BACK JACKET or any info if you are interested in this book. The first surprise in the book is wonderful if, like me, you don't see it coming.I didn't love THE BELL as much as THE SEA, THE SEA or A SEVERED HEAD, because it feels as if Murdoch is still shaking off some structural ghosts from more conventional fiction. This was her 4th novel, and the set-up is great, very reminiscent of \"Black Narcissus.\" A lay-community has set up camp in a mansion and founded a spiritual community outside the gates of an old Abbey, which is waiting for a giant bell. In her eagerness to people the community, Murdoch's generosity with supporting characters occasionally left me a bit confused (lots of boring male names), and the complexity of the set-up and the slight wrapping-up, mid-century feeling of the ending slowed me down. The three perspective characters - Dora, a flighty aspiring painter with a harsh husband; Michael, the leader of the community w/ a secret past; Toby, a teenager of boundless energy - carry this book, and Murdoch uses various bells, both metaphorical and actual, to great effect. There's a spectacular sequence with birds, and the nuns, sitting invisible on the grounds, add a unique tension to the action.Once this gets going (I don't want to spoil anything because it's so good), once it turns Murdochian, I was thrilled. There is an incredible revelation from the headlights of a car - a device she reuses almost identically in THE SEA, THE SEA - and things proceed from there with a relentless sexual logic that I adored. And the writing!\"Toby had received, though not yet digested, one of the earliest lessons of adult life: that one is never secure. At any moment one can be removed from a state of guileless serenity and plunged into the opposite, without any intermediate condition, so high about us do the waters rise of our own and other people's imperfection.\"\"Memories of the previous evening returned to him vividly, and he had a curious sense of being unfaithful, followed by a feeling of the utter messiness of everything. Violence is born of the desire to escape oneself.\"If you're interested in Murdoch, I'd start with A SEVERED HEAD so you can build trust in her capacity for insanity - I might have put this down after 40 pages if I didn't have faith in her, and I'm very glad that I didn't."}, {"userName": "BlackOxford", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17744555-blackoxford", "userReview": "Interrupting RoutineI work as tutor and librarian at Blackfriars Hall Oxford, the smallest and most medieval of the University of Oxford colleges and also a Dominican priory. A few years ago Blackfriars acquired a bell to call the friars to prayer. The sound of the bell does indeed create a definite atmosphere in the place; as also does its timing since it rings, like its larger fellow at Christ Church College, according to solar time - about six minutes behind GMT. The midday call to the Angelus therefore is somewhat disconcerting for passers by who nervously check their watches. I have come to believe that this slight disruption, this interruption, is precisely the bell\u2019s function, intended or not. Paradoxically: a routine that interrupts routine. One way to interpret Murdoch\u2019s novel is as just such an interruption in the lives of its characters.A.S. Byatt calls The Bell Murdoch\u2019s first \u2018English\u2019 novel. And it certainly creates a distinctive atmosphere, one so dense, thick, and humid in the Summer heat that it feels like green cotton wool - simultaneously inhibiting and cushioning movement. The characters, mostly middle class professionals, each might have \u2018issues\u2019; but all are nevertheless cradled in the social solidity of a 1950\u2019s bourgeois English culture that hopes against hope that it will remain 1939 forever. They live in an existential routine that seems fixed; they are stuck... largely with themselves.People \u2018get on\u2019 as if on a trajectory with the defined and relatively narrow limits of Oxbridge graduates in a post-war world they find alien and confusing. Their individual worries, however, don\u2019t inhibit their confidence, material or spiritual, in being English. They are, of course, completely unaware of this. How could it be otherwise? But their Englishness is the necessarily unstated subject of the book. The narrator would only spoil the narrative if she gave the game away; introspection is not to be encouraged, \u201cA belief in Original Sin should not lead us to probe the filth of our minds.\u201d Irony is after all English group therapy.Opening with a very civilised adultery, leading to an even more civilised reconciliation for which the outgoing lover provides transportation to the railway station, there is no conflict which can\u2019t be solved if one just has the patience to wait it out. And for heavens sake keep one\u2019s mouth shut. Intimate communication is far too perilous a venture. Much preferable to rely on one\u2019s friends to buoy one up without making a fuss, usually with a little G&T, or possibly even a bit of evening Compline before bed.The High Church tradition, the antithesis of her Irish Presbyterian background, is something Murdoch became intimately familiar with in Oxford. Her College, Somerville, is just past the end of St. Giles\u2019, a street along which John Henry Newman started his career as an Anglican vicar at one end and wound up a Catholic Cardinal at the other. Halfway along, and touching Blackfriars, is Pusey House, named for Newman\u2019s colleague in the liturgical revival of Anglicanism (the Oxford Movement in fact). Pusey House is often more Catholic than the local Catholic churches since it can both anticipate the introduction of new ritual or revert to ancient practices without consulting the Vatican (Pusey House also has the best collection of Vatican documents in Oxford).Some consider High Anglicanism to be a mimicry of Catholicism. It\u2019s not. It is true English Catholicism, or better said, Catholicism in the English mode. Many Oxford colleges conduct Evensong and Compline services daily during term, using English Plainsong or Gregorian chant according to preference. These are sensually pleasing, one might call them erotic, events. They employ all the smells and bells of Catholic ritual but also emit a vaguely camp rebelliousness - directed at both Low Church Anglicans as well as the straight-laced (historically Irish) Catholic masses.This Anglo-Catholicism provides a great deal of the dark green, cotton wool, comfort of The Bell. The enclosed convent of Anglican nuns in Imber is not an antithesis to the repressed erotic desires of the characters who fetch up together across the lake in a half-derelict country pile of Imber Court; it is a spiritual celebration of the erotic (One is reminded of Teresa of Avila and her swooning for Christ, her Spouse). I know of at least three similar communities within 15 minutes drive of Oxford. And I lived in one of these while I wrote my doctoral dissertation.*This kind of community is not a place to escape desire but a place in which desire can be explored in a way that is uniquely English: through patient ritual, agricultural and industrial as well as religious. As the medieval philosophers taught: through practice one can act one\u2019s way into a moral life. \u201cThe great thing about a dog\u201d says one of the residents \u201cis that it can be trained to love you.\u201d And not just dogs. Humans too can be taught to love trough practice; but not through conversation, idle or therapeutic. So, \u201cMeals were taken in silence at Imber.\u201dIn a sense, therefore, sex is as much a religious practice in Anglo-Catholicism as it is in the Buddhism of the Kama Sutra. It needn\u2019t be advertised as such, that would require talk which would compromise the effort fatally. But Murdoch makes the equivalence explicit in her description of the psychic state of her main character, a homosexual: \u201c...in some curious way the emotion which fed both [his religious feeling and homosexual orientation] arose deeply from the same source.\u201dEnglish resourcefulness is to be found in this dance of sex and religion, which is carried out as much to the rhythm of an English country house as of a Benedictine convent. The mustiness of each is additive: \u201cThere was a stale smell, like the smell of old bread, the smell of an institution.\u201d A concise summary really of the English Baroque. Everything is surface, but brightly lighted surface so that nothing is actually hidden, \u201cAll the electric lights were so bright at Imber.\u201dThe inhabitants are essentially misfits, and are recruited as such, \u201cpeople... who can live neither in the world nor out of it. They are a kind of sick people, whose desire for God makes them unsatisfactory citizens of an ordinary life, but whose strength or temperament fails them to surrender the world completely...\u201d Each of these defective characters has a place, a duty really, in the overall choreography of an operatic ballet in Imber Court, a definite role that fits snugly into an overall ensemble. Dora is the dim beauty, the soprano of the piece. She has no comprehension of religion and only the most instrumentally sterile view of sex; but she is not malicious, \u201cThat she had no memory made her generous.\u201d She is a central figure, a sort of goddess of creation (and of course therefore sex), who tends to get lost in Murdoch\u2019s narrative turbulence. Paul, Dora\u2019s husband, is the operatic baritone, for whom neither sex nor religion is about passion but domesticity. He desires Dora as housekeeper and mother for his children; and religion is part of an ordered family bliss. His lust, such as it is, is paterfamilial and conventional not perverse.The director/producer is Mrs. Mark (married to Mr. Mrs. Mark), a somewhat beefy person in long skirts, with \u201cwell-developed calves.\u201d She is a type of English proto-hippie perhaps, an evangelical Mrs Danvers, living a life of gentile, procedural poverty on someone else\u2019s dime, never without a \u2018cause\u2019. Without her, neither sex nor religion could flourish at Imber. She is the liturgical and social hub, the enforcer of strict adherence to the rubrics, \u201cIt\u2019s not like a hotel and we do expect our guests to fit in \u2013 and I think that\u2019s what they like best too,\u201d she politely commands. She also ensures that conversation never becomes intrusive, \u201cThat\u2019s another little religious rule that we try to follow. No gossip.\u201d What takes place outside Imber, remains outside Imber.Mrs. Mark is the agent of Michael Meade, the somewhat reluctant leader, whose family estate Imber Court is. In subsequent decades Michael would have been identified as the \u2018cult leader\u2019 of the residents, not as sinister as Jim Jones or as commercial as Werner Erhard perhaps but still of some unaccountably charismatic incompetence. Michael has been inspired by the Abbess of the Benedictine convent to \u2018minister\u2019 to folk who are neither clerical nor secular but what now might be called \u2018seekers\u2019. He is a homosexual.Catherine is the mezzo-soprano and, innovatively, the prima ballerina of the piece who is immediately identified by Dora as a rival. Catherine is imminently to become a postulant in the convent; or, as her twin brother perceives the situation, to be swallowed alive by the institutional monster of religious passion. Toby, Catherine\u2019s male sexual counterpart, is the the pious, virginal counter-tenor. He is the unsure novice, spiritually as well as sexually unformed.The eponymous bell constitutes what Alfred Hitchcock called the McGuffin - a motivating force whose function is to set the narrative in motion but that remains invisible. Essential therefore, although apparently trivial. It is Dora and Toby, at ends of the sexual/spiritual spectrum, who release the bell from the primal waters in which it has been hidden. Driven by the \u2018event\u2019 of the bell, the characters carom around the confines of Imber Court, impelling each other to acts of spiritual lust and material folly in a marvellously English way. And of course interrupting their lives profoundly, not just for them but for all of Murdoch\u2019s generation.* In fact this form of Anglo-Catholic lay community was inspired by the so-called Distributist Movement of the 1920\u2019s and 30\u2019s. This was a Catholic attempt, promoted by the likes of GK Chesterton and Hillaire Belloc, to find a \u2018middle way\u2019 between Capitalism and Communism. It\u2019s ideal was a sort of medieval economy dominated by small agricultural producers who owned and worked their own land. A few of Distributism\u2019s ideological remnants still exist in Britain, Canada and Australia."}, {"userName": "Jean", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19300421-jean", "userReview": "[The two main characters Dora and Michael are the only two remaining at Imber, since the community has broken apart.

It was the author\u2019s fourth novel, published in 1958. The story begins with young wife, Dora Greenfield, who, having left her husband, Paul, is now returning to reunite with him. Paul Greenfield is staying at Imber Court, while studying fourteenth century manuscripts at Imber Abbey, a Benedictine Convent. The lay community at Imber Court is headed by Michael Meade. The group of people staying at Imber include a young student, Toby Gash, James Tayper Pace, who had been a youth group leader in East London, Catherine Fawley, who is planning to become a nun and her twin brother, Nick, who has a drinking problem and a history with Michael, the rather bossy, Mrs Mark, and others. The Abbey is about to receive a new bell, which is to replace the missing one from the bell tower. There is a story that the original bell flew from the tower into the lake, and it is this event which forms the central strand of the novels story. However, the novel feeds off the relationships between the characters of the lay community \u2013 that \u2018buffer state\u2019 between the Abbey and the world, for those can\u2019t live either in or out of the world\u2026 As Dora and Paul play out their marital troubles in front of an audience, it soon becomes clear to Dora that their past is all too well known to the other members of the community, and, meanwhile, other relationships form and grow. Michael, troubled by the brooding presence of Nick, drinking in the lodge by the lake, is attracted to young Toby. Then Dora and Toby become involved in a drama of their own, concerning the bell.At first, I found this novel difficult to get into. I found some of the characters quite infuriating and nearly gave up. However, the writing was good enough to pull me in and, gradually, I fell into the pace of the novel. This has the feel of a sultry, English summer; when time seems to last forever and nothing ever changes. I have stayed in communities such as these, when I was younger \u2013 in my schooldays \u2013 and thought it was very well written and realistic, complete with all the repressed passions, undercurrents, resentments and petty quarrels that erupt among any group of people living together. I am glad I stayed with the book and eventually enjoyed it very much."}, {"userName": "Algernon", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4728718-algernon", "userReview": "[ Whatever could it be like to be an almost priestlike figure and yet go round kissing boys?

Blessed with luck, I encountered Iris Murdoch. Ms. Murdoch's writing style is clean and simple, and she is able to make complicated plot easy to follow. The content is not intentionally dense and the language not splendid, but she fascinates me with the eccentric and messy personalities that she portrays; gradually, I find myself full of solicitude for those fictional characters in her literary world.I find out that Ms. Murdoch, besides being a novelist, is also a philosopher, and I start to think of her literature as an imaginative humanization of abstract philosophy. I haven't read any of her philosophy but I get some idea from the title of one of Ms. Murdoch's most famous philosophical work which is Metaphysics as a Guide to Morals. The setting of The Bell, Imber Court (an Anglican lay religious community), constitutes a metaphysical system and the characters are moral persons interpreting and interacting within this metaphysical system. Metaphysics don't transcend the morals but instead serve as a mere guide for morals, and it is up to the independent moral person to construct, deconstruct, reconstruct the metaphysical reality. The submission of the self to a transcendent metaphysical system is embodied by the character James who believes: \"The chief requirement of the good life is to live without any image of oneself.\" The novel as a whole then completely shatters the viability of this vision. The self is like a bell: \"A bell is made to speak out. What would be the value of a bell which was never rung. It rings out clearly, it bears witness, it cannot speak without seeming like a call, a summons. A great bell is not to be silenced. Consider too its simplicity. There is no hidden mechanism. All that it is is plain and open.\" Even when sunk in the deep lake, the bell sends out ripples and causes emotional turmoil. There is one unique self for each individual, but from the self springs conflicting elements: in the case of Michael, both religious belief and passionate love. Rigid religious belief submits the moral self to the metaphysics, but passionate love in some sense submits the moral self to the independent moral self of another. Both can be utterly destructive. For Michael, he finally submits to love and disregards the metaphysics of religion: \"He put it to himself: there is a God, but I do not believe in Him.\" But tragically for him, the love he submits to is a hopeless one. The Bell is quite like a modern version of The Magic Mountain without difficult philosophical dialogues. Every character is highly intriguing (I especially find Michael, Noel, Nick, and Catherine fascinating). Ms. Murdoch lulls me into her fictional minds and I can find myself through the voices she utter. This is the first Murdoch novel for me, but I can foresee that in the future she might very likely replace Virginia Woolf as my favorite female writer."}, {"userName": "Candi", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3639005-candi", "userReview": "\"There were many people who can live neither in the world nor out of it. They are a kind of sick people, whose desire for God makes them unsatisfactory citizens of an ordinary life, but whose strength or temperament fails them to surrender the world completely; and present-day society, with its hurried pace and its mechanical and technical structure, offers no home to these unhappy souls. Work, as it now is can rarely offer satisfaction to the half-contemplative.\"In The Bell, we find such a group of individuals seeking a sort of spiritual retreat at Imber Court, a lay community attached to an enclosed order of nuns at Imber Abbey - or, as the Abbess puts it \"a buffer state between the Abbey and the world, a reflection, a benevolent and useful parasite, an intermediary form of life.\" Murdoch does a superb job of developing her main characters of the novel. The reader becomes quite intimate with Dora, the inexperienced, unhappy wife who has come to Imber to try to make amends with her husband while he continues manuscript research at Imber; Michael, the leader of the community who struggles with his sexuality and his religion; and Toby, a carefree, innocent young man on the verge of adulthood. Also present at Imber are an assortment of secondary characters, including Paul, the bullying husband to Dora; James, Toby's mentor and a sanctimonious member of the community; Catherine, a somewhat taciturn young woman planning to take her vows to enter the adjoining convent; Nick, brother to Catherine and a very unstable man with a history of a past relationship with Michael; and the Abbess, a very forward-thinking and compassionate nun. The pace of the novel is slow yet luxurious; the writing is so eloquent and descriptive, I just wanted to sit somewhere quietly away from the chaos of my world and immerse myself in Murdoch's prose. Descriptions of Imber Court, the abbey, the lake and the surrounding grounds were lovely. \"She leaned on the balustrade between the pillars, looking down across the terrace to the lake. The sun had gone, but the western sky to her right was still full of a murky orange glow, glittering with a few feathers of pale cloud, against which a line of trees appeared black and jaggedly clear. She could also see the silhouette of a tower, which must belong to the Abbey. The lake too was glowing very slightly, darkened nearby to blackness, yet retaining here and there upon its surface a skin of almost phosphorescent light.\" There is also a mystery about a centuries-old bell rumored to be sunk at the bottom of the lake. The story surrounding this bell adds a level of intrigue and a sense of doom that I found very alluring. This story seems to affect some members of the community in very curious ways. These characters become quite caught up in the mystery and some have even perhaps developed a fateful link to this medieval bell. The symbolism of a swinging bell also seems to represent the struggle with certain moral and religious issues with which some members of this lay community are confronted. \"The bell is subject to the force of gravity. The swing that takes it down must also take it up. So we too must learn to understand the mechanism of our spiritual energy, and find out where, for us, are the hiding places of our strength.\" Who will come through their moral and religious crises on the up-swing, so to speak? Can Dora rise above her feelings of inferiority to Paul and stand on her own two feet as his equal? Can Michael ask for forgiveness and find peace with his God? Will Toby rid himself of his confusion and rise above what he sees as a threat to his innocence? When Catherine says \"There are things one doesn't choose... I don't mean they're forced on one. But one doesn't choose them. These are often the best things.\" - What does this say about her calling to a life of devotion and seclusion? Can Nick function in a world without contact with his own sister and can he rid himself of a bitterness that has sunk him to a life of depravation? Before I wrap this up, I have to say that I just adored the Abbess in this novel. Despite her limited appearance in The Bell, she seemed to have such profound insight and I would have loved to hear from her a bit more. She imparts to Michael these brilliant words of wisdom, \"Remember that all our failures are ultimately failures in love. Imperfect love must not be condemned and rejected, but made perfect. The way is always forward, never back.\" Rich and thought-provoking, I truly enjoyed this, my first Iris Murdoch novel - it most certainly will not be my last."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5304930-mary", "userReview": "... he felt himself to be one of them, who can live neither in the world nor out of it.

Designated as such, if you can believe. Believe she knows your heart. You cannot see hers. If you can believe her as a church to walk inside of what you can live with. Behind walls, a locked door, out of confinement and patience. Perhaps from all of the time in the world. But if you touched your hand to the bars in a prison love scene would you suffocate from claustrophobic air? Mouth to mouth to know your heart. I couldn't believe. I was fascinated. There were ideas for her to suggest and no one to live with them.A young woman in Michael's religious community received her sign from God to take her own vows and enter into confinement. I believe her because she says so. It's a secret, a dreaded promise. The signs on the bottom of the cereal bowl point to a good night's sleep. Their religion is material of I will know it when I see it to shield I will deny it when it makes me alive. An ill omen, it was in the cards, how did I think I would get away with it in the end?

If the book was like when Michael walks upon the nun-to-be Catherine. Her skirt up to past her thighs. She's sitting with her brother, Michael's one time hoped for secret in the dirt rug dark. It belongs to her, the past they are gaining for a last reprieve before she never sees Nick again. Murdoch didn't have to tell me the shock, what the look away retina scarred intimacy meant. Michael afraid to look, Michael living on second and third thoughts of closeted homosexuality. Catherine's bent head looking like her brother, but not her brother. She reminds him of him. She's not him. Did he tell her about what happened when Michael was his teacher, in a past life made up of different signs pointing in the wrong direction? Of course he told her. He tells her everything. Murdoch tells me all of it. I am sitting outside the life. I can look but I cannot touch. This belongs to Catherine, though. I didn't have to be told what it meant. I wish the whole book was like that scene.'And what are the marks of innocence? Candour- a beautiful word - truthfulness, simplicity, a quite involuntary bearing of witness. The image that occurs to me here is a topical one, the image of a bell. A bell is made to speak out. What would be the value of a bell which was never rung? It rings out clearly, it bears witness, it cannot speak without seeming like a call, a summons. A great bell is not silenced. Consider too its simplicity. There is no hidden mechanism. All that it is is plain and open; and if it is moved it must ring.Nick's suicide, Catherine's schizophrenia. Did Nick live as himself when no one was around to watch him? The tree felled in the woods. Murdoch would tell you what it sounded like. No secrets. Off-stage and it's not a life. It's not a story. I never knew Nick. He exists as a sign of something around Michael's neck. Catherine's romantic love for Michael. Michael's look away lust for the young Toby. Nick confront's Toby. Please leave Nick. Please leave Catherine. Michael has second, third, fourth and fifth thoughts. I could think for him. Murdoch tells you what the next thought is before he's had it.The introduction for the Penguin classics edition said something about Murdoch's aim for the story to work for the perspective of every character. It isn't a story, though. It's the suggestion of a story. The frivolous Dora who cannot live with or without her husband, the controlling and dour Paul who loves her against his will. I don't know that he loves her. I know that he says he loves her and it is against what he would want for himself. He wears a serious expression and holds an important job that brings him to the religious community parasiting on the Abbey's reason for being. Tell me what to do. Dress me, put me in a place. Against my will, against my better judgement. I know that she has affairs, imagines the start of something with other men that she meets, this Dora who thinks a lot about not thinking. I should have been able to think for her she drones on like a life support machine. Catherine haunts the edges of her mind that would almost start to live. Unplug. Drones. Murdoch tells me this is so.Is their innocence to remain apart from their own blood, sweat, tears and dirt? Does the Abbess know them from her cell afar? They think. This means this. That means that.

they abandon them and hurt them; because they are so nice; so sweet; so defenseless. narcissistic manipulative abusive men have the world wrapped around their fingers, because the world is a constellation of countless planets that rotate around the suns of narcissistic manipulative abusive men.the tentative, delicate, ambivalent evolution of paul and dora's relationship is one of the delights of this novel. the story takes place in a lay religious community attached to a nuns' monastery (anglican benedictine) where paul goes to do research on ancient manuscripts. the nuns are cloistered but one can ask for audiences and mass is said every day at the monastery that outsiders can attend, though the design of the chapel is such that the nuns are invisible to the outsiders. dora, imprisoned in her own dreadful marriage, is horrified by the nuns' self-imposed exile and fails to see, at least at first, that they are in fact quite free and fulfilled. the lay community is a thing of beauty. it is led by a most captivating character, a gay man with a mixed past in which sexual trouble and a strong vocation to the priesthood battle each other. the community is situated in a large country mansion, run down but still beautiful, architecturally connected to the monastery, and edged by a lake. there are bridges and boats and one cannot really get out of there without using one or the other. there is also a small town one can reach on foot. the small lay community is only one year old and populated by a motley crew of idiosyncratic folks, about 10 in all. there are two leaders: michael, the real leader \u2013 a reluctant one \u2013 and james, his second in command, a man less sympathetic than our friend michael. james is a man of certainties. michael is anything but. but james means well and they all mean well and they are trying hard and deeply believe in what they are doing. they work the earth, grow their own food, have meetings, pray, share meals in silence, and enjoy the quiet and comtemplativity of their lives. the crux of the novel, it seems to me, is that religious afflatus is inevitably erotic, and this eroticism needs to go somewhere. people who are celibate by religious choice work on it all of their lives and when they work on it well (the nuns in the novel are a really good example here) they get to be lovely human beings with a purity, simplicity, youthfulness and joy that is quite beguiling. i do not actually believe that all of this comes from chastity itself. lots of married folks with the same qualities. i believe it comes to the giving of one\u2019s life, freely, to the spirit, radically, in a way that isn\u2019t driven by neurosis or bitterness or repression but true calling) the negotiation of the cravings of the body and the cravings of the soul in the name of love can mold people into a sort of perennial youthfulness. i love the way in which murdoch delves deeply inside the members of the lay community\u2019s fumblings with their exalted religiosity and their inevitably exalted eroticism (don't take my word for it; read the writings of the saints). male homosexuality is front and center here, and murdoch deals with it in a way that i found very modern. there is some inner torture in the characters, but none of it is endorsed by the author and the most balanced among them are really quite fine. in other words, this is not Giovanni's Room, which was published only two years earlier (this may have something to do with the fact that murdoch was not a gay man, though she certainly was a woman-loving woman). towards the end things move fast and there is also a great deal of set-piece comedy, until the comedy goes away and things go back to being serious. but the book never stops being warm, and affirming, and hopeful, and if you are a religious person, or a person interested in religion, and maybe also a queer person, you will find murdoch's dealing with all this simply mind-blowing."}, {"userName": "Robert", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2744544-robert", "userReview": "I really don't know why so many people like The Bell when Murdoch has written better books?

The story is about a group of rather nasty people who go on a retreat at an abbey but are entangled in each other's lives with the bell being the focal part of their lives and possibly their redemption from being materialistic and having impure thoughts.

My first novel by Iris Murdoch, but most assuredly not my last. The book is both humorous and moving.Published in 1958, 'The Bell' was Iris Murdoch's fourth novel.A young, errant wife re-joins Paul, her older, humourless and bullying husband, at Imber Court in Gloucestershire, a semi-religious lay community run by an ill-assorted group of enthusiasts, set up on the periphery of a closed order of nuns. The inhabitants of Imber Court seek a \u201crefuge from modernity\u201d. For all their higher aspirations, many of the characters are variously beset by religious yearning, sexual passion, and unspoken secrets. It\u2019s also a cautionary tale that anyone attracted to escaping the pressures of modern life by escaping to a monastery, or a closed order of nuns, should probably read. I liked how homosexuality is treated as very matter of fact. I'd guess that was quite unusual for a novel written in 1958. Indeed a person's sexuality seems of no consequence to Iris Murdoch, it's more about the effects of loving someone you're not necessarily allowed to possess. 'The Bell' is original, unpredictable, easy to read, and quietly profound. Love, goodness, and freedom seem to be the main themes, which are aligned to a compelling plot. There is much to enjoy in this story, and also much to ponder afterwards.4/5"}, {"userName": "David Rain", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10080866-david-rain", "userReview": "This was the first Iris Murdoch novel I read, many years ago now, and straight away I was hooked. For months afterwards I was obsessed with her books, and read them one after the other. Her appeal is both simple and complex. Murdoch is a great storyteller, a brilliant inventor of plots. Typically, her stories start out like realistic novels of English life, only to become increasingly bizarre, with outrageous entanglements of relationship and motive, recognitions, reversals, melodramatic confrontations, all of it mingled with ancient mythological patterns, evocative symbolism, and philosophical speculation on the meaning of good and evil (Murdoch was a distinguished academic philosopher, publishing philosophy as well as fiction). Her novels are thought-provoking, erotic, and powerfully emotional. A cynical reviewer once said that Murdoch was \u201cEnid Blyton for adults.\u201d There of those of us who consider that high praise. Murdoch wrote twenty-seven novels in all. Many consider The Bell, which is about a lay religious community, a convent, and a mysterious bell lying in the bottom of a lake, to be her best. It\u2019s certainly among the best. Other favourites of mine, and good places to start, include A Severed Head (1961), which has a plot as marvellously convoluted as a Restoration comedy; A Fairly Honourable Defeat (1970), which features a brilliant portrayal of a gay couple, Simon and Axel; The Black Prince (1973), with its Chinese-box narrative; The Sea, The Sea (1977), which deservedly won the Booker Prize; The Philosopher\u2019s Pupil (1983), Murdoch\u2019s Middlemarch, featuring an entire fictional town of Murdochian characters; and the story of guilt and atonement, The Good Apprentice (1985)."}, {"userName": "Jasmine", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17309926-jasmine", "userReview": "I added this book to my to-read shelf because of this article:https://www.theguardian.com/books/boo..."}, {"userName": "Judy", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3333943-judy", "userReview": "Iris Murdoch's fourth novel shows a strengthening of fictional power while continuing her philosophical inspection of human character. I love the opening lines: \"Dora Greenfield left her husband because she was afraid of him. She decided six months later to return to him for the same reason.\" Dora is one of the two main characters and represents the amoral personality. She is a fairly young woman, married to an older man. While living mainly on nerves and feelings, she has a horror of any sort of confinement and is allergic to boredom, but has virtually no concept of right and wrong.  The other is Michael Mead, a failed religious man who struggles with his homosexuality like a character from Graham Greene. Because sodomy is considered a sin in Christianity, Michael's deep desire to be a priest is constantly thwarted by his failure to keep his sexual desires in check. The setting is Worcestershire, England at Michael's family estate, where he has created a small lay community of Episcopalians who seek retreat from the world as they attempt to deepen and live out their Christian faith. Dora provides the comedy, which is always a flavor in Murdoch's books. Michael brings the anguish. The other characters are there to create the interactions, tensions and plot, but none are flat or feel secondary. I admired Murdoch's talent in examining such weighty ideas without judgement. If she found any of her characters unworthy, she only made it known with her tongue in her cheek. Also impressive was her range of personalities, both male and female. Besides the flighty Dora are a hardworking mother-hen type, a fairly psychotic young woman who intends to become a nun, and a deeply wise Mother Superior in the nearby convent. The eponymous bell stands for an ancient portentous legend and an object of desire, while it drives the plot. I was not wild about the long descriptive passages but did not mind the somewhat lengthy expositions on Michael's and Dora's inner lives. For some reason known only to Iris Murdoch, she used the word rebarbative about every thirty pages. A joke? Finally, it was historically fascinating to compare the mid 20th century views on male homosexuality to those of the early 21st century. Murdoch gives a clear picture of the previous mindset but was undoubtedly ahead of her time. The more Murdoch I read, the more impressed I am. I saw a comment by some reviewer the other day stating that Murdoch tells the same story over and over. I couldn't disagree more. She has that theme of human personality and interaction, but each novel I have read so far is unique."}, {"userName": "Ana ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana", "userReview": "Another amazing book from Iris Murdoch.

The Bell, however, was a tricky one for me and I believe it was largely due to the fact that there is a great deal of religious exposition and discussion in this book, lots of wringing of hands over sin and morality especially in regard to being gay and Christian.The novel centers on a lay community in Gloucestershire, England which shares its grounds with an Abbey where the nuns are cloistered. There are about six original members of the community who are joined at the beginning of the story by Paul who is researching 14th century manuscripts and then his wife Dora and an 18 year old boy, Toby.Dora Greenfield is the first character we meet in the novel and is a young, careless if not carefree woman, who has left her possessive husband for a while and has now decided she will reconcile with him at the Abbey. Despite her whimsicality Dora is a complex character whose focus on the present moment has both positives and negatives for herself and those around her.In contrast to Dora is Catherine, a virginal young woman who is about to enter the Abbey as a nun and who Dora initially resents for purely superficial reasons as she compares herself physically to the younger woman. Dora also frets for Catherine and the idea that she won\u2019t be able to leave the Abbey yet, Dora herself is similarly trapped with Paul, as she says \u2018That was marriage, thought Dora; to be enclosed in the aims of another.\u2019Toby is another young and carefree visitor to the community who provides some comic relief in his insistence of using his new word \u2018rebarbative\u2019 in an array of instances but whose innocence is challenged in his encounters with others. Innocence sullied and superficial, is part of the religious and moral aspects to the novel for there are several characters who are more than they appear, who are hiding something whether they wish to or not and this notion of secrets and suppressed and hidden identity has run through other Murdoch novels I have read recently.Dora and Toby find one another and embark upon a scheme involving the titular Bell which mirrors other 'Murdochian' plans with similar results. There is a cringe worthy quality to these ambitious plans that the reader feels cannot possibly succeed and an easing of tension when plans change. Dora and Toby seem similar, both immature and na\u00efve but Toby\u2019s naivety comes from innocence rather than ignorance and in contrast to his simple faith, Dora sees herself as a \u2018priestess\u2019 longing for attention and reverence from those around her.Michael is the other main character in the novel, a closeted and troubled gay man who is constantly measuring his desire for men against his religious faith. Iris Murdoch was aware of the homophobia of the time and I think, manages to make Michael sympathetic in his torture if his religious philosophizing and what A.S. Byatt calls his \u2018spiritual masochism\u2019, gets too much for this reader. I know from reading Liz Dexter's Iris Murdoch and the Common Reader that some readers believe Michael\u2019s behavior verges on pedophilia however, this didn\u2019t occur to me because of the way in which Murdoch writes about Nick, and the adult Nick himself is a conundrum, one of those characters that appear in Murdoch novels that are never really illuminated or explained. Other characters include James, Patches and Mrs. Mock and her husband with the first two standing in stark contrast to Michael and Dora, apparently straight shooters who find the world infinitely simple to understand while the latter two are also hiding something behind their religious convictions although we are never to know what that is.London appears as the antithesis to the community as a world where God is no longer important with Noel the journalist a strident atheist who despises the religious. It is where Dora can have freedom, looking at paintings in the National Gallery and calling them \u2018something superior and good\u2019, a secular version of the nuns and the Abbey. The community, however, has its lure, both for her and the reader and I loved the idea of living off the land and how the grounds were laid out surrounded by the water, the secluded peace of the Abbey with its high walls and the way the weather and the time of day changed its aspect. The nuns make few appearances but their serenity and strength is communicated effectively as is their simple faith.Ultimately, this novel contains Murdoch\u2019s wonderful writing, her ability to conjure up a place, characters that range in complexity and empathy and scenes of contemplation and action but the religious philosophizing and agonizing does harm the novel for someone who isn\u2019t themselves religious, who found the sermons that James and Michael give tedious and distracting and as such I can\u2019t rate this novel as highly as the three others I have read.

This is a short novel about passion, devotion, betrayal, and the strictures of society and religion. There's a frenetic energy and Iris Murdoch does not allow for many lulls in the narrative--she turns from character to character to propel the plot to a thrilling trajectory. Like The Sea, The Sea, some of the characters are magnified in scope beyond what would be realistic. But that heightened focus does not detract. This would be a good bookclub pick.

In fact, she is funny, perceptive and very easy to read. Despite the setting of this book (1950s, a lay community) and its characters (very middle class British) I found the book compelling. Written largely from the point of view of three of the characters (Dora, Michael and Toby), the language itself conveys the personalities and failings of the characters. Her handling of male homosexuality is very sensitive and believable - even more impressive given that the book first published in 1958 when homosexuality was still illegal in England. Her writing style is highly visual and creates a powerful sense of place - Imber Court and its gardens are so easy to visualise. It is a compelling read which drives you forward to its conclusion."}, {"userName": "Juli", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1438476-juli", "userReview": "A classic piece of literature. It's almost 5 stars but I think it will take a re-reading to get to 5-start status. Iris Murdoch had me at hello. The book starts with these lines:\"Dora Greenfield left her husband because she was afraid of him. She decided six months later to return to him for the same reason.\"The story is set in 1950's England but could have happened today. The Bell about a group of dysfunctional people (which means they are just like you and me) who live together in a small community near an abbey, each of whom are on a journey to figure out who they are. Murdoch paints characters that you swear you know or are. She captures the true emotions and honest wrestlings of identity and calling. Murdoch raises questions about religion, morality, idolatry, and humanity within the relationships of her characters. I got a lot more out of this one after discussion and some online reviews/commentaries. There is a lot more to this book than just a good story. Murdoch pieces the characters and the place together in brilliant ways. I did however, find it a bit tough to read sometimes - I'm not sure if it was her prose or just the classic style I had to get used to. Murdoch's writing is rich with symbolism, hard questions, and raw emotion. I look forward to reading more of her work."}, {"userName": "Monica Davis", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11497566-monica-davis", "userReview": "Three and a half stars.

Finding her seat on the train, Dora is immediately confronted by an ethical dilemma and a substantive normative ethics unfolds in her thoughts as she must decide whether or not to give up her seat for the benefit of a stranger. Of course, ethics can feature in a novel with ease and abundance, as George Eliot\u2019s work attests to, but for an author such as Murdoch it is interesting to see how her notions of moral vision seem to live quietly in the background of her work and voice themselves concurrently with her religious themes.Murdoch\u2019s best strength here must be her characters. Despite a large cast, she handles these many players with the ease of an experienced and adaptable director. Underlying the variety of her characters is her dedication to a Shakespearean tolerance that comes with recognising their differences. Her portrait of Dora as a stumbling, yet morally maturing young woman manages to obtain and vividly; her vision of Michael, struggling as he is with the dual motives of his homosexuality and religious dedication, and finding that they spring from the same source, is a singular and perfect success of characterisation; whereas, her vision of Toby as an innocent is somewhat unsettling when offset by his seeming opposite in Nick.This is a novel of characters, but the characters are broad and expansive beings whose lives are constituted and influenced by ideas. Murdoch\u2019s themes of interest here can be summarily stated as morality, sexuality and religion; however, just how unusual a picture she paints of these and how, and characteristically of her philosophical picture, she finds colours to solidify these concerns together must be responsible for the fullness and unique vision of this book."}], "description": "A lay community of thoroughly mixed-up people is encamped outside Imber Abbey, home of an order of sequestered nuns. A new bell is being installed when suddenly the old bell, a legendary symbol of religion and magic, is rediscovered. And then things begin to change. Meanwhile the wise old Abbess watches and prays and exercises discreet authority. And everyone, or almost everyone, hopes to be saved, whatever that may mean. Originally published in 1958, this funny, sad, and moving novel is about religion, sex, and the fight between good and evil.", "title": "The Bell", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10425650-the-bell", "average": 3.87, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1355940977l/10425650.jpg", "reviews": 391, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7287.Iris_Murdoch", "name": "Iris Murdoch"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4636588.A_Byatt", "name": "A.
