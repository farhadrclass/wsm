So here are some of the Ariel poems of Sylvia Plath translated into English. I have, of course, tried my utmost to perform this task with tact, discretion and good taste.ARIEL TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISHELM.Look, let's get this straight. I am a tree, you are a woman. We can never be together, not in the way you'd like, anyway. Plus, you're kind of irritating.THE RABBIT CATCHERI went out with this guy once and then I found out he liked to catch rabbits. So he was toast. I should have dimed the bastard.BERCK-PLAGEI went on holiday. Every single person in the whole hotel was talking about me behind my back. I don't like bikinis. Don't even get me started on nude beaches.THE OTHERI have something dead in my handbag. Tee hee. Also, I scratched myself and made myself bleed. I don't really recommend marriage.A BIRTHDAY PRESENTI got a present. But I was thinking that if I unwrapped it, it would bite my face off. So I didn't. Hah.THE BEE MEETINGI thought I'd like to join in village life and get involved with local societies and all that. So I went to the bee keepers' meeting. It was like something out of Alfred Hitchcock. I liked it.STINGSNow I'm a real bee keeper. I get blase about stings. It's like a metaphor.THE SWARMBees are kind of like Nazis. Or the French. I can't decide.WINTERINGCountry life can suck. I wish I was a bee. No, I don't really. That would be silly. I think it would be silly. Maybe it wouldn't be silly.A SECRETMen are like big babies that drink beer and want you to wear high class lingerie. Okay, that's not much of a secret.THE APPLICANTI got this job as a temp. So I was filing and I knew I could destroy them if I chose, just like that, but I didn't choose to that day.DADDYWhen I was little and my dad used to dress up in his SS uniform I used to think he looked so smart and handsome. Of course, later, the penny dropped.LESBOSYou really shouldn't have taken the kittens and given them to the neighbours without a by-your-leave. I think I am going to pour sulphuric acid on your head while you are sleeping. I'll do it tonight. Yes.FEVER 103I got one of those 48 hour bugs. That's why he's still alive. If I had any strength in my limbs I would have sulphuric-acided his head last night.CUTI nearly cut my fucking thumb off when I was making a casserole for a man. I jumped about swearing. I could have cut off something useful, like his member, but no, it had to be my thumb.POPPIES IN OCTOBERHave you noticed that everything is slowly dying of carbon-monoxide poisoning?LADY LAZARUSI like to commit suicide like some people like to visit their grandparents. You really don't want to, it's kind of a drag and there's nothing to do there, but you just feel you have to because you're a good person.LETTER IN NOVEMBERDear Ted - Fuck you - SylviaDEATH & COCheer up, things could be worse, I could be dead. Oh no, wait a minute - this is worse, that would be better. Hmm.SHEEP IN FOGWell, you know sheep aren't that bright to begin with. So when you mix 'em up with a thick fog, the results are hilarious."}, {"userName": "Manny", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny", "userReview": "When I was a kid, I loved stories about intrepid explorers who visited places no one had ever seen before, and died heroically in the attempt. I guess Scott of the Antarctic is the canonical example - though later on, I discovered to my surprise that Norwegians just think he was an idiot who didn't prepare carefully, and that Amundsen was the real hero. There is a wonderful episode in Jan Kj\u00e6rstad's Erobreren which contrasts the English and Norwegian views of these two great men.So what's this got to do with Ariel? I was trying to figure out why I like it so much (it's been one of my absolute favorite pieces of poetry since I first came across it as a teenager), and it struck me that maybe I admired it for similar reasons. Sylvia Plath went on an expedition to a sort of emotional Antarctica, a place most people have heard of but never visited, where you experience love so intensely that it ends up killing you. Before that happened, however, she managed to send back detailed reports of what she'd found there. Perhaps another reason why I associate her and the brave Captain Scott is that she died during the English winter of 1963. I was five at the time, and some of my first memories are of the bitter cold, and of how incredibly deep the snow was. I remember that we were snowed in, and that my father shovelled a path to the house next door, so that we could at least visit them. The snow was much higher than his head. A few hundred miles away, Sylvia had left her husband, and was living in London with her two children. She killed herself on February 11.Here are some of the passages from Ariel that I think of most often. I have always assumed that the title poem is about having sex with Ted Hughes, though I found out recently that it's also about her horse. It ends like this:...WhiteGodiva, I unpeel -Dead hands, dead stringencies.And now IFoam to wheat, a glitter of seas.The child's cryMelts in the wall.And IAm the arrow,The dew that fliesSuicidal, at one with the driveInto the redEye, the cauldron of morning.The beginning of Elm is another of my favourite passages, which expresses better than anything else I can think of just how painful love can be. I remember once showing it to a friend who's had a rather difficult life (we'd been having some discussion about poetry). She seemed almost physically affected; I remember she turned pale, and couldn't finish reading it. I wished I'd had more sense:I know the bottom, she says. I know it with my great tap root:It is what you fear.I do not fear it: I have been there.Is it the sea you hear in me,Its dissatisfactions?Or the voice of nothing, that was your madness?Love is a shadow.How you lie and cry after itListen: these are its hooves: it has gone off, like a horse.All night I shall gallop thus, impetuously,Till your head is a stone, your pillow a little turf,Echoing, echoing...And I love the end of Nick and the Candlestick, which she apparently wrote to her son, two years old at the time:O embryoRemembering, even in sleep,Your crossed position.The blood blooms cleanIn you, ruby.The painYou wake to is not yours.Love, love,I have hung our cave with roses,With soft rugs--The last of Victoriana.Let the starsPlummet to their dark address,Let the mercuricAtoms that cripple dripInto the terrible well,You are the oneSolid the spaces lean on, envious.You are the baby in the barn.I was so shocked when I read earlier this year that he had also killed himself. But when someone's written a poem like this about you, you're as immortal as the unnamed subject of Shakespeare's Sonnet XVIII.By the way, most people have been very dismissive of the movie with Gwynneth Paltrow and Daniel Craig. I seem to be one of the rare exceptions; the script was nothing special, but I thought Paltrow had done a fine job of capturing her personality on screen."}, {"userName": "Dolors", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18383778-dolors", "userReview": "Either disturbed by some haunting, otherworldly presence or simply because of the purring birdsong I awake on the early hours of this winter morning and I grab Sylvia Plath\u2019s collection of poems Ariel, which is calling to me from my bedside table. Still drowsy with soft shades of silky sheets printed on my cheeks my glassy eyes try to focus on stray words that chop like sharpened axes. Streams of unleashed running waters wash over me but fail to cleanse my soul. I am unsettled. Disturbing images flood the still pond of my mind, I feel faint visualizing drops of blood soaking weaved carpets of fluffy snowflakes drawing impossibly flowery forms on shimmering innocence, red tulips opening their moist petals aroused by treacherous dew at dawn, warmth bitterly frozen in morbid colors. Sylvia\u2019s brushstrokes combine the diluted shades of Manet with the impressionist aggressiveness and stunning tones of Pollock. Vulnerability and firm willpower are both present in form and content in this collection of poems. I encounter unapologetic Sylvia in her Lady Lazarus bewitching me with her defiant assertion: Dying Is an art, like everything else. I do it exceptionally well.\u201dAnd I force myself not to think of her tragic suicide and her mental condition when she wrote these verses. I choose to concentrate on the writer, on the genius, on the creativity which enables suffering to become universal works of art that offer comfort and redemption, on the flowing current of feeling rather than on the scabrous speculations hiding behind Sylvia\u2019s supposed products of madness. Truth is I don\u2019t want to know. Some things are best left unsought, some things need to be sensed rather than known, so I decide to surrender to Sylvia\u2019s acidic voice and let the walls of this cage dissolve away and for the briefest of moments, I taste the undistinguishable flavor of exhilarating freedom.Let the poems speak for themselves. They probe unfalteringly with sardonic disdain, they delve deep in scavenger spirit, pecking unmercifully at their own creator\u2019s flesh, they are abrupt, sarcastic, even deceitful. Sylvia\u2019s virulent words become everlasting vessels, carriers of existential vision, ships of meaning that will perpetually sail the wintry dark waters of countless readers breaking through their foggy minds and dormant hearts.I thirstily swallow these 43 naked poems trying not to choke on their rawness and I unexpectedly find myself dragged by the powerful force of this kaleidoscopic river of white pure waters, red sensual nooks and black nihilist crannies. I am lost in this world of barren landscapes and atrocious celestial bodies, of endless inner wars and abandoned children and abused fathers. But I don\u2019t want to be found. \u201cO God, I am not like youIn your vacuous black,Stars stuck all over, bright stupid confetti.Eternity bores me, I never wanted it.\u201dYearsSylvia\u2019s use of colloquial language and her disdainful tone puncture the balloon of comfort and challenge the reader, her assonant and imperfect rhymes structured in free verse blend with myth and natural imagery creating a surreal and hypnotic hum that soothes and strikes back like a cobra, drawing honest blood and recognition. \u201cWho do you think you are?A Communion wafer? Blubbery Mary?I shall take no bite of your body,Bottle in which I live,Ghastly Vatican.I am sick to death of hot salt.Green as eunuchs, your wishesHiss at my sins.Off, off, eely tentacle!There is nothing between us.\u201d MedusaSylvia\u2019s choice of words and expressions pungently resonate in this age of gender conflict, broken families and economic inequalities, the bottled rage that derives from continuous betrayal and disappointment can be softened through Plath\u2019s bitter yet courageous individuality. Some exotic birds aren\u2019t meant to be caged. It would be a sin not to allow their colorful feathers to be spread and fly away. Sylvia escaped from a colorless world to soar the skies of eternity, tingeing them with burning bright celestial pathways that enlighten the firmament of those who, from time to time, dare to look up to the floors of heaven and allow themselves to be consumed by the flames of blazing and immortal art. \u201c It is what you fear.I do not fear it: I have been there.It is the sea you hear in me,Its dissatisfactions?Or the voice of nothing, that was your madness?Love is a shadow.\u201dElm"}, {"userName": "Duane", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24389390-duane", "userReview": "What do I think? I honestly don't know. My favorite poems were Elm, The Moon and the Yew Tree, and Edge. I admit that Sylvia Plath's poetry may be beyond my ability to fullly understand. I have The Collected Poems, which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1982, on my to-read shelf. Maybe the more I read the better I will understand. There is an aura about Sylvia Plath that I find fascinating. Her writing is so unique, so different from anything else, you can't help being drawn to it, like a moth to a flame."}, {"userName": "Samadrita", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13266158-samadrita", "userReview": "It probably won't be right to draw comparisons between the Sylvia Plath who wrote Mad Girl's Love Song during her time at Smith's and the Sylvia Plath of Ariel. There's a world of difference between a Sylvia merely mourning lost love and a bitter, lonesome, vengeful, depressed Sylvia trying to live out the last vestiges of a tumultuous life by seeking a form of catharsis through these poems. And, indeed, a very personal set of poems these are. It took me a while to get through this book not only because you cannot breeze through poetry as if it were a piece of fiction. But because my obsession with Daddy, Lady Lazarus and The Applicant got in the way of my progress with the remaining poems. I think I have read the 3 at least 20 times each since the day I picked up Ariel. Merely trying to imagine the ways, in which this lady could have further overwhelmed the literary world had she lived a full life, gives me goosebumps.Who would have thought that cutting your thumb on a chopping board could transform into exquisite poetry?A million stars."}, {"userName": "7jane", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28266234-7jane", "userReview": "A collection released two years after her death, written in a grand burst of creativity just before death... I had to get this mainly because of the cover, but I can say that though I have the 'all poems' book, having this separately was worth it....And I a smiling womanI am only thirty.And like that cat I have nine times to die...(from \"Lady Lazarus\")There are so many themes I could get from here: colors (red, white, black, etc.), moods (uncertainty, calm, quiet joy, being distant), and subjects (motherhood, marriage expectations, mornings, the \"still alive\" after another suicide attempt, feverishness, something that reads like a nightmare, death-waiting, a solitary autumn walk, children with balloons...), and nature (bees, flowers, moon, night, sheep, trees..)Some poems were difficult to open, difficult to find their meaning, but that just means repeated readings might open them. But the best poem here is the very intense RAEG of \"Daddy\", that feels like your head knocking against some sudden hard surface, the language dancing on repeat around certain words, finally ending in what feeling like a shout mixed with rage-and-triumphant-joy - it is a jumping point with an exclamation mark!(There's even a small echo of it in \"Little Fugue\", I feel.)This does have a slight feel of 'last collection ever', even if not so intended. But it feels honest, and like her. I don't see myself wanting to interpret each poem here (though the themes above might be a little), but the moods seem so clear even in the poems I can't open yet. This is a quick read, yet at the same time not, since I feel rereads are ahead. Yet for a last collection, it feel like a perfect collection."}, {"userName": "Jon(athan) Nakapalau", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58774673-jon-athan-nakapalau", "userReview": "Haunting and honest - a scalpel that cuts so deep and quick you don't even feel it."}, {"userName": "Asghar Abbas", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37421322-asghar-abbas", "userReview": "I picked this up last night, wanting to read just one poem, The Moon and the Yew Tree specifically, but I ended up reading all of them, the entire book. I won't pretend to understand what most of her poems were about, but they left me in goosebumps and ashiver. I enjoyed them. What a mind, what a mind. Utterly glorious. Bane of her existence and yet because of its blackness she still exists today. Sublime work.I wish she had written more novels too. Her poetic prose and timings are undeniable. Read it. Addendum : as I was reading this it dawned on me her poems are undeniably Gothic, weird this didn't occur to me before. Her every poem makes me suck in my breath. It is hardly breaking news that she was a good poet but such terrific words, I don't even want to imagine the insides of her terrible terrible mind."}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani",

The originally published Ariel was edited by her former husband, Ted Hughes, who substituted some of her other poems written in the last months of her life. The forward by their daughter, Frieda Hughes, discusses the strengths and weaknesses of each grouping of poems, trying to be fair to each parent.The poems in Ariel are brilliant and powerful, but often sad, since they were written at a devastating time in Plath's life. Plath had suffered from depression for years, but she was at her lowest point after her husband became involved with another woman, and her marriage dissolved. Plath had some near-death experiences in her life--an accidental near-drowning at age 10 and a suicide attempt at age 20. Close to her 30th birthday, she wrote \"Lady Lazarus\" which begins:\"I have done it again.One year in every tenI manage it--\"She compares her marriage to the constriction of a snare in \"The Rabbit Catcher\":\"And we, too, had a relationship--Tight wires between us,Pegs too deep to uproot, and a mind like a ringSliding shut on some quick thing,The constriction killing me also.\"The poems are not all angry or depressing. The love she feels for her children is especially evident in \"Nick and the Candlestick\". She is holding her infant in the night, imagining the room as a mine lit by a candle:\"Love, love,I have hung our cave with roses.With soft rugs--\"As dawn is breaking, a visit to her newborn daughter in \"Morning Song\" brings these tender words:\"All night your moth-breathFlickers among the flat pink roses. I wake to listen:A far sea moves in my ear.\"Plath wrote early in the morning as the sun was rising, before her children awoke. Ariel, the name of her horse, has been compared to the writer's muse. The ending lines of the title poem \"Ariel\" are exquisite:\"The child's cryMelts in the wall.And IAm the arrow,The dew that fliesSuicidal, at one with the driveInto the redEye, the cauldron of morning.\""}, {"userName": "Magdalen", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46843838-magdalen", "userReview": "DyingIs an art, like everything else.I do it exceptionally well.I do it so it feels like hell.I do it so it feels real.I guess you could say I've a call.

Ariel is a collection of poems published posthumously, just a few years after her suicide. It is true that we have Plath to think for advancing the confessional poetry form and exploring topics previously taboo like suicide, mental illness and domestic abuse.I would like to thank Meg Wolitzer\u2019s book Belzhar for pushing me into reading more of Sylvia Plath. The book explores a struggling student that was sent to a private school that put her in a special English class. This class spent the semester journaling and reading Plath, most importantly The Bell Jar but also Ariel. That book made me want to re-read The Bell Jar which I loved but instead decided it was time to give her poetry a go.However I am very aware that I don\u2019t know how to review poetry let alone a whole collection, so this is more about my experience with this book. I feel like I am becoming a better reader but if you ask me to read out loud I am going to struggle. So I decided this is an issue I needed to work on and I read Ariel to my wife (she read some of it to me as well). This may seem like a romantic and intimate thing to do with your partner but Plath has a way of killing any sexy moods.I loved the experience but I am struck with a sense that Sylvia Plath might have been a poor choice to begin with. She has a very strong sense of imagery and plays a lot with metaphors; some of which I picked up on but there was some stuff that went over my head. Poetry is meant to be read out aloud and I thought this would help with my understanding as well as develop my skills. However I found it extremely difficult to work out punctuation in these poems. Some sentences span over a few stanzas but my natural impulse was to pause after ever line.Having said that, this was a wonderful experience and while the poems are often dark and depressing I am glad I shared this moment with my wife. Ariel kind of reminds me of those people on the internet that overshare about their lives and you can\u2019t help but be glued to what they write even if it annoys you. Sometimes I think, that is too much information but Sylvia Plath seems to get to the heart of that raw emotion.Sylvia Plath was an incredibly intelligent and complex woman; I can\u2019t help being fascinated by her. I want to learn more about her life, and understand the emotion behind her writing. Take for example her poem \u201cDaddy\u201d; there is this anger toward her father as well as some holocaust imagery that I just want to understand. I am going to have to find a biography on Plath\u2019s life because I think this places a big part in her writing. Can anyone recommend me a good biography?This review originally appeared on my blog: http://literary-exploration.com/2014/..."}, {"userName": "Chris_P", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44309339-chris-p", "userReview": "I am inhabited by a cry.Nightly, it flaps outLooking, with its hooks, for something to love\nI opened it just to get a glimpse, only an idea of Sylvia Plath's poetry and man, was I hooked!

I'm not much of a poet myself: I dabble now and again but I wouldn't call myself one. I don't feel like I have enough knowledge of the craft to fully appreciate poetry, and so I can't really comment on how good it is. Sylvia Plath is a poet I do like, but I don't love all of her poems. This collection in particular was a little bit of a mixed bag, but I feel like I'll appreciate it more and more on subsequent readings - and I will most definitely be returning to it. The majority of the poems have a strong focus on death, at least for me, which does not make for light reading. I think with a different headspace I will find a lot more to love in this collection.

What more can I say about her? I've already filled plenty of spaces praising this wondrous woman.

'They threaten / To let me through to a haven / Starless and fatherless, a dark water.''A living doll, everywhere you look. / It can sew, it can cook / It can talk, talk, talk.' 'Out of the ash / I rise with my red hair / And I eat men like air.' 'While / From the bottom of the pool, fixed stars / Govern a life.' 'I do not fear it: I have been there.' 'I am terrified by this dark thing / That sleeps in me; / All day I feel its soft, feathery turnings, its malignity.''These lamps, these planets / Falling like blessings''I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions.' With fiery intensity Plath - again - manages to use the personal trinkets of her haunted psyche to weave the most elegant and ambitious of poems. I really can't say enough about her; her words persist in resonating deep within me to this day, which I can only take to be an indicator of her immeasurable skill as a writer. Reading 'Edge' still gives me the shivers, even today.

I was captivated by the poems in Ariel and am in agreement with others who view this collection as a masterpiece. For even when I came across a poem I didn\u2019t fully understand, I could still sense the power within the words of Sylvia Plath which are precise, explosive, darkly beautiful.In the afterword to Ariel author biographer Hal Hager notes the \u201cparadoxical union of the self-destructiveness and creative energy that was the core of (Plath\u2019s) personality\u201d. This is especially evident in poems such as Lady Lazarus or Tulips that recall personal trials with attempted suicide or hospitalization. Plath\u2019s metaphors in general are frequently stark; for example, her use of Nazi imagery in Daddy or the way she seeks out the hurt within an otherwise delicate thing, as in the poem Poppies in July:Little poppies, little hell flames,Do you do no harm?You flicker. I cannot touch you.I put my hands among the flames. Nothing burns.And yet there are glimpses of love and joy in her poems too. Sylvia Plath drew inspiration from motherhood and wrote some heartwarming poems to and about her children, for example You're and Morning Song  with its most endearing of opening lines (\u201cLove set you going like a fat gold watch.\u201d) In Balloons she captures the sweetness of the \u201cguileless and clear /oval soul animals\u201d floating about the house after the holidays. Even in Nick and the Candlestick, a poem for her son that is more typical Plath in its imagery, there is a touching tenderness. She writes to her son:O love, how did you get here?O embryoRemembering, even in sleep, Your crossed position.The blood blooms cleanIn you, ruby.Just prior to her death in 1962 Sylvia Plath took up beekeeping, a fact which I found fascinating. Her father Otto Plath had been a well-known entomologist at Boston University and was considered a bee expert in his field, which likely accounted for some of her interest. This new pastime formed the foundation for a series of bee poems clustered at the center of Ariel. The poems are quirky, unconventional, and at times humorous, and show another facet to her personality. They may be my favorites of the entire book. Here she hesitates at what she has just done in The Arrival of the Bee Box:I lay my ear to furious Latin.I am not a Caesar.I have simply ordered a box of maniacs.They can be sent back.They can die, I need feed them nothing, I am the owner.In another passage she expresses so perfectly the curiosity of a woman trying to relate to her all female hive of bees (\u201cWill they hate me/ These women who only scurry/ Whose news is the open cherry, the open clover?\u201d). The entire collection left me in full appreciation of the genius that was Sylvia Plath. It is a pity to think we lost her at only 30 years of age to the suicidal depression that had haunted her for most of her life. Highly recommended for all lovers of poetry."}, {"userName": "Malak Alrashed", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2142739-malak-alrashed", "userReview": "I didn't read these poems. I studied them, I draw on the book and dreamed about Sylvia Plath world. You see I have been searching for the kind of poems that will destroy me and rebuild me again. That's what Sylvia did to me. She is not a Designed to Impress kind of writer and yet she'll use a lot of Greek Myths and history metaphors. She'll walk you in a flat land of words, not a pretentious stony one with lots of flashy words. No, just smooth words and yet you will use your dictionary quite often and add up few new words of hers. Sylvia Plath, God, Sylvia Plath. What a soul, what a poet.I've read her Novel The Bell Jar and her Unabridged Journals last year and I admit it that I couldn't quite fathom her genius that much. But after reading her poems, everything made sense. I could feel the dilemmas of Sylvia; the gigantic gap between the longings of her soul and the desperate reality of womanhood, her dead father and infidel husband.Sylvia Poetry is mysterious and savage, and her imagination goes beyond time and places. She would talk, for example, as if she's a Jew victim in the Second War and then later she'd become an object, at last, she'd become some sort of God or an evil Satan. You will not feel the headache of the time/personality switchings because she writes so well, so eloquently. What you will feel, though, is the heaviness of Sylvia's troubled soul.It was very hard to read these poems and not to imagine what Sylvia did to herself after a few days of publishing Ariel. Reading her poems felt -for me at least- like going into her inside and discovering her. I felt like I'm inside a dark forest, I saw some rivers and heard the birds singing but that was far away. I was deprived of the light and I could only feel the darkness of my surroundings."}, {"userName": "Stela", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2585926-stela", "userReview": "Ariel, Sylvia Plath\u2019s swan song, was first published by her husband Ted Hughes, who removed some poems from her manuscript and added others, composed in her last days, an act that outraged some Plath\u2019s fans, in spite of his explanation that he rearranged the poetry to recreate her life. It was said that by doing that, Hughes changed the spirit of the volume, replacing the optimism suggested by the promise of rebirth in the bees series that closed Plath\u2019s manuscript with the darkness that envelops her last two poems, Edge and Words, that conclude Hugh\u2019s edition. I\u2019m not so sure, either about the bee series optimism or the final poems pessimism. In my opinion, they are only stages, chapters of a particular odyssey, intertwining Creation and Life, in the sense that biographical aspects are projected into myth in order to metaphorically follow the creative process, from birth (inspiration), to life (creation) and death (perpetuation)From this point of view, inspiration is a new-born baby who vehemently and loudly claims his place in the world, whose cries awaken the artist and force her to fervently reconfigure her world of words:All night your moth-breathFlickers among the flat pink roses. I wake to listen:A far sea moves in my ear (Morning Song)This strange world announced by the original cry, takes its place \u201camong the elements.\u201d It is a deceitful world, where the sun of love does not bring warmness (\u201cA ring of gold with the sun in it? Lies. Lies and a grief.\u201d- The Couriers) and the dawn of knowledge does not bring light (\u201cAll morning the Morning has been blackening\u201d \u2013 Sheep in Fog) and the father, guilty of dying, does not bring safety:There's a stake in your fat black heartAnd the villagers never liked you.They are dancing and stamping on you.They always knew it was you.Daddy, daddy, you bastard, I'm through. (Daddy)It is a world that challenges the artist, provoking her to die only to call her to life again, powerful and beautiful like a Phoenix, fierce and cruel like a virgin goddess:Herr God, Herr LuciferBewareBeware.Out of the ashI rise with my red hairAnd I eat men like air. (Lady Lazarus)It is a world in white and black when it is not violently splashed with red to remind of the danger to live, of the danger to die:WhiteGodiva, I unpeel \u2013Dead hands, dead stringencies. (\u2026)And IAm the arrow,The dew that fliesSuicidal, at one with the driveInto the redEye, the cauldron of morning. (Ariel)It is a world of bee-words buzzing frenetically to break free, and disturbing the artist suddenly afraid to lift the veil, to open the box, to confront them:They might ignore me immediatelyIn my moon suit and funeral veil.I am no source of honeySo why should they turn on me?Tomorrow I will be sweet God, I will set them free.The box is only temporary. (The Arrival of the Bee Box)In such a world, the only possible refuge is death, for death only turns flesh into marble, body into statue, words into Art, Artist into her Creation:The woman is perfected.Her deadBody wears the smile of accomplishment,The illusion of a Greek necessityFlows in the scrolls of her toga (Edge)Thus, the final poems lose their gloom and become the natural conclusion of the artist\u2019s journey, a journey from zenith to nadir, a journey that did more than re-create the artist\u2019s life, it recorded the story of her creation, so beautiful in its frenzy, wildness and disarray: Words dry and riderless,The indefatigable hoof-taps.WhileFrom the bottom of the pool, fixed starsGovern a life (Words)"}, {"userName": "Satyajeet", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9692204-satyajeet", "userReview": "The short length of the book and seeming simplicity - a woman rides her horse through the countryside - is belied by the incredible amount of attention given to it. For it explores far more than a simple daybreak ride. The use of dazzling imagery, vivid emotional resonance, historical and biblical allusions, and a breathtaking sense of movement, explores several different subjects, including - poetic creativity; sexuality; animism; suicide and death; self-realization and self-transformation; and mysticism.If one is so inclined, one can even connect this interpretation to the feminist and creative interpretations to suggest that Plath's ultimate goal was to relate ecstatic frenzy - how we identify and understand the frenzy ultimately reveals our own personality and interest.
