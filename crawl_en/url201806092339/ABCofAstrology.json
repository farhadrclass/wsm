The book is broken down into twelve star signs, using the alphabet as a literary device to describe each sign. I have been an astrology lover for years, and have an extensive book collection on it. As others have mentioned, this slim paperback doesn't have anything new to offer, but it's a great introduction for the novice. Bernie Morris' descriptions of each sign are apt and I love the cover illustration."}, {"userName": "Star", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2255205-star", "userReview": "Quick and easy read!
