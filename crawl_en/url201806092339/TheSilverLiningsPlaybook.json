The Bell JarAlright, consider yourselves warned, now onward to my short review.Silver Linings is one of those books that I wouldn't normally pick up and probably wouldn't if not for wanting to read it before I watch the movie. From the trailer, I expected a pretty light hearted book with quirky characters but what I got was really different, although not entirely in a bad way. There were chapters that made me smile and chapters that made me teared but at the end of the day, I don't love this book. I saw a review on Goodreads saying that Silver Linings is like an adult Perks and I guess I do agree a little. So it's probably the case of 'it's not you, it's me' for this since I didn't exactly love Perks either."}, {"userName": "Alex ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11057966-alex", "userReview": "[ (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Ben", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/88967-ben", "userReview": "What a fun book! I\u2019m sure it\u2019s enjoyable for anyone that doesn\u2019t have a stick up their ass, but it\u2019s the kind of book that even non-readers will love, too, because it\u2019s an easy read, and the chapters are short, and it\u2019s entertaining the whole way through, and it\u2019s funny as hell. Our narrator, Pat Peoples, is pretty crazy by society\u2019s standards. He\u2019s been in \u201cthe bad place\u201d for years, and once out, with the help of his sweet mother, he\u2019s trying to get his life back on track so he can reunite with his wife, who everyone else knows won\u2019t be coming back. So Pat knows he has to be good, and he has to be careful not to hit himself in the head, or break things when he\u2019s visited by his arch nemesis, Kenny G, or punch out Giants fans in the parking lot of Lincoln Financial Field. (Although, as a diehard Giants fan, I can still tell you that the fan in this specific scene really did deserve to get punched in the face.) And Pat\u2019s struggles are exacerbated, because it seems like nobody understands him. And when it comes down to it, aside from a \u201ccrazy\u201d girl in his neighborhood, most people don\u2019t. He gets frustrated with all those chemicals within him that make him different from others. And he even knows he\u2019s different and that his head\u2019s a little skewed, but all those chemicals are so impossible to control.Yet Pat Peoples remains childlike in his optimism. He\u2019s convinced that the movie of his life will work out. If he stays good, his wife will come back and \u201capart time\u201d will end. They can even have a daughter, because he\u2019s learned and he\u2019s going to treat his wife like gold now, and he misses her so much that he kisses her picture every night before he goes to bed. And coping mechanisms like humming and counting to ten every time he sees Kenny G, help, but Pat also needs an actual outlet. He runs and works-out all day, because before he went to the bad place for apart time he let himself get to the point where he was \u201cmaybe ten to seventy pounds overweight.\u201d And putting his full self into rooting for the Eagles helps create a way to bond with his brother and his former best friend, and -- sometimes fleetingly -- his father.But of course this book isn\u2019t about football. It\u2019s about the slow, difficult growth that takes place from someone who\u2019s been through a lot of pain, and has a lot against him, not only because of his lost loves and difficult past, but because of the sickness he can\u2019t control. And it\u2019s clear that Matthew Quick knows mental illness. He\u2019s worked in the field, and is open enough to admit that he\u2019s struggled with depression himself. This is refreshing: he knows what it\u2019s like, and it shows. It\u2019s a nearly impossible feat -- making a character with such a funny outlook on life, allowing us to laugh so hard at someone who is disturbed -- all while making this same character lovable and real, and not some kind of comical caricature, but a fellow human-being open to sympathy, in need of sympathy. But somehow Quick does it.But what I really can\u2019t understand is how this Matthew Quick guy can be from the Philadelphia area -- and even worse -- root for the Eagles. He seems so nice in the e-mails we exchanged. It makes me think that maybe he\u2019s not really from the Philadelphia area at all, but maybe his publisher or someone made him change all the references he originally had in his manuscript that were about the Giants -- who must be the team he actually roots for -- to \u201cEagles\u201d and all their corresponding players, and switched their stadiums and everything else for commercial reasons or something. Because everyone knows that people from Philadelphia don\u2019t reply friendly to e-mails, especially when they\u2019re big shot authors of books that are being turned into movies. And everyone knows that the only two things Philadelphia people do well is boo at kindergarten graduations and root for evil teams like the Eagles.But I digress.Because right now I\u2019m thinking that maybe Pat Peoples isn\u2019t so crazy. While he\u2019s experienced a lot of pain, he\u2019s actually more attuned to the moods and sensitivities of others than your average person on the street. I think that\u2019s part of what makes Pat Peoples so freakin\u2019 lovable: he knows he\u2019s crazy and even calls himself mentally deranged, but he has such a soft spot for everyone. He knows how difficult life can be, and because of that awareness, he understands the struggles of others. Because of his illness he\u2019s put up with a lot of shit that most of us will never have to. But the goddamn guy remains so positive. And with therapy and medication, and friends and family, he improves. Pat Peoples made it out of the bad place, but he\u2019s not the only one who's better off because of it.Those who are different from \u201cnormal\u201d, with their outsider view of life, can wake us up from the day-to-day world we get lost in, even opening us up to bizarre humor in the most unlikely of circumstances. And I think they can teach us that \u201ccrazy\u201d isn\u2019t something to be afraid of at all; that \u201ccrazy\u201d only means that someone doesn\u2019t fit into our norms, and is mainly just straight-up misunderstood.So I dug this book. It tickled my funny bone the whole way through, and it contained valuable messages.So: 5-stars. Minus one star because I hate the Eagles, and when they came back and beat the Giants this year in the second \u201cMiracle in the Meadowlands\u201d it made me start to cry in front of my girlfriend\u2019s brother and spun me into a minor depression that only got worse the following week when I flipped-out during my layover at Atlanta International Airport as the shared communal TV showed Brandon Jacobs fumbling just as the Giants were starting to come back against the Packers and their playoff hopes were diminished right in front of my eyes as I screamed the f-word in quick succession, and wailed and got up spilling my dinner all over my lap and onto the floor and shouted and stomped, and it scared some children and I think it made two of them cry, and I had airport security eying me up and walking towards me in case I needed to be taken away. So four stars it is."}, {"userName": "Marion Hudson", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17325125-marion-hudson", "userReview": "I read many, many, many books. I am happy to read anything from classic fiction to pure escapist chic lit. I don't mind mediocre writing, gratuitous sex scenes or weak predictable plots since the authors allow me to enter another world for one or two hours every day, and for that I am grateful. Even if their books are easily forgettable, for the time that I am reading them, they are a fun way to spend my time. But every now and again a book comes along that makes me rethink my strategy of reading everything and anything. A book that is not forgettable, that is well written and that has characters I would like to meet. The Silver Linings Playbook is such a book, and as soon as I complete this review I am going to search for other books by Matthew Quick. The book is told from the perspective of Pat Peoples, intentionally named, I am sure, to be representative of all people. Since he is definitely not mentally stable, his perspective is simple and almost childlike. He has an unshakeable belief in a happy ending and is determined to take responsibility for creating his own happy ending. Through him we meet a cast of characters who are neither good nor bad, but just ordinary people who make mistakes and try to fix them. It is about the love of family, the loyalty of friends, the need to put right what is wrong and most importantly the search for happy endings.I could spend hours talking about each and every character, but that would spoil the book for you. However, Pat's mother deserves a special mention. As a mother I completely identified with her unconditional love of her son. I loved that she bought him trendy clothes and an entire home gym and know exactly why she did it. If you can't fix your child inside, then you will try to fix the outside. What you absolutely cannot do, as a mother, is nothing!Visit my Blog Another Book Blogger for more of my reviews."}, {"userName": "Amy Cane Dolzine", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4184632-amy-cane-dolzine", "userReview": "Well, thank god that's over. I don't know what's wrong with me, considering everyone else seems to think this is a good book (4 stars). Me - not so much. I can see how I would like the movie though. I should just stick with that. Maybe you just can't go from Pat Conroy's \"Lords of Discipline\" and Herman Koch's \"The Dinner\" to this ... I mean, I understand the construct - but I kind of felt like the \"diary style\" writing limited the author's ability to let me really feel the story. I was so distracted by how many times he said mundane and pedantic things like \"what felt like hours\" and \"I ran fast in that MAN gear - not because I am a MAN but because I am very good at running\" and the fact that HE NEVER USED A CONTRACTION. I mean, he would NOT use a contraction. It was so very irritating and stilted and annoying!! I have to say that the best part of the book was the trip through American Lit. I think my brain needs some good literature at this point after suffering through this. I'll go back now and read some Great Gatsby, The Scarlet Letter, A Farewell to Arms, Huck Finn.

So heartbreakingly honest... so funny and real.Pat Peoples has been in \"the bad place\" for years. He is, by anyone's definition, crazy. He's violent, he has forgotten years of his life, and his arch nemesis is jazz musician Kenny G... but he's endlessly and relentlessly hopeful. He believes in silver linings above anything else... and he believes that by trying to become the best man he can, he will eventually reach his own silver lining. His father seems to have his own issues... he is distant and moody and his affection for Pat is anything but obvious. His mother is the eternal nurturer and protector, and his younger brother supports Pat no matter what. Pat's therapist also becomes very attached to Pat and friendly with Pat as he helps him overcome his mental blocks and unstable moods. Pat Peoples is a character you cannot help but love and root for.Tiffany has been through her own struggles. She is a compulsive liar and she, too, suffers from a sickness that she cannot control. In each other, Pat and Tiffany find a common ground and a unique bond. This was just a beautifully told story about struggle and optimism. Despite everything, \"crazy\" Pat Peoples sympathizes with others. He believes in working hard for success and being kind, not right. This book has a valuable message and a wonderful delivery. I absolutely adored it."}, {"userName": "Kemper", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper", "userReview": "Pat Peoples has been confined to the \u2018bad place\u2019, but he finally gets to leave and live with his parents until he can get back on his feet. Pat\u2019s main goal is to continue on a path of self-improvement including working on being kinder, strenuous exercise and reading books so he'll be a better husband when he finally sees his beloved wife Nikki again after their \u2018apart time\u2019.Pat likes being home, but his moody father refuses to talk to him unless the Philadelphia Eagles win. Plus, his mother and his therapist are both encouraging him to spend time with Tiffany, a very strange woman who was recently widowed. It\u2019s almost like no one understands that he\u2019s still married to Nikki. As he works on becoming a better person, Pat gets to attend the Eagles home games with his brother and makes a lot of friends at the pre-game tailgates. As they start winning, the superstitious fans think that Pat is good luck, and even his father becomes much friendlier. As long as he can control his temper and continues to work hard, Pat is sure that he\u2019ll get the kind of happy ending you see in the movies.Since this is about a guy whose life has been shattered and he doesn\u2019t even realize it, you\u2019d think Pat\u2019s story would be incredibly sad. Instead, the bittersweet humor that Mathew Quick has laced the book with makes it a pleasure to read instead of a depressing slog. Pat\u2019s devotion to the cause of reuniting with Nikki can be simultaneously infuriating and endearing, and while we only get his usually slightly bewildered view point, you can also completely understand how those around him are feeling.Quick also does a particularly nice job of detailing the highs and lows of sports fandom. Pat bonds with his brother and becomes part of a community while tailgating. The team provides him a link to his emotionally distant and stubborn father. Even his therapist is a rabid Eagle\u2019s fan, and this helps Pat to trust and like him. While the games provide great entertainment and instant connections, there\u2018s also a big downside to them. An ugly incident with a rival team\u2019s fan in the parking lot illustrates how sports fans can be merciless and brutal. (It also shows that wearing a rival team\u2019s jersey to a game in Philly is a spectacularly bad idea.) Pat\u2019s dad is so wrapped up in the Eagles that a loss can make him even harder to live with. When Pat makes a commitment to Tiffany that causes him to miss some games, everyone begins blaming him for the losses.(However, I couldn\u2019t be too critical of the characters being superstitious because I wore the same red t-shirt on game day when the Kansas City Chiefs started their season with 9 straight wins. After they lost 3 in a row, I decided the shirt had run out of mojo and switched to a gold one. Since they won the next 2 games, it\u2019s obvious that the shirt I wear has a profound impact on the team.)I also very much enjoyed the movie version of this. Even though it\u2019s a fairly faithful adaptation there are also several big differences that made reading the novel surprising in several ways so this is one of those incidents where it\u2019s well worth checking out both versions."}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane", "userReview": "Update: I finished this book a day ago and it's really stayed with me. I've been thinking about the earnestness of Pat. He had such good intentions! He was focused on being kind instead of being right, which is an attitude that could help many of us. He was focused on improving his mind and on trying new things -- more positive attributes. He wanted to be nicer to his family and he exercised every day -- both good things. If he didn't have an anger problem, he would make a great friend! I increased my rating to 4 stars because of how much I have enjoyed the story, even after finishing it.Original Review: This was a fun, fast read. I like books that cover psychological and sociological aspects, and this was an interesting take on a narrator who is anxious, obsessive-compulsive and who is recovering from a trauma.It's the story of Pat, who was just released from a mental institution and is obsessed with getting back together with his ex-wife, Nikki. Pat is an optimist and only wants to hear about happy endings. He's convinced his life is a movie that will have a happy reunion with his wife if only he can improve himself enough. He exercises vigorously and has been reading classic literature when he's not working out -- he thinks Nikki will be impressed by how fit he is and how he's improving his mind. (His reactions to the plots of The Great Gatsby, A Farewell to Arms, The Bell Jar and the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn are highly amusing.)We don't learn why Pat was in the mental institution until later in the book, but we can guess it has something to do with his violent outbursts. He goes into a rage when he hears a Kenny G song, he attacks his mother and he gets into a brawl at a Philadelphia Eagles game.His first week back home with his parents, Pat gets invited to a dinner party where he meets Tiffany, who is also struggling with a trauma, and the two slowly become friends. There is a fun storyline in which the two compete in a dance contest, and Pat hopes that Nikki will be impressed that he's trying new things.I had seen the movie version, but I liked how the book fleshed out the characters and the thought processes of Pat. The writing is fairly strong and is done all in Pat's voice, so we really see his neuroses at work. We also get a better sense of the strained relationship with Pat's father, who has similar anger issues and seems to have obsessive-compulsive disorder. I would recommend the book to those who like family dramas, psychological issues or stories of redemption."}, {"userName": "Florence (Lefty) MacIntosh", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10856439-florence-lefty-macintosh", "userReview": "[A Farewell to Arms Hemingway\u2019s best love story.

And if he were still alive, I would write him a letter right now and threaten to strangle him dead with my bare hands just for being so glum.The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath:  At first, even though it is really depressing, this book excites me because it deals with mental health, a subject I am very interested in. Esther loses her virginity, hemorrhages during the process, and almost bleeds to death\u2014like Catherine in A Farewell to Arms\u2014 and I do wonder why women are always hemorrhaging in American literature.

Norton Juster It appears that this book was structured, not around a plot but around a shamelessly badly rendered character. This idea could have been surprisingly successful, if in the hands of a author who knows his craft. 2d characters. You can almost hear the echo of their cries as they wither in a lack of creativity and the weight of their soul crush monotony. The main character is a narcissistic, obsessed, child who had the cognitive abilities of a ten year old boy, pampered by a mother with low self-esteem and tremendous enmeshment issues. He seems to process information at an incredibly slow speed and perceives thing with such little competence that it is truly astonishing; think gold fish. Seriously, referring to a psychiatric facility as the \"bad place\" when he is a thirty something year old? Does he also sleep with a teddy bear and call his mom into his room, petrified of the monster in the closet?His behavior has nothing to do with his diagnosis but completely and totally everything to do with a poor conceived central character. He demonstrates borderline tendencies, but these are so poorly constructed and demonstrated that it almost distracts the reader. In the movie they outlined a decent, although simplistic illustration of bipolar disorder. In the book he pops so many pills he is a walking drug store. Even when skipping his medication he doesn't demonstrate any significant symptomatology. So, are we just to assume that the author wrote a novel about a bloated, stereotypical man?Cause Seriously that's been done. We also have a therapist that acts in an unethical, immoral, and haphazard manner. This is dangerous in a climate that isolates those who seek out therapists, and in a dangerous time in history where mental health awareness is paramount to a functioning society. There is some serious misguided bullshit here.The father/ son relationship can really be summed up by:Homer (IE father Pat Peoples): Stupid boy. All you do is cost me money. Money I could be wasting.\" (on a TV after i threw the remote at the old one)... \"Albus Dumbledore (IE: Pat Peoples): Don't ignore me\" ...Chip (IE: Pat Peoples): [being spanked as part of Omega's initiation] Thank you, sir! May I have another?....  and repeat Tension between father and son fell completely flat and was absolutely noteless. The very fabrication of this relationship was so poorly constructed that it surpasses expectations of how horrible a character's relationship with another major character could be. The dialog is tone death, the relations between characters non-distinct. The characters so under developed it seems they are a carbon copy of one another, almost cartoony in an 80s retro before technology sorta way.A rip off of about ten other books;see other reviews; http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...Trite, repetitive and under develop plot lines. It appears that little effort was put into the majority of the plot and especially the smaller sub plots. Crazy ass bastard is totally scary obsessed with his ex wife (of whom he has NOT seen for four years); it's just really creepy; like restraining order creep fest. It echos the whole box plot device of  This is Why We Broke Up ; switch out box for ex-wife. Yet, by some extraordinary means, this is even worse than  This is Why We Broke Up. A downright disgrace to a movie that, while completely and utterly flawed, at least held strings of suspense and character development. It at least had a twinkle of self respect and dignity. This book, on the other hand is the complete absence of those qualities and lacks craft, and exudes a lack of skill and sophistication.

Anyway, The Silver Linings Playbook is an engaging, poignant novel that touched a lot of things: mental health, silver linings (obviously), brotherhood, parentage, lies, friendship, love, betterment of oneself, etc. It also touched my heart, my soul, my kidney, my liver, my pancreas and ten of my vital organs lol. (Here's me doing my best to give justice on why this book is worth a read.) See, I can't articulate the right words. Hahaha.Personally, The Silver Linings Playbook book made me happy (because Jennifer Lawrence is in the cover! \"OMG Katniss what are you doing there?\") and sad at the same time. Also, hopeful. I did smile a lot and chuckled with some parts I've read and be emotional whenever Pat is in the middle of something that can crush him. It's contagious, okay. I mean I can connect well with Pat Peoples so seeing him sad makes me sad, too. But, I really felt sorry for him when the truth has been revealed, not that his efforts will be wasted but because it was really devastating knowing the truth.Besides, I love every character in this novel. They aren't one-dimensional characters because even they weren't fully fleshed-out, there are something intriguing about them that can affect the main character or even the story. Also, I didn't mind the football theme of the book. I'd rather witnessed and enjoyed the way Pat and others support their favorite team which is actually enlivening if you'd asked me.My favorite part of this book is the dance. An interpretative dance of Total Eclipse of the Heart. Oh, gods. The feels. When I'm reading this part, I swear it was breath-taking and flawless and mesmerizing that I've become emotional and feel things beyond my comprehension.With this kind novel, I don't exactly note every detail about everything. I just let the story grab and take me. I just let the words and sentences flow to its destination and enjoy or rather feel the ride. And I am thankful that it didn't disappoint.My only complain is that The Silver Linings Playbook spoiled a lot of good classic books. Oh gods no."}, {"userName": "Lee", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90786-lee", "userReview": "Here are seven weird \"bestselling writing tips\" suggested by this playbook to line writers' pockets with silver: 1. Use short chapters, with chapter titles consisting of a phrase taken from the end of each chapter We like short chapters because we like easily achievable goals (ie, I'm gonna read five more pages before I turn off the light and go to sleep -- OK, one more chapter -- OK, one more quick chapter -- and suddenly you've read fifty more pages and stayed up a while longer than expected). It also means more blank space, so after you've read three or four chapters you've turned a bunch of blank pages and therefore have turned more pages than you've read, which makes readers feel good about themselves and about the book. 2. Employ a damaged or \"off\" first-person POV (ie, narrator) to make writing easierSimple, straightforward, even somewhat degraded language and perception is an effective and popular technique because it kicks authorial shortcomings under the rug -- ie, there's no need for striking language, passages, insight etc since the narrator is damaged and fanciness (or to use the narrator's preferred term \"swankiness\") would be unrealistic. An easy way to pull this off is to define commonly known terms and do not use contractions (don't use \"don't\"). 2a. Like the \"likeability\" concept. The damaged narrator herein is likeable because he's experienced trauma and is doing what he can to overcome it. Which is inspirational. And readers like inspirational books. A more ambitious novel might associate the narrator's trauma with the country's trauma post-9/11 (not the case in this one).2b. Let the reader see around the narrator. It was moving to learn along with the narrator what he'd forgotten and what he'd missed while institutionalized (eg, the Eagles in the Super Bowl!). 2c. Bond with readers via quirky terminology. The narrator has language and behavior quirks that at first don't make much sense but over time serve as a bond between narrator and reader, like \"the bad place\" referring to the mental institution and \"apart time\" referring to the split with his wife -- also his hysterical aggressive response to the musical stylings of Kenny G.3. Set competing love interests in motion, favoring the real over the idealImpossible love interest for which the narrator obsessively pines comes up against a realistic love interest to which the narrator is pretty much oblivious. Readers like conflicting love interests, particularly when one is impossible and the other is unrecognized or smack in front of the protagonist's face (see \"Jerry Maguire\").4. Riff on popular cinematic/literary works as a substitute for insightful/thematically suggestive expositionLet's hear it for intertexuality: Narrator's ex-wife was a lit teacher so he's reading up on the American classics (Gatsby, Huck Finn, Catcher in the Rye, The Bell Jar, Farewell to Arms). Narrator very simply discusses themes and author therefore sort of deftly associates such themes and the corresponding classic novels with the novel in the reader's hands (see Special Topics in Calamity Physics). Also references \"Rocky\" and \"Empire Strikes Back\" -- classic American movies -- and the narrator refers to his life as a movie while the book itself is wholly dramatized and therefore feels \"cinematic,\" as though it might lend itself well to the big screen. The self-consciously cinematic bit where the narrative is presented as a montage like in \"Rocky\" when Stallone is training (and narrator suggests that reader hum the Rocky theme while reading) may have been where I began to feel the novel unravel a bit -- things got a little rushed about 60% through, starting with this montage, followed by short letters and clipped scenes. I didn't mind different textures in the second half of the book but I did feel like things fell off a bit as a consequence: a four-star book up until the montage?5. Serve the Community It helps to have a book deal with a microculture that most people don't have access to but which makes readers feel good when immersed in it thanks to narrator's immersion. This isn't really a book about the Eagles -- a team I've seriously rooted for since the late 1970s and read about daily even in the off-season etc -- it's about the community that revolves around the game, the fandom that brings people together. These scenes made my old heartstrings emerge. Again, it's not about the Eagles (although it nicely uses real player names and actual events in the 2006 Eagles season, for example the Terrell Owens pill overdose) -- it could've used any team with a fanatical fan base. 6. Remember that family matters, particularly father/son issues The father (portrayed by DeNiro in the movie) is a great character in this since he's clearly on the spectrum but older and therefore not diagnosed. His hysteria about the Eagles and change in general suggest a history of mental illness he's masked through routine (Eagles obsession and reading historical fiction). Meanwhile, the mother throws her hand to her mouth whenever father and son do the Eagles chant (minor point: no one yells \"ahhh\" before starting it and no one spells it out with their bodies) and sobs, which is affecting at first but over time seemed sort of sappy (ie, emotionally manipulative). The bit where the narrator takes the baby into the ocean freaked me out as the father of a one year old -- that's emotionally manipulative up the wazoo, presenting a scene involving an endangered child.7. Withhold major traumatic events until the endTraumatic events for the narrator and Tiffany were withheld to the end but their revelation was spoiled for me thanks to the movie. I'm not sure how I would've responded to the scenes at the end if I didn't already know them. They explain a lot but also it seems like the narrator would've had a history of violence or at least a few more episodes. Anyway, the traumatic events could've been revealed in the first scenes as a gripping opener but then the reader wouldn't be disoriented along with the narrator and the revelation of the major withheld plot point wouldn't be cathartic for the narrator and possibly satisfying for a reader. +Anyway, other than being a life-long Eagles fan and a Philly resident, why did I read this? I read it thanks to a friend's ranting about it recently -- he's actually been ranting about it since it came out a few years ago (I hope he has the first edition hardcover -- it's worth more than $100 these days), in part because he's a writer who wrote a semi-similar book, a memoir (Bury Me in My Jersey: A Memoir of My Father, Football, and Philly), that came out around the same time and wasn't made into an award-winning movie that surely made Matthew Quick presumably/possibly wealthy. So I was repeatedly told over the course of a few years that this novel was not something I'd like at all -- and since I also saw the movie -- I was interested in giving it a try after hearing my friend rant about it again a week or two ago. Plus, every once in a while I like to descend from hi-falutin snotty lit perch and read pop books and be reminded of the sort of thing so-called \"general readers\" like to read. In general, for me, 3.5 stars rounded down since the ending seemed sentimental and unrealistic, particularly the bit cut from the film where the narrator winds up in North Philadelphia in front of the house of his \"black friend Danny.\" (The narrator is touched, so he gets all sorts of passes a reliable narrator wouldn't -- also it's clear that the author is aware of what he's doing with the narrator's voice and perspective on race etc.) North Philadelphia is larger than most cities in the United States. It's a Christmas miracle, sure, but totally unrealistic and sort of lazy. No wonder it was cut from the movie.Other than a few stray descriptions of the Walt Whitman bridge (\"hospital green\") and the subway to North Philly (graffiti on the seats and half a cheeseburger in the middle of the aisle), Philadelphia itself isn't described much. Street names are mentioned -- he walks right past where I work and walk every day (Market Street toward the Delaware River) and they go to Pat's Steaks, two blocks from where I'm writing this now -- but he doesn't really describe what it's like. Philadelphia is sometimes referred to as \"Negadelphia,\" since many folks really do excel at pessimism, especially sports fans, so the narrator's therapy-induced optimism makes a lot of sense in this part of the world. Overall, I enjoyed reading it, wanted to read it, smiled many times and laughed a few times (mostly at the Eagles-related community stuff, particularly the Asian Invasion -- a gang of Indian men in #20 Brian Dawkins jerseys -- and when they shared chicken tikka with the narrator's friends I got a little verklempt), admired it as a guidebook for how to write a popular novel (see numbered list above), rooted for the narrator and the damaged eye-level love interest and also wanted things to work out for the mother and father. Memorable images throughout (running ten miles wearing trash bag, ordering Raisin Bran at the diner and giving a huge tip, brother playing piano in his high-rise apartment wearing Eagles jersey) but a forgettable ending, possibly in part because the traumatic episodes were spoiled for me by the film.Also, again, unlike with most books, I came to this with chronically reduced expectations thanks to my friend and after having seen the movie. Having liked the movie just fine and expecting the worst when opening the book, I was surprised it wasn't a total piece of trash -- it had some emotionally affecting bits (particularly as the narrator learns about everything he's missed over the past few years as he's been institutionalized), some funny bits, and was clear and quick for the most part (although the last third or so felt rushed). Overall, a lot like the movie, it was perfectly adequate literary entertainment with some sadness and humor and light existential lessons (AKA mainstream pop). Do I generally expect more from novels? Totally. But I felt this did a good job doing what it wanted to do: it's an accessible, sad, sometimes funny novel involving sports fanaticism and obsession/mental illness, not to mention family, hope, longing, love, loss. Final verdict: reading stuff like this reminds me why I usually read stuff unlike it, but I'm glad I read it and feel like I learned something from it about how such novels are made."}, {"userName": "Lotte", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25309949-lotte", "userReview": "The book is SO much better than the movie!

Pat is convinced that his destiny is to become more physically fit and to read more classic literature so that his estranged wife Nikki will come back to him. But now that he's at home, things aren't quite right. His family refuses to talk about his wife, his favorite football team (the Philadelphia Eagles) keeps losing games, and now a strange woman named Tiffany is starting to show interest in him \u2026This is one of the rare cases in which I saw the movie before reading the book. It's also one of the rare cases in which I think the movie did a better job with a lot of aspects of the story \u2026 but more on that later.I see I'm not the only person who thought of this book as kind of being an adult version of The Perks of Being a Wallflower. The narration was very similar, I thought\u2013\u2013very simple and to-the-point, with a lot of little philosophical tidbits frequently thrown in. And it deals with some of the same issues\u2013\u2013particularly mental health. (The stories are quite different, though.)For the most part, I thought it worked \u2026 but there were times when I was kind of confused by the structure of the narration. I think it was mentioned a few times that Pat was writing this story down, like a journal type of thing. But then a lot of it was in present tense, which felt kind of odd for a journal format. And \u2026 I don't know. It was just unclear for me.I liked the story for the most part. I think there's an important message about how things don't always turn out the way we anticipated, and sometimes it's better to just let things fall into place rather than to fight to get to an implausible goal. There are numerous \"happy endings\" that could happen, and not all of them are what we expect. However, there were some things in the execution of the story that bothered me.Probably the biggest problem for me was that I didn't feel most of the characters were very strong. Pat has a distinctive narrating voice and is a pretty good character over all \u2026 but I didn't feel like anyone else in the book was that interesting or memorable. (I don't want to constantly compare the book to the movie, but I felt the movie did a better job of characterizing everyone, even the minor characters. I thought Tiffany in particular was a much stronger character in the film.)There were also a lot of little \"quirks\" that I just didn't like. For one, I got kind of tired of Pat constantly talking about how he thinks of his life as being a movie. It's the kind of thing that could have just been mentioned once and that would've been fine. But the constant \"my life is a movie, my life is a movie\" got pretty annoying for me.Also, there was Pat's tendency to keep mentioning his (token black) friend Danny in a kind of \u2026 offensive manner. For example:\"He is also wearing a watch with diamonds all over the face, which Danny would call Jake's bling-bling.\"\u2026 *Cringe*There was also a point in the book where the narration was written in letters, which might have been okay if it had just been like, two or three letters \u2026 but it was like, ten. And that got rather tiresome in my opinion.Also, I really hate football so \u2026 the numerous football parts were very boring for me.But other than that, I thought this book was a fairly good read. I didn't think it was amazing, but it wasn't bad either. It's not executed perfectly, but it's a cute story.Anyway, I think the book and movie are both worth experiencing. (But unlike me, you should all probably read it before watching it \u2026 haha.)"}, {"userName": "Andrew Smith", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5885760-andrew-smith", "userReview": "Pat Peoples has suffered a mental breakdown following a traumatic event in his life.

He dreams of being reunited with his estranged wife, Nikki, and in the meantime he\u2019s working out (endlessly) and following his favourite American Football team, the Philadelphia Eagles. The story has already been made into a successful film it's therefore not surprising that the book very much has a film script feel. I suppose it\u2019s also an ok holiday read, which is a good thing as I got through the whole thing whilst lounging on a beach bed. It's not very long, not particularly taxing but it is reasonably entertaining. As time progresses we watch Pat struggle with his condition, become re-united with family and friends and meet a woman who is similarly recovering from a traumatic event.It's pretty clear where this one is headed from early on and despite a number of small surprises along the way it does travel the predicted path. I admire the attempt to deal with the difficult subject of mental illness but my main grumble is that the message seemed a little over-earnest for my tastes \u2013 e.g. 'try to be kind not right\u2019 was the much repeated mantra Pat had adopted from his therapist. Also the attempt to follow a successful season for the Eagles along side the main narrative felt a little overdone (I lost count of the number of times the team chant was recited!)Probably more a 2.5 than a 3 \u2013 but after a good day on the beach I'm feeling generous."}, {"userName": "Kenchiin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41280039-kenchiin", "userReview": "I really thought this was 'that stupid book' everyone loves and I would hate.

Damage is done to any meaningful public comprehension of mental illness. Just as so much literature of the past led them to believe that multiple personalities was a common solution of the afflicted to deal with life\u2019s contradictions, the outcome here is to make us believe that total mental blanking out and revision of a non-war trauma is a common or plausible response. Even for childhood trauma, the incidence of a total mental barrier of its memory, what Freud called hysteria, is not typically the mountain to mental healing and key to the work of psychotherapy as he made it out to be.

He's desperate to win his wife back, exercising to the point of obsession, and struggling to control his anger. Sounds like a bleak tone about mental illness, right? Well, actually... it really isn't at all.It's first person narrative, enabling the reader to get right in Pat's head. As we get to know him, we realise that he's desperate to be a 'nice' person and to make other people happy, and hopelessly hung up on his 'silver-lining' ending. His observations are also extremely funny at times (I loved the critiques of various classic novels - he's so right, many are so relentlessly miserable!), and the depiction of his family and friends is entirely believable - by the end of the book, you really do feel like one of the family. Tiffany is the other major character - a widow who clearly has some significant mental issues of her own, she starts to stalk Pat on his morning runs, but all verbal interactions are painfully passive/ aggressive. She serves to illustrate perfectly that there is no 'textbook' case of mental illness, and that it can be triggered by a variety of things.I totally loved this book, not least because it explores mental illness in such a warm, relatable way. It's also a book about families, about the complexity of relationships, and about the kindness of others. In a world like this, I think we all need books that emphasise these key things!"}, {"userName": "Caroline ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3236194-caroline", "userReview": "***NO SPOILERS***This book can be summed up very simply. It\u2019s about a football-obsessed, mentally ill man--Pat--who\u2019s readjusting to his life after leaving a neuropsychological facility. He spends his days exercising for literally hours and nurturing a fantasy that a reunion with his wife, Nikki, is right on the horizon. Author Matthew Quick wrote this in a humorous tone, which mostly works but would be funnier if Pat weren\u2019t annoying. Pat views the world and talks with all the sophistication of a five-year-old, and therein lies one of my main problems with this book. Although Quick never specified which mental illness Pat has, it\u2019s clear it\u2019s not severe enough to reduce him in this way. After a while I was pretty sure I hit on why Quick never got specific. By not specifying Pat\u2019s illness, Quick didn\u2019t have to work very hard to portray authenticity; he was able to mold Pat however he wished. This character therefore suffers from a medley of ailments. Is he depressed? Not really. Is he bipolar? That\u2019s also not right. Does he have borderline personality disorder? No. He also isn\u2019t psychotic, schizophrenic, psychopathic, obsessive-compulsive, or anything else concrete one can find in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Quick could so easily have decided upon something, but he just did this instead--invented a delusional, child-like 34-year-old, who is, to be blunt, not very intelligent. Reading from the perspective of a dope for 289 pages exasperated me. Then toss in an undeveloped romance with unlikable love interest Tiffany (also mentally ill and also in some vague way), and the story goes from silly to sillier. I think it\u2019s more than obvious that Quick wanted his book to be a quirky, though respectful, depiction of mental illness--but he flubbed it. Pat and Tiffany are too weird. The story comes off as rather offensive. I questioned throughout whether Quick has a true understanding of mental illness. The Silver Linings Playbook is also about football--football more than anything else. The romance and Pat\u2019s mental illness actually take a back seat to Eagles football. Quick lost his story\u2019s thread, and he did it in short order. I don\u2019t, however, feel the story totally fails, hence the two stars. This is mainly for some entertaining characters; in particular, the therapist character is a joyous addition, stealing every scene he\u2019s in. Pat\u2019s mother and father and their relationship to Pat and to each other add interesting drama and tension. Additionally, although Quick\u2019s writing is way too simplistic to be impressive, he\u2019s funny--never side-splittingly funny, but amusing, and that\u2019s something. I also give Quick credit for somehow making an incredibly football-centric story not bore me, someone who couldn\u2019t care less about football.Final verdict: Skip without hesitation.WARNING: The Silver Linings Playbook spoils major plot points and the endings of The Great Gatsby, A Farewell to Arms, The Scarlet Letter, and The Bell Jar and mildly spoils The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and The Catcher in the Rye."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4015835-michael", "userReview": "Pat Peoples is a former history teacher who moves back home after spending some time in a neurology hospital. He has a theory that every life is like a movie and he is just waiting for his silver lining ending, the successful reunion with his wife Nikki. Pat spends his time on self improvement, determined this will help end \u2018apart time\u2019, he exercises excessively and reads great American literature. He meets Tiffany and soon becomes friends because of their similarities; physically fit and clinically depressed.While this started off reminding me of The Perks of Being a Wallflower, I soon got really bored with this book. Not only was the novel predictable, it was clich\u00e9d and failed to hold my interest at all. The narrative felt really dumbed down, like it was trying more to be a YA novel; actually this might be a good example of New Adult fiction. But this really annoyed me, just because someone is clinically depressed, an exercise junky, football fan or any of the other reasons doesn\u2019t mean they are not intelligent. So the narrative felt more like the author making fun of the protagonist and I really had a problem with that.There are so many great American novels and when Pat sets out to read the entire syllabus of his wife\u2019s class to improve himself you can\u2019t help but be proud of him. The Bell Jar, The Great Gatsby and The Sun Also Rises are all great books but they don\u2019t really fit into Pat\u2019s philosophy on life. I love the way he reacts to The Sun Also Rises in the movie trailer, it was done so much better than in the book, that rage for the ending was brilliant. I know Pat wants a silver lining in every story, so I found it really amusing to think he would read those books that don\u2019t fit his personal philosophy.Personally I did want to explore more of the depression side of this novel because I felt there were some very interesting elements explored but instead the author was more interested in a clich\u00e9d romance. There were two love stories going on here, the generic one between Pat and Tiffany, and then there was the love of Philadelphia Eagles. Personally the Eagles story arc was more interesting because the Pat and Tiffany relationship was painful to read.I\u2019m not a fan of clich\u00e9s and reading about Pat and Tiffany become a real problem with me; I knew what was going to happen, I can see it coming from the start but it wasn\u2019t executed properly. Almost like the author was running out of pages and he had to quickly resolve and conflict and have a happy ending before the end of the book. The conflict resolution was done too quickly; you can\u2019t really go from hating a person to changing your mind and kissing a person that quick, it just doesn\u2019t work.There are small elements of this book that I enjoyed but the overall novel wasn\u2019t worth it. I will say one thing about this book; it will make a great movie. I\u2019ve not seen the adaptation yet but I have a feeling it would work really well in that format, as people just love a happy ending and these types of romance movies. Personally I think the book isn\u2019t work reading and maybe the movie is a quicker way to experience this story.This review orginally appeared on my blog; http://literary-exploration.com/2013/..."}, {"userName": "Robert", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5537205-robert", "userReview": "This novel felt like so much more than a debut novel.

Had I not read THE SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK, I\u2019d still be the same person I am now, but I would\u2019ve missed out on this opportunity to forget who I was for a few hours over the course of this character driven tale. Although this story is dark and psychological and filled with regret and anger and frustration, I\u2019d still say I obtained a certain amount of pleasure from this story, mainly because the characters felt lifelike with realistic problems, and I was so enamored with this tale that Pat Peoples could have been my next door neighbor and Tiffany could have lived on the next block over.And not just because Tiffany and Pat took to the pavement with as much joy as I do, getting a runner\u2019s high with every mile, the endorphins shooting through their veins the same way an IV drip would. And not just because Pat and Jake and Dr. Cliff Patel and Mr. Peoples and the Asian Invasion felt as much love for the Philadelphia Eagles as I do the Pittsburgh Steelers, bouncing on air with every win and feeling every loss like a swift kick to the groin.

And I loved the rather unique way this story was told, coupled with the eight letters in the latter half of this tale, so much so that I just had to purchase THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER, which as I understand it is told almost entirely, if not entirely, through letters and in some ways has a similar structure and feel.Had I not heard of the movie, I might not have heard of this novel, and that would have been a tragedy of infinite proportions.

Yes, Pat is a man who cries when he's being unkind. He's special that way. So everyday he improves his mind by reading books and everyday he improves his body by running and lifting weights. And he improves his soul by sincerely being friends with a woman who can give him nothing, it seems, a woman he isn't married to.My favorite scene was when Pat was holding his best friend's daughter, Emily, in the water, just treading and letting the waves and the sun embrace them and realizing in that one unexpected moment that he can be happy doing just that, just swimming with a little girl, so he kisses her chubby cheeks repeatedly and vows to create a little girl of his own. That went straight to my female heart. Very few men I know reveal their true feelings about their families and children so it's heart-warming to know when they do. Another thing of note in this book is how the author reveals our treatment of people who are mentally unstable, how we glorify their perceived weaknesses. And it's tragic how we can be unkind to and disrespectful of people who are just having a hard time dealing with all the shit the world gives them, as if we got it all figured out ourselves and that our perfect lives is something to be admired or aspired to. I like Pat Peoples, not because he's sweet in his delusion that he'll ever get back his old life, but because he sincerely wants to rebuild himself into a better man. So if all men were like Pat Peoples, I wouldn't mind if they cry over the silliest of love songs. Because if they can cry over a love song, they can cry over the smallest unkindness or injustice.

(It might not come as a surprise to learn that Pat has spent time in a mental health facility.) The problem is, Pat's now home, and everything feels off. No one will talk to him about Nikki; his beloved Philadelphia Eagles keep losing; he's being pursued by the deeply odd Tiffany; his new therapist seems to recommend adultery as a form of therapy. Plus, he's being hunted by Kenny G!In this enchanting novel, Matthew Quick takes us inside Pat's mind, showing us the world from his distorted yet endearing perspective.
