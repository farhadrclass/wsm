Shelly and Jonathan were childhood best friends who fell in love in high school. After graduation, an argument leaves them to find their own ways, apart from each other. Now, five years later, Shelly moves back to her parents' house and old memories come flooding back. When a chance encounter halfway around the world brings them back in contact, is this a sign they are meant to be? I love the little town of Glenbrooke and how the cast of characters from the series intersect in each story. As a reader who loves to find out what happens after \"the end\" of a story, it's nice to see old characters pop up in a new story, letting readers know how they are doing. The best part of a RJG novel is the soft layering of spiritual truths. Many Christian fiction books come across preachy, but with Clouds, readers discover more about God right along with the character. Shelly's story is authentic and well-developed as she finds the best love of all, Jesus, in a new way. She and Jonathan are sweet characters, and I love the development of Shelly's relationship with her sister, Meredith.Fans of RJG will love this book. If you haven't read her books, the Glenbrooke series is the place to start!I was given this book in exchange for my review. My thoughts and opinions are my own."}, {"userName": "Lena Morrison", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28404981-lena-morrison", "userReview": "I usually like Robin Jones Gunn books, but this was a slight exception. I didn't dislike it, by any means. I just didn't like it all that much. It's not even Robin that bothers me. It's the usual romance plot. It's always the same. Also, I skim-read many of the portions in this book because I felt they were unrelated to the story. I normally enjoy that about Robin's writing, but I'm honestly more in a mood for something fast-paced. So really the main problem was my mood. Anyways, the story was nice, and the romance was sweet, but very clich\u00e9."}, {"userName": "Mallory", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4333438-mallory", "userReview": "This book was like a perfect storm for me. It hit so many emotional points and I can't even explain how perfect it was for where I'm at in life right now. Her situations weren't exactly the same, but I could certainly relate to Shelly on many different levels. Gunn is at her best when her characters are in the messy reality that is life. Shelly's trip perfectly encapsulates how travel can be both an escape, allowing for insights that one can't reach at home, but also how often it fails to live up to personal expectations. Ultimately, things don't happen when we think they ought to or when we want them to occur, but in God's perfect timing. When all the pieces lock into place, it's marvelous to see. Is this actually a 5-star novel? Not really. So far, though, it's my favorite in this series."}, {"userName": "Destiny Ann", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49544402-destiny-ann", "userReview": "I FINISHED IT!

Some folks may consider them a nuisance to a day of catching some sunshine on a sandy beach. Others may view them as beautiful mountains of hope. Still others might look up at an overcast sky and see a comforting blanket that reminds them of marshmallows bobbing up and down in their mom's homemade hot cocoa.In Clouds, flight attendant Shelly Graham thinks \"no human could mar their perfection.\" (page 50) They offer her a subtle reminder of God's perfect love as her life crumbles into an enormous pile of tattered dreams. Her dream job is threatened by airline cutbacks. Her little sister gets to live in Shelly's dream cabin. When she bumps into her childhood best friend and true love, reality splashes ice cold water on her dream future: Jonathan's engaged to be married! Just as the clouds in the sky adapt to God's weather plans, can Shelly adapt to the crushing news pouring all around her? Will a journey into her family's history spark an inner expedition to a Love stronger and steadier than the one she lost?Clouds by Robin Jones Gunn (www.RobinGunn.com) offers an innocence that is so often lost in today's modern world. Even though this fifth installment in The Glenbrooke Series is a contemporary tale, it still manages to take us back to a slower paced, more meaningful time when families were close-knit and pleasantly, if somewhat irritatingly, meddlesome and everyone hopes for a happily-ever-after. This is by far the sweetest, most heartfelt story I've read all year, and I look forward to reading more of The Glenbrooke Series by Robin Jones Gunn. This novel provides a fresh perspective on God's way of working things out according to His divine plan.Robin beautifully combined location and history and character to weave a truly touching masterpiece. I was quickly endeared to Shelly and her treasure box of long-forgotten memories. My emotions were on the line nearly as much as Shelly's as I experienced the highs and lows of adventure and lost love right along with her.Here are two quotes from Clouds that struck my heart as particularly meaningful:\"Sometimes to find the key that will unlock the future, we have to see what keys we buried in the past.\" (page 37)\"What has been is in the past. What is forms the present. What will be remains to be seen.\" (page 134)What keys from your past will clear the clouds from your future?Thank you to WaterBrook Multnomah for giving me a free copy of this novel for this review.You may read a free preview of Clouds here: http://www.scribd.com/doc/91174486/Cl..."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1427816-karen", "userReview": "The main character, Shelly, followed her own path after high school, leaving behind her childhood friend/high school sweetheart, breaking his heart. Jonathan and Shelly end up meeting again 5 years later in Germany, where he announces his engagement to another woman. Shelly goes through a lot of changes in her personal life and, more importantly, in her spiritual life during this time. With upheaval in her job & living arrangements, she begins stressing about becoming a spinster (at 23!) and starts looking back on her life. After trying to figure it all out on her own, she begins to develop a real relationship with Christ, learning what is really important in life and learning to trust God to take care of her. He's got it all under control and we have to have faith in Him to work everything out. Philippians 4:6-7 Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. God's plan will unfold in His timing. We shouldn't worry about the details. He will take care of us if we trust Him and follow His lead. I'm facing a lot of changes in my own life right now and I needed this reminder to trust in Him to work everything out. You know what they say - We plan, God laughs! God has perfect timing and we all need to recognize that He's pulling the strings and it'll all be okay. The scripture above has been directed at me a few times recently. I've hear 3 sermons about this very thing just in the past week. And now this book. I think God's trying to tell me something... I get it! I'm supposed to relax and let God work it out. Now I'm excited to see what He has in store for me!

Robin does have good characters, but these stories seen to drag and then finish all in a hurry with blunt speeches and cute cliches.

When the two broke up, they both split separate ways \u2013 Shelly to a flight attendant school and Jonathan to college in different states. Coming back home to where she grew up after a sudden change of plans in her life, Shelly can't help the flooding of memories from her childhood that keep coming back alive more then ever. Yet she feels lost with no direction and strangely alone.When Meredith, her sister asks Shelly to go to Germany she unexpectedly runs into Jonathan only to find out that her long lost love is engaged. Shelly had never meant to hurt her best friend, or run away from him after he tried to propose to her \u2013 but learning about the engagement she couldn't help but stand and watch her love slip away.This was a really cute and touching story. I found myself reading until I literally passed out from the lack of sleep. I kept saying one more chapter, but the chapter turned into well over 200 pages into the wee hours of the morning. I couldn't put it down. It is always so amazing to find beautiful written work. A clean inspirational christian romance, about a woman who not only learns a lesson of the heart but also finds her lost faith all over again.I couldn't help but fall in love with these two and my heart broke at their story. The way the two got together and the way Shelly broke up with him at the young age left an aching sadness that left me feeling sorry for Jonathan. I understood a bit later why she had done it. Being at such an early age presented with something that felt like it was putting her dreams on her, or perhaps not even including them \u2013 felt overwhelming. In a sense, part of this story reminded me of what my husband and I went through and how the two of us got back together after a few years pursuing our own thing in two separate states. The book was heartwarming and the ending, thought predictable, satisfying and beautiful.Meredith was an amazing sister and I loved everything she had done for Shelly and the way the two had grown together after Shelly made her way back home. I didn't like Jonathan's fiancee, but that was a given :). Still, the journey of the heart was what kept me reading this book, needing and wanting Jonathan and Shelly back together since it hit so close to my own relationship. Amazing book, and I will be looking forward to more of this authors writing."}, {"userName": "Robin", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5567357-robin", "userReview": "CloudsRobin Jones GunnBook Summary: This bestselling former Palisades release is book five in the new Glenbrooke series by award-winning author Robin Jones Gunn. Shelly Graham has moved home to Glenbrooke, where she's flooded with memories of her high school sweetheart, who took off for Europe after they broke up. But when Shelly travels to Germany, she suddenly runs into the former boyfriend who has filled her thoughts. Learning that Jonathan is engaged, Shelly hides her feelings for him. After returning home, however, she must face these feelings, especially after her path crosses Jonathan's yet again. Only this time, if they can find the strength to be honest, they just might discover what God has in store. She remembers their childhood with longing their parting with regret... Coming home wasn't supposed to feel this way. After five years as a flight attendant, Shelly is home again, in a house alive with happy memories. Yet she feels strangely lost. Without direction. Alone. Where is Jonathan Renrield when she needs him? Jonathan, her best friend nearly all her life, her first and only love. Shelly hadn't meant to hurt him when she left him behind to chase her dreams. And she misses him more than she's ever admitted. When they unexpectedly meet in Germany , Shelly manages to hide her feelings from Jonathan-and his fianc\u00e9e. But she can no longer hide them from herself. Will she ever be ready to tell Jonathan the truth? Will she have the chance? Not until a business trip takes her to charming Glenbrooke , Oregon does Shelly finally understand: only the truth can set her free. But is it too late for her and Jonathan?Review: I grow fonder of this book every day. When I first read it I enjoyed the twists and the turns, the clever dialog and how well written it is. I now can appreciate it from time and experiences and realize that sometimes what we look for when we are younger have flaws that bring us rewards greater than we can ever imagine. For me this is just such a book because a first love is precious but to mature it and care for it are a tremendous responsibility. It is always romantic to ponder the \u2018what ifs\u2019 in life. This book delves into this with heart wrenching moments and with many exciting backdrops of Germany and Oregon. I enjoy the ancillary things in books sometimes more than the big themes for me it is upon those little details that build believability. It is always a pleasure to read a writer who crafts a well written tale. Thanks to Robin Jones Gunn and God for the gifts he gives of ideas along with the talent to write."}, {"userName": "Mandolin", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3324944-mandolin", "userReview": "Five years ago, Shelly Graham left her home in Seattle to pursue her dream of becoming an airline stewardess and exploring the world. In her decision to place her independence above all else, she left behind her best friend and love of her life, Jonathan. Locking up the look of utter grief he gave her and the harsh words they traded on the night she turned down his proposal, Shelly thought she had put their past and its hurts behind her. When Shelly's forced to return home to live with her parents, she's faced with a flood of memories that threaten to break her heart. Finally realizing that her search for independence has caused her to push aside the ones she loves most, Shelly begins to understand the wrong she did to her old friend and to grieve for their lost love. When she has the chance to reconnect with him on a trip to Europe, Shelly's hopes for a forgiveness-filled reunion and a bright future together blossom but quickly fade when she encounters Jonathan again - with his new fiancee in tow. Reeling from the pain of losing him before she even had a chance, Shelly returns home in search for hope and healing and a new direction for the future. Her once exciting career is slowly dying and her dreams seem pointless without Jonathan to share them. But a God who loves her relentlessly is pursuing her and may just have a few silver linings to shed on her grey clouds.This fifth book in the Glenbrooke series (which, as an aside, do not have to be read in any particular order) is another stellar example of Gunn's talent as a writer. Though her writing tends to be a little bit more \"flowery\" than I like, the overall effect is one that feels nurturing to the soul. Her rose-colored descriptions lend a peaceful, welcoming feel to her books that support their ultimate message: love is out there for everyone, no matter how unlikely it seems. Her characters ring true and the situations they find themselves in are realistic and believable. Though the tone of all of her books is most assuredly faith-based, they never seem preachy or overly religious. My only quibble with this book was that portions like Shelly's multiple periods of introspection and self-analysis were a bit slow and drawn-out, making it longer than it really needed to be. Overall, though, because I related so well with Shelly's situation and the issues she struggled with, I did enjoy it very much and am happy to give it a four star rating!I received a copy of this book from the publisher in return for an unbiased and fair review."}, {"userName": "Ionia", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16434239-ionia", "userReview": "WARNING: May contain a minor spoiler:This was a difficult book for me to make a decision on. I love this author and this book has some fabulous descriptions and character development. Still, after reading the rest of this series, I didn't feel that this book was quite as exciting and endearing as the others. It was still worth reading, but wasn't my absolute favorite.What I did like about this novel, was that there was a certain mystery to what would happen between the two main characters from the beginning. Where a lot of the time you can pretty much tell how a story is going to end, this book could have gone any number of ways. I thought the author did a good job of giving me a reason to keep turning pages, as I was uncertain of which direction she would take to come to a resolution. I liked the main female character very much; although I didn't feel that Jonathan's character was as involved as he could have been.I thought the setting was interesting and worth reading about. The way Robin Jones Gunn chose more than one location gave this novel more appeal for me as I was interested in the various places she described. The love story itself was well written. I could feel the highs and lows of the main character's emotions as she struggled with what her heart was telling her and her relationship with God. I thought that when the author brought Jonathan back at the end of the book the way she detailed his decision being based on the desire of God was wonderful.As always, the human to creator relationship that Robin Jones Gunn has written in this book is something to marvel at. She seems to have a unique understanding of faith, life and relationships that many authors cannot successfully reflect in Christian romance. If you have read the other books in this series this novel is a nice compliment to the rest of the books. I would also like to recommend \"Secrets\" as it was my favorite book in this series.I received a copy of this book for my review by the publisher Waterbrook Multnomah Publishing.

After that commitment, she looks at things differently. I like Robin Jones Gunn\u2019s writing and am a fan of many of her series including the Glenbrooke series.

They even rigged a bucket on a rope between their upstairs bedrooms to send things back and forth to each other. Shelly grew up wanting to see the world and decided that she would be an airline hostess. Jonathan intended to go to college and because he was a little older than Shelly, was scheduled to leave home first. During their last conversation together, something went very wrong and both did not speak to each other again before they parted ways to begin their lives away from home.Shelly fell victim to the financial crunch and was transferred from her dream job in L.A. to the SeaTac airport in Seattle/Tacoma Washington. She moved back into her parents\u2019 home for a while before sharing an apartment with her sister. She never forgot Jonathan and always wondered what happened to him. She and her sister Meri went to Germany to check on a Christian Camp in order to start a similar one back at home. Shelly and Meri found that Jonathan was a part of this Christian Camp. Now it\u2019s up to the two of them whether or not their friendship continues or founders.Although I enjoyed this book, it is not one of my favorites. It is a sweet story and totally believable.

A flight attendant, she has moved back home with her parents after transferring to their local airport. Returning home she finds it's not as it used to be. Her best friend, Jonathan, is no longer next door. His parents had moved to the Bahamas and Shelly had no idea where Jonathan ended up.Moving home and getting back together with her sister, Shelly is reminded of her times with Jonathan. He was her best friend growing up and eventually, her boyfriend. One important detail she remembers is the last time she saw him. This is the story of Shelly rediscovering herself, finding out who she really is, and what she really wants to do with her life. The airlines she is with is going under and her life is heading in a different direction. A beautiful piece of inspirational romance has Robin Jones Gunn come up with here.

There is a very nostalgic feel to this book that is different than the others in the Glenbrooke Series. I still love Robin Jones Gunn's books and am always thrilled to read - or reread - them!

One negative thought-I did feel like this book was a little slow. A little hard to get into. There were no big events, no mystery or real drama but it was still interesting and sweet and I am very glad I read it. ***This book was given to me by the publisher in exchange for an open and honest review***"}, {"userName": "Ellen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4426353-ellen", "userReview": "Once again I loved curling up with the characters in the Glenbrooke Series from Robin Jones Gunn. After turning down a marriage proposal from Jonathan, Shelly leaves home and enters into school to be a flight attendant. She learns the career she has chosen has left little time for God and other real relationships. When she learns her company is downsizing, she returns home hoping for a better schedule out of a smaller airport. Little did she know, God had other plans for her future. Shelly's life can be any one of ours. How many times do we run from situations only to realize the grass is not greener on the other side? Robin Jones Gunn does an amazing job at showing the importance of letting go our desire for control and letting God, in His perfect timing, take over our lives. Thanks for another great heart-warming story!I love this series and am looking forward to reading all of the books: (1) Secrets, (2) Whispers, (3) Echoes, (4) Sunsets, (5) Clouds, (6) Waterfalls, (7) Woodlands, and (8) Wildflowers.My rating: A+I received a complimentary ebook copy of Clouds from WaterBrook Multnomah and their Blogging for Books program for my honest review.

I don't know, maybe it's a personal thing, but to me \"Shelly\" just kinda rolls off the tongue in a great way. And I can't remember the last time read a book with the main character named \"Jonathan,\" so it was a really great pick. I really liked the way the plot played out. I have a personal love for books that take place--or have scenes--in foreign countries, especially when they let the culture show through. The better part of this book took place in Germany. I felt like the topic was interesting and a legitimate possibility, and it was interesting to watch as the characters handled it in their own ways. Lastly, I loved the cover! It's beautiful on the web, and even more gorgeous on the physical book! I loved this book. It had some really cute scenes, and I loved the way it ended. Definitely recommended! I received a free copy of this book from the publisher for this review.

Shelly Graham is finding it harder and harder to deal with the results of her choices.Shelly wanted to be a flight attendant and did so for five years. When she made her choice to leave, she hurt the person she loved very deeply, burying her feelings at the same time. Now she is coming home to a house that should be filled with love and life, but she finds no one to share it with. Then, she unexpectedly runs into Jonathon in Germany. It is difficult for her to handle the news that Jonathon is now engaged to someone else, but she works hard to keep that from him. She feels alone and empty confronting emotions she didn't know ran so deep. What can she do to bury the pain she feels now? How could she not have realized how much she cared about him? Will she be able to talk to Jonathon about the consequences of her earlier choices?\"Clouds\" is a book that will pull you into its pages through good writing, realistic characters, and a story line that will make you wonder how it will end. I really enjoyed it and will be going back to read the other four books in the series. I recommend it to readers who love a good story."}, {"userName": "Bethany", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20908058-bethany", "userReview": "Shelly and Jonathan were best friends as long as they can remember.

Eventually Shelly realizes her ideas and dreams weren't as fulfilling as they seemed from the distance.Years later she meets Jonathan by freak accident and tries desperately to start over where they left off but has it been too long? Are those feelings even really there anymore?I actually really liked this book, which surprised me a little bit because the last book I read by Robin Jones Gunn I thought was a little too childishly romantic. This story was actually quiet heartwarming! I thoroughly enjoyed it!This is definitely a great book for YA readers! The Biblical perspective on love and dating is really straightforward and to the point!I received this book free in exchange for an honest review!"}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5520847-jennifer", "userReview": "Even though this is number 5, this is the first of The Glenbrooke Series that I have read. I'm definitely going to read the other books now too! This was a quiet read and one filled with forgiveness, family and love, both of others and God. I felt it moved along and didn't get bogged down in details, but gave enough background information to grasp the bond of Shelly and Jonathan, while sharing how they would eventually find one another again. I enjoyed reading the middle which was set in Germany. Robin did a fantastic job with description! I've never been to Germany, but could picture the characters and imagine the scene outside St. Annakapella. I don't often have tears when reading, but did a few times; I was so engrossed in the story. Robin Jones Gunn is a gifted writer and shares such wonderful, heartfelt stories. I haven't read one yet that I didn't love.I received a free copy of this book from WaterBrook Multnomah for my honest opinion.

It is a quick, easy and fun read. I had to keep reminding myself that Shelly was only in her mid-twenties. Everyone around her has these amazing jobs so you can easily forget ages. I felt such naive and immaturity from her in some situations. There are times I just want to scream, \"What are you doing? Just say something!\" Assuming things just brings these characters more pain then they need. There were also so many coincidences that never would happen in reality. I thought that the book laid out the back story very well. The writing flowed seamlessly. However, in my opinion, the work to the climax happened too fast. There could have been more depth to the ending. It was too whimsy.Until next time, live life one page at a time!"}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2868865-rachel", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this sweet and amusing Christian romance. The characters were well drawn, and I liked the plot a lot. Also, I truly enjoyed seeing how the protagonist grew not only as a person but as a believer. Since I've read this volume of the series several times growing up, I'm rather nostalgic about this particular story about Shelly and Jonathan, and now I like it even more after having seen where the story fits into the series overall and knowing who some of the characters are better now that I've read their stories as well. Even though I think any of the books of this series could stand alone, I do see how the books do build on one another, so I would recommend reading the series in order if possible. Anyhow, this series is full of both great characters and great stories where character lessons and spiritual truths are interwoven with the fun plots."}], "description": "This bestselling former Palisades release is book five in the new Glenbrooke series by award-winning author Robin Jones Gunn.
