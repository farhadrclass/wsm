The contemporary short stories at the end of each chapter were really good, especially starting from Chapter 4 with \"Mule Killers\" by Lydia Peelle.The main focus of the book is literary fiction and is admittedly biased against genre fiction with a convincing reason: \"whereas writing literary fiction can teach you how to write good genre fiction, writing genre fiction does not teach you how to write good literary fiction.\" She further draws a comparison between realism and drawing of still life in painting, which analogy I found to be pretty compelling.There are limitations to the book, however. First, there are other books that cover certain topics much more in depth, such as characterization (see Swain's Techniques of the Selling Writer), point of view (see Orson Scott Card's Characters and Viewpoint), description (Monica Wood's Description), story and structure (James Scott Bell's Plot & Structure and Donald Maass's books), revision (Self-Editing for Fiction Writers), etc. Also, the students are left to find all the topics implemented in the short stories at the end of each chapter, and yet it's sometimes difficult to pinpoint why exactly those stories were selected. Some guidance on how those stories used the techniques discussed could have been beneficial.There are other shortcomings. In certain parts, the author also asks questions to the reader without providing answers, which is a shame because feedback is one of the most important factors in learning. The section on \"psychic distance\" was not entirely clear, especially the examples she gives to illustrate using abstract nouns and generic details increases a sense of distance while using concrete nouns and specific details increases intimacy.Another misguiding thing about the book is when it covers the \"golden\" rule of contemporary fiction: show and tell. She pretty much tells you, \"Show, don't tell,\" which is misleading because you should definitely show and tell where appropriate and simple vilification of telling does more damage than good, since telling can be a powerful tool, too, and she doesn't cover when it's good to tell and instead gives the false impression that telling is always bad--a preposterous stance if you stop and think about all those authors who use a hell of a lot of telling (Marquez, Chabon, Murakami) and still manage to be fascinating. She does, however, cover what makes good telling in a wholly different chapter under a different name: summary.Also, she covers some topic and doesn't tell us any rule of thumb for knowing when it's good to use it. For example, she says filtering should be avoided. But a lot of stories--even those included in the book--use filtering at some point. When is it okay to use any technique she cautions us against? Should we always avoid them? But why are the stories she herself selected use them? So some explanation on that aspect of each technique would have been illuminating.All in all, this is a really good book on writing, and I think everyone who is serious about the craft should read it.Good stuff."}, {"userName": "Dave Cullen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2370826-dave-cullen", "userReview": "This is THE classic how-to on writing fiction. I used this both as a student and teacher. The examples are incredible.Update, Aug 2017:I just bought the 8th edition of this book, and started rereading several chapters again. (I also went back and reread 10 years ago.) Even an experienced writer can really benefit from a quick refresher on techniques I've left behind. We each fall into our own writing ways, doing the stuff that has worked for us, and it's remarkable how many things I'm NOT taking advantage of. Or techniques that I spurned at another time, didn't feel right for me, but I'm in the right place for now.And exceptional book. A true gift for writers. Note: It's really expensive, but thank God for used books. I find that if you go back one edition, it's dramatically cheaper. The 9th edition is out, so I bought the 8th for $30. Still pricey for a paperback book, but this is unique, and a steal at that price. (And I imagine they have to pay very high fees for using all the short stories, and long excerpts.) So I'm not getting all the latest stories, but so what? They have changed dramatically from the last edition I got. And I don't really need new ones anyway.)"}, {"userName": "Steelwhisper", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7962895-steelwhisper", "userReview": "Unhelpful waffle."}, {"userName": "Kathleen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/891502-kathleen", "userReview": "\"Almost any reader can identify with almost any character; what no reader can identify with is confusion.\""}, {"userName": "Steven", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6158272-steven", "userReview": "I cannot in good conscience give this text anything higher than a two. The advice is solid, I'm not going to argue against that, but there is far too much meat in the writing that comes across less as solid writing advice and more as a formulaic approach to writing. This text is full of bland approaches to writing and repeats the same things I've read in other books. The exercises are tedious and boring; there is no sense of adventure or experimentation. It's a methodical, bland, autopsy of writing and what works, supposedly, in making writing better. If your goal is to understand the craft of writing, this is not the book for you. I recommend Jerome Stern's Making Shapely Fiction, Stephen King's On Writing, or The Truth of the Matter: Art and Craft in Creative Non-Fiction for the sake of actual method and practice material. This book is for you only if you're goal is to be a \"write by numbers\" kind of person. If you need the formula, if you need every single little aspect of writing to be laid bare for you, then read this. If you're purpose is to understand writing, well, you'll get that from this but it's a longer journey to take and can be done better and more succinctly via other paths.If you wish to be a good writer, well, write. That's the best advice anyone can (and will, in every writing guidebook) tell you. After that, read. Then, if you're lucky and have talent, you can be a successful writer. No formulaic approach will make you better than what you inherently are.

It provides students a grounding vocabulary. With this book students can discuss the elements of writing rather than rely on anecdote or discuss talent. As a student myself, I've been frustrated by authors and teachers explaining writing as a boundless art form that cannot be learned by a conventional curriculumWriting Fiction does not try to contain writing in a concrete definition, but the book makes creative writing possible to study and discuss with others.

In addition to in depth explanations of how to work with setting, characters, time, space plot and point of view; it offers many intriguing writing exercises and fun prompts. It's an excellent source of advice to any writer aspiring to be published, or even just if your creative writing is limited to your own entertainment. It offers methods to shape, enrich and enliven the stories by discussing, throughout the book, the main concerns with planning fiction, in its multiple aspects, going beyond outdated advice like Faulkner's \"kill all your darlings\".I was impressed by how the book really seemed to cover all possible realms of the writing process and loved Burroway's airy narration along it. One of my favorite textbooks by far!Favorite short stories:\"Bullet in the Brain\" by Tobias Wolff\"Reply All\" by Robin Hemley\u201cBinocular Vision\u201d by Edith Pearlman\u201cMud\u201d by Geoffrey Forsyth\"We Didn't\" by Stuart Dybek*\"Like a Pilll\" by Nicole Rivas"}, {"userName": "Nicole Pramik", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24437209-nicole-pramik", "userReview": "This is, without a doubt, probably the go-to textbook for college-level Creative Writing courses. Many years ago (I refuse to say how long), this was the text my professor used in his class. So the fact it has been in print for years is a testament to the longevity of its advice. Though there are pros and cons to this text, both for writers and professors/instructors.First the good stuff. Despite being a \"textbook,\" this book doesn't come across as a \"hard\" read. It's organized nicely with its topics divided into modestly-sized portions so it's easy to locate and read what you need. Likewise, the sample readings and exercises/prompts can be beneficial to those writing short fiction. (The same principles can certainly apply to writing novels but I sense most Creative Writing classes focus more on short stories for the sake of time.) Basically, if you read this book, you really don't need any other fiction writing text as they all essentially, though with some deviation, cover the same material, and fiction writing isn't an area/field that constantly changes. How to craft good dialogue, for instance, isn't going to change too much in terms of what makes good dialogue and what makes poor dialogue. Those methods are pretty much set without anything new to add. So if you own Writing Fiction then consider your fiction writing library essentially complete.That being said, this book does have some weak points that are worth mentioning. Once more, its focus seems to be on short fiction, primarily short stories (not micro-fiction, flash fiction, novelettes, or novellas). The same basic principles here would apply to longer or shorter fictional works, but the fact these forms aren't addressed in much detail does cause this book to be less than entirely comprehensive.Likewise, Writing Fiction does retain a certain subtle pretentious air that literary (or general) fiction is all that writers need to be exposed to and learn to write. I know from first-hand experience that college Creative Writing courses tend to discourage genre fiction, which comprises a far larger percentage of the overall fiction market. There is this underlying attitude - and this text does nothing to dispel this - that genre fiction (e.g. science fiction, fantasy, western, romance, etc.) is somehow sub-par and associated with the \"masses.\" Basically, it's the old high culture versus low culture debate, and Writing Fiction doesn't strive to make strides to encourage amends. So if you happen to write genre fiction (as do I), then you will not find anything here helpful in terms of writing and world-building within your genre nor will you see any attempts at peace being made between the high culture/low culture camps.Overall, I do think Writing Fiction is a good resource whether you are teaching a Creative Writing class or workshop or if you're a writer, regardless of genre. This book does have its bumps, particularly in not acknowledging genre fiction, but if you're looking for a general resource to help you get started with the nuts and bolts of writing, or if you just need a refresher, then this is a worthwhile pick."}, {"userName": "T.H.

With detailed chapters on the process of writing, showing vs. telling, and creating three-dimensional characters and settings, this may be the penultimate book for beginning writers. Even intermediate writers will find reminders about all the things we're doing wrong that we knew were wrong, but forgot we were doing. Filled with vivid examples to illustrate every lesson, the book even has a few things for more seasoned writers.New writers often have the hardest time grasping the concept of showing vs. telling, and this section in Writing Fiction is one of the best yet I've read, teaching the difference between the two with well-written examples perfectly re-written to ensure the lesson is learned. The section on characterization is exceptionally thorough, delving into great detail on what makes good characters and what makes great characters. All stories need good characters, but the best stories have great characters.With about one-third examples and writing exercises and two-thirds instruction, I firmly believe this is the first book every aspiring fiction writer should pick up and study.Bottom LineWriting Fiction is expensive, but worth every penny.

The craft essays at the beginning of each chapter are too in-depth and analytical for beginning fiction writers, I think. As a textbook, this be perfect for students coming in with more experience/skills. I certainly learned a lot, though, and I plan to use some of these terms and explanations of craft elements in relation to each other in future lectures. The contemporary short stories in here are absolutely wonderful, in particular \"Tandolfo the Great\" by Richard Bausch, \"Every Tongue Shall Confess\" by ZZ Packer, \"Gryphon\" by Charles Baxter, \"Winky\" by George Saunders, and \"Orientation\" by Daniel Orozco. And the essay \"Shitty First Drafts\" by Anne Lamont, which I first discovered here, will remain a mainstay in my curriculum. Seems to really break the ice at the beginning of the semester and introduce creative writing students to the ardorous process of draft/revision, no matter what the genre, in a humorous way.Oh, and the writing exercises are excellent.

Anyone outside of this demographic probably won't care or will grown bored. I fell into the latter group. While there were many kernals of good advice, it was all information I had heard before. Good reminders, perhaps; beyond that, it offered little more for me.Overall, this is a good textbook for the undergrad English major. I would suggest being cautious with the author's opinions, however. There are few things I despise more in English craft books than \"This is the way to do this and it is the only way\" which Burroway alludes to from time to time. Which is ironic considering that the first chapter is entitled \"Whatever It Takes\" and is the same chapter in which the author tells the reader to \"keep a journal,\" freewrite, and so forth.

I especially like Burroway's chapter on Story Form as an Inverted Check Mark. Here she talks about Freitag's famous pyramid of five actions and moves to how the \"story shape\" can work as an inverted check mark. She asks '\"where should your narrative begin?\" Her distinctions between 'story' and 'plot' are very precise. Need help with story conflict, crisis, and resolution?

I love how Burroway segues from specific suggestions to illustrative examples from literature to a unified, comprehensive and comprehendible theory of how fiction works. \"Although these are tricks that can be taught and learned, they partake of the essential nature of creativity, in which several elements are joined to produce not merely a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts, but a whole that is something altogether other. At the conception of an embryo or a short story, there occurs a conjunction of two unlike things, whether cells or ideas, that have never been joined before. Around this conjunction other cells, other ideas accumulate in a deliberate pattern. That pattern is the unique personality of the creature, and if the pattern does not cohere, it miscarries or is stillborn.\" 312Because I almost exclusively teach creative nonfiction, and because I write both fiction and creative nonfiction, I found myself looking through Burroway's observations about fiction to the fundamentals of good story-telling, and through craft to observations about our fundamental nature as created beings and as creators.

The instructional sections are a little dry and boring, but this is mainly because the level of detail in them. For example, Burroway goes through every single possibility for point of view or explain several metaphors for plot. The example stories in each chapter offer a great reward for getting through the instructional sections. They are well-written, diverse, and creative. They remind me why I want to write, and I think you could consider buying this book just for these collection of stories. The exercises will help you understand the concepts of the chapter, and some of them are pretty challenging. They will make you think.
