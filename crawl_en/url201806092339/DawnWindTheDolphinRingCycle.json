Okay, so I like descriptions, so that really wasn't the problem. I think it was the setting...I'm just not used to it and there needed to be a tad more dialogue. But still, I enjoyed the last 100 pages the best and I'm glad things ended happily, although it took long enough for it to happen! There were several parts I did enjoy, but it still was one of those books that I had no trouble setting aside after one chapter. Since I've heard other good things about this author I'm willing to give her another try."}, {"userName": "Brian", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/198932-brian", "userReview": "Dawn Wind is the fifth in the sequence of historical novels dealing with the collapse of Roman-Britain that began with The Eagle Of The Ninth. Set in the sixth century it tells the story of Owain, the sole British survivor of a battle near Bath and his struggle to come to terms with the complete destruction of his culture.As usual with Rosemary Sutcliff, there's a powerful sense of place, and of the changing face of the natural world. The writing is compact and masterful in its use of salient detail to evoke a vanished world. The central characters of Owain and Regina, the girl he befriends in the ruins of the once-proud city of Viroconium, are strongly drawn and the reader cannot help but be drawn into this compelling story of individual lives caught up in a great historical tide.This is historical fiction at its very best."}, {"userName": "Nikki ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nikki", "userReview": "Dawn Wind isn't my favourite of the series so far, but it is a lovely read, even though the British people that Sutcliff has written about up to this point in the series are dying out, even though the light that Artos and his men tried to protect is going out. It still focuses on British people, but more and more now the Saxon people are important, and given lives and feelings. I always half-expect Aquila's sister's son's family, from The Lantern Bearers, to somehow show up, with some story to hold onto about a dolphin ring... But not so far, at least. Still, a member of the family still carries the ring, for most of the story.It's a story about keeping faith, really, even between Britons and Saxons, but at the end, between Briton and Briton. It isn't exactly heart-warming -- separation by slavery isn't the stuff of Hallmark cards -- but it's touching, and effectively written."}, {"userName": "Morgan Dhu", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27667399-morgan-dhu", "userReview": "When I was young, I read all of the books written by Rosemary Sutcliff that I could find, but that was a very long time ago, and I do not remember if this novel, Dawn Wind, was among them. It is one of her young adult novels, and thus not a particularly challenging read, but it is still a solid historical novel, with a personable young hero and an interesting time to tell a story in. Roman Britain is almost gone, yielding to the incursions of Angles, Saxons and Jutes. Owain, a young British boy orphaned in battle, finds a young British girl, Regina, the survivor of a sacked Romano-British city. Together they try to escape to Gaul, but the girl falls ill, and to buy her a place in a household where she will be cared for, sells the only thing he has (other than his father's ring, which he buries rather than give it into Saxon hands) - his freedom. Sutcliff's account of Owain's life as a thrall among the Saxons gives light to the events and customs of the period, as he witnesses the rise to power of Aethelbert of Kent and the arrival of Augustine of Hippo in Britain. And there's a happy ending, too."}, {"userName": "Joy C.", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10371233-joy-c", "userReview": "Ah, I'll always love Sutcliff so much. She is such a good writer, and it doesn't get old saying how beautifully and understatedly powerful her writing is. \"Dawn Wind\" started a bit slow, and took me a good while to get through (especially in the first half), but I'm half inclined to think it was my fault because I've been in a bit of a reading slump. Nonetheless the last third of the book had a heightening of suspense, and the conflict felt real. It was a quiet novel, in many ways, but I learnt a lot from its history. I also love Owain's character - his faithful service and muted courage was my favourite thing! Sutcliff really knew how to write her male characters, I think :). Also I appreciated the reference to Augustine and the Christian Church in this story, and seemed to see a bit of the history playing out in ordinary characters.As always, Sutcliff's most powerful weapon is her use of description and understated power in the very ordinary moments. She does it amazingly!"}, {"userName": "Ariana", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3999129-ariana", "userReview": "The Dawn Wind is a fabulous book primarily because of the virtues of Owain, the main character. He gives away years of his life out of honor, even though his own desire is to return to a young girl he was forced to leave. The story begins with Owain waking up on a battlefield that he fought upon with his father, brothers, and his father's army, but he soon finds that no one else survived the battle except for one wounded war dog. This is my favorite book."}, {"userName": "Viola Sung", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31009784-viola-sung", "userReview": "\"Life is fierce and harsh to the young, but gentler when one grows old. Only while one is young there is always the hope that one day something will happen- that one day a little wind will rise...\"Precise, visual writing with words that alighted on my heart. The characters were vividly described and the story flowed naturally. Owain's encounters and his responses to them really resounded with me and the way they were portrayed have made this story a renarkable one.

The light of civilization has gone out, but there is a hint of new light on the horizon; the Saxons have defeated (most of) the Romano-British, but there is hope for a new civilization from the best of the Saxons and the remnants of the British. Interestingly, Owain (the narrator) explicitly considers and rejects Christianity as that light, or rather, he sees that Christianity is only part of it, not the whole. Once you get past the light and darkness metaphors, there is an absorbing story of loyalty and honor, of being alone and out of place in a strange world and having to find and maintain one's identity, of staying true to what is important, and of course of dogs and horses and a whole lot of scenery porn: basically, everything Sutcliff. Owain's thralldom recalled Aquila's in The Lantern Bearers, and as that was my least favorite part of that book, I was not as entranced by this as I might have been; or maybe it's just that I prefer the British to the Saxons.ETA: After starting another Sutcliff that is clearly more of What I Like, I'm scaling back my generous rating. I certainly liked this book, but to me it is not a 4-star book."}, {"userName": "SA", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3108367-sa", "userReview": "I'm reading these chronologically out of order, and it's a bit of adjustment to jump back and forth into these transitional periods of time in early (recorded) British history. This shows, basically, the establishment of the frontier of Wales that stayed effectively intact into modern British history. Sutcliff's thesis in this book was an investigation of the commingling of the settling Northern European groups with the remaining Romano-British peoples in the first few hundred years after Rome's withdrawal--and while that stated sounds dry, this is anything but. The real gift Sutcliff has is her ability to develop complex emotional interplay with great deftness and subtlety. The feelings her character Owain struggles with are as much individual as they are on a grand, state-level scale. I can't praise her enough. Additionally, I watched the two series \"A History of Ancient Britain\" and \"A History of Celtic Britain\" (http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00xchyf) last month, and while my appetite has been whet all my life for anglophilia, the coinciding of watching that amazing series with these amazing books has just completely captured my attention. This Dolphin Ring cycle will gain a permanent groove on my bookshelf, of that I'm certain."}, {"userName": "Marisa", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/956150-marisa", "userReview": "I absolutely loved this book!

It's worth reading, but more\u2014it's worth re-reading."}, {"userName": "Mary-Jean Harris", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5526063-mary-jean-harris", "userReview": "\"Not the dawn yet, but the dawn wind stirring\" This iconic quote from the book really sums up the story, and throughout the whole book, we see the \"little wind\", as Uncle Windreth tells the protagonist Owain, though we never quite reach the dawn. I found that throughout the book, I kept expecting something to happen, but I eventually (ok, in the last chapter) realized that no, it is the story of Owain's life (a chunk of it, at least) and there isn't some grand \"Thing\" that will happen. I'll get over with my complaints about the book first (why it didn't get 5 stars):The whole book is shrouded with an air of melancholy. It is a beautiful melancholy, but it isn't really an uplifting book. Actually, the air was similar to the Lord of the Rings. I liked it, but would have also liked a few more positive things too.The description was also overdone (ahem...not like I do that) and the description of battles and historical things often just went over my head. The book was supposed to be about Owain,and I became confused at times because it seemed to be focusing too much on the Saxons and the wars and things. Also near the end, the old Briton Einon Hen talks to Owain about the \"wind\" to do with the spread of Christianity, which Owain wasn't really a part of (the confusion was that I thought he would play a more major role in this). There were parallels with this and Owain's life, but I think more should have been focused on his own journey. Also, with regards to Owain's freedom, he keeps on wanting to get away from his duty at the Saxon home, but it has become his home, and he is too blind to see that he cares for the family there and they care for him, and when he finally does leave, it is just even more depressing, because he could have had a good life there. Yet that's also what is good about him too (now transitioning to the good things about the book). Owain is an amazing character to follow. He has an indomitable courage and a strong sense of wanting to be free. Yet as we see many times in the book, when he is a thrall and then not a thrall (but still bound to Beornwulf's household), he doesn't even know what he'll do when he's actually free. But it's a longing for something higher than what he has in life, and that is something that sets him apart from most of the other characters. This book is also a love story, but not a love story at the same time. I won't give away the end, but the way it was done was just perfect, and very subtle, so you almost didn't even know it was until the end.I felt like the plot needed more as I read it, but at the end when we come in full circle (you'll see if you read the book), I thought, \"No, this is good. No more is needed.\" And I also got that sort of \"Oh,\" feeling at the end; not \"Oh!\" or \"Oh?\" but just \"Oh, yes, that's it. It's over. But I'm changed from reading this.\" In a good way, I think, though much of that is to do with wondering about what is to come, with Owain's life and with the Britons and Saxons. We're stirring in the dawn, and it only just breaks at the end of the book.There were also many absolutely beautiful and haunting descriptions such as this one: \"faint wraiths of mist lay across the levels, the thorn trees rising knee-deep out of them, but overhead the sky was clear, and the young moon floated like a curved feather above the woods.\"There are so many beautiful scenes, such as when the Saxon King Haegal gives his sword to be burned with the body of his friend Beornwulf, and Owain later sees him with a commoner's sword. You really have to read it to get the impact of this though.So I would recommend this book to people to people who like beautifully written historical books that make you think, but aren't heavy on the plot."}, {"userName": "Sadie Slater", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53706128-sadie-slater", "userReview": "Rosemary Sutcliff's Dawn Wind is full of the tropes of YA postapocalyptic fiction. It opens with the 14-year-old protagonist waking up to the realisation that everyone he ever knew is dead and he is all alone in the world; later, he and a girl he meets eke out a living in the burnt-out and deserted ruins of their home city, foraging for food and having to avoid lawless bands of armed men. So far, so standard; but the difference here is that the book begins in around 680AD, and is historical fiction, not science fiction, and the world that has ended is the last relic of Romanised Britain, crushed by the Saxons in the battle that takes place just before the story begins. Somehow this was the book Station Eleven most reminded me of, and made me want to re-read. It's also a hopeful book, as Owain serves out the years first as thrall and then as trusted retainer to a Saxon family and sees the beginnings of co-operation between Saxons and the British remaining in Wales; the \"dawn wind\" of the title beginning to blow after the dark century when the remains of the Roman civilisation were slowly destroyed by the invaders.Dawn Wind isn't my favourite Sutcliff; that will always be Frontier Wolf, and more generally I much prefer the novels set in Roman Britain. The Saxon Britain of Dawn Wind is a much poorer place, a land of isolated farms in clearings in the woods, each settlement much more cut off from its neighbours than the Roman towns, as the roads crumble away and groups of bandits roam the land. It's a sad book; there's a real sense of how much has been irrecoverably lost. In the light of Recent Events, I got a bit teary at this bit:For the space of two men's lives at least, we have stood alone, we in Britain, cut off from all that Rome once stood for, from all that we thought worth dying for. And today we have joined hands with those days of the Long Wandering [...] - a light clasp yet, and easily broken, but surely it will strengthen. [...] Not the dawn as yet, [...] but I think the dawn wind stirring.Actually, I got a bit teary at quite a few bits. It's not an easy read, but I found it very rewarding this time round; I think it's probably one of Sutcliff's less well-known books, and that's a shame, as it deserves a wider audience."}, {"userName": "Oreotalpa", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3293375-oreotalpa", "userReview": "I have three tiers of Sutcliff novels: those which I love to distraction (*****), those I love (****), and those which I enjoy (***). (We won't talk about Warrior Scarlet).This falls into the second category. The protagonist didn't draw me in as with some of the others, and I'm not as madly in love with the setting and premise as I am for \"Frontier Wolf\" or \"Blood Feud,\" but I deeply enjoyed it, and Owain's love interest Regina is one of the most interesting (and least queenly and dignified) Sutcliff women. Alas for my likelihood of loving the book to distraction, she was mostly offscreen.But it's probably the most nuanced treatment I've seen Sutcliff give both Saxons and organized religion, and worth reading for that alone. The antagonist is oddly fascinating, in a frustratingly unresolved way. And I did like Owain and care about his situation, although not to the degree I do my favorites.On the less positive side, there's not much action, less nature porn than I'd like, Owain's situation as a Saxon thrall is rather stifling in a quietly soul-killing way and not my favorite thing to read about, and Regina spends the majority of the book offscreen, likely being more interesting than Owain, but we'll never know because Sutcliff generally didn't find women as interesting to write about."}, {"userName": "Sineala", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7372963-sineala", "userReview": "An interesting read, but not my favorite Sutcliff book -- though I am still glad I read it. This is the tale of Owain, the only British survivor of a battle with the Saxons, and at first his dog Dog (also a battle survivor). He makes his way to ruined Viroconium where he meets Regina, the only person still living there. They plot to head to Gaul, but Regina sickens... and Owain sells himself into Saxon thralldom to get the Saxons to take care of her.The portrayal of both Saxons and slavery is more complex than in some of Sutcliff's other work. Saxons are people too, and thralldom isn't necessarily entirely bad. And eventually, we learn when Augustine of Canterbury shows up, Christianity is going to bring dawn to all of Britain -- though the treatment of Christianity is a little... strange, in a way I find difficult to describe. None of the characters seem particularly glad about it.I really enjoyed the Owain/Regina relationship, and of the Sutcliff novels I've read recently, this is one of the few with a completely positive happy ending. I mean, sure, there's some animal harm and of course characters die, but this is Sutcliff.Again, not my favorite, but still recommended."}, {"userName": "Meredith", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1560497-meredith", "userReview": "If fairy tales were historically accurate, they would read like Dawn Wind. Once upon a time during the Saxon conquest of Britain, there was a boy named Owain who, along with a war hound, was the sole survivor of the battle of Aquae Sulis. While searching for any remnant of the British host, he discovers a young girl, Regina, alone in a sacked and ruined city. As they attempt to escape to the safety of the British settlement in Gaul, Regina falls deathly ill, and Owain's only hope of saving her is a nearby Saxon homestead. The Saxons agree to care for her, but in return they sell Owain into slavery. This is Owain's story and his journey through darkness to find hope on the dawn wind.The writing is languid and poetic without being flowery.

I can't picture either with his brooding, intricate linework and heavy eyed, wiry figures.Sutcliff's children, almost uniquely in my experience, live adult lives and actually grow up to become adults without ever losing their character as children. I read these books as a kid, I am rereading them now as an adult, and they are just as enjoyable now as they were then.
