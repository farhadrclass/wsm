Their daughter left home for Haight Ashbury he seventies and hasn't been seen again, their son, the villain of the piece only wants what he feels he is owed. Tenants came and went, until the last several years when the group of residents have stayed the same. A disparate group of people, all seeking a shelter from their lives, a group of wonderful people with problems of their own. Edith now provided shelter and succor to this group of people with very real needs. Until Edith has problems of her own, memory loss, confusion and now Edith needs help herself.It is the people in this novel that draws one in and grab hold , not to let go until the very end. I came to know and love all these characters as if they were actual people in my very real life. So wanted things to work out for them.Poignant, yet at times humorous, amazing writing, this novel slowly sneaks up on the reader. A novel of families, the ones we make and the ones that are given us. Friendship, putting everything on the line to help other people. Home and what the term really means. Sometimes the home and family doesn't come to us, we must go and find it. A big sigh at the end of this book, I am so very glad to have met these characters.

Over several years, this group has formed within their abode, tight connections whose strength comes to the fore when the nucleus, landlord Edith, starts slowly descending into the mists of dementia. Thomas, the artist and recent stroke victim, who no longer feels any creative impetus; he will begin the most unlikely relationship with Adeleine, the agoraphobic who has made herself a world she can exist in inside her apartment, crammed full of vintage memorabilia; Edward, the cynical and no longer funny stand-up comedian, who can only see his life and past relationship now as failure; he will by some strange turn of fate become friend to Paul who suffers from Williams Syndrome, a neurological disorder characterized by his elfin facial appearance, his cheerful demeanour and ease with strangers, he is developmentally delayed, has strong language skills and a heightened affinity to music; Paul\u2019s sister Claudia lived nearby but has recently left her husband and taken to sleeping on Paul\u2019s couch after an episode landed him in hospital. All these tenants, who have formed unexpected relationships with their co-tenants and with Edith, will be shocked when Owen, their landlord\u2019s estranged son steps into the picture. His aim is to have Edith consigned to a nursing home and take over ownership of the place that the tenants have all realized signifies home is truly where the heart is.Alcott paints an eye-catching portrait that warmed my heart, made me laugh and at times gave me a lump in my throat. Rich and intricately character driven, it is beautifully written and eloquent and it does not fail to appeal with each new chapter. These tenants will become people who are very real and one cannot help but continue to think of them long after the novel is finished. Alcott\u2019s second novel deserves nothing less than 4.5\u2605 rating."}, {"userName": "Zoeytron", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12656534-zoeytron", "userReview": "'How do you tell someone her life has become too much for her?'Renters in a Brooklyn brownstone.

It's also a book about finding strength where we didn't know we had it, and the different ways we adapt to and cope with change.Edith has been the landlord of a Brooklyn apartment building for years, since she and her late husband Declan bought it. The building was home to some of her greatest joys and some of her greatest sorrows and regrets. She is a model landlady, caring for and nurturing her tenants, knowing when they are in need and knowing just what to give them, although she can't solve all of their problems. Her tenants are a group of troubled but giving people\u2014Thomas, a successful artist whose life is turned upside down after a stroke leaves one of his arms paralyzed; Adeleine, whose obsession with antique objects helps her build a home she never wants to leave; Edward, once a popular comedian, whose childhood has scarred him emotionally; and the amazing, childlike, loving Paulie, whose sister Claudia fulfills her parents' wish that her brother be taken care of appropriately.When Edith's mental and physical condition weakens, her estranged son returns home to claim the building and wants to evict all of her tenants. As they try to navigate the thoughts of their future, they each must confront challenges and determine what is next for them. But this will require courage, strength, even going beyond their comfort zones.I absolutely loved this book. It's told in very short chapters, but Alcott's use of language and imagery made me literally sigh and gasp at times. There was one point that I worried she was going to take the book down a path I absolutely dreaded, but she resolved that thread quickly and to my satisfaction, differently than I expected. This is a memorable book, both for how it is told and the characters on whom she focuses, many of whom will stick in your brains and your hearts as they did mine.See all of my reviews at http://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blo...."}, {"userName": "Cheri", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106692-cheri", "userReview": "Edith, the kind-hearted widowed landlady who can\u2019t seem to recall where her errant husband, Declan, has gone off to or when he will return. Paulie, a man in his mid-thirties with William\u2019s Syndrome, his sister Claudia who struggles with taking care of her brother, Claudia along with Edward, a comic who dislikes almost everyone and everything.Adeleine, beautiful but overwhelmed by the world outside her door. Thomas, a successful artist who struggles with the limitations a recent stroke has brought to his life.These are the people who live in Edith\u2019s apartment complex; a place that has been home to Edith since the day she and Declan first bought this Brooklyn brownstone. Almost every memory of hers is attached to this home, her mind going between the here and now and the past that refuses to stay there. The tenants have lived there seemingly forever. Each is broken in some way, emotionally, spiritually, physically. Between them, they somehow manage to make accommodations for each others missing pieces and together come up with a whole solution and ultimately a whole, if makeshift, family. Until Owen. Owen is Edith\u2019s son, who feels entitled to the brownstone. Owen can\u2019t wait to toss each of the tenants to the curb, with marginally kinder plans for his mother. Owen threatens the security, love, self-worth, everything they have found in this ramshackle family. Edith\u2019s decline prevents her from addressing the problem, let alone thinking of a solution, but they can\u2019t all just sit by and let this happen, or can they? Their actions come out of their desire to protect Edith as much as a desperate wish to avoid their fears associated with moving. Throughout their years with Edith, she has always taken care of them when needed; they have always cared for each other. Can they summon the courage and strength to overcome their obstacles and work together and rescue them all from Owen\u2019s plan? Despite the \u201cnegative\u201d of keeping track of multiple characters that hop around in segments/chapters almost as if they had a life of their own, Infinite Home is a lovely story filled with charmingly endearing, quirky characters who I grew to love. Be prepared to take some time to get to know each and every one, and enjoy life in this Brooklyn brownstone."}, {"userName": "Claudiapiepenburg", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44046350-claudiapiepenburg", "userReview": "I so so want to like this book. I'm now half-way through and still want to like it. But I have this urge to take my highlighter and start accentuating every simile and metaphor and that Ms. Alcott uses, and tonight I came to the realization that if I do that, every page will be filled with color. The story is an intriguing one, and I've fallen in love with some of the characters (which is the only reason I will finish the book) but she is trying way too hard to show all of us that she's a WRITER!!!!! I'm a writer who can come up with 10,000 ways to describe the simple act of putting something on the stove or walking down the street. 10,000 ways to compare it to something else that, when you think about it for even a very short while, there's really no comparison at all. Does every action have to be compared to another? I wish I had a dollar for every time Ms. Alcott uses the word \"as.\" She needs to exorcise that word from her vocabulary. Example: \"These things are delicious,\" she exclaimed, waving the biscuits as though trying to keep the attention of a baby. Why? Why did you write that? We get it, she waved the biscuits. Enough already, leave it at that.

To illustrate what I mean by overwritten, below is the first chapter in its entirety (all the chapters are short). This writing style can be beautiful when used sparingly but is over the top when it flows continuously.THE NEIGHBORS HADN\u2019T NOTICED the building\u2019s slow emptying, didn\u2019t register the change until autumn\u2019s lavish colors arrived and leaves sailed through the windows the man hadn\u2019t bothered to shut.

Some nights his seat remained empty, and yellows and whites and golds briefly filled each room before darkening and appearing in the next, the lights traveling from the first floor to the third, and the movement of electricity was a quiet spectacle, like the reappearance of hunger after a long illness.When the cold knock of air came and New York turned white, he closed the windows.-------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: \u201cAging gracefully\u201d was a model much talked about, though Edith doubted anyone ever felt elegant or nimble amid the nearly inescapable fatigue, the persistent mutations of once-simple tasks and the shame thereafter.First Sentence: The neighbors hadn\u2019t noticed the building\u2019s slow emptying, didn\u2019t register the change until autumn\u2019s lavish colors arrived and leaves sailed through the windows the man hadn\u2019t bothered to shut."}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2228181-jill", "userReview": "Once, when I was getting ready for a move, a friend said, \u201cRemember, home is nothing more than a piece of real estate.\u201d But I knew then \u2013 and I know now \u2013 that it is really much more. Home is the place where you are your most authentic self, a place of sanctuary and acceptance.Kathleen Alcott wisely understands that. In a run-down Brooklyn brownstone, overseen by an octogenarian named Edith who is beginning to lose her mind, a ragtag small group of men and women feel anxious for their future. All are damaged, physically or emotionally: Thomas, a once-time well-known painter who is now partially paralyzed by a stroke, Paulie, a child-man who suffers from Williams Syndrome and his tightly-coiled and doting sister Claudia, Adeleine who is an agoraphobe and hoarder, and Edward, a comedian who hides his fears with caustic humor. Together, they recreate the definition of family and learn to trust and love each other.This author\u2019s prose is gorgeous \u2013 sometimes, breathtakingly so, and her insights are similarly beautiful. One description of Edith: \u201cShe was upset because she said (her memories) were sort of losing their foundation, like they were flooded and pushed into the wrong rooms.\u201d There is the fear of \u201cplaying nonsensical checkers with incontinent zombies.\u201d Or, in this description of fireflies: \u201cThey had seen only little flashes like the beginnings of lonely ideas but not the crowd of busy angels he had come for.\u201d After a little while, I began noting that every single chapter could actually stand by itself as a short story, although this is definitely a novel with a forward propulsion. Each of thse chapters shimmers like gems.And oh, the themes: what is home? (One character answers, \u201cNo need to bring home with me, dear. I know what it feels like.\u201d) What happens when we are forced out of our own poor facsimile of a self-created Garden of Eden into the world to seek answers? Can we recreate ourselves to give ourselves a second chance \u2013 through trust of others, the open road, cults, or the great outdoors? The answers are nuanced: some of these characters can, some can\u2019t. I would give this novel 5 stars were it not for one particularly one-dimensional character. Owen, Edith\u2019s son, is the embodiment of menacing evil, and the reasons for his malaise are way too pat. Also, Claudia\u2019s devotion to her brother Paulie sometimes seems idealized and cloying. Still, with those exceptions, this is a fine book with mesmerizing prose that fully addresses how and why a life is worth living."}, {"userName": "Emily M", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8112372-emily-m", "userReview": "Kathleen Alcott is a tremendous writer, and she delivers extremely strong prose here.

But as she ages, she fails to notice a defined group forming in her halls and settling down for good: Eddie, a lonely, washed-up comic; Paulie, a tender-hearted young man with Williams syndrome; Thomas, an artist adjusting to life after a stroke; and Adeleine, an anxious and reclusive young woman. Over time, the four tenants discover their unique connections, both to each other and Edith, just as the stability of their home is threatened.Infinite Home is an absolute wonder. Kathleen Alcott knows how to weave words into sentences so lovely they often cause pause and demand a re-read. But the novel doesn\u2019t hinge only on her gorgeous writing\u2014she spins her words into the intricacies of characters, creating fully realized, unique personalities from the smallest details.The novel\u2019s plot moves forward with many shifting, sometimes nonsensical, pieces that require some suspension of disbelief, but Alcott makes this easy with the hazy, nearly dreamlike world she creates for her characters. Though their lives are far from perfect, Alcott lifts them up to shed light on the beauty of change, challenge, and imperfection. Wonderfully balanced between sweet and sentimental, with both weight and whimsy, Infinite Home is easily a new favorite for 2015.More at rivercityreading.com"}, {"userName": "Book Riot Community", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33447134-book-riot-community", "userReview": "Now in paperback: A group of unusual tenants in a Brooklyn brownstone have been living quiet lives together, each dealing with their own problems and pains, but when their kind elderly landlord\u2019s mental capacity begins to weaken, the tenants are faced with eviction when her greedy estranged son takes over the building.

Alcott has a great way of showing how all of us are just holding it together and once it starts to leak out we are in trouble. Most of this novel reminds me of the David Foster Wallace quote about how we are all so busy hiding our own issues that we don't notice any others and that if simply asked what is wrong we will erupt into a ball of chaos. Alcott's crazies all live in a small apartment building owned by Edith in NYC. They are long term tenants and rely on each other to share the burden of their issues. During the course of the novel, things come to a head as Edith lapses into old age dementia and her son Owen begins to think about remodeling and evicting the tenants. I really thought the forced plot was rather Disney (something about Owen reminded me of Cruella d'Vill from 101 Dalmatians) and unbelievable that he would hold Adelaine hostage in her own apartment and destroy things (even though he knew that she was weak and would not escape or call the police he had to anticipate that eventually Thomas would come back and that the police would be called; landlords CANNOT do what he did). Ultimately, I think the story was best before Thomas went off to CA; it really didn't need the plot movement. Alcott has a great way with words; she is very concise, but her turns of phrase manage to convey a lot. A few of my favorites were: \"Of course she loved her children--this was never in doubt--but when they became, more and more, the people they were, Edith felt as though nothing she could have done would have made any difference.\"\"The kid's brain was broken, but Edward couldn't of course recommend the health of his own. Paulie, it was clear, chased and cornered happiness daily.\"\"She dreamt, like a dog, kicking often\"\"The conversation came back to him like an infection, worse and larger in its return\"I liked Proximity to Alphabets better; thought the plot was better and more thought out (again, this didn't NEED the plot that Alcott forced upon it), but overall certainly a good, solid read."}, {"userName": "John Naylor", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15654295-john-naylor", "userReview": "I received this book for free via Goodreads First Reads.It took me a while to decide on a 2 star rating for this book.

There are a lot of positive things about this book and a few things I enjoyed.I just feel it was overwritten, slow and the plot was weak at times. As much as I enjoyed the writing I think it could have been cut by a third and told the same story. I like an author to find their voice and to use a lot of words as a rule but in this book it felt like nearly every page was made up of extra words that were not always needed.

On the other hand, Kathleen Alcott strives to make every sentence unique and poetic. Although I appreciated this craft, I did find myself tiring of it a bit as the novel progressed. She does create wonderfully drawn characters, each with some problem or disability: an aged woman who is becoming senile, a beautiful young woman who is bipolar and extremely agoraphobic, an artist who has had a stroke, a young man with a disability called Williams Syndrome which causes him to act very immature. These flawed individuals all come together in a Brooklyn brownstone where they are tenants of the sweet, dotty matriarch Edith. The chapters are all very short and skip around from character to character.

It felt like the parting smile of a hospice patient, leaving you sad, hopeful, and questioning.I can't tell if I've been swindled into accepting half baked archetypes though. There were plenty times where the book have easily fallen into hackneyed tripe. My own sentimentalism of moving into an apartment by myself more than likely filled in the missing gaps. It was a good book for me at this point in my life."}, {"userName": "Andrea MacPherson", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2025163-andrea-macpherson", "userReview": "A novel in short vignettes, about the lives of all the renters in a brownstone. Much to enjoy, but a few storylines that felt unnecessary and melodramatic (specifically Edith's two-dimensional son, and the implausible failed search for her daughter). Each of the characters is damaged in their own way--body impaired after stroke, agoraphobia, Williams Syndrome, dementia. While they each work individually, it also felt like too much in one place. Alcott has lovely writing, and the ability to create layered characters."}, {"userName": "Zoe Hall", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34708201-zoe-hall", "userReview": "I received this book as a result of winning a Goodreads giveaway so thank you very much for sending me a copy of this book.Now what can I say about this book? I really, really wanted to love this book. It'd been on my TBR list for a while so of course I was very excited when I saw I'd won a copy. However, and please don't take this the wrong way, but I just didn't enjoy this book as much as I was expecting. I only really cared for Edith. I actually found myself skimming pages and even whole chapters which I really hate doing but some of the narrative just didn't quite hold my interest.Having said that... The writing in this book is sublime, in fact the prose is wonderful and it's this that kept me reading to the end.All in all, I don't think this book was for me but Alcott's writing is beautiful in places so that's worth a read in itself. 3 stars."}, {"userName": "Drew", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3679784-drew", "userReview": "Alcott's characters are beautifully drawn and their plight, so simple and ordinary and yet given urgency for those very reasons, makes it easy to become an honorary member of this apartment building's \"family.\" The novel takes a few minutes to find its footing (the opening page-long prologue is not a great introduction) but almost before you know it, you are drawn into the quiet near-melancholy of this fading moment and propelled along to the equally quiet near-joy of the next moment's birth. A beautiful novel (with, by the way, a BEAUTIFUL jacket; the pictures don't do the colors justice) and a heartfelt depiction of the homes we create for ourselves - and the lengths that we will go to protect them, no matter what shape they take.More soon at RB:"}, {"userName": "Dennis Jacob Rosenfeld", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4609269-dennis-jacob-rosenfeld", "userReview": "Infinite Home revolves around the spaces we carve into the world and call home. About how they reflect our personalities and take shape accordingly, but also how they might end up shaping us. They can provide comfort as well as turn into prison cells. They may shelter us only shortly or for many years. A beautiful book with quite wonderful prose and descriptions of human nature that struck a chord deep within me."}], "description": "A beautifully wrought story of an ad hoc family and the crisis they must overcome together. Edith is a widowed landlady who rents apartments in her Brooklyn brownstone to an unlikely collection of humans, all deeply in need of shelter. Crippled in various ways\u2014in spirit, in mind, in body, in heart\u2014the renters struggle to navigate daily existence, and soon come to realize that Edith\u2019s deteriorating mind, and the menacing presence of her estranged, unscrupulous son, Owen, is the greatest challenge they must confront together. Faced with eviction by Owen and his designs on the building, the tenants\u2014Paulie, an unusually disabled man and his burdened sister, Claudia; Edward, a misanthropic stand-up comic; Adeleine, a beautiful agoraphobe; Thomas, a young artist recovering from a stroke\u2014must find in one another what the world has not yet offered or has taken from them: family, respite, security, worth, love. The threat to their home scatters them far from where they\u2019ve begun, to an ascetic commune in Northern California, the motel rooms of depressed middle America, and a stunning natural phenomenon in Tennessee, endangering their lives and their visions of themselves along the way. With humanity, humor, grace, and striking prose, Kathleen Alcott portrays these unforgettable characters in their search for connection, for a life worth living, for home.", "title": "Infinite Home", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24611962-infinite-home", "average": 3.59, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1429627924l/24611962.jpg", "reviews": 347, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5399365.Kathleen_Alcott", "name": "Kathleen Alcott"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Contemporary", "Literary Fiction", "New York"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24611962-infinite-home", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25502604-infinite-home", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29662086-infinite-home", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26052228-infinite-home", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25609369-infinite-home", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13263533-the-dangers-of-proximal-alphabets", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34696063-six-shorts-2017", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40220855-america-was-hard-to-find", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31685642-america-was-hard-to-find", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26017737-infinite-home-excerpt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
