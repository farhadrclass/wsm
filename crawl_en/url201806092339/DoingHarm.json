Kelly Parsons, a board-certified urologist has proven himself worthy to join this team. Parson's medical knowledge is apparent from the get-go as he explains treatments and procedure like any good doctor should.Stephen Mitchell, Chief Resident at prestigious Boston University gets caught up in a medical nightmare when one patient goes south and a botched surgery has horrid results. To complicate his quest for a permanent spot at Boston U, he begins an affair with a smart, seductive intern under his watch. But playing footsies is not all this temptress wants from Steve. She challenges him to a game where if he wins someone lives, if he loses, well, they're dead. Cat and mouse, mouse and cat; believable; enough to keep me breathless. Some small quibbles with dialog between characters. Things like Doctor Steve using the phrase \"you guys\" and \"jazzed\" but that could just be me. I do know this is a solid beginning to what I hope is a new or dual career for Kelly Parsons. BTW, Kelly is a guy in case you were wondering. Doing Harm is a heart pumping medical thriller pairing a \"do the right thing\" doctor and a psychotic intern. It's one of the best life or death races in hospital corridors I've read since Cook's Coma."}, {"userName": "Judy Collins", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11063006-judy-collins", "userReview": "Kelly Parsons' DOING HARM,  a medical thriller, which kept me listening, on the edge of my seat, until the Epilogue and closing interview, with the author. A gripping debut for a major fiction career for Parsons! The audiobook narrator, Robert Petkoff,  was a solid reader with a soothing voice, and his performance of some of the patients - a total riot with his sarcastic tones and character private thoughts. Would highly recommend the audiobook, as a narrator can make or break a book, and in this case, Petkoff was on the mark. Kelly Parsons,  a board certified urologist definitely knows the medical jargon, and apparently gets the writer and mystery thriller diagnosis on the money, with DOING HARM. Will keep you second guessing hospitals and doctors, for sure. The main character,  Dr. Steve Mitchell,  a senior surgical resident at a prestigious Boston University Hospital loves power and control, is ambitious, cocky, and as most residents, overworked and sleep deprived. He is married to a smart and intelligent wife, Sally, who gave up her high-powered job to stay home with the two young daughters, and finds out she is pregnant soon after the book begins. Two strong powerful  women characters - protagonist (Sally) and antagonist (Gigi) \u2013both interacting with the main character Steve, who finds himself in the middle of a nightmare from hell, and is unsure how to escape and save his reputation and family.With an array  of medical complications, botched surgery and deaths coming one after another \u2013 all pointing towards him, the competent and powerful doctor begins to second-guess himself, especially with the lethal dosage of potassium, which seems to be ordered by no other than himself. As his patients begin dying, Steve realizes that the deaths are not accidents, and he has to stop the deaths before his professional future is irrevocably destroyed\u2026but he can\u2019t tell anyone what is happening without risking both his career and his family.Worn down, Steve has a one-time affair before he realizes she is a dangerous femme fatale intern, sociopath, with a vindictive and psychotic plan to further her career, holding all the cards with an extensive blackmail scheme, involving, even more, deaths. Steve does not know whom to trust.  The stakes are high, adrenaline rush kicking in, fear, and mystery. She challenges him to a game,where if he wins someone lives if he loses, well, they're dead. Steve is aware he is being set up by this cold-blooded psychopath who is forcing him to play a game of cat and mouse (even though he hates cats), strategy before they kill another patient.LOVED the funny and sarcastic brilliant lines of Steve\u2019s thoughts throughout the book, keeping me laughing through all the intense scenes. I can only image doctors\u2019 thoughts about patients and their families. With Steve\u2019s undergraduate degree in computer science and hacking, came in handy with his hunt to nail this crazy intern, along with his partner in crime, Louise, and his intriguing background. The plot was well developed,  full of suspense, action packed, realistic, page-turning, and fascinating medical terms explained, and character development was right on. An accurate behind the scenes of a hospital, where doctors hold your life in their hands \u2013 no wonder they are on a power trip. Makes you wonder what is in the IVs and if you can trust anyone in the medical field \u2013 surgeries \"gone wrong\" \u2013 wonder why? Keeps you guessing . . . hope there is a sequel. With the insights  into the real world of doctors and hospitals, Kelly definitely gave this thriller life, with all the ingredients for a successful career as a mystery medical thriller author (dual career), as good as James Patterson, and the best of the best -- one I plan on following.Check out:  Under the Knife , Coming Feb 7, 2017.

In fact I would call it the best medical thriller I've read since Robin Cook in his Coma days and that's going back a bit.The premise involves surgeon Steve Mitchell who is seen as an excellent doctor looking forward to an outstanding future. But a bad call in judgement threatens his career. When one of his patients dies after what seems to be another bad call he starts to question the facts and finds out that someone else may be responsible. What follows is a suspenseful cat and mouse game that may destroy his career and family not to mention his life.That's all you need to know. There are plenty of tense moments and nice surprises. One of the non-surprises is who did it. We get plenty of clues at first and find out early on who the culprit is. Yet this is not meant to be a whodunnit. The tension is in whether our hero can clear himself and expose the killer. Parsons has made his protagonist flawed but admirable and his nemesis evil but frighteningly clever. The author does an excellent job blending his medical knowledge with the action. A little pharmaceutical knowledge might be helpful to the reader but not essential as Parson explain the more technical aspects in a way that doesn't stop the flow of the novel. One of the things I find essential in a good medical thriller is that the author writes about doctors and hospitals in a realistic way and this is no problem for Parson. A realistic environment combined with edge of your seat suspense is what makes this an excellent example of the thriller sub-genre.This book is being published in late January of 2014 so I can't call it one of the best novels of this year. But I do feel fairly safe in saying it will be a prime contender next year."}, {"userName": "Mary Beth", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4498175-mary-beth", "userReview": "This book was a 2.5 star book. I was so excited to read it because of description and the great reviews I saw. But it was sooo much medical jargon. The author did a good job of explaining everything, but it was zzzz. Also, it was fairly obvious from the beginning that the killer was GG, so I was relieved/annoyed when it was revealed to be her about 1/3 through. Then her whole reasoning for killing was sort of ridiculous and random. There was also the random element of the medical trial the doctors were participating in, which I hoped would have something to do with the plot, but was just a way for Steve to inject GG at the end... what!?Also, Steve's judgment was insane the entire time. He was completely annoying and incompetent, and very little of that could be blamed on GG. The fact that at the end he still scored this prestigious job was pretty lame.As an aside, I feel like the author should really do some self-reflection on his perceptions of women. The female characters in the book were either pushy/not super attractive (Sally), hot psychos (GG), or cold, repressed women (snobby Doctor's wife who practiced law). That may have been the most disturbing part of the book!"}, {"userName": "Esil", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil", "userReview": "I won this book on Goodreads, and it was generally a good read as far as mystery/thrillers go. Although for me the best part was actually the view of how hospitals work and surgeons function. It felt real and had interesting details. The plot itself was a bit too predictable and straight forward as far as mysteries go. Having said that, I would happily read another book by Parsons, and hopefully he will use his knowledge and talent to build a more sophisticated plot."}, {"userName": "Andrea \u2764Ninja Bunneh\u2764", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7897213-andrea-ninja-bunneh", "userReview": "Once upon a time, I was a Robin Cook junkie. I loved psychological thrillers, but give me a medical thriller and it was like getting candy on Halloween. When I saw Doing Harm on NetGalley, the junkie woke up and hit the request button. Dr. Steve Mitchell is a 4th year surgical resident in a prestigious hospital. His ego is inflated to the size most physicians never attain. Why that is I have absolutely no idea. Yes, he's the chief resident but, he is still just a resident. Residents are put on earth to do the bidding of the attending. They are the minions, if you will, the ones who do all the crap work that the attendings don't want to do. Eventually, the residents will become attendings and have their own residents to boss around. But, until then, a resident is just a resident. In that regard, Steve's hugely inflated God complex makes absolutely no sense. Period.Add to the ego, Steve (whom I renamed Dr. McDouchie), is a total asshole and a half. He cares nothing for his patients, has the compassion and bedside manner of a flea. That's actually an insult to the flea. His only concern is himself and how things affect him and his career. I would sooner have Steve Martin do surgery on me.\nAnd he plays a dentist.Basically, Dr. McDouchie has not one redeeming quality. Not one. I kept waiting, hoping that with all the events occurring he would become more human and likable. Nope. I hated his character. When you despise the main character you're supposed to feel sympathetic towards, the book goes out the window. And there it went for me.\nThere is one other main character in the book. The psycho who decides to torment Dr. McDouchie and destroy his professional and personal life. Why this person became an absolute psychopath, I have zero idea. We are not given any background whatsoever to that effect. We are, however, given massive amounts of info-dumping. And I mean massive. I adore descriptive books. I do not adore the description of every single surgical instrument known to man. I do not adore knowing the color of shirt every single person is wearing. Info-dumping equals boredom.The end of the end for me and the last reason I am giving this only two stars, is the end. You may want to skip this part if you plan to read the book. Dr. McDouchie spends 99% of the book lying to his wife. Straight out lying about what is going on. Finally, he reveals some things. His wife is an educated woman, not a stupid bitch. But, at the end of the book, Dr. McDouchie asks her to do something completely illegal. He convinces her to do it by saying it will affect their children if she doesn't do it. The reality is that it will just affect him and his career. And, of course, she listens. What the actual fuck. She listens to a man who has fucked her over and is a complete asshole and a LIAR. I cant. I just cannot.If you want a medical thriller kick, my advice is to stick with Dr. Cook. Dr. McDouchie really isn't worth it.2 Ninja-Bunnehs-Wearing-Scrubs stars(Thank you to NetGalley and Dr. Parsons for the arc.

With the help from his outgoing and charming wife Sally, he learns he is a top candidate for his dream job in Boston after he completes his surgical residency. However, when a patient under Steve\u2019s care dies, his job prospects are less secure. With the help of a friend, Steve tries to get to the bottom of some suspicious events going on in the hospital, but he puts himself and his family in the targets of a dangerous killer.This is a unique medical thriller by an author who obviously knows the inner workings of a hospital. It has many exciting parts, but sometimes gets bogged down in medical details that don\u2019t move the story forward. I could get past that, but what ruined the story for me is the main character. Steve Mitchell is intelligent and clever, but also arrogant and clueless. There are several scenes right from the start of the book that tell you there is going to be trouble for Steve. He and other doctors in the story mention that confidence is necessary for a surgeon, but the over-confidence and arrogance Steve shows is unlikable and scary, especially for unfortunate patients who must deal with his poor decisions. He has no bedside manner at all, and just when I would think he had learned from his mistakes, he would go back to the same behavior. I can forgive a character for poor judgment, but Steve never learns and never grows. At work, he\u2019s a know-it-all, and at home he says he loves his wife, but that isn\u2019t apparent from his actions.The book holds a few surprises, and has many moments of tense, thrilling suspense. Unfortunately, throughout much of the book, I felt a sickening sense of dread instead of excitement, knowing that is Steve is faced with two choices for any given decision, he will pick the wrong one and then he and others will suffer the consequences accordingly. That made parts of the book predictable and tedious as Steve does one stupid thing after another and doesn\u2019t seem sorry for his actions. The ending took me by surprise and it was enjoyable, if a little too pat.With a more likable main character, this would have been a better book. Readers who like the medical thrillers by Robin Cook may like \u201cDoing Harm\u201d. The main difference is Cook\u2019s characters fight some type of conspiracy or dangerous killer to protect their patients, while the main character of this book is only worried about saving his own job, and to some degree his family.This book was provided to me by NetGalley through the courtesy of St. Martin\u2019s Press in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Trinity", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2291840-trinity", "userReview": "I was really excited to read this book because of the amazing reviews. I'm wondering how many of them were paid for it. I'm sorry but this book was ridiculous. First of all I feel like the author has no respect for women. The not very pretty and emotionless wife, the hot crazy murderer, the pale and anorexic ocd lawyer, the other anorexic date at the dinner party... wtf seriously?Then we have Louis.. if you're going to write about a Marine, do it right. Once a Marine, always a Marine. You never call one an ex Marine ... its former. Also they don't call themselves soldiers either, that's army..As for the plot... it was just stupid. People like to get the true essence of a killer which was not delivered from Steve's point of view. For a surgeon, he was a moron. Medical terminology went far beyond helpful into making me feel like I was studying for an exam. There was no thrill and no mystery.

I recently read Snapshot, a law-type thiller which was written by a former Federal prosecutor--and now this one, a medical thriller written by a urologist. While these authors have a lot of knowledge on what they are writing about, they are unforunately not writers. In the novel Doing Harm, the plot is pretty ridicolus, the characters are one-dimensional, the killer is revealed way too early on, the main chracter is completely unlikeable, and the author spends a lot of time trying to educate the reader in a very obvious way.

I agree with him. The writing was capable, informative, and overall entertaining. However, the plot was entirely predictable and the female characters had no umph. What got me to read this book was Stephen King\u2019s quote, \u201cBest\u2026medial thriller I've read in 25 years. Terrifying OR scenes, characters with real texture.\u201d This reminds me why Gabrielle Zevin\u2019s character A.J. Fikry called these blurbs \u201cthe blood diamonds of the book industry\u201d. First, 25 years is a long time frame; this book was okay, but I hope it isn\u2019t the standard for medical thrillers. Second, \u201ccharacter with real texture\u201d is a push. The main character, maybe. All the others? They are pretty thin, especially the women (both in development and author\u2019s male-oriented description).Surgery wise, this book is great. I love going into the operating room scenes with this author. The terminology is lush with detail, bringing us right into the blood and guts without pulling punches. The author makes no amends for the plethora of medical terms, and I\u2019m grateful for it. I have my doubts about letting a Chief Resident have this much reign in a hospital, but I\u2019m willing to disbelieve.I have a quote to replace King\u2019s: \u201cthe most predictable book I\u2019ve read this year\u201d. I opened the book, I knew how it would end. I think I set a record. The author laid out every stereotype possible and fulfilled each one. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it was still a lot of fun and I was entertained, but no guesswork was involved.Bottom line: if you enjoy medical thrillers, this one utilizes accurate terminology in an entertaining manner.

He\u2019s married to a wonderful wife and has two delightful children. Life can\u2019t get much better. Then his patients start dying, and Steve realizes that the deaths are not accidents. Steve has to stop the deaths before his professional future is irrevocably destroyed\u2026but he can\u2019t tell anyone what is happening without risking both his career and his family. Trained to save lives with scalpel and suture, now Steve has to stop a different kind of killer, and he has to do it by himself (Yes, he really cannot tell anyone, and that is part of the suspense.).It is truly hard to believe that this is a debut novel. The characters are vivid; the suspense is masterfully done; the medical background is rich and very true-to-life.A board-certified urologist who is on the medical faculty at UC San Diego, the author is in a perfect position to depict life in a large teaching hospital, and the medical atmosphere was to me perhaps the best aspect of this excellent book. First, there is the ordered turmoil of the operating rooms and the wards. Then there are the effects on the doctors whose performance can literally mean life or death to their patients. Parsons does an excellent job of showing those effects, whether it be through the candid \u201cshop talk\u201d that grosses out the non-physicians at a dinner party or Steve\u2019s occasional musings about life and death and his patients. Finally, there is the medical science itself. Young doctors love their field and live their field, and it is very natural for Steve and his friends to share it in detail. I found the medical information fascinating, whether it was the explanation of just what an embolus is or the description of exactly how a surgeon makes a specific type of incision. This medical detail enriched the book without getting in the way.Narrator Steve Mitchell is an unusually sympathetic protagonist for a thriller(even if he doesn\u2019t like cats), a genre filled with alienated, dysfunctional types who have some redeeming feature or passion that makes them interesting. With an undergraduate degree in computer science and a minor in literature in addition to his medical training, he is the type of overachiever often seen in medicine, but his personality is rounded out by the depictions of his family life. Parsons also does a nice job on cameo characters like Mr. Bernard, the Socrates-quoting carpenter who is one of Steve\u2019s patients. Luis, an ex-Marine from East LA who earned a double major from UC Berkley in biochemistry and philosophy before going to medical school, is a wonderful enigma. There is warmth to the book in addition to chills, and I found myself tearing up after the death of a patient when Steve meets the patient\u2019s family.The story was gripping and hard to put down, and I was left wanting more from this author. Parsons says in his introduction that the seeds of this book were planted when he was in high school and took twenty years to harvest, but he mentions looking forward to his next project with his editor.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to like all of the characters, because their flaws make them more human. Steve did have some grandiose ideas about himself and his talents as a surgeon, but when his world started to crumble, his future was hanging by a thread, he willingly became part of the biggest betrayal of all, to his wife and his family.

All hell is braking loose and Steve has no control over what is happening. His reputation is suddenly in jeopardy just as he realizes that he may be closer to the killer than he thinks. What works for DOING HARM is the reader is exposed to all of Steve Mitchell\u2019s flaws. Main characters need to have flaws in order to translate onto the page and become three dimensional.

Top of his class, his career set in front of him as he's offered a faculty position at the institution he wants to work at, adoring wife and two beautiful daughters with a third child on the way.A few of my statements might provide a little too much detail of the novel so STOP reading here for potential SPOILERS if that bothers you.Steve's ego gets the better of him and a patient suffers ultimately fatal complications leading from this surgical error. However, this is not the first and only death at the hospital. Are these deaths by the hands of someone nefarious or are they just complications? This becomes the crux of the novel and Steve works hard to save his career and ultimately his family.Mr. Parsons (or should I say doctor) knows how to write a taut thriller. I love his voice. The pacing was great. I both loved and hated Steve and some of his frustration over caring for difficult patients is spot on.I would have gladly given this novel FIVE stars had it not been for some of the medical details that were just not accurate enough for me to give a full five star rating-- particularly since medical accuracy in novels (particularly medical thrillers) is my platform.The author states he had help from two medical physicians for the novel and his bio states he is a urologist currently practicing (which makes sense for the lead character, etc). I can tell he did spend time getting the details right. It's just missing that finesse of what REALLY happens at the bedside, especially from a nursing perspective, and it might have benefited him to have a practicing nurse from a critical care area read through the book. Particularly one that has worked at a teaching institution. I found some of the nursing aspects (shocking when there is no rhythm, allowing a medical student to give potassium IV, overdosing a patient with potassium by having someone steal 15 bags of IV potassium, bringing a morgue cart up right at the end of a code) a little troubling. Also, giving 150mg of Ketamine to an adult and it not completely incapacitating her.Overall, I did like the book a lot. I think readers with a non-medical background will not be distracted by the medical inaccuracies. I will definitely read more from this author.Thank you Kelly Parsons and St. Martin's Press for providing me a copy of Doing Harm via Net Galley. A positive review was not required for my free copy of the novel."}, {"userName": "Marilyn Rondeau", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4952783-marilyn-rondeau", "userReview": "Steve Mitchell, chief resident at a prestigious teaching hospital in Boston has everything going for him. Ambitious, intelligent, confident and at the top of the heap for a coveted job to join the faculty - his future is practically a given! But in the space of a few days, a patient dies, a simple surgery turns into a disaster, and Steve realizes a killer is on the loose in the hospital. Indications are pointing in his direction, and Steve is aware he is being set up by a cold blooded psychopath who is forcing him to play a game of strategy before they kill another patient. *** Thrills, chills, and a totally absorbing medical thriller will send the reader into a high adrenaline rush with this debut book by board certified doctor and author Kelly Parsons. This is an accurate behind the scenes look at the inner workings of a hospital where not only do the doctors have your life in their hands, one must hope to God that there are no psychopaths running around wearing white medical jackets and injecting deadly chemicals into your IV\u2019s. Or for that matter, any of the other horrendous things that this author\u2019s villain did in this piece believing that these deaths \u2018served the greater good\u2019!

Within 72 hours his world was crashing around him, and he was sitting in the cross-hairs of a brilliant psychopath who was blackmailing and forcing him to play her sick games with a taunt of \u201cstop me if you can\u201d! Bottom Line: With plenty of medical discussions describing procedures and such, most medical people should find this book right up their alley; with the edge of the seat cat-and-mouse game the author proceeded to tell, medical thriller aficionados should find themselves gasping for breath as the intense game comes to a thrilling climax!

This book took quite plot twist and turns which kept the pages flying. While some readers may find some of the medical scenes a bit too realistic, I loved what those details brought to the story. This book was written by a doctor and the surgery scenes definitely were authentic.Dr. Steven Mitchell is the married father of 2 girls. He is a senior resident at University Hospital and loves the surgical aspects of his job. He and his wife Sally both hope that he will be able to continue working at University after he completes his residency. Steve works with Luis at the hospital and the pair will also be working with a medical student, GiGi, for a period of time. Early in the book, Steve has a remarkably bad day in the hospital that ends with one patient dead and another clinging to life. As the death is being reviewed, Steve realizes that he may not be completely responsible for the death. Steve tries to stay one step ahead of the culprit while holding on to the things he holds dear in his life and protecting the hospital's patients.Steve is not always the most likeable character. He starts off in the book with a bit of a cocky attitude which moves into full blown jerk mode at a point. As he finds himself in the middle of a deadly game, he became more relate able. He realizes that he has made mistakes, admits those mistakes,and does his best to move forward. I would recommend this book to anyone who like a fast paced thriller. There are some graphic medical scenes that could bother some readers and intrigue others. I find myself in the second group. I look forward to reading future works from this debut author."}, {"userName": "Jenny Maloney", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/854965-jenny-maloney", "userReview": "The author of this novel is obviously an intelligent dude. While some readers may find medicalese a difficult language to navigate, I thought it made this thriller waaaay more thrilling than it would've been otherwise. When our main character, Chief Resident Steve Mitchell, is up to his elbows in tumors and delicate procedures, it's hard to look away. You feel every placement of Steve's instruments in this story and Parsons does a pretty good job of explaining all of the procedures and the stakes involved. And if Doing Harm was just about Mitchell dealing with those things, this would be an awesome story. Alas...he went and added more 'plot' in the form of a questionable cat-and-mouse game between Mitchell and a bad guy whom I shall not name here. Without giving too many massive spoilers away -- the problem with this story is that the villain is not believable. All I'm going to say is that you cannot just label someone a 'psychopath' and expect readers to just go along. Basically it boils down to this: the baddy thinks Mitchell is a really smart guy and wants to challenge him to a game of life-or-death for the hell of it. Umm...no. There needs to be motivation from both the protagonist and the antagonist. Unfortunately, the first half of this book was leading to a five star review and then I found out who the antagonist was and the reasoning behind these evil medical murders.

It seems that there is something more sinister happening at the hospital like a serial killer that wants to teach Steve a lesson. This book did not read like Mr. Parson's first book but more like Mr. Parson's fourth book. He comes out of the gate to impress. It has been a while since I have read a good medical thriller. I really enjoyed this book. It really felt like I was in the hospital. In fact, it kind of felt like I was in Steve's shoes. However I did have to wonder in the beginning if Steve was incompetent in his medical skills. He did not seem to be a very lucky guy. When his patients start getting sick this is when Steve's compassion shows and makes him a good guy. One that I can root for despite his momentary lapse in judgment.

Steve has an exciting future before him and then proceeds to make some of the stupidest decisions he possible could. Add to that a possibly psychopathic killer and Steve's in some real trouble. There's your story. King's right in the the descriptions of the surgery are good and detailed, but the plot is, well, fairly routine for your standard medical thriller, I think.
