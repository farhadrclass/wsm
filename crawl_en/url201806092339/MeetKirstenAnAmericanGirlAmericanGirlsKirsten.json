This is also our first book in any American Girl series and our first book by this author.We love reading books that take place during the 1800s time period. In this book, Kirsten's family immigrates from Sweden to America in 1854. They are travelling to Minnesota to join family members already settled there. Along the way, they experience some difficulties. The series continues with five more books.We really enjoyed the book! When I told my daughters that there is an American Girl website and that there is an historical Kirsten doll, they were so excited! They went from not knowing who American Girl was to now having American Girl dolls, catalogs, and playing games on their website! Smart marketing! We are hooked on the American Girl historical books and dolls."}, {"userName": "Molly", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/699639-molly", "userReview": "For being targeted at girls b/w the ages of like 6-11, this book was surpsingly profound. I mean, (not to spoil anything for you, but...), her best friend dies of scarlet fever as they are on their way immigrating over from Sweden to America to make a better life for themselves. (A dingy long cabin in Minnesota if I recall...) And besides the sob factors, it also delves into a fair amount of cultural exposure. That's pretty heavy reading material for a kid... This is probably one of the most emotionally impactful books I can remember reading; especially as a child, but even now."}, {"userName": "Tanya", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3672391-tanya", "userReview": "Good.

So I started to read this book and I actually really enjoyed it. So far I have only read all of Felicity's books and the first two of Josefina, I am enjoying Josefina's books but I just really like the colonial times which is when Felicity is set so I think that is part of the reason I enjoy her so much. I always enjoyed the pioneer time, I just like how things were back then, except the diseases. *****Spoilers******The beginning of this book starts very interesting, Kirsten and her family are on a ship to Minnesota. At first, since Kirsten's mom was sick I thought she was going to not pass the guy checking them if they were sick or not. Thankfully she did but when Kirsten got lost, I kind of got scared. But then there was this nice lady that spoke English whom didn't understand Kirsten. But they still communicated through pictures. This lady was very nice and I just think it was really cute on how they communicated through pictures than the lady brought Kirsten back to her family. Once she was back together with her family, they left. To go on a train, when Kirsten had to say goodbye to her friend I thought it was really sad. I would be very sadend if I had to leave my friend on the train but then Kirsten tells her friend that even if they never see each other again they will always be looking at the same sun. How cute is that? Anyway, when they do meet each other again it is really cute because they are so excited and you an tell their friendship was real. Their families even decided to stay together and when they got on the ship, Kirstens mom had a right to worry about the cholera. When Marta got sick with it, I was thinking they can't kill her but when they did, it made me realize how true it really was. A lot of people traveling died even the ones closest to you. Tears might have even come to my eyes. Then when they got off the boat, Kirsten couldn't even look at it, like she missed her friend! They were amazing friends. And then when they had to leave all of their stuff in the trunks behind because they couldn't get a wagon. Kirsten had to leave her doll and that was like the only thing that reminded her of Marta, they had always played with their dolls together so it was very sad to know she had to leave it behind until they went back for it. Once Kirsten was finally at uncle Olav's his \"daughters\" were so sweet and they really loved Kirsten. I thought this was really cute because they weren't mad they were getting a sort of sister. There is normally always this one child that doesn't like the main character and I am happy that it isn't one of Olav's \"daughters\", especially after Kirstens best friend just died. Overall it was surprisingly a very deep story. I really enjoyed it."}, {"userName": "Jen \u2022 Just One More Page", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4973586-jen-just-one-more-page", "userReview": "[I\u2019ll pretense this by saying, this is a children\u2019s book! It is not going to be the same length or difficulty level as a standard adult novel, but in no way will this impact the complexity or quality, so if you go into reading children\u2019s books with this in mind, then you\u2019ll find them much easier to enjoy.Now. With that said. I remember reading and LOVING the American Girl books when I was a kid, and I recently had the idea to re-read and re-experience them so I would have better reasons to continue recommending them, so here I am, starting with the oldest series.And it was just as good as I remember it being. :DIt was chock full of accurate historical facts, made the characters feel real, gave them real, accurate historical problems, made history feel alive and interesting, and made Kirsten herself seem not all that different from girls of today - which, I am sure, is the entire point.The multiple parts where femaleness was embraced and enjoyed did not escape me either. Yes, the book was only some 60 pages long and is meant for an audience a third of my age, but I loved reading it nonetheless. I am absolutely glad that American Girls are still as popular today as they were 15-20 years ago, and I can only hope that the other girls\u2019 books and the other books in this series are just as well done!

I blitzed through the first four Kirsten books (Meet Kirsten, Kirsten Learns a Lesson, Kirsten's Surprise, and Happy Birthday Kirsten). I have this thing about rereading books that I haven't read since I was 10 or younger... in one way, it's fantastic because you can relive those moments when you were first falling in love with characters or, in my case, historical fiction. However, rereading these books can also be really really disappointing because, as an adult, I realize how totally horrible the writing in the series is. Ugh. Seriously, Janet Beeler Shaw, your stories are ultra boring. No wonder Kirsten was discontinued by American Girl. Your books make her seem like a snoozeville character when in reality, being a Swedish immigrant with rad circular braids is super cool and exciting. My adult self gives this series two stars, but my inner child totally bumped it up to three starts."}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68766076-maria", "userReview": "Kirsten has been sailing to Minnesota for a long time.

I read some of the reviews before reading the book and was worried about the friend dying being too heavy a concept to teach but I think it was handled well, was definitely a reality for pioneers, and can bring up some good discussion.

I should have read the other two that were in the box set I found this in, because I was never really well-acquainted with Kirsten's story and I'm curious to know more, especially since she's been discontinued in the lineup.

Kirsten, Mama, Papa, Lars, and Peter experience many hardships on their journey from the beginning on the small ship they took to cross the Atlantic. Space was very tight and many people got sea sick. When they finally landed in New York, Kirsten finds herself lost after going into the city with Papa and Lars. She cannot speak English yet and has a very difficult time finding her way back to her parents, although she does figure it out. The whole family then boards a hot and crowded train to Chicago, after which they find themselves on a steam boat travelling up the Mississippi to Minnesota. They finally reach Minnesota with one more trial to face. They don't have enough money for a wagon and have to walk all the way to Kirsten's Uncle's farm for several hours, while leaving a majority of their possessions behind taking only what they can carry. They finally arrive at Uncle Olav's farm to a warm welcome. Kirsten becomes instant friends with her two cousins Lisbeth and Anna and realizes that Minnesota can be her home just like Sweden was. This first installment of the Kirsten set of American Girl books is a great introduction to this telling of the life of pioneers in the 1800's. I have fond memories of reading the American Girl books as a child and I owe much of my current love of history to these books which were some of my first exposure to historical fiction. All the American Girl books including this one, do a fantastic job of presenting historical events, including the hard parts of them, to children while maintaining a friendly tone. One of the greatest concerns of historical fiction for children is that many of the most notable historical events and time periods are riddled with dark and unsettling and heartbreaking things that happened to people. The American Girl books present these events in a light fashion while still maintaining the historical accuracy and integrity that helps the story retain an educational value. I greatly enjoy this book and find it a great starter to kids wanting to learn more about American history."}, {"userName": "Kristine", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/582776-kristine", "userReview": "Pretty excited that even though I'm reading this aloud at bedtime I was getting the laundry and walked in the room to see my kid picking it up and reading on her own. I won't give up hope, but I think I'm coming to a realization that my child won't be as a voracious reading-child as I was. I was an introverted, shy, passive kid that thrived on doing what I was told. Ellie is crazy, active, kinetic (always needing to move and sing and dance), creative, expressive, moody child that doesn't even like being told that she has to spell things the 'right' way instead of 'her' way. So, I'll continue to do the best I can by immersing her in a million books and . . . well - we'll see what happens. Anyways, we loved meeting Kirsten. I was a little nervous about Ellie handling Kirsten's friend dying - but my child's a little weird and wasn't crushed but rather fascinated and had a million questions. I love that there is a cute and sweet way to sneak historical fiction in with the kidlets. I do believe we'll have Santa leave a few of these under our Christmas tree this year."}, {"userName": "M.M.

There is some culture shock for Kirsten to deal with, but it is better with the presence and support of her extended family. There is still some sadness in here, with a death, but then, as I said, this book felt more real to me than Felicity.

I plan to finish this series and then continue with the books I normally read afterwards. I would recommend this book to elementary school children even if it is a little sad since her friend Marta died. But it goes with how it was back then.
