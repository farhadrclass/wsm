His lead, Easy Rawlins, is a Louisiana/Texas transplant now working in L.A. as a janitor, maintaining the building he surreptitiously owns. As any decent detective fiction, the city plays a prominent role in the life of the detective and Mosley nicely captures a range of African-American experiences in period L.A. Easy is in a tough spot and is hoping Mofass, the man who manages his property, can give him some tips on dealing with the I.R.S. Mofass' not-so-helpful advice is to lie to the Revenue Man. \"Go on in there and lie, Mr. Rawlins. Tell 'em you don't own nuthin.' Tell 'em that you a workin' man and that somebody must have it out for you to lie and say you got that property. Tell 'em that and then see what they gotta say.\"When he arrives at home, the wife of his volatile best friend, Mouse, is in his house with their son. She's split with Mouse and thought Easy would provide a refuge. \"She could knock a man into next Tuesday, or she could hold you so tight that you felt like a child again, in your mother's loving embrace.\" Easy follows Mofass' advice, but gets a bad feeling when the agent subsequently asks him to get (non-existent) paperwork together and to be ready for his call. When he returns downtown, he comes to the attention of a different kind of fed. It's 1953, Communist hunting is a national pastime, and when Easy is offered an out with the IRS if he 'reports for his country,' he finds himself reluctantly agreeing.I like the language, although thankfully Easy's internal dialogue avoids dialect, as I find it makes for a long read. I like the awareness Easy has of modifying his speech patterns depending on which sub-culture he's in. Its a survival strategy, and I enjoy seeing how Easy uses it to his advantage. Mosley is masterful at weaving different race issues in the story, from Easy getting an education on the marginalization Jews experience, to Easy's own interaction with mostly white lawmen. There's an enlightening scene where he meets a black L.A. detective at a death scene and watches him interact as equals with his partner. I also love the way Easy describes the people he meets:\"His color was dark brown but bright, as if a powerful lamp shone just below his skin.\"\"A sepia-colored woman\"\"John's face looked like it was chiseled in ebony\"\"Jackson's skin was so black that it glinted blue when in the full sun\"It's a small thing that doesn't appear in most white detective fiction novels, but it says so much about the author and his regard for his characters.Problems for me center around narrative arc; I feel like Mosley slips a lot of characters in, some important and many incidental. It becomes hard to distinguish between important and inconsequential. More significantly, I found the character of Easy a bit less likeable in this book; as Kemper said, Easy has \"man ho tendencies,\" making him harder to like. I give Mosley credit for putting Easy in a hard ethical place in relation to the I.R.S.; however, he also does it to him in his emotional life. Between the sexism, Easy's own anti-Semitism, his willingness to use the church and his affair, there isn't much to redeem him.Note: this edition also contains a short story, 'Silver Lining,' inserted before the main story. It proves to be a sort of spoiler for a plot point in A Red Death. If you care about such things, skip it.Overall, two and a half stars. I think I'll head back to Devil in a Blue Dress and capture more of the magic I remember from Easy.Cross posted at http://clsiewert.wordpress.com/2013/0..."}, {"userName": "Didi", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2682140-didi", "userReview": "I'm loving this series and I'm not a series person. Easy Rawlins is lovable even when he messes up. You're still still behind him. Mosley continues to paint a vivd picture of blacks living in racist America in the 1940s, specifically in and around Los Angeles. The story has recurring characters, murder, and enough ups and downs to keep any reader interested. I love the old crime detective feel of the novel.

Easy Rawlins has dealt with plenty of death as a black World War II veteran who also has been mixed up with very bad people in post-war Los Angeles. But this time he\u2019ll have to deal with taxes, too. Which is worse? Ask Al Capone.Set in the early \u201850s, it\u2019s been a few years since Easy\u2019s introduction in Devil in a Blue Dress, and he has set himself up nicely by taking advantage of an illicit windfall to buy some apartment buildings as well as acting as an unlicensed private detective for the black community. Easy got a little too cute for his own good when he set up his real estate purchases and now he has a zealous IRS agent after him. His only way out is take a deal offered by the FBI to befriend and report on a suspected communist agitator working with a church in Easy\u2019s neighborhood.Easy soon has even bigger problems than being sent to prison for tax evasion with the appearance of an old flame looking to rekindle a relationship. The problem is that the woman is the wife of Easy\u2019s old friend, the murderous Mouse. Getting on Mouse\u2019s bad side is a sure way to get dead, but Easy can\u2019t stay away from the woman he considers the love of his life. Just as he did in the previous book, Mosley has recreated a rich and vivid world of the black community in post-war L.A. and then populated it with a variety of characters for Easy to interact with. The theme in this one is betrayal with Easy having to spy on a man he comes to like and respect as well as his guilt about his feelings for Mouse\u2019s wife. The one sour note in this one is Easy\u2019s man-ho tendencies. Despite carrying on with a woman he claims to have deep feelings for, Easy casually beds several other women over the course of the book and never once shows the slightest bit of guilt or remorse over any of them. Maybe Mosley was trying to illustrate the different standards that applied with regards to men and women in days of yore, but it makes Easy appear like kind of a heartless bastard."}, {"userName": "Greg", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42508-greg", "userReview": "...because I said I'd probably change my mind in twenty four hours and it's been almost exactly twenty four hours...Forgive me for a moment while I engage in a small bit of phenomenological bracketing (or maybe this is something like deconstruction) and put aside for a moment the race of the characters and the socio-historical context that the story is set in and just focus on the skeletal remains of the book. What I'm left with is the story of a tax evader who the law catches up with and offers him the chance to get rid of his own legal troubles in exchange for helping to ruin someone else's life. The tax evader has some pangs and conscience and feels weird for what he is doing and finds himself in a lot of hot water when people he knows start winding up dead. He sleeps with a bunch of women, gets into some fights and unravels a conspiracy and in the end all is good for him. Without the 1905's racial and political setting the story is kind of weak, at least to me. It's a pretty standard story filled with quite a bit of masculine bravado and the resolution is a mixture of being kind of obvious and also kind of 'wait, how exactly did he make that final jump in reasoning to figure this out?' Throw in some of the red scare elements to the story and it takes on a bit more interesting shape but I was left wondering if mysteries aren't just all like those cozy ones, where there is a theme like baking or knitting or cats to add color to the standard who-dunnit fare. Here instead of say a scrap booking group who get caught up in a murrrder! it's an African-American swindler of sorts who is a lot of ways just another iteration of the hard-boiled detective. There is the tough talking, the excessive drinking, the witty comments made in the face of danger, the slightly damaged psyche and the irresistibleness that makes just about every female character in the book end up in his bed at some point. And on the last point, maybe I'm becoming something of a (male) spinster-like prude in my nearing middle-ages (what would be the male term, bachelor doesn't work, but I've got my cat and I've got my books) but I'm starting to get a little annoyed when too much sex pops up in my books. Sex for sex sake in books is boring to me and feels more like the author projecting fantasies that (s)he would like to see happen in and letting the main character live them out. Not that any of the sex here is explicit or anything and it's probably just a reaction to having just read Edge, where every woman wants to throw themselves into the bed of the hero (but he gallantly doesn't take advantage of most of them!) but it is kind of a boring thing to just throw into a book when it doesn't do anything to add to the story or advance the plot or whatever a book is supposed to do. All of that complaining and whining aside, the book is a nice read and it moves along at a fairly good pace. I might have enjoyed it more if I had given it my full attention instead of reading it when it was convenient to have a mass-market with me to read, and when I didn't need the convenience of a mass-market I was reading other books at the time. And maybe this isn't the kind of book that should be spread out over two weeks time to finish But nothing in the book really ever grabbed me or made me think, wow I'd really like to read something more by the author. If I was more of a fan of mysteries I'd probably read something else by him, but instead my search will go on for another mystery/crime writer that I get a lot of enjoyment out of."}, {"userName": "Tfitoby", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5454475-tfitoby", "userReview": "Easy Rawlins is such a great character for a noir novel simply because Walter Mosley writes him with such a clear and unique voice.Even in this relatively disappointing follow-up to Devil in a Blue Dress he is highly enjoyable as a man primarily looking after himself in a series of intrigues, fights, double crosses and sexual encounters used as an exploration of race differences in American society in 1952.In this novel EVERYONE is the bad guy, including Easy. He might be looking to protect himself first and foremost but he realises that it's not always the correct thing to do. This self righteousness mixed with self-loathing is pretty standard for the genre but I don't think I've ever come across it in so forthright a way.The ambiguous nature of the entire cast of characters works well with the theme of paranoia and 'red-baiting,' the reader can't trust anyone to be on Easy's side much in the same way Americans of the period grew to distrust everyone amid their fears of Communism I guess."}, {"userName": "Alex", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20595982-alex", "userReview": "Wow, I love this series. Despite the plot being a little clunky, the action never slows. The second book in the Easy Rawlins series, this time it is 1953 and Easy is up to his neck in trouble with the IRS and the FBI is on his case to help them weed out communists in the local community of Watts. Mosley's real talent in this series is how he manages to portray the racial aspects of life as a black man in 1950s America; sadly highlighting how very little has changed. The dialogue is a joy and the issues of racism, poverty and corruption are beautifully realised. Can't wait for the third in the series to arrive in the mail."}, {"userName": "Algernon", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4728718-algernon", "userReview": "A step back in appeal for me after Devil in a Blue Dress , but still an interesting trip to the West Coast black ghetto in the fifties, at the height of the Communist witchhunt.Easy Rawlins is already established as the main character in this second mystery/thriller featuring him, so I expected some better pacing, easier to follow plot. It was instead a bit of a muddle with several separate murders that feel shoehorned / forced into one narrative. So what is really the connection between an apparent suicide in one of Rawlins rented appartments, violence against the minister of a black church, the IRS and the hunt for a Jewish labor organizer? Read on to find out.Easy goes for about three quarters of the book from one place to another, more like a passive observer than an active investigator. Then, in the last quarter of the book he starts throwing (and receiving) punches, some bullets fly, and generally secrets are revealed in a convenient and timely manner. He's also quite a hit with the ladies who have only to look at him to fall at his feet.For all my criticism, the voice of Mr. Rawlins feels authentic, anchored in the harsh realities of being a man of color before the Civil Rights Movement gained traction. He is a tough man because he needs to survive on these mean streets, but he is using his brains more than his fists, and is capable of selfless gestures and kindness towards his neighbors and friends. His rants against the establishment, the police and in general against the White Man, are still present, but a bit toned down compared to the debut novel. Maybe his financial relative affluence has polished some of the more abrasive aspects of his personality.The secondary characters are less well defined. I struggled a bit following who is who, especially the Church deacons and the barroom population.I would say this book is OK for the fans of the author, interested in continuing with the series, but not so impresive on its own merits."}, {"userName": "Tim Pendry", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1016626-tim-pendry", "userReview": "Fair warning is due - it takes you a third of the way before this book takes fire and the ending (which shall not be revealed here) is the usual sub-Chandleresque rush of confused data that plays the same role, in this genre, as the 'deus ex machina' once did in courtly drama - BUT the core of the book is brilliant.Why is Mosley so good when he is good (and when he is not stuck in the usual problem of series writers that he has to recapitulate so much for late entrants)? Because he writes with precision about a world that, although alien to non-Americans of any hue and only known by way of older men's reminiscences by younger American blacks, comes alive in his hands.Hue is an interesting aspect of the case here. I know of no white author who describes so frequently the precise tone of a man's skin. Mosley repeatedly and precisely gives you the skin tone of almost every non-white character in a way that defines his perceived character. He also describes the second skin - the clothes - in a way that makes you understand better how variation of costume was one means of differentiating a man from the crowd. Two FBI agents are indistinguishable ('twins') in dark uniforms and white skins but the ethnic communities are multi-coloured not only in skin tone but in dress. Then it hits you (as a non-black) - the agents of white society in their drab suits and white skin look alike in the way that we see aliens in movies look alike. Society, to the oppressed ethnic subject, is rule by conquering aliens and, of course, this trope has been used since in popular culture to show humans (invariably white) ruled by aliens in order to spread a message of violent gung-ho resistance to oppression. You can see Mosley moving his story line towards the world of Black Power in stages here but he matches this with his first 'Philadelphia' black cop. This black is certainly not fazed by his racist colleagues and, though a bit player, he hints at the other option for the black community - integration on equal terms and civil rights. This is done subtly so that you would scarcely notice.I always thought I understood the role of charismatic religion in black society but now I feel that I understand it - an education given so lightly as to be imperceptible. Nor does he compromise with a character whose morality is Chandler's but placed under conditions of oppression where the costs of goodness and integrity mean that you are likely not to survive for long if you are too precious. There are many subtleties in this book - not least the understated play on the experience of the holocaust for one of the protagonists (black-Jewish relations often being particularly fraught in more recent times) with a metaphor of the poisoning of red ants' nests coming across as surprisingly unheavy-handed. And, finally, beyond politics and religion, you have sex. Mosley at one point seems to be constantly rutting and this is subversive, given the 'moral' standards of contemporary white society. There is no guilt or shame in either him or the women - or in the society they live in. Mosley courageously does not worry about stereotyping but just lays out the lifestyle of this relatively young black male and lets the reader choose his stance. You realise that Philip Marlowe had it easy as a white man in a white society. While you may despair at our hero's tormented self-centredness at times, it is not for us to judge - even though not a few black 'resistance' heroes might want to string him up as the worst sort of exploitative petty capitalist on the make.The story is set in the period when America was witch-hunting Communists and the 'take' on the politics of the black community under these conditions is subtle. This is all you need to know about the story."}, {"userName": "Heidi", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1071252-heidi", "userReview": "A long time ago I decided never again to read crime fiction written by a man. I was so disappointed by the James Patterson \"Women's Murder Club\" book that I read (I actually felt it was worse than Patricia Cornwall!), that I decided that was it. No more male writers.But there came a day when I needed a heck of a lot of mental distraction on my (hour-long) drive home from work, and when I went to the library I discovered that they had four Mosley audio books and another four or five *books* of his. And as it was the only thing that looked vaguely interesting in the audio book section - and because it would count for 50books_poc - I decided to give Mosley a chance.Mosley's writing, and his character Easy Rawlins, remind me of Sara Paretsky and VI Warshawski, a favourite writer/character duo that I've been sorely missing of late. They've got the rough edges, the gritty cities, the edge to their stories that other writers don't quite match.Mosley is clearly a notch or two above James Patterson, although I don't know that I'd trust him to write a female pov character. His female characters are all just a little too much the sexual object, and not quite enough human being. (That said, I loved both Etta Mae and Shirley... and think either of them would have been the making of Easy.) I found myself liking and admiring Easy quite a bit: despite how much he despised himself, and despite the truth of his background. And I certainly did enjoy the resolution of the mystery.(Whether it's Mosley, or the rhythm used by the reader on the audio book, the odd thing is I can hear that same rhythm echoing through the words I write in this review. The rise and fall of that rich voice that I loved listening to for just over a week, morning and evening, to and from work.)I don't want to read (or listen to) too much Mosley too fast. I don't want to risk Patricia Cornwall syndrome. (I read every Cornwall book a housemate of mine owned in a single weekend while I was procrastinating on my honours thesis. Reading that many at a single gulp exposed the lack of creativity that Cornwall had in her storylines, and I've never brought myself to read another one since.) So I'll leave it a while before I pick another one up. But one day I certainly will. Especially those audio books."}, {"userName": "aPriL does feral sometimes ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes", "userReview": "Unbelievably good. Constructed tight as a drum. Rawlins would have made an excellent Roman Patrician. His intelligence which works on three layers of reality at all times plus a ruthlessness worthy of a Julius Caesar helps him maneuver through so many circles - police, Black businessmen, Jewish concentration camp survivors, Black church institutional support, Latino businessmen, the IRS, FBI, murderous white prejudice - all while surviving the paranoid Communist hunting of the 1950's. When this particular episode in his life begins Rawlins is attending school getting a degree, reading about the Roman Empire, attempting to build a future for himself by owning rundown apartment buildings and maintaining his own little house. His determination is awesome; however the lack of legitimate means of achieving success due to the powerful racial prejudices of America forces him to methods familiar to any ancient Roman citizen. He sees himself as a man forced to be bad by society but not as bad as he could be, and he is happy to be good and generous when he can. I totally agree with his usual clear vision of humanity. Rawlins IS a good man in a very harsh world.

Too often in mystery, authors oversimplify by creating characters who fall into that bluntly honest/call 'em like I see 'em mold that unfortunately robs them of depth and nuances. Easy doesn't play that game, and it's part of what makes his continuing adventures a reward for readers."}, {"userName": "Madeline", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/111921-madeline", "userReview": "We're back to the American detectives in my class, and are on the adventures of Easy Rawlins - who I guess can't really be called a detective at all. He's not a private eye like Sam Spade or Philip Marlowe, he's not a retired detective like Poirot, and he's not even one of those armchair detectives like Miss Marple or Sherlock Holmes. I guess the best way to describe Easy Rawlins is as a sort of mercenary. If someone needs a job done, he does it. If they want protection from somebody, he'll do it. He figures things out, but he's never actively being a detective in the traditional sense. Instead, he just sort of goes along with whatever's happening and tries to keep his head above water. That's the setup for this novel - at the beginning, Rawlins is being investigated by the IRS (he has some slightly illegal business enterprises, and they want to know where he's getting the money). The IRS wants to put him in jail, but then the FBI swoops in and tells Rawlins that they'll get the IRS off his back if he does a job for them. With no real choice, Rawlins agrees. His job is to go to a local church and get in with a Jewish man named Chaim Wenzler, who is a Communist. Since this is the 50's, that means he's obviously evil and must be stopped. Except, of course, he turns out to be a decent guy and Rawlins is left to consider the question of who's right and who's wrong. Oh, and also he has to solve some murders that he's being framed for. You know, typical stuff.The book was interesting and fast-paced, and even though Mosley doesn't have the gift for description that other hard-boiled American detectives I've reviewed have, he still writes very well. I was also pleased to see that there are actually some good female characters in this book that don't fall into the stereotype of either Femme Fatale or Dame in Distress. There are at least three really good female characters in this novel, and they serve as more than just decoration and sex appeal. So, good for Mosley.

Still very enjoyable writing and great social commentary on what it meant to be a black man in Los Angeles in the 1950's but this time there was a bit too much commentary and a bit too little mystery. In fact, it kind of felt like Mosley forgot about the mystery and tacked on the mystery at the very end. Also, the final 'bad guy' was cartoonish and strange. Too many dangling threads were left out there for no discernible reason.That being said, the character development was fantastic and I'll definitely be checking in again with Easy Rawlins.\"I didn't even believe in history, really. Real was what was happening to me right then. Real was a toothache and a man you trusted who did you dirt. Real was an empty stomach or a woman saying yes, or a woman saying no. Real was what you could feel. History felt like TV for me, it wasn't the great wave of mankind moving through an ocean of minutes and hours. It wasn't mankind getting better either; I had seen enough murder in Europe to know that the Nazis were even worse than the barbarians at Rome's gate.

'\"God gives you what you earn, Mr. Rawlings.\" That seemed like a terrible curse coming from such a kind woman.' Moral ambiguity abounds as Easy and his associates seem every bit as villainous as the people who turn out to be the villains of the piece. Easy is sicced on a religious group with communist ties, but the people he is supposed to be investigating seem the least villainous of the lot. The thing about Easy's own complicity in dubious dealings is that it makes him capable of seeing the possibility of redemption for nearly anyone, even Mofass, who double-crossed him into this whole mess.

Easy has a habit of finding trouble and acting detective. In this outing he\u2019s infiltrating a communist cell for the FBI in order to avoid a federal charge for tax evasion. When people connected to both his IRS charge and his FBI case start dying, it seems he\u2019s swapped going to jail for non-payment of tax to going for murder. To add to his woes his personal life is a mess, starting an affair with EttaMae, the love of his life and partner of his best friend. The strength of the tale is its portrayal of the African-American experience in post-war America (both the seamier, darker underbelly and respectable business and church communities) and every-day and institutional racism, the sense of place, and the character of Easy Rawlins. Easy is a complex man in which good and evil battle internally and he\u2019s often the sinner using casual lies, deception, robbery and violence to make headway; while he has a moral compass of sorts helping people where he can, ultimately he prioritises protecting himself. Which is perhaps no surprise given the social circumstances of the poor, working class community he\u2019s operating in, which is a dog-eat-dog world. Where the tale struggles a little is with regards to the plot, which felt a little to tangled with a number of subplots and dozens of characters being threaded together \u2013 a death in one of the apartments Easy owns; a IRS case against Easy; a FBI case into a communist cell; an extortion racket in a church; EttaMae and Mouse arriving in the city \u2013 each with its own sub-plots and twists. There\u2019s plenty going on \u2013 scheming, violence, extortion, murder, sex - leaving Easy dazed and confused throughout much of the story. And so, to a degree, is the reader.

Easy Rawlins is in many ways at the mercy of events and his own hot emotions, but in other ways he is a skillful detective and social orchestrator who uses his knowledge of his African American community to get at the elusive truths.I liked this book better than the first in this series. I'm still not giving it 5 stars, (for one thing it didn't make me cry, although I did start to tear up at some of the father-son scenes in the book) but I am very comfortable with 4 stars and I seem to remember I struggled with rating Devil in a Blue Dress because parts of it were so bizarre. This story takes us on another roller coaster but it seemed to follow more conventional means or maybe I am just starting to get used to Easy's universe and morality.The social commentary was often subtle, since Easy is not necessarily a social activist, he just listens to things and knows things and the reader is left to read between the lines. But there were also issues introduced directly, like the notions of communism and blacklisting as seen in the 50's; Blacks getting more mainstream jobs, like police work; the role of religion in the African American community; the idea of the African Migration and the activism of W.E.B. DuBois; and how Blacks were/are at the mercy of the racism/power held by the White government. The book is not trying to find solutions to these issues, but just reading about these events is a progressive act, and as a White man who grew up in the 70's I found myself enlightened by a lot of what I read. Even Easy was changed during the course of this book, to what ends only time (and perhaps later novels) will tell.I feel it worth noting that the N-word was used much less frequently in the main body of the book, although the final confrontations seemed to make up for it through prodigious use in the final chapters. I realize the use of the N-word is one of the realities of Black life, and of the 1950's setting, but sometimes I'd like to know it is being said vicariously, without actually having to read the word over and over again. This may not bother most readers, but I thought it should be mentioned.Note: The edition I read contained an excerpt of a short story entitled Silver Lining. I won't review the story here, but I must say I was quite surprised it was just an excerpt since the book cover does not indicate that it is less than the full short story. It seems like a kind of under-handed marketing gimmick to get you to read the Six Easy Pieces collection. They've done it in all the re-releases of these earlier Easy Rawlins novels."}, {"userName": "John Bell", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2794539-john-bell", "userReview": "I was a HUGE fan of Devil in a Blue Dress and had been meaning to read the follow up A Red Death for a long time. For all of my excitement, I was ultimately disappointed after I finished it. It's not a terrible book by any stretch. Walter Mosley is an exceptional writer who is able to capture the mood and setting of 1940s Los Angeles better than any writer this side of Raymond Chandler. But I found the second Easy Rawlings story to be flat carbon copy of its predecessor, with few surprises and little real suspense. Easy is a complex, conflicted character who fits the classic anti-hero architype to a tee. He is as flawed as the criminals he pursues. But Mr. Mosley also puts him in a number of situations that not only feel unrealistic, they feel flat out ridiculous. I get Mosley's protrayal of Easy as a strong, virile man who has considerable talent when it comes to attracting women. It's a quality that puts him in good company among fictional private eyes. But it's a bit irritaing that Easy finds his way into the bed of practically every woman he comes into contact with practically from the moment he comes into contact with them. With all of this said, there were parts of the novel I truly enjoyed. And Easy Rawlings is as potent and interesting a character as there is in the hard-boiled mystery genre. I plan to continue with the series. I only hope that Easy's next adventure is a lot more interesting."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2517312-michael", "userReview": "My name\u2019s Ezekiel Rawlins, but you c\u2019n call me Easy.

Why can\u2019t I just stick to my own business?I think you\u2019ll like th\u2019 book.

An interesting premise, to place Easy Rawlins, the protagonist, at the heart of the 50's red scare. Also compelling to examine/experience racism from the black point of view. I suppose this is intended to be crime fiction in the noir tradition: the authority figures (white people) are all bad, the women are all sex objects, and most of the characters are violent, reactive types, a la Chandler? But it's difficult to feel too much sympathy for Easy in his self-created, tax-evading predicament. It seems that his \"friends\" don't like him much either, except for \"Mouse\" the sociopathic murderer... This might have been a better story if it explored more of the Hollywood blacklist angle; certainly could have used more character development.I've never read Walter Mosley, always wanted to, but not sure I will again."}, {"userName": "David B", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24673004-david-b", "userReview": "Some years after the events of \"Devil in a Blue Dress,\" Easy Rawlins's real estate investments are doing quite well.

At the same time, Easy's old flame shows up with her son, having left her husband Mouse, who happens to be Easy's friend and a sociopathic killer.Walter Mosley has written another fine mystery. Its setting, the black culture of 1950s Los Angeles, is a unique setting and makes for an interesting companion piece to Ellroy's LA Quartet. Easy's milieu is just as fascinating as the puzzle he must unravel.

Easy Rawlins is a complicated character, which I appreciate. It felt a bit sexist for me, though - all the women were \"begging for it\" a little too much.
