{"ratings": 60562, "userreviews": [{"userName": "Lucy", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3813315-lucy", "userReview": "I thought for a little bit about how to review this book, if I should go over all the weird mistakes and struggles with the world building chronologically or if I should just jump in at what bothered me most and work backwards. Generally, following the timeline of the book makes for a better review, but since I am so utterly horrified by the last third of the book I can't stomach talking about things like sewer systems, night vision, bad name choices, and human nature. All that keeps ringing in my mind when I look at the cover of this book are quotes from the main character on the subject of rape. Enclave is a YA dystopian novel about an incredibly dark world. I've read a few YA dystopians where rape came into play, but I have never encountered the subject treated as cavalier by an author and the main character. The handling of it could not have been more repulsive.As necessary background, Deuce grew up in a small and contained underground community which she is kicked out of after confessing to a crime she didn't commit to spare an equally innocent friend. She is thrust into a new world with a guide named Fade who hasn't been a part of the above ground world for many years. The people directly above their sewer grates are hostile. When Deuce and Fade come off a second battle with a gang who call themselves 'Wolves,' Deuce is taken off to be turned into a breeder -- essentially to be raped repeatedly in attempts to reproduce with her and grow their population, and Fade is taken off to be hunted down and eaten. Deuce manages to escape with the help of Tegan, a girl who was taken by the Wolves earlier and has spent much of her young life being raped and giving birth to stillborn children. Together, Tegan and Deuce rescue Fade.Fade, Deuce, and Tegan are hunted down by the Wolves while trying to escape the city. Stalker, the head of this gang, manages to get a hold of someone who helped them along the way so he can lure them out of hiding. Before things can come to a fight they are attacked by Freaks/Eaters/Muties who are the story's monsters. They decide to join forces with Stalker who is the sole surviving Wolf. They do this despite Tegan's vehement protests. They do this despite knowing Tegan was raped by the gang he was in charge of for years, despite the fact that he would very possibly have decided to rape Deuce and despite knowing he probably committed similar horrific acts for years.To a point, I could have tolerated almost all of this. I can deal with a lot of ugly things in books if it makes sense with the world building -- after all, our world is sometimes a very ugly place too. What I couldn't stand was Deuce's total lack of empathy for anything Tegan went through. She legitimately looks at Tegan at one point and wonders how Tegan could let herself be raped repeatedly, how she could let them and not die fighting them off -- this from a girl who grew up terrified she would get assigned as a breeder instead of a hunter in her own tribe, this from a girl who grew up small and nameless and helpless. The lack of empathy was not only disgusting but incomprehensible.To make matters worse, Stalker is a potential love interest for Deuce. He practices fighting with her as an excuse to touch her and eventually pushes her against a tree and kisses her. She kisses him back. I wanted to vomit in a hat. He called her \"Dove\" after the bird as a fucking term of endearment. He says it's because doves are vulnerable and frail looking but they can fly away from predators. This does not even make sense, seeing as Deuce does not run/fly away; she fights. The nickname takes away from everything she built herself up to be and she lets him do it. Again, I wanted to throw up.As for the lackluster world building: As far as I know, we aren't told how old Fade and Deuce are in the text, although the jacket description says 15. I believe the author was forced to play it loose by her own world building. Living to 25 in the Enclave makes you an ancient elder so one would think children would be named and assigned jobs much older. Even if you wait until they're 13 that's more than half the maximum expectation of their lives without a name, without contributing substantially to the community. Fade and Deuce don't have a listed ages within the text of the book because they were written as older than 13, but that does not fit with the world building. As far as I'm concerned the no name until you're all grown isn't practical and goes against human nature.Tunnel system mistakes: I don't understand how there are defensible/livable areas in a tunnel system, especially with clean running water 100 years after the world ends. I'm not sure how people could live down there with the diet described in the book: essentially rat meat, mushrooms, and fish. I guess that's why 25 is considered old. In reality they all would've been wiped out by disease long before this book could've taken place.Sunlight problems: I'm not going to pretend I know how a cave dwelling person would adjust to sunlight after living underground all her life, but I'm going to say that I think this was all highly unrealistic. She wears sunglasses she found and gets a slight sunburn? WTF? Those miners in Chile who were trapped underground for two months had to wear special sunglasses for almost as long as they were trapped or risk going blind. I don't think the author did appropriate research on this front, but I'm not inclined to do it for her and research out what actually would've happened to Deuce and Fade.I could go on and on here, but I don't care. All I keep doing is thinking about Stalker as a love interest and feeling sick to my stomach. I don't understand how people can find him redeemable or the storyline acceptable. A lot of reviewers I respect rated it a fair bit higher than me, all I can think is that we did not read the book the same way."}, {"userName": "karen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45618-karen", "userReview": "[ when one of the potential rapists who was a rape-enabler of others was seen as a possible love match for her. on the one hand, i can see how her character would be drawn to him - their sensibilities are very similar. she is just learning about emotions like some female terminator, and her more sympathetic love match is full of emotions that she wants to understand but isn't quite there yet. and here is this young thug who has survived as a gang leader for years, and survived as an autodidactic fighter who never needed to cultivate his emotional side - he only needed to keep his people alive by any means necessary.

Then, they broke up and The Walking Dead became the new step-parent. Giving rise to the strange child we call Enclave. Isn't she a cwute wittle one?I had this big stupid flow chart all planned out for this review, but it seems there are like a hundred reasons why it won't work. Well, more like two. Images aren't working correctly on Goodreads at the moment AND I can't find a free site to host such a large image on AND it looks like crap small. Damn. That's four reasons. I so can't count tonight.Girl15 lives underground in the Enclave after an as-of-yet-unknown apocalypse of some sort. Having just finished training to become a Huntress, she is given a name, Deuce (don't even start), and a parnter, so she can begin exploring the underground. Also falling to her are the jobs of hunting and trapping food and fighting off \"Freaks\", creatures who were formerly regular people now equipped with claws, razor sharp teeth, and cannibalistic tendencies.Deuce has the strength of Katniss, the intuition of Buffy, AND she eats zombies for dinner. Well, not really. But wouldn't that be an intriguing twist?I have very high requirements for kick-ass female characters. When you grow up with characters like Buffy and Princess Leia, it can set the bar pretty high to begin with and can result in a difficulty being satisfied with Bella-ish whiny girls. Then when more awesome iconic characters like River Tam and Katniss Everdeen come along, that raises the bar even higher.Now Duece is a pretty freaking badass character on her own. The problem is that Ann Aguirre set the bar just out of reach with her first kickass chick, Sirantha Jax of Grimspace, and Duece just isn't quite tall enough to walk in her predecessor's tiny flats and still measure up. She would need 6 inch platforms to reach the level set by Jax.Well, she got the shoes. You know what kind they are? Zombie killing shoes. I guess, technically \"Freak\" killing shoes, but they help her measure up to Jax. With them, she kicks a hella ton of ass.She sure reminds me of Katniss a lot. She is dry and detached, but she is a MACHINE. Killing machine, that is. I would have liked to see a bit of the spunk and snark that Jax is so blessed with, but they are two very different young women.The society in the Enclave was infinitely interesting, and I would have enjoyed spending more time there and learning more about it. I have sooooo damn many unanswered questions. For example: They aren't supposed to have sex unless they are \"Breeders\". Does that mean an underpants pillowfight is out of the question? Come on, we need to know important stuff like this.I would have liked more inner enclave espionage. Maybe to see Deuce and her partner, Fade, sneaking around a bit, being tensiony and sexual-ish and inciting rebellion. Then concentrate more on Topside in the sequel. This book is called Enclave after all.And yes, Deuce is a strange name for a girl, or for any person for that matter, especially since I have the tact and giggle reflex of a nine year old boy. However, the name is only giggleworthy for the first few pages and a good unique name is a necessity. My dog still hasn't forgiven me for naming her after a science fiction technological masterpiece. Which one? I'll never tell. They are all good names, anyway. ;-) The Death Star... Flux Capacitor... Number Six.Overall, I loved this! The last half is slow and arguably not as good as the first, but regardless, I'm still excited for the sequel!!"}, {"userName": "Maja (The Nocturnal Library)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4551536-maja-the-nocturnal-library", "userReview": "[Except maybe Freaks, but come on!

When Deuce was underground (at the beginning of the book), the author really took her time to develop her characters. Deuce is a soldier underground. In the beginning, Deuce does what she is told, thinks what she is told and doesn\u2019t question authority. However, it is clear to the reader that there is more to Deuce than her brutal surroundings and life. Fade, her partner, is mysterious not only to Deuce but to everyone underground. The author portrayed him as dark and dangerous but only from Deuce\u2019s initial viewpoint. I loved how Fade\u2019s true nature was so different and how Deuce learns this along the way. Fade really was a great character and well constructed.The story underground.Seriously, when the author takes her time, she writes a good story. I loved the plot when the characters were underground. The world building was great. It was simple but hey, this is a YA book.The BAD- The end and no climax-The book is 259 pages, that is it. Here is my theory; the author had something else in mind- a longer, better-crafted COMPLETE story. Someone, somewhere, decided that this was going to be a series and said to the author \u201cend this book right here since they do arrive at a location so that looks like a good ending\u201d. On the other hand, maybe, the author was under a time crunch. I don\u2019t know. In fact, I\u2019m hoping my theory is correct because I cannot plausibly explain why there would be no real climax to the story. They are moving, surviving, struggling, surviving, fighting, surviving, and that is it. They go from one location to another location and so on. I'm guessing the climax is in book 2.Character development (later in the book)-The addition of Stalker. So at this point, I think it might be good that the author just arbitrarily cut off the end of her book. Because if she was going to lead towards the infamous YA love triangle with this character known as Stalker, I would have thrown this book in a cave and sealed the book in the cave for good. Once Stalker is in the story, the relationship between Deuce and Fade all but fades (couldn\u2019t help myself). Stalker was the leader of his own gang before he joined up with Fade and Deuce. Stalker forcefully made Tegan (another character in the book) be a breeder in his \u201cgang\u201d because well, of course, that is all she is good for. She was raped. Gang-raped. Over and over again. In fact, even though the details are sketchy, I believe Tegan gave birth three times? Don\u2019t hold me to that fact but I think it was three times. This is the guy that Deuce, the soldier, and Fade, the survivor wants in their group? This is the guy that Deuce would risk her relationship with Fade for? Here is the really bad part. I don\u2019t think the reader is supposed to hate Stalker. I think the author\u2019s intentions were to make Stalker a redeemed character and in the next book (book 2 aka the 2nd half of book 1) there will be a horrible love triangle in it.OVERALL-I\u2019ve gone back and forth on the ratings for this book. I\u2019ve gone as high as 5 for the 1st half of the book and as low as 2 for the 2nd half. Because of my dislike for the 2nd half, I\u2019m forced to go with 2.5 stars rounded up to 3."}, {"userName": "Wendy Darling", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2745288-wendy-darling", "userReview": "Okay, I'm adding this note because I'm seeing some activity on this review as I'm updating my reading progress in the third book.

It's fascinating to see this society that the author created.2.5 stars I really wanted to like this book, but holy moly. I try very hard not to let my opinion be colored when fictional characters make choices I wouldn't necessarily make, but...I just can't do that in this case. The offhand way gang rape is handled, the dismissive attitude towards an abuse victim, and the sudden introduction of an inconceivable love interest (turning it into a triangle) late in the book left me cold. The action scenes and interesting premise aren't nearly enough to make up for a heroine who is physically extremely capable, but unfortunately, someone who also seems to be emotionally empty."}, {"userName": "Ceilidh", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3229028-ceilidh", "userReview": "After receiving a copy of this book from GoodReads friend Lucy, I was immediately drawn to the Publisher\u2019s Weekly quote declaring the book to be \u201cfor fans of The Hunger Games\u201d. Such comparison quotes, while attention grabbing and common practice amongst publishers, immediately set up a certain level of expectations, even in the most cynical of readers. While I haven\u2019t actually finished reading The Hunger Games yet (I\u2019ll get round to it eventually, I swear!), I began this book with the same expectations I have for every dystopian novel \u2013 strong world-building and a real threat & sense of danger. There are books that make me consider discarding use of the flawed star rating system for reviews. Sometimes it\u2019s close to impossible to summarise the qualities of a book into a simple rating out of 5, 10 or however one chooses to do so. A book can be a relatively enjoyable and competently written piece of work that would otherwise deserve a solid rating, but a certain element, event, etc, can bring its rating tumbling down. This happened to me with Sarah Beth Durst\u2019s \u201cIce\u201d and it happened with \u201cEnclave\u201d. But before I get to why I cannot give this book anything higher than one star, I shall discuss other elements of the book that succeed and fail.I\u2019m sure you\u2019re all sick of me going on and on about this but the foundations of a strong dystopian novel lie in its world-building. Unusual or disturbing events can\u2019t just happen for shock value. They need to be rooted in the origins of the society, grounded in reason, meaning the reason of this world. This fundamental lack of reason within the world-building in \u201cEnclave\u201d left more than a few questions unanswered. The underground society Deuce lives in does not name its young, known as brats, until a specific age, which is never mentioned. Why? There doesn\u2019t seem to be any specific reasoning behind this rule and seems too impractical to fit in with a world that works to prove itself as fundamentally practical. There are hints of a cult-like mentality to the ruling class of the world but it\u2019s barely touched upon and leaves us with half-built reasoning. Children are sanctioned into one of three groups \u2013 warriors, builders or breeders \u2013 yet the reasons for specific grouping once again seem at odds with the necessary practicality & needs of this society. One breeder, Deuce\u2019s friend, is seen as ideal for his calling because he is handsome, but I failed to see why this would be a relevant quality in a world where death & disease are rampant. Other extremely questions go unanswered \u2013 how does this enclave have clean water after generations underground? How does Deuce go from a lifetime underground to full on exposure to sunlight and only get slightly burned with no damage to her eyesight? The writing itself is adequate, if simple, and has well-paced action scenes, although the overall pacing is erratic. Certain scenes are evident padding and clumsy plotting, which coupled with several under-developed plot points proves to be somewhat frustrating. No character other than the heroine is given adequate time to develop beyond basic tropes, although I did warm to Deuce somewhat throughout the first half of the novel. However, it is one particular character and how others react to him that soured things for me.A little more than midway through the novel, Deuce is kidnapped by a gang who make their intentions towards her clear \u2013 they intend to use her for breeding purposes, forcefully if need be. Later we are introduced to Tegan, a fellow kidnapped woman who has been raped repeatedly and given birth to stillborn children. After altercations with the story\u2019s main monsters, the Freaks, the head of the gang, Stalker (yes, really), decides he will go along with Deuce, Tegan and main love interest Fade in order to have a better chance of surviving. Fade and Deuce agree to this, despite Tegan\u2019s protests that she does not feel safe around the leader of the gang of rapists who repeatedly violated her for years. Later on, Stalker pushes Deuce against a tree and kisses her.Deuce willingly reciprocates.I\u2019ve made my thoughts clear on the \u2018bad boy\u2019 trope in YA; I don\u2019t like it. I understand the fantasy behind being the one girl who changes the rebel but ultimately I think it\u2019s a problematic trope that is all too often used as an excuse to have the love interest treat the heroine like dirt, often being rough with her and belittling her. Patch from \u201cHush Hush\u201d held his love interest against a bed and talked about how much he wanted to kill her after stalking her, harassing her and generally making her feel uncomfortable and unsafe. Stalker is the leader of a gang of rapists. It is hinted at in the book that he has raped women before. It is also implied that he may have raped Deuce during her kidnapped period. He is presented as a potential love interest to Deuce.The aim of a good dystopian novel is to create a sense of dread. I have seen rape mentioned in other dystopian novels and within the constraints of this world where humans die young and need to reproduce quickly, it makes sense that a patriarchy dominated society would view women in such a manner. However, I have never seen rape used so casually and tossed aside so simply by a character and an author in a YA novel. There is a cruel lack of empathy for Tegan in \u201cEnclave\u201d. Even within the constraints of the novel\u2019s world, one ruled by social Darwinism, to force Tegan to interact daily with the man who stood by & let her be raped repeatedly, possibly ordering the rapes himself or even engaging in the horrific act himself, is baffling at best and disgusting at worst. As the novel progresses, Tegan grows (lazily from a characterisation point-of-view) from a victim into a \u2018strong\u2019 young woman who can fight back, but all I could think about was how her rape was used in such a cavalier fashion. Deuce, who started off with such potential (even if she did fall into the typical romantic plot tropes with mysterious bad boy Fade), does not question Stalker or his past actions. Instead, she lays some of the blame on Tegan. The dismissive attitude she has towards a victim of multiple rapes is abhorrent. At one point she asks herself how Tegan could have been so weak as to allow the events to happen. Deuce\u2019s general attitude is that life is tough, and if she can suck it up and get on with her life, so can Tegan. Even within the context of the novel, this felt wrong on every level. Deuce, who had previously shown moments of true empathy, becomes someone who sympathises more with a rapist than the victim of rape. I shouldn\u2019t even have to explain why this made me sick. And that\u2019s why I can\u2019t give this book anything more than one star.I don\u2019t expect every book in the world to be a beacon of social justice and feminism; that would be stupid. What I do expect is for a book to follow the rules it sets for itself. \u201cEnclave\u201d fails on this thanks to its inconsistent and confusing choices in its world-building, which seem to exist more for shock value than any real sense of reason. It\u2019s a mediocre novel that becomes disgusting when something as serious, life changing and horrific as rape is used so clumsily. Rape is NEVER the woman\u2019s fault. She\u2019s never \u2018asking for it\u2019 and she\u2019s certainly never deserving of pity or scorn because she was unable to fight back. Bad boys are problematic enough, but making a rapist not only a sympathetic character, one who receives a degree of sympathy from the heroine not rewarded to the victim, but a potential love interest is flat-out inexcusable. 1/5."}, {"userName": "Angela", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30035966-angela", "userReview": "HATE New York City has been decimated by war and plague, and most of civilization has taken to living in underground enclaves, where the life expectancy is no more than the early 20's.

She gets this name in a naming ceremony where the towns people gather around, place a bunch of rando items in front of you, cut your arms a bunch of time, and then whatever you bleed on first is your new name.

Stone has sex for a living and Thimble builds things. You'd think as her bff4ls that they would play an important part of this story; turns out they really don't.

Basically she runs around the underground enclaves killing \"freaks\" and hunting down other communities. She is partnered up with the not so mysterious boy Fade.

And yes, I realize I still haven\u2019t read the one series lauded as her best, Sirantha Jax, but I will get to it one of these days. Although Enclave had some great ideas, some very quotable passages, and some fascinating characters, I think it also fell short in a number of ways.This book tells the story of Deuce; a girl living underground in the tunnels and sewer systems of a post-apocalyptic New York City. She lives primitively in an enclave where you\u2019re a hunter, a builder, a breeder, or an elder. If you aren\u2019t strong, you don\u2019t survive. Even the lowest of the classes, the breeders, are still the ones who are good looking and intelligent. The weak, sickly, or stupid don\u2019t live long in this community. Deuce is one of the hunters. She brings meat back for the rest to eat and keeps them all safe from the Freaks; grotesque monsters with a never-ending appetite who live outside the enclave. Problems arise when the Freaks encroach more and more upon the enclave, and Deuce is formally teamed up with Fade and forced to find out exactly why the Freaks are attacking closer and becoming braver. Nobody likes Fade, a teen boy a few years older than Deuce who had only recently arrived at the enclave, and Deuce has to deal with enduring feeling like an outcast alongside him for the first time. Her resolve is shaken and her faith in her people and the rules she\u2019s lived by her whole life are greatly tested. It isn\u2019t until she\u2019s forced out of the enclave does she finally realize that she knows nothing about the world she lives in.Deuce was an obvious choice for my favorite character, but only because she was the most developed. She\u2019s struggling throughout the book for answers and warring with her upbringing and the rules forced down her throat, but it gets to the point where you just want to shake her. Yes, I get it, you were a huntress and important and now you\u2019re not. The world is not what you thought, roles can be reversed, and people grow up differently depending on their situation. This gets reiterated time and time again, up until the last few pages of the book. I understand that when comparing Deuce\u2019s life underground with her experiences above creates an interesting juxtaposition, but there comes a time when you don\u2019t have to tell me how different things are. I liked her nonetheless though, and she was a decidedly strong character who time and time again did what she had to do. She definitely changed from the brat who blindly followed what her elders told her to a young woman who could think for herself.The first third of this book focused on life underground in the enclave and introduced the rigid day to day activities and methods of survival that Deuce and the rest of her people live by. It\u2019s a harsh life with little to look forward to, and the rules and regulations are practically beaten into every child since they\u2019re born.I think this part of the book really set things up well; you get a sense of the dank despair the group live in and how they have their rules to keep everyone alive. If the people are allowed to breed indiscriminately then diseases can flourish, if the hunters don\u2019t train every day then they might get killed by a Freak, if you find an artifact and keep it for yourself then you\u2019re denying everybody what little culture they could have. It\u2019s a very depressing existence but it\u2019s all they know.Fade is the disturbing force in this equilibrium and it becomes obvious that he won\u2019t be able to go with the flow for very long. I wanted to like him more than I did though. He\u2019s the strong rebellious bad boy, and he\u2019s also tall, dark, and mysterious, so what\u2019s not to love? I don\u2019t know, I just didn\u2019t feel like I ever really got to know him. It also didn\u2019t help that he was barely acknowledged in the last half of the book, except to talk about how distant he had become. I also felt like the romance between Fade and Deuce didn't evolve as organically as I would have liked. I understood that their shared experiences and the amount of time they spent together and relied on each other moved their romance along faster than it would have in real life, but I still didn't believe that they could fall in love so quickly.Once Deuce and Fade left the underground, the novel rushed forward more than I wanted it to as well. I did enjoy it when they found a new relic or came across a new type of food \u2013 the introduction of SPAM in particular was funny \u2013 but I still didn\u2019t feel like enough time was spent developing this section as the time she took with the underground parts. There are two other characters introduced after they leave the enclave, and neither of them really got fleshed out enough. This book was just too short to include them and expect me to become attached. Plus, the second boy, Stalker, isn\u2019t one I could ever like when considering the circumstances he came from. The girl, Tegan, is there to elicit an emotional response as well, but it just didn\u2019t happen for me. I felt more for the other enclave citizens and friends that Deuce and Fade left behind than these two new characters.It\u2019s funny, because Fade echoed my thoughts in the end:\"Don\u2019t leave me, Deuce. I need you. I want it to be like it was, before the others came.\" (251)Me too, Fade, me too.The ending cut the story off at a point that was not very satisfying. It\u2019s the kind that makes you turn the page and wonder where the rest is, and then you realize, oh, I have to wait for the next book now. Will I be continuing on with this series? That\u2019s more than likely, but the way it ended didn\u2019t leave me with any feeling of excitement over the next installment, it left me feeling cheated out of the full story. It\u2019s a bit ho-hum and less than ideal, and hopefully the next book is developed better. I guess I\u2019ll just have to wait (over a year!) to see what happens in the next book in the series, Outpost."}, {"userName": "Steph Sinclair", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4642710-steph-sinclair", "userReview": "[lack of vitamin D, perhaps?

I was particularly excited to pick up this series because I\u2019d had it on my reading list even before I became fond of the author. I am glad to report that Enclave was every bit as enjoyable as her other books.The characters were realistic and relatable (as usual) and the world building was totally immersive. I can say with confidence that I\u2019ve never read anything quite like this book\u2026 It completely takes you into a new world filled with horrifying situations that would have me crying in a corner. What I liked about the protagonist, Deuce, is that she was every bit as frightened as I was but managed to draw on her inner strength to face it anyway. I appreciated her ability to adapt to each new situation and think for herself in a society that encourages the opposite.Overall, the book was fast-paced, creepy as hell, and retained everything I\u2019ve come to love and appreciate about this author. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing where the story goes next!Recommended Reading: this book is perfect for fans of the post-apocalyptic genre \u2013 especially those who love zombie stories (for the record, I think I'm good for a couple years in all things zombie). This book is also one that I would feel confident recommending to both men and women, which is a rare find in the heavily \u201cromanced\u201d teen section these days."}, {"userName": "Catie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1886642-catie", "userReview": "3 1/2 starsA couple of years ago, I endured read a young adult zombie novel which it seemed might turn me away from the shambling mobs forever. But then, after two years of strict zombie literature abstinence, enter the Goodreads Zombie Advocacy Board: your friendly neighborhood support group, recommendation service, and cheerleaders for all things decomposing and reanimated. So far I\u2019ve read three zombie books this year; a very small percentage, but I think it\u2019s safe to say that the healing has begun.Deuce is a teenage girl who was born in the Enclave: an underground community with strict rules and traditions. For as long as she can remember, she has wanted to become a huntress, tasked with providing meat for the Enclave and fighting back the Freaks: strange, violent, and hungry masses of mindless humanoids who appear to be getting more intelligent by the day. When the day finally arrives, she is partnered with Fade, an outcast of the community who was not born in the Enclave but has been allowed to stay because of his superior hunting abilities.This book is a thrilling, fast paced paranormal young adult novel. As with every paranormal YA I\u2019ve come across it contains a few elements that annoy me deeply (probably because I am an adult and shouldn\u2019t be reading these books). But I must say that this one is a cut above the rest. I gladly picked it up each day, and I never felt uninterested. The story will keep you riveted and alert; there\u2019s no long sections of exposition or filler here. It\u2019s all action. That made me kind of curious for a while: I really wanted to know all the details of just how the world ended up this way. But I think that she handles it very well: just enough is revealed to give a subtly clear picture of the events, without resorting to an unrealistic scene where the heroine just happens to stumble upon a complete explanation of her planet\u2019s history.Deuce is a bit annoying, but in a way that I can tolerate well. She\u2019s brash and ballsy, a little too confident in her own abilities, maybe a little too cold and calculating. Really there\u2019s nothing that I love more than a badass, arrogant heroine so we\u2019re all good there. Of course, as soon as she\u2019s in the tunnels with Fade she starts to notice his chiseled cheek bones\u2026and how surprisingly warm his hands are\u2026and how dark his eyes are. You can see where this is going. But she\u2019s sort of endearing, as a young woman who really has no experience with romance at all. So, since this is paranormal YA, I know what you\u2019re all wondering right about now. What is going to be the crazy obstacle that prevents these two from getting it on? Will it be\u2026wrong side of the fence? Species barrier? Pre-existing relationship/commitment/betrothal? Fear of rejection and failure? Dangerous magical powers? Eugenics style breeding program? Bingo! That\u2019s the one. Strangely, even with a very limited gene pool (which they are limiting even further by selecting only the \u201cattractive\u201d people to become breeders), no sunlight, and only fish and mushrooms to eat each day, these Enclave residents don\u2019t all resemble Gollum, 100 years post ring acquisition. In fact I didn\u2019t find anything too annoying in this book until quite near the end, when our heroine gets desperately confused by a love triangle, and the hero goes all sullen and mopey. I also think that it\u2019s pretty predictable where this is going for book #2. I mean, anyone who has ever read Watership Down knows that when you stumble upon utopia, you don\u2019t stick around. You get the hell out of dodge before everything goes sideways. The audiobook narrator is a major drama loving over-actor of the highest order. I mean, I know that there are certain situations that call for that kind of emotion. But when she\u2019s narrating every nap, long walk, and foraging scene as if she were Scarlett O\u2019Hara saying, \u201cAs God is my witness, I\u2019ll never go hungry again!\u201d there\u2019s a problem. If you have the option, I would go with the print version.Perfect Musical PairingFilter \u2013 It\u2019s Gonna Kill MeBecause my favorite part of this book is the heroine kicking butt and taking names, so she needs a badass theme song.

People, how many times do I have to remind you that having a good premise and combining that with sloppy worldbuilding, a teenaged protagonist, and a love triangle does NOT automatically qualify a book as YA? I managed to finish ENCLAVE, but only because the whole time I kept on expecting it to get better, for it to eventually blow me away. Well, there was definitely no blowing away: my butt remained firmly in my chair, my forehead practically glued to my desk in frustration.Good things first, I guess. I like Deuce. She belongs in the new, Katniss-esque camp of female protagonists: resourceful, emotionally reserved, tough on the outside, vulnerable and endearing on the inside. Now for the litany of issues I had with this book, i.e. Why Poor Deuce Deserved a Better Story. Where do I begin? The writing was mediocre. I felt like no sooner was a character or detail introduced then he/she/it either died, got destroyed, or became Significant, rendering all of those introduced characters and details glaringly device-y. Changes in Deuce and Fade\u2019s lives occurred with little regard for logistical backstory: when Deuce is in danger of death by Freak, a random group of dwarf-people who\u2014surprise!\u2014have been secretly living within the tunnels all along come out to save her. Deuce and Fade are cast to the surface for a tradition that, in essence, should make sense as a way that the elders enforced obedience, but, when it actually happens, feels so contrived.And that\u2019s the problem I continued to have throughout this book. Despite the promising premise, I feel like ENCLAVE only scratched at the surface of its world\u2019s possibilities. For me, a story\u2019s world has to feel like it can exist without an author\u2019s interference: the book has to read like, say, contemporary YA reads to us, which is to say that all the complexities and possibilities of the world have to feel natural. ENCLAVE\u2019s world did not feel natural to me. It felt like the author was writing in aspects of the world as the story went along, and I was left with too many logistical questions and an utter lack of investment. For example, I\u2019m aware that I was supposed to see Deuce\u2019s enclave as a stifling, cruel, and totalitarian governing system, but I never felt stifled on Deuce\u2019s behalf. Everything in this book was begging me to consider it as dangerous, as suspenseful, as intense\u2014which did not allow me to feel anything naturally, except perhaps boredom. It was just not credible.Deuce was about the only character in this book that I felt like was even remotely well developed, and I\u2019m beginning to suspect that that\u2019s just a trick of the first-person narration. Fade I felt was trying so hard to fit the mysterious-hot-love-interest quota that he ended up being very uninteresting. And OH GOD CAN I JUST RANT HERE ABOUT THE TRANSPARENCY OF THE LOVE TRIANGLE? So Deuce and Fade get into an altercation with a gang. The gang leader, who displays sociopathic tendencies towards homicide, randomly has a change of heart and joins them on their journey to find utopia, or whatever else is a better word for what they\u2019re looking for. He and Deuce hook up when she\u2019s busy agonizing over Fade. Yawn. The obviousness of the romantic elements of ENCLAVE didn\u2019t help dissuade my snarky notion that the author was trying to fulfill some checklist for How to Write Bestselling YA or something.I also think ENCLAVE took a big (and ultimately unsuccessful) risk in incorporating \u201cidea-dropping\u201d into its narration. \u201cIdea-dropping\u201d is my just-made-up term for a concept similar to name-dropping. It involves describing common modern items in such a way as to make it clear to us what the characters are describing without actually naming it, since, obviously, the characters don\u2019t know the name for it. The one other time I\u2019ve seen idea-dropping used was in another YA dystopian that ultimately didn\u2019t agree with me. I think it\u2019s a literary technique that panders to readers and doesn\u2019t add anything to the world or the characters. I don\u2019t freaking care that they\u2019re eating Spam. All I needed to know was that they were eating long expired canned food. Spam only has implications for us readers, not the characters. Thus, idea-dropping spoon-feeds the dystopian aspect of a story, but I personally find the spoon-feeding offensive to my readerly intellect. There are better ways to write a dystopian than to idea-drop.And what is up with the Freaks? Are they supposed to be flesh-eating zombies, or a mutation gone terribly wrong, or something else? Why wasn\u2019t there more of an explanation for their existence so that they would also be less device-y? And are you SERIOUS about the disembodied voice that \u201cspeaks\u201d to Deuce (or comes to her in a dream, I couldn\u2019t figure out which) and convinces her to make the right decision, etc etc? I didn\u2019t realize that deus ex machinas were so easily accepted! And don\u2019t even get me started on how Tegan is an expendable ninny who inspires no empathy and is like a girl trying desperately not to be TSTL (\u201ctoo stupid to live\u201d) but, due to shoddy writing, ends up fitting exactly that expendable role.My problem with ENCLAVE wasn\u2019t that it read like a setup for the rest of the series. Rather, I just cannot respect a story that skimps so heavily on plot, characterization, and worldbuilding. As far as the trilogy is concerned, this is the end of the road for me. I wish all brave travelers who wish to journey beyond this point the best of luck. I\u2019m going to spend my time on more well written books."}, {"userName": "oliviasbooks", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2843533-oliviasbooks", "userReview": "Post-plague, underground, dystopian fiction set in a smallish, harsh, survival-of-the-fittest society, a deserted, crumbling New York City, unexpected friendship, a hint of romance and super-gory zombies! \"Enclave\" turned out to be extremely engrossing. Although, sometimes, I was a little chicken to turn the page and find out what happened next, I craved to return to the story with a feverish intensity each time I decided to shut down my Kindle, since nourishing my body, working for my living and catching the minimum amount of sleep seemed to be a sensible thing to do, but felt oh so annoying. Do you realize how lucky I am to have once again experienced that kind of addicted rush that turned me into someone who reads on a daily basis in the first place? If you glance at my current average rating of 3.1something you maybe do. I admit, I tend to forget again and again the huge emotional difference between reading a book I like and devouring a book with zest - sticky bones, minor flaws and all. Right now I am in the middle of an unquestionably clever, worthwhile book (The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms), and I eventually want to find out how it ends, but in comparison to spending time with the \"Enclave\" consuming it feels only marginally entertaining (to me).When I wrote my original review yesterday - right on my Kindle - I thought I had to be fair and reduce my enthusiastic rating by half a star at least because of the completely unnecessary beginning of a love-triangle subplot and certain vagueness concerning the survival of a person who got dear to the socially already very deprived heroine - and certainly to me. Mainly because other books I have read would have suffered the same \"punishment\". Yet after Maya supplied me with a blog entry by the author in which she addresses the love-triangle-accusation and other reader complaints (http://www.annaguirre.cm/archives/201...) my fear for a \"Who-on-dystopian-earth-should-I-love-now\" sequel did not wholly subside, but turned into something wholesomely optimistic and made me wonder whether having a book which I enjoyed as much as \"Enclave\" really deserved to anonymously drown in the crowd of four-star-worthy books on my \"read\" shelf. My rating system is heavily depending on gut feeling and my personal enjoyment. Being fair is to my books would be a ridiculous endeavour. Another thing that helped me understand were the author's notes at the end of the book. I had been wondering how the community in the \"College\" Enclave had lost and forgotten so much of our culture and of former \"Topside\" life after a mere half century maybe. Deuce does not know about the moon, about rivers and snow, or what a zipper is, what a wedding invitation might be for, and what the material plastic is called. Aguirre explains that in her imagination only the the rich and powerful had the means to flee the cities when the catastrophe happened. So the people who survived and made the survival of the next generation possible by forming topside gangs and underground enclaves had been the underpriviledged and poor. People who - at least in the beginning - did not care about written material or about handing their offspring a sense of their species' history. It made sense to me. And the information about the long shelf-life of canned food smoothed my skeptical frown. What I still do not get is how the underground clans make do without carbonhydrates. Apart from rare finds (tinned fruit etc.) Deuce's community lives on meat, fish and mushrooms only. I know that the Enclave's ancient-looking eldests are only 25, but is the human brain able to function without glucose? I am not sure, but in the end I find I do not really care.\"Enclave\" just offered a mix that was strangely irresistable to me \u2013 personally: - A fifteen year-old girl, a huntress who takes pride in what she does, who sees the facade of her safe and perfect worlds crumble and starts to question the infinite authority of her community\u2019s cruel and insincere elders. - She gradually falls in love with her topside-born mysterious partner although she had been taught that romance was reserved for the weak and pretty, namely the chosen breeders.- Part of the book\u2019s charm is her open-eyed wonder about the sky, the moon, the buildings and the rest of our civilizations remains. - Part of the book\u2019s thrill is that she and Fade are admirably tough fighters and kill countless foul-smelling zombies out for their flesh in perfect choreography.- This likable pair acts in front of two very bleak, but interesting settings: The dark metro tunnels in which you reach the neighboring enclave only by running three days through zombie-infested territory and the toppled ghost-town of New York ruled by raping, murdering teenage boys who will die young in a fight over their territories.- The move to Topside presents Deuce unexpectedly with a real friend and with a deadly enemy turned into a valued companion.Well. That somehow does not sound convincing, I know. But how should I talk with my guts? Can you tell me?"}, {"userName": "Giselle", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4800103-giselle", "userReview": "This book, you love it, or you hate it. And then there's me.Enclave starts out as a very captivating, very exciting read. The world building is terrifying; we've got society living underground, talk of barren wastelands and acid rain \"Topside\", beasts are roaming the tunnels which, let's face it, are zombies. These \"Freaks\" eat human flesh, they smell and look like death, and they are taking over! I was lost and absorbed by this dreary desolation. Though what makes it the most compelling is the plausibility of this post-apocalyptic world. Society would separate, and there are apparently already people living in the underground NYC tunnels (as per the author's notes). These types of post-apocalyptic settings are my favorites, the possibility makes it horrifying, and you all know by now that I'm a masochist. In the big picture, the world is brilliantly imagined, sharply described, and I loved it. I also loved the slow telling of its history. We don't know what happened to bring about this future from page one, we learn it as our characters do. When you look at the world closer, however, mostly in regards to the underground living, I was a bit less convinced. How have they been getting drinkable running water for a century? Or I guess the best question to ask would be: How exactly have they survived? If you tell me you lived under the earth for over a century, you will need to give me the full lowdown to make me believe it. I wanted it to be more fleshed out. The transition from underground to Topside is also a part I wish would have been done differently. Someone who has never been exposed to the sun would not so easily adapt to it. Sunglasses, conveniently found might I add, would not nearly be enough protection. I was expecting a bigger reaction overall, not just physically, but mentally as well. Nonetheless, I will say that the world we do get Topside is very well described in all its ravaged glory. The planet is destroyed and the author depicts its bleak nature very vividly. On to the most controversial aspect of the novel. The characters in Enclave are very particular. They have an extremely different upbringing; Deuce was brought up as a fighter, a warrior, with \"the strong survive\" as her biggest value, so she lacks social skills including, and especially, empathy. The way she reacts to situations and other people's distress is a source of complaint from many other reviewers and I can easily understand these reactions. Personally, I was able to do away with my own values to understand a culture that is completely unlike my own, but it does bring about harsh topics, such as rapes, that could very well leave a bad taste in your mouth. What I certainly could not stomach was when the arrow started pointing at an nauseating future love triangle - which I was confirmed does come about in the sequel. It's not the triangle that I have the problem with, but the love interest involved in it. This is a guy who let his people gang-rape a girl continually, and who most probably raped girls himself even though it's not specifically mentioned. He is a sick, vile man. While I understand the reasoning behind wanting him on board to help them survive until they reach their intended destination, I do not see myself garner anything but disgust in the possibility of a romance between our protagonist and this dirty, rotten fella. I just can't. Will I still read the sequel knowing this? Certainly. The world building and overall premise is very enticing and I was thoroughly entertained from page 1. But it will also likely annoy and disgust me. I guess we can't win em all.--An advance copy was provided by the publisher for review.For more of my reviews, visit my blog at Xpresso Reads"}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6010839-lisa", "userReview": "My Rating: 4 StarsThis is one of those books that I was unsure about. I read through the book not really knowing what to think and by the end I thought to myself, \"what a fascinating read\". The world that Ann Aguirre creates is not a pretty one. It is harsh, full of violence and people only survive if they are strong. It is essentially one of the more dismal worlds that I have read about. I still have many questions that remain unanswered especially concerning topside, but I am confident that Aguirre will provide those answers in the remaining books of the series.What I took from this book is that it is a novel essentially about survival. The characters did everything they could to survive and because of this, the lines between good/evil, wrong/right, etc. get blurred in their struggle to survive.Deuce is someone that I respected right from the beginning of the book. She is a strong girl who is very proud of her accomplishment of being a huntress for her enclave. I loved the growth and development that we see in her character. She goes from this naive girl who took everything that she has been taught in her enclave to heart to someone who begins to see the truth of things and fights.I think the following quote represents Deuce's strength, resolve and ability to take on what is thrown at her:\n\"The two of you have to forget what came before.\" At Tegan's black scowl, I held up a hand. \"If you don't, we won't make it. You think it's easy for me? I can be safe and warm right now in my own pallet in my own space with nothing more to worry about that following orders.\"Instead I'm here, where day by day, I don't know if I'll have food to eat or a place to sleep, if I'll wake up with something trying to kill me. It's hard. And it will get harder, the farther we get from known territory. We have no idea what's out there. None. And either you're ready to start over... or you're not. No more of this. If I didn't let go of what Ive lost, I'd go crazy. I suggest you two do the same.\"\nI also loved Fade, of course! Again, the word survivor comes to mind. To me, he was the character where the lines between right and wrong were the least blurred. He was not brainwashed by the enclave and basically just trusted his instincts.My issues with the book all start when we are introduced to Stalker and his gang, the wolves (or the wolf pack). To a certain extent, I understand him. He lives in a harsher world than even Deuce and Fade. He has had to earn his way to the top with violence and copious amounts of bloodshed. Stalker is someone who thinks nothing of raping a young girl and having others rape her for \"breeding purposes\"; he is someone that kidnaps a person to use them as bait; he is someone that thinks that women are useless other than for breeding - essentially there are NO qualities about him that I would say are redeemable or that I even respected. I was fine with all of this. Stalker, like Deuce and Fade, is from a world where only the strong survive and he was just doing what he needed to so he can live to see another day so I understood him. So what is the guy exudes the same amount of human compassion that a toad would give you!What I had a huge problem with is Stalker as a love interest for Deuce. REALLY! .... WHAT!!! Here we have this guy who abandons his \"cubs\" to move on with Fade, Deuce and Tegan for survival. We see him essentially telling Tegan that she is useless over and over again. I can go on and on - blah blah! Ok, I understand moving on from one's past as was mentioned in the book. I understand that he did things that were inhumane to stay alive. BUT, REALLY... REALLY.... COME ON! Can I for once read a series where a love triangle does not come into play! I am more upset over the fact that Stalker is even being considered an option as a love interest for Deuce than I am over the fact that there even is a love triangle.There is no choice here! Fade is good! Despite the fact that he has grown up in the same harsh and volatile circumstances - he is GOOD! He looks after Deuce and when Tegan comes into the picture, he looks out for her too. He genuinely becomes sad when he losses a friend - does not just move on chalking it up to a \"that's life\". Fade is there for Deuce... period! There are not too many tenderhearted moments in this book, but one stands out for me:\nHis hands came up to frame my face, warm against my cheeks. Before he bent his head, I knew what he was going to do. Touch his lips to mine. Oh, and I wanted him to. He left me the chance to back away and break his hold. I stilled, hardly daring to breathe. The old refrain of can't and shouldn't sank beneath the weight of new words like, please and yes.This time I did wrap my arms around his neck. I met him on raised toes and melted into him. I breathed his breath and tasted the essence of him. He was the heat of a fire and the sweetness of the moon I'd only just met. No wonder Breeders were so cheerful. I thought, breathless.\"I never belonged anywhere until I met you,\" he said, resting his cheek against my hair.\nYou can not compare Fade to Stalker. You just can't! I hated the fact that Fade retreats into the background for a while. I'm still not sure of the reasoning behind this choice on Aguirre's part.Tegan was my favorite character in the book. She was portrayed as weak; however, I think she was anything but. She was kidnapped by the wolves and repeatedly raped for God knows how long. She gave birth to stillborn children. Despite this, she is not broken. She helps Deuce escape and holds her own. She may not have the physical strength and the fighting know-how that Deuce has, but she has this inner strength that keeps her going. Most adults would not have survived what Tegan has gone through, much less a young girl. I just wish she wasn't depicted as such a helpless victim. Victim - for sure. Helpless - not on your life! She was the strongest of the bunch to me.I'm still not sure how to rate this book. I'm giving it 4 stars and that is based upon my enjoyment of the story and the fact that Ann Aguirre is a really great writer. Please take my rating with a grain of salt. Although there were aspects of the story that made my skin crawl, it was what it was - part of a difficult world and reality for the people of that world!

Mind you, I RARELY re-read books - once I know the ending, it's very hard for me to truly enjoy it again. The only books I can think off the top of my head that I have ever re-read are Great Expectations (3 times), Pride and Prejudice (4 times), The Kite Runner (2 times). As you can see, only the best classics go in my rereading pile. So how did Enclave get there? Easy - it's AWESOME. I had just received Outpost and it had been over a year since I read Enclave and I didn't remember enough details to be able to read the sequel. When this happens, I usually take an hour to skim through the pages of the novel and that's enough for me. Except when I opened up to the first page of Enclave, it had an invisible magnet that drew me to the page and didn't let go. So off I went into a fantastic world with my favorite characters!Now I'm going to gripe at my friend here. This is off-topic so feel free to skip. This particular friend was also super excited for Outpost, so I offered to lend it to her. I was in the middle of a book and I still hadn't gotten to Enclave (the skim-turned-reread) and I wanted to get Endurance (Enclave #1.5) read. Here I am all done with Enclave, starting Endurance, ready and pumped for Book 2... and Taylor has not finished it yet! I have to wait until Friday! I don't think I have that kind of endurance! (Taylor, if you just so happen to be reading this, I mean this in the most friendly way - READ FAST OR ELSE!) Now onto the review.The Plot -The biggest things Deuce has to worry about while living in the underground College Enclave is earning the respect of the other Hunters, fighting hungry Freaks (big, ugly monsters), and bagging meat for her community. But after she is paired with Fade for a partner, everything goes awry. Suddenly, her support for her partner is only earning her potentially-fatal jobs, she's having compassionate feelings no Hunter should feel, and why is she starting to doubt her leaders have everyone's best interest in mind? Finding herself exiled after standing up to authority, she must rely on her partner to find a new life Topside - where she must face other dangers she hasn't even imagined.What can I say? This book has fight scenes and other enthralling moments left and right - which is PERFECT for me. It's exactly what a good post-apocalyptic should be - the quest to survive despite all the hardships thrown your way. Pure, unadulterated fun, this one!P.S. I second Rachel's motion: Kill off characters - it really works!The Setting -What sets Enclave apart from other dystopians is the amount of detail that has gone into the book, which can only come from tons of research (Aguirre mentions some of the places she took ideas from at the back of the book). Without a doubt, the setting and the people and their actions is extremely believable - I was completely immersed in this novel for this reason. Whether it's the Freaks (I'd really like to know where they come from by the way) or the way a person who has never been on ground before might view specific objects or common occurrences, every moment takes you further into the intricacies of this story and personalities of the characters.The Characters -Some of my favorite characters from dystopian stories come from Enclave. Unlike most dystopians, each character here is equal parts strong, smart and determined - that's why they've survived and so many others haven't. There are times when characters rely on their baser instincts to get them through a situation, which exposes the raw, emotional, and often grim reality of a survivalist attitude. Each character's views change and develop - they all grow to accept that they are valuable for some things and others, they are inexperienced at, and they work together as a unit to get things done. Overall, very well-crafted and compelling characters - I just can't wait to see more of them!Romanciness -I thank my stars Enclave isn't yet another one of those books that stress how much the guy is omg-hawt and how they just can't keep their hands off each other. They carry on a conversation like normal human beings, they fight back-to-back trusting each other completely, and just relying on each other for strength and comfort. That is what real love is; authors should just discover that already. There's no insta-love, no love triangle, no constantly hungering for affection - which makes the snatches of alone moments all the more beautiful. You know Fade and Deuce are made for each other and they are completely in love - not because they're always resting their heads against each other or having outbursts of emotion - no, Aguirre is much more subtle than that. You know Fade is jealous of how much time Deuce and Stalker are spending together by the way he turns away, by the way he starts taking Tegan on hunting trips. And it's all so quietly nobody notices... except us readers who are just waiting for the ultimate \"AW\" moment."}, {"userName": "Kyle", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5290637-kyle", "userReview": "[Pearl died because her house was broken into.

And gladly I didn't. The thing is I'm not a zombie fan. It was my first book from this kind cause I hate the movies. Disgusting. I know lots of researchers proved that humans can become zombies and it would have to be caused by a very rare virus or something but although they can truly happen I still dislike to watch/read (or so I thought) anything about them. Anyway, you can guess my surprise when I discovered that Freaks are truly zombies- yes, yes, it took me a while to guess- and I'm not only I'm accepting the book, but also liking it! Deuce was raised in an Enclave, where nobody is expected to live more than 25 years. They live in tunnels, under New York. She hasn't seen the sun. She doesn't even know that it exists. The elders kept them in ignorance. Taught them what's necessary to make sure they obey. Made them fear the world topside. But at least, the Enclave is safe or rather was. It keeps them far from the Freaks. The Strong Only Survives After her name day, she became a huntress. Destined to bring food to the clave. Only strong and brave brats would become hunters. So it was an honor. She was paired with Fade, the strong outsider. The only one there who has ever been in the real world. After discovering some dangerous news during a mission, they warned the elders. But they ignored them. After discovering bit by bit the corruption of the leaders, how much lying and cruelty they are doing, she can't trust them as much as she did before. Therefore, she didn't hesitate to defend her friend even if that meant exile. Fade supported her and they went to the world upside. She didn't expect what she found. Not even a bit. This book was very enjoyable, the world Ann Aguirre created was disastrous, one of the worst futures that might happen. Looking forward to reading the next book. I can't find anything related here to the Hunger Games though. I couldn't stop reading, it was fun and fast. Always something is happening, there aren't much of a useless talk and words. I would like to see some more romance between Deuce and Fade in the next book, although it was good in this one."}, {"userName": "kris", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2125614-kris", "userReview": "Let me be frank: I wanted to like this book. The premise sounded interesting, even though it's yet another dystopic young adult novel. Halfway into this book, I was tempted to give it up, but I kept pressing on. A bit farther, and I thought I could see the light at the end of the tunnel--the situation was getting more interesting. By the end of the book, however, I was livid, disgusted, and annoyed. Ignoring all the poor world-building, the horribly card-board-like characters, the handling of sex and violence--all the things that would make this just another subpar ya dystopia--let's focus on the really disgusting bits.Namely, the love triangle (and subsequent handling of rape). How do I put this mildly? Deuce, the main character, cannot decide between Fade, the soulful loner who gets himself exiled to help protect her, and Stalker, the \"former\" gang-leader / rapist of the fourth member of their party. How is this even a real decision. The fact that it's left nebulous and up in the air is horrifying. The fact that Deuce views said fourth member of their party--Tegan--as a weakling who \"let\" herself be raped is even more disgusting. The fact that any of this is presented as \"okay\" is just sickening. I could go on (and on) about all the other poor choices made in this fad-hopping book, but I will leave it. I don't think I can stomach any additional thoughts about it."}, {"userName": "Mizuki", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16842102-mizuki", "userReview": "2.5 to 3 stars, I'm okay with this book and I'm surprised the story isn't as awful and ridiculous as I've recently experienced with the other Young Adult dystopian novels (Legend trilogy by Marie Lu, I'm looking right at you). Well, the world building does leave many things to be desired, we only know civilization as we know it had broken down sometime ago (a couple of decades ago, or within the last 100 years, I guess?) and now humans are living underground in different 'enclaves' to avoid the dangerous flesh-eating mutants. Supposedly there had once been some serious plague outbreak in the past, leaving small groups of survivors (no one seems to be able to live to age 30 anymore, mind you) in the dark and struggling to survive.Obviously the setting is nothing original, but at least I can appreciate the main characters for being down-to-earth survivors trying to find their way out of bad situations instead of heroes who is going to save the human race. I can only hope the author would keep up her work instead of turning her story into silly teenagers' romance/love triangle like so many others before her, I can tell there's a romance underway, but still I hope Ms. Aguirre won't do that to us all. *sighs*Plus I'm not okay with how the character Stalker and his behaviors are treated in the book, although I understand the world is in bad shape now and rape and viewing women as 'breeders'/sex slaves might be brushed off as 'survival of the fittest' by the men (e.g. Stalker and his gang) who lived above ground, but the heroine Deuce......she's from an underground small society in which raping women Is Not Okay, so it's disappointing to see her just brushing the rape issue off as well (especially after she befriends an enslaved girl and nearly got raped herself). And then...Stalker, the gang leader who obviously doesn't mind raping and enslaving women when he sees fit, just...reforms himself later?

To be honest, the amount of Dystopian YA\u2019s being published bores me. Every one of these YA\u2019s are being courted as the next Hunger Games just like a few years ago with every single YA with vampires, fairies or fallen emo angels was the next Twilight. Ann takes some interesting chances with Enclave, and this is not for the weak of heart. Nothing is sugar coated here. The first half of the book gave me a claustrophobic feeling while reading. Unfortunately the second half faltered because the action wasn\u2019t as intense and Ann falls back to an all too familiar trope found in present day YA- the evolution of a love triangle that will most like appear in Outpost, the second book in this series.Have you ever seen the movie, 12 Monkeys? Enclave (Razorland #1) is a YA version of that film. Enclave takes place sometimes after the second holocaust of the Earth. Humanity has suffered immensely from some unknown catastrophe that has occurred. (Most likely an atomic World War III). We\u2019re introduced to this world through the eyes of Girl15 who becomes Deuce on her naming day, her birthday. Deuce lives underground and has never gone up to the above. Upon further reading, I would say Deuce lives in the former subways of New York City. Everyone has a role in the enclave and Deuce\u2019s role is to become a Huntress. She will hunt for food in the tunnels. Deuce lives in a dark and dank world both literally and figuratively. Disease is rampant and hygiene is not the best. Some women are solely used to breed children, known as brats, while others keep their fortress strong and safe from the Freaks. Freaks are monsters who feed on the flesh of the living and even themselves. They roam the tunnels looking for their next meal. Hunting for food can be dangerous, but Deuce is strong and fast. She is partnered up with Fade, an older boy who came from the above when he was a small child. Fade is not well liked by the elders because of where he has come from and has the makings of being a troublemaker. The elders make sure the rules are followed with an iron fist. If not followed, they have no qualms in exiling those who don\u2019t behave. Exile means certain death.Deuce and Fade soon figure out that the Freaks are not the mindless creatures that only exist to eat that the elders think them to be. And because of that everyone is in danger. Fade is more than willing to break away from this near like prison community and move on, but Deuce is scared because the enclave is all she has known. But then Deuce something unselfish to save one of her friends, and she is exiled. Fade goes along with her and they go up to the above where a new fascinating world of danger awaits them. Deuce and Fade don\u2019t only have to worry about the Freaks, but roaming gangs that will kill without warning and use women as their own playthings. And when Stalker, the leader of one of the gangs, targets Deuce and takes her, Fade will put his life on the line to save Deuce. They\u2019ll try to find a place where they can be safe without the fear of starvation and targets of the flesh hungry Freaks.Enclave has a great atmospheric feel to it. I was right alongside Deuce as she fights for her own survival. The sounds, scents and mind numbing fear are strong. Fade is a great partner for Deuce and they both bounce off of each other very well. These two are the strongest and most well rounded and dimensional characters here. That became one of my main problems while reading. Characters come and go without any real meaning of substance. Because the story is so centralized on Deuce and Fade, everyone else pales in comparison. I couldn\u2019t connect or sympathize with anyone else because they came across very flat as the paper they were written on.When Deuce and Face go up above, that\u2019s where things go downhill. In the enclave, everything was wonderfully descriptive. In the above, we\u2019re given a quick overview. Deuce and Fade spend most of their time running and finding food and shelter. That is until a gang right out of Mad Max (done YA style) finds them. They meet an abused rape victim named Tegan, who has been at the mercy of the gang run by Stalker, a nasty piece of work. But then at one point either Ann or her editor came to the conclusion, we can\u2019t have Deuce happy with just Fade and we\u2019ll make Stalker a bit ambiguous in his actions so he can be redeemable and a possible future love interest for Deuce. That is where I grew weary of the story. We\u2019re told from Tegan that Stalker is a killer and most likely a possible rapist who may have raped her time and again. But then at one point Tegan changes her story and says Stalker only handed her over to the other men and never touched her. So, Stalker, who again is most likely going to be a love interest for Deuce in the next book, isn\u2019t such a bad guy because he didn\u2019t actually rape Tegan, but only gave her untouched to his men to share. Sorry, this doesn\u2019t make him redeemable in anyway and I would hope Deuce will realize this and stick with Fade. Or perhaps in Outpost, Stalker will become the ultimate villain Deuce or Fade must battle. If so, I\u2019d be very interested in seeing how that goes down and hope Ann doesn\u2019t fall back on the classic, let\u2019s redeem the near psycho and amoral bad boy so we can see that the world can be a wonderful place again because love from the heroine has set everyone free.Enclave should appeal to those looking for something different with their Dystopian YA\u2019s they\u2019ve read. If the first half of Enclave continued that way to the very last page, then I would have considered Enclave one of the best books I read this year. Overall, it\u2019s a solid read that could have been so much better."}, {"userName": "Keertana", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7584700-keertana", "userReview": "Enclave is amongst the few dystopian novels that has actually received a level amount of praise from practically everyone. As far as I know, there are no \u201chaters\u201d of Enclave, although there are those that feel simply ambivalent towards the novel, and as such, I went into it fully expecting to love it. Much to my disappointment, however, not only did I not fall in love with this novel, I couldn\u2019t even bring myself to finish it. I was less than hundred pages from the end when I came to sudden realization that I simply did not care. Thus, this book is sadly joining my pile of DNF novels. In theory, Enclave is a book I should have loved. We have a kick-ass heroine, an enigmatic young hero/romantic interest, and a unique dystopian world. Yet, everything was simply lacking in some manner or the other. What struck me first about the story was its lack of world-building. I\u2019ve already mentioned that Aguirre has imagined a fantastic new realm, only we don\u2019t know all that much about it. Of course, we are given details of the inner workings of this utopian society and are introduced to the \u201cFreaks,\u201d or zombies, but we are left completely in the dark as to the origins of this world. It isn\u2019t a huge qualm as far as world-building qualms go and while our protagonist herself didn\u2019t know the answer, a few theories as to how the Freaks came to exist or the manner in which the utopian society was formed would have been enriching to say the least. Nevertheless, my true qualm took place in the shape of our protagonist, Deuce. Deuce is kick-ass, sweet when it comes to young love, fierce when it comes to fighting, and loyal when it comes to her job, but that\u2019s all she is. Either than a couple of adjectives \u2013 strong, brave, kind \u2013 Deuce isn\u2019t made up of much. In my eyes, she never had any real substance and I was unable to understand or connect with her as there wasn\u2019t a person there to understand in the first place. It\u2019s difficult to put into words, but more than just a lack of connection with Deuce, I couldn\u2019t care for her or see her perspective on certain issues. Furthermore, this extended into her romance as well, making it all just fall flat for me. Yet, the last straw in this novel was the love triangle. I thankfully didn\u2019t make it to the point where this issue became an obvious forefront, but from skimming through other reviews, I can tell that it\u2019s distasteful at best. Not only does it continue on in the sequel (turn-off much?), but it also centers on a former rapist. (I have no right to judge in this instance, however, since I haven\u2019t seen how Aguirre deals with this issue and it CAN be dealt with very effectively, as can be seen with Melina Marchetta\u2019s Lumatere Chronicles.) Nevertheless, with any mention of a love triangle, I am usually running in the opposite direction and that, combined with the lackluster romance already present and my lack of feeling for the characters or their world simply resulted in a novel I couldn\u2019t bring myself to continue. Yet, I haven\u2019t quite given up on Ann Aguirre. I hope to read (and love!) her adult Sirantha Jax Series soon for as an author, Aguirre\u2019s writing leaves little to be desired. Unfortunately, I simply seem to be the black sheep when it comes to this novel and, considering I\u2019ve read too many dystopians, utopians, and zombie-related novels lately, I\u2019m just hard to impress.You can read this review and more on my blog, Ivy Book Bindings."}, {"userName": "Peep (Pop!

As it stands, I downloaded the audiobook from Audible and listened to it while performing the most mundane tasks at work. Audiobooks are awesome for making a dull girl\u2019s life a little less dull. The audio for Enclave was great. The narrator (Emily Bauer) wasn't too boisterous but neither was she timid in her delivery. At first, I thought she sounded a little young and maybe a bit chipper, considering the type of story this is, but her narration really grew on me as the story unfolded.The novel was plainly awesome. However, it was never out right touted as a zombie novel, and it is never expressly stated that the unnatural monsters roaming the remnants of a doomed Earth are zombies. But, after a few chapters, it\u2019s pretty obvious that this is yet another Earth ravaged by a debilitating disease that somehow allows the dead to continue to walk the planet, feasting on the flesh of humans. Gross, yeah?But the story focuses on those that fled this disease, the ones that live underground, and have created their own little world, below the plague-ridden surface. There\u2019s the strong heroine, the huntress. And, of course, her strong male-counterpart, who challenges her every move. They are partners in the hunt, to provide for their Enclave and to protect it. And this works for them. Until they are forced to question the actions and motives of the elders in the Enclave.I like the story. I like not being explicitly told what led to this devastation, these horrible circumstances. I like not having the whole plot spelled out for me. It\u2019s hard not to note the similarities between dystopian/post-apocalyptic novels, but there\u2019s something about this one. Normally, I just passively dismiss how the post-apocalyptic setting came about. But with this novel, I want to see the prequel\u2026the events that led up to the separation, the ones who fled underground and those that stuck it out on the surface. I\u2019m intrigued by Fade and fascinated by Deuce. I want to know more of their story. They\u2019ve got a lot of discovery left in their futures, and I can\u2019t wait to read more about it.
