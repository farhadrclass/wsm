This one is not perfect, but definitely gives a good insight into the life of a very unique and very troubled woman."}, {"userName": "Steve", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3094832-steve", "userReview": "Mid 3. Detailed and informative, this biography charts Monroe's tragic story and provides great insights from her beginnings as Norma Jean. Yet, at times this is too traditional a biography in its structure and doesn't really capture the screen icon and sex symbol's allure."}, {"userName": "Inessa", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1234808-inessa", "userReview": "best biography about the life and legend. the intimate details make it worth every second... great for those who aren't even a fan."}, {"userName": "Elaine Duree", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/855179-elaine-duree", "userReview": "I learned Marilyn was a woman who was confused about what she wanted.
