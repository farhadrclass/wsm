Why did I love this book?\" It is one of those things I really should not have enjoyed as I did. There were no huge dramas, conspiracies, or epic adventures. In fact, most of it was simple conversations or private thoughts of the heroine, just everyday life. There are many bread recipes for crying out loud. And I loved every second of it. My friend Mel gave it to me to read after I got my heart thoroughly broken. Shattered, actually. She said that she reads this book every time that happens. She even takes notes and jots down personal thoughts in the margins. I followed suite. It was like therapy. I cried, empathized and was startled with how many things the heroine was thinking and feeling that matched where I was exactly. It is written in a very comforting, cozy way. It makes you feel a little safer and secure as you go through it. Although my broken heart was still in that state when I finished this novel, I did feel like I had experienced some solace. Even if you do not have a broken heart, this book is excellent, but if you do: Pay for the overnight shipping!"}, {"userName": "Melodie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5788507-melodie", "userReview": "I really enjoy what I call foodie fiction.

We had intended to use them as kindling (though yes, burning books is very Fahrenheit..whatever).It was the dead of winter in an uninsulated cabin, what can I say (except that, trust me, books don't give much heat when you burn them).Anyway, I read the books, all of them, before they went to their dreadful end. And I discovered that there were about 6 plots in all 300 books.So, I think maybe there are around that many in the realm of chick-lit also. At least Bread Alone seems to go through the expected paces. You have the heroine, suddenly alone and coping with the infidelity of her rich and handsome husband (who is such a shlump, though a pretty one, that one wonders why she hooked up with him in the first place. Maybe it was the colored contacts). You have the secret passion of her youth (though at barely past 30 she is still pretty young), put aside for marriage to contact-guy. You have venture to a new place, where suddenly opportunity presents for her to reclaim the passion (not sex, mind you, but bread..and the descriptions of bread are far more erotic than any of the sex in this book). You have the cute fixing up of the new but temporary rental. You have the tough best friend, the assortment of minor but interesting characters, the complicated daughter/mom relationship, and the sexy guys vying for attention. And the very very predictable ending.So hey, it wasn't the best work of literature ever written. But it was fun, and the recipes tucked throughout sound very delicious. So sure, I might look for more books by Hendricks."}, {"userName": "Jennuineglass", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8228847-jennuineglass", "userReview": "Every now and then you come across a book that feels like it was written just for you, for this moment in your life. This is one of those books. It was like Ms. Hendricks lovingly wrote me a novel, years ago, where it waited all this time until I finally pulled a used copy from a dusty shelf in a second-hand store to be read when I would most strongly identify with her story. And I did.This novel was a Seattle foodie love letter and I ate it all up in one sitting because it had all the things I love (bread, men, friendships, a strong female lead, and Seattle....not neccesarily in that order). She spoke of streets I have walked, restaurants I have been too, ferries and freeways I have traveled and did it with such clarity that it was like being home. She also did something that I love in my foodie books...sprinkled the story with actual recipes (did you leave out one ingredient or step Ms. Hendricks in the tradition of old?). Yes I was thoroughly engaged with her well developed characters and their plot lines, but just as inspiring was the baking knowledge I learned; such as what goes into making breads, how to make a chef (yeast starter), and I also learned that you should clean a wooden rolling pin with dried flour, not wash it. Did you know that fellow foodie reader? The whole book is peppered with such interesting culinary details. These details are seamlessly woven together with an engaging story of a woman who struggles with finding her identity when what she thought was is taken away. I will warn some readers that it does have a lot of feeling and emotion, but I wouldn't call this a \"romance\" book.If you love foodie books, and especially if you are from Washington, read this book. Happy Reading!"}, {"userName": "Alexandra", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7149304-alexandra", "userReview": "This book was so hard to get through. The first half of the book (seriously about 100 pages) is boring and nothing really happens. Wyn (short for Wynter, which is her middle name) is dealing with a failed marriage. And she mopes. And acts selfish and self-centered. That doesn't change for the entire book. She is not a likeable character. She's not strong, she doesn't really do anything to make her stand out. Was I supposed to feel sorry for her? Was I supposed to be rooting for her to find love again and find a better life? Because I really didn't care what happened to her. And by the time I reached the end of the book I realized I had known what would happen all along.I finished the book only because I kept hoping it would get better and it never did. It didn't help that I never learned French and there is a lot of French used in this book so some things just went right over my head.

Nothing earth shattering or original happens in the book. It's simply a book about life. The main character, Wyn, is basically thrown out of her husband's home and life. She moves in with a best friend in Seattle to try to re-coup. She takes a job baking bread and starts to grow.What I loved about this book (besides the baking and the recipes!) was that it was about family, friends, and growth. Wyn is a sensible, loving woman who makes friends easily and is always there for those friends. Baking bread is her catharsis. Bread becomes a metaphor for her life as she grows and \"bakes\" along with her career.\"Bread Alone\" is a simple read, but an enjoyable one. It made me think of the people in my life, and what I am contributing. When I finished the last page, I wanted to do two things: bake bread, and go call my family.I give this book 5 stars for thoughtfulness and for the wonderful journey it takes you on. *****"}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1710557-amy", "userReview": "Read June 2008, and at the time wrote:Nice weekend read.

The descriptive prose was engaging, at times humorous and in addition created a real sense of involvement with life in a bakery. Even bread-making recipes are included from time to time. The main character Wynter (Wyn) takes us through all her trials and tribulations as she endeavours to cope with events which almost overwhelm her. Her relationships with family, friends - including her best friend ever and work associates become very strained and I gained much satisfaction from the book as any outcome(until the end) was unpredictable.

Bread Alone was presented to me as a good example of developing a central female POV character, as done by a female author. It showed me what I shouldn't do with my heroine.Wynter is a 32-year-old Hancock Park trophy wife who gets dumped by the cheating rich spouse, weathers a series of mostly self-inflicted misfortunes, then finds fulfillment making bread in Seattle and bedding a tall-dark-and-handsome bartender. Other than the recipes, that's about it. It's not a category romance, although it could easily be mistaken for one at times; it's not chick-lit in that there's very little shopping or fashion porn, but it's just down the street a little from there.I enjoy a good heroine and make sure to put at least one strong, smart woman at the center of each of my works. In that regard, Wyn was frustrating for me; she starts out whiny and self-involved, gets way worse, then suddenly becomes a sassy smartaleck about 3/4 of the way through. Wyn's best friend CM is the blunt, protective, take-charge Best Friend from countless romcoms, but for all that she's the more sensible and least irritating of the two. I'd rather the story had been about CM.Except for the tall-dark-and-handsome bartender, all the men in Bread Alone are creeps, losers, or both. The last time I felt such a need to apologize for my Y chromosome, I'd just read a Cosmopolitan magazine.If it sounds like I'm a bit put off by this book...I am. Not because of that pesky Y chromosome, but just the opposite. The old-school feminist in me rebels at the thought that a female writer, writing for female readers, will create a heroine whose major accomplishment is to stop shooting herself repeatedly in the foot and start acting like an intelligent human being. If that appeals to you, go for it. If nothing else, you'll have the recipies."}, {"userName": "Jody Paglia", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24347810-jody-paglia", "userReview": "This book is a must read for anyone who has had to reinvent themselves after being deserted by a spouse.

She digs deep within herself as she finds solace in the menial task of baking bread. The story is filled with recipes and illustrations of the bread making trade, both with her current job and those based upon her earlier life during an apprenticeship in France.She undergoes a catharsis and much introspection regarding her prior willingness to give up all that once was dear to her to follow a man that clearly was not worthy of her. She realizes that her once charmed life was based upon lies and that the quality of a man seldom is reflected in his bank balance or in the fancy car he drives.

Not because of the story but the recognition that there is a large volume of women\u2019s fiction out there that is just not for me. I\u2019ve started to read several women\u2019s fiction books lately, especially those that have a foodie angle. What made me sad was that for many of these books written by women for women, I just couldn\u2019t get myself to like the protagonist. Yes, of course I wanted the main character to get what she wanted, but there was no passion, no emotional attachment as the reader, just an unattached hope she'll find what she\u2019s looking for eventually and that the book will end quickly. It seems that most women\u2019s fiction books these days are built on one thesis, and one thesis alone. Woman wants man. Lots of things crazy happen in between. Woman gets man. The protagonist may go through emotionally wrenching feelings towards the latest man around her or conflicted feelings about the many men around her. There may be deep reflections on what she really wants in a man and more crisis and drama along this same vein. That\u2019s it. (Spoiler Alert) In this book, the woman does not want to come to terms with her lying, cheating husband, tries in vain to win him back from the \u201cother evil\u201d woman, and then turn him around and force him to love her again. This defies logic. At least to me. If her own husband, who had promised to love her and shares their daily life together (even though it may not a happy one) shows no ounce of integrity or care, then why does she not stop for a minute to reflect about his character instead? He cheated on her, lied to her, hid things from her including his income, and controlled her lifestyle. Yet when he rejects her, she pins for him and persists, with her own mother encouraging her to \u201cwin him back.\u201d When he refuses and kicks her out of their home (leaving her belongings in the driveway, no less) and she suddenly finds herself single, she becomes an emotional wreck and goes to great lengths to secure another man, to the point that she even sleeps with her own step-brother (yuk, yuk). I usually read two books at once. The other book I read during this time was by Tim Cahill. He, on the other hand, took me on a thrilling journey. A journey of a man who was determined to see the world, who wanted to reveal the secrets of the Inca and save endangered sea turtles. He regaled me with stories that made me sad, happy, but most of all, he stimulated my curiosity and increased my knowledge of the world around me. Wow. Then I flip back to Wyn from Bread Alone who is so desperate from her loneliness that she sits in a bar alone crying, with no clue of what her she wants in life, feeling sorry for herself that she can no longer wear the best designer clothes or live in the best neighbourhood in the city, and then gets busy plotting revenge, trying to make her soon-to-be-ex-husband\u2019s life miserable by delaying the divorce as long as possible. How can I empathise or root for someone like this?I know I shouldn\u2019t generalise, but I have to ask. Why is that the only thing every woman I read about does is pin for love and then manipulate her way to get the man she wants? Is that her only goal in life? Her raison d'\u00eatre? Then I pick up my other books and read stories about men who scale mountains, travel to Siberia, feed orphans in Africa, dive in the deepest of oceans, brings music or some other gift to an inner city school, all the while falling in love with a beautiful girl. What joy it is to read these books. So why can\u2019t we read more about women who do the same, because I know there are many wonderful smart, funny female adventurers, social changers, fun loving, world travellers in real life. Why can\u2019t we have more stories about them, these women with strong desires to make a difference in their communities, their world, who may use their skills to solve mysteries, discover crimes, or rid the world of some evil thing, while at the same time falling in love with the handsome man next door? Yes, give me the cute, flirty love scenes and the hot steamy sex scenes, but also please give me some women of substance I can root for. I finally finished this book, struggling through every chapter, waiting for something material, something I could hang my hat on. As hard as I tried, other than the recipes, I just couldn\u2019t get myself to like it. I see great reviews for this book, so I wonder if this is just me. Is this what is expected of female protagonists, of females in our modern world? The bread recipes sprinkled across this book were great and is the only reason I will keep the book."}, {"userName": "Wendy Kendall", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36480823-wendy-kendall", "userReview": "Reading Bread Alone will give you that same warm and peaceful feeling you get the moment you catch the scent of newly baked bread.

Every novel I have read about how a woman copes when her marriage ends has ended in the same way, so no surprises there. But other than that this is a very good book, very readable, and almost pornographic in it's descriptions of bread. Oh how I wanted to eat some of the bread that she was creating!I particularly like the turns of phrase in the book. I'd quote an example, but I have left the book upstairs. The experience of the woman in this book is fairly true to the experience of women suddenly abandoned by their husbands, though her recovery is much quicker that it would be for a real live person. And, it has to be said, this woman has lucky - new friends drop in her lap, perfect job opportunites open for her, the few men she has the opportunity to meet fall at her feet - but who would want to read a novel about a real woman? It would be about sobbing into her pillow for a year, losing friends, struggling to find work, darkness and depression. Not very entertaining.

The baking was very appealing to me, and I enjoyed the descriptions of the process immensely."}, {"userName": "Amber", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5896561-amber", "userReview": "This book reminded me why I need a good foray into chicklit every now and then. While Bread Alone will not be a candidate for the Pulitzer, it was an easy, nostalgic read on a snowy weekend. Be warned though, you may find yourself eating large quantities of baked goods, longing to drink champagne with your best friend, craving Van Morrison tunes, and flirting shamelessly with blue collar men."}, {"userName": "Rachell Lewis", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1161951-rachell-lewis", "userReview": "I felt bad because my boss loaned me this book with such regard, and I just couldn't get through it. It's based mostly on a woman going through a sudden divorce, and I really could care less.

These visits bring back memories of her apprenticeship at a French boulangerie, when her passion for bread-making nearly led her to leave college to become a baker. Once again the desire and ambition to bake bread consumes Wyn's thoughts, and when offered a position at the bakery, Wyn quickly accepts, grateful for the comfort of a routine.Arriving at the bakery just before midnight and working long hours among the bakery's cluster of eclectic women \u2014 Linda, the irascible bread baker; earth mother Ellen and her partnerDiane; Tyler, the blue-haired barista \u2014 Wyn awakens to the truths that she missed while living the good life in Hancock Park.
