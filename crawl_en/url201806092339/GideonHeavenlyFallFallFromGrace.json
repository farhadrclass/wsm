It\u2019s unlike anything you\u2019ve ever read before and so worth your time in reading. Well written self-contained story that\u2019s very entertaining to read."}, {"userName": "Eniko", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8492498-eniko", "userReview": "AUDIOBOOK editionAn interesting and unexpected take on supernatural.

It was an interesting twist on the typical paranormal romance. What happens when one of the good guys gets bored with being a good guy and wants to let his inner bad boy out. While the book didn't grab me immediately as some of Sharon Hamilton's books often do, I'm glad I stuck it out."}, {"userName": "Debbie  Victorino", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60387645-debbie-victorino", "userReview": "AmazingI fell in love with this book.

I was intrigued, I love Ms. Hamilton\u2019s military romance series and was excited to see her take on a completely different genre. Gideon is a darker, violent and more sexually explicit book than the SEAL\u2019s series in my opinion.I think fans who enjoy PNR are going to enjoy Sharon Hamilton\u2019s unique spin on this genre. Gideon is suspenseful and definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat and there\u2019s no cliffhanger! I can\u2019t wait to see where the series goes from here.JD Hart narrates all Sharon Hamilton\u2019s books and it\u2019s no wonder, his fully voiced productions are a marvel and this one is no different. The sound and audio production are done to perfection.This audiobook was gifted to me exchange for an unbiased review!"}, {"userName": "Karin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5272374-karin", "userReview": "Fall From Grace Book One.Gideon is the only one of his kind - a vampire turned angel.

Persephone is sent by her Father to guard Gideon and keep him from fully turning dark. When she sees a dark shape whisk away Gideon's chosen lover, she wakes him and warns him of the peril.

Your heart breaks when you hear how miserable and lonely he is. I loved his tales of mischief. He has you laughing out loud. The detail of the scenery is amazing, I felt like I was at the vineyard.

I have to say it was not what I expected but I was pleasantly surprised as the story continued. The concept that even angles can make mistakes made the characters more real and made it easier to relate to the human feelings they displayed during the course of the tale. I really wanted to dislike Gideon as a character, but found I did understand his anger and resentment. I did not agree with how he showed his displeasure but could relate to his acting out. Persephone seemed like an odd match to our much more worldly Gideon, she was sweet and na\u00efve and I felt like the Father was setting her up to fail when he sent her to find Gideon. Theirs is not the usually love story, boy meets girl and falls in love, it is definitely going to be a work in progress but it was worth the read. I volunteered to review this story for my honest opinion."}, {"userName": "Karlee", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37837136-karlee", "userReview": "Gideon is a once human turned vampire then saved by a guardian angel. Being a hybrid vampire angel, the Supreme Being wasn't sure what do to with him so he placed him as a watcher. After many years of this, Gideon became bored and decides to fall from grace. The Supreme Being sends Persephone, the angel that saved him before to try and save him again. After the two fall in love, they have many hoops to go through wether it be fighting the underworld or Gideon's maker herself before they can live peacefully together. But will they ever get that chance? Loved this story and really thought it was neat with what the author did with Gideon's character. You don't see that type of a paranormal being ever, well you do as separates by not as hybrids.

I liked this story. It was a tiny bit slow in the beginning, took a little to get into it but boy howdy, when it did start rolling... it was off to the races. HahaI'm a huge fan of Sharon Hamilton, and I love meeting new characters. I love Angel stories and with the mix of craziness she brings into these characters lives, you just get wrapped up in the story. Or I do anyway. Gideon is an angel but not just any angel, he's a vampire/angel hybrid who happens to be a guardian. Tasked with keeping the suicidal humans from jumping to their deaths on the Golden Gate Bridge. But, after 60 years atop the cables, he's bored, hungry and he needs to get laid. Like, seriously, he's a typical man there. When he causes mayhem, kidnaps a woman and then turns her into his willing bed buddy.... well things go topsy turvy. He's assigned a guardian, and not just any guardian... no, he gets to look into he eyes of the woman that \"saved\" him and made him an angel. To say he's not pleased to see her is to put it lightly. If not for the supreme being's protection, she'd be so meat. But.... as with anything in life (real of not) things happen. Now, Gideon and his guardian are on a mission. One that will lead them to the Latrell's of their lives, and back again. Darkness falls upon them and the only way to survive is to fight. Together they have to make a difference, thing is, they have to be able to stay alive, not lose faith and... believe what's before them is real. Escape means freedom, that freedom will lead them to an eternal love."}], "description": "Gideon's Fall From Grace comes after one too many boring days atop the Golden Gate Bridge as a Watcher.

At first he just wants to escape. But later, he wants revenge from a heartless Supreme Being and his angelic minions for having ruined his immortal life.
