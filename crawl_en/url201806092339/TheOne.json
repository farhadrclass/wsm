The only character who acts in a straightforward manner is the stepfather. Thank god for him. Brenna prefers to suffer in silence and accepts anything thrust at her \u2014 the girl has no pride or self-respect. And, dang, she\u2019s stupid. Jase also prefers to suffer for fear that he might suffer, and he makes others suffer as well. Then there\u2019s Miriam. Her character is so two-faced, but I don\u2019t think she knows it.How useful that Leigh uses third person point-of-view so we know how each of them\u2026sob\u2026suffers. Although it doesn't help explain to me why it\u2019s better to definitely suffer than to take a chance that you may suffer later?If one person owns 40% of something, doesn\u2019t that mean it\u2019s 40% theirs?The StoryBren has been in love with Jase for thirteen years\u2026and has never acted on it.

Poppa Jason, a.k.a., Jason Samuels IV, is her loving stepfather, who had married her mother, Lillian, fourteen years ago.Jase Samuels is Poppa\u2019s gorgeous player of a son. Miriam Dallas is a war widow who was hired as Jase\u2019s assistant. Gina had been Poppa\u2019s first wife. The Arrow S is a ranch that has been in the Samuels family for generations.

Stacey is Brenna\u2019s best friend, and James Mayer is Stacey\u2019s jerky uncle.The Cover and TitleThe cover is simple with its white background. A gradated blue banner crosses the top with the publisher\u2019s imprint in white. The main attraction is Jase\u2019s naked upper body in profile with his too-muscled bicep flexed, as he glances out at us through the angle of his bent arm.

Even Poppa Jason, Jase\u2019s father could see the love and heartache in her eyes. Brenna was young, beautiful, and oh so innocent\u2014she caught this reader's heart with her soul aching need to be loved by only one man: Jase Samuels. Seeing her heartache and being sympathetic to her fear, I was rooting for her through the whole story. Poppa Jason was a crafty old goat. He's only found in the first chapter of the book but he made a big impression on me and kept me smiling with his not too subtle pushes to bring Brenna and Jase together. His last push came with his death and the reading of his will. Jase is like most alpha males in his \"he man\" actions and inability to communicate effectively with the opposite sex. I didn\u2019t know if I wanted to hit him or kiss him but I did enjoy watching him work out his love life. Ms. Leigh was one of the first erotic romance authors I read and fell in love with when I discovered eBooks. Her unique imagination and luscious sex scenes make her stories worth reading over and over again. Even though The One is a short story, it does not lack in the heat department so I would recommend this one for those days at the pool where you can take a dip when things get to warm. One thing I was surprised to see were editing errors. However, they were not enough to take away from the story nor would they prevent me from looking for the next Lora Leigh book. Definitely a sizzling naughty romance with all the bells and whistles that kept me entertained to the end. Maybe not my favorite book of hers, but still an enchanting tale and a nice addition to my library."}, {"userName": "PepsiGirl", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6433330-pepsigirl", "userReview": "I should only give it two stars.

It started as a crush, and then matured into the love of a woman for a man. While Jase, on the other hand, lusted and cared for her, he thought to protect her so he kept her in the sister category which means hands off. Tired of waiting and watching, by chance on Jase's birthday things go a step further and get a little hot and bothered between them. Once he is able to think again without a lustful mind he backs off and Brenna goes back to life as she knew it at college. Now she is back home to fulfill a part of a will and she must deal with the pain, love, and lust she feels for Jase . But jase is battling the same lust and growing feelings.Ok, anyone who knows me knows I love Lora Leigh. When I saw this, like all of Leighs work, I had to have it. I just needed to get my smut fix like only Leigh can give me at times. My first thought when I saw the price was wow a bit steep for a short read, but I still bought it. As for the book I actually enjoyed it for a short. I bet it would have been even more amazing if it was longer. I loved Jase cause he had my emotions all over the place about him. One minute I wanted to yell at him, the next I wanted to hug him for that tender side he had toward Brenna, but he had a guard up so he didn't get hurt. The sex was hot. Brenna is great too, except I would have been happier to not have her on the verge of tears or crying too often. I'm used to the leading ladies of Leighs to be just as strong and fierce and confident as the males. I loved her loyalty to do what she had to ensure the farm would stay with Jase even if that meant months of heartache and pain. It showed strength and a bit of backbone. And yet with all that being said I still read this short in one sitting and didn't want it to end. I will always be a fan of Lora Leigh and if you pass up the fact of the price and the leading lady is on the verge of tears a lot it's a good read. Filled with love and hot sex, just how I like it."}, {"userName": "Francesca the Fierce (Under the Covers Book Blog)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3108364-francesca-the-fierce-under-the-covers-book-blog", "userReview": "This review was posted at Under The CoversIt's kind of hard to give an accurate rating to such a short story! I think I finished this one in about an hour and a half. However, after that short period of time I might've needed a change of panties! LMAO The story is set basically on a farm, Jase's family farm. His father had married Brenna's mother and basically raised Brenna as his own, even after her mother died. But Jase never really saw her as his little sister. He has wanted her since she turned eighteen, but always held himself back. Now, after his father's death, she is forced to come back to the ranch for the summer as a clause on the will so she could turn over the ranch to Jase. She has had feelings for him one way or another since she was 10. He's always been the one for her, and she waited for him to notice her. But she's been rejected by him one too many times and want to close that chapter in her life forever. But as soon as she comes back to the ranch sparks fly immediately between them, and he can't deny any longer his hunger. There is nothing else happening in this story. It is extremely short. So just look for it to give you a few heart palpitations."}, {"userName": "SirenBookReviews", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4926598-sirenbookreviews", "userReview": "Being a long-time fan of Lora Leigh\u2019s work it was a real treat to get to review the story of Brenna and Jace. The emotional turmoil that surrounds Brenna tugged at my heart strings and even brought a few tears to my eyes as the book went along. While the tears were flowing for the broken heart she harbored, somehow she kept letting Jace back in, even though more pain was sure to come her way. There were points when I was almost angry at her way of bending to his will too much, but as the story went along everything made sense and the pain in the beginning was worth the pleasure in the end. The characters of both Jace and Brenna literally came to life in my mind as the story began, being able to see the story unfold in my mind, just made this story that much better.Having read several other works by Lora Leigh, the HEA in this story was along the same caliber as her other works and left me with a sense of completion that all the loose ends had been tied up. The romance genre is one where I can tell Ms. Leigh is quite comfortable, and while I have read several of her more erotic works it\u2019s her contemporary romances that really keep me drawn in.

This is a semi cruel hero type to me. Because while he says things to hurt her, in the end poor guy is trying to protect himself from future heartache. IDK He's a conundrum. Liked the chick; she spent a lot of time in her room in tears, but really with the length of the book, a little hard to convey her hurt without it so I regress. My main reason for the only 3 star rating was the price of the book. I understand she is popular, she sells well. I also understand a lot goes into a book. Buuuutttt this one was way too short for its 7 dollar price tag. I will gladly pay that for a well written large novel. Heck ive paid 12 and 16 dollars from some of my fav authors.
