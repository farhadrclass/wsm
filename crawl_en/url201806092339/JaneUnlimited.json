And there are girls kissing.\nIf that summary doesn't excite you at least a little bit, this shouldn't be your thing and also don't talk to me. But if that sounds cool? You are going to love this. Jane Unlimited is a far departure from the fantasy Kristin Cashore has written before, but it's got her trademark strong characters and clever plotting. This book is basically a masterpiece of creative storytelling. Jane Unlimited is split into six sections: an introduction and five stories, each one following Jane through a different paths and a different genre. Kristin Cashore is an absolute master at tying different clues and hints of a story together into one compelling mystery. This book instantly reminded me of her earlier book, the equally well thought-out Bitterblue, yet better paced. While Bitterblue was undeniably a bit of a slog, brilliant as it was, this book gets going even faster. I loved seeing every little thread get tied together over time. And while each section is clever in its own way, the true strength of this book is seeing how each section ties together: all of the weird reveals are true throughout the book, and you can tell. \u2654 THE MISSING MASTERPIECE - Agatha-Christie-style mysteryThis chapter is interesting and builds up the rest of the book very well. Also, Ivy and Jane are adorable. \u265a LIES WITHOUT BORDERS - spy thrillerAgain, builds up the rest of the book very well. I liked the buildup of characters here a lot. Kiran's character especially got to me. \u2654 IN WHICH SOMEONE LOSES A SOUL AND CATHERINE FINDS ONE - paranormal horror As an individual story, I loved this a lot, though I do think it's slightly unfitting for the book itself. This one is terrifying. I want to give points for the terrifying nature, but I want to take away points for the odd and unfitting nature. \u265a JANE, UNLIMITED - speculative sci-fiThis is probably my favorite individual story; it's so meaningful it could probably stand on its own. I can't say anything because spoilers but oh man, Jane and Ivy and Ravi and Kiran and Patrick and... everyone. I just love these characters so much. \u2654 THE STRAYHOUND, THE GIRL, AND THE PAINTING - portal fantasyThe introduction to this chapter is so awesome once you finish! Honestly, my favorite part of this was the ending. I don't mean this as an insult to the novella; it's creative and interesting, although very weird. But the ending fits this book so perfectly and made the whole story worth it.What I loved most about this book, aside from the reveals, were the dynamic side characters. Tu Reviens is home to a host of odd ducks.\u27bd Our main character Jane, our slightly quirky and completely hilarious bi lead\u27bd Twins Ravi and Kiran, the children of patriarch Octavian with his first wife Catherine.\u27bd Their missing stepmother Charlotte, a character who's hard to pin down \u27bd Ravi's girlfriend Lucy and Kiran's boyfriend Colin, who are... actually cousins. Imagine being someone's brother-in-law's wife and their actual sister at the same time. I honestly don't know, buddy. \u27bd Kiran's old flame Patrick, a servant of the house \u27bd Patrick's sister Ivy, one of my absolute FAVORITES. It sounds confusing, yes, but these characters are so individually compelling and mysterious that it's easy to fall in love. I'd read an entire book about almost all of the side characters.In terms of complaints, I basically have a couple complaint - the weird labeling conversation around Kiran. I feel like the author was possibly trying to parody the lack of labels used in queer books, but calling a character \u201cpanoptically\u201d attracted is a really weird way of saying it. Maybe edit that? TL;DR: After around five years of waiting desperately for Kristin Cashore's new book, this didn't let me down at all. I don't know how talk about a book that's so close to perfect. No way did I get through this review without going all over the place; this is one of the most weirdly good books ever written. I definitely have to recommend this one to any fans of Kristin Cashore. With clever twists and brilliant plotting, it's a must-read.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube"}, {"userName": "Cece (ProblemsOfaBookNerd)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5138611-cece-problemsofabooknerd", "userReview": "*4.5/5This was a bizarrely delightful puzzle box of a book and I enjoyed every second of it.Part Gothic mystery, part choose your own adventure, Jane, Unlimited is full of more stories than should possibly be able to be contained in a single novel. Jane is feeling lost in the world. Her beloved guardian aunt recently died, and she's dropped out of college, which leaves her drifting. She is grieving, and doesn't know where her life is going to lead her next. And then she gets invited to Tu Reviens, an island mansion, and she is faced with a choice that will drastically alter her life, no matter what decision she makes.From the very beginning, I knew this book would be special. It is unbelievably odd, but fits together so many stories in a way that is always unexpected. With each choice Jane makes, she is thrust not only into a different version of her life, but also into a different genre. From a fast-paced spy thriller to a psychological horror story to a science-fiction adventure, each version of Jane's life is absolutely unique. And the most impressive part is how they all fit together, how you can see details from each different choice carried across the stories. They read as individual concepts, while also being detailed and layered enough to see the connections between them. I think my favorite was the second story, \"Lies Without Boarders\", but I really feel like every story has something completely unique to offer.The most striking element of this book is Jane. She is processing grief, trying to figure out where her life is going next, and reconciling her relationship with her aunt. She's creative, and has a passion for making unusual umbrellas. She's also branching out and trying to make new connections through the entire book. Some are platonic and some that are potentially romantic. There's just so much to Jane as a character. And the side characters are also all incredible! My favorites are Kiran, Jane's old tutor, and Ivy, a girl who works at Tu Reviens and is a love interest for Jane. But while these two are my favorite, this book is absolutely bursting with other fascinating side characters.I think the thing that pulled me in first was the fact that it is, on occasion, effortlessly nerdy.There's a conversation in the first section about favorite companions in Doctor Who, little asides about Harry Potter, and Ivy is mentioned as having a Lord of the Rings ringtone on her phone. These little moments endeared me to Ivy, and later to Jane as she is thrown into various situations, usually while she's still wearing her TARDIS pajama pants. There's so much more I could gush about, like the fact that the beginning feels like you've been dumped into an Agatha Christie novel, or how well the different story threads about art are threaded through the book, or Jane having a crush on another girl and it's just so normalized that I could cry. Not only that, but her being attracted to a man is also mentioned but that in no way leads to a story about questioning sexuality. Jane likes Ivy. Jane also maybe kind likes Ravi. I was utterly captivated by how sexuality was included without ever being made a central theme. Of course, if you know me as a reader, I live for sexuality being the main point of a story. But to have a bizarre, gothic, adventure novel and just let the main character be effortlessly queer? It made me hope for the future of YA.I just absolutely loved every part of this book, and I can't wait to revisit it in the future. It is definitely a book made for rereading."}, {"userName": "Samantha", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10067920-samantha", "userReview": "3.5 stars! I loved the first 60% of this book. But it's not as if the ending is bad, it's just that this book is a series of stories within a story and I preferred the earlier stories. As such, this feels like reviewing a mix of a short story collection and a novel, with my star rating being the average of all the stories. This is such a creative premise though and one I would recommend going in fairly blind to and seeing how you feel.

Just like \"Bitterblue,\" this novel spends too much time on the main character running around and puzzling at everything weird that's going on. It's frustrating and tedious. But a lot of librarians love it.

She goes to stay with a super rich friend at a mansion on an island because she promised her aunt if anyone ever asked her to go there she would say yes. There's a whole host of odd characters there and something sketchy is definitely going on with disappearances, art thieves, spies, and other token elements of mysteries. Jane decides there's something to figure out (??) and Nancy Drews her way around the weird house while drawing a list of suspects. She also makes a ton of umbrellas. I really don't know how to explain this plot, but it got quite creative!I love quantum physics, so I was excited about the Limited Dimension vs Unlimited Dimension idea with portholes and a multiverse. But the way everything was executed in the last 30% with pirates, alternate selves, holographs, and some seriously random stuff didn't totally work for me. It felt kind of dropped in or not used to its full potential...So I did like this story overall, but it also got rather drawn out with all of Jane's wandering around the house. It felt like most of the time was spent building up to something that never quite happened. And I love stories that get super odd or throw in magical twists, but this just didn't pull me in as much as I wanted. I did like the side characters, though! Ivy was great.Otherwise, there were a ton of Winnie the Pooh references and a few parts totally felt like the 50th Anniversary episode of Doctor Who! So that was fun. The story also felt similar to Unearthly Things by Michelle Gagnon (a modernization of Jane Eyre) and reminded me of The House of Mirth at times. So maybe check it out if you liked any of those. This would make a really neat tv miniseries!Thank you to the publisher for sending me an ARC."}, {"userName": "hpboy13", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6427364-hpboy13", "userReview": "Kristin Cashore\u2019s Graceling was a thrilling YA fantasy when it debuted nine years ago. And I was perfectly happy to stay in the Graceling realm for Cashore\u2019s next two books, where she continued to show off her chops at YA high fantasy. But there was a different sort of excitement for Jane, Unlimited, Cashore\u2019s first foray outside the Graceling Realm, and her first book in five years. I fought tooth and nail to get an ARC at BookCon, and it was the first book I read out of my 30-plus pile of books from the convention. And\u2026 oy vey.If I\u2019m being wholly honest, the only reason I finished this book is because of a loyalty I feel to Kristin Cashore. Surely, I thought, the book would get better eventually! Surely, there would be a point! Nope. It just kept derailing further and further.In the book, Jane is an umbrella artist, grieving the death of her Aunt Magnolia. She\u2019s invited by a friend to a very fancy mansion, full of curious goings on. And once she gets there and is introduced to everyone\u2026 there are five versions of the second half of the book.Cashore states in the acknowledgements that this book was originally conceived as a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure book, and Cashore boiled that down to a single choice. First of all, without getting into the details of the book, this format just doesn\u2019t work. None of the five endings are developed enough to be wholly satisfying. It\u2019s annoyingly repetitive. And there\u2019s really no reason to read five endings to the same story \u2013 I thought that perhaps there would be payoff when one of the endings introduced a multiverse, but nope, that didn\u2019t connect with the other four endings at all. The book didn\u2019t even attempt an If/Then style narrative about how choices lead us down different paths. I can\u2019t help but feel that this book could have been a compelling linear narrative with multiple subplots, instead of five half-baked narratives.Then there is the narratives themselves. They start out pretty reasonable \u2013 the world of art thievery, then the world of espionage. But then they become so absurd, it pretty much devolves into crackfic. Murderous demonic houses! Aliens! Talking dogs from alternate worlds! It honestly felt like Cashore was trolling me for the latter half of the book, until I remembered that this was actually going to be published and people would presumably pay money for it. Which I can\u2019t recommend anyone do.In terms of the characters\u2026 most of them are pretty underdeveloped. Cashore gets lots of bonus points for diversity, both racial and LGBT. But is it so much to ask that diverse books be halfway decent? Veteran YA readers will enjoy seeing the clich\u00e9 quirky YA male love interest as a woman \u2013 all the boxes are checked, from a meet-cute to the verbal diarrhea, complete with a quirk that\u2019s presented as adorable but is actually irritating. (She is thinking of scrabble words when people are trying to have a conversation with her.) But beyond the novelty of the gender-swap, many of the characters are far too trope-y to be interesting.Honestly, I\u2019m shocked at just how bad this book was. But to my fellow Graceling fans\u2026 temper your expectations, and hope the next one will be a return to form."}, {"userName": "Jessica \u2741 \u27b3 Silverbow \u27b3 \u2741 Rabid Reads-no-more", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10336538-jessica-silverbow-rabid-reads-no-more", "userReview": "I think I'm reading my new favorite book."}, {"userName": "Sana", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26402455-sana", "userReview": "My favorite reviewer, Elise, said this is her favorite book about girls kissing and how can I not read this, is the real question."}, {"userName": "Rachel Reads Ravenously", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14514998-rachel-reads-ravenously", "userReview": "4.5 stars   \u201cPeople tell you that what happens to you is a direct result of the choices you make, but that\u2019s not fair. Half the time, you don\u2019t even realize that the choice you\u2019re about to make is significant.\u201d  Jane Unlimited is the story of a college dropout, still grieving the death of her beloved aunt, who accepts an invitation from a family friend to stay at her estate Tu Reviens. Before Jane\u2019s aunt died, she made Jane promise that if she ever was invited to Tu Reviens, she must accept. And so Jane embarks on a journey to a new place filled with people she doesn\u2019t know.Once Jane is inside Tu Reviens, she is confronted with a choice, between five different options. From there, we see what happens with each of those choices, and how something so simple can alter the course of one\u2019s life.  \u201cI feel all over the place, like my parts are spinning away.\u201d  I read the acknowledgments at the end before I started the book and I am so very glad I did. In them Cashore wrote that this book originally began as a choose your own adventure novel, and I feel that provides a lot of insight into how this book is structured. I can only imagine that this book must have been a beast for Cashore to write, because there are so many intricacies and important facts to remember and she pulled it off so, so well. First off, I really want to commend the writing in this book, from the very beginning it felt like I had stepped into a classic novel, along the lines of Jane Eyre or Rebecca. And well, it fits the theme of those classics a bit with the orphan coming to the manor. The book did start out a bit slow, but I reminded myself that Graceling did as well, and I knew once I got the hang of things it would flow, and that\u2019s exactly what happened. I devoured this book, finding it very hard to put down.I also fell in love with each and every single one of the side characters, honestly I wish they all could get their own novel, or at least a novella. But this really is Cashore\u2019s strong point in her writing, I felt the same way about her Graceling series, every character became precious to me. I loved the first half of this book, to the point where this was going to be one of my top favorite novels. Then I read the second half of the book and while it wasn\u2019t bad in any way, it was extremely\u2026\u2026.. odd. To explain the structure a bit, we get our introduction to this world and the characters in it, and then the rest of the book is split into Jane\u2019s five choices, but told as five different stories. I loved the first two stories, I felt they were phenomenal. The third, fourth and fifth\u2026. Were a bit beyond me and not was I expected. One of them was downright terrifying, and the other two were bizarre. Not in a bad way, but I really wasn\u2019t expecting those aspects in this book. I wouldn\u2019t say it took away from my enjoyment of this book, but what was a five star read went down to a four point five if that makes any sense.   \u201cI\u2019m finding that despite everything, I\u2019m glad to live in this universe.\u201d   ARC provided by the publisher.

It's like a choose-your-own-adventure book, which is a really interesting idea. I like weird. You know what I don't like? Bad writing, contrivance and stereotypes.First, the writing:I don't like third person present to begin with, but that wasn't my main problem with it.\"She\u2019s as relieved as she is ashamed of herself. I hardly know her. It\u2019s none of my business what she does or whom she does it with and I shouldn\u2019t be sneaking around spying on her. What is wrong with me?\"Look, I don't usually care about the show, don't tell rule, but one thing you should never do is redundant writing. Show or tell. Don't do both? I also don't like direct transcription of thoughts in first person when the rest of the book is in third. I think it's lazy, but that may be a personal preference.After the introduction, Jane, Unlimited splits up into five parts:\nThe Missing Masterpiece\n (mystery)This one felt like a weakly-plotted hymn to American bad taste and entitlement.Tou Reviens is a mansion made up of pieces of other houses and artwork from around the world (sometimes legally obtained, sometimes stolen).Let's take stuff from other cultures/countries and mix it randomly, like gelato on pizza! Too much, all together, isn't that perfection?Americans.(Jane always mentions the Venetian courtyard of the house. Many Americans are obsessed with the ultimate tourist trap Venice, they love Italian art. They just hate Italians. More on that later.)And then, artwork that wasn't supposed to be there in the first place starts to disappear. Well, I didn't care.The plot of this one was weak: the ending is contrivance + contrivance + pretentious conversation about umbrellas. Jane congratulates herself because she was able to \"put together the broken pieces of the mystery\".She literally saw the thief while they were stealing.\nLies Without Borders\nThis one started out cheesy and then also managed to make me angry. Congratulations!An Italian family is suspected of having ties with the Sicilian Mafia (because of course, Americans) when it's pretty obvious that's not what is happening.And then:If you take someone with an Italian name, have them break the law, then make them disappear, then add the words Sicilian Mafia, everyone loves to talk about it, but no one digs very deep into where they went or why. It\u2019s not fair to Italians, but it\u2019s effective.Thank you for the xenophobia, book. That's... that's not how you subvert a stereotype. It's easy to make Italians seem part of the mafia, it's easy to make mentally-ill people seem dangerous, it's easy to make gay people look like predators. That doesn't mean you should use it as a plot device in your book and then handwave it with \"it's unfair but life is that way\".And then, that character also tells us that she has friends in the Sicilian Mafia.Am I supposed to be on your side? Because I'm not.\nIn Which Someone Loses A Soul and Catherine Finds One\n (paranormal)In this one, the house may be absorbing people. It didn't absorb enough of them.I mostly skimmed this one, and only one (minor, maybe) thing stood out to me.I'm an underwater photographer. I've been one for years, it's a really time-consuming hobby. Aunt Magnolia is an amazing underwater photographer, but it's only a cover! She also does other time-consuming spoilery stuff. I want to know her secrets, or have stronger suspension of disbelief.Jane tells us that Aunt Magnolia is really brave: she's not scared of poisonous squids (which do not exist, octopuses are not squids) and she's not scared of giant clams (which cannot move, they can only open and close. Of all the scary sea creatures, why giant clams? Who knows.)\nJane, Unlimited\n (portal sci-fantasy?)Probably wanted to be sci-fi, felt like a fever dream. I skimmed almost all of it. I think this was the one with the f/f couple, and I didn't see it, but at this point I didn't care.Also, the \"\"scientific\"\" part in this story was ridiculous. I don't know if this was meant to be a remarkably unfunny parody of bad sci-fi or was just bad sci-fi itself, but honestly? It was trash either way.\nThe Strayhound, The Girl, and the Painting\n (portal fantasy)I kind of liked this one, but it was far too late. I just wanted the book to be over.Jane, Unlimited was one of my most anticipated books for the second half of this year.

I was delighted to see that there is a new one on the horizon for fall of this year. The book, titled Jane, Unlimited, has very little description to recommend it. That said, it's become one of the most sought after books of 2017 on pure hype alone. I understand very well, because I, myself, both read and adored Cashore's previous trilogy, including Graceling, Fire, and Bitterblue. I have been looking forward to something by her since I read an arc of Bitterblue back in 2012.A few weeks ago, a very plain, very unadorned advanced copy of the book showed up at my work place. I took it home immediately and began to read it almost as fast. Two nights ago, I finished the book, and I have been trying to frame my thoughts around it ever since.It starts with an ordinary girl named Jane; a young woman newly aggrieved by the death of her beloved Aunt Magnolia; an animal photographer attempting to save the oceans by raising awareness. Jane is eighteen and does not know what to do with her life after the tragedy. She makes umbrellas for fun and has kissed both a boy and a girl. She has dropped out of college, unmoored and directionless by the death of her aunt.When a friend, Kiran Thrash, invites Jane to her home, Jane reluctantly agrees. Tu Reviens is not an ordinary place. It is a sprawling estate, luxurious, foreboding, and not without its own secrets. Upon arrival, Jane meets a host of characters who reside there; some family, some caretakers, and some who just happen to be about. You have Ravi, Kiran's twin brother, their father Octavian, who is reeling from the recent absence of his wife, Charlotte, who left him. There is Kiran's partner, Colin, and Ravi's partner, Lucy, a woman who solves art thefts. There is Patrick who works for them and his sister Ivy, who fascinates Jane. There are the Okadas, Philip and Phoebe. Then there are the mythical Panzavecchias, who everyone mentions frequently, though in absentia.Everything is going well until suddenly two famous pieces of art go missing. That is when this novel kicks into gear, and when we discover what is really at stake in Tu Reviens.Jane, Unlimited is, at its core, a mystery novel, a whodunit in a very classic way. However, it is also a Science Fiction novel, a Contemporary Fiction, a Spy Thriller, a philosophic Coming-of-Age story, and a bit of a Romance tale packed into one book. There are six distinct parts to the book and, surprisingly, you get six different types of book within. Ultimately though, it begins with a quandary - who stole a Vermeer painting and a Brancusi fish sculpture? Where it diverges from the formula into other genres is in the unraveling of the case itself. Instead of giving us a traditional linear format, Cashore works out-of-sequence and solves the mystery for us up front. She then provides detailed information in a series of revealing sequences that fill out the story afterwards. As such, she sometimes repeats information that disorients the reader, making them feels as if they have lived this life before, been there and done that. However, every time she does this she also adds a new element that feeds into the overarching plot and takes the book in a totally new direction both in structure and in feeling. It takes some getting used to. In fact, it took me half the book before I really had an inkling that this was what she was doing - that she was playing tricks on me, repeating herself, Groundhog Day-ing me.This method of revelation defies tradition. Instead of happening upon clues and building up the case, Cashore works by subtraction, giving us scenes ahead of schedule that never feel forced. Typically, I myself am not the biggest mystery fan, as I find it very easy to solve things as the details are collected. In this case, my attention was kept because I didn't have that formula to rely upon any longer. She kept changing things about and reinventing how the info was presented. This simple twist allowed me to wander through this mystery naturally, to come to terms with it and put the pieces together in a very different way. It broke the mold for me in a way that I, granted in my very limited mystery reading experience, had never seen before. I don't know that this has been attempted previously, but the fact that I have not seen it yet made it new and fresh. I couldn't stop reading, and I have not been in that head space for some time - that I had to keep reading to find out what was happening.There is, of course, a reason for everything. There is a catch to Tu Reviens that makes it special, that makes this novel special, and magical, and transcendent, but I can't tell you why it is. If the cat is let out of the bag, it ruins the entire novel. Believe me when I tell you to avoid all spoilers possible and just immerse yourself in this book. It's a very odd book, one that requires devotion, but it's very worth it. You will feel like it's not what you want it to be, and yet it's an immensely satisfying book.But, and here is a fair warning, it's extremely character driven, and you have to make it through the first hundred pages to get anywhere. I anticipate that this may frustrate some readers.Lest you feel like I have not said enough, here are a few images from the novel to whet your interest - a room of opened umbrellas, a night's chase in a bay, scrabble words with high points, a painting that you can reach through, two kidnapped children, a young man with graying temples, Winnie-the-Pooh, underwater photography, an ongoing Beetles play list, a lovable basset hound and his strayhound counterpart, an Edith Wharton novel, lovers on the outs, a gunshot wound, Unlimited vs. Limited, elaborate art ruses and heists, a fateful ride in a dumb-waiter, mafioso connections, the reason little black dresses were invented, UD17, sea bears...I could go on and on and on.Jane, Unlimited is not your average novel. It's defiant in that it won't meet any of your expectations, so it's best to remove any before you open the book. It's a lovely novel about the power of space and time, and the many layers that occur between close-knit family and the friends they keep. It is a multi-dimensional thrill ride with unique and varied worlds to explore. And, when it comes down to it, it's about a young woman name Jane - grief-stricken, rudderless, and barely coping - and seeing if she makes a successful go of it. It's unique, unlike any book I have ever read, and I won't forget it any time soon.5 out of 5 stars.- review courtesy of www.bibliopunkkreads.com"}, {"userName": "Stacee", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7359586-stacee", "userReview": "I loved the premise of this and I know so many people love Kristin\u2019s other books, so I was interested.

But since it doesn't come out for a few months, here's what you need to know. 1. Jane has recently lost her Aunt Magnolia, who raised her for most of her life. Her aunt once told her to never turn down an invitation to the glamorous island mansion Tu Reviens. Jane has also recently received one such invitation.2. This book is everything I wanted Choose-Your-Own Adventure stories to be when I was young.3. There is a dog named Jasper and he is The Best. 4. This book will make you think more about umbrellas than you ever have in your life. And that's a good thing. 5. There are some marvelous LGBT elements to the story. 6. I wasn't enamored with the cover when I first saw it but now that I've read the book, I love the cover. 7. I want to make a TV miniseries out of this book.8.

I LOVE the Graceling trilogy - especially the latter two books, Fire and Bitterblue. But IMO, this book is kind of a hot and unlikeable mess.For starters, let me say that the structure is really, really cool. It's an amazing premise. Tu Reviens is awesome and complicated, the book starts out well - I sensed promise for the characters and complications in their interactions.But oh my God. The weirdness and surplus of strange detail way, way overwhelms the book, to the point that a) I didn't care about a single characters (and, in truth, really detested spending time in Jane's head) and b) the plot structure, which could've been a major star in the story's functioning, fell by the wayside. It was also irritating because you could practically feel the book thinking that all its odds and ends obsessions were interesting - when in fact they detracted from what might've been far more interesting, actual characters to invest in and brilliant, clever plot structure.Forgetting that, the stories themselves, if they had been read in isolation, were for the most part irritating and tiresome.I have been waiting eagerly for this book for, like, six years, and was so sad about how much I disliked it.

Kristin Cashore established herself as a bonafide genius of young adult fantasy writing with the outstanding \"Graceling\" and \"Fire\" but she's positively transcended this (and every other) universe with this whimsical, wonderful coming of age fairy tale that somehow manages to be a spy thriller, a multiverse traveling sci fi epic, a truly chilling ghost story, a sweet love story, and a fantastical journey to a magical other world all in one book. They say we are defined not by who we are but by what we do. If that\u2019s true then every single decision we make from what side of the bed to get out of to whether to say yes to a marriage proposal has the potential to completely and irrevocably change the course of our lives and maybe the course of the world. In the world of Jane Unlimited it\u2019s a very small decision that will send somewhat eccentric, shy umbrella maker Jane careening into interdimensional portals, into illicit romances, through haunted libraries, and smack dab into an entirely different world depending on who she decides to start a conversation with at the enchanting (and very possibly enchanted) estate called Tu Reviens. This haunting, haunted mansion sits on its own island far out to sea and its inhabitants, a motley crew of the wealthiest of the wealthy and their mysterious, not at all super suspicious staff of servants, may hold the answers to the disappearance of Jane\u2019s beloved aunt who\u2019s last words to Jane were a plea to travel to Tu Reviens for the answers to \u2018everything.\u2019Tu Reviens. You come back.And so Jane does, again, and again, and again, cycling through just a few of the seemingly endless possible lives that might result from such a simple, small choice. Each story is more fantastic than the last but all are tied together by faint but vital threads. Finding those points of connection is delightful because it grants the reader just a taste of how truly brilliant Cashore is as a writer to pull something like this off.The book is a technical marvel even without the wonderful writing, fascinating cast of characters, and astounding attention to even the smallest details. That it is also a breathtaking, joyous, astonishing read is nothing short of extraordinary.Cashore's wonderful gift for quippy and clever but never corny dialogue is well in evidence as is her virtuoso level skill as a world builder, she is the absolute queen of giving the reader just enough to see everything perfectly in the mind's eye with just a tad left to the imagination. She writes Jane so effortlessly it feels at times like you\u2019re reading an autobiography, she\u2019s that real. I'm honestly a bit in awe of what she's pulled off here. To write a story that has so much honest emotion and such believable characters flying through the most fantastic scenarios and worlds is really, truly amazing. This is a book I'll read and read and read again knowing there will always be something new to find in its dizzying worlds and twilight kingdoms. It's at once a true fantastical epic and a sweet, simple story that I dearly hope many, many people read."}, {"userName": "Kayla", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46938598-kayla", "userReview": "Hey Ya'll!Stop by my blog to check out my full spoiler-free review of Jane, Unlimited by Kristin Cashore.https://gracelingaccountantblog.wordp...\nHighlights:\n--> 5 Stars--> F/F OTP--> Kristin Cashore's first book since 2012!--> Incredibly well-written and well thought out.--> The idea for the book is that after a certain point the book breaks off into 5 separate possible endings, and each story is based off a different decision the MC makes at a point in the story.

Anyone who knows me knows that Kristin Cashore's Graceling and Fire rank among my favorite books of all time. Which, coming from someone who reads as voraciously as I do, is saying something. Needless to say, I've been excited about Jane, Unlimited for quite awhile but I confess that I'm at odds about how I feel about this book. On one hand, Jane, Unlimited made me feel like a child again. It gave me back that feeling of childhood reading where every page is a surprise and, because you've read so few books in your life, all of the plot threads are plot twists. I felt amazement and awe and sheer wonder. In a sea of rather predictable YA stories, Jane, Unlimited stands out for being truly unique. It's a novel that, after a rather hefty opening, breaks off into five separate stories--each caused by a different choice our protagonist, Jane, makes--and in each multiverse, Jane solves a different aspect of the puzzle of Tu Reviens, the mansion her recently-deceased aunt made her promise her she would visit if she ever received an invitation. Whether it be a mystery of stolen artwork, the Italian mafia, physics or lore, I thoroughly enjoyed each new facet of the novel that was revealed. Cashore has carefully plotted and written this book, ensuring that all the pieces fit together, for the reader, by the end. Unlike other multiverse books which can become cumbersome through repetition, Jane, Unlimited sets up a common base with its opening chapter which allows the consequent multiverses to avoid repetition, picking up from where we left off and diverging quite thoroughly. The characters, too, never become predictable from having known them in previous multiverses, which is another testament to Cashore's writing. Truly, they feel believable while maintaining their unique quirks and oddities and I unexpectedly found myself caring for them. Jane, especially, is endearing--grieving, trying to find herself both sexually and emotionally, and immensely intelligent and talented. I was never frustrated with her for being obtuse and overlooking major clues in this mystery; she's a protagonist who would have acted as any independent, strong-willed young woman would do. Yet, I will say that while Cashore's debut and sophomore novel are close to my heart, Jane, Unlimited is not a novel I necessarily want to re-read. The ending is ever-so-slightly unsettling, only because each version of Jane lives a truly different life, and I've found myself confused as to how I truly feel about this book. I enjoyed it, certainly, but I didn't love the characters or plot. I think it's incredibly unique, especially in the YA genre, and I whole-heartedly recommend it, but I did want more from Cashore after waiting all these years for her next release. Jane, Unlimited is a whimsy of a tale, more akin to Sarah Rees Brennan or Jaclyn Moriarty's writing styles than Cashore's. It's an impressive feat, that Cashore has managed to write such an original novel in a completely different style or genre from her previous works--and a good book, at that, too. Compared to her character-driven novels of before, it's the plot that shines here--its sheer unpredictability and fun--but I find myself missing those deeper connections to characters that I'm used to from Cashore's work. Certainly, we see many facets to these characters and I found myself caring for them, but definitely not to the degree I would have liked. Nevertheless, this book is a gem. Read it and I think you'll be filled mostly with awe and wonder, feelings that will overlook any faults within this narrative."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2327397-melissa", "userReview": "This book! It starts out tight-packed and strange, bristling with spiky little clues and oddities: Jane is a recently bereaved 18-year-old who has followed her aunt's last request, that she accept any invitation she receives to the grand estate Tu Reviens. After a fortuitous run-in with the house's heiress--Jane's former tutor--Jane finds herself in the massive, Frankensteinish place amid a cast of variously shady characters on the eve of a seasonal gala.This is Jane standing at the center of the umbrella (she's a devoted umbrella maker), choosing which of the house's mysteries to follow to its conclusion. In Choose Your Own adventure style, the book takes Jane down five divergent paths, each following on the heels of one of the house's other occupants. It expands outward like an alien flower, becoming bigger and weirder and more daring with every section, skidding from big-house mystery into slipstream (hooray!) while perfectly maintaining its unhurried pace and crystalline precision of language and tone.A wizardly feat.

I enjoyed her worldbuilding and imagination in those stories. That series was very much fantasy, this is contemporary UF with a twist. I\u2019m not even sure I can explain the twist because that would totally give away some of the magic of the story. It\u2019s a little like Clue meets Groundhogs Day. Let\u2019s just say that Jane is a girl who is at a spot in her life where she could make a lot of choices. Each choice will lead her on a different path. Some of those paths are wondrous, some are crazy odd and others lead to certain death.Jane takes a minute to get used to. She is a little bit sad and a little bit quirky. She is like a modern day heroine out of something like Jane Eyre or Pride and Prejudice. \nJane suddenly feels like a character in a novel by Edith Wharton or the Brontes. I\u2019m a young woman of reduced circumstances, with no family and no prospects, invited by a wealthy family to their glamorous estate. Could this be my heroic journey.\nBut once you lock into her straight man sense of humor and dry wit she is extraordinarily wonderful and I just wanted to help her through some of the grief she was feeling after the loss of her aunt who raised her. Also I really want a Jane, Unlimited Umbrella of my very own. They seemed so wondrous and it was such a different little niche for a character to focus on and be good at. Plus armed with a larger umbrella who knows what you could fight off.\n\u201dI\u2019ll drink to that,\u201d she said, then threw back her drink, leaned over the bar, reached into a container of paper umbrellas, and selected one, blue and black to match Jane\u2019s shirt and her tattoo tentacles. Opening it carefully, she twisted it between her fingers, then presented it to Jane.\u201cProtection,\u201d Kiran announced.\u201cFrom what?\u201d Jane asked, examining the umbrella\u2019s delicate working interior.\u201cFrom Bullshit,\u201d said Kiran.\u201cWow,\u201d Jane said. \u201cAll this time, I could\u2019ve been stopping bullshit with a cocktail umbrella?\u201d\u201cIt might only work for really small bullshit.\u201d\nThere are some really funny side characters throughout the story. Jasper the basset hound beset by gravity was really my favorite side character in this. The whole time I was thinking he was more than just a dog. I even harbored hopes that he was secretly a shifter hound (he isn\u2019t) but I would have been on board if he was.There were two potentialish love interests but I want to point out that they were very minor and I believe there were two (possibly three) kisses in this. There was absolutely no love triangle so don\u2019t worry about that. But the two possibilities were exceptionally different. One was the dashingly handsome, wealthy playboy Ravi and the other was the wordsmithing, not what she appears to be Ivy. Yes you got that right one was male and one female. This is an equal opportunity book and Jane is in her college years so you should try everything at least once\u2026right? I wasn\u2019t extremely interested in Jane with anyone actually. I was deeply interested in Kiran\u2019s love life but that was a different story completely. Still it was unusual but possibly fitting since Jane is at an age where she is finding herself. Both are very likable in their own ways and I could see how they could each have had a place in Jane\u2019s life so it wasn\u2019t disconcerting.Kiran is a character I wasn\u2019t sure if I was going to like in the beginning of the book. She is a bit short and harsh but later that is totally part of her charm. She definitely grew on me and I was very interesting in what was going on in the strange house that she brought Jane to. But once you get to see Kiran interact with her twin it makes a little more sense why she is so dry and it made her all the more likable.\n\u201cHmph!\u201d says Ravi. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky I need to keep you around, in case I ever need a kidney.\u201d\u201cLike I\u2019d ever give you my kidney.\u201d\u201cYou would totally give me your kidney.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s totally a universe somewhere where I\u2019ve refused to give you my kidney,\u201d says Kiran.Ravi is smiling. \u201cLet\u2019s go get that Kiran\u2019s kidney, just to spite her. We could keep it on ice until one of us needs it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a disturbing idea,\u201d Kiran says. \u201cBut practical.\u201d\nThe house Tu Reviens was a character all its own. Nothing was what it seemed and it took a while for Kristen Cashore to tease the full story out about what is going on with all the characters and the actual house. But I loved how it was described most of the time with all the different pieces kind of thrown together. It seemed like it was a character part of the story.\n\u201cCharlotte kept saying that the house is made of orphaned pieces,\u201d says Kiran.\u201cOrphaned pieces?\u201d I\u2019m an orphaned piece, aren\u2019t I? \u201cYeah. Charlotte said the only thing unifying all the parts is pain. That the house is in constant agony. Charlotte wanted to find another way to unify the house, to bind its pieces. So the house can rest.\u201d\nThis book is hard to rate because it feels so disjointed in some ways. Everything is interconnected but at the same time some of the stories seem so separate. I will say I loved the beginning and enjoyed most of various turns in the book. The story involving Charlotte was completely disturbing and I will never think of Winnie the Pooh the same again. But overall it is different and strange and I do applaud that."}, {"userName": "Kyleigh", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23533526-kyleigh", "userReview": "I LOVED this book.

I mean I\u2019ve heard so many good things about the Graceling trilogy that I was kind of disappointed with this book??? Okay, first things firstTHE REPRESENTATION. The book had Indian characters and our main lead, Jane, was BI. So that counts for something right? One positive thing: it was a diverse book. The main plotline Jane\u2019s aunt, who Jane has lived with since she was a kid, just died on one of her trips and a lot of it is focused on Jane grieving for her. Then Jane bumps into a childhood friend who is super rich and invites Jane to come to her mansion, which is on an Island. Just before aunt Magnolia left for her trip, she made Jane promise never to turn down an invitation to that house so Jane says yes and sets off to the Island. The first part of the book read like a mystery as there\u2019s a lot of sketchy business going on when Jane arrives. There are kidnappings involved, spies and the mafia, art thieves and it gave me such Nancy drew vibes because Jane actually took it upon herself to try to solve the mystery of the stolen art piece, which was worth a 100 million dollar. YEP!!! She made a list of all the suspects and everything. AND she ended up solving the mystery too. But then things got confusing. Everything started happening over again and I was like ???????? What is happening. I went on goodreads and read a few reviews and then I understood. This is not a mystery book. Actually, it involves alternate dimensions and how there are different versions of us in different dimensions and how each version makes different decisions and lives different lives. AND I\u2019ve always loved this concept soooo much. I\u2019ve only read it once before (a thousand pieces of you which was disappointing) and I got so excited. After I understood what was actually happening, I realized that there were SO many clues and hints that were pointing into that direction: about parallel universes and when I started picking them up it gave me such a sense of accomplishment hah. So each alternate reality is a different genre. One is paranormal, one is fantasy and there are aliens, one has talking dogs etc etc. So I was reading and reading and waiting for the build up to lead to something. Anything. But the only thing it led upto was disappointment. The more I read the more, hilariously unbelievable and absurd the story became. By the end of it, I was literally laughing. Like, is this a joke??? Is everything really happening. I mean c\u2019mon, houses that eat people? Are you serious. And also, it became so repetitive with everything happening over and over again and just boring. If the book wasn\u2019t so unbelievably unrealistic, I would have liked it so much more. There was soooo much potential and if Kristin Cashore had focused on one plot and explored it to its fullest potential and developed it only instead of randomly throwing in everything and halfheartedly attempting to make the book include every genre it would have been so much better. It just wasn\u2019t well executed. Also, the so called romance in this book? Ivy and Jane???? How did that happen. I don\u2019t understand. Was it insta love? I can\u2019t even figure that out. Happened out of nowhere. Also, the dog in this book was so weird and that bond between Jane and him? Way too creepy, I\u2019m telling you \ud83e\udd10Is it too much to ask for a GOOD bisexual book???
