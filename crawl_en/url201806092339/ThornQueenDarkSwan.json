Any frustrations I had with the character were in Thorn Queen for a reason - to develop flawed characters and bring the MC closer to where she needs to be. That said, I need to get this rant out of my system: I. HATE. KIYO.Reasons: *SPOILERS AHEAD*-At the start of Thorn Queen, Kiyo has supposedly moved in with Eugenie and Tim in her quaint little house. In reality he brings all his cats and dogs to the house, leaves poor Tim (my bae) to take care of them somehow, then leaves to spend 24/7 either at work or with his pregnant gentry-queen ex. He only shows up to have wild animal sex with Eugenie and watch her sleep every now and then.-Eugenie is half human Shaman, half supermegafoxyawesomehot gentry slayer queen. You'd think, since Kiyo is also half gentry, that he would understand what it's like to be torn between worlds and encourage Eugenie to flourish on both sides. BUT NO. He spends his time belittling her magical abilities, he tells her to stay in the human world and stop practicing magic. Essentially he tells her to be a good little woman and stay at home, safe and docile, where she belongs. What a dick. Eugenie can control water and air, as well as call lightning from the sky, she could decimate a city if she had the proper training! HOW DARE KIYO try to keep her from realizing her full potential?! A boyfriend who truly loves her wouldn't clip Eugenie's wings like that.-Don't even got me started on how hypocritical his above actions are. Kiyo spends loads of time in the Otherworld, where he has a baby with another woman! Then he gets jealous over Eugenie's friendship with Dorian while Eugenie is just supposed to accept his relationship with Maiwenn. Hardly fair. Besides, Kiyo uses his gentry power - turning into a fox - whenever convenient, and it often makes him more animal than man even after he's turned back. Clearly using his Otherworld power changes him (not for the better), but you don't see Eugenie asking him to give that up!-The man doesn't do foreplay. That's just selfish. Never trust someone who's not into foreplay.-And here's the whopper, the cherry on the sundae. Eugenie is raped and abused several times in Thorn Queen. But when she gets the chance to kill her rapist, Kiyo holds her back because \"you're not thinking straight Eugenie, you're in shock.\" Leith committed most heinously evil violation against his GIRLFRIEND, and he won't avenge her or even let her avenge herself. He ain't even that mad. Those are not the actions of someone in love - in fact, Dorian is the one who steps up and dispatches Leith to give Eugenie some measure of emotional relief. We have a clear winner here.Putting Kiyo aside.... Eugenie had issues too. She's not as stubbornly biased against all of gentry-kind in this book, thanks to Dorian's convincing. However, she is pretty willfully ignorant when it comes to ruling her Thorn Kingdom. She delegates each and every task to her poor servants, has no idea that her people are starving and suffering in the desert. It takes a lot of character development and ignoring Kiyo for her to make up for those mistakes. Of course Eugenie's insistence on staying with Kiyo and denying Dorian was frustrating. She clearly trusts Dorian more - she lets him tie her up, after all - and cheats on Kiyo without much guilt. Yet it still takes her the whole book to understand which man is better for her.Tim is my new book boyfriend. His antics as a fake Native American are always giggle-worthy. \n\"For my first poem,\" continued Tim, \"I would like to read you something I was inspired to write while sitting outside and considering the way the beating of a butterfly's wings are just like the beating of our hearts in this transient world.\" Spreading his hands wide, he recited.Sister Butterfly upon the windWings so yellowLet us fly with you into the sky so blueOur souls soaring in the clouds so whiteAs we look down on those who dream to flyBut are too afraidAnd must stay earthboundLike Brother Beetle so brown\n Best poem ever!"}, {"userName": "Catherine", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3282244-catherine", "userReview": "Oh my God! This book was awesome! The minute I read the last page I jumped up and ran to my laptop to look up when the next book comes out. Not until 2011, nooooooo! I'm already dying to read it!Well, this book was recommended to me by my GR friend, Shannon. She was hesitant, because our tastes don't always align, but I'm glad she bit the bullet and rec'ed it anyway. I read Storm Born first, so I wouldn't be lost reading this one, and while I did enjoy it, I also didn't think it was that great. I was nervous about reading this one, but it surpassed all of my expectations!The beginning was a little slow for me. A lot of time was devoted to Kiyo and their relationship. I've disliked him since the first book, so I was less than thrilled to have to read so much about him. Also, all their relationship consists of is them having sex. With so much page time devoted to their relationship it translates into a lot of page time devoted to them having sex. Their sex wasn't particularly interesting either. I'm not against aggressive, animalistic sex, but Kiyo took it pretty far. When your partner implies they find your orgasm-giving skills lacking and wants more foreplay you should probably pay attention. I couldn't believe that Eugenie had to stop him and cuff him to make sure she got off first! Poor girl. No wonder she almost jumped out of her skin when Dorian grabbed her arm in the beginning. She's probably dying for someone to dominate her and work her over.I loved getting more information about Eugenie's kingdom. As someone who lives near Tucson I was shocked when she morphed her land into it. I thought she must have been high, but whatever works for her... I'm glad she got confronted with the real issues of how her choice affected her people. They have to relearn how to grow crops and find water and they need to figure out how to get some A/C in there. I'm glad the stuff like that wasn't skimmed over.Dorian impressed me a lot in this book. I found him interesting in the first one, but also kind of flat. This one really helped add depth for me. He seems more like a ruler who actually cares than a bored royal. I loved the speech he gave Eugenie about being protecting her people or admitting to them that she couldn't. He showed real passion and intensity there. As much as he likes to don his bored royal mask, he is dead serious about what it means to be a king or queen.I was really glad that Dorian moved on after Eugenie dumped him in the last book. I know him sleeping with other people will piss some readers off, but I loved it. I don't want to see him pine from his kingdom, waiting for her to finally decide she's going to dump Kiyo and come to him. She dumped him and was sleeping with someone else, it would have been dumb for him to wait around. Although we did get a nice hint of his pining for her in his own unique way.Dorian endeared himself to me forever with one sword stroke at the end. I was so glad that someone did that, damn the consequences. I couldn't believe Kiyo laid that pile of crap on Eugenie to get her to back down. Way to make the victim feel like shit about herself! Thank goodness Dorian was there.Kiyo bothered me throughout this whole book. His booty call tendency toward Eugenie was really distasteful. I also can't believe he knew all the problems her kingdom was having and didn't mention it to her. Why is he so down on her magic and queenship anyway? He had no problem sleeping with his baby's mama. Why is it only bad when Eugenie does it? I also can't believe that Kiyo didn't have the decency to send Eugenie a message during (or even after) the birth happened. He seems to have no consideration for anyone other than himself.I outright hated him when he talked Eugenie down from having her revenge. That's not the thing you think about when you find out about that situation. He should have been cheering her on or asking if he could do it for her. Then, he had the balls to try to get her to apologize??? What the hell is wrong with him? I'm so glad things turned out that way. I really hope he won't be a major part of the series anymore.I love Dorian to death now, but his world domination excitement at the end made me nervous for their future. I can't wait to get the next book! Thanks for the rec Shannon!"}, {"userName": "Denisa", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14215152-denisa", "userReview": "[ The main character, Eugene, kept denying what she was and she was a bit annoying at first.

And I am not truly sure how I feel about it. I only know that it got very emotional and a bit depressing, as well as rage inducing toward the end... It began soon after the end of the last book. Most of the first 40% was about Eug and Kiyo establishing a cadence in their relationship and we got to observe some passionate, aggressive and animalistic sex. This would be perfectly fine, if it was not pretty much the only dimension to their relationship. It seems like Kiyo is using Eug's house for dumping overflow animals from his vet clinic, and shows up only to get him some. Also, Eug is obviously looking for some variety in bed, several times implying that they might need some foreplay... Dude, listen to the lady!!! Then, if in the morning they had some face time together, it was usually dominated by him lecturing her on not using or learning about her magic and forgetting her newly acquired kingdom and the people there who depend on her... During the rest of the time he would go to work, but mostly, go and \"support\" his supposed ex-girlfriend, the mother of his future child, since she is pregnant and needs all of his attention... Gack!!! Pretty much, he is showing his ass and it is coming off as a very selfish one at that... A lot of page time was devoted to Eugenie finding her way to learning and connecting with her kingdom. The Tucson, AZ like land, which has been what she grew up with, but which has become a blight on the lives of the locals, is a difficult kingdom to support and the folks there have to figure out how to survive... I thought the issues were very well described and I felt true compassion for her subjects... I hope she does not turn them all into Tequila Addicts... \n....\"\u201cWell\u2026,\u201d said Davros at last. \u201cThere must be something. You\u2019ve placed a blight on the land, stripping us of our water and food. Surely we\u2019ve done something to warrant your most righteous displeasure.\u201d\u201cYou need only let us know what it is,\u201d piped in someone else. \u201cWe will do anything you require to lift this curse from us.\u201d...\nThen there is Dorian. Yes, I can not keep protesting - he is charming, smart, and seems to care for her, but I just can not trust him!!! He is sooo obsessed with power and taking over the world, every step he takes and every good deed he makes I question his motives and can not give my blessing for a possible romance, at least not yet... However, he can help her claim her birthright and become a Queen in deed, not just in name...So, as far as the love triangle goes, Kiyo with all his sexual energy and passionate tenancies, still feels more like a booty call, while Dorian seems to be interested only in the power and prestige they can help each-other to posses. On top of that, Dorian is always easy to cut her off and go play with the next chick on the waiting list of fawning ladies... Also, Eugenie has a tendency for going with whoever is getting her hot and bothered at the time, so her staying power is a bit questionable as well... Thus, I think for a real and worthy lover, MR should offer Eugenie a whole new love interest, one who would appreciate her for who she is, not just what she offers and maybe keep her mind on him only!!! The last 30% of the book took a turn, which made this a very difficult for me read... I did not expect it and it was riveting, but a constant rage was running through my veins all the way to the end... It made Eugenie face her divided loyalties to humans and Gentry, it made her face her own prejudices and see her own failings. It was a very difficult lesson to learn and I wish she did not have to go through it, but some interesting consequences were derived from it. One, I was angry and very disappointed with Kiyo, despite seeing his point of view and mostly understanding it. Still, he fell short in how he treated Eug.... Very short! Second, Dorian showed he is the better man in real adverse situations, although I foresee many horrible outcomes form his decisive and very well deserved actions!!! \n...\"Why does it matter to you if humans are over there anyway?\u201d\u201cBecause those humans might be harming gentry.\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201d\u201cAnd it\u2019s not right.\u201dHe snorted and returned to his trimming. \u201cThey\u2019re gentry, Eugenie. They\u2019re not like us. And from what I hear, you\u2019re not all that gentle with them anyway.\u201d\u201cWhen they\u2019re in this world, yeah.\u201d\u201cAny world, Eugenie. They\u2019re literally not human. Why do you care so much?\u201d\u201cNone of your business.\u201d The harsh words were out before I could stop them. Art paused again and this time turned to fully face me.\u201cAnd it\u2019s none of your business where I go and what I do\u2014in either world.\u201dMy heart lurched in my chest.... \u201cIt matters to them.\u201d\u201cI think you\u2019re asking the wrong questions here. You need to examine your motives and figure out why you\u2019re so eager to defend those who have no regard for us\u2014and why you\u2019re picking fights with your own kind.\u201d.......\nOverall, this was very emotional, leaving me with a bitter taste at the end, but also with the NEED to find out how things proceed... I am going to jump on the next volume as soon as next Wednesday arrives. I would not recommend this for young readers, and maybe not younger then 16... I know even I had issues with some of the happenings in this book, it might be too dark for the young at heart... I wish you all Happy Reading and let's enjoy the last days of the Olympic Games in Rio!!!"}, {"userName": "Felicia", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/666892-felicia", "userReview": "SPOILERS!!!!!!!So it started out a little slow, but the book got really good. I REALLY enjoyed the first in the series and this one, after the first few chapters, really built upon the fun of the last one. I like how this series is breaking the \"modern-day magic kick ass woman user solving crimes\" by taking her into the Faery Land and developing stories INSIDE there and ultimately leaving the story there. SPOILERS:I never liked Kiyo, I really think he was a milk-sop, so the ending of the book, when Dorian runs the other dude through was like totally worth the price of admission. That one line was like, damn that guy is awesome! My biggest fear at this point is that I can see how the author is setting up Dorian to go wrong in the next book, that his ambition will get out of control and Eugenie will leave him because of it and I'm like \"DONT SEND HER BACK TO KIYO I LOVE DORIAN!\"I will be very sad if she does that because it's kinda predictable. What would be more interesting is if he started to go bad and then redeemed himself somehow. I really dig them together, but ending the second book with them together kinda signals it won't turn out well, sigh.

THIS IS THAT KIND OF BOOK FOR ME.First we have Eugenie. I like her badass powers, I like her snark, I like her desire to help everyone, I like her sense of fairness and desire to help people in both worlds and her desire not to birth a son that would try and take over the human world. But I\u2019m also frustrated with internal struggle with being \u00bd human and \u00bd fae. I\u2019m frustrated with her current choice of boyfriend in the beginning of the book. I hate how she is trying so hard to run from the responsibility of having a fae land and running it. I also struggle with her internal strife over Kiyo having a baby with Maiwenn. I get that this is a book where she is torn between two worlds and it is supposed to be difficult but she is infuriating sometimes because she has so many awesome powers and I just want her to accept and take charge of them.I\u2019m not even going to talk about her struggle between Dorian and Kiyo because for me she really crosses some lines and I\u2019m not sure how much I care because it went to Dorian\u2019s favor this time but if it was the other way around I\u2019d be pissed\u2026.#trianglesarecomplicated Still she is really flip floppy and I just want her to make a decision and stick with it, well as long as it is the decision I want her to make.Then there is Kiyo. ARGGG\u2026.where to start.  I was okay with him in the first book but this is the book where I really start to despise him. He is such a buzz kill\u2026.\u201dDon\u2019t practice your magic Eugenie. I\u2019d make you give up your kingdom if you could, Eugenie. You can\u2019t ever have a child, Eugenie. Don\u2019t sleep with Dorian, Eugenie.\u201d see nag, nag, nag\u2026\n I cut him a glance. \u201cYou\u2019d make me, huh?\u201d\u201cEncourage,\u201d he amended. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s a moot point. The only way to lose a kingdom is if your power drops or\u2026well, if you\u2019re killed.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure Volusian would love to help with that.\u201dMy minion walked near me, needing no horse to move swiftly. Upon hearing his name, he said, \u201cI would perform the deed with great relish and much suffering on your part, mistress.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t put a price on that kind of loyalty,\u201d\nAnd in the midst of all of that Kiyo is the father of the Willow Queen\u2019s child and is busy with the impending birth of his baby so he pretty much shows up to \u2018hit it\u2019 and then is gone again. Plus there is the moment at the end that solidified for me that he doesn\u2019t really love Eugenie. Let\u2019s just say that Kiyo is a fox and is supposed to have animal instincts and that is totally the case when shows up to have sex with Eugenie. He is supposedly acting like she is his mate. But then the \u2018big thing\u2019 happens and he is the voice of peace and reason. I call a RED FLAG on that play, because if he truly thought of her as his mate then he should have taken the action that Dorian did. Instead he totally failed her in my opinion.Meanwhile Dorian is patiently waiting\u2026.well sort of. The fae king makes no qualms about laying it out for Eugenie that he is all about her whether she is willing to have a child with him or not. \n\u201cEugenie, you\u2019re a woman without equal, and no matter how much you annoy the hell out of me and no matter how much I try to get you out of my head\u2014and believe me, both occur regularly\u2014I can\u2019t stay away from you. Even if you were barren, I\u2019d take you as my consort in an instant and spend the rest of my life with you \u2014 childless, so long as it meant you\u2019d be by my side. I would gladly bring you to my bed with no other thoughts than taking joy from your body. It would be enough.\u201d\n He shows her in a lot of ways that he is there for her. Dorian took the time to try and help her with her kingdom and kept showing up to assist her even when she didn\u2019t know she was going to need assistance. He did some other stuff that I hated but he gets a pass on since he is fae and can\u2019t just be pining and waiting for Eugenie to come around but overall he treated her like a man in love with her. After the \u2018big thing\u2019 happens Dorian did what I felt Kiyo should have done and I applauded him.The Plot - There is this prophecy that the Storm King\u2019s grandson will take over the human world. I really want to know the wording of the true undiluted prophecy but essentially a lot of the plot revolves around various men trying to knock Eugenie up with or without her consent. Usually I don\u2019t like it when authors use the threat of rape as a baseline but because of the nature of the plot it works in this story. Let\u2019s just say the \u2018big thing\u2019 sucks\u2026.it isn\u2019t graphic but you know it happens and so I like to give warning because it is one of my hot buttons. But it isn\u2019t just thrown into the story for gratuitous reasons. There is a point and it adds to the overall story but the entire plot of this book is darker than the prior one\u2026you\u2019ve been warned.There are some comic relief moments with Volusian and Jasmine (I might be starting to like that girl) but overall this is a darker ride. I was so frustrated with the characters but also so emotionally invested in the story that once I started it I couldn\u2019t stop. Like I said a weird tug-of-war but now I must know how everything will go and how the story will end so onto book 3."}, {"userName": "Shannon", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2016128-shannon", "userReview": "It's always harder for me to review a book that I gave five stars to, and I think it's just easier for me to point out flaws than to pinpoint what makes a book amazing for me. I'll give it a shot though.Eugenie is struggling with adapting to her new life of being the Thorn Queen while still trying to continue on as a shaman in the human world. She focuses on something in one world while ultimately neglecting something in the other.When Eugenie became the Thorn Queen she transformed her lands into the spitting image of Tucson, not realizing that the people would have no idea how to cultivate the land. After visiting Maiwenn, who's still pregnant with Kiyo's child, Eugenie comes across a village. They fear her and ask her why she's punishing them with all the droughts and harsh conditions. She had no idea that her people were even suffering, but with only have knowledge equivalent to medieval times, the people had no idea how to grow food in the desert.So Eugenie decides to help the people, and she uses her powers to find them water. After visiting with them for a little while she's also told that young girls had been vanishing recently, taken by bandits. This is also news to Eugenie, and she can't help but want to find the girls for them and stop the bandits. This is very similar to the story in Storm Born, except for the fact that it's gentry girls being taken this time. To say the least, a lot happens in this novel. There are a lot of storylines going on but Mead manages to tie them all together skillfully. Eugenie has also grown and matured immensely, and become more compassionate when it comes to the gentry. Before she barely thought of them as people and now they're her subjects, friends, lovers, and companions.We get a lot of character development for everyone else as well, but it's hard to say anything without spoiling something. Dorian though, is a complete and utter BADASS. But if you didn't see that coming after reading Storm Born then I don't know what book you were reading.It's hard to say exactly what makes this book so perfect for me. In a way, it just feels epic. After only reading two books in this series I have a connection with the characters that just doesn't happen all that often.

Despair for the seemingly unending chasm of time until the next book in the series is released; pity for the next book I was to read after this one, as I was most certainly going to punish it for not being this book. :o)So. As for the book itself. This second installment in the Dark Swan series revisits Eugenie Markham a few months after the conclusion of Storm Born. Though still the Queen of Thorn Land, she is absolutely staunch in her avoidance of the related responsibilities. She really only decides to break her extended absence from the Otherworld in order to attend the baby shower of (her boyfriend) Kiyo's soon-to-be baby-mama. While on that visit, she is introduced to a whole host of problems that she can't ignore: you know, small things like starving people, serial kidnappings, and general unruliness in the Thorn Land.Eugenie is again faced with the task of working out feelings on her dual heritage. I dig that she is (to a point) realistic about her situation, being fiercely protective of her humanity, but still allowing herself to reexamine that buildup of countless prejudices and preconceived notions about the gentry, a race of which she is technically a member. Moreover, this seems to be a long and thoughtful process and not some disingenuous \"I see the light\" resolution.I can't lie, though...what had me most excited about getting to read this book wasn't Eugenie but rather the chance to revisit Dorian and Kiyo. Richelle Mead really knows how to craft a compelling love triangle...one in which it's truly difficult to root for just one particular pairing. The two guys are, as portrayed, perfect foils for the two sides of Eugenie's character.Equally well-done was the main \"mystery\" of the book; it was not completely predictable (at least to me), and kept me eager to turn the pages.****major-ish SPOILER ahead, bewares!****I've got to hand it to Ms. Mead for her bravery in writing the climax to unfold the way it did. Having the main character go through prolonged imprisonment and abuse (including repeated sexual assault) is no small thing, and it could've been a disaster, given the tone and focus of the book (and series) thus far. Pretty heavy stuff, man. As it was, it was chilling, heart wrenching, and powerful. I was floored and touched by the strength of Eug and her fellow abductees.****End major-ish SPOILER section****All in all, my excitement for the next book in this series had been turned up even higher than it was after reading the first book, which I didn't think was possible.

One of the major issues I had with Storm Born was that after having a one night stand and a few conversations, Eugenie decided she was in love with Kiyo, who seemed to me to be nothing but a personality-less, sleazy liar, to the extent that she wanted to die for him. So no, I did not enjoy her relationship with him in this book.However, the thing that ruined it for me was Eugenie's abduction in which she was repeatedly raped. Rape is a difficult event to write, and in this case I found it was neither handled sensitively, nor was included for any valid reason. The rape is used as a plot device to give her a reason to want to break up with Kiyo and run to Dorian instead. Apparently she would die for Kiyo, but then leaves him because he doesn't instantly kill her rapist. But it's not like this is because the rape with such a horrible, life-changing experience, because the rape has absolutely no lasting effects on Eugenie, and she's able to jump straight into bed with Dorian. I could have liked the book a lot more if Eugenie was, say, beaten up instead of raped.

Took time to get used to her as the voice of Eugenie in the first book, but her handling of the other characters, as well as her voice for Eugenie, really grew on me. She may sound a bit older than I expected Eugenie's character to sound, but Eugenie is wise beyond her years and has dealt with a lot more than a normal woman her age. Think I'll probably be checking out some other Jennifer Van Dyck-narrated novels once I finish this series."}, {"userName": "Elena", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3701038-elena", "userReview": "I was totally on board with this book for the first 300 pages. Great character dynamics, interesting world, intriguing plot... Then the heroine, Eugenie, was raped. And the rape was nothing more than a plot device. There are so many other things that could have been used to achieve the same goal, plot-wise, but for some reason, Mead chose rape. And she obviously didn't do any research beforehand either, because after the rape bit of the book, she immediately makes the incredibly stupid and well-known (if only she had done a smidgeon of research) magic healing penis mistake by having Eugenie turn right around (after a few weeks of weeping into her mom's arms) and magically erase all the badness of the rape by having wonderful sex with Dorien, who has been pursuing her with mixed success for two books. I'll admit I love Dorien, and I was hoping they'd get together, but this was not the way it should have happened. I'm so, so disappointed in Richelle Mead right now. I might read the third book in the series anyway, because I WAS so into this world, but I don't know if I'll be able to handle it if Eugenie doesn't have any emotional aftereffects to deal with, and I'm fairly certain that Mead isn't going to bother with more than the occasional cursory flashback. Sigh.Update 2/1/12: Because this is still bothering me, I want to mention that if you're interested in reading urban fantasy that handles rape well, check out Patricia Briggs' Mercy Thompson books."}, {"userName": "Fani *loves angst*", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1133802-fani-loves-angst", "userReview": "4.5 starsTo say that this is better than the first is a gross understatement.

The heroine however is never going to be a favorite of mine with phrases like \"yeah, he made love to you so passionately because he was thinking of me\" or \"every man would give his right arm to sleep with me\", hence the 4 stars instead of 5.

I enjoyed almost every moment. Our heroine Eugenie commutes between the human world working as a shaman and the Otherworld as the Thorn Queen. Eugenie has grown and developed as a character. She genuinely cares about her kingdom and tries to work out ways for her subjects to be able to survive in the new arid lands. When some girls go missing, Eugenie starts to hunt for them. I found it interesting that Eugenie does not tell her stepfather about her new position in the Otherworld. Gentry are still after Eugenie, hoping to impregnate her and fulfill the prophecy. Eugenie continues to learn how to use her magical powers, learning from Dorian\u2019s mistress. The banter between Eugenie and Ysabel was humorous and we get an insight into Dorian\u2019s many talents in the bedroom. We learn from Ysabel that he also has artistic talents with a paintbrush. Hmm\u2026knots and paint. Dorian proves himself to be a good friend and ally to Eugenie. The sexual tension between the Eugenie and Dorian was delicious. Which brings us to Kiyo. I am ashamed to admit that I actually liked Kiyo in the first book. I came to despise him in this book. I found him judgmental and lacking empathy for Eugenie. One of the memorable scenes that stand out in the book is Queen Maiwenn\u2019s baby shower. As the gentry rarely have young, the gifts were just a little inappropriate for a baby. Fine china and gemstones were amongst the gifts, contrasted with Eugenie\u2019s gift of a teddy bear. I can't believe that there will be such a long wait for the next novel in the series.

But since Mead has 3 amazing series, we get 3 doses of her each year! It's great. Thorn queen met and went above any exceptions I had. I love the characters and the drama. I liked Eugenie's point of view. She's straightforward, interesting and easy to get attached to even if it's not exactly our type of world she lives in. She has some what of a hard time in her new world because she grew up in our world and is mostly used to just that. Of course the change is hard on her.  Both Kiyo and Dorian are still part of her life and she has some obstacles as queen and for her love life to over come. I'm really liking Dorian this time around. He's my new favorite. I can't wait to see where things go in the next book. She also starts to grow more confident and sure of herself. This series has great plots and leaves me wanting more. I really enjoyed this book!

I enjoyed the second installment of the Dark Swan but I must say I am so confused and concerned by the overwhelming number of novels on the shelf right now written by female authors that use rape as the element of the plot. Yes, I am aware that rape occurs but most of these books treat it lightly and do not deal with the aftermath and the healing necessary to restore the characters. Because of this I had to lower my rating of the book. I would think that a woman would handle this situation with greater sensitivity. However, that does not seem to be the case. Don't get me wrong, my favorite author Patricia Briggs deals with rape in her novels but always with the realism of addressing the trauma and delicate recovery of the victims.

A good deal of this book was Eugenie attempting to lose her despot image amongst the gentry and constituents of her kingdom, whether it was through attending baby showers, finding water, having sex to save the land, or searching for young girls who had disappeared. Why did I feel like Eugenie was channeling Meredith Gentry when she brought about the rain through intimate relations? I was honestly afraid that ivy would come curling out of Kiyo or another magical tree would appear. EEK!Speaking of Mother Nature, it\u2019s hard for me to picture my ideal kingdom as a climate to match Tucson, Arizona -- Eugenie is definitely odd in that respect. Even though I personally lived in Phoenix in years past, if I could make a kingdom to match any climate that would definitely not be my ultimate landscape. Eugenie\u2019s kingdom villagers were convinced she had put a blight on the land as a curse. In Eugenie\u2019s own words: \n\u201cWhen Aeson had ruled, this land had been green and lush, filled with forests and fertile farmland. Who in their right mind would turn it into a desert?\u201d\n Great question, Eugenie -- you ninny! Part of her solution to the problem? A placemat. Ummm. Okay.Yes, yes\u2026 I\u2019m being hard on Eugenie. She\u2019s really not that bad. After all, Dorian likes her, so she can\u2019t be that bad *impish grin* Speaking of Dorian, I missed a lot of his humor in this book. I really loved his character in the first book, so I longed for more of his witty, sarcastic, and playful talk. I was so happy when the author forced Eugenie to \u201cnegotiate\u201d with Dorian over copper. Shame on Eugenie for not reading all the papers that she signed. Tsk tsk tsk.. Who knows what sort of lascivious things Dorian could have slipped inside that contract. Then again, he said that he hadn\u2019t, so I suppose he didn\u2019t. Too bad. *innocent whistle*Unlike my undying worship of Dorian, Kiyo continued to annoy me in this book. It\u2019s hard for me to pinpoint what it is about him, but there is something that just rubs me the wrong way. Okay, I can think of one thing: Kiyo comes off in the book as being selfish in bed. Booo!!!! I don\u2019t hate Kiyo for not killing Leith. I am kind of conflicted about that whole section of the book, in truth. I think that I would have preferred the rape to be handled more like Patricia Briggs handled it. I was a bit skeptical of how quick it seemed that Eugenie was able to recover. In fact, that\u2019s the primary reason I\u2019m rating this 4.5 stars instead of a full five. Well, that and I wanted *MORE* Dorian. MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE! :)Like the last book, there were even more new types of creatures to be found in the author\u2019s world. As an example, there were paisley suit coated \u201caliens\u201d who look through windows and do chores at night. (Send \u2018em over to my house -- it could use a good cleaning!!!! In reality, I think I would prefer to have Yoda in Osh-Kosh-Be-Gosh overalls gourmet cooking *and* deep cleaning.) The voice on the audiobook that did these creatures sounded a bit like the narrator sucked on some helium or lived with the Munchkins in the Wizard of Oz. A word used in the book that I happen to love: USURPER! And it was used *multiple* times. Wheee!!!! Usurp this. Usurper that. That\u2019s a word you don\u2019t get to hear everyday. :) :) :)"}, {"userName": "Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2614253-brandi-kosiner-brandi-breathes-books", "userReview": "I wanted to read Thorn Queen because I love Richelle Mead, as well as the first in this series. Eugenie is charismatic, and I love her passion and energy. She is now the queen of a kingdom in the other world since she defeated its king. She is totally inexperienced and didn't have much interest in it, but as the story goes on and she meets some of the subjects, she can't help but feel responsible and want to help.  She begins splitting her time between the worlds, and trying to figure out her new place in things. She is still with Kiyo, and I like them together, but they aren't without their issues. Kiyo of course is expecting a baby with one of the queens of the Fae world, Maiwenn. When he isn't doing that, or busy with his veterinarian job, Eugenie is balancing her shaman work with her obligations in the Thorn land.  Things get pretty complicated with known issues, and other new characters, ones that are still wanting to rape her, another who is in love with her and trying to win her hand, and having to deal with gentry girls going missing and coming back traumatized, and of course, her sister running around. Dorian is helping her be established as a queen and get her kingdom running by helping her to get staff in place, making trade negotiations, and sending someone to help her learn to work with air magic. There is still the sexual tension between the two, and I have to wonder like Eugenie does what his motivations are at times.  I love the funnies that Richelle writes in her books. It helps keep things from being too heavy, and I love her sense of humor. For example:\u201cI had a few other things on my mind. Like if it was going to rain every time I got aroused. That was not cool. I guessed I could handle it so long as it rained other times as well. I didn\u2019t want the connection to be so obvious. Hey, it\u2019s raining! The queen must have gotten laid. Ooh\u2026is that hail? Must have been into some kinky shit today.\u201d But even with the humor and the steam, she doesn't shy away from the complexities of character. Eugenie had so many layers, and she had to deal with lots. She was torn between the worlds. Her and her stepdad Roland fight about how much she's been going to the Otherworld. It is also an argument between her and Kiyo, and they begin having issues that are bigger than him being the father to another woman's baby. Kiyo also encourages her to stay out of the politics and doesn't want her to keep learning and practicing magic. It's sad but inevitable with the way the story was going. Dorian has a play in it, and he has to have his moment to shine, and Richelle may even go with him rather than Kiyo.  Some of her inner monologue really sums up her character struggles and growth in this one. I'd realized just before my capture that I loved both him and Kiyo, loved them just as my blood and soul were also split in two. The two halves of my nature would always war with each other.  The ending was good, and I liked the wrap up but the huge issues yet to be resolved, and Eugenie on a thin line balancing her control and desire for magic. I will definitely be continuing this series. Bottom Line: Great second book.

After that however I got sucked into an engaging, exciting and at certain times shocking and emotional story. Thorn Queen is the second in the Dark Swan series by Richelle Mead. Last book finished with Eugenie being tricked into taking on her own land in the Otherworld, the Thorn Land, and thus being it\u2019s rightful queen. This book shows us Eugenie trying to take up that role and in the mean while trying to get on with her life in the human world. Eugenie is sometimes literally torn between two worlds and loyalties to either side. To make things more complicated she also has two men she can\u2019t decide between: her kitsune boyfriend Kiyo, who\u2019s fathering the child of a gentry queen, and the ever charismatic but sly Dorian. All in all it takes several battles, hard times and a big drama to force Eugenie to make a choice in what she has to do and where (and with whom) she belongs. I\u2019m really curious as to how the story will unfold in the next book(s). 3,5 stars"}, {"userName": "Bec", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/120740-bec", "userReview": "I started the book not liking Kiyo a whole lot, and ended it absolutely loathing him. There's not really anything redeemable about this character and why Eugenie remains so attracted to him is a mystery. Sure he can fight, but Dorian does it a whole lot better. I guess his only 'bonus' is that he is half-human too, so he can live in both worlds. But seeing as he's determined to force Eugenie to live solely in the human world, and to give up her place in the Underworld, I really don't count this as a bonus. Honestly, I think his actions are more along the lines of \"Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer.\" I'm sure there's more going on with Maiwenn than he's letting on - after all, she is the mother of his daughter. I wonder if there is this type of plot line in place for the next few books... that all along he was only with Eugenie to keep an eye on her, try to dissuade her from spending time in the Underworld, and finally to attempt to stop her from having the Storm King's heir.I'll probably keep reading the series to the bitter end, because I really do want to know how it all ends, but I have to admit that I skim read a chunk of the last few chapters of this book.

This series is about Eugenie Markham, a strong, powerful shaman and the Thorn Queen of the Otherworld Thorn Lands. Eugenie, Odile Dark Swan, is the daughter of the legendary Storm King and according to the Otherworld Prophecy, she will be the mother to the next ruler of the mortal world. The Dark Swan Series is an incredible HOT story and is expertly written with humour, romance, and action. In this story, Eugenie is struggling with her feelings for Dorian and Kiyo. She\u2019s torn between her two worlds; the mortal world and the Otherworld. She wants to learn to use and control her magic but is afraid of turning into her father. She wants to protect the people of the Thorn Lands but she\u2019s afraid of betraying her human side. Kiyo has moved in with Eugenie but is spending most of his time with Maewinn, the mother of his unborn child. When he\u2019s with Eugenie, it\u2019s about getting off before returning to Maewinn. Eugenie loves Kiyo, but he\u2019s trying to control her use of magic and decisions in the Otherworld. His animalist lovemaking is intense, but it\u2019s all about his end result rather than sharing in pleasure. Eugenie and Dorian are friends, but she finds herself comparing her one night of passion with Dorian to Kiyo. Dorian truly understands her and doesn\u2019t try to change her or manipulate her decisions. Eugenie attends an otherworld baby shower at Maewinn\u2019s castle. Kiyo is proudly standing beside Maewinn, as father-to-be, but Eugenie find herself jealous over Dorian\u2019s consort rather than the bond between Kiyo and Maewinn. Shaya informs her that Dorian went weeks without a consort, a record for the seductively sexy King. Now, his partners all resemble Eugenie with fair skin and red hair. Eugenie finds this brings her comfort, although she\u2019s still jealous of Yzabel. When Eugenie discovers that her people are dehydrated and starving from the dry lands, she seeks out water and teaches them to thrive in the conditions. She learns that young women in her lands are being kidnapped and promises to find those responsible. Once seen as a Queen to be feared, she\u2019s now their saviour...to be feared. Eugenie and her guard confront a group of drifters who are harassing and stealing from her people. They capture two, but are attacked by fire demons. The fire demons are too strong for Eugenie to banish and they return home to develop a plan. After interrogating the prisoners they learn the drifters are not related to the missing woman but narrow down the location of their kidnapping. As punishment for harassment and theft, the drifters are put on work duty to help restore the villages in the Thorn Lands. When Kiyo\u2019s daughter is born, he doesn\u2019t contact Eugenie to share the news but instead sends his regrets that he\u2019ll be unable to meet her. She hears of the birth through the royal rumour mill. Dorian arrives to support her; no manipulation, just a shoulder to cry on. Eugenie meets Kiyo\u2019s daughter, who interprets her unhappiness for jealousy of Maewinn. Again, Kiyo doesn\u2019t try to understand her feelings. Eugenie returns home on her own, stopping in one of her villages to check on the progress the copper deposits. She speaks with Prince Leath, who\u2019s assisting with the development of the irrigation system and the local mayor. While there, she finds King Dorian has spent the day in the sun, using his magic to labour the lands. The beautiful King is covered in sweat and exhausted, but pushing forward and putting up a front of ease. In private, she forces him to rehydrate and demands to know his intensions on her lands. She words are harsh, but her heart is warm with gratitude. She realizes that she\u2019s been fighting her feelings for Dorian since the moment they met. She loves Dorian. She loves this man who understands her, but does she still love Kiyo? Could she love both men at the same time? In one moment they\u2019re arguing and the next their bodies are wrapped around each other and Dorian is stroking her body to orgasm. Moments away from penetration, and cheating on her boyfriend, they\u2019re interrupted with news that a kidnapped girl has returned. The girl is traumatized by her captors, her shaman human captors, and is unable to give any further details. Eugenie believes she knows the shaman taking the girls but doesn\u2019t know how to stop him. She contacts Rowan for guidance, but Rowlan only dismisses the accusations.Eugenie returns to her castle, where she\u2019s discovered the capture of her half-sister, Jasmine. Jasmine assigns her spirit minion to watch over Jasmine, both to protect her people and ensure she doesn\u2019t trigger the prophecy with an heir. Eugenie offers Jasmine a room in the castle, rather than the dungeon, if she agrees to help vanquish the fire demons by conjuring water demons. With a gun to her head, she agrees. Kiyo is disgusted with Eugenie\u2019s actions, accusing her of cruel behaviour towards her sister. Eugenie presents Dorian with a gift; a sword with a copper hilt and iron blade that he can control with his earth element. Kiyo is bothered by the gift, but Eugenie explains that the sword is a thank you gift for his help on her lands. Dorian and Kiyo go into battle against the fire demons, with Eugenie, Jasmine, and their guards. With their help, the water demons beat the fire demons but Jasmine is too weak to control them and they\u2019re attacked. Eugenie connects her magic with Jasmine and they banish the last demon. Jasmine collapses and Kiyo rushes her to a healer. Eugenie sees a spy and investigates with two of her guard. She is captured and wakes up in a mortal dungeon. Leith is working with two shaman to capture fairy girls to sell as sex slaves. The ones not sold are used as prostitutes in the dungeon/brothel. For the kidnapping of the girls, Leith receives human technology and the use of the girls. Eugenie was captured for Leith\u2019s personal use; to rape and impregnate before returning to the Otherworld with her as his bride. After a week of daily rapes, she convinces the slaves to replace the drug with another herb. Just when she\u2019s about to lose hope, the drug is switched and she\u2019s able to regain her strength and magic. She calls Velusion who attempts to kill her. She regains control of him and orders him to send word to Dorian. She uses one of the girls as a distraction as she breaks into the garage to find a weapon. She takes out her captors, but is shot in the shoulder. Leith returns for his daily rape, and is shocked to find Eugenie holding a gun to him. Dorian, Kiyo, and Roland arrive. Kiyo stops her from killing Leith, claiming his death isn\u2019t worth the war it will cause. He claims the Prince should return to the Otherworld, knowing a royal would not be punished. A furious Eugenie claims that he must die for raping the Queen and enslaving her people. Kiyo stands against his punishment, just in time for Dorian to slice his blade through the prince. Dorian claims that Leith had to die for what he did to Eugenie and her people. Dorian will take responsibility and if necessary, will go to war against Katrice. Eugenie returns to her mother\u2019s home to heal. She refuses to see Kiyo and looks to her mother for emotional support. Her mother is a therapist, a victim of rape, and although she\u2019s not happy about the connection to the otherworld, she understands. Rowlan is not as understanding and she returns to her home. When Kiyo tries to console her, she pushes him away. When he says she cannot return to the Otherworld and stop using he magic, she ends their relationship. She will no longer allow him to control her magic use or her connection to the Otherworld. He\u2019s not there when she needs him and when she needed his support, it was Dorian who stepped up and killed Leith. Kiyo accused her of ending their relationship because of Dorian and moved out.Eugenie later returned to the Otherworld to find her people gathering for war. She looks for another way to end the war, but the option is war or enslavement of her people and Dorian\u2019s to Katrice and marriage to Katrice\u2019s nephew. War it is. Dorian approaches Eugenie, but gives her the personal space she needs. They talk about the impending battle and he assures her he will take of the battles while she rests. She takes his hand and slowly moves to kiss him. Dorian is shocked and gently pulls away, telling her he can wait for her. Eugenie wants Dorian to wipe away memories of Leith, to have the man she loves be the last man inside of her. Dorian understands immediately, gently and passionately making love to her. Together, they lead their people to war against Katrice."}, {"userName": "Tina", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54816172-tina", "userReview": "I had a few problems with this one.

Richelle Mead is a straight-forward writer and an excellent story-teller. Her descriptions of the other world and supporting characters made it incredibly easy to relate to Eugenie Markham, the main character. (Yes, that's the main character's name. I hated it at first, and I still cringe sometimes when I read it.)So much happened around the main plot in Thorn Queen that it wasn't until I was halfway through the apex of the storyline that I realized that that was what the book was about. The relationship and internal character angst distracted me from seeing that there was an ever larger conflict and mystery to be solved by the main character.The last quarter of the book sped by quickly because everything was so tense that I couldn't put it down till things were resolved. There was action scene after action scene, and then after that, it was a bedroom action scene. I literally finished the book while waiting for a light to change on the street because I was walking while reading. That's how hard it is to put down.Even though when I started this series, I thought I'd have trouble believing a story about a woman who spends half her time in the real world and half her time in some other dimension fairy world, it actually works. Towards the end of this book, I started thinking of the fairy world as more permanent and real than the human world that Eugenie also inhabited.Thorn Queen has enough lead up into the story for people who never read the first book in the series, but I highly suggest reading the first book to just get the emotional baggage and background of all the characters. It makes the interactions in this book all the more worthwhile. Although the plot was decent and the mystery not bad, what I really liked about Thorn Queen was the way characters related and hated each other. It was like fast-paced, magical, soap opera.SPOILERS BELOWOne of the best things about the book was that Eugenie finally dumped Kiyo for Dorian. In the first book, Kiyo seemed like a decent guy, but as soon as the baby thing got revealed, I was ready for her to get over him. That would have been a deal-breaker if it had been me, and since Eugenie is generally such an easy character to relate to, I couldn't imagine why she would want to hang on to Kiyo. I could deal with the turning into a fox *ahem* I mean kitsune thing despite my initial fear that there was going to be some weird furry sex going on, but the whole having a baby with another woman thing was the last straw.In this second book, even though it was obvious that Mead was hinting at the Eugenie-Kiyo relationship not working out, I couldn't rest easy until I read the words in the book. He just came on as too logical, uncompromising, and not right. When the \"Dorian to the rescue\" scene played out, I was so happy I could have clapped if I weren't holding my book. I had been rooting for him through this whole book even though like Eugenie, there was a nagging part of me that wondered if he really had some evil ulterior motive that is yet to be revealed.The ending in the book, like the first one tied up some loose ends, but still felt like a cliffhanger. I really hope the Dorian thing works out in the third book, but then, that wouldn't make the story very thrilling in the romance department. I just hope he doesn't turn totally evil, or get killed of, or get passed up for Kiyo once again.The character of Dorian reminded me a lot of Eric in the Sookie Stackhouse books by Charlene Harris. He came on as evil, ambitious, and selfish at first, but eventually it was revealed he could easily balance that with love for the main character. Like the case with Dorian, I started rooting for the Sookie-Eric team instead of the conventional Sookie-Bill team."}, {"userName": "Darcy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2225246-darcy", "userReview": "I really, really liked this book, much better than the first one. This time around what appealed to me most was the reluctance that Eugenie felt about her lands. I liked that she didn't want to just jump in and be all queenie. Her popping between worlds had to make her life much more difficult, but made her seem more real.I also get the jealousy she had with Kiyo and Maiween. Even if there is no longer any true love there, they will always be bound together through their child. What makes matters even worse is Eugenie knowing that while she wants this bond with Kiyo with the prophesy it would be too dangerous. Watching Kiyo and Maiween just seemed to drive it home.Dorian as usual is up to his tricks to get what he wants and doesn't care what is in the way. He is great at manipulating things in the direction that benefits him the most.While popping between worlds Eugenie seemed to think she had everything under control, and why wouldn't she, she had Shaya running things for her. Her problem lies in thinking that she would let her know if things weren't going well. Her eyes sure got opened riding across the lands. So often you can't fix something if you don't know it is broken, and this is what Eugenie ran into. Her quest to make things better for her people brought out her human and compassionate side. Something she will need to balance her out. Watching her deal with what is normal in her world but utterly out of wack in the Otherworld was interesting. Once aware of the problems she does what she can to help her people often coming up with unusal ways to do them.Finding out girls getting kidnapped takes her in a different direction, one where people who should be helping her don't and figuring out what is going on comes at a great personal expense.Once everything is said and done and Eugenie is left to figure out her emotions. Her life just seems like it is spinning out of control. She doesn't know where things stand with her stepfather. Things with Kiyo are radically different. I even understand her reasoning there and do think that she is right. Things with Dorian are radically different as well, and again I think she made the right decision.Now we wait and see what the consequenses are of all the choices that she and others have made."}], "description": "Eugenie Markham is a shaman for hire.
