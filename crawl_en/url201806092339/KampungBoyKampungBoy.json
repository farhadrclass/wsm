It kept me engaged through the use of various amounts of words on each page, the graphics, the cultural knowledge imparted, the way Lat made me instantly connect with the boy, Mat.

I don't get much out of this style of artwork. But I did love learning about a boy growing up in a kampung in rural Malaysia near a tin mine.My library shelved it as YA but I have no idea why. The most intense bit was the circumcision - at age 10! Call it Juvenilie, or call it 'all ages.'

I really enjoyed reading the illustrated story and I feel like the drawings conveyed just as much of the tale as the words do. Overall, it's a humorous book, but much more than that, it offers a window to catch a glimpse of life in a part of the world I have never seen before (probably never will). It also shows the universal concepts of familial affection, the ability for young children to get up to no good, and the food coma a student feels in the afternoon classes following lunch. I'm not sure if our local library carries any more of the books in this series, but I will certainly keep looking for them.interesting quotes:\"Well...that was also the day I discovered how angry Mum could get.I was so afraid of what Mum would do to me that I was running like a barking deer! She lost me near Pak Alang's house when the man, who knew me by sight, showed sympathy for me...But of course I got the thrashing later anyway.\" (pp. 22-23)\"One thing I discovered about an afternoon class was you tend to get sleepy...\" (p. 48)\"At the end of each month we'd pay the teacher for his service. Tuan Syed accepted any form of payment. Some of us would give him $1, some gave 50 cents, others gave him a plate of rice or sugar.

Beforehand, I\u2019m already a fan of the animation series; Kampung Boy. But I think this book and the television version is a little bit different. Or is it from another book?By the way, Mat Som got me really hooked up with Datuk Lat\u2019s drawing, characters, humour and also beautiful messages in his work. And,Kampung Boy is not any less wonderful. Not at all. :) And yes, now I understand why this book became one of the references for foreigner to learn about Malaysian life. Our multiracial country has a wide variety of custom and tradition but somehow I feel we all can relate to this book. At least I can and I came from the other side of Malaysia (Borneo), not in Lembah Kinta and I certainly never been to rubber plantation before or even growing up in the same era as Mat.

From his birth to his journey to boarding school, this kampung (village) boy enjoys his life. Nothing special happens in this graphic depiction of life in a Malaysian village in the 1960s, but the normal boy pursuits (fishing, hanging out with friends, getting in trouble with mom), are portrayed with great affection and humor. The village, however, is changing with the times, and as the boy leaves for boarding school, he and the reader are left wondering if there will be a village for him to return to. Lat, the author, is noted as one of the most popular cartoonists in Southeast Asia, and it's easy to see why. His simple line drawings are wonderfully expressive and his backgrounds brim with the everyday details of life that make the kampung come alive. Students in fourth grade and above will enjoy Kampung Boy and will eagerly await the U.S. publication of the next in the series."}, {"userName": "Yulianto Qin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/187116-yulianto-qin", "userReview": "Lat adalah salah satu komikus favorit saya. Gaya gambarnya yang sederhana sekilas seperti buatan anak-anak membuatnya memiliki karakter yg khas. komik kampung boy ini merupakan 'slice of life story' yang menggambarkan kehidupan sehari-hari si komikus semasa kecil di kampungnya. Petualangan mencari ikan di sungai, menjaga durian di kebun, sunatan, sampai tingkah nakalnya menjadi pendulang timah liar diceritakan dengan jenaka dalam gambar-gambar yang sederhana tetapi memukau. Membaca kampung boy membawa saya kembali ke masa kecil di kampung juga. kesederhanaan polah tingkah tokoh Lat kecil membuat komik ini cocok untuk semua umur. Tak ada plot yang menegangkan (hanya sedikit keriuhan ketika lat kecil dihajar bapaknya karena menjadi pendulang timah liar) maupun cerita yang genggap gempita tetapi kita tetap bisa menikmati alur cerita yg sederhana ini. lat sungguh mumpuni dalam merangkai gambar dan kata yang sederhana menjadi cerita yang meluluhkan hati pembaca segala usia."}, {"userName": "Mia Kay", "userReviewDate": "Dec 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70328419-mia-kay", "userReview": "guys, lets get back to our malay root.

A graphic novel, it illustrates the boy's life in pictures and words. Aside from being the protagonist, Lat is also the narrator. The story opens with his birth in a kampung in Perak, Malaysia, and the traditional rituals surrounding the event: the recitation of blessings, the singing of religious songs, and the observance of ceremonies. As Mat grows older, he explores the house, gradually shifting the story's focus to the comic activities of his family outside their abode. The book is full of experiences the Kampung boy goes through such as reading the Quran and learning to fit in with his new friends and even his new little brother. The company will offer a large sum of money for the family's properties if they discover tin on it. Other villagers are hoping for similar deals with the company. They plan to buy houses in Ipoh if their hopes are realised. The day for Lat to depart the village has arrived and he is excited, but as he is about to depart, sadness washes over him. He acknowledges the emotions as his love of the village and hopes that the place where he was born will remain unchanged when he returns.Overall, I loved this book cause I was ale to relate to it because I am Malaysian. My grandma is from Perak and she lived in the Kampung all her life. I was able to understand phrases and jokes that other readers may not understand. This book is very famous in Malaysia because of its detailed illustrations andThe book made Lat an international figure and a highly regarded cartoonist in Malaysia. It won several awards when released as Kampung Boy in the United States as well. I loved the simple but interesting plot, and the illustrations were in black and white. He was able to create drawings that weren't in color interesting full of shapes. You were able to grow up with the Kampung Boy and experience things like living in the village."}, {"userName": "Dani Shuping", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5031502-dani-shuping", "userReview": "Lat takes us on a journey of his childhood growing up in the Kitna Valley in Perak in the 1950\u2019s. Lat is master storyteller as he takes us down the wandering path of his memories showing us the ceremonies that were still practiced--such as asking the local teacher to take on students, the feeling of swimming in a river as the cool water washes over you, and the warmth and somewhat craziness of family--like the dad that takes off his shirt to scratch his back on the pole when he gets home from work, caring for siblings, and the discussions of future. But the modern world is gradually approaching with tin dredges and trains and automobiles. And Lat is about to head off to school in another town away from his family.This book is done in a sketchbook style, with written descriptions of the events and illustrations accompanying them. The deceptively simple illustrations are compelling and catch that slice of life that seem to be missing in many modern comics. He doesn\u2019t hesitate to illustrate what life was really like growing up for him, even if it means depicting his own backside as he and his friends strip down to take a swim in the river. Most importantly even though Lat illustrates how things are different in his world, there is much that is similar to our own way of life. The time spent with family and friends, the time spent at school..the more things seem to be different the more there is that is the same.I highly recommend this book and it's sequel (Town Boy) to anyone and everyone, but particularly to the younger generation. Not just as a chance to illustrate the differences between cultures, but a chance to illustrate the similarities between them."}, {"userName": "Danya Itani", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28163723-danya-itani", "userReview": "Kampung boy is a novel about a baby who is born in the Kampung village of Malaysia. The book begins by the birth of the baby and begins explaining the celebrations and rituals that they do. It explains how they dress the baby and how they take care of him. Then since the family is Muslim they explain the traditions they have. Not only does the book have a sense on religion but education and daily life as well. As soon as the little boy grew up his father put him in a religion school, there he met other boys and became friends. Him and his friends would go fishing and do adventurous things like swimming in the river. This book is very entertaining even if you're not a comic person you should go for it. It wasn't a hard book but it was surely fun to read. Because the comic is in Malaysia and is based on a Muslim family I felt that I could somewhat relate to it since I live in an Islamic country, and I have been to Malaysia myself and have many Malaysian friends. In conclusion is comic exceeded my expectations and everyone can learn something from this book, weather its something about Malaysia, Islam, or family, since the little boy lives in the love of his family."}, {"userName": "Aisyah  (\u00b4\uff61\u2022 \u1d55 \u2022\uff61`) \u2661", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13615508-aisyah", "userReview": "Aww.. si comel MatBuku ni menceritakan kisah hidup Mat di kampung sewaktu dia kecil pada zaman 50-an.

(2006). Kampung boy. New York: First Second. Fiction. In this book, which was first published in Malaysia in 1979, Lat shares the story of his childhood in his small village, or kampung, during the 1950s. From his birth and adventures as a young boy, to his education in the village, making friends, and his eventual leaving of the kampung for boarding school, Lat sweetly, and authentically brings his kampung to life. There is an authentic portrayal of his rites of passage, such as his hair shaving ceremony soon after birth, to his Muslim upbringing as he begins lessons in the Koran at age six. Authenticity is furthered as Lat states that he is able to see a rubber plantation from his window, and often hears the roaring sound of a tin dredge. At the end of the story, when he must leave for school, readers are left with the feeling that there are more books to come that reveal what happens next to this loveable young man.Lessons: This is a good book for students exploring other cultures.
