My usual go-to genre is historical fiction, however, and I didn't expect to be blown away and deeply inspired by it. But I very much was. I will try to find words to adequately describe this wonderful work...First of all, Tyndall is blunt and honest. If you don't want to hear about the sinfulness of the church in the end times, about believers being persecuted, and the level of unrighteousness in society, you will be challenged. If you are made uncomfortable by biblical concepts of miraculous healings, speaking in tongues, and other works of the Holy Spirit, you will be challenged. If you don't believe spiritual warfare, with demons and angels in a battle for humanity, you will be challenged. But if you read it with an open heart and allow the Spirit to speak to you through Tyndall's words, you will be inspired to seek God like never before and you will be awakened to the reality of Christ's return. As for the characters: Angel is an admirable protagonist, with very realistic struggles and victories. Daniel is also portrayed realistically, for he does not always do the right thing or act wisely. However, their story is interesting and engaging. The plot moves and the book is simply riveting! I loved how the storyline was presented...it kept me on the edge of my seat! I could not rest until I finished it. I adored the different places where the novel took place, like the beach, and no matter what the place was, I felt like I was there. Of course, the whole end-times setting is fascinating in this novel, and rather attention-grabbing.The ending was the very best part. I'll not say what it is, so you will have to find out for yourself! But I wept with joy and longing and my heart was moved.This amazing work by Tyndall is a must-read and contains a message that the Church desperately needs to hear. Even if you may not agree with everything, When Angels Cry deserves your consideration and attention. You will not regret reading this one.

Angelica Smoke, a single mother and cocktail waitress, ascends the steps of a megachurch to deliver a message from God to the one man she hoped never to see again.That message thrusts world-famous pastor Daniel Cain into a whirlwind of confusion, causing him to seek out Angelica and demand an explanation. But the woman broke his heart once and is now involved in a fanatical cult. Even being seen with her could damage his career. Still, he cannot stay away, and the more time he spends with her, the more he begins to doubt everything he believes.Angelica is a seer. God grants her visions of the future, but she has no idea what to do with them. Her top priority is protecting her son---from the world, the culture, the devil, and especially from Daniel. But God keeps throwing them together, causing her fears to rise and reopening old wounds that threaten to tear her soul apart.Angels watch over the couple, protecting and hoping they will make the right choices. But the angels are limited in what they can do as the end of the age comes to a close and the spiritual battles intensify, not only for Angelica and Daniel, but for all humanity.\u2018When Angels Cry\u2019\u2019 is a great read and also one that causes the believer to pause and think about the end times. Reminiscent of Frank Peretti\u2019s \u2018Piercing The Darkness\u2019 and \u2018This Present Darkness\u2019, books which I have read twice already, and also of the Left Behind series, Tyndall paints a picture of this time so clear and vivid that it is powerful and amazing! The book is a totally compelling read. Tension abounds in the pages of this novel and it will very definitely give one pause to think about the end of this age for those in Christ. And those who are not. I finished the book in tears. It will cause you to long for Heaven. Truly it will.

We are definitely in the end times and there are so many lost souls that still need to be reached. What is our role? What can we do? How far are we willing to go? Will we let fear stop us from doing God's will? Or will be stand up...swords at the ready...and fight to save those souls until time runs out? The images that are imagined in this book had me enthralled, and at times, on the edge of my seat.

For when a novel is so powerful and compelling that it has the potential to save and transform lives, all while delivering a fast-paced, unpredictable, suspenseful romance\u2026then it is not a book to be missed!Set in the not-too-distant future, the world as we know it is drawing near to a dramatic end. Biblically-prophesied signs and wonders are shaking the world, and yet many continue to live in deception soaking up the lies of the world. Including the world-famous charismatic pastor Daniel Cain, who preaches a diluted gospel to thousands, unaware his own light has also drastically weakened. Daniel still cares deeply for ex-girlfriend Angelica, but he refuses to listen to her and her friends who illegally witness on the beach. He knows if he is not careful, she could bring his charmed life crashing down. So what will it take to bring him to his knees before the Almighty?Angelica knows God\u2019s voice well, sees easily into the spiritual realm, and frequently receives visions. But when God tells her to speak warnings to Daniel, the man who broke her heart, she struggles to obey. Angelica has a strong faith, but like many of us she also has flaws and weaknesses. When dire threats and terrifying danger begin to overwhelm Angelica and she is fully tested by her greatest weakness\u2014can she find the faith to overcome?MaryLu Tyndall\u2019s \u2018When Angels Cry\u2019, gripped my spirit and instilled within me a renewed passion to pray for the lost. It was also a much needed reminder of the principalities and powers in high places that persuade and deceive the masses. This battle of light and dark is so very real! The author of this book helps us to see the unseen. End-time scriptures scattered throughout and at the conclusion will have you devouring the Word anew. For all that I thank you, MaryLu Tyndall. This book has an exciting Peretti flavour and a chilling relevancy to current times!

This story is so realistic today of what is happening in the church and how the world views us Christians. If you like stories that make the modern Christian look politically correct, than this might be a novel for you to read and take a hard look at. I enjoyed how Tyndall made me want to grab my Bible and share even more with those I encounter on a daily basis. I really enjoyed getting to know the main heroine. She was an inspiration with her ability to share her faith without any doubt or fear. She knew who she trusted and placed all her hope in him. I truly loved this novel and have passed it on to my fifteen-year-old son. Hopefully, he will see the need to keep growing in Christ and the need to share God's light with ALL his friends.

She has to be diligent with her son and teach him about Christ, she also has to watch his friends to make they will not make a negative impact on his life. Bibles are outlawed. Everything a person does is monitored. And God\u2019s footsteps are ever closer. God gives Angela dreams and visions. One of those dreams is to give her an assignment. Although she doesn\u2019t like it, she obeys. She gives Daniel Cain his message and feels her assignment is finished.Daniel Cain\u2019s life is altered after Angela walks back into his life. He is a high-powered pastor. On the fast-lane for Washington D.C. But all of it changes when God has a message for him. Daniel wrestles between light and darkness. I absolutely loved When Angels Cry. Not since the Left Behind Books has a book about the End Times made a huge impact in the Christian book selling market. I can see this book having a total impact on people! What MaryLu wrote is so important, people need to know there is a definite battle between light and dark, demons and angels. It made me even question myself, and how I've let so much get me down lately...despair, depression, loneliness, health issues, financial issues, the loss of family, etc. - that I haven't honestly given thought to my spirit life and how all of it is affecting me. We are also seeing so many signs of Him calling us home, that we need to make sure we are right within ourselves. One thing that really stuck with me - narrow is the way but wide is the gate. It was like lightning bolt moment and my eyes were opened! Wow!The only objection I had with this book, was the slang language. I know many Christian authors are using it more now in their books. A lot of them do not see it as bad language but I have a differing view. Although MaryLu used it in her book to show it as how far the pastors slipped in their walk with Christ. I still was not comfortable in seeing it in a book that I was reading. Here is another example of how Christians are being blinded by the darkness of this world. If we can read a book with slang language and call it okay then what is okay? Where do we draw the line between good and evil? As Christians, we cannot be riding the fence any longer, we need to have both feet facing towards heaven. Not an easy concept but we can do it! I sure do want to be left here after the rapture!I am not allowing it to dissuade me from review. Despite this, it is still a very powerful book. One that so many need to be aware of. So, I had to wrestle with myself \u2013 do I give this book a four-or-five-star rating? I decided to give her the four-star rating because of MaryLu\u2019s intense writing of this book, the truth of demons and angels, how well-written and thought out the book was. This could not have been an easy book to write, and I am sure MaryLu had some battles writing it!

Fiction . . . yes, but profoundly prophetic. Angelica (Angel) Smoke has been marked by God to be a messenger to the last person on earth she wants to interact with. Daniel Cain, a prominent preacher, just so happens to be her ex-boyfriend. They were an item when Daniel was a seminary student, and she was a cocktail waitress. Despite their difference, they fell in love and planned to marry. Unfortunately, an argument led to their break-up, and forced them to go their separate ways. Twelve years later, Angel is a single mother, still working as a cocktail waitress in order to make ends meet, and loves the Lord with all her heart. She hates her job, but has no choice. The world is an ugly place that has outlawed the Bible, evangelizing, and hunts down those who don\u2019t obey the law. Angel continues to tell others about Jesus\u2014even as she serves them liquor\u2014because she is confident God will protect her as she tries to be a witness and messenger of His. With a message given to her by God, Angel goes to see Daniel. When she confronts him with God\u2019s message, he doesn\u2019t even recognize her, which is fine with Angel. She did what God asked, and now she can move on with her life. Or so she thinks.Daniel Cain is a very successive preacher of a mega-church in Florida. His good looks, charisma, and \u2018positive\u2019 message of love and acceptance has garnered him a flock of over twenty thousand. His career is on an upward trajectory, one that could lead to a job in the White House. At first, Daniel doesn\u2019t recognize Angel when she tries to give him a prophetic message from God. But then, he sees her again, and becomes obsessed with her. Angel accuses Daniel of losing his first love\u2014that the \u2018positive\u2019 message he\u2019s preaching is NOT the Word of God\u2014and he needs to open his eyes to how distorted the world has become. He\u2019s reminded several times by Thomas\u2014his friend from college who also knew Angel\u2014that spending time with her is going to derail his career and ruin everything he\u2019s worked for. But, Daniel is convinced, somehow, someway, they can still make it work.As angels and demons spar in the spiritual realm, the time of decision is drawing to a close. Angel senses the urgency and continues to see Daniel, even though her life, and the life of her son are being threatened. This outline just scratches the surface of WHEN ANGELS CRY. There is so much more to the story that will keep you turning page after page. One of the most fascinating sections of WHEN ANGELS CRY is the segments told from the perspective of the angels protecting Angel, Daniel, and those around them. These angels know what\u2019s coming and wants their charges to turn before it\u2019s too late. But they can only protect; they cannot interfere. WHEN ANGELS CRY also shines a light on the demons who are in this world, always close by, waiting for any opportunity to destroy whomever they can. Though WHEN ANGELS CRY is steep in spiritual warfare, and prophecy, the romantic facet is well represented by the chemistry between Angel and Daniel. They are meant to be together, but is it meant to be?A fascinating, provocative, thought-provoking book. A real leap in genre for Ms. Tyndall, but she executes it flawlessly.Disclaimer: I receive complimentary books for review from publishers, publicists, and/or authors, including .

I was completely captivated from beginning to end. Though it is fiction, adventurous, and romantic \u2026 it is also a possible scenario and insight of what the end-times \u2018might\u2019 just look like \u2026 based on Scripture.MaryLu has spent years of personal research into the Bible and end-time prophecies. The Word of God is quoted throughout this book. And the characters and story portrayed, are meant to be as close to the truth as possible.Angelica (our heroine), has a gift from God \u2013 visions of the future, and, the ability to peer into another realm. When God asks her to deliver an important spiritual-related matter to Daniel, (former boyfriend), now a famous Pastor of an extremely large \u201cWorld Super-Church\u201d (though not preaching/teaching from the Bible) \u2026 Angelica does not want to be a part of this. However, her obedience and love for God wins over, and she delivers the message. They begin to spend more time together (NOT Angelica\u2019s preference), and Pastor Daniel is both attracted to her, and, appalled by her life \u2013 that of being free in the Spirit, and practising \u201cBiblical\u201d truths \u2013 from the Bible, founded from the early Church.In this story, many Scriptural practises have now been banned, outlawed. No preaching or teaching from the Bible; no witnessing in public; and every sinful way of life has now become \u201cthe norm\u201d -- \u2018acceptable\u2019. No person is to be offended or excluded \u2013 everyone welcome, NO matter what life-style they choose to live. But NOT all believe that way.Throughout the story, many signs and wonders occur \u2026 just like the Bible predicted they would. Time is running out. Angelica is trying desperately to convince Pastor Daniel to hear and follow the truth and change back to his original roots \u2013 the \u201cBible/Word of God\u201d, before it is too late.Then, the \u201cfinal trumpet blows\u201d ... and the true-believers are called Home. Did Pastor Daniel heed the calling of God? Did he listen? Did he accept the Truth? Or go back to the original Scriptures, to learn God\u2019s heart and teach from His Word? You will need to read this book to find out the surprise ending ! This novel is a major eye-opener, and a challenge for sure. It convicted me (not condemn me) \u2026 to try to lead a life more pleasing to God, and, to try to speak up whenever possible to the people God puts in my life and path. It is not only a cry from MaryLu\u2019s heart -- to challenge both the Christian-believers of today to \u2018wake up\u2019 and realize the end is near, and, for non-Christians to \u2018open their eyes, ears and heart\u2019 \u2026 but I truly believe it is the cry from God\u2019s heart.Very touching, moving, and sincerely written by Mrs Tyndall. 5 Plus Stars !!!Brenda Hurley"}, {"userName": "Ian", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5077041-ian", "userReview": "There is so much to like about this story. Angelica Smoke, the lead character, is really well developed by Tyndall. We see her struggles, her victories and most significantly the growth in her faith through the story. Angelica has a special gift: she sees the supernatural. Angels and demons activities. She also has vivid dreams, many of which are prophetic in nature. Angelica is a single mom and cocktail waitress, called by God to encourage an old friend/boyfriend, Daniel Cain, who is a big-time pastor of a megachurch. But the novel is set in end times and the church and Bible is different now. Watered down. All the hard things have been eliminated. So Ps Daniel's message is also watered down. Angelica has been called to challenge Ps Daniel with the idea that he needs salvation. And before it's too late.The story revolves around Angelica and Daniel's growing friendship and how her faith impacts him. She doesn't want to have a friendship with him because she is hiding a secret from him that she doesn't want to reveal. Daniel is falling for her but his right hand man, Thomas, won't have anything of it as she is from the wrong side and is an unwed mother.I really enjoyed Angelica's faith journey. She struggled trusting God with her son, Isaac, which was fascinating reading. Don't we all struggle giving everything over to God? I enjoyed reading Angelica's passion for sharing the love of God with everyone she met, even customers at her bar. I loved how she listened to the Spirit's prompts and obeyed accordingly. I enjoyed her interactions with her angel and how she used what she saw in the supernatural to lead her prayers. And I enjoyed seeing the odd miracle or two.Tyndall's description of Daniel Cain's church was fascinating as it probably reflects a little of where some of our western churches are heading. Too much emphasis on material blessings and not enough focus on relationship with Jesus and spiritual formation.The angels and demons have very minor involvement in the story which I found a little disappointing. In particular, besides a very brief paragraph or two at the end, the angels didn't really do anything but stand around, watch and commentate on what was going on. The story ends with a Big Bang that I wasn't really expecting which I enjoyed and is worth the wait.Recommended for all those who enjoy a bit of supernatural in their fiction."}, {"userName": "Victoria", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32137154-victoria", "userReview": "I was honored to be chosen to read and review this book.

The issue with demons, I'll admit, had me spooked a little. Their descriptions were so vivid that you have no trouble picturing them. Some of the things we battle with daily like fear, jealousy, greed, envy and so on are dealt with in a way in which you really have to take a minute to stop and think about how we handle these things. Do we listen to the negative thoughts and let them totally overshadow the good positive ones? Hmmm, something to think about! I loved the fact that there was an angel with the characters in the book watching over them all the time.

Even in her job as a cocktail waitress, Angelica brings God's Light into the middle of the darkness and, although she doesn't always realize it, has eternal significance in the lives of those she talks to. I could go on but you just need to read this book! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"}, {"userName": "deb", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10475616-deb", "userReview": "When Angels CryThis story has me examining myself and that is a good thing. I know that I always want to be on the Lord's side and not compromise. It is interesting how we can compromise something and not really realize it.The events that take place in this book let you know that you can't be complacent in your relationship with God. I wanted to cry because I knew some of the characters in this story were headed towards destruction. I wanted to have the fearless faith of Angelica, a God chaser.When Angels Cry, proves that you are going to have to be totally sold out to the King to survive these last days and not everyone who claims to be a Christian will enter into the kingdom of heaven."}, {"userName": "Angelica McDonald", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18490740-angelica-mcdonald", "userReview": "Ok, this might be a long post because I am a SUPER HUGE FAN of Mary Lu Tyndall. I enjoy reading her novels because she is not afraid to expand the norms of Christian fiction and to take it up a notch. However, I have to admit that before buying this book I was nervous about how she was going to write about this topic. If you have read (I sadly, haven\u2019t) or at least watched the Left Behind series (the one with Kirk Cameron), this novel is somewhat similar in how it revolves around the Rapture. Yet, after reading this I have to say she is a master...Read the rest on my blog:https://bookaholicloungeblog.wordpres..."}, {"userName": "Dorianne Swift", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70032099-dorianne-swift", "userReview": "Will be anxiously waiting for a sequel! (Hint hint!)When Angels Cry is a thought provoking read! Left Behind meets Piercing the Darkness in this up to date look at possibilities we face in the End Times, with a flavor all it's own. It really makes me conscious of what seems so little an ability on my part to share Jesus in my pretty isolated walk is magnified when the Father plants those seeds and makes them grow!

I finished with tears in my eyes and a stronger desire to pray and watch for the Lord's return and the rapture. It is exciting, with good character development, surprising twists in the plot and lots of encouragement and with a hope that shines through. You get a glimpse into the spiritual realms and warfare that rage around us without our notice. I love her imagery as the main character witnesses to people. MaryLu has used her spiritual imagination and come up with a book to rival \"Left Behind\" of so many years ago. You can pre-order the book now at a reduced rate so go get it. You won't regret it.

This story fictionalizes how the days leading up to the rapture might look. I aplaud the author for speaking out and using her voice to make people aware of what is coming. The book itself moved very rapidly and I was amazed the author could fit it all in! On that note I wished it could have been a little longer and a little more fleashed out, but I still think it is worth 5 stars. My favorite imagery was the two different brides, that will stay with me."}, {"userName": "Hanna", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69146820-hanna", "userReview": "This was a very interesting book! The portrayal of angels and demons reminded me of Frank E Peretti\u2019s books (This Present Darkness-series, which I enjoyed).The ending really took me by surprise, it was not what I expected.It made me dive into the book of Revelation instantly after I\u2019d finished, because I was intrigued by the events of the last days, and wanted to see which I could recognize from When Angels Cry. Definitely a thought-provoking read, even if it wasn\u2019t quite what I\u2019d expected!"}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3401865-nancy", "userReview": "This was not an easy book for me to read... the angels weren't the only ones to cry. I, as a Christian, know we are in the last days & know the signs that were given. It's just so very hard to read a book that describes the heartbreaking events & attitudes that so closely parallel what is happening now. The hope that shines through by story's end should inspire those truly seeking His will. Thank you MaryLu Tyndall for being like Angel & telling it like it truly is!! Your courage & love inspires me!!"}, {"userName": "Shonda", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57553833-shonda", "userReview": "This was a very good book! I can see how we are living in the last days. I love how much Angelica loved God and would not give up trying to reach people for Christ. This book will make you stop and look at how what is going on in the world today is getting close to what is going on in the book. Daniel\u2019s relationship with God was done very well, this is talked about in the Bible.
