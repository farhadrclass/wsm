Unicorns. Picking authors who can write and have a lot of interest in the genre, as opposed to those who are popular, really paid off here. (The only exception to this assumption is the opening short story by Cassandra Clare. But I guess there was no way to avoid that as Clare is currently considered to be the shining beacon of YA steampunk and thus assigned as the main attraction in this book.)The subtitle of the collection is An Anthology if Fantastically Rich and Strange Stories, and indeed it's not a lie, this book is full of imaginative and original stories. My vision of what \"steampunk\" is is pretty pedestrian and looks something like this:++For the most part, the authors cater to such \"vision\" and a few even manage to bend it to their purposes and create some darn good stories. Although there are some who think that using words like \"engineer\" or \"gadget\" once or twice in a story is sufficient to make it steampunk. I disagree, but what do I know?Now to the stories themselves.My most favorite in the collection, without contest, Dylan Horrocks's Steam Girl. It's a sweet story about a developing friendship (and maybe more) between a lonely boy and a new girl in school who calls herself Steam Girl and tells strange tales about her inventions and various steampunky interplanetary adventures. Are her stories real or imaginary?The other shorts that caught my attention:Libba Bray's The Last Ride of the Glory Girls - about a gang of girls who rob trains using a clockwork that stops time. This story is so good I wouldn't mind reading a whole book about the Glory Girls and their adventures.In Clockwork Fagin by Cory Doctorow limbless and mutilated children injured by steam-powered machines who live in an orphanage get rid of their evil master and substitute him with an automaton.Next two stories are both ghostly and with the most feminist flare. The main character in Ysabeau S. Wilce's Hand in Glove, Constable Aurelia Etreyo, seeks both respect from her male colleagues and justice for an innocent man accused of multiple murders. The narrator of Delia Sherman's The Ghost of Cwmlech Manor, a servant girl who dreams of becoming an engineer, helps her master to find hidden treasure with some help from the resident ghost.Calling Elizabeth Knox's Gethsemane steampunk would be a stretch. But this story about 4 strange people caught in a natural disaster is so curiously and intricately written that I am willing to forgive the deficiencies in steampunk department. I loved how life stories of the characters intertwined and transformed, rolling into one another.The collection also has two successful post-apocalyptic pieces. In Garth Nix's Peace in Our Time and Christopher Rowe's Nowhere Fast steampunk future is, respectively, a cause and the effect of the downfall of the civilization.The two graphic stories (Shawn Cheng's Seven Days Beset by Demons and Kathleen Jennings's Finishing School) presented in Steampunk!: An Anthology of Fantastically Rich and Strange Stories while provide some diversion from prose are pretty negligible.My least favorite stories, in the descending order of my enjoyment, are: Kelly Link's The Summer People has absolutely nothing to do with steampunk. It's a tale about a girl's quest to rid herself of the fae folk she is bound to serve.The Oracle Engine by M.T. Anderson is set in a AU Ancient Rome and involves a future-predicting machine used for revenge.Both Cassandra Clare's Some Fortunate Future Day and Holly Black's Everything Amiable and Obliging have good ideas (the first one is about time reversing and the second - automaton-loving), but are too unpolished, unappealing in terms of writing and character development. It might be a matter of personal taste though, I have never liked anything written by either of these authors.All in all my experience with this collection has been very pleasant. Even the weakest short stories in this anthology are very readable. I recommend."}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2276205-kelly", "userReview": "Steampunk!: An Anthology of Fantastically Rich and Strange Stories is a new young adult collection edited by veteran anthologists Kelly Link and Gavin J. Grant. Featuring twelve conventional short stories and two graphic entries, Steampunk! showcases a wide variety of ideas and styles that fall under the steampunk umbrella. The collection is entertaining and is lent extra freshness by the variety of settings explored by the authors: none of the stories are set in Victorian London.The book begins with \u201cSome Fortunate Future Day\u201d by Cassandra Clare. This is a creepy little story about a rather warped young girl who desires love but knows very little about it. The ending will leave you wondering, \u201cHow many times\u2026\u201dSet in an alternate Wild West on another planet, Libba Bray\u2019s \u201cThe Last Ride of the Glory Girls\u201d follows a girl who goes undercover with a gang of female outlaws and finds her loyalties shifting toward them and away from the Pinkertons she works for. The narrative voice is terrific \u2014 I kept imagining the story being told by Hailee Steinfeld \u2014 and the religious cult that haunts her past is chilling.\u201cClockwork Fagin\u201d by Cory Doctorow is set in an oppressive orphanage for children maimed in factory accidents. Their keeper meets his untimely end, and the kids see a chance to seize their own destinies. The story is macabre, a bit twisted, and darkly funny, and ends in a surprisingly uplifting way.The first of the two graphic entries is Shawn Cheng\u2019s \u201cSeven Days Beset by Demons.\u201d I don\u2019t think I quite \u201cgot\u201d this one. I had trouble liking the protagonist, and while I enjoyed other stories in the anthology that revolved around unsympathetic characters, this one didn\u2019t give me much to sink my teeth into except the emotional state of the protagonist. His reactions just seemed way overboard in regards to how briefly he\u2019d known his love interest, but I\u2019ll grant that this may have been an intentional decision related to the story\u2019s Seven Deadly Sins theme.Ysabeau S. Wilce offers a tale of early forensics and mad science in \u201cHand in Glove.\u201d A detective struggles against her fellow officers\u2019 reluctance to embrace newfangled methods of crime-solving as she investigates a mysterious murder spree. An enjoyable story.\u201cThe Ghost of Cwmlech Manor\u201d by Delia Sherman is a charming entry, a Gothic ghost story with a mechanical twist. It\u2019s beautifully written and doesn\u2019t go quite where you expect it to, in large part because of its spirited heroine who chafes at restrictions of both gender and class.Elizabeth Knox\u2019s \u201cGethsemane\u201d is set in the South Pacific but is based, at least in part, on the 1902 eruption of Mt. Pelee in the West Indies island of Martinique. Knox follows four characters, each of whom has a story, and each of these stories is made up of a complex tangle of truth and lies. The lies start to unravel as disaster strikes Gethsemane, and the truths discovered are often tragic, but the process of learning them is satisfying for the reader.\u201cThe Summer People\u201d by Kelly Link is a story of fairies in Appalachia. The steampunk connection is a bit tenuous \u2014 you could remove the steampunk and still have essentially the same story \u2014 but it does provide a clever new look at why one shouldn\u2019t take certain metals along while visiting the fairies. Even though it\u2019s really more of a fairy story than a steampunk one, \u201cThe Summer People\u201d is haunting; I think I\u2019ll remember its twist and the rooms of the fairies\u2019 house for a long time.Garth Nix\u2019s \u201cPeace in Our Time\u201d centers on an old man who at first seems doddering and innocent, but whose role in a horrific cataclysm unfolds gradually as he is interrogated by a young woman. An interesting character study.Christopher Rowe\u2019s \u201cNowhere Fast\u201d is set in Kentucky in a post-apocalyptic future. Anti-technological beliefs have taken over, to the point of becoming repressive. Into this setting comes a young man in a device that isn\u2019t at all exotic to us, but is shocking to the townspeople: a car. I thought this story was going somewhere darker than it actually went, but it\u2019s a thought-provoking look at how any philosophy can be taken too far.The second graphic entry is \u201cFinishing School\u201d by Kathleen Jennings. Engaging and well-drawn, \u201cFinishing School\u201d tells the story of a famous aviatrix\u2019s first flight as seen through the eyes of her childhood friend, now a dentist. I enjoyed it and wished there were more of it; I wanted to see more of both women\u2019s lives.\u201cSteam Girl\u201d by Dylan Horrocks is set in our own time, as a teenage boy falls slowly and awkwardly in love with a geeky, outcast girl in his class. They bond over the graphic novels the girl writes, which relate the adventures of Steam Girl, an author avatar whose life is filled with planet-hopping high adventure. Meanwhile, they face bullying at school, and it also becomes evident that the Steam Girl yarns are more closely tied to their creator\u2019s troubled real life than one might expect. \u201cSteam Girl\u201d is an absolutely beautiful story in which any high-school pariah \u2014 current or former \u2014 will see a little bit of him or herself. (ETA: And I want to tell Shanaia that It Gets Better for geeks too! Get thee to a SF con, girl. You'll be beating off suitors with a stick.)Next is Holly Black\u2019s \u201cEverything Amiable and Obliging.\u201d This story is set in an alternate Regency England where automata are employed as domestics and in other subservient positions. The narrator\u2019s cousin falls in love with an automaton, and the narrator tries to scuttle the romance by proving the automaton is incapable of love. Like \u201cNowhere Fast,\u201d this is a story I thought was going to go darker than it did. Black paints a disturbing scenario regarding the sentience (or not) and the free will (or not) of the robots, but ties it up in a way that seems fluffier than is warranted by the themes.Closing out the anthology is M.T. Anderson\u2019s \u201cThe Oracle Engine.\u201d Anderson places his entry in an ancient Rome that never was. It\u2019s much like the real, historical Rome \u2014 but these Romans have more advanced technology. They have flying machines, and it\u2019s implied that they nuked Carthage. \u201cThe Oracle Engine\u201d draws on the real-life history of the consul Crassus and uses that as the foundation for a terrific story of revenge. If you know your Greco-Roman mythology, it\u2019s not hard to guess where this story is going, but Anderson makes the journey irresistible. (Also includes a great joke that's ostensibly about an order of male Vestals dedicated to the oracle engine, but is really a little poke at present-day computer geeks.)Steampunk!: An Anthology of Fantastically Rich and Strange Stories is a solid anthology well worth picking up by any young adult (or not-so-young adult) reader interested in the steampunk genre. Especially satisfying were the complex characters who populate these tales and the diverse range of settings. My personal favorites were the entries by Link, Horrocks, and Anderson, but I thoroughly enjoyed the whole collection and have discovered some new authors to try."}, {"userName": "Jonathan Peto", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4107370-jonathan-peto", "userReview": "Short story anthologies are tough. This one is a strong three stars. Even though there were no lost causes, as I read I never thought I'd give it four. Some stories soared, but I guess not high enough or long enough.Another thing, and it is a Catch-22, but I found myself impatiently flipping pages at times, wondering how many remained. I longed for novels, I think. I wanted the stories to draw me in faster and deep, some did, yet I was still impatient, wondering when it would end.One last thing. Steampunk? This was a good introduction. Turns out I've read some steampunk (Philip Pullman). Even though I will read more steampunk, including some of these authors, I did tire, at times, of reading this all at once. I appreciate the effort to develop speculative fiction, fantasy, and not emulate Tolkien. I like the machines and the respect for mechanical skills, but am not entirely convinced including those things alone makes a distinct genre. Some of the stories contained more of those elements than others.Brief, perhaps idiosyncratic and unhelpful, responses to each story:\"Some Fortunate Future Day\" by Cassandra Clare: Included dirigibles. Wartime. Abandoned female lead who may amuse and/or appall. Ambiguous ending? Mostly enjoyed.\"The Last Ride of the Glory Girls\" by Libba Bray: Interesting world. Strong female leads. Orphans. Rebellion. Ambiguous ending that may satisfy. Mostly enjoyed.\"Clockwork Fagin\" by Cory Doctorow: Read one of his novels. Orphans. Rebellion. Murder. Mostly enjoyed.\"Seven Days Beset by Demons\" by Shawn Cheng: Comic. Deadly Sins. Enjoyed.\"Hand in Glove\" by Ysabeau S. Wilce: Still plan to read one of her novels. Murder. Horror. Female detective lead, mostly strong. Mostly enjoyed.\"The Ghost of Cwmlech Manor\" by Delia Sherman: Mystery. Admiration for rank. Strong female lead. Mostly enjoyed.\"Gethsemane\" by Elizabeth Knox: Less steampunk perhaps. Dirigibles. Technology goes very wrong. Female lead who perhaps sells out. Ambiguous ending. Witchcraft. Googled the author. Enjoyed.\"The Summer People\" by Kelly Link: Also one of the editors. Less steampunk perhaps. Female lead who may be evil. Sinister. Mostly enjoyed.\"Peace in Our Time\" by Garth Nix: May be too cute. Selfish old man. Okay.\"Nowhere Fast\" by Christopher Rowe: Googled the author. Bicycles. Enjoyable female lead. Community. Memory. Longing. Enjoyed.\"Finishing School\" by Kathleen Jennings: Comic. Harder to draw me in. Somewhat strong female leads. Less developed but it may just be me and comics.\"Steam Girl\" by Dylan Horrocks: Googled the author. Setting seems to be our world. Steampunk elements are mainly in the a story within the story. Sensitive \"loser\" boy saved by \"loser\" girl and her story. Mostly enjoyed.\"Everything Amiable and Obliging\" by Holly Black: Read a novel by this author. Strong female lead. Technology goes wrong. Slightly disturbing topic of machines and love. Enjoyed.\"The Oracle Engine\" by M.T.Anderson: Strong narrative voice. Flying machines. War. Men. Revenge. Twists. Enjoyed.I enjoyed the stories. I guess something about their execution kept me from being completely drawn in? This could easily be four stars for some/many people, I suspect. All these authors are writers to keep an eye on."}, {"userName": "\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043a\u043e\u0432", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2018", "userURL":

I love the fashion it has inspired, and the subculture around it, and I want to love the fiction. I haven't read a whole lot of it yet, for various reasons, and what I have read hasn't always worked for me. This anthology, though - put together by Kelly Link and Gavin Grant, coming out from Candlewick Press - makes me very happy indeed. It might be the fact that it is aimed at the YA market that helps it hit the mark so well. It takes the notion of steampunk and does some seriously mad things with it. There are outrageous characters, unexpected settings, and some wonderful wonderful narratives. With very little fog and few bowler hats. There are a number of outstanding stories. I read Libba Bray's Going Bovine a while back and fell in love with it, so seeing her name in this ToC was like following the scent of chocolate. \"The Last Ride of the Glory Girls\" is, indeed, simply glorious. Girl outlaws, clockwork, friendship, religion, love, and a tantalising world - it's all here. Adelaide is adept at working with various clockwork contraptions and ends up working for the local law enforcement. As such she goes undercover, and... things proceed. The characters are charming (mostly); the plot unfolds at a brisk and enjoyable pace; and the few hints that Bray drops about the world make me want to email her right now and DEMAND a novel set in this place. The narrator's voice added to my delight with the story, too; Bray takes a chance on using a slang ('were' instead of 'was', etc) that could have seemed forced or unnatural, and manages to make it both consistent and lilting rather than jarring. This is a seriously good story.Kelly Link contributes \"The Summer People,\" and while I absolutely adore it I admit that I don't really understand its place in a steampunk anthology. There are some minor aspects that I can see tying into the theme, but they don't really seem important enough to make this story really fit the genre. Anyway - I'm not actually much of a one for hard 'n' fast genre delineation, so whatever. It's a brilliant story. Fran is left to look after herself, the house, and the family business while sick, when her dad decides to go and get right with God. She enlists the help of a former friend, Ophelia, and the two end up spending more time together than Fran had expected. Link gets a lot of interesting issues into this story. The relationship between the two girls is a complex one, based on family status and origin and expectations; Fran's relationship with her father is certainly a complex one; and there are suggestions that things in the wider world are going pear-shaped. Both Fran and Ophelia are very readable. This is another world about which I would devour a novel-version in a heartbeat.Another story framed around the relationship of two unlikely friends is \"Steam Girl.\" Using the story-within-a-story trope, Horrocks has the freaky new girl telling stories to the loner nerd at her new school. It's a wonderful, stunning mash of the indignities of being new and weird at school - oh, adolescent nightmare - together with a rollicking adventure worthy of Verne (there are dirigibles, and interplanetary jaunts). New girl and nerd work brilliantly, while the jock and the popular girl made me have flashbacks. Unlike the previous two stories, this one really works perfectly at this length, I think because the world itself was familiar. \"Nowhere Fast\" was written by Christopher Rowe, and in reading it I had to double-check that I wasn't back reading Welcome to the Greenhouse, because its steampunk-ish-ness comes as a result of climate change and the end of oil. A stranger, a car, and a young woman questioning her upbringing all illuminate a world where treading lightly on the earth is the paramount virtue. There are interesting familial relationship at play here, as well as friendships, and a sly comment on local vs national power structures, too.Finally, the anthology finishes with \"Oracle Engine,\" by MT Anderson. Over the last few years I've had discussions with a fellow Roman-history-fan about the lack of 'Romanpunk' in our lives. Of course, she has since written a collection of short stories with that very title... and Anderson's story fits into that as-yet-uncluttered subgenre. It's based on true Roman events - those surrounding Crassus, richest man in Rome, and his rivalry with Pompey and Caesar; Anderson makes it fit the theme by making this a Rome like the alternate histories of Cherie Priest, Richard Harland or Scott Westerfeld's efforts in steampunkland. Also, he adds an oracle engine (duh, hence the title), and that's just cool. Plus Minervan Virgins, sly Roman jokes, and a style reminiscent of Roman historians. A worthy end to the anthology indeed."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4139457-jennifer", "userReview": "Overall, a solid compilation. A couple of stories weren\u2019t steampunkish enough (Link\u2019s) and/or compelling (Knox\u2019s). Even Garth Nix\u2019s entry was just a short shaggy dog story, as it were, though the punch line did make you think. But there were far more excellent tales than not. Clare, Bray, Doctorow, Rowe, and Black kept true to the theme and turned out enjoyable and imaginative stories. \u201cThe Oracle Engine,\u201d with its basis in Roman history, was interesting for a while, but it soon became obvious what was going to happen. (Though if you haven\u2019t read anything about the Greek oracles and how their predictions were misinterpreted \u2013 most famously, the \u201cwooden wall\u201d of Athens \u2013 then the resolution might be a surprise.) \u201cHand in Glove,\u201d Wilce\u2019s detective story, was a blast to read; I longed for it to be a novel or a series of stories \u00e0 la Sherlock Holmes. Sherman\u2019s ghost story was somewhat predictable yet captivating nonetheless. But my favorite by far was Dylan Horrock\u2019s \u201cSteam Girl,\u201d with its two likable, equally interesting characters, and a plot that keeps you enthralled and as off-balance as the narrator. It\u2019s a superb work, and one that could have been the title story in the collection (i.e., Steam Girl and Other Steampunk Stories).The best thing about Steampunk! is that the editors made good on their promise to explore and expand what steampunk means, giving us a set of stories that avoids repetition of setting, plot, or character.

I'll admit I saw this listed in my feed, saw the link to read it and took some odd minutes to read it. To be honest, Rose was a bit too self-absorbed for my liking, so I didn't like her, but there were parts of this story that were interesting, and I think the automatons were a nice touch, though I felt like there was still more to the story needed, even with the freakish ending (and yeah, I consider it freakish for a number of reasons).Full review:\"Some Fortunate Future Day\" was a short story under 5,000 words that was featured in the Steampunk compliation by Kelly Link and Gavin Grant. I've read a few of Clare's short stories and found some of them worth the brief reads, but while there were some interesting ideas with this particular story, it wasn't my cuppa. I think part of that might've been the rather brash and absorbed character of Rose, who lives among a group of automatons while waiting for her father to return home from war. She happens upon a stranger who ends up stranded near her home and nurses him back to health. She also falls madly in love with him. Yet when circumstances aren't to be and she blames herself for not making herself appealing to him...well, I think one can read the ending for themselves and get the idea. I'll admit it was interesting in a twist, freakish way, but the execution didn't quite draw me in for lack of connection. I liked parts of the tone, which had a dark coloring and almost keen desperation on the part of Rose. I also liked the personalities of the automatons. The setting was well drawn for the brevity, but didn't quite draw me into the story completely.I think it was worth the time taken to read, but not one of my favorite stories on the whole.Overall score: 2/5"}, {"userName": "Tzu-Mainn Chen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29853114-tzu-mainn-chen", "userReview": "I've been struggling to understand what 'steampunk' means. A month ago, I'd have mentioned such words as 'Victorian', 'invention', 'pipes', and 'weird' before giving up and muttering 'steam' and 'punk'. This anthology has its share of all these things, but as I read through these stories - many of them good, a few of them great - I realized that steampunk is more than its accoutrements. It's an almost spiritual belief that technology can achieve miracles, wonders, and perhaps even transcendence. This is illustrated in what I consider to be the best of these stories, 'Steam Girl', in which the highly imaginative tales that one lonely child tells another prove to be the awakening and salvation that both of them need.Not all wonders are bright though. Another standout story, 'The Oracle Engine', explores an alternate Rome during the period of the first Triumvirate, in which a wronged child seeks his revenge through the use of his invention, the eponymous Oracle Engine. There are many other good stories, and that renders the not-so-great ones both forgettable and inconsequential.\"I was ten or thereabouts\", narrates a character in one of the stories, \"and I was mad for wonders.\" I think there is a need for a little bit of that madness in all of us, and 'Steampunk!' fulfills it admirably."}, {"userName": "Chelsea", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33012180-chelsea", "userReview": "Not my favorite anthology.

I wish I liked Libba Bray but I always lose interest in her stuff very quickly.Clockwork Fagin by Cory Doctorow: This one followed children injured by the steam powered machines that live in an orphanage and end up rebelling.

I\u2019m not sure if I really got this\u2026 It was about an artist who falls in love with a girl who doesn't love him and it really has no resolution at all.Hand in Glove by Ysabeau S.

I liked this well enough, as I love ghost stories.Gethsemane by Elizabeth Knox: A natural disaster story that's only kind of steampunk. It was okay, nothing in particular stood out to me.The Summer People by Kelly Link: This was one of my favorites even though it basically isn't even steampunk at all. It follows a girl bound to serve the fae. I really liked the way it was written.Peace in Our Time by Garth Nix: I don\u2019t really know what was happening here. I tried to read Nix once before, and I really just don't care for his style.Nowhere Fast by Christopher Rowe: This one was set in post apocalyptic Kentucky, and another story that was just fine at best.Finishing School by Kathleen Jennings: The second comic story. It details the story of a woman's first flight. It was alright as well, not much to say about it.Steam Girl by Dylan Horrocks:Really cute my favorite one and had the best writing style of all of them.

While I have not loved all of the steampunk novels I have read to this point, I have uniformly enjoyed the idea behind them, the out-of-place mechanization accepted as normal in an otherwise old-fashioned society. What attracts me most to this, I expect, is the similarity between steampunk and magical realism, the only difference being that the magic lies in the technology.With such thoughts in mind, I was eager to read this anthology, particularly considering that some authors I already enjoy contributed stories, such as M. T. Anderson, Cassandra Clare, Libba Bray and Cory Doctorow. In fact, these authors cap the anthology. It begins with the stories by the three I listed last and ends with M. T. Anderson's tale.Despite what should have been a strong beginning, I found the start of the anthology utterly tedious. I did actually Clare's, Bray's and Doctorow's stories, but none of them blew me away. Then, the next four stories I found to be completely awful, the anthology not picking up in quality again until Kelly Link's story, which, while interesting, really did not seem like steampunk so much as science fiction or fantasy, depending upon where the summer people came from.The latter half of the anthology, though, was totally satisfactory. I enjoyed all of the stories but the graphic novel Finishing School. Speaking of the comics included (Finishing School and Seven Days Beset by Demons), why were they so awful? I love that comics were included and applaud the blending of formats, but really think they could have found something better. Seven Days Beset by Demons was by far the worst story in the anthology, for it lacked plot, carried a heavy-handed religious bent and did not particularly smack of steampunk. Epic fail.The best stories, in my opinion, were \"Steam Girl\" by Dylan Horrocks, \"Everything Amiable and Obliging\" by Holly Black, and \"The Oracle Engine\" by M. T. Anderson, the final three stories in the anthology. I must admit I am a bit biased against most of the others, because I quickly tired of reading the poor grammar of western characters, who say things like \"I done seen them people.\" No thanks.If you hate that all steampunk takes place in Victorian England and want to see where else it can be set, then you'll enjoy this wide range of interpretations (although personally, I found the ones in a modern setting a bit odd). Be prepared to slog through a couple of long stories that you might not be especially interested in.

It speaks to the masterful craftsmanship and artistry of the contributing authors (and editors) that this anthology felt so cohesive while, at the same time, no two stories were even remotely alike. Yes, the thread of steampunk binds them together, but the interpretations of what \"steampunk\" really means are as varied as the pegs inside M. T. Anderson's oracle engine. This dark, gritty, sumptuous anthology is a must-read.P.S. If I had to choose a favorite? Probably Kelly Link's \"The Summer People. What I wouldn't give to return to that story world!

While there were a few stories that made me wonder why they were being considered steampunk, I enjoyed all of them. Okay, so Seven Day Beset by Demons was a let down, but that was the only one.These authors are not steampunk authors, or even genre writers. Where so many steampunk writers seem to think of the world before the story, these are simply authors who have taken on the concept of steampunk and used it to accent a story, and for that, the impact and dept of the world is so much more potent. I think fans of steampunk and readers who are new to the genre will both find this a fantastic collection.Also, the cover is really, really pretty.Some of my favorites are:The Last Ride of the Glory Girls by Libba BrayClockwork Fagin by Cory DoctrowThe Ghost of Cymwer Manor by Delia ShermanFinishing School by Kathleen JenningsGethsemane by Elizabeth Knoxand The Summer People by Kelly Linkbut really, everything in here is good.

Kelly Link and Gavin Grant went out of their way to do that with this delightful YA anthology. I love that the stories are set in Appalachia and Canada and Australia and ancient Rome, and that they intersect with the tropes of time travel and alternate world fiction, among other subgenres. The YA protagonists also provide a refreshing perspective on the genre. My favorite pieces in the book were Cory Doctorow's \"Clockwork Fagin,\" Cassandra Clare's \"Some Fortunate Future Day,\" Shawn Cheng's \"Seven Days Beset by Demons,\" Kelly Link's \"The Summer People,\" Christopher Rowe's \"Nowhere Fast,\" and Dylan Horrocks' \"Steam Girl.\" I think I've just named half the book.

'Clockwork Fagin' (Cory Doctorow) surprised me with its extremely satisfying ending and the two graphic novel pieces were also a pleasant surprise. Most of the stories were 'meh -- interesting idea but, meh' (including, disappointingly, those by Garth Nix and Cassandra Clare, whom I know are better storytellers than their truncated tales gave them credit for). I liked that (as the intro says) most of these stories are set 'anywhere but Victorian London', again making the case for steampunk as a whole world-building mindset rather than an aesthetic.However, there were two outstanding stories, and these most prove (I think) the above point.'The Last Ride of the Glory Girls' by Libba Bray was my absolute favourite, and I wish there had been more of it. Not in a bad 'what-just-happened' way but in a 'I could happily read and entire novel about these characters in this world' way. It was brilliantly invented, masterfully strung along, and -- after falling out of love with the Gemma Doyle series a little while ago -- reminded me why I loved Bray's writing style in the first place; unique fantasy worlds artfully and eccentrically conceived and populated by genuine characters that feel flesh-and-blood. An absolute treat from start to finish.The other was Kelly Link's 'The Summer People' -- another modern tale, that focused (beautifully, and as not so many of the other stories chose to) on the maker aspect of steampunk. It was Link at her wacky finest (just this side of bizarre) and although reading it barely felt like steampunk (where were the dirigibles? where the bombs and rubble? what about the crazy-flawed science and the gaslit crinolines?) it was perhaps the most truly steampunk of them all -- make something quirky-beautiful out of whatever bits you've got to hand, and 'BE BOLD, BE BOLD, BUT NOT TOO BOLD' (these words are forever etched on my brain. I may get a tattoo.)Whatever particular brand of steampunk you favour, there's something in this collection for everyone and even those stories that I wasn't keen on gave me something new and interesting to think about in the many ways that authors can play around with the same basic building blocks."}, {"userName": "Lolly's Library", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2649865-lolly-s-library", "userReview": "Like most anthologies, the stories within Steampunk! fall into three categories: Fantastic, Mediocre, and Bloody Awful. I will give the authors and editors credit, though, in that, for the most part, they're not your average steampunk. Not only are most of the stories not set in the traditional Victorian London milieu, the stories have settings ranging from Appalachia, Canada, New Zealand, Wales and beyond, from ancient Rome to futures both bleak and fantastical.Here's a breakdown of those stories which I feel fall into the first and third categories I described above. First, the Fantastic:--The best, most stand-out story of the entire collection was the very last one presented. Oracle Engine by M.T. Anderson concerns a steampunk-flavored ancient Rome (so creative!). The story could've easily come off as cheesy or hokey, but the storytelling, along with Anderson's incredible attention to even the smallest historical detail, makes for a riveting tale. In fact, I really wish Anderson could find a way to turn his short story into a novel or series of novels. His steampunk Rome is a city I would love to revisit.--The Last Ride of the Glory Girls by Libba Bray. Set in the wild, wild West (kinda; when you read it, you'll understand) and revolving around a gang of girl train robbers and the Pinkerton men (and girl) chasing them, this is a rip-roaring train ride of a story. A well-written and super fun tale.--Clockwork Fagin by Cory Doctorow. As its name implies, this is a riff on the whole Oliver/orphanage/mistreated waifs theme, with a deliciously inventive and satisfying comeuppance for the miserable orphan master. Richly detailed and immensely satisfying.--Hand in Glove by Ysabeau S. Wilce. As I was reading the anthology, this was initially my first choice for favorite story. This piece, above almost all others in the compilation, perfectly captures the wild inventiveness and creative storytelling necessary for a successful steampunk tale. Beautifully told, with vivid imagery, this is C.S.I meets steampunk and it's stupendous.--The Ghost of Cwmlech Manor by Delia Sherman. A ghost story in a steampunk setting. Now that's creative! Set in a manor house in the Welsh countryside, this is a charming little tale with perhaps not that much depth, but nevertheless entertaining for what it is.--Steam Girl by Dylan Horrocks. A wonderful story-within-a-story revolving around the familiar alienation/high school-is-hell theme, with superbly entertaining results. Steam Girl is a heroine for a new generation and I would love to see more of her adventures (not to mention Rocket Boy's), especially in a graphic novel, a medium big enough and colorful enough to contain Steam Girl's exuberance.--Everything Amiable & Obliging by Holly Black. One of the few stories set in London (in fact, I believe there was only one other story with a London-setting), this is a sugared violet, petit four treat of a confection. That's not to say it's lightweight, however. The story delves into the murky realms of what it is exactly which makes a person a person. A delightful tale with unexpected depths.The Bloody Awful:--Seven Days Beset by Demons by Shawn Cheng. A short story told in graphic novel-fashion. Now, I understand the steampunk angle as the M.C. (a vendor) peddles little clockwork vignettes. But the story itself is poor. Yeah, yeah, I get the whole 'missed opportunities due to stupid self-indulgence'; that still doesn't mean the story was done well or entertaining, which it wasn't...at all. Plus, the ending was abrupt and not satisfying, not to mention the artwork was childish and not at all creative, in my opinion.--Gethsemane by Elizabeth Knox. First off, I don't see how this qualifies as steampunk. Other than a mention of some steam works and an airship (neither of which are all that uncommon in real life, needing the fantastical touches of clockworks, automatons and other creative additions in order to make them steampunk), the story has no connection with the genre. Secondly, as it concerns a witch and a zombie, the story belongs more to the straight fantasy genre, as there's no steampunk element to either of the two characters, explaining their condition or motivations. As to the plot, it's nonsensical and pointless, with no clear direction. On a technical level, the writing is fine, quite lyrical; it's just wasted on a poor story.--The Summer People by Kelly Link. Now, to be perfectly honest, this story isn't Bloody Awful; however, it is another story which really doesn't belong in this anthology as there's nothing steampunk about it, which is why I'm including it in this category. Apart from the mention of some clockwork mechanical toys, which aren't inherently steampunk unless placed in context, the tale revolves around fairies. Appalachian fairies, but fairies nonetheless. Unlike the story above, however, this one is actually quite good, with excellent writing and a creative plot. Had I encountered it in a fantasy- or fairy-themed anthology, I'd be singing its praises as a real winner. However, steampunk it ain't. It just doesn't belong.--Finishing School by Kathleen Jennings. Yes, this one is steampunk and has the elements of that genre in abundance. What it doesn't have is a storyline. What little story exists is confusing, disjointed, and just plain hard to follow. Even the fact that the tale contains elements of real-life incidents doesn't help clarify the action. Very poorly done.--The absolute weakest link of the anthology was the very first story, Some Fortunate Future Day, by Cassandra Clare. Now, I've never had the (pleasure?) of reading any of Clare's books, though I have heard the numerous critics who call her a hack. Judging from this (thankfully short) example, I'd have to say those critics are on to something. A piece of fluff, with apparently very little thought or creativity put into it, I wonder at the editors' decision to include it. For example, the M.C. is named Rose and another girl integral to the story is named Lily. Really? How clever, naming both girls after flowers; that's realistic and, boy howdy! what a stretch of the imagination. The best thing I can say about this piece is that it takes very little time or brain power to get through it. Shallow and insipid.I have to say, out of the 14 stories contained in Steampunk!, there was a greater-than-average ratio of dreck to gems, for which I'm extremely grateful. Kudos to the editors, for while they could've done better, they also could've done a helluva lot worse."}, {"userName": "Madelyn Grace", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10686312-madelyn-grace", "userReview": "I have really been on an anthology kick lately, this the fifth this year.

One of the things that's so refreshing about Steampunk! is that its diversity of setting, story, character, format. Something that was achieved by asking the anthology's contributors, whose ranks include both big names and virtual unknowns, for \"stories that explored and expanded their own ideas of what steampunk could be\" (8).I read Steampunk! over the course of a month or six weeks. While I know that anthologies aren't meant to serve as a unified whole, I usually prefer not to read them straight through. I do almost always read the stories in the order they are presented, but I like to be able to sit on one before I start the next. I quite enjoyed being able to read Steampunk! leisurely.I would like to say that each of the works collected in Steampunk! was absolutely wonderful, but I can't. Elizabeth Knox's \"Gethsemane\" caused me vexation; I didn't \"get it\" at all. I think I was too tired when I tried to read it and it's one of the longest stories in the anthology so I decided to skip it, fully intending to revisit it at some point before posting my review (that is until I realized that my e-galley was about to expire). Other than that (and please do note that the fault might very well be my own), the anthology was full of win.[footnote]At the moment my favorite story of the bunch is Dylan Horrocks' \"Steam Girl.\" I didn't expect to prefer this one because it is (at least in my opinion) one of the least steampunk contributions to Steampunk!3 (the titular character's alter ego exists in a imaginary? steampunk world, but she and the story's protagonist are firmly planted in the realistic here-and-now). \"Steam Girl\" is, however, perfectly crafted.I should also note that Steampunk! is geared toward the young adult market unlike the steampunk anthologies of which I am familiar.Steampunk!'s table of contents, with links to extracts when available (my favorites are starred):  \"Some Fortunate Future Day\" by Cassandra Clare \n   \"The Last Ride of the Glory Girls\" by Libba Bray* \n   \"Clockwork Fagin\" by Cory Doctorow* \n   \"Seven Days Beset by Demons\" (comic) by Shawn Cheng \n    \"Hand in Glove\" by Ysabeau S.

An Anthology of Fantastically Rich and Strange Stories is just that and anthology of fantastically rich and strange stories and so I gave each story a different rating but the average comes out at 4 stars.So to the stories,Some Fortunate Future Day by Cassandra Clare:5 starsThis story was fantastic and just a brilliant start into the book. As you all probably know I love Cassandra Clare and even in this short story I love her writing and storytelling technique. I'm not going to spoil anything about the story so you're just going to have to take my word for it that it's a really good story!!!The Last Ride of the Glory Girls by Libba Bray:5 starsGod, I'd love to be a Glory Girl. This story was so fantastically told and even the way the characters spoke it was like being sucked back into an old western. But the story itself was fantastic, the plot, the characters, and we even get to see the back story of the main protagonist in very convenient flashbacks. An amazing short story and I can't wait to read more from Libba Bray and so the next book I'm reading is A Great and Terrible Beauty!!Clockwork Fagin by Cory Doctorow: 5 starsThis was like an Oliver Twist retelling and that was the first thing I thought of when I read the title. But unlike Oliver Twist, this story was gruesome in it's ways and even had me cringing at some points but overall definitely one that would keep you hooked.Seven Days Beset by Demons by Shawn Cheng: 3 starsHmmmm, I wasn't sure about this one. It was a comic and I have never really been interested in comics. The artwork was fantastic, I just didn't get the story behind it. So, 3 stars.Hand In Glove by Ysabeau S. Wilce:4 starsThis has to be the most craziest story in this anthology. It was crazy and the twists were completely unpredictable. I'm not going to spoil any of it but damn it was unbelievable!!The Ghost of Cwmlech Manor by Delia Sherman:5 starsI have to say I'm a sucker for big mansions and maids and all those old stories so this one definitely had me at the first word and then the prospect of a ghost being thrown into that mix. It was absolutely fabulous and then some romance, a mystery, the bad guys and it just made the story complete. Definitely one of my favourite stories, but I have a lot of favourites in this book!!!Gethsemane by Elizabeth Knox:3 stars This was one of my least favourite stories in this book. It was just a bit dull. Even now, trying to recall it amongst the other stories I'm coming up with a vague blank. So ya, I didn't like this story that much.The Summer People by Kelly Link:4 starsOhhhh I loved the inventions in this story. It was just that the storyline was a bit vague. I didn't think we got enough information about the makers of the inventions \"The Summer People\". I'm not even sure what they even are. Then the ending was very confusing but overall it was a very interesting story.Peace In Our Time by Garth Nix:3 stars This story was quite short but got stars from me because of the whole assassin plot. Overall it was ok, not overly interesting but still quite good.Nowhere Fast by Christopher Rowe: 4 starsThis was quite interesting to see a world where people no longer use cars or anything like that because of the affect on the environment, but then there are the revolutionaries that are the opposite. It was a good story overall.Finishing School by Kathleen Jennings: 3 starsFinishing School was another comic and I think that I'm not one to really enjoy comics. I understood the story of this one and what was happening and the artwork was really good but still I don't like comics.Steam Girl by Dylan Horrocks:5 starsSteam Girl was absolutely amazing and I was left questioning what was happening next at every point. Whether the main protagonist was the girl in the stories she told or was she just creating these stories. And boy, were her stories amazing and just the general plot of this was great. This quote was one that stood out to me the most:\"Some writers write to escape reality. Others write to understand t. But the best writers write in order to take possession of reality, and so transform it.\"Everything Amiable and Obliging by Holly Black: 5 starsI love this story!!! The prospect that automatons could have feelings just like living humans really stirred an emotion in me. But this story was written amazingly and I love the love stories of this story.The Oracle Engine by M.T. Anderson:5 starsI loved the history behind this story and the twist and the machine of revenge. I can't say much about this story without spoiling it so you're just going to have to trust me when I say it is really good!!"}, {"userName": "\u27b8 Gwen de Sade", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13454735-gwen-de-sade", "userReview": "This was incredibly disturbing and creepy.

I'm not the person who picks up a book of them and gets excited. However, I figured this book would be a good intro to the steampunk genre. I have to say, I like it better than any other book of short stories I've read. While I didn't fall in love with all the stories, I didn't want to skip any of them either. Below you will find a short review of each story.Some Fortunate Future Day:I really don't like Cassandra Clare. I sludged through her books because a friend loved them. That being said, I really liked this story. It's just the perfect amount of creepy, the idea of a child holding this man's fate in her flawed hands is too perfect for words. Definitely give this one a read, plus it's really short.The Last Ride of the Glory GirlsAnother great one. It's like a steampunk space western. I'm not sure if that was the intent, but I loved it. It's the sort of story where you are rooting for the bad guys(girls) and I always love those. Both the present story of the girls, and the flashbacks of the main character are beautifully written and compelling.Clockwork FaginI'm a sucker for orphans, so this one pulled me right in. My only complaint would be that the main character came across as much younger than he was supposed to be. Otherwise it was a fun look at the wronged orphans taking charge.Seven Days Beset by DemonsI might have liked this more as a story instead of a comic or manga. There just wasn't much too it.Hand in GloveInteresting story with a Frankenstein-like twist. Constable Etreyo was feisty and easy to root for as she tries to prove a man's innocence. I found the mix of early police work and advanced clockwork/magic in this one to be very fun instead of slipping into unbelievable. The Ghost of Cwmlech ManorAnother favorite! Ghosts and clockwork together make for an exciting story. Tacy is a great main character, full of curiosity and vigor, ready to take on a ghost or become an engineer in her own right. She's the kind of lead female you can sink your teeth in and happily out yourself in her shoes.GethsemaneI really do love the way magic and science are melded in most of these stories, even in this one where the magic is more of an act than anything else. I also loved the reference to Knox's Dreamhunter books in this story. (Her contribution to this book was another reason I read it.) She easily builds characters in just a few pages with back stories that turn the main characters into living people you feel for. My main complaint about this one is that I wanted to know more about them even when the story was over!The Summer PeopleThis was both a favorite, and my least favorite. I loved the idea that the clockwork devices came from fairies and the idea that this human girl was supposed to take care of the fairies. However, the story just ended too abruptly with too many unanswered questions. I felt like pages were missing. Peace in Our timeBasically a one scene story with so much more behind it. A brief tale of how one man can destroy a world. Interesting enough, but left me wanting something more.Nowhere FastAn interesting look into the future where steam powered devices have taken over where our oil driven ones left off. Though this is only true for the government because every day people must tread lightly on the earth. Somewhat post apocalyptic without ever going over the edge. Overall, I liked it.Finishing SchoolThe second comic in the book, and the better of the two in my opinion. Takes place in Australia and follows a determined teenage girl as she building a better air ship in order to show up those who try to oppress inventors. Steam GirlThe saddest of all the stories. You never really know if the girl is from our world and making up stories and her own inventions, or if the story she is telling is true. Either way, I walked away from this story feeling sad for the girl.Everything Amiable and ObligingHolly Black, another writer I've never really gotten into, and I love this story. Such a great twist on the idea of falling in love with someone below your station. Also some truly disturbing ideas about what we would do if we really could make life like automatons!The Oracle EngineGreat little story. I think it succeeds best because it is pretending to be a true history of Rome, and I found myself believing it. Playing to the roman tales of revenge, this one takes that theme and runs with it. Overall a satisfying end to the collection of stories.Each of these stories had it's moments of greatness. Some were riddled with clockwork and airships, while others had only an inkling of them, but they were all great. I would recommend this book to anyone who has the slightest interest in the genre!"}, {"userName": "Shaheen", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6967599-shaheen", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this collection of steampunk short stories from YA authors. It is a really entertaining read and perfect for when I had a few minutes and didn't want to start a new book. Unfortunately, the stories from the authors I already know were largely disappointing, with the notable exception of Libba Bray, and I was impressed with stories by a lot of authors whom I'd only vaguely or never heard of before. Overall a really nice read, and well worth the money I spent.Some Fortunate Future Day by Cassandra ClareI liked this story, but it was ultimately quite predictable. The incident with the rabbit was really creepy though, and I loved the dolls. Some how I expected more from a C. Clare short story, especially since it's the first one of the anthology. The Last Ride of the Glory Girls by Libba BrayThis was awesome, tightly written and engaging. I liked the charcters, and the whole story had a warmth to it that I enjoyed. It was also a lot longer than the previous story, which allowed it to get into some nice character development and world building. Clockwork Fagin by Cory DoctorowReally well written and fun, with a great narrator. The story is well thought out and although it has a conveinient ending, the desperation and tenacity of the orphans is readily beliveable. Seven Days Beset by Demons by Shawn ChengA cute graphic short story about a young man who sells mechanical devices, who is in love with a woman who doesn't feel the same way. I love the way that each day corresponds to one of the deadly sins, it's very clever. Hand in Glove by Ysabeau S. WilceMy favourite story so far, told incredibly well and with likeable characters. I thoroughly enjoyed this one and wish it was longer! Clever and creepy, and not one to miss.The Ghost of Cwmlech Manor by Delia ShermanI didn't like this one, it wasn't very enjoyable, and a little weird. More of a ghost story than a steampunk story to be honest. Gethsemane by Elizabeth KnoxAnother fairly disappointing story - mostly because many of the main characters didn't have names for a long time and it's hard to keep track of 'the boy', 'the girl', 'the woman' and 'the man' all the time. I liked the volcano though. The Summer People by Kelly LinkThis was wonderful! Wistful, magical and with a hint of eerie, this short story was the perfect read before bed :-) Peace in Our Time by Garth NixA quick, haunting story that showcased the brilliance of Nix's writing. I really enjoyed it, and I wish there was an accompanying novel-sized story.Nowhere Fast by Christopher RoweAnother quick story, set in a strange future, where cars (petroleum powered) are illegal. An interesting look at how the world may react to fuel shortages and environmental changes. Finishing School by Kathleen JenningsA fun graphic story about a young girl's determination to achieve the impossible, and her steadfast but realistic friend. Nicely told as a flashback so we can see how the succeeded in their respective dreams. Steam Girl by Dylan HorrocksOne of my favourite stories: bittersweet and incredibly detailed. I loved it, I loved Steam Girl and I wish there was more!Everything Amiable and Obliging by Holly BlackA somewhat disappointing story, mainly because Holly Black is so famed and well regarded, and this story fell ... flat. There was a lot to think about, but it was predictable and weird. The Oracle Engine by M. T. AndersonThis was set in an alternate Ancient Rome and was interesting to read. I liked the oracle machine and the concept behind the story, but felt sorry for all the characters. This is a really tragic story.

So, without further ado:Some Fortunate Future Day: this one was disappointing for Cassandra Claire standards. Of course it had some intriguing pieces with the time machine and the story about the war and the Rose's father, but Rose was a complete idiot. The dolls were my favorite though, because at least there was humor. The Last Ride of the Glory Girls: super interesting! I loved the glory girls and the narrator's story. The story was so well done and the world building was excellent. It just makes me wonder what happened to the glory girls afterward. Clockwork Fagin: Oh, how I loved this one! It's truly a story about the comradeship in an orphanage setting, but so much better executed because of Monty ' s character and the narrator's description of how he took charge. That, and the execution of Monty ' s plans were awesome.Seven days beset by Demons:Meh, interesting concept. I didn't find the drawings that appealing though, so the story wasn't really appealing.Hand in glove: A wonderful scientific murder mystery that's super complex to explain, but all in all presented interesting themes and a good story.The Ghost of Cwhmlech Manor: Goodness gracious me, what can be better than ghosts, legends, treasure, an odd adventure and a tentative romance that's not really written but obviously there? Nothing that's what.Gethsemane: I found this one a little hard to follow, but basically think Pompeii in a western time period with air ships and oil mines. The best story was with Mary and the guy that liked her despite her blindness. Reading about her was my favorite part.The Summer People: Very interesting and exciting because it had a fantasy vibe, but I'm dissatisfied because it feels like Kelly Link dropped the thread. It just could have been so much more, and the ending didn't even have to change. I just would have liked to know what happened to Ophelia and everything else after Fran went away.Peace in our Time: This one was a little freaky. A super old dude with serious hearing problem wiped out a whole culture I guess? Except for a few? And now they're coming back to take over earth? I'm not sure how to feel, considering that it could have used more back story.Nowhere Fast: This one was good. It sort of had a dystopia government vibe, and it's steampunk included airships and gas lamps. I liked Luz, and I wish I could read more about her a Fizz fixing the car and rebelling.Finishing School: An amazing graphic piece with two very diverse characters breaking out of the stereotypical Steampunk Victorian society. I wish this would be turned into a graphic novel for a more satisfying ending though. But it was still awesomely empowering even with the ending.Steam Girl: MY FAVORITE! IT HAS EVERYTHING FROM WRITING STORIES TO LOVE AWKWARDLY AND SCI FI LIKE GADGETS BUT STEAM PUNK, AND IT ALL ENDS WELL! And, the love interests aren't perfect, which was nice. Everything Amiable and Obliging: Also good, but very short. This did have a nice piece of romance, but I really didn't have time to get used to the idea of Valerian and Sophie together, so I didn't feel too attached to the idea. The idea of automaton feelings is interesting though.The Oracle Engine:This was super cool because it's like reading a piece of Roman history with machines, but there's not so much machine that it ruined the history. It was a little boring in parts, as history sometimes tends to be, but when Marcus Furius came back I was at the edge of my seat to see what he would do with Crassus, the miser who failed to help save his house and his family without payment. However, neither men deserved what they got in the end, even if Crassus was a greedy bastard. But that's history.All in all, I'm actually sad to be finished with this anthology and have to return it to the library. But, such is life. At least there are other books to turn to."}], "description": "Fourteen masters of speculative fiction, including two graphic storytellers, from Appalachia, ancient Rome, future Australia, and alternate California, create alternate universes where romance and technology reign.
