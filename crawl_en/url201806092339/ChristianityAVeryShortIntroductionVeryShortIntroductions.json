Woodhead does a commendable job at describing the basic tenets, growth, and culture of Christianity. I personally enjoyed her approach to the different types/forms of Christianity (Church, Biblical, Mystical) and how those three forms impacted growth patterns during the last two thousand years. Linda Woodhead MBE seems to have a soft-spot for both Feminist and Marxist approaches to history. This provocative approach might turn off some readers, but I actually think gender is a huge piece of the theological puzzle that needs to be explored whenever discussing the growth, doctrine, and history of Christianity. I also enjoyed how she discussed the relationship of the growth of the Early Church to the Roman (later Holy Roman) Empire and other developments later with the Orthodox Church's relationship with Russian, etc. This VSI wasn't a perfect capture of Christianity, but I'm not exactly sure how an historian/theologian could approach such a broad subject in such a short space without leaving major things out (aka religious traditions that seem to not fit easily within her big theory)."}, {"userName": "Scott", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/801669-scott", "userReview": "Well-written, with an interesting approach that contextualizes the different types of Christianity into three groups: Church (authority-oriented), Word (Bible-focused), and Spirit (personal relation with God's spirit). It's a good method of categorizing sects and showing their similarities and differences. She does exclude a number of significant Christian movements (Christian Science, Jehovah's Witness, Mormonism, for example), probably because they don't fit neatly into her groups. While the three groups are useful as discussion tools, she should at least acknowledge the sects that don't fit her model.I enjoyed her book, but it isn't really a primer on Christianity. It presumes significant understanding of principles, teachings, people, and history that one would expect to be covered in a \"Very Short Introduction.\".

The book talks about the enormous success of the religion that to date remains the most popular of all religions. It also mentions different flavors of the religion and how they parted with the mainstream religion. It was also interesting to learn how Emperors and Kings throughout history have used the religion to solidify and extend their reign.Despite Chritianity's enormous popularity, it is riddled with controversies, as is summed up in the following sentence --- \"At its heart are a series of paradoxes: a God who is also man, a teacher who lays down no laws, a holy book which is many books, a monotheism which is trinitarian, a religion of peace which is often violent\"."}, {"userName": "Daniel Wright", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14201179-daniel-wright", "userReview": "Very low-level, provides an interesting take on the subject which is probably not suitable for such a general introduction.

Most interesting for me was Linda's analysis about how Christianity had reacted to 'two modernities'. The first modernity linked to the enlightenment, lead to the rise of 'Liberal Christianity' - a process of demythologisation and emphasis on the rational & ethical. This was successful for a hundred years, but it seems now that this form of Christianity, particularly liberal Protestantism is dying. The second or late modernity, started in the 1960's was a rejection of all authority and a turn to the individual and subjective. This has been more difficult for Christianity to respond to. It seems that fundamentalist forms of Christianity are growing as a response to this new age of unfettered relativism.Very interesting read, an overview of Christianity that is fascinating to read, I'm not sure the narrative is totally accurate - I would be interested to read a Church Historians review."}, {"userName": "Lanterfant", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5481097-lanterfant", "userReview": "I am a big fan of the VSI series, and this is one of my favourites. There are many Christianities hiding under the umbrella term of Christianity, and Woodhead's typology of Biblical, Church and Mystical forms of christian religiosity is a very useful tool for bringing order in the vast multiplicity of currents. For a skeptic in religious matters like myself, the elucidation of the metamorphoses that Christianity undergoes in adapting to fluctuating social circumstances is highly entertaining, but the book is written from a perspective that can accomodate believers and non-believers alike. I liked the insight that a focus on the Holy Spirit and 'Christ within' in certain movements can be a means to self-empowerment that can be downright threatening to elites, and may thus be persecuted for this reason. The agency of believers and practicioners of the faith is stressed throughout the book, which is a good antidote to simplistic atheist conceptions of christians as mere 'dupes' of mechanisms of indoctrination.

But, I have to give the author high credit -- in only 150 pages she manages to give an amazingly detailed overview of 2000 years of christian cult evolution while still remaining very readable, not just a listing of facts and names with dates. Anyone who is a bit too orthodox or fundamentalist in their beliefs would not enjoy the book at all (as it will disrupt their ignorant bliss), but those who are curious about the actual history of the movement will get a lot out of this short work. Even those who have a fairly complete academic understanding of how the christian world developed and how it affected the history of Europe and beyond will appreciate this as a nicely done basic outline of how the religions that make up christianity evolved.

I would recommend this book for the laity or for students who are beginning their studies of Christian history.

I won't be using it in any of my classes becuase it's just too brief, and she uses categories that I'm not familiar with in other literature like \"Church\" Christianity and \"Biblical\" Christianity.The chapter on Christianity in Prothero's \"God Is Not One\" is probably more useful."}, {"userName": "Matt Hale", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11415840-matt-hale", "userReview": "It is apparent that Woodhead seeks to give an objective account of Christianity. What she gives is a muddled mess of generalizations and caricature that neither represents Christianity nor those who have contributed to it. Instead of reading this, read a book whose author admits a bias and seeks to understand the religion on its own terms."}, {"userName": "Angela", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34314564-angela", "userReview": "Disappointed in the lack of real content presented Was not pleased with the presentation of information as I found it very sporadic without any real direction.

Christianity addresses topics that other books neglect, for example the competition for power between different forms of Christianity, the churches' uses of power, and their struggles with modernity. Woodhead also considers the recent charismatic explosion of Christianity in Latin America, Africa, and the Far East. She concludes by showing the ways in which those who previously had the least power in Christianity--women and non-Europeans--have become increaslingly central to its unfolding story.
