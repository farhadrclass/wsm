These books are so addictive! I love Lisa Harris's writing, and it's great that the stories are squeaky clean, too. Plenty of thrills and danger without sensuality or curses. Happy face! Do yourself a favor: when you start book one, have two and three all lined up behind them. Definitely recommended.Nikki has a lot to deal with in this story. The main suspect appears to have his finger in every pie, yet is so charming and innocent in person that he couldn't possibly be the one...could he? Is there another plausible suspect with fingers in every pie? Harris definitely kept me guessing with the layered characters. Though the romance is still understated, it ticks up quite a bit between Nikki and her man. Also, though it's evident that Nikki is a reliever, there's less of a faith message than in the previous two books. But I'm okay with that because of understanding Nikki's faith from the other stories."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2521894-laura", "userReview": "First, the disclaimer. \"I was provided a free copy of this book. All opinions are my own.\" That done, PURSUED is, I think, the first book I've read by Lisa Harris, but I am greatly impressed. This suspense grabbed hold and held on through-out the entire book. Yes, I knew who the bad guy was. I knew why. But the suspense was in Nikki trying to find the missing key witness before the villain did. How did the witness disappear so fast? Even more scary is airline officials denied that anyone was even sitting in the seat next to Nikki after the airplane crashed... that seat was empty. Was the woman a figment of her imagination? I had to keep reading to see what happened next. And how it would play out. I haven't read any of the other books in this series, but this one easily stands alone. I maybe tempted to go back and read Missing and Vendetta though. Fans of suspense will definitely want to read PURSUED. There is no faith message and the romance is there, but only slightly."}, {"userName": "Staci", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11909124-staci", "userReview": "This third novel from the Nikki Boyd Files was action packed!

From the first exciting scene to the end, it all takes place in just a few action-packed days.  Nikki leads an exciting life as a missing persons investigator in Nashville. She is a good character, tough and smart, but compassionate when needed. Plenty of action and suspense with some gritty scenes, yet also some touching moments squeezed in that add inspiration and a little bit of a romantic interest carried over from the other books. Nothing sugar-coated or too sappy here. Third book in the series, but easily reads as a stand alone. Recommend! (Book provided by NetGalley and the publisher.

The book takes off with a bang, literally, as the flight Nikki is on crash lands and the woman in the seat next to her vanishes, seemingly into thin air. In the midst of all the turmoil, Nikki also has to manage some personal crises of her own, but her lasting faith in God is the anchor that pulls her through. I enjoy not only the suspense and thrill-a-minute aspect of Ms. Harris's books, but also the relationships, complex characters and trust in God that she manages to interweave effortlessly with the non-stop action.

After being slightly disappointed in the previous book, I was a little nervous that this book would also let me down...but it didn't and instead I was hooked and really enjoyed the story.

I really like both of those characters and seeing them in a relationship is great and makes me happy for them. :) The suspense was good and kept me turning pages.

Action fills the pages of this book from the start when the plane Nikki is traveling crashes upon landing and the woman sitting next to her mysteriously disappears.This suspense story certainly delivers. It seemed that every other chapter significant setbacks held the heroine from accomplishing her mission but I have to admit that by the time I got to the last ten chapters I was exhausted. And so I skimmed ... yeah, not entirely proud of that but I really just wanted to see the story end and the good guy win and the bad guy go down. The story doesn't slow down much if at all regardless of the interpersonal struggles the heroine is facing. I know this is suspense but I really, really wanted something more to happen between Nikki and beau Tyler. After all, in the last novel they were so close ... and then BAM! I have to wait until next book and yet here I am still wanting some closure or something more ... maybe I've been reading too much romantic suspense \ud83d\ude10. Regardless of my need for some romance, I did find the heroine's dismissive response to her family and friends post-plane crash (and several other life-threatening moments) a bit too much for me to empathize with. I get being all job-focused and whatever but I would've liked to seen Nikki respond differently--or at the very least a reasonable explanation besides a missing person case to keep her away from them. Even my soldier knows how important familial connection is post-traumatic events. The plot is full of crashes, explosions, and near-death experiences that will make suspense fans happy. The faith element isn't preachy but the heroine offers up prayer in her times of need, which at times felt superficial to the plot but authentic to the character. I think fans of Lisa Harris and Nikki Boyd will be satisfied with this new release and anxious for the next.***I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Maureen Timerman", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3840941-maureen-timerman", "userReview": "Can you imagine sitting next to someone on a plane and having the plane crash, you survive, but they tell you that no one was in the seat next to you?

In order to prepare to read this book, I did read the first two books in the series as I wanted to know what happened previously. The book does a great job in explaining what has happened in the past but I just like to read series in order. I'm glad that I did because I got to see how Nikki and Tyler's relationship grew over these books. Nikki has joined the Missing Persons Task Force after her sister went missing 10 years ago. She now knows how families feel when love ones go missing and she takes her job very serious. In Pursued, Nikki is sitting on a plane next to a woman named Erika Hamilton when the plane suddenly crashes. After the crash, Nikki was looking around for Erika but she seemed to have disappeared off the plane but in the seat Nikki has found Erika's watch.I don't want to give away any spoilers but you need to read this book in order to find out why Erika has disappeared and how Nikki feels bound and determined to find her. You will not be disappointed as the book is non-stop action and adventure. The characters are well-developed and the plot is an excellent one that will keep the pages turning unstoppable. Lisa Harris' writing is amazing as she weaves twist after twist down to the last page.I now look forward to book four as the suspense in these books is like a non-stop roller coaster and I can't wait to go for another ride.

With Lisa Harris's The Nikki Boyd Files, I have felt like that completely. With this series, I have returned to Nikki Boyd and her best friend, Tyler, and watched her interact with the mysteries that come across her lap.The writing is clear and concise. I can completely see the setting. I could feel the airplane turbulence in the first couple of chapters and held my breath as they crashed to the earth. Harris does a good job at bringing Nikki to life in the third installment of this series. While the novel features the same heroine, Harris has stayed true to who Nikki is. She didn't do anything that seemed out of character for me. Tyler, the returning hero, is a military man who is the type of man everyone would want in their life. He supports Nikki completely even when she makes dumb mistakes and keeps putting herself in the path of danger. But there were moments that he appeared to be kind of fake. Instead of stopping the woman he loves from chasing the bad guys, he shrugs his shoulders and moves on with his life.The top reason I enjoy suspense and thrillers is the fast pace of the novel while wondering who is the bad guy. With Pursued, Harris kept the action moving. Every time a chapter was about to end, Harris would throw Nikki into another harrowing situation where she had to run for her life or be caught in the cross hairs. I had a really hard time putting the book down. I stayed up way too late finishing the book, which I love. But I had a hard time believing that a number of bad things could happen to one person in a forty-eight hour period.As for the romance between Nikki and Tyler, Harris finally allowed them to come to terms with their happily ever after. It may have taken three books, but I'm glad to see them realize their ultimate relationship together.The plotline is has been done a number of ties, but I still enjoyed following the story even though the ending was pretty predictable. Similarly, the spiritual elements were not preachy. Nikki did pray for help from God when she was in a difficult situation. I highly recommend Pursued to fans of Lynette Eason, Christy Barritt, Patricia Bradley, and the fans of the first two books in Nikki Boyd's series.In conclusion, Lisa Harris' conclusion to the Nikki Boyd files is a non-stop story, begging for me to continue reading to see what happens to Nikki and Tyler as she races to the solve a missing person case.

There were references to what I assume happened in the other books, but there was enough explanation that it made sense. I also don\u2019t think the explanation would be boring to someone who has read the other books. I felt the author did a nice job with this.There were a lot of people who got killed in this book. At times it felt like a lot, but it did increase my adrenaline as I read the book and increased the stakes for Nikki.I was glad that the romance was most subtle, yet moved forward. Many times in these types of books I feel like the romance can get in the way of the story, but it did not do that here.The entire book takes place over a very short time span. I liked how the author gave the time and location at the start of the chapters. I found this to add to the detective aspect of the book. I also liked that the times weren\u2019t all even numbers, which made the chapter setup more believable.I was hooked on this story from the opening chapter. I did want the first few chapters to get moving because I wanted to find out about Erika, so it felt like it was moving a tad slow, but I think that was my impatience and the author doing a great job of making me yearn for answers.I\u2019m really glad I read this book. It was a quick read and one I didn\u2019t want to put down. I\u2019m looking forward to the next book in the series and hopefully finding out more about Nikki\u2019s sister.

Nikki and Tyler make an adorable couple and I am so glad that they are pursuing a relationship together. I have liked her determination to continue investigating her sister\u2019s disappearance for over ten years. I hope more is revealed in the next book, Vanishing Point, about this ongoing mystery. This fourth book in the series is due to be released in November 2017 and I can\u2019t wait!"}, {"userName": "V.

Don't bother trying to guess. Just allow yourself to be swept up in this thrilling ride!I do just want to note that there are some hard deaths in this story. Nothing extremely graphic, but that doesn't make it any less difficult.The story starts with an airplane crash that makes me seriously reconsider ever flying again! Once Nikki is pulled into the missing person case for her fellow passenger, her life is put on the line again and again. This case is personal is so many ways. Even though Nikki is a seasoned agent, she's a human being, so seeing her struggle with her near death and the hard-hitting angles of the case proved to be realistic. In the midst of Nikki's desperate search, she learns to let go of the plans she has for the future with Tyler...and trust God. In case I've worried anyone, Nikki and Tyler sitting in a tree... ; ) Four Stars! Action packed!! This might be my favorite book in the series. If you like a suspenseful story with a little romance, then you must read this story. Each story is its own separate mystery, however, since there are elements in the backstory and romance that build in each book, I recommend reading Vendetta and Missing first. To my knowledge, this is the last novel in The Nikki Boyd Files. HOWEVER, Vanishing Point: A Nikki Boyd Novel, releases November 7th, 2017. The story is told from a different perspective. Also, rumor has it that we will finally learn what happened to Nikki's sister, Sarah.I. Can't. Wait.I received a copy of Pursued by Lisa Harris from Revell, a division of Baker Publishing Group.

I was not disappointed! Despite the fact that it was the third in the series (what is with that? This is now the third book in a row that I\u2019ve read that was the third in a series. I guess they do say \u2018three\u2019s a charm\u2019 but seriously! Okay anyway\u2026), it worked pretty good as a stand-alone. I could tell that there were things in the previous books that were referenced, but it never felt like it was hard to follow or anything. I do want to go back and read those though.This is one of those fast paced books whose chapter titles are marked by hours and minutes on the clock, and the whole thing takes place within the space of about 60 hours. Definitely made it difficult to put down. There were some unexpected (even disappointing) twists, and I actually don\u2019t feel like there was complete resolution to the main issue, but not sure if that might be something the author continues in her next book. I can\u2019t go into details without giving serious spoilers. I did enjoy the spiritual side as well. While it wasn\u2019t as strong as others I\u2019ve read, she still brought out some great truths, especially toward the end. Mrs. Harris is a very talented author and I look forward to reading the next book in the series as well as others she\u2019s written as I get the opportunity. Overall, I would give this a four star rating!Disclaimer: I received this book from Revell Books in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5721050-amy", "userReview": "I have been looking forward to Pursued since I read its excerpt last year at the end of Missing. This story was an adrenaline rush. Starting with the crashed airplane that Nikki was on; her day goes from pretty bad to worst. And then some more bad happens, a lot. I actually felt really bad for her and if it were me I would have went off with new hunky boyfriend/ best friend Tyler for the rest of the day. But no, Nikki becomes a key witness and the best possible hope in a missing person\u2019s case of the woman who was sitting right next to her on the plane.This was jam packed with excitement, danger, and Nikki\u2019s emotions are all over the place. Not only is she dealing with this new missing person case, but she has also received some devastating personal news. This was a very quick read; my only complaint is I was really hoping for more of Nikki and Tyler time. I am hoping that they get their own story, together. I am looking forward to the next in the Nikki Boyd Files where the synopsis tells us that we will finally get the answer we have been waiting for this entire series, the reason Nikki Boyd is who she is: what happened to her missing sister. I received a copy of this book for free from the publisher. I was not required to post a positive review and the views and opinions expressed are my own.

It was not obvious by the way the book ended if the series is over or not. This book had far more mystery, suspense, and action than the previous two books. I actually feared the book was going to be slow and boring, and how wrong I was. It took a while for the action and suspense to start, but the book really took off when it did start. I found myself reading as fast as I could to see what would happen next. Bodies were piling up, and I was wondering if anyone was going to be left alive by the end of the book, but there were some. The romantic parts of a book like this aren't always of interest to me, it depends on how the author approaches it. I found myself hoping the one in this series would work out, and it came to a satisfying end. This book does tend to be more violent than the others, but I still enjoyed it a lot. I made the mistake of starting it on my work lunch break, and had to wait til I got home to finish it. And finish it I did. The author outdid herself on this one, and if this is the end of the series, it is a great one. I was given a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "ASC Book Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14593382-asc-book-reviews", "userReview": "There are things I LOVE about the Nikki Boyd books and then there are things that I don't so much. And Pursued is no exception. :) Let me start with the LOVE! Lisa added so much prayer from Nikki in Pursued and I LOVED IT!!!! With suspenseful scene after scene I LOVED how Nikki would send up quick prayers along the way! I actually really love Nikki as a character also, she's unique and interesting! There were somethings that I thought didn't add up as far as facts and the timeline however and there were sometimes I found myself thinking, \"wait that's doesn't make sense\" or \"come on guys [talking to the characters, you know you do it to ;) ] you know what's going on. Stop asking silly questions.\". There were also some sense that were a tad too long for me; I found my mind wandering. BUT Nikki's personal mystery, you know the one that got her into law enforcement, about her sister's case are the parts that keep me going, even through the too long scenes! I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOOK where, I'm hoping, we finally find out all about Sarah!!! Overall I think followers of this series will enjoy this one, but I don't think this is a stand alone.Songs: \"Oh My Soul\" by Casting CrownsSongs etc. May be changed and/or added in the future. ~ASC2 Corinthians 12:9-10~ASC*I requested and received this book from Revell for the purpose of reviewing it.

She is an agent with the missing persons division of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. While this book reads well on its own, I suggest reading the earlier books in the series to understand Nikki's passion for finding missing persons.This novel has a good combination of action and investigative techniques. Nikki is a capable investigator but she is plagued with disrupting thoughts. I did get a bit tired of Nikki thinking of something in the past, then someone saying something jerking her back to the present. Nikki is not quite the effective policewoman I am used to having in novels with female leads. Readers who like extended accounts of character thoughts that interrupt the flow of the action will like this novel. Interestingly enough, when Nikki does come out of her thoughts, she rises to the occasion as a good and forceful agent.This is a good investigative procedural novel. There is also a bit of romance. There is a little Christian influence but it is not strong. I recommend it to readers who do enjoy suspense with a good dose of troubled character thinking as well.I received a complimentary egalley of this book from the publisher. My comments are an independent and honest review."}, {"userName": "Fiction Aficionado", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39426033-fiction-aficionado", "userReview": "If you love a good law enforcement suspense read, look no further. This book is action from the first chapter to the last\u2014the kind of action that has the good guys on the back foot from the get-go, scrambling to find the person they\u2019re supposed to be protecting, let alone trying to get to the bottom of what\u2019s really going on.Nikki\u2019s arrival in Nashville also coincides with Tyler\u2019s return from a three month posting in Liberia, and she\u2019s anticipating their reunion as the plane comes in to land, but her personal life takes a backseat before she\u2019s even left the airport. Those who prefer an emphasis on the romantic part of romantic suspense may feel a little disappointed that Nikki and Tyler\u2019s relationship didn\u2019t take a more central role throughout the story, but it honestly didn\u2019t need to in this one. That said, the knowledge that Nikki has some serious news that she is yet to share with Tyler does hover in her mind throughout the story, and the fact that this is weighing on Nikki adds to the urgency and tension in several of the scenes, as well as Nikki\u2019s emotional involvement in the case.Readers who are eagerly awaiting the answers to what happened to Nikki\u2019s sister will pick up one or two more pieces of information here, but the conclusion to this plot will come in the next book in the series, Vanishing Point, releasing in November 2017. Personally, I can\u2019t wait! In the meantime, this was a gripping read, highly recommended for readers of romantic suspense.I received a copy of this novel from the publisher.
