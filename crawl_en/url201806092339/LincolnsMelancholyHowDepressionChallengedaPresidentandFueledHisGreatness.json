First, this book is engagingly written, and Joshua Wolf Shenk has done his research. In spite of this, I don't think it's a good first book for anyone to read on Lincoln, because much of Shenk's focus is on revisionist history. Although he does a laudable job providing brief overviews of some of the historiography on Lincoln, many readers will get more from this if they have a more detailed understanding of major events in Lincoln's life. Second, as a medieval historian who gravitates to social and cultural history, I have profound concerns about psychological interpretations of the past. As a graduate student, I was influenced by Thomas S. Kuhn's study of the role of paradigms in science, and as someone who teaches history of sexuality I can point to many examples of how medical professionals, psychiatrists, psychologists, psychoanalysts, and scientists have constructed understandings of normality versus abnormality via frameworks that stem from the societies in which these scientists were trained and lived. I'm not suggesting that there is no physical or biological \"truth\" independent of culture; however, I am arguing that cultural norms play an influential role in how people construct paradigms to explain the world around them, and that these paradigms are not restricted to myths and legends, but extend to other areas of life, including not only religion but also science. I have particular concerns about applications of Freudian theory to other societies -- for example, Erik Erikson's Young Man Luther: A Study in Psychoanalysis and History, in which Erikson applies psychoanalytic theory to understanding Martin Luther's life, made me alternatively laugh and grind my teeth. Because of these concerns, I was happy to read Shenk's very clear statements in Lincoln's Melancholy: How Depression Challenged a President and Fueled his Greatness that he was not interested in applying modern views of depression and mental health wholesale to his analysis of Lincoln's sadness. I agree with the importance of his project, to expand studies of Lincoln into a his ideas, thoughts, emotions, contextualizing all these elements in Lincoln's culture. The three stars I have given to this book show that, in my opinion, Shenk achieved this goal in part, but not completely. Abraham LincolnShenk divides the book into three sections. In the first, he explores Lincoln's childhood, family background, and young adulthood, while also providing a basic framework to understand how his life exemplifies certain aspects of depression. In this discussion, he moves back and forth between modern definitions, and contemporary understandings of melancholy and hypochondriasis, delving both into literature on the history of medicine and primary sources written by Lincoln and his friends and associates. Shenk also revisits historiographic controversy over Lincoln's relationship with Ann Rutledge, whose death occurred at the time of Lincoln's first major breakdown in 1835. Shenk carefully sifts through existing sources, and provides a cautious revisionist interpretation of what Rutledge may have meant to Lincoln. Shenk concludes this section with a lengthy discussion of events in Lincoln's life leading up to his second major breakdown in 1840-1841. Once again, Shenk questions some historians' assumption that a temporary parting with Mary Todd led to the breakdown, instead discussing the vague nature of evidence, recreating timelines, and expanding his consideration of stresses in Lincoln's life beyond the romantic to Lincoln's political career. He spends much time discussing Lincoln's close friendship with Joshua Speed, drawing some parallels between their experiences and using Speed as a source on Lincoln's life in this period. Throughout this section, Shenk argues that Lincoln's emotions fit patterns for melancholy in his time, and, to some extent, depression in our time. I found particularly interesting Shenk's discussion of treatments of hypochondriasis and melancholy in Lincoln's time, and wish he had continued to focus on this context through, rather than relying as much as he did on ore current thinking about depression. Ann Rutledge and Abraham Lincoln -- truth or myth?In the second section of the book, Shenk shifts his focus to Lincoln's determination in the face of his melancholy. He bore certain pressures as a self-made man, a new role that put Lincoln particularly at risk to be intensely self-critical and pessimistic, as he bore the responsibility for his achievements. Shenk also explores some of the intellectual currents of Lincoln's time that fueled his intense self-examination. Throughout this discussion, Shenk provides some context to understand Lincoln's fatalism and sense of destiny, not only through cultural context, but also through an analysis of Lincoln's writings. Mary Todd LincolnShenk's approach to understanding the persistence of Lincoln's melancholy after he was married shows a renewed reliance on modern understandings of depression: \"From the perspective of modern clinicians, the persistence and quality of Lincoln's symptoms call for a new diagnostic framework. Major depressive disorder, which applies to Lincoln's earlier years, best describes a series of discrete episodes, even if they go on for many months at a time. But when a condition lasts for more than two years, even with some breaks in symptoms, it is considered to be a chronic depression. Episodic and chronic depressions have much in common, but the distinction matters. Imagine a person who begins to travel abroad as a tourist. The first few trips are memorable\u2014when they started, how long they lasted. But if the trips grow in frequency and duration, at some point the tourist would become known as an expatriate. The destination need not have changed, but the nature of the journey would call for a qualitative, not just a quantitative, distinction.\"As it turns out, the \"land\" of chronic depression is one for which few guidebooks have been written. The psychologist James P. McCullough, Jr., one authority on the condition, describes it as \"grossly misdiagnosed, understudied, and undertreated.\" This poses both a challenge and an opportunity in the study of Lincoln. The existing literature can't definitively contextualize his experience. But his life, supplemented with the shards of knowledge on chronic depression, can offer a new and valuable context. In particular, it shows how depression, for good and for ill, can blend slowly, subtly, but surely with a person as he works to bring himself into balance.\"I think that Shenk's approach, looking to Lincoln's life to lend perspective to depression, and looking to research on depression to understand Lincoln's life, leads him to rely too much on this modern perspective and research, especially in the second and third parts of the biography. He did not have to take this approach -- in places, he discusses the 19th-century view that melancholy led not only to suffering, but also to gifts for the sufferer. And this argument constitutes Shenk's main thesis, which he explores in detail throughout his third section -- that Lincoln responded to his melancholy and breakdowns by deciding, at a certain point, that he had to continue on to fulfill a destiny much greater than he was, one that grew over time to be tied to the realization of the Founders' view for this country as a place of freedom. Lincoln recognized the gaps between this ideal and the reality of the Founders' views as implemented, but he viewed American history as unfolding and leading towards progress. According to Shenk, over time Lincoln saw the abolition of slavery as a means to help achieve this goal. In addition, Lincoln's fatalism provided him with strengths during his Presidency, as he did not tend to be over optimistic in his assessment of the Union's progress in the Civil War.As a whole, I did like this book. It's thoughtful, well-researched, and engaging. Shenk also provides some useful statements about the dangers of relying on modern definitions of depression to understand Lincoln. His analysis of Lincoln's breakdowns after Ann Rutledge died in 1835 and in 1840-1841 provide some excellent examples of historical analysis of vague primary sources. And many of Shenk's analysis of Lincoln are engaging, as in his chapter exploring Lincoln's coping strategies, including humor. In the end, though, I found Shenk to be overly-reliant on these models and research. I wish he had devoted some more time to expanding on some of the fascinating contextual information he provides, as I think he's at his best when focusing on Lincoln's time period. I also wish he had been more consistent in his analysis in differentiating between contemporary reflections on Lincoln (in letters and writings from the time), and retrospective reflections by Lincoln's associates and friends. As a whole, though, this is a biography that provides a different emphasis to undertand Lincoln, as well as some new topics and themes to explore in studying the emotional and intellectual world of Lincoln and his contemporaries."}, {"userName": "Pouting Always", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-pouting-always", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book and getting to know more about Lincoln because I never knew how humorous and kind he was. It's hard when learning history in school to see people who lived before you as being human too and I really enjoy these biographies for humanizing people for me. I think the author did a good job in presenting the different opinions people had on events in Lincoln's life we aren't completely sure about. I really adore Lincoln now and I really enjoyed that anecdote about him being president during the civil war and reading the satire about himself. The only thing is that towards the end the book started to feel redundant because the author's overall theme for the book was talking about Lincoln through the lens of his supposed depression and it just was a flat ending but again ending books is harder so."}, {"userName": "Darwin8u", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u", "userReview": "\"Don't you find\", he said, \"judging from his picture, that his eyes are full of tears and that his lips are sad with a secret sorrow?\"- A young Circassian rider to Leo Tolstoy, when presented with a photograph of Abraham Lincoln (originally told by Leo Tolstoy toe the New York World shortly before Tolstoy died\"Man is born broken. He lives by mending. The grace of God is glue!\"- Eugene O'NeillAbraham Lincoln has reached one of those levels of recognition and reverence that is typically reserved for saints and prophets. His character, linked to his words and his dramatic life and death, all contribute to a continued and massive interest. A Wall Street Journal article on the Lincoln publishing industry noted:16,000: Number of books publishers estimate have been written about Abraham Lincoln.5,796: Number of Lincoln biographies249: Number of biographies on Lincoln published in 2009, the bicentennial of his birth42: Number of books Harold Holzer, a Lincoln historian, has written, edited, or co-edited on the 16th president2,972: Number of biographies of George WashingtonThe Ford's Theatre for Education and Leadership in Washington built a three-story tower of Lincoln books.I understand the attraction a bit more than most. I own several dozen Lincoln books and biographies, I am six feet six inches tall, walk with an awkward gate, and also suffer from a disease that Abe Lincoln is thought by many to have had (Marfan Syndrome, see page 22 of this book). I share many physical proximities and many intellectual affinities with Lincoln (a love of politics, poetry, humanism, individualism, justice, and an affection for the Godly and a skepticism of the dogma of those who profess to speak for God). Anyway, I have been curious about this book for years.'Lincoln's Melancholy' attempts to: (1) investigate how \"Lincoln's melancholy manifested itself in his early life and young manhood and how it fits--and challenges--the diagnostic categories of modern psychiatry\", (2) show \"what Lincoln did in response to his melancholy, the strategies he used to heal and help himself\", and (3) address \"how Lincoln's melancholy became intertwined with his mature character, ideas, and actions\". It is a three act play, a hero's journey complete with crisis, struggle, and resolution/spiritual awakening. Shenk doesn't sketch a perfect picture. There are many gaps and contradictions and mysteries that will always surround a true inquiry into the inner Lincoln. I think, however, the author was humble enough to understand the limits of his efforts. The book was short enough to not waste time and interesting enough to keep me reading. I think his theory of Lincoln's melancholy is fascinating. It further complicates the story of a complicated, beautiful, and sad man who just may have ended up by fortune and misfortune being one of the greatest of all men."}, {"userName": "Eric_W", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1711431-eric-w", "userReview": "I just don't know what to make of this book. It's interesting and filled with all sorts of delectable detail, but as far as the major premise goes, I remain skeptical. The author's assumption is that because melancholy and depression change your focus on how you see the world and because Lincoln suffered from what seems to be perpetual gloom, that this enabled him to become the great man he became, moving through stages of fear and on to insight and creativity. Well, maybe.I have to admit that my crap detector went into overdrive on several occasions while reading this book.Frankly, given the multiple tragedies in Lincoln's life he had every reason to be gloomy. Death was an ever present reality. (More on the barbaric medical practices of the time later.) Secondly, the 19th century seems to wallow in gloom. Just read some of Hawthorne, Poe, and others of the early 19th and you'll feel gloomy by osmosis.Now for some of the really juicier and fun parts of this book. I laughed out loud at the passages on studies on depression and the realization that \"happiness\" is really a mental disorder: \"Abramson and Alloy termed the benefit that depressed people showed in the experiment the \"Depressive Realism\" or the \"Sadder but Wiser\" effect. . . For example, one standard definition of mental health is the ability to maintain close and accurate contact with reality. . .But research shows that by this definition, happiness itself should be considered a mental disorder.\" (Priceless) \"In fact,'much research suggests that when they are not depressed, people are highly vulnerable to illusions, including unrealistic optimism, overestimation of themselves, and an exaggerated sense of their capacity to control events.\" The lesson? Get Gloomy, folks. Happiness psychologist Richard Bentall suggested (only half-facetiously) should be classified as a psychiatric disorder: \"major affective disorder (pleasant type.)\"Lincoln's \"hypochondriasis\" as it was known was treated in his day according to Dr. Benjamin Rush's Medical Inquiries and Observations upon the Diseases of the Mind, the stand text. This included \"drastic interferences\" with the body. Starting by bleeding (usually 12.5 pints in two months - we are really talking about a total flush here), then \"blistering\" by applying \"small heated cups at the temples, behind the ears, and at the nape of the neck.\" Of course, leeches could also be used. Next, drugs were given to induce vomiting and diarrhea, all the while, requiring that the patients fast, Rush noting that elephant tamers make their charges more docile by starving them. Following this regimen was a diet of stimulants including quinine and black pepper in large doses. Mercury was used to purge the stomach (also arsenic and strychnine. Of course, mercury also causes depression, anxiety and irritability.) Green stools were a positive sign, indicating the \"black bile\" cause of the illness was leaving. Apparently the more the patient suffered the better as it was evidence the body was being cleaned out. Whether Lincoln underwent all of these treatments is unclear, although we know that Dr. Henry, his physician was an advocate of Rush's treatments.Shenck appears to approve of Nietzsche's (and probably Frankel would approve, too) remark \"That which does not kill me makes me stronger.\" Well, maybe.Occasionally, I felt that the author might have done better to write a long journal article to make his point. Long digressions on the Missouri Compromise and other historical niceties while fascinating (and they were, I really enjoyed his lucid presentations of all sorts of historical facts) seemed unnecessary to his thesis. BUT, I really did enjoy the read and would recommend it."}, {"userName": "Danya", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1766739-danya", "userReview": "If you suffer from a mood disorder you will find great solice here.

Bottom line: this is a book that is carefully researched; rarely overreaches; and makes a compelling case that Lincoln's life was punctuated by a depression so severe and defining that we might as well call it a relapsing and incurable illness. I appreciate Shenk's absolute refusal to color inside the lines of contemporary psychology or psychiatry; an underlying point here (barely disguised) is that while depression is real and deadly, Lincoln muddled through largely because he lived in a world where men could be vulnerable without necessarily exposing themselves to career-ending suspicions. And because he had the presence of mind to see that there were far more important things at hand besides feeling better immediately. Wasn't at all the same for women, of course; Shenk plays fair with the abysmal treatment of Mary Lincoln, who he refuses to call \"Mary Todd\" for the simple reason that her contemporaries never called her that. Closest thing possible to giving a voice to someone that is and was essentially voiceless. But to the broader point on Lincoln's own ability to harness the doldrums and hell of \"melancholy,\" Shenk is pretty clear that our contemporary paradigm for thinking about depression is about as imperfect as 1850s-era America -- and perhaps a fair bit worse. I'm interested enough in this subject matter that I'm probably overlooking some stylistic decisions and omissions I'd like to learn more about from other Lincoln biographers. Whatever. One final point: Shenk's work is needed at this moment precisely because well-meaning (knock on wood) professionals have taken it upon themselves to diagnose the current Oval Office occupant from afar; see Bandy X. Lee, \"The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump,\" and the \"Duty to Warn\" conference at Yale. Popular interest in Trump's mental state dodges the question of his dangerous politics; perpetuates the myth that mental illness makes one inherently unable to serve in elected office; and applies to Trump exactly the same \"sensibilities\" that would preclude a more transcendent and inspiring \"mentally-ill\" candidate from seeking office. The solution to Donald Trump isn't to diagnose him. It's to impeach him if possible; to reconfigure institutions of presidential selection to ensure similar candidates are not selected in the future; and any number of other things. Maybe the solution is to elect another Lincoln even - who I'm now absolutely convinced had the presence of mind, precisely because he was so somber, to have called the present bullshit exactly what it is."}, {"userName": "Gloria", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2124093-gloria", "userReview": "I felt like I'd read ALL about Abraham Lincoln, especially when it came to his years in office as President.After finishing this book, I feel like I now know LESS about him than I did before.Shenk has done a remarkable and thorough job poring over vast collections of papers, letters, correspondence and previously published works in regard to a Lincoln we rarely see:-The young Lincoln (passionate, somewhat volatile, and full of wicked wit and humor, but equally prone to \"dark moods\").-The resigned Lincoln (who, in his mid to late 20's-- after suffering through a myriad of personal griefs and tragedies-- went through what could be called his first bout of serious depression).In addition, this served as a great explanation in the contrast between how society and medicine (now vs. then) perceived melancholy/depression.There's far too much here to sum up succinctly and well in a review, so I can only encourage those who are either interested in more on Lincoln's personal character or interested in the realm of depression as a whole to please read this incredibly well-written and documented book.As far as how Lincoln's melancholy fueled his greatness, one paragraph stood out to me as a prime explanation:When a depressed person does get out of bed, it's usually not with a sudden insight that life is rich and valuable, but out of some creeping sense of duty or instinct for survival. If collapsing is sometimes vital, so is the brute force of will. To William James we owe the insight that, in the absence of real health, we sometimes must act as if we are healthy. Buoyed by such discipline and habit, we might achieve actual well-being. As Lincoln advised a grumbling general who felt humiliated at having only three thousand men under his command, \"'Act well your part, there all the honor lies.' He who does something at the head of one Regiment, will eclipse him who does nothing at the head of a hundred.\""}, {"userName": "Sherri Person", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1802952-sherri-person", "userReview": "Okay, where should I begin with this book? Yikes, and yowzers--I'm simply mad about Lincoln, like stalker kind of mad. After reading this book, had Lincoln been alive, he would most definitely have to hide from me, because I just fell in love with him even more. Keep in mind I read this about three years ago, so I'm a bit rusty with details, but what I remember most about this great read is the display of Lincoln's character. WolfShenk wrote about Lincoln being a common man, and he was. Lincoln was a man who utterly despised the ill treatment of slaves, and loathed the existence of slavery. He was a man who dared to go against the majority, expose crimes against our fellow human beings, and suffer ridicule and persecution from the public so that he could earnestly strive toward a better future for America. What I love most about Lincoln is that he was self-aware. Lincoln was not afraid to admit his love for YHWH, and after his admittance, was quite quick to tell anyone interested, that he didn't feel it necessary to attend church all the time, if even at all. Lincoln was also deeply aware that he was a flawed man and relied heavily on his faith to keep him from stumbling. Lincoln cried openly in public forums, agonized over tough political decisions, and wasn't ashamed to walk among the common men and women of America. Overall, I recommend this book to lovers of Lincoln, and I even recommend it to those that don't really know anything about the man. I think this book is the best representation of Lincoln as the man he was, and the legacy he left America, then any other work on Lincoln I have ever read."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1020305-john", "userReview": "I will note at the beginning that I am very glad that someone has written a book that treats this subject as thoroughly as Shenk has treated it. It seems likely that Shenk has established depression as an element of Lincoln's biography that the industry can no longer ignore. I think also that the subject can be treated much more effectively than Shenk has managed.Allow me to offer two personal disclosures (pd's) at this point. First, I have not ventured into the domain of Lincoln biography apart from a handful of titles that have been awarded Pulitzers or Lincoln awards. My reason is quite simply that I don't find politicians particularly interesting human beings, for the most part, remarkable only for their vapidity, and I don't care to spend much time in their company. Exceptions obvious to anyone who follows my reviews: Stalin, Hitler, Lyndon Johnson and George Wallace. I can give no reasons for these exceptions. Second, my perspective on Shenk's material derives from long (decades long) personal experience of \"severe, recurring major depression (without psychotic features),\" followed by much less virulent forms, which now, after sixty years of depressive episodes, at my advanced age, rather annoy from time to time but do no harm. I am not a clinician. I will say, however, that I found the subject rather compelling at one point in my life. But no longer.I have often compared acute depressive episodes to bouts of one stomach virus or another. Obviously the duration is shorter. Nonetheless, both diseases are overwhelming, and one is utterly powerless to prevent or delay their onset. They come and they go, and then one feels crappy, groggy, weakened. Then what? In my case, I was married, had two wonderful little daughters, who are still wonderful, by the way, a house, a mortgage, car loans - the \"whole catastrophe,\" as Zorba would say. I had to recover under a burden of fatigue and numb indifference (and no despair, whatever), the like of which I have never experienced at any other time. But I did - doing the next thing on the list, knowing full well that it mattered not one whit, whether I wanted to or not. Imagine shopping for groceries with a seemingly endless list in hand - for months. My sense is that Shenk doesn't really understand the course of major depression, especially severe, recurring major depression. (I wish I could recall the DSM identifier). He describes stages in Lincoln's experience of depression over his life, but he does not convey the insight that depression of each type, whether major or \"chronic\" (whatever that may mean) - in each stage of life - also involves a disease course, a cycle with a beginning, middle and end. For example, he describes certain episodes of acute depression during the first \"stage\" of Lincoln's experience of the disease in early adulthood, and I have no doubt whatever that these episodes actually occurred exactly as Shenk has described them. But I also suspect that his descriptions are incomplete. Certainly his narratives include accounts of the precursors and most excruciatingly painful - and dramatic - hours or days of these episodes. What he doesn't describe - and seems not to understand - is that these days and hours are but segments of a cycle that can consume months. He focuses on the beginning and middle - and leaves out the end altogether, i.e. the recovery from these early episodes. And it's exactly this phase of recovery, which can take months and months, that is quite frankly the most difficult - for me at least. I presume, although Shenk doesn't tell us, that Lincoln had to earn a living throughout. He had to put one foot in front of the other, one day at a time, every day without ever knowing when exactly the \"hangover\" - as I call it - would end. So what did Lincoln actually do during the leaden months of recovery? How did he cope? That's what I want to know. I also wish that Shenk had developed a coherent clinical perspective/understanding on the disease and inserted that perspective into his book as sub-text, using it to form his account. Pick one, any one. His quotes from one psychologist or psychiatrist or another every few pages didn't establish credentials or credibility - in my mind at least. He quotes William James and Victor Frankl more frequently than other \"authorities,\" without establishing why exactly it is that I should consider this hodgepodge of texts 60 to 100 years old authoritative, quite as if their authority is self-evident and for all time. I would much rather have read a clinically comprehensive, complete account of Lincoln's experience of depression - and intervals between episodes, if he ever experienced relief - that is informed by a medical perspective that Shenk found convincing. He might well have explained it all in footnotes or in a technical appendix - all of which I would have read eagerly. I've recorded similar comments in Capper's biography of Margaret Fuller.I won't carry on much further, but I really can't resist commenting upon Shenk's explicit comparisons of Lincoln with Jesus, Buddha, St. Francis of Assisi. Perhaps such comparisons are entirely merited. I can't say. I can only remark that I read this book to learn of Lincoln's experience of depression. Expressions of worshipful adoration - even during the Christmas season - do not advance my understanding of the man and his experience, and I do believe - still - that Lincoln was fully human. [Another pd. I was raised in the Southern Presbyterian Church - so we held very low opinions of idols, graven images, popes, priests, Billy Graham, and other assorted self-appointed and extraordinarily wealthy messiahs and intermediaries - unless, of course, one were concerned with certain passages in the Westminster Confession of Faith (1643, of course - and no other edition) regarding the \"sainthood of all believers.\" I've not yet recovered from that experience.]The content of this rant, notwithstanding, I am grateful to Shenk for giving us this book.

I was about eleven. It was unnerving, but even growing up steeped in Civil War history, it was the first time I realized how much Lincoln meant, on a personal level, to people. I was drawn to this book because I come from a family of depressives. Those who aren't on medication are self-medicating drunks. (A couple of them are both.) Somehow, some of us have managed to pull ourselves together and get on with the business of life. I often wonder if we would accomplish more (or less) if we lived in a different time, or if we were happier people, or if we weren't medicated. One of my parents stopped taking medication and said, \"I can't think clearly on this. It makes me stupid.\" (It was an odd thing to say to me; I had just finished law school...on anti-depressants.) In a nutshell, this is a survey of Lincoln's life and his depression (or melancholy), and how it worked to his detriment and to his advantage in public and private life. It is intriguing. I was fascinated by the completely different view of melancholic temperament vs. depression now. It was something of an asset 150 years ago; it's still shameful today. Can you even imagine electing a man president who'd once been put on a suicide watch? The book kept me turning pages quickly. At first, it was because I was enraptured. Then...it was because I just wanted it to be over. Because the thing is, the book is about 50 pages of great history and 150 pages of filler. And the filler...the author explains de Toqueville is French and what Democracy in America is about; the author explains the book of Job, after Lincoln is seen reading Job; the author explains Henry Ward Beecher was the Billy Graham of his day; the author explains the Kansas-Nebraska Act in excruciating detail; the author explains popular remedies for depression based on purchases Lincoln made at a pharmacy, even though there's no evidence whom the medications were for.And so on. And on. For all that, there was scant attention paid to Lincoln's marriage, which you'd think would be fairly critical to his mental state.Great notes, though.

Lincoln broke with theologians of the time who believed melancholy/depression was a sin. Lincoln knew it was far more than that.

I learned a great deal about Lincoln. I learned a great deal about myself. I knew, from previous biographies that I've read about Lincoln, that he had a 'melancholy disposition', but never realized until this book that it was full on depression. At one point he was put on suicide watch by his friends. Shenk explains how earlier accounts of Lincoln purposely ignored this aspect of Lincoln, primarily because it was not 'in vogue' to discuss mental illness. Lincoln overcame his illness by his desire to do something meaningful with his life. He also found coping mechanisms through humor and reading. I found it interesting (and profoundly sad) that he finally felt he had accomplished his life's mission (emancipation, 14th amendment) and for the first time in his life was truly happy, then, of course, was assassinated. One of the more interesting discussions was about Lincoln's religious life. He was a deeply faithful, god-fearing person, yet also full of questions, which prevented him from embracing traditional Christianity. I enjoyed seeing his humanity."}, {"userName": "Carter", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/330467-carter", "userReview": "This book succeeds very well at applying modern sensibilities toward mental illness to an otherwise well-covered topic. It's at its best when it compares the ways Lincoln's peers viewed his melancholia vs. the ways we tend to view depression today. I was floored to learn that people in the 19th century, before the Industrial Revolution turned non-stop back-breaking labor into a national virtue, were actually *more* accepting of depressive traits than we are now. In fact, Lincoln's contemporaries discussed his mental illness far more openly, and far less judgmentally, than we possibly could approach a president's emotional problems today."}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/283984-jen", "userReview": "I recommended this book to my therapist.

The research and scholarship is excellent. He included many references from many disciplines and that added great value to the author's credibility and thoughtfulness of the topic. He was very realistic about how history can be so tainted by the teller and that was refreshing and enlightening.

I think it's changed my life. To see that someone as great as Abraham Lincoln suffered through depression is encouraging. I also wonder what hope there is for the rest of us. Does greatness always entail this kind of pain? I think Shenk does a good job of presenting letters from Lincoln and friends to support his claims: that Lincoln was a depressive and that his depression helped to make him the great President that he became. Shenk's book is not a biography however. If you are looking for a start-to-finish account of Lincoln's life, start with a more traditional biography. This book centers on a theme, melancholy, and follows it throughout Lincoln's life. Shenk relies in spots on McPherson's \"Battle Cry of Freedom\" to supply the historical context, particularly during Lincoln's presidency. I'm really grateful that there are scholars willing to compile historical documents to create what I hope is a more complete image of a mythological feature such as Lincoln. I do think Shenk could have left some of Lincoln's faults to stand on their own, such as Lincoln's early and mid-life racial humor. I think in Shenk's admiration he tends to defend or justify Lincoln's fault in one way or another, or painting them as a necessary part in the path to greatness at other times when it would have been fine to let Lincoln stand as a flawed figure in more ways than just melancholy alone would suggest. Great book though - well researched I think (Shenk has his own quirky footnote style - no numbers, it's hard to follow what came from where). But yeah, great book.

Written in 2005. I like the style of writing, somewhere between historical, psychological and personal opinion. Readable style.About halfway through (not a long book). Not impressed with Mr. Lincoln, sadly. We would all do well to learn about the folks we think of as heroes. Basically, it's not because of the melancholy, but his godless world view, though he refers to God often. His view of God is not personal. The author weaves faith and intellect and melancholy giving a holistic view. Informing the reader of the culture of Lincoln's day is helpful too, including changes in word definition and connotation.Finished with the Epilogue, reading the Endnotes now, can't get enough.. I really like the way this author writes. He has a wealth of knowledge of the subject, but he doesn't come across in an authoritarian manner. He presents the information for the reader to ponder and digest. It is as if he has given a gift to his readers, the gift of his own insight into the man Lincoln. Most writing about Lincoln idolizes the man, and focuses on misleading information often taken out of context. This writer is able to present the facts in a thoughtful manner which invokes the reader's mind, as good writing should.Well worth reading the Afterword for the author's assessment of biographies and original works by and about Lincoln. Interesting how a well-written and well-read subject evolves over time, depending upon the opinions of the researchers and writers.Highly recommend this book to all lovers of people and history and these United States of America.

It becomes clear while reading \"Melancholy\", that Lincoln's personal suffering, including his own battle with depression and suicidal ideation, the loss of three out of his four sons (two sons died while Lincoln was in office), and his tumultuous marriage to Mary Todd, are sufferings that led him to a profound understanding of the unspeakable tragedy of war, and how this understanding enabled Lincoln to persevere and triumph in the face of America's most devastating crises."}, {"userName": "Sahaj", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30484141-sahaj", "userReview": "\"For not giving you a general summary of news, you must pardon me; it is not in my power to do so.

To remain as I am is impossible; I must die or be better, it appears to me.\" - Abe Lincoln, Jany. 23rd. 1841- Springfield, Ills.Most of us, someday, have felt, feel, or will feel the same way.A book ago I realized that I have a habit of underlining text as I read, thankfully, though, with a pencil. I mostly read while I am travelling on Indian roads(!) so the lines are never straight but squiggly. Sometimes it'd start from an underline and end up being a strikethrough! I wanted this to be minimal, I mean with least marks. It turned out I picked a wrong book to do that.Book: Look at the photo above. Don't you see sadness drooling from his face? The book is about that sadness. Looking at him through the lens of his melancholy, and learning about melancholy in light of Lincoln's experience. The book can be put into several shelves, actually. You may put it in historiography, biography, psychology, and even self-help! It is a fresh perspective of Lincoln, which had been thrown away reflecting the clich\u00e9: throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Melancholy here, being the baby. Bath water is his alleged affair with some Anna Rutledge, death of whom was an assumed cause of Lincoln's first breakdown.\nFirst part:\nHere, the author traces roots of Lincoln's sadness. They being entrenched in his family, with circumstances casting their effects. The author paints a nice picture of L\u2019s familial background which caused a biological predisposition towards depression.Description of Abraham\u2019s inclination towards seclusion \u2013 he noted in his memoir that he \u201cstudied with nobody\u201d \u2013 his sympathy, even towards animals, and of course, his wit and wisdom follows. Next, the author portrays how untimely death of Anna Mayes Rutledge \u2013 a bright, pretty, young woman \u2013 with whom Lincoln had befriended, caused him to be suicidal. \u201cThat was the time the community said he was crazy,\u201d remembered Elizabeth Abell.After placing Lincoln on the scope of suicide, author neatly justifies Lincoln\u2019s state by using collective inputs from field experts ranging from Charles Bukowski to Dr. Kay Jamison. This is succeeded by a brief description of clinical and major depression.An anecdote in which Lincoln had caught two birds in his hand to put them back in their nest gives an affirmation to L\u2019s sympathy towards animals. \u201cI could not have slept tonight if I had not given those two little birds to their mother\u201d :L.A poem titled The Suicide\u2019s Soliloquy brought some overwhelming emotions, although no one is sure who wrote that poem but suspects Lincoln might have.The passage you read at the beginning is from Abraham\u2019s letter to John Stuart, his then law partner, in which he was trying to pass on the news about Stuart\u2019s reelection. It succinctly gives an idea about the state of mind Lincoln was in at the time.\nSecond part:\nThe second part is about how one of the great leaders on the earth made lemonade from the lemons he had got. Lincoln was aware of the labors that lied ahead, all of them: intellectual, material, philosophical and emotional. This was the time of 19th century when the science of self-help was on the horizon. The author succeeded in getting a piece of such an article from Illinois State Journal.Perseverance and forbearance became core aspects of Lincoln\u2019s character, and he would one day give the same advice his law partner Stephen Logan gave him, that what matters is whether a person \u201ckeeps up his labors and efforts until middle life.\u201dThe author brought here a letter that Lincoln wrote to his friend, Speed, which give an idea about L\u2019s understanding of his own melancholy. He mentioned \u201cthree kinds of trouble that could beset a person with a nervous temperament: poor weather, isolation or idleness, and stressful events.\u201dLincoln\u2019s inclination to humor and poetry helped him a lot get through his middle years. A poem by William Knox, which the author tries to explain is quite overwhelming. It\u2019s called: \u2018Oh, why should the spirit of mortal be proud!\u2019 And yes, it is now on my desk!\nThird part:\n\u201cIn his mid-forties, the dark soil of his melancholy began to bear fruit.\u201d Strategies Lincoln used to come to terms with his nature, helped him build an ethic that one can never achieve perfection, but can always strive to achieve it.Political history is described subsequently in part three, ranging from the formation of political parties to political debates, including but not limited to, how L struggled through his political career. House divided speech is also beautifully explained. It was rather fun to go through the excruciating details about how Lincoln became Mr. President.\u201cWell boys, your troubles are over but mine have just begun\u201d: his work commences.The last chapter was a delight with 'Meditation on the Divine Will' statement, Gettysburg Address and his Second Inaugural Address in close proximity to each other.\u201cFondly do we hope \u2013 fervently do we pray\u201d I can never get tired of saying this!Lincoln\u2019s strategy to free slaves, and thereby rendering the confederates powerless portrays a fine example of his political genius.At the end, even accounts of his last day are splendidly put by the author.In all parts, the names of chapters could not have been better.\nEpilogue:\nFast facts about L: he liked popcorn. Oysters. Strong coffee. Wore silk hat on special occasions, and of beaver for everyday.\nTakeaways for those who do feel melancholic:\nStrategies L suggested to his friend, Speed, which have not worn out till today and never will: Keep busy, even in mundane activities. Avoid being idle. Engage in some business, or go to making preparations for it, which would be the same thing.P.S.: Another Lincoln text is staring at, compelling, me right now from my unread pile.

Yet I find myself always pleasantly disappointed to find that there is always someone willing to look at the great man from a different angle. Such is Joshua Shenk's book about Lincoln's battles with depression.  He documents two specific and major psychological breakdowns that while incapacitating for a short period of time (reading Lincoln's correspondence during these periods 'I am truly the most miserable man on earth' or his sadly concise 'I am not well' is truly heartbreaking) also provided the foundations to spur him forward and achieve the greatness he believed he was destined for.  What I really enjoyed about this book is the author does not claim to know Lincoln as few of even his closest friends could claim that. What he does is examine not only the documented record, but gives weight to the oral histories of the people who knew him and his melancholy best. By way of example, I wasn't aware of the shift at the turn of the 20th century by scholars away from oral histories as legitimate source material. While it can no doubt be unreliable and subject to the motivations of the person giving the testimony, it is also an invaluable resource. We can read Lincoln write that he is miserable, but to have the oral history of a friend describing how he would enter a room and find Lincoln sitting in a chair, staring into space with a look of incalculable grief on his face humanises Lincoln and adds a layer of complexity that is vital to understanding the man.

The book's premise is that Mr. Lincoln suffered from melancholy. Today, many would consider his suffering as clinical chronic depression. I think the book does speculate a lot, as it is impossible to really know how severe it was. However, based on writings of Lincoln himself and his contemporaries, it is highly likely he did suffer from depression at times. At one point early in his career, Lincoln does contemplate suicide, and he may have published a poem anonymously about suicide. Moreover, it's undeniable that Lincoln had a natural gloomy, contemplative countenance and aura about him. Evidence for that is all over the place from numerous published accounts of his peers to portraits of the man. The author attempts to weave the analysis of Lincoln's mental health with his life story. He uses this linear progression of Mr. Lincoln's life to show how Lincoln learned how to adapt to his illness, and he shows the ways Lincoln used his suffering to see the world in a different way, and strategies he used to deal with depression, like humor. There is a lot to like about this book, and it contains many little stories about Lincoln that I haven't heard elsewhere. So, I would recommend this one with the understanding that there is a bit of speculation here, and we may never know the whole picture of Lincoln's mental health. Perhaps, that is best.
