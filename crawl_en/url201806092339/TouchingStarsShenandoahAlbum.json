This story was very well written and the characters were all very likable. My problem with this story had more to do with the ending or perhaps how the relationship between the main characters developed in this book. From the blurb you're given the impression that this is about two people who have been divorced and are now back together to consider a reconciliation. While this still stands true throughout the book, it's not really the main story.The story is really about how to people come to grips with the end of a marriage and how they deal with their children. See even though these two people were divorced for about 12 years, they never dealt with their divorced, they simply signed the papers and separated.Had i been told this from the very beginning i would have been ok with the ending but due to the misconception all i wanted to do was throw the book against the wall. While i may have found the author recently i have read the previous 3 books in the series and although the books are not predominantly romances, they are still part of the story. Not to mention we actually get to know the characters that end up together in the end and in this case, the heroine's chosen is not a person we really got to know in the book other than in passing. It may seem more realistic by the way things ended but to me it made no sense. Why give me hope if that was not what was planned.

I kept waiting for that slant to appear and if it had, I completely missed it.Gayle Fortman has been raising her sons alone for the last twelve or so years since her charming husband Eric chose his career as a broadcast journalist over being a father and husband. Now returned home after a near death experience in Afghanistan, Eric is trying to rebuild his life and a relationship with his boys.When Gayle divorced Eric, she and her sons built a life in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, they run the Daughter of the Stars bed and breakfast inn, and with the help of Travis Allen, a neighbor down the road, the little family has built a very good life together.Now that Eric has moved into the inn during his recovery, the family is a bit off balance. Being described as the most married divorced woman anyone has known, Gayle must revisit her feeling for Eric. Is Gayle ready to come to terms with her emotions and decide once and for all, what is best for her sons?The boys have grown up without a father and they too must decide what bond they wish to have with a man that has been absent most of their lives. Not without squabbles and door slamming, this family finds their answers and goes into the direction that will suit each of them.Played against a backdrop of a local historical play, Touching Stars entwines the past and present leaving the reader mesmerized with two different but completely related stories that easily entertains and fascinates.As you are reading, do not assume that you know the outcome of either storyline. Ms Richards weaves a tale that encompasses both the people and history of the Shenandoah Valley. Characters from previous books appear and hopefully, characters from this book will reappear in the next.Very much in the same tenor as Robin Carr, you will find Emilie Richards to be a gifted writer and dreamer."}, {"userName": "Sue ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45104365-sue", "userReview": "A very interesting book about the Shenandoah Valley( Va) in current and Civil War days, a youth archaeology camp, a divorced couple, teenage boys, an alternative story of Lincoln's assassination, PSTD, and quilting.

That being said, it was still a very enjoyable book, just not nearly as much focus on the quilts and quilting as there has been. Touching Stars tells the story of Gayle and Eric Fortman, who have already been divorced for twelve years. Eric is coming to stay for the summer at Gayle's inn, called Daughter Of The Stars, as he recoups from nearly being killed in Afghanistan. They are parents to three boys, who all, for various different reasons, are not in sync with their dad. The novel also revolves around a summer camp that all three boys are attending nearby, that is being spearheaded by their neighbor and close friend, Travis Allen, who turns out to have strong feelings for Gayle. This was an enjoyable read, although I missed not getting quite as much input on the quilting, however, Ms. Richards did take us back in time in several parts of the book, to help explain a mystery that revolved around the teens and what they were digging for(historical finds of some people who had lived in the area back in the 1800's). I did like this book, though perhaps not quite as much as the others. There is another book in this series, Sister's Choice, which I have ordered, and am looking forward to reading and reviewing."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10983379-chris", "userReview": "This review has been hidden because it contains spoilers.

Gives so much character detail and really delves into relationships. The relationship of Eric and Gayle - divorced. The relationhip of each of them with their three sons. This book would probably fit into the genre of women's fiction, Gayle eventually grows in herself as a woman by the time the book ends. Yet this is about Eric too. And then there is Travis. These books have hooked me in, I like women's fiction so long as its not too heavy!! I like the way she incorporates cameo sections of earlier times, this one set just at the end of the Civil War. Not being American it takes me a while to sort out sides! And oh I want a quilt. Can't see myself ever being able to make one, but I want to buy one for my bed.

The complex relationships between them are interplayed with a story about an old cabin on the property that is being excavated for an archeology camp.

It was predictable, but what kept me reading was the historical sub-plot. I had always believed what the history books said, that John Wilkes Booth was killed shortly after he assassinated President Lincoln. Yet in this book, the story is given that John Wilkes Booth recovered on a farm in the Shenandoah Valley. An archeological camp for teenagers is being held on the inn's property, where Booth supposedly recovered.I loved the fact I could pick up this book, out of order, & have an update on Helen Henry & Cissy from Wedding Ring.

Issues of divorce, relationships between ex-spouses, single parenting, basic personality differences, parent-child relationships, and teen sexuality, with a side story of a Civil War mystery (with its own parent-child relationships issues), are all presented in the context of an entertaining and engrossing story.
