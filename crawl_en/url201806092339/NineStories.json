(thank god for tivo and being able to freeze frame or slo-mo marisa tomei without having to hoarsely shout at ethan hawke and phillip seymour hoffman)so, it\u2019s very funny, of course, but also incredibly human and poignant and tragic. and while the tendency is to ridicule salinger for falling for a third-rate sitcom actress, it can\u2019t help but humanize and endear him to any of us who have totally, completely, and inexplicably fallen for someone\u20263) because i'm a shameless contrarian and all you fuckers love to rag on the man. so i really wanted to love this book. and it wasn't difficult. 4) because it's great. these stories are great. and they don\u2019t even feel like stories, but like nine strange impressionist sketches. i almost feel that each story should have started and ended with an ellipse... you kind of flow from one weird, fragmented sketch to the next -- from the laughing man, which makes you feel more like a child than any story you\u2019ve ever read, into bananafish which is loaded with more stunning and surreal imagery than should be allowed in one story, and then to Teddy\u2019s strange world of cruise ships and fate and genius children\u2026get in the ring, motherfuckers!"}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani", "userReview": "Nine Stories = A Perfect Day for Bananafish (1948), Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut (1948), Just Before the War with the Eskimos (1948), The Laughing Man (1949), Down at the Dinghy (1949), For Esm\u00e9 \u2013 with Love and Squalor (1950), Pretty Mouth and Green My Eyes (1951), De Daumier-Smith's Blue Period (1952), Teddy (1953), J.D.

Salinger was a heck of a writer, certainly well known for his classic, The Catcher in the Rye, but there is much more out there, like this little jewel for example. I give this 5 stars on the strength of two stories alone, but they all were good. The two stories I mention are A Perfect Day for Bananafish, and For Esme - With Love And Squalor. Both have themes involving troubled soldiers returning from World War II. Salinger's experiences in the war certainly influenced his writing, and may have been partly responsible for his reclusiveness for the last 45 years of his life.Update: September 2017 is the release of the movie \"Rebel in The Rye\", which is based on the autobiography J.D. Salinger: A Life by Kenneth Slawenski. I look forward to reading the book and seeing the movie to learn more about this interesting man."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david", "userReview": "If I can get serious for a moment, and cast aside the brittle, smartassed, persona that the social networking aspect of goodreads tends to bring out, I'd like to try to express what it is that drives me in this life. It is the following belief, instilled primarily by my mother, an exceptionally smart woman who never suffered fools gladly, but had the mitigating grace to be one of the warmest, most generous women you could ever hope to meet, as well as having one of the greatest voices you can imagine  (Buttercup)  Here's the main thing she taught me: each of us has an inescapable responsibility to take whatever talent we have been given on this earth, and to develop it as far and as well as life allows.This is so deeply ingrained in my beliefs that I can pretty much trace every major decision I've made in my life back to it.What does this have to do with the price of eggs? Well, it's the reason Jerome David Salinger makes me as mad as all get out. Because I can certainly understand why, given the perfection of the stories in this collection, any writer might not want to risk spoiling his reputation by following up with work that might not reach the same level. Hell, nothing could possibly reach the perfection of the stories, \"For Esme - with Love and Squalor\", \"The Laughing Man\", \"Down by the Dinghy\", or \"Just Before the War with the Eskimos\". And while I'm not really a great fan of Seymour Glass, \"A Perfect Day for Bananafish\" is pretty damned awesome as well.So, yeah, J.D. - after those stories, it's hard to imagine anything better. Even anything comparable.But that's still no excuse for not trying, you arrogant egotistical bastard. You were dealt a monumental, unimaginable, talent. And for you to squat there in-fucking-communicado in your bloody bunker in New England, resting on your admittedly golden freaking laurels, is an act of unconscionable, unpardonable, selfishness.

When the prosecution rested and the defence opened, their lawyer would simply have issued a copy of Nine Stories to all 12 jurors and said \"Ladies and gentlemen, I rest my case.\"This is not to say that each of the Nine is such a great golden glowing nugget of controlled power, insight and wisdom (some are) but that the whole is such eloquent proof of the perspicacity, intelligence and all-round humanbeingness of JDS that reading this collection is very bittersweet - how lovely it all is, and how very little of it there is, when duller, pudgier-fingered writers type on, and on, and publish, and publish. Anyone who has encountered comments by myself on Ye Olde Catcher in Ye Rye will now accuse me of inconsistency, or at least, be expecting me to accuse JDS of the same. How can I hate the novel for its unbearable whine and Johnny-one-note somebody-shut-him-up-please tiresomeness and yet enjoy all the rest of JDS as I do? They're cut from the same cloth, it's not like Picasso's blue period and Picasso the cubist which could have been different guys, or the Velvet Underground's first and third albums which could have been a different band. But I've come across this in different areas of the universe - can't stand Tom Waits until Swordfishtrombones, think he's a genius for three albums, then can't stand him again. Shakespeare's tragedies - oui! Shakespeare's comedies - er, non! So maybe not that unusual.JDS famously published all his stuff between 1951 and 1963 and then STOPPED. (Which is why the kidnappers pounced, they gave him a good ten year rest and that was ENOUGH to their way of thinking.) And he stopped just as things were getting really interesting. He writes of the murderous conformities of American educated middle-class life and of the outcasts and especially young kids who either subvert this button-down world or bail out swiftly. Just as he stopped publishing things began to change. the 60s began swinging, and the youthquake (as it has been termed) was upon us. Just the very stuff that you might have thought would have fascinated JD. What do the kids do when they try to make their own rules up? I feel the absence of JDS throughout the 60s and 70s, as i feel the absence of another American writer who STOPPED in 1963, Sylvia Plath. I want to know what these two clever clogs would have made of the tumultuous ten years which followed the self-stilling of their voices. But back to the Nine Stories - and to steal a fellow reviewer's catch-phrase:Is it a classic? Answer : Yes. Goddamn!PS : I realise I also speculated upon the advisability of kidnapping Thomas Bernhard elsewhere but that was to save the world from any further novels like Extinction, whereas the JD Salinger kidnap is for the opposite reason. But I would like to publicly state that I do not condone the imprisonment of any writers for any reasons, so please don't try this at home."}, {"userName": "Rolls", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18657-rolls", "userReview": "Salinger's \"Nine Stories\" should be renamed \"How to Write Short Stories.\" While many hold up \"Catcher in the Rye\" as the zenith of his achievements for me it will always be this wistful and brave little book. I re-read it two or three times or year. I love it that much. To be honest out of the nine stories collected here I would say that only a third are Salinger's best. \"Perfect Day for Banafish,\" \"For Esme - With Love and Squalor,\" and \"The Laughing Man\" are to me the peaks of short fiction. Everything that Salinger does best he does in these three tales. Nobody wrote children better than him. They leap off the page at you right into your lap. Esme, her brother, Seymour's little friend and the narrator of \"Laughing Man\" are so vivid and real you feel like running them all down the street for ice cream and cake. They are that true to life. Same goes for Seymour in \"Banana Fish\" and the narrator of \"For Esme.\" Nobody got into the heads of brilliant but troubled young people better than Salinger. What we hear about Seymour as opposed to what we see creates a palpable (and beautiful)tension. The narrator of \"For Esme\"'s war inflicted emotional problems are drawn with such artistry as to flood over you as you read. \"Uncle Wiggly in Connecticut,\" \"Daumier-Smith's Blue Period,\" and \"War with the Eskimos\" to me fall into the \"damn entertaining but not great\" category. These stories are beautifully observed, funny, poignant and always a pleasure to read but lack that magic the first three have to spare. Of course that being said even being good but not great Salinger makes them better than most.Finally \"Teddy,\" \"Down in the Dinghy\" and \"Pretty Mouth Green My Eyes\" are good stories but I feel they suffer from being collected in the same book as the others. Each alone is enthralling but not a one of them is a patch on \"Esme,\" or \"Bananafish.\" Where the other stories feel like a full meal these come off more like snacks. Tasty but not quite filling.If you like Salinger and want to read something by him that won't make you want to shoot a president or a sixties rock star this my friend is the book for you."}, {"userName": "Kenny", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1642452-kenny", "userReview": "\u201cEach of his phrases was rather like a little ancient island, inundated by a miniature sea of whiskey.\u201d\nOh J.D., why couldn\u2019t you have published more of these amazing stories in your life time???\nNine Stories\n -- a collection of brilliant short stories from J.D. Salinger. It is in this collection where the Glass family, the main constituents of \nFranny and Zooey,\n is first introduced. In the next eight stories, we meet and get to know characters with an assortment of mental and physical ailments, and self-discoveries.This is my second journey with Salinger after \nFranny and Zooey.\n My favorites here are \nTo Esme \u2013 With Love and Squalor,\n \nThe Laughing Man,\n \nDe Daumier-Smith\u2019s Blue Period,\n and \nTeddy.\n A shared thread through all nine stories is the mood of desperation, of frustration, and of higgledy-piggledy identities. The characters are very real; these are real people with real issues starting to overspill into their everyday lives.These stories haunted me. I found \nTo Esme \u2013 With Love and Squalor\n a story about the effects of war on an individual stayed with me for days. It\u2019s so simply written, and yet, packs so much emotion and observation on the state of war and the mental and physical drain it can take on one person. From the one line note about a twitch on the face, to a shaky hand, the subtle differences from the first half of the story to the second half create an overall dreadful vision.What is \nDe Daumier-Smith\u2019s Blue Period\n -- loneliness, isolation, misrepresentation, reinvention, escape, connection? Who is Jean De Daumier-Smith -- we never really know since this the name the narrator calls himself. The fact that we never know Jean\u2019s real name is significant; it serves to highlight the idea of misrepresentation and reinvention. Jean appears to be uncomfortable with who he is and by changing his name Salinger allows Jean to reinvent himself. The trigger for Jean wishing to reinvent himself stems from the loneliness and isolation that he feels possibly due to his mother\u2019s death. By reinventing himself, Jean is able to escape from the painful realities of the world around him. We, all of us, can relate.This collection of stories should be read over and over again. When I next read these stories I\u2019ll discover something new about one of the characters or catch a new allusion or reference. What insights will I glean about the Glass family?I could go on forever about the themes here. I could write pages about these people. I wonder where Esme is now. What will become of Teddy? Does the Chief find love and is he actually The Laughing Man? It's what's left unsaid here that really intrigues.

Normally news of celebrity death does little but placate my immense Schadenfreude, but Salinger's death is a serious blow to me and I feel compelled to emote all over my computer screen (don't worry, I have tissues).Who remembers the moment when they first fell passionately in love with reading? I'm not talking about when you realized that reading was enjoyable, or a good distraction from your family, or a great way to spend a sunny day in the park. I'm talking about when you realized that this was it: life could throw anything at you and, as long as you had reading, you could cope and move on. That rather than simply entertaining, your world could be expanded and fleshed out by what you glean through a page- that this great human fuck-up can best be understood by placing yourself within the head of strangers and seeing the world through their eyes for a time.I can chart the exact instant this thought struck me- when I first finished reading Salinger's Nine Stories, particularly the utterly heart-breaking \"A Perfect Day for Bananafish.\" To this day this book is still my favorite of his limited oeuvre and a surefire contender for Top 5 favorites of all time. While he is deservedly renowned for Holden Caulfield's teen angst, it is the subtle pathos of Nine Stories that marks him as an author without equal. The alienated Seymour Glass, who I always pictured as a stand-in for Salinger himself, and his tragic inability to connect with anyone but young children. The prescient Teddy, whose thinly-veiled Buddhism came years before the Beats began reading Suzuki. Esme, Charles and the damaged Sergeant X- all three of whom I feel an unceasing tenderness for. The idolized Chief and the heartbreak of Mary Hudson. All of these stories I can return to again and again, myself changed by the passing of time, and find something new and rewarding to take from them. Whether it is his absolutely perfect dialogue (I know of no other author who so accurately captures the rhythm and cadence of speech), his impulse (need?) to include a death in nearly all of his stories as if to remind us that even imaginary friends can get hit by buses, his endless attempts to put into words the passive disconnection from the rest of humankind that we all, at one point or other, feel overwhelmed by. There is more literary merit in this slim volume than the whole New York Times bestseller list.I've often harbored the dream of hanging out in Salinger's tiny New Hampshire village and somehow attracting the eye of the reclusive author- carrying groceries across the street or some such menial chore. We would get to talking and he would offer to read some of my meager works and, wonder of wonders, offer a few words of advice. You know, Daydreaming 101. Sadly this will never be. If there is a bright side to this tragic passing, it is that hopefully he\u2019s been writing feverishly for the past 60 years and his estate will begin posthumously publishing. This is the only real kind of immortality available, and hopefully Salinger's words will be read for centuries to come."}, {"userName": "F", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8161922-f", "userReview": "I worked through this book slowly.

For once I don't care about getting older. This wasn't about that. So I started rereading Nine Stories in my car on my work lunch breaks. Getting through the day necessities stuff. I really needed an old friend. I was at a loss in a bad depths of despair kinda way that I cannot put in a meaningful way that will mean shit to anyone else. I remembered Nine Stories was good to me. I'm in no mood for anything more than that. Friends.This probably won't make any sense to people who don't struggle with stupidity. There's a sick cloud feeling in my head that I get when I try to understand math, or something like that that requires logical thought. I never read instructions, either. I've been feeling this sick, cloudy feeling of anxious stupidity for no math related reasons. Just in general. It really sucks. So Salinger is my breath of fresh air from that feeling. I find I don't want to read anything but short stories right now.And other feelings... (I have a feeling I've mentioned this elsewhere on goodreads. Oh well.) When I was a kid (four?) I read this Peanuts comic strip. Charlie Brown was struggling to explain his mixed up feelings of being sad, happy, angry, all those free-range emotions, all at one time. I quoted that to my family to try to explain how I was feeling. They laughed their asses off. I slunk off to mood all by myself. It's really not about getting older. I'm still doing that. I've never found a better way than Charlie to explain that stuff. All of my moods are Peanuts broods... Anyway. Those feelings led to my reread. I needed them all. (You already wrote a review intro, Mariel. I can have more than one! Picking books is serious business! All at once!) I remembered four of the nine stories well, the rest not at all. Shit. This throws new light on the ethics of my memory and reviewing books I read a long time ago. It's not a comfortable feeling. (Not that I won't still do it.) I'll include my old thoughts if I remember any.A Perfect Day for Bananafish:Confession: I totally got into J.D. Salinger because of Robert Smith of The Cure. (According to youtube, there is a band named Bananafishbones.) Bananafishbones - The CureI did remember this story. Of course I did. Old Mariel thoughts: This Muriel girl sucks. (I'm interested in all literary Mariels, Muriels, d other avariations on that theme. I draw the line at Mary. Mary-Ellens need not apply either. Who has the time?)I don't remember my old thoughts well enough. Did I relate to Seymour more? I think I relate to him more now just because I remember that old me had a massive inferiority complex when it came to precocious kids. Not that I enjoy the company of three year old girls (I've spent enough time in the company of ones related to me). Now? She wasn't all that precocious. Seymour is the permanently precocious. My ex once told me that kids stared at me because they sensed that I was one of them. I don't like him for saying that. I know too well the feeling of talking to people who respond as Seymour and Buddy do to their young girl friends. I get exactly those kinds of responses. It actually feels really lonely.This wasn't what was in my head while I was rereading in my car. What is special about the precocious? The ability to surprise. It isn't lack of artifice, or knowing rules. That simply isn't true. (The little girl reminded me of mind games that older girls would play on a boyfriend with her jealousy of the younger girl he was friends with.)It isn't good, the preoccupation with what other people notice. I don't want to think about relating to Seymour being offended when he thought the girl in the car was looking at his feet.I've said it all before about this thing about strangers. The great things about kids is that they are all strangers. There's something about talking to strangers who don't know all other threads to heap onto everything else to the point they can't listen to the point of what you're feeling. Maybe I don't really want to talk about suicide on goodreads. It has been in my life. There's a part of my brain that splits: 1. The person who dies. It's not up to me. Why would anyone want to go on living if they CAN'T go on living? 2. The people left behind. I've almost been them. I don't want to be them. That stuff I wrote earlier about threads... It's too much. This time... I was only feeling Seymour side. It's that kinda story.I didn't feel less lonely reading this one. I'm not sure what I felt except... I don't know. There's a time when leading someone else to look at bananafish isn't enough, when raising yourself isn't enough. Potential for what, anyway? Ruh roh, Raggy. If they are all this long this is gonna be a long ass review... Uncle Wiggily in ConnecticutConfession: I can't spell Connecticut without cheating.I didn't have invisible friends. I made friends out of inanimate objects. I've never really and truly stopped doing that. To myself I describe it as my Tom Hanks in Castaway with Wilson the Volley Ball moments. I'll stop ever doing it when I don't feel like that. Castawayed.I loved it when Jimmy gets killed and the little girl immediately replaces him with a new best friend. When a little kid I maimed my paper Care Bear doll (cut his leg off) and then couldn't stop crying over the loss of his leg (with vows of never hurting him again). I feel an affinity with Ramona. I'm sure she killed him for the tragedy of it all. (Or it really was the dog's fault.)I had a depressing feeling off this one. Maybe I get this from other Salinger females, like their good times end when they pretend not to be young anymore? I loved it when the mom, Eloise, wants reassurement of her past from her college friend, Mary Jane. What is the fun in being a dinner party person, anyway? Cocktails, dinner parties: same difference.Just Before the War with the Eskimos:No confessions. (I'm not admitting to once writing a really bad story about an eskimo.)I found reassuring so much the details like Selena coming back in a dress when she had been wearing shorts. (Even if it didn't annoy Ginnie as it normally would have.) I'd have been steamed. I hate waiting. I hate waiting soooo much. I hate it when people know you are waiting and run errands and shit. It gives me a sick and frustrated feeling. Anyway.I hope Ginnie will appreciate others noticing the interesting details, and how they put them, in more worthier people than Selena, her brother or his friend. What a shame. Younger me probably felt sad that she crushed on a guy who liked her (probably) prettier and more socially at ease sister. I probably also noted that Eric spoke like someone Holden would find annoying (his \"grand\" and all). I've always wanted to save people in stories from uninteresting characters. \"You can do better!\"P.s. The Eskimos will go after the French first. Maybe they don't wanna be named after a dessert cake any longer.The Laughing Man:Confession: Talk of athetlics of any kind usually make my eyes glaze over. I admit to having an \"Oh fuck\" moment. I'm a jerk.I loved this story. I feel so much impatience with stories about beautiful people. It means fuck all to me to read the word beautiful. In this story the Chief and his Mary Hudson are beautiful like heroes of memory, and of stories. I feel embarrassed trying to describe this. I loved the Laughing Man stories that he told the kids. You know what? I haven't done a list in ages.Coolest bus drivers:1. Chief2. Bus-Driver Stu from The Adventures of Pete and Pete3. Otto from The SimpsonsIt occurs to me now that Bus-Driver Stu holding the kids hostage to his relationship problems might've been a nod to this story. Awesome. Pete and Pete makes me happy like almost nothing else does. It's like ideals like how The Laughing Man does beauty. Not definitions, just living as day to day without reading the rules first. I suck at describing this. If I were them I'd never forget those stories either.Down at the Dinghy:My confessions are embarrassing. I'm not gonna tell the story of when I tried to run away. It's not a nice story like this one.I didn't remember this story despite once naming a bird I took care of after Boo Boo.It must be great to have a mom like Boo Boo. For Esme- with Love and Squalor:I liked this story much more as an adult than I did as a teenager. I was too close in age to Esme, perhaps. I was probably jealous of Esme because she was so smart for her age (I may as well confess that smart kids make me feel really bad about being a dumb adult). No poise either. But that doesn't matter at all. Old me! It was so sweet the way the brother and sister were with each other. How Esme missed her father (she was likely jealous of her mama so I wasn't that unusual as a teen, I guess)... Anyway, it made me happy how happy Buddy is to have his letter. I'm glad that he wrote his story and engaged more than his brother did with his girl friends. Friendships should be more than something the other cannot understand.Pretty Mouth and Green My Eyes:I am losing steam with this one. I felt bad for Arthur... but I didn't want to spend time in their marriage problems. It makes me uncomfortable to hear about them. There's nothing I can do for them. You know?I did read that PJ Harvey made a nod to this story title in her song Angelene. This is one of my all-time favorite Peejay songs. Thanks, wikipedia trivia! De Daumier-Smith's Blue Period:\"The fact is always obvious much too late, but the most singular difference between happiness and joy is that happiness is a solid and joy a liquid.\"I feel disconnected with much of this story, as with 'Pretty Mouth'. Blame my desperate impatientness for something... Maybe I want a life affirming day that beats any bananafish day, or anything. Something more sustaining. What the hell is gonna happen next? Teddy:Teddy is right. It isn't so good that way, loving for the sake of loving. Sighs. But I do think too much. I wonder how Seymour would like talking to Teddy. He'd meditate and not give practiced answers, for sure. No pet nothing. Number two reasons this time. The little girl... Number one too. It's complicated.It did help. I'll always need more. I think, though, that Salinger didn't owe anybody to publish anything. (I'll always need more. That's exhausting.) Not any more than Seymour did with what he put out. I guess it's not always a perfect day for bananafish. I'm so glad these were published, though. I needed them like Buddy. It's not all a smile. I've already said that lame-o stuff about my Peanuts emotions. That's the best I've got. I wish I had better.

All the stories, even when I didn\u2019t love them, had small moments of either brilliance or craziness. And Salinger was a master of the quirky, zany dialogue full of 50s slang, non sequiturs and sarcastic repartees. There were laugh-out-loud moments, there were bizarre moments where I had no idea what he was on about, there was hyperbole galore, and there was much of the 1940s swagger that I first met (and loved) in The Catcher in the Rye. Once or twice I suspected the narrator was more or less unreliable, and this, too, of course (viz. to some extent Holden) Salinger masters. A few choice excerpts:From \u2018A Perfect Day for Bananafish\u2019:She was a girl who for a ringing phone dropped exactly nothing. She looked as if her phone had been ringing continually ever since she had reached puberty.From \u2018Just before the War with the Eskimos\u2019:He was staring down, with his slack mouth ajar, at his injured finger. \u2018What?\u2019 he said.\u2018How did you cut it?\u2019\u2018Goddam if I know\u2019, he said, his inflection implying that the answer to that question was hopelessly obscure. \u2018I was lookin\u2019 for something in the goddam wastebasket and it was fulla razor blades.\u2019\u2018You Selena\u2019s brother?\u2019 Ginnie asked.\u2018Yeah, Christ, I\u2019m bleedin\u2019 to death. Stick around. I may need a goddam transfusion.\u2019From \u2018Teddy\u2019:Mr. McArdle played leading roles on no fewer than three daytime radio serials when he was in New York, and he had what might be called a third-class leading man\u2019s speaking voice: narcissistically deep and resonant, functionally prepared at a moment\u2019s notice to out-male anyone in the same room with it, if necessary even a small boy.A comment by precocious Teddy himself (about his parents):I mean they don\u2019t seem able to love us just the way we are. They don\u2019t seem able to love us unless they can keep changing us a little bit. They love their reasons for loving us almost as much as they love us, and most of the time more.And then of course, there\u2019s the fantastically titled \u2018For Esm\u00e9 \u2013 with Love and Squalor\u2019, which has a number of marvelous lexical misunderstandings.Recommended for people who like Salinger and short stories."}, {"userName": "Jeanette  \"Astute Crabbist\"", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/796425-jeanette-astute-crabbist", "userReview": "This is one of \"those\" books. The ones where I turn the final page and sigh and wonder how I can convince other people that it's worth reading. Consider this: There are 30,520 ratings for this book here on Good Reads. The average of all those ratings is 4.18. Nothing I could say would be more convincing than that. Read it and marvel. My two favorite stories are For Esme--With Love and Squalor, and Down at the Dinghy. I think I liked these best because I love the way Salinger writes about children. Tender and charming without ever being cutesy. I fell in love with the precocious Esme within the space of a few pages. I wanted a whole book about her! Down at the Dinghy features a sensitive little boy in self-exile on the family dinghy, and the way his mother gently coaxes him to come back up to the house. This is Salinger's true genius---creating perfect word pictures of ordinary events. Nine Stories should be required study for every creative writing program. An unpretentious, seemingly effortless, utterly original voice. If I could write just ONE story comparable to these, I'd be so puffed up with pride I'd bust right outta my corset!NB: The first story, A Perfect Day for Bananafish, can be quite jarring if you're not familiar with the Glass family featured in the novel Franny and Zooey. Seymour is the eldest child of that family, and always referred to in the past tense or at a remove in Salinger's other works. This is your one chance to see him while he's still alive.

I nove racconti sono, nessuno escluso, tra i pi\u00f9 belli e stilisticamente perfetti che abbia mai letto, e ci\u00f2 anche per merito della eccellente traduzione di Carlo Fruttero, che ne sottolinea la ricchezza linguistica esaltandone la pregevole fattura. Si intuisce, a monte di questa prosa essenziale, vivida e incisiva, un lavoro di lima meticoloso, per non dire maniacale; cos\u00ec che ogni costruzione sintattica e ogni scelta lessicale divengano perfettamente funzionali alle esigenze espressive e alla poetica programmatica dell'autore. Chiunque si cimenti nel campo letterario dovrebbero fare proprio questo procedimento compositivo, per evitare inconcludenti lungaggini descrittive, sommarie esposizioni di eventi senza capo n\u00e9 coda, o elementari pretenziosi svolazzi lirici, che denunciano la pi\u00f9 assoluta mancanza di talento. \u200bSalinger invece di talento ne ha a profusione: descrive nei minimi dettagli l'aspetto e i gesti dei suoi personaggi, ne riproduce le conversazioni tramite dialoghi espressivi, realistici e per nulla generici, ma soprattutto riesce a rendere il lettore non un mero spettatore esterno ed estraneo ai fatti e agli stati d'animo, ma quasi un protagonista tra i protagonisti, emotivamente coinvolto e partecipe in prima persona.A fronte di una contestualizzazione tanto accurata, sorprende il finale che lo scrittore riserva alle singole storie: qualcosa di sospeso, di aperto a interpretazioni diverse, di appena delineato e non detto, doloroso, inquietante, acre, commovente, spiazzante. Tutto ci\u00f2 mi ha richiamato alla mente, per associazione di idee, gli esiti poetici del contrasto tra finito e non finito nell'opera di Michelangelo scultore. Per Michelangelo la forma, la figura scultorea, \u00e8 gi\u00e0 racchiusa, come imprigionata, nella materia informe, ossia nel blocco di marmo; per portarla alla luce occorre un processo di sottrazione, che consiste nel \"levare il soverchio\", la pietra in eccesso, fino, talora, alla levigatura pi\u00f9 esasperata che cattura e rifrange la luce. Pura fisicit\u00e0.Schiavo detto Atlante - Firenze, Galleria dell'AccademiaIn alcune sculture, specie dell'et\u00e0 pi\u00f9 matura, l'artista sceglie per\u00f2 di lasciare alcune parti, pi\u00f9 o meno estese, appena sbozzate, ruvide e come graffiate dallo scalpello, utilizzando il non finito come strumento tecnico espressivo volto a sottolineare i concetti che ispirano il suo genio compositivo: la tensione eroica verso il bello, l'assoluto, l'infinito; il conflitto tra corpo e spirito, tra la vita e la morte; e, pi\u00f9 in generale, ad esprimere l'inesprimibile: ci\u00f2 che nessun linguaggio appare adeguato a chiarire o concretizzare.Piet\u00e0 Rondanini, 1552-64, Milano, Castello SforzescoLo stesso sembra fare Salinger, che con la parola definita e levigata libera la pura fisicit\u00e0 dei suoi personaggi dalla prigionia del silenzio, ma attraverso il suo particolare non finito/non detto tralascia di spiegare l'inspiegabile, ossia lo spirito, l'interiorit\u00e0, i sentimenti, le paure, i rimpianti, le pulsioni pi\u00f9 intime e segrete dell'animo umano. E, come deve essere, lascia al lettore la decodificazione del messaggio, utilizzando gli strumenti della sua personale sensibilit\u00e0 ed esperienza.Ciascun racconto compreso nella raccolta \u00e8 un piccolo scenario che si apre su un mondo, una storia e molte vite, compresa quella di chi legge.Straordinaria esperienza."}, {"userName": "Tristan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3781470-tristan", "userReview": "Not being too fond of Salinger\u2019s Catcher in the Rye \u2013 and having, in fact, a vivid recollection of me chucking it after about a 100 pages into a far-flung, dusty corner out of sheer tedium in high school (reading assignments are hemlock for stubborn minds) - I wasn\u2019t particularly looking forward to his short story collection. Would it just be an assortment of variations on Holden Caulfield? I feared the worst. Boy was I happy to be proven wrong. Talk about rising to low expectations, huh? How I wish now that the scholastic \"authorities\" had assigned us this instead of that boorish novel. In that case, I wouldn't have had to look up an online summary to pass my bloody test. In fact, I might have even been stupid enough to found a hipsterish J.D. Salinger worship cult. A missed opportunity, I tell ya! These subtle tales are replete with memorable, flawed, authentic (non-irritating!) characters one can invest in. Clear highlights are A Perfect Day for Bananafish and especially the poignant, immensely moving For Esm\u00e9 \u2013 With Love and Squalor, but they are all fine examples of quality writing. Not a dud in the bunch.Turning the last page, it is hard not to feel a pang of sadness, of irretrievable loss.

I had this feel that in some way, the stories represented our disconnections from one another, from reality, and from full knowledge; the slippery grasp we have of our perceptions, and our tendency to judge too quickly. Salinger often gets this across through arresting dialogue among individuals, typically with at least one of the individuals in some way being \"different\" from your \"normal\" standards. Entering the inner world of a Salinger character is an experience everyone should have. His children are the best I\u2019ve experienced; as are his hard-edged, outcast characters -- you know the type: they chain smoke, say \u201cgoddamn\u201d a lot, and have a sharp, smartass tongue that bespeaks toughness. Yet it gets revealed that they\u2019ve been hurt in some way in the past, and that they have a soft spot inside. Salinger shows this in some beautiful ways and eventually, by the end of the story, you see a special side to these people. Characters that at first seemed ridiculous and entertaining end up making you see something in them. Yes they\u2019re faltered and off, but they\u2019re also special, and you see that their reality may in fact be superior to yours.. at least in some ways. Isn\u2019t that true of children, in general? That they see the world in specifically different ways from us adults? And aren't some of these paradigms innocent, beautiful, and pure? Or maybe it's exactly because they don't have a paradigm, that this is the case. While we can't escape from all of our preconceived notions, they are free from them. Even some of Salinger\u2019s non-children characters have this element to their personality.A lot of the endings to these stories are phenomenal. They always contain a surprise, sometimes with room for broad interpretation; typically making you think and reflect. Yet there\u2019s still a feeling of mystery; of not knowing the full story. Through these endings your interpretation of what you had read, changes; the way you saw the story shifts, often resulting in quick, new perceptions and \u201caha!\u201d moments. And, if your experience is like mine, you then continue to reflect and question your perceptions of the story further.I couldn\u2019t quite give this five stars. Some of the stories, such as Just Before the War with the Eskimos and Down at the Dinghy didn\u2019t flow enough for me, and ended up lacking in either coherence or emotional pull. (By the way, my star ratings per story are in the picture above, just to the left of each story listed. You can change Teddy from a 4.5 to a 5, too. It started as a 4; I thought about it more, and gave it a 4.5; then today, I thought about it even more and have decided that it\u2019s a 5. That\u2019s what some of these stories can do to you: They really get you thinking.)The other Salinger I\u2019ve read is The Catcher and the Rye, which I\u2019ve read twice and enjoy, but come up short of loving. After reading this I can further see how Salinger has a following that loves him. His characters are unusual and intriguing, and his way of viewing the world is special and ingenious.

I remember the book polarizing the class, and I was firmly on the side of our boy Holden Caulfield being an overall turd and obnoxious narrator. Looking back on that experience, I felt like I had missed out on enjoying some part of important literature. When I came across Nine Stories in a Michael Chabon novel, I decided to dip my toes back into Salinger's limited catalogue.Nine Stories, then, was a decidedly more enjoyable experience than my previous educational exposure. These stories have the feeling of a low-budget indie movie: cracks are showing along the masks that Salinger's characters present to the world and you wonder if they will crumble. The opening story, A Perfect Day for Bananafish, seems quite standard until the final line left me stunned with its cool delivery of personal collapse. Uncle Wiggly in Connecticut and Just Before the War With the Eskimos present interesting female leads who seem to be wrestling with their place in the world and their very nature.Salinger uses dialogue throughout Nine Stories to convey heaps of information. His portrayal of characters is sparse and you'll find physical descriptions largely absent from these stories. In perhaps my favourite (and definitely the funniest!) of the collection, Pretty Mouth and Green My Eyes, the entire story is conveyed over a phone call between two gentleman, one of whom is stark-raving drunk. In the aforementioned A Perfect Day for Bananafish, the opening dialogue that at first seems so disconnected from the second half of the story is brought into relief by its closing lines. Much like my foray into Alice Munro's short stories, I found Nine Stories to be a bit of a mixed bag. Some of the stories in this collection were stunning--Teddy is up there with some of the coolest I've read this year--while others failed to keep me excited to keep going. Such is the gamble with a short story collection: you might not like every story! All the same, there's more in here that I appreciate than dislike, and my dislike is only minor. These stories didn't all blow me away as much as some other collections I've read this year, but they're still pretty damned good. I waffled between a three and four star rating on this one, and am going to go with a strong three, but very close to four. I'd recommend this short collection for anyone looking to take down a classic or reevaluate their opinion of Salinger!"}, {"userName": "Ubik 2.0", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13678685-ubik-2-0", "userReview": "La vita \u00e8 un caval donatoNon star\u00f2 a ripetere il solito mea culpa sulla narrativa breve, trascurata e subordinata ai romanzi, ritenuti a lungo non solo la migliore ma l\u2019esclusiva forma letteraria degna di nota.Poi mi sono imbattuto in Wallace e Carver, Saunders e la Munro ed altri ancora e le eccezioni sono diventate regola, ma ci\u00f2 non mi ha impedito di stupirmi di fronte a questa ennesima dimostrazione, firmata J.D.Salinger, della sottile mal\u00eca del racconto e delle sue pressoch\u00e9 infinite potenzialit\u00e0 allusive.Nel merito, cosa posso dire di questa eccellente raccolta, tanto scarna nel titolo quanto ricca nelle nove direzioni in cui l\u2019arte del narrare si spinge, una raccolta della quale tutto \u00e8 stato gi\u00e0 analizzato? Mi limito a citare i due aspetti che hanno maggiormente colpito la mia attenzione. Il primo \u00e8 la grande pregnanza dei dialoghi: quasi tutti i racconti sono costruiti con una precisione chirurgica improntata soprattutto all\u2019arte del dialogo; da qualche parte ho sentito usare per questi racconti l\u2019aggettivo \u201cradiofonici\u201d e penso che la definizione sia calzante perch\u00e9 sembrano davvero costruiti per essere recitati in dialogo, una voce a fare da contrappunto all\u2019altra con uno straordinario effetto musicale, talora dissonante ma sempre teso ad un significato superiore che, a sorpresa, si coglie (o cos\u00ec sembra) via via che il racconto procede o addirittura alla fine, in una visione retrospettiva che induce alla rilettura.Il secondo elemento, che pur a distanza di decenni mi riporta alla fulminante e decisiva lettura di \u201cIl giovane Holden\u201d (s\u00ec, sono uno di quelli\u2026), \u00e8 la capacit\u00e0 di dare voce, carattere, personalit\u00e0 ai bambini, cosa tutt\u2019altro che facile e scontata se si pensa quante volte abbiamo incontrato nei romanzi o nei film bambini petulanti, improbabili, sdolcinati, in una parola insopportabili! Qui invece la voce dei bambini \u00e8 resa con delicata appropriatezza, lasciando s\u00ec uno stridore insito nell\u2019et\u00e0 acerba della vocina ma sublimandone l\u2019effetto con una grande delicatezza, sorprendente se si pensa al leggendario caratteraccio dell\u2019autore\u2026"}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5512657-sara", "userReview": "Reading this short story collection helps me to understand why Salinger was hounded to the ends of the earth in an effort to make him write again.

I bought the book with a desire to revisit For Esme - With Love And Squalor and found it as captivating and moving as I had remembered, but the unexpected treasures of The Laughing Man and Teddy left me breathless. Salinger knows complete sorry, desperation and irony when he finds it. As we peep into the world of his characters, who smoke their endless cigarettes, carry on their conversations of double meaning, and attempt to connect with others, we cannot help nodding in recognition of the knowledge that this is a microcosm of the human condition."}, {"userName": "Fernando", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7665532-fernando", "userReview": "Nunca hab\u00eda le\u00eddo nada de J.D.

Respecto del primer libro debo decir que luego de leer brevemente de qu\u00e9 se trataba la historia desist\u00ed de leerlo al instante, puesto que no me atrae en absoluto leer la vida de un adolescente inconformista (aunque este comentario moleste a algunos lectores y me traiga inconvenientes). Mucho menos intentar\u00e9 leer la otra novela de la que deduzco se trata de temas similares.Leer \"Nueve Cuentos\" no me depar\u00f3 gran entusiasmo tampoco. Tal vez, mi idea o concepci\u00f3n de cuentos se asemeja m\u00e1s a otros estilos narrativos como por ejemplo el que propugnaba Edgar Allan Poe, creador del cuento moderno cuando afirmaba que un cuento deb\u00eda causar un \u201cefecto\u201d en el lector, para que este quedara atrapado hasta el final.He notado tambi\u00e9n que tal vez algunos novelistas no parecen dominar el terreno de cuentos como otros. No es lo mismo leer este tipo de cuentos que uno de Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Ray Bradbury o Guy de Maupassant. Ni que hablar de Edgar Allan Poe a quien nombrara anteriormente o de los cuentos de los grandes novelistas rusos como Dostoievski, G\u00f3gol o Tolstoi. Todos estos autores agreguen en sus cuentos caracter\u00edsticas dig\u00e1mosle efectistas que funcionan como hilo argumental de principio a fin y eso hace que me sienta muy a gusto al leerlos.Nada de eso me pas\u00f3 con los cuentos de Salinger. Los historias relatadas en ellos se iban de la misma forma que hab\u00edan llegado. Era tal mi aburrimiento que lleva a expresarlo en la p\u00e1gina 274, luego de haber le\u00eddo siete de los nueve que integran este volumen. Narraciones para mi gusto sin direcci\u00f3n aparente, largos di\u00e1logos intrascendentes o situaciones totalmente superfluas me llevaban a agradecer que el libro tuviera s\u00f3lo 286 p\u00e1ginas.Son pocos los cuentos que me atrajeron. A decir verdad s\u00f3lo uno, aunque hay dos que s\u00ed est\u00e1n bien construidos argumentalmente (seg\u00fan mi humilde punto de vista de lector). El cuento que m\u00e1s me gust\u00f3 fue \u201cUn d\u00eda perfecto para el pez pl\u00e1tano\u201d y qu\u00e9 casualidad: me encant\u00f3 casualmente por su final tan sorprendente.Los otros dos cuentos que me gustaron un poco m\u00e1s que el resto fueron, en primer lugar, \u201cTeddy\u201d, por las caracter\u00edsticas m\u00edstico-filos\u00f3ficas de su personaje principal y que encierra toda una concepci\u00f3n existencial del autor y \u201cPara Esm\u00e9, con amor y sordidez\u201d, por la forma en que el narrador, un agente del servicio secreto norteamericano en Inglaterra entabla una cari\u00f1osa relaci\u00f3n con Esm\u00e9 y su peque\u00f1o hermano Charles, acerca de lo que surge de esa charla en el bar y de los que le sucede a ese soldado tiempo despu\u00e9s. Not\u00e9 tambi\u00e9n que muchos cuentos est\u00e1n ambientados o durante la segunda guerra mundial o en \u00e9pocas de posguerra y lo que esto gener\u00f3 en algunos personajes de los cuentos.Menci\u00f3n final para el cuento \u201cEl per\u00edodo azul de Daumier-Smith\u201d. Un cuento escrito con iron\u00eda y en forma amena acerca de un joven pintor de diecinueve a\u00f1os que se hace pasar por un Maestro de la pintura, muchos a\u00f1os mayor, amigo de Picasso y que intenta hacerse pasar por profesor en una academia de arte dirigida por un peculiar se\u00f1or japon\u00e9s. Y nada m\u00e1s. El resto de los cuentos me pareci\u00f3 completamente intrascendentes. Simples relatos dirigidos a ninguna parte.No voy a discutir que Salinger es considerado uno de los padres de la narrativa contempor\u00e1nea; eso est\u00e1 muy claro y yo soy un simple (o triste) lector cuya impresi\u00f3n ante la lectura de sus cuentos no contribuye a nada pero bueno, a m\u00ed en particular leer sus cuentos me produjo una sensaci\u00f3n de aburrimiento y desinter\u00e9s que s\u00f3lo el pez pl\u00e1tano pudo salvar. Sin ofensas Sr. Salinger. No es nada personal, pero debo reconocer que este libro ir\u00e1 a reposar al estante de mi biblioteca por mucho, mucho tiempo."}, {"userName": "Patricia Nedelea", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52010441-patricia-nedelea", "userReview": "Spotless short stories.

Mi trovai come trascinato a pensare che qualunque cosa facessi per diventare un uomo capace di amministrare la sua vita con distacco, con buon senso o con eleganza, sarei sempre stato tutt\u2019al pi\u00f9 un visitatore in un giardino di orinali e pappagalli smaltati, con una cieca divinit\u00e0 di legno ritta in un angolo, vestita d\u2019un cinto armato\u00bb.Sono felice, persino orgogliosa di aver salutato il 2015 e inaugurato il 2016 in compagnia di un tipetto come Salinger. Feci la sua conoscenza nell\u2019agosto del 2011: il romanzo era Il giovane Holden, mostro sacrissimo, e mi piacque molto. Da allora, ho preso a dividere le persone che incontro in due macro-categorie: quelle che amano Il giovane Holden (facciamo amicizia?) e quelle a cui non \u00e8 piaciuto (sh\u00f2). So che si tratta di un pregiudizio letterario bello e buono, ma statisticamente ho rilevato che tendo a instaurare rapporti d\u2019amicizia con Holden-persone, mentre mi sento a disagio con non-Holden-persone. Se credete che il mio criterio per farsi buoni amici possa funzionare, siete liberi di adottarlo. Nell\u2019aprile del 2013 lessi Franny e Zooey. Mi piacque ancor di pi\u00f9 e mi diede le risposte che cercavo in un periodo psicologicamente complicato. Dovessi attraversare un\u2019altra crisi \u201cmistica\u201d, sar\u00e0 il primo libro da cui torner\u00f2. Ora che ho letto i Nove racconti, penso che sia legittimo annoverare Salinger tra i miei scrittori preferiti (alias miti letterari irraggiungibili e luminosi) e credo anche che trarr\u00f2 la pi\u00f9 grande soddisfazione da qualsiasi altro libro, racconto o lista della spesa da lui compilati. Il modo in cui Salinger scrive \u00e8 questo:lui prende la penna e, come un pittore, appoggia prima un segno, poi l\u2019altro. \u00c8 una tecnica vagamente impressionista, senza disegno, un tocco di colore accostato al precedente. Pian piano si forma una figura riconoscibile. Pian piano la figura \u00e8 inserita in uno spazio riconoscibile. Pian piano \u00e8 diventata una realt\u00e0, un oggetto solido, con tutti i dettagli al suo posto, e colori vividissimi. Puoi domandarti il suo significato, ma l\u2019impressione \u00e8 che quel quadro rappresenti solo se stesso, in modo quasi sfacciato, enigmatico. Come la Colazione dei Canottieri di Renoir, la cui composizione ossessiona l\u2019Uomo di Vetro nel Favoloso mondo di Am\u00e9lie. Il modo in cui Salinger scrive \u00e8 questo:essendo disperatamente umano. Non negando quel fondo di dolore che \u00e8 caratteristico di ogni umana esperienza: l\u2019esperienza della morte, l\u2019esperienza della guerra, l\u2019esperienza della crescita, l\u2019esperienza dei rapporti interpersonali. Per Esm\u00e9: con amore e squallore: fa piangere, non leggetelo in treno. Salinger e Dostoevskij premono i piedini sullo stesso pedale misticamente sensibile della mia mente. Il modo in cui Salinger scrive \u00e8 questo:perci\u00f2 che gli eredi si sbrighino a tirare fuori i suoi manoscritti inediti, per Dio!"}, {"userName": "Andrew Smith", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5885760-andrew-smith", "userReview": "To me, short stories always feel like sampling the chef\u2019s taster menu \u2013 afterward I never feel fully sated and just wish I could have had more of the courses I liked the most. It\u2019s set of appetisers without the satisfaction of a full meal. That said there was a lot here to admire and enjoy.Even a minimal amount of research on Salinger throws up the fact that as a GI in World War 2 he was traumatised by the Battle of the Bulge and Nazi concentration camps. So, it\u2019s not surprising to see this reflected in stories first published as a set in 1953. It\u2019s inherent in two of the best known stories: A Perfect Day for Banana Fish and For Esme - with Love and Squalor. In both the impacts of war on its participants is graphically depicted. War and anti-Semitism, also permeates some of the other tales. It feels like an ever-present backdrop to this set.The other theme here is that of religion and of mystical experiences. This takes the lead in two other stories: De Daumier-Smith\u2019s Blue Period and Teddy. I confess found these the hardest to warm to.Quite a few of the tales feature children having grown-up conversations with adults they\u2019ve not previously met. Children are the centre-point to a number of the episodes. These conversations are universally well drawn. In fact, all the conversations in all the stories feel real and alive, aided by the author\u2019s preference for using italics to emphasise certain words, or parts of words.My favourite is The Laughing Man, in which a revered leader (known as The Chief) regales young members of the Comanche Club, in the 1920\u2019s, with tales of a mythical hero. This story ends ambiguously but it\u2019s all in the telling, and the telling is very fine indeed.Overall a very rewarding collection: thought provoking, amusing and, I think, with some stories that will live long in the memory. It\u2019s certainly wetted my appetite to read more of Salinger\u2019s work."}], "description": "Nine Stories (1953) is a collection of short stories by American fiction writer J. D.
