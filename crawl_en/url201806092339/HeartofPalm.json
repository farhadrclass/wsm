The cover and the title may make you think that this is an easy chick lit story but there is a lot more substance to it. The story follows Arla Bravo who had to bring up her children on her own when Dean Bravo skipped town after a family tragedy. The family and town are put to the test when new developers come to Unita wanting to buy up their properties to build a fancy new marina. A development that will change their lives for the better whether they like it or not.Although Arla is the one walking with a cane the whole family limps along with their own baggage, and I got the impression they all secretly really liked being wrapped up in their own miseries.Unita is a small town where everyone knows each other, and the Bravo boys are the most notorious.Carlson is the big talking, risk taking eldest who became a financial manager in a nearby town. Frank manages the local restaurant and worries about everyone but himself. Sofia, well Sofia is handled with kid gloves as she is high strung and fragile. The Bravos should know as they took her to a psychologist. She is the one character I thought the author did not get right. Sofia is anything but fragile, in fact she is the most level headed of the lot. But then I realised that through the eyes of her family Sofia is viewed as the delicate one because it\u2019s easier to focus on HER disorders rather than looking at their own dysfunctions.This is a story about family bonds that can feel like a safety net and a prison at the same time.It was the perfect book to close of the year and I think fans of Joshilyn Jackson will enjoy this book"}, {"userName": "Sandra", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8476710-sandra", "userReview": "I put Smith's debut novel at the top of my list of my favorite books. It's set outside of St. Augustine, Florida in the fictional town of Utina, named for a native tribe. The beauty of this book lies in its characters. The Bravo family's a quirky and eccentric bunch who you will love. Smith's character development equals or surpasses any I've come across. The matriarch of the family, Arla Bravo, lives in a rickety but grand home on the banks of an intracoastal waterway with her daughter Sophia who is about forty. There are four other Bravos, two absen. Arla's absent husband simply walked out one day never to be heard from until twenty years later. One of her sons, Will, died tragically and the other two sons live near by with an ongoing love/hate relationship. The family now faces the possibility of great wealth. But does money make life better? That's the overwhelming question that moves the plot forward. If you love strong and fascinating characters, a setting that you can almost smell and see with a plot that is simple and moves the story forward at a perfect pace for the beautiful land outside of St. Augustine, you should read this book. I've hesitated to write about it as I struggle with the how to communicate how much I loved it. The characters, even those you may think you do not like, have great complexity. When you think you do not like one, you find that they're very human, never flat or simple."}, {"userName": "Candace", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1629175-candace", "userReview": "Heart of PalmUtina, Florida, is a small, raggedy town off the beaten path of any of the state\u2019s real estate booms\u2014so far. I\u2019m using that old school \u201cbeaten path\u201d expression in place of the more modern-ish \u201cradar\u201d because Utina is not the sort of place where people know from radar, but they definitely do know about tangled, root-rich, overgrown paths leading to the Intercostal Waterway. The Bravo family owns the town\u2019s bar and grill\u2014the only one\u2014which is run by the good-hearted Frank, who stayed in town with his eccentric mother and erratic sister, while his brother Carson married the woman Frank loves and moved to St. Augustine.Laura Lee Smith\u2019s first novel is a story of people and place, both of which are rendered in affectionate, believable detail. This is not to say that this is a sweet story; it has plenty of depth and plenty of bite. The Bravos are faced with an opportunity that would secure their futures but destroy their town. They are certainly Quixotic, but Carson is also desperate for cash and Frank would like to move somewhere cooler. Termite-riddled Aberdeen, the family home, is being held together by rampant vines and is so crammed with junk that it just might be impossible to ever clear out. What will they choose? The answer will surprise you.Heart of Palm is a lovely read. Smith manages to create characters who spark even in the sweaty atmosphere of Utina. She has published a number of short pieces and she has expanded into the novelist\u2019s realm with grace and ease. I think we can look forward to an ongoing exploration of the hearts and minds of a state so many people visit, but so few people actually know."}, {"userName": "Jai Francy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23377575-jai-francy", "userReview": "When there is just enough (money, luck, talent, etc., etc,etc,) to get by, one tends not to take chances or stray very far from what\u2019s familiar.

The Bravo family is generations of depleted resources, abject poverty, and a whole lotta dysfunction. Lifetimes of being from the wrong side of town might just turn out to be being in the perfect location at the perfect time with the growth of the Florida intercostal waterways.Heart of Palm is a complex novel in that there are a number of developed plots and subplots with hot sweaty twists and turns making this novel full of emotional scenes and unexpected drama at every turn. The characters are as flawed as you and I, possessing transparent hearts and that southern sense of humor.Laura Lee Smith\u2019s debut novel is impressively flawless and heartfelt.

The book looks like a sappy romance novel, but it still interested me because it was about the part of Florida that you have to look really hard to find these days. I have been a Floridian for 42 years and I have seen in grow from small town beauty to city upon crowded city. Beyond that the book had a great plot line about a very dysfunctional family with lots of twists and turns. The characters all had a likable quality and most also had a hard to like side. A great book about a Florida that seems to be lost forever in the midst of Disney, South Beach, and the sprawling megalopolis of South Florida...gave me a little twinge of \"remember when...\"Ps. Had many references to Florida Gator football-gotta love that!"}, {"userName": "Beverly", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3685151-beverly", "userReview": "Heart of Palm  was the perfect book to bring on a Florida vacation. It's 450 pages and I tore through it once I got going. Before I left I did a search for books set in FL, looking beyond the usual suspects. Once you read Swamplandia you are drenched with a sense of place reflecting the old FL clashing with the new. A great book.This one was was not GREAT but it was damn good IF you are interested in the area north of St. Augustine on the Atlantic, the small town lives being lived between the destination spots us New Englanders crave once winter sets in, and admire an author who manages to write about ordinary people being pressed by extraordinary circumstances.The Bravo (!) family is well known in this forgotten town where jobs are few and hopes are minimal. For generations they've not been exactly model citizens. In the mid-Sixties one Bravo boy falls for a local city girl in St. Augustine. She's walking along the highway all tall and regal. Dean Bravo falls instantly in lust/love. Arla comes from a well off family, but is not close to her parents who are not close to each other. Instead of going to college, she gets married. To Dean. Not a good idea. In the prologue their honeymoon turns into a disaster that never really ends. The novel shifts to the present in the numbered chapters and there are scads of characters to follow. Arla has had four children who are now grown and mostly screwed up. Frank is the most solid character in the book who yearns for a different place. The one time his family took a vacation when they were kids to the mountains outside of Asheville, NC he fell in love with the magic of watching fireworks above the clouds. His own northern lights, his dream place. But the Bravos are known as troubled and trouble makers. Well deserved in their teenage years, yet still being treated with suspicion.Their father, Dean, left the family 20 years earlier and somehow The New Bravos have managed to carve a sliver of a life out of what they have: a run down house called Aberdeen, an eldest sister who is OCD, Carson who has 'made it' in St. Augustine after marrying a local girl. He's a jerk. Frank runs the family bar and restaurant called Uncle Henry's, and a younger brother met a tragic end when the boys were in their teens. Other townspeople make up the rest of the cast until their land on the Intracoastal interests real estate honchos 'out of Atlanta.' Should they sell? Should they take the vintage 'kit cat clock' that is mentioned with great frequency throughout the novel as time passes (although the author keeps referring to it as a 'Felix' clock). It's not.The author juggles events, flashbacks, and decisions in unexpected ways. This unpredictability of what would/could happen next moved along at a languid but rich pace. The writing was good, clear, and thoughtful. It was published in 2013. So many books, so little time, but this one might be worth your time when you want to settle in to something that won't end in a hurry. It reflects the slow moving South with its heat, its contrasts, and the venerable set up of a love/hate relationship with where one comes from. \"...the three of them sitting together, somehow, with something that might have been love but was different--harder, tighter, stronger, even, than love. It wasn't love, in fact. It was family.\" (page 399)"}, {"userName": "P.C.

The development all over Florida forgot this sleepy little village until one day it becomes apparent that this gem of a location might be the perfect spot for a new resort.The mother of the Bravo tribe, Arla, came from the upper crust of St. Augustine society when she married the hapless Dean. A typical story, except that Arla is anything but typical, and her relationship with her husband is anything but a love story after the first forays of lust in the heady days of a Florida summer.The family defines the overused concept of dysfunctional. Arla's son Frank holds the family together the best he can while pining for the love of his life who just happens to be married to his brother Carson. It's a messy pile of sand spurs on a desolate beach of missed chances and tragic accidents.Just when the story falls into the Pat Conroy fold of family heartbreak and insanity, a developer happens along to perk up heads and hold out hands.I loved the pace of the story and enjoyed getting to know the characters created by Smith. She knows north Florida and expresses her passion for Florida, although I would have enjoyed a bit more description of the landscape. That's just my personal preference, especially when the setting is Florida between the Intercoastal and the Atlantic Ocean.The title puzzled me, until I thought about it. The inner core of certain palms is called the heart of palm, and it is removed to create a tasty salad. At least I thought it was tasty, until I found out in some species of palms its removal results in death of the whole tree. The author doesn't make this obvious, and I only figured it out because of my knowledge of heart of palm salad. The title Heart of Palm is well suited for the plot.It's sometimes difficult to write reviews with thorough explanations without using a spoiler. Therefore, I will simply say that the ending was not as satisfying as the rest of the novel. All in all, it's a good romp through the sea oats and marsh grasses of north Florida and a grand visit with a southern family at its zaniest best."}, {"userName": "Patty", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2281353-patty", "userReview": "Heart Of PalmByLaura Lee SmithMy \"in a nutshell\" summary...Family issues in a little town in Florida are exacerbated by realtors who are clamoring for three hot properties.My thoughts after reading this book...The Bravos...odd, unusual, surrounded by trouble...this is the family at the heart of this novel.

If I had gone by that alone, I probably would not have chosen the book because it sounds like just another romance, but the description drew me in.But this Southern saga of the Bravo family is so much more than a romance, even though there is some of that involved, and even though the first few pages made it seem just another romance.You just don't want to get mixed up with those fellas. Just ask Arla, who fell in love with Dean when she was just a teenager.I loved the characters in this book. They had depth and originality and a great deal of heart. Arla, whose life didn't turn out at all as she expected. Dean, her charismatic husband, and the first Bravo we meet. Frank, who just tried to hold things together. Carson, who was so easy to dislike. Sweet, damaged Sophia. And a cast of others who made me care about them. Biaggio, whose whole existence was due to spite. And even Drusilla, only a headstone hidden in the palmettos, but a good friend to Arla.Of course, there is a tragedy. There has to be a tragedy other than just the everyday waste of so many lives.This is a sweet, wonderful book, bittersweet like the best chocolate, and a lovely summer read.I was given an advance reader's copy of this book for review, for which I am grateful."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3594188-kate", "userReview": "I have a suspicion that the publicists missed the mark when promoting Laura Lee Smith\u2019s Heart of Palm.

The other end are the books that exhibit their southernness like a caricature. These are the often hysterical books that showcase the oddities that are often go hand in hand with life in the south. Heart of Palm sat wonderfully in the middle. There was oddness, for sure, but it was a quiet oddness that I could relate to.

The matriarch, Alma Bolton Bravo, was raised in a well-to-do family and never wanted for anything. Alma decided as a teenager that she wanted to be different, so she chose to marry a man that was as different from her family as she could find, Dean Bravo. The first tragedy in their lives occurred on their honeymoon, when Alma is in a boating accident that causes the amputation of her toes and splits her foot. Of course it doesn't help that the cause of the accident was Dean's refusal to have a third party as a spotter to go out with them so Alma could water-ski safely. Years pass, Alma and Dean have four children and are barely making ends meet and the second tragedy occurs with the death of their youngest child. As the years pass, it is evident that their eldest, Sofia has mental health issues (she was diagnosed as manic-depressive with OCD). Dean, a heavy drinker, winds up deserting the family shortly after the death of their youngest child. Alma makes do and eventually buys out her brother-in-law's business, a local bar and grill. Carson Bravo, the eldest son, marries and moves away from home and starts his own business. Frank Bravo, the youngest son, still lives in Utina and runs the restaurant, a job he's had since he was nineteen years old. Sofia lives at home with her mother and helps her brother out by cleaning the restaurant every morning. On the surface it appears that the Bravo family is just a family dealing with the usual family issues and dysfunctions, but the Bravos are dealing with more than tragedy, heartache and mental health issues. Frank is in love with his sister-in-law and wants to move away from Utina and live a quiet life. He knows this won't happen as long as his mother and sister are around and need him. Carson has made a mess of both his marriage and his business and needs to find a quick fix for both before he winds up divorced, in prison or worse. Sofia struggles with her mental health issues, but she is surviving and has found love for the first time in her life at age forty-three. Alma, as the matriarch, worries about her children but knows that she can no longer control them. The family is offered the chance to make a large sum of money and leave Utina behind, something they think about or say they want until the opportunity is presented to them. Ms. Smith has captured the essence of family in all its dysfunction in Heart of Palm. As I read, I was reminded of the line from Tolstoy's Anna Karenina: \"All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\" The Bravos are unhappy in their own special way. There aren't any true bad guys in Heart of Palm, as each Bravo family member deals with their own secrets and guilt. Dean and Alma aren't the best parents, but they did what they could for their family to the best of their abilities. Sofia, Carson and Frank aren't loving siblings but they are there for one another when needed. Carson's wife Elizabeth, and daughter Bell, add their own idiosyncrasies to the family. Sofia's love interest, Biaggio, works with and for the Bravo family and he considers himself a family member even before he and Sofia decide to marry. Heart of Palm is filled with angst, drama, greed, guilt, pain, suffering, forgiveness, and love . . . all the things that make a family a family. If you're looking for a well-written story about family and small-town living, then I strongly recommend Heart of Palm."}, {"userName": "Jeff", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5569397-jeff", "userReview": "***WON VIA \"GOODREADS GIVEAWAYS\"***Many books claim to be reminiscent of  Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe , but this small-town novel fits the bill.

The characters are so well developed, quirky, and troubled. The storytelling is compelling with descriptions that have you smelling and feeling and touching and hearing everything. Some paragraphs and sentences were just so good, I had to reread them and let them swirl around in my head a bit. I wish I still led a book club so we could talk about this book. There is just so much here\u2014like what about the church linens? The foot? The dog? And let\u2019s just talk about Dean for a while. Or any of the characters for that matter. I will be reading more by this author."}, {"userName": "Iman", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5581597-iman", "userReview": "Well, that was an unexpected gem. I blame Sarah Dessen and Nicholas Sparks for instilling my formative reading years with a love for small town family dramas. It's a big reason why this book felt a little like coming home."}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1851930-lori", "userReview": "What a delightful surprise. Someone at local bookstore suggested this because it's set in area where we live. The setting is integral to the plot but the book is so much more. Really enjoyed time with the Bravo family as dysfunctional as they are. Loved this book."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16937753-michelle", "userReview": "Excellent book. Great character development and I loved the local flare."}], "description": "Utina, Florida, is a small, down-at-heels southern town. Once enlivened by the trade in Palm Sunday palms and moonshine, Utina hasn\u2019t seen economic growth in decades, and no family is more emblematic of the local reality than the Bravos. Deserted by the patriarch years ago, the Bravos are held together in equal measure by love, unspoken blame, and tenuously brokered truces.The story opens on a sweltering July day, as Frank Bravo, dutiful middle son, is awakened by a distress call. Frank dreams of escaping to cool mountain rivers, but he\u2019s only made it ten minutes from the family restaurant he manages every day and the decrepit, Spanish-moss-draped house he was raised in, and where his strong-willed mother and spitfire sister\u2014both towering redheads, equally matched in stubbornness\u2014are fighting another battle royale. Little do any of them know that Utina is about to meet the tide of development that has already engulfed the rest of Northeast Florida. When opportunity knocks, tempers ignite, secrets are unearthed, and each of the Bravos is forced to confront the tragedies of their shared past.Reminiscent of Kaye Gibbons, Lee Smith, Anne Tyler, and Fannie Flagg, Heart of Palm introduces Laura Lee Smith as a captivating new voice in American fiction.", "title": "Heart of Palm", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16129257-heart-of-palm", "average": 3.85, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1369869947l/16129257.jpg", "reviews": 161, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3912697.Laura_Lee_Smith", "name": "Laura Lee Smith"}], "type": ["Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16129257-heart-of-palm", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18886816-heart-of-palm", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34496926-the-ice-house", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7952787-new-stories-from-the-south-2010", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23719209-the-best-american-short-stories-2015", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/156391.Natural_Writer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
