I think my mind is still sleeping after reading 45 chapters of Mr. Mogul. If I had a time machine I would go back and close the book as soon as I saw it was 45 chapters. The concept was great. The main heroine was great, the hero promising, the delivery...not so much. Actually the hero was probably great but 42 chapters of pointless background fluff kind of made him forgettable. I kept reading thinking it was going to get better but after reading 20 breakfast scenes, I should have just given up. I like details but sometimes there is such a thing as too much detail. And pointless friends. And detailing those pointless friends. And then to top it off the book ends in a happily for now type of cliffhanger which tells the reader to read more about them in the next book. OMG no no no. I can't take anymore continuation series. Is it too much to ask for a standalone HEA? This book would be a five star if someone takes a pair of scissors and cuts out the boring fluff and just concentrates on Andy and William."}, {"userName": "Allie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30024685-allie", "userReview": "I'm confused...

From the start, I had a hard to getting into it. Firstly, I don't understand why he was so mean from the beginning and continued it. Second, the chick had a big chip on her shoulder I wish she could have lighten up more. Thirdly, for me, the book needed to be edited. I felt it could have been easier to read if the sentences were condensed and didn't repeat the same thing one after the other. Lastly, the ending just threw me, why does it need to be another book?

Rarely do I hate a book enough to DNF it. (Usually it's just a lack of motivation.)But whoa. This book is spectacularly unrealistic. Not to mention as boring as watching a snail crawl a mile. My main problems with this book are:1- The main character. Whatever her name was is supposed to be an older twenty-something year-old / thirty year old, but she acts so unprofessional. She is always late to work, whines about everything, and worst-- is rude to her boss. (Well, technically not her boss- but his goddamn SISTER is her boss, so she should at least be careful around him.)\" \u2026shook my head in disbelief and got out of the room before things got weirder for me. As I finally took myself out of the current situation I was in, I recounted on what I just did today. First, I had a make-out session with the man I thought I loathed and then I slapped him \u201caccidentally.\u201d Also, I rudely asked him to get out of my father\u2019s hospital room, where he clearly overstepped a boundary. And now, I\u2019m taking the responsibility of taking care of him because he is both sick and drunk and he is my boss\u2019s brother. I didn\u2019t know it would take a day to make life shift so quickly. And I almost forgot, I think I just flirted with him. Yeah, because agreeing to sleep with him is a form of flirting. I felt the stupidity of my actions. Why do I feel so attuned to his presence? Do I really hate him in the first place? And I did admit to Terry that I had a thing for him. What is happening to me?\"Just no. But, technically, in her defense (which she does not deserve), the main hero is pretty uncooperative too. I guess. He doesn't really have a personality besides the generic Mr. I-am-the-hottest-piece-of-ass-around-and-also-pretty-rich stereotype.

And I did!Their love is definitely NOT an insta love which is refreshing, especially for the heroine. Go Andy!! Yeah, I kinda bored with heroine insta love for the hero and we have to wait for oh-too-long time before the hero realize his feeling towards the heroine. I can feel the desperate feeling of Mr. Mogul who fall for an ordinary girl. Keep and keep searching for her shadow everywhere she's around. super cute khekhekheeeee *EvilGrin*What lack in this novel is the intimation which I can say, almost nothing. But the tension, hm...sexual tension, especially from Mr. Mogul was so thick. I really like that. Not a lame heroine, yeah, Andy? You go, gurl!! And the plot really simple, yet sweet, even I cant say it was super sweet. But yeah, average sweet. And kinda unrealistic. Yeah, what kind of Mr. Mogul who have the time for fooling around for a girl who doesn't want him? hello, He has all the money in the world but no time?! Unrealistic, see?

As some of you may already be aware I am not a huge fan of contemporary and usually I prefer fantasy or classics. Despite this, I did really enjoy the story. Its light-hearted nature and simple story line made the book easy to read and follow throughout. The characters, although a little clich\u00e9, were likeable, especially Andy whose personality seemed very life-like and relatable. I also liked the relationships within the novel \u2013 unlike other contemporary books I have read, the relationships depicted were not overly cheesy and felt very real (although I wasn\u2019t too keen on the nickname \u201cpeanut\u201d). Despite this, there were aspects of the novel that made it a little predictable and, in parts, boring. It took me very little time to become invested in the storyline and the main characters, but I found the middle of the novel to be incredibly slow and repetitive. By the middle of the novel, I had worked out what would happen in the end but the author seemed to deliberately to add unnecessary twists and turns to the plot that added no new suspense or tension \u2013 how many times can one guy be knocked back? Although I was very interested in what the outcome would be, I felt that the story lacked momentum in some parts and thus made it a bit boring.

I mean, if it were up to me, I'd have no problem with attending to work. But, William's persistence to command Andy is just too humorous. She's so feisty and that is a good trait in a character in a novel, wishing that most realistic people would love to be. She takes crap from no one and doesn't let the biggest billionaire interfere with her job. This story left me with the feels and I wouldn't mind reading it again through paperback.
