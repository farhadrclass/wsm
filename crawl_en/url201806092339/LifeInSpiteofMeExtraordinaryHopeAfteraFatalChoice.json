Kristen wrote honestly with tenderness that not only shares her story, but touches you in whatever place you are in right now. I greatly appreciated the openness and the vulnerability with which Kristen shared her story.The book was well written and presented the hard truth in a kind manner. Kristen and Tricia created a book that draws attention and then focuses it onto the Lord. The story along with the \"personal letters\" at the end of each chapter make this an amazingly encouraging read and I would highly suggest it to anyone struggling with their life.* * * * *This review copy was provided courtesy of WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing."}, {"userName": "Karan Gupta", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24693210-karan-gupta", "userReview": "It is always inspiring to see or rather read about someone turning the table on pain and suffering. Kudos to the author for finding happiness and meaning despite a self inflicted trauma - from which not many people can usually bounce back. Despite being moved by her resilience, I was a tad bit disappointed by her over the top preaching about the urgent need for people to believe and adopt Christianity. I am a strong believer that everyone needs to put their faith on something that makes us take a leap of faith when faced with a path breaking challenge. I also believe that miracles do happen. But I don't believe that adopting a certain sect of religion can be the answer to get rid of suffering. To each his own - and at the end of the day as long as we are hopeful and believe in god (whichever version), we will always have the strength to do the impossible."}, {"userName": "Rori Rischak", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4843278-rori-rischak", "userReview": "I was disappointed by this book. I read the beginning of it on Amazon's Look Inside feature, and the beginning of the book completely sucks you in. I mean, you're reading about being run over by a train from the perspective of a girl who really was run over in a train, and it's an incredible thing to read.I also think it was an excellent idea to start the book off describing the suicide attempt and the trip to the hospital, and then provide the background story (i.e., the events leading up to the suicide) a bit later in the book. Unfortunately, while the book started out strong, it didn't hold its momentum. The middle of the book is basically a story of your typical angsty teenager facing surging emotions and making bad decisions. But it's still better than the last part of the book.The last part felt rather impersonal and almost like bragging. It was something akin to \"I spoke at my baptism, and people were so inspired that I started talking at the youth group and neighboring churches, and they were so inspired I started speaking all over the country, and I eventually got so famous that Oprah wanted to speak to me and I got interviewed there.\" For all that she claims she inspired people, I was left sadly uninspired by her story.Her main message of inspiration was that God loves you and he has a plan for you. How does she know this (and yes, she specifically uses the word \"know\")? Because a pastor told her. Okay, in all fairness, I should confess that I'm not a practicing Christian, but I'm reading a book from a Christian perspective. Why? Because even though I'm not religious, I have read some books from a Christian perspective that I've found inspiration from. I read Life Without Limits a year or two ago, and that was quite possibly my favorite book I've ever read. Even though I'm not Christian, the things he said, his suggestions on how to approach your life, made sense from a basic human perspective. I read Blue Like Jazz: Nonreligious Thoughts on Christian Spirituality, and the author had a lot of interesting things to say that got the wheels turning in my own brain. Even though I didn't come to the same conclusions, he really made me examine how I wanted to live my life.So I was hoping to glean some similar inspiration from this book, but unfortunately, Kristen strikes me as less of an intellectual follower of Christianity and more of a blind follower."}, {"userName": "Blessedmomfxs", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4832228-blessedmomfxs", "userReview": "Struggling with depression, Kristen Anderson acted impulsively. Depression coupled with impulsivity is often lethal. It could have been so for Kristen\u2026but she didn\u2019t die. She just lost both of her legs. She thought she had problems before that winter night. Waking up in intensive care, she wishes her suicide attempt had succeeded. Friends and family tell her, \u201cYou\u2019re alive for a reason.\u201d She struggles to find how that can be the case.Kristen gets professional help, goes on anti-depressants and chooses to harness her strong will to overcome her newfound disability. Still, it just isn\u2019t enough. She becomes a Christian. She still struggles. Slowly, and by His grace, she comes to realize that she does have a purpose and that she indeed is alive for a reason. Through her growing faith and personal relationship with Christ, Kristen finds the strength to be victorious over depression.Kristen\u2019s is a powerful testimony to the healing power of God. Moreover, it is a strikingly well-written look into the mind of a depressed teenager. Kristen came from an intact, loving family. They attended church together. She was a good student. She had friends and parents that cared about her. Somehow she still felt that she was a failure and a disappointment. Depression is an ugly disease. It truly distorts one\u2019s view of the world, their circumstances and their worth. It steals hope. In Christ, there is hope and healing\u2026even for depression.http://blessedmomfxs.wordpress.com/20..."}, {"userName": "Dustin Crazy little brown owl", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2454496-dustin-crazy-little-brown-owl", "userReview": "I received this book through the goodreads first reads giveaway program. After receiving my free book, I realized it was a Christian Ministry book - the religious overtones did not bother me until the second half of the book. My copy arrived in hardcover - which was a nice surprise. I read the dust jacket flap and was hooked right away - unfortunately the first half of the book interested me more than the second half. The second half is more about Kristen finding a new life in Christ than the attempted suicide issue. Here are a few examples of how the religious tone annoyed me:Kristen goes to church and a stranger approaches:\"It's a good thing your suicide attempt didn't work,\" she said. \"You would have gone to hell if you'd died.\"-Chapter 13, A New Reality\"Gratitude filled my heart. I was grateful that I'd lost my legs. That, more than anything else, had brought me to ChristWhat if it had never happened? I shuddered, thinking of where I could be. Losing my legs showed me how big and real God is. For the first time I realized losing my legs was worth it. I wouldn't go back, even if I could.\"-Chapter 21, Overwhelming Gratitude\"Urge anyone expressing suicidal thoughts to get professional help from a doctor or counselor - preferably a Christian counselor.\"-ResourcesAnother pet peeve in the Resources section, Kristen keeps going back and forth between including males in her advice. She writes \"listen to him or her\" and then two sentences later writes: \"If she says that she hates her life, she can't handle it anymore, she hates herself, she wants to commit suicide, she wants to die, or something similar, believe her words. And if she won't tell you with her words but is telling you with her actions, listen to and believe those.\"Following all these her and she directives, \"he\" is included in the next sentence.With that said, The first half of the book is 5 star material - the story draws readers in immediately. It's interesting to see how Kristen adjusts to life in a wheelchair - how she faces the obstacles of stairs and narrow doorways. As the book opened, Kristen's story brought back memories of how deaths of grandmothers, relatives and friends affected my life growing up. An emotional story of finding personal meaning in life.The following lyrics appropriately accompany Kristen's story:\"I can see clearly now.... It's going to be a bright, bright, bright, bright sunshiny day.\" - Jimmy Cliff\"There's a light in me, that shines brightly. They can try, but they can't take that away from me.\" - Mariah Careyand finally, Amazing Grace Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,That saved a wretch like me.I once was lost, but now am found.Was blind, but now I see.Favorite quotes:\"It hurt to care.\"-Chapter 3, Carefree No More\"Around us, in all directions, were headstones of others who had died. They'd lived their lives, and all it came to was a name on the headstone.\"-Chapter 4, What's Wrong with This World?\"Their intentions were good, but I wondered why people had waited so long to tell me. If they really believe I'm special - and that God has a special plan for my life - why didn't they tell me before? Why did they wait until I'm lying in a hospital bed to tell me how much they love me, how much God loves me? I had needed to hear that just as much in the past as I did now.\"-Chapter 9, Kind Words and New Questions"}, {"userName": "Courtney", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2500729-courtney", "userReview": "Disclosure: I received a free ebook copy of 'Life, In Spite of Me' by Kristen Jane Anderson fromBlogging for Books in return for my review. All opinions are 100% my own!We've all been hurt. We've all been depressed at one point or another. Have you ever felt like ending your life, though? In 2007 I was diagnosed with a chronic pain condition at the age of 17. I was severely depressed because I knew I was going to have it for the rest of my life. Did I feel like ending my life? Honestly, at one point yes. Thank God my dear mom did everything in her power to get me the help, mentally and physically, that I needed.When I read Life, In Spite of Me by Kristen Jane Anderson I felt her pain. I understand completely what she was going through, except for the fact that three of her friends had died along with her grandmother in two year and mine was a physical pain that caused me to be depressed.After still dealing with the four deaths, she was raped by a person she thought she could trust. After all the emotional and physical pain she went through, on a January night, at age 17 she decided to lay down on train tracks and wait for the train to come and run over her and end her pain and suffering.But she did not die.At the young age of 17, Kristen became a double amputee. God apparently had other plans for her and she survived being run over. Going through her recovery and new life as am amputee is purely amazing. I absolutely love how Kristen did not hold back. She was honest, even if the details were grimm.The part I love is when Kristen finds God. It was such an amazing part of a book, and definitely one I could connect with her on. Since losing my mom in May (actually exactly 4 months ago today), I found God. Through something terrible happening, both to me and Kristen, we both found love in God.I definitely recommend this book, 100%. Especially anyone contemplating suicide. Kristen doesn't glamorize suicide once, which is the way it should be. Everyone deserves hope when they think they'll never have any again. Kristen is good at doing that. Life is a precious thing and things will get better, no matter how far down you feel you are.After reading this book I did a Google search on Kristen Jane Anderson and found that she has created a non-profit ministry called Reaching You Ministries. You can find out more about Kristen and the ministry by visiting the website and Facebook!"}, {"userName": "Keiki Hendrix", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1790150-keiki-hendrix", "userReview": "\"\u201cIf you have a teenager, if you remember your teenage years and all the sad angst that went with it, if you want to read of the redeeming work of your Savior in a young girls life, read this book.\u201dDepression and suicide are powerful deceptions of the enemy to lure those with the most potential, our youth, away from the gracious love of God. In Life, In Spite of Me, Kristen Jane Anderson tells of her struggle with these oppression thoughts and feelings and how it drove her to think it best to end her life.As I read about the events that led up to this 17-year-old girl\u2019s decision to end her life, I was captivated. Suffering the loss of several friends and her grandmother in the span of two years plus a sexual attack at such a young age, Kristen reveals her thoughts, her desperation, and her loss of hope.But God.Yes the story is tragic and the events described are almost unbearable to read especially from a first person stance, but the power of God to cleanse, restore and instill vision in this young life far outweigh the devastating events.CS Lewis once said \u201cThe real problem is not why some pious, humble, believing people suffer, but why some do not.\u201d I\u2019ve come to believe that even though the person afflicted does not understand (as Job did) what is happening to them or why, there is always purpose in pain for a child of God. This, plus the knowledge of James 1:3 brings meaning and comfort.If you would peek inside the mind of a suffering teenager, if you would care to know what they truly believe, think and feel \u2013 read this book. You will be moved by this story. God\u2019s stories are always moving. Use Kristen\u2019s story to offer hope and a witness to those suffering around you.I recommend this book highly and suggest it be read by all youth or young adult ministry workers.Disclaimer:The review copy of this book was provided free of charge by the authors representative and was donated to the Youth Ministry of Westwood Baptist Church."}, {"userName": "Barb", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/913393-barb", "userReview": "How could you not give this book 5 stars just for the simple fact that it was amazing about everything God did in Kristen's life? Kristen was depressed, and I believe the suicide from her best friend Brandon made her go over the edge to try to commit her own suicide. Lying on the railroad tracks and after 33 frieght cars severed both of her legs she should have been dead. But, God had bigger and better plans for Kristen. Her work wasn't done here on earth. She had yet alot of people to help and tell her story to. I felt like after reading Kristen's story the song Amazing Grace has greater meaning to me than it ever did. I have never tried to commit suicide but I know a couple of people who had. I can only go by my own story where I was in an abusive relationship but somehow God always shows us the way to come out of it and helps us along the way, steering us in the direction he wants us to take. Whether we take it or not is up to us. God gave each one of us the ability to make our own decisions, we can only hope those decisions will draw us closer to God. A powerful story and I am glad Kristen has told it to so many people and that it's making a difference in their lives.

It also is a Christian ministry book, and that alone will put off a lot of people also. I like that she was faulty and struggled with her behavior and faith after she came to Christ, it made me relate in a big way.

The author was 17-year-old Kristen Anderson, a suicide attempt statistic. I finished it in one day --after picking it up at the Ohio State Fair . I could not put it down. In 2002 Kristen lay down on railroad tracks in from of a moving freight train, hoping to end her life. But unlike many people who attempt suicide and die, Kristen survived...but her legs were severed. Today in 2015 she's now a 30 year old wheelchair bound motivational speaker who runs a counseling business to help at risk teens.\"Right before it got there, I made the impulsive decision to lay down on the tracks. I wanted the pain to end. I just wanted it to be over,\" remembers Kristen. \"33 freight train cars went over me at 55 miles per hour.  She had been grounded by her strict loving parents, and had sneaked out to spend time with a friend that cold winter night. Rather than returning home to angry parents, Kristen impusivley decided to end her life. But somehow, someway, her attempt didn\u2019t work. \"When it was going over me, I felt pain, but more than anything I felt a tremendous weight or wind pushing me down. When it stopped, I opened my eyes and I started to look around to figure out if I was dead or alive.\"I looked behind on my right and about ten feet behind me on my right, I saw my legs. And I knew they were my legs because I had these new bright, white tennis shoes on them that I had just gotten for Christmas, and it just seemed unreal to me. It seemed like it was a horrible nightmare.\" Kristen thought her life was a horrible nightmare. This smart, popular, successful girl's world started falling apart. Her grandmother died. She lost four of her friends\u2014one had a brain tumor, two died in a car accident, and one hanged himself in a cemetery. Her parents were on her about her drinking and smoking. Last straw, she was raped by a \u201cfriend\u201d at a party\u2014and so ashamed to tell anyone she kept it inside. Two weeks after the \u201cincident\u201d he called and threatened her if she went to the police. So she told no one. She became more and more introverted. Deeply depressed and suicidal. After that night on the train track, life was even worse. She was in the hospital for three months. Doctors tried to re-attach her legs, but they were unsuccessful. After a number of surgeries, Kristen was confined to a wheelchair for the rest of her life. \"I just started to cry out to God and for the first time, I asked Him why He would keep me here, why He would want me, even without my legs,\" she says. Part of her was mad she hadn\u2019t died on the train track. But in the back of her mind, she was a little glad she didn\u2019t. She had questions about what happens when you die. This search sent Kristen searching for for the truth. She\u2019d grown up in the church, but God always seemed far-off. The concept of a \u201cpersonal relationship with Jesus\u201d and a loving God was totally foreign to her. Then a friend of Kristen\u2019s showed her God\u2019s Word. And that explained everything.\"Kristen started attending church on a regular basis \u2013 and helping with both the high school and young adult groups. She enrolled in Moody Bible School and then started Reaching You Ministries. That\u2019s where she works today. Her goal is to keep people from the deep despair that can sometimes lead to suicide. Kristen Anderson says that a train took her legs, but God gave her a new life... anyone who feels like giving up like she once did can talk to her. I rather skim read the last part of the book. It was a bit braggy, and not as interesting. She made statements like \"I spoke at my baptism, and people were so inspired that I started talking at the youth group and neighboring churches, and they were so inspired I started speaking all over the country, and I eventually got so famous that Oprah wanted to speak to me and I got interviewed there.\" Still all in all...a good book especially for teenagers."}, {"userName": "Jimmy Reagan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7635021-jimmy-reagan", "userReview": "Do you need encouraged?

She should never have lived (that\u2019s no exaggeration as the book proves), but she did. Listen to her story and finally see the hand of God become clear.I had never heard her story until my wife, a paraplegic herself, had been reading about Ms. Anderson and was fascinated by it. That intrigued me, but I began reading thinking I would decide for myself. I did and it was a page turner!When you read the advertisements that this book is a tool for suicide prevention, don\u2019t assume that is all the book is about. Yes, every person contemplating suicide needs this book. Beyond that, though, every person fighting depression, or even a round of discouragement, will find this volume a rallying cry to not give up. Actually, if all you are looking for is a story of the mighty power of God on a life, grab this book. It reads easy and holds your attention throughout.What makes this book work? Ms. Anderson doesn\u2019t hold back. No matter how unpleasant the detail, if it is needed to tell her story, she tells it. Depression, partying, all the things that added to the darkness she went through are given in all the gory details. At the same time, dark things are never glamorized. She tells us what she thought and felt each step of the way.Adjusting to her new found disability was shown in a clear way that as one who watched his wife adjust, I could relate. I thought that part was especially well done. Then, there was guilt. It haunted her through everything and we find where she found victory. Even with counseling and dealing with prescription drug issues we are let into her life. Failures, setbacks, and finally success are laid bare.The point where she found Christ was an emotional high in the book where you felt like cheering. Later, when her loving mother did the same, you find yourself excited again. Finally, there\u2019s the lesson she learned\u2013a loving God saved her on a train track so He could save her soul later. A lady with so much sadness became a lady filled with love and gratitude. Ms. Anderson, thank you for sharing your story that clearly can help so many.I received this book free from the publisher.

I got a bit choked up several times, especially at the scene that described Kristen's baptism, because of how much her newly-changed life positively affected her family. This book was well-written and courageous. I loved the parts that read like a novel, such as when she remembered the past events leading up to the night she laid on the tracks. I also loved how detailed the story was regarding the aftermath and healing that took place once her legs were gone. Sometimes people don't realize how good things are until they no longer have them...like being able to walk. Life looks completely different from a wheelchair. This book showed that very well.I admire this author for laying her heart out there for people to see. I really love the way Kristen is using her painful past and healing journey to inspire others. I understood her testimony regarding no longer needing anti-depressants, but I also have concerns about people with true clinical depression reading this and thinking that they, too, can stop taking their medication. I cringe to think of people trying it without seeking help from a professional, which Kristen thankfully did in her story. I'm glad she mentioned that she didn't do it alone. Some people truly do need medication for life...even Christians who love Jesus. Also, the fatal choice wording in the title is technically not true. It should be near-fatal choice, because she is clearly not dead. I am grateful for that, or this book wouldn't exist. God clearly saved her life for a divine purpose.

If any of these things has happened to you or you're struggling with depression, then this book will bring you hope and show you how Anderson found the way to joy.The memoir was written \"in her head as it happened\" rather than in a \"looking back\" style, which created a tension that kept me turning the pages. The book was a fast read and was written in an easy-to-read way. The book began with the gripping re-telling of her attempted suicide, then she told about the events leading up to the attempt, and then about her hard recovery and journey to joy and purpose in God.It truly is an amazing story. I'd highly recommend this book, especially to people who struggle with depression or wonder if life will ever get any better.This book was provided for review by the WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2698688-jennifer", "userReview": "From My Blog...[return][return]Grab a box of tissues prior to settling in to read Life In Spite of Me by Kristen Jane Anderson and Tricia Goyer. Kristen was a healthy active 17-year-old with a loving family when a series of events beyond her control began to cascade down upon her making her feel no longer in control, no longer worthy, tired, and longing to go to Heaven. Life In Spite of Me speaks openly and candidly to the reader about Kristen's experience, her thoughts on the evening she decided to end her life, the immediate hospitalization afterwards, and a flash back to what brought her to that terrible day by the train tracks and the rocky road to her physical, mental, emotional and spiritual recovery. Interspersed throughout the book are notes written by Kristen, speaking directly to the reader trying to reach out to those who despair, to let the reader know she understands as others do and it will be alright, but one must talk about their feelings and seek help. Life In Spite of Me is an extraordinary book about an amazing teenager who faced what many of us thankfully never shall, who overcame the obstacles and who grew to become a better person through her struggles and now reaches out to help others.

For some of us, this can include self-injury or even suicide. Most of us do not go that final step, due to a good support system, the Lord graciously preventing it, or some other such reason. Some of us *DO* go through with some horrible action, however, and then the consequences are felt by all.Kristen Anderson attempted suicide after months of emotional anguish. First her grandmother died, then a close friend killed himself. As if this was not enough for such a young one to handle, she was raped. She began to feel weak, worthless, as if it was her fault what happened, like life is a never-ending crapshoot that never gets better. One day, she decided that if she ever were to kill herself, she would have a train do it.This temptation was powerful for one so gripped by depression, fear, and hopelessness. One day at the park, she simply gave into the urge, the desire to \"end all the pain\", and she laid down on the tracks in front of an oncoing train. The train rolled over her, and she looked over to see her legs away from her. She had SURVIVED!! Later on, she found out that she had lost eight pints of blood. She should have died after losing a maximum of five pints. As an aside, I was a medic in the Army, and I can say that this is true. She medically should have gone into hypovolemic shock, and died.She did not.After she was released from the hospital, she was shocked when a woman told her that the woman was thankful she did not die in the accident, or she would have gone to Hell. Kristen was stunned. How dare the woman such a thing to her! She began to wonder if it was true though. She had been struggling still with depression and now it was worse, as she wondered about this. What *would* have happened? She realized after a talk with a trusted individual that she *would have* gone to Hell, because she had not accepted Christ as Savior. A short time later, the angels in Heaven rejoiced over her accepting God's gift of eternal life.It would be nice to say that she had no more trials, but she did, but the Lord got her through them all. The rest you can learn about by reading the book.The book is fantastic! I simply can not think of enough praises for it. Having given her life over to the Lord, she is very honest and forthcoming, in order to help others. She has a ministry to help those who, like me and others, struggle with these issues. I admit I do as well, and I appreciate her honesty.The only caveat that I have, and this is a big one, is her attitude towards psychiatry. Or rather her *perceived* attitude towards psychiatry. She realized that the doctors were not right about some of her diagnoses. Her counselor realized this as well. Part of her problem is that she had no consistent psychiatrist for very long. I am thankful and proud of her, that she got off the meds, because her depression was temporary, and no lasting causes were to blame. I know that if she heard my story and others, she would understand that we should not view our meds as a sign of weakness. However, I KNOW that in my cogent, non-spiraling out of control moments. At my less than ideal moments, I think I and others, *could* make the mistake of misinterpreting her as saying such a thing, so we may stop meds we need, or not start them if we need to do so. I have read from other Christians on this topic of depression, and they *always* make the distinction between those who are over medicated, and those who are truly diagnosed correctly, and thus need the medications, as is the case with some people.Miss Anderson does not make this distinction, so I must caution people that if they buy this book for one who is struggling with mental illness, please make the distinction yourself. I believe she simply didn't think of this concern, even though she would agree with these other authors and myself. That is the ONLY reason her book is not receiving a perfect rating from me. It is a phenomenal book, and if you want an inspiring story, want to help those who suffer, or are suffering yourself, I recommend it. Please just understand the one weak point, and do NOT view your meds as a weakness. I don't believe she would say they were either. I just wish she had included the distinction.-----I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishers via their BloggingforBooks program.

The first chapter, titled \"Just let me die,\" brings us to the night that Kristen decided to kill herself... and for each page that you must turn because you want to know her story, there is an overwhelming weight of fear and dread for what is about to happen.Kristen did not die that night. She survived, but lost both of her legs. All at the age of 17. Who can even begin to imagine her physical, emotional and mental pain? Your heart weeps for her. But Kristen is destined for something more.As a mother of two daughters, I was so struck by Kristen's story. Kristen tells us that her life was perfect when she was a child at 7, but as she matured--she became increasingly depressed with the pain the world had to offer. Whether it was seeing the homeless, losing a loved one, having a friend commit suicide, or being raped--she spiraled into a place overwhelmed by regret, guilt and darkness. She did not see a way out, and decided to end her life.But she did not end her life. She survived. And she struggled. Depression continued to haunt her, and at deeper levels now that she was without her legs. She shares with us what people would say to her when they came to the hospital-- \"Everything will work out... God kept you here for a reason, Kristen.\" But Kristen is puzzled by these comments. She states:\"If they really believe I'm special--and that God has a special plan for my life--why didn't they tell me before? Why did they wait until I'm lying in a hospital bed to tell me how much they love me, how much God loves me? I had needed to hear that just as much in the past as I did now.\"But God did have something special planned for Kristen. She turned toward God and gave her life to him.. and in doing that, she began \"walking straight out of my depression and into the arms of God.\" With the help of strong Christian friends, counselors and a solid supportive church, Kristen turned to God who helped her conquer her depression and wean herself off of all her medications.Then Kristen began telling her story--sharing it with others privately and publicly. And in telling her story, Kristen realized why God had truly kept her safe and alive underneath that train. People approached her in public and emailed her, telling her that she saved their life--people who had contemplated suicide themselves--people who had given up on God. These were the people who were moved by her story, and changed by her testimony.Kristen says it best herself:\"The story I had once been ashamed to tell was now giving people extraordinary hope. Only God could do that. My story helped save another person's life--only because God had first saved mine. Life, in spite of me.\"Kristen now speaks around the country, telling her incredible story--and has established Reaching You Ministries in order to help those who are lost, depressed, and struggling with suicidal thoughts. She is truly an inspiration.Read this book. Then buy one to share. Kristen speaks her own language--she tells her own story--she is so compassionate and forth-coming. A teenager can read this and think she is talking just to them--but an adult can feel the same. And what other message is more important? God gives us life, in spite of ourselves...As a final note--there are notes in this book from Kristen to the reader--such encouragement and honesty. And the book closes with an incredibly moving afterword from Kristen's mother.The best way to end this review is to close with the passage that Kristen uses on her Reaching You Ministries webpage:He reached down from heaven and rescued me;he drew me out of deep waters.He led me to a place of safety;he rescued me because he delights in me.~Psalm 18: 16, 19 This is an important book--thank you Kristen for courageously sharing your story.I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review. http://wendyalton.blogspot.com/2011/1..."}, {"userName": "Orbs n Rings", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4694420-orbs-n-rings", "userReview": "A heart wrenching memoir of a teens struggle with depression, a failed crippling suicide and her struggle to attain a personal relationship with God.A mix of emotions swam over me as I read this real life memoir of Kristen's life. A taboo subject for many Depression seems to eat away at our society while doctors look to treat it with medication, as if there is no other available option. I learned a lot from this book even though I have struggled with depression myself throughout my lifetime, due to undiagnosed ADHD. I could relate to Kristen as she struggled to get off her anti-depressants feeling they were doing nothing for her but numbing her emotions and encasing her thoughts in a fog day after day. The survival of Kristen after her trauma is a true miracle that will inspire you whether you have struggled with depression yourself or with a family member.I believe every teen should have a copy of this book. We as everyday parents can so easily miss the signs if our child is struggling with depression, as many have. Kristen shares inspirational prayers and thoughts at the end of each chapter which touched my heart. Raised a Catholic like Kristen I have always felt there was something more to this life and my relationship with God than I was taught during my childhood while attending Catholic church and Catholic school. Some of us go on throughout our lifetime attending a church for years because that is where our parents took us and feel empty as adults. One main reason why later as an adult I turned away from attending church services. However I have always kept my belief and relationship with God throughout my lifetime. Like any other person, I have at times thought I pulled away from God out of anger or disappointment, later to find out those were the times when he carried me, due to my unstable state of mind. This is touched upon in Life In Spite of Me by Kristen could not remember the moments before her suicide attempt, those last few moments leading up to it. The lowest point for someone suffering from depression is the point when a persons rational mind is shut down. It is as if a demon has taken full control of this persons thoughts and feelings. After Kristen awoke and was conscious she was tormented by the thought that if she had died, would she have ended up in hell. This is something the Catholic religion, among others has taught followers for centuries. Kristen got her answer from a family friend, however I totally did not agree with his belief. I don't believe if someone dies before accepting or even knowing God whether by an accident or suicide they automatically end up in hell, if there evn is one, but that's another topic. If this was so then heaven would be a very empty place. Why would our loving God punish someone for not being in their right mind or having a mental disorder that caused their death. With this in mind If Kristen's book saves even a handful of lives, provides comfort for lost souls, and instills in them a belief in God whether they are believers or not, she has cultivated a perpetual garden, that is just beginning to sprout, because God has much more planned for Kristen than she can ever imagine."}, {"userName": "Kristin", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/575523-kristin", "userReview": "While I didn't realize it when I picked up this book, I felt that it was written with the teenage/early adult female in mind, which, based on the subject matter, is the right target artist. At 17, Kristen Anderson finds her life at a crossroads just after New Year's, and takes a walk around her neighborhood, ending up at a park near some train tracks. Feeling like she has no one to turn to after a recent fight with her parents and the loss of some close friends, Anderson throws herself in front of an oncoming train.In what can only be attributed to God's will, Anderson survives being run over by 35 train cars, but loses both of her legs as a result. Much of the book deals with Anderson's efforts to come to terms with the decision she made and the decision God made. As happens with many victims of trauma, Anderson had no memory of the incident and whether it was an accident or a suicide attempt but realizes that if it truly was a suicide attempt, she would not have gone to heaven had she died and her chances to get in still were pretty slim. She also continues to battle the issues that led her to the train tracks that day, in addition to the new issues that being an amputee brings.What brings Anderson to write the book and tell the story of that fateful day is her renewed faith in God and that He has a plan for everyone if we are willing to give of ourselves completely to Him. During her recovery, Anderson seeks out individuals who could help her answer the lingering questions about whether she could still get into heaven. When their answer is that she needs to get closer to The Lord, she begins attending a local church and finds both purpose for her life and peers who, had they been in her life as a teenager, may have been able to lift her from the despair she was feeling. While she continues to face challenges such as trying to find prosthetic legs that fit well enough to allow her to walk again, and being nearly broke as so many adults are after their undergraduate eduction, Anderson also knows that God has kept her here to minister to other young women who battle the same feelings she faced and He will take care of her if she allows.I would certainly recommend this book to girls and young women who feel that they have nowhere to turn and are contemplating suicide. Anderson includes personal notes written to them, to provide encouragement and alternatives, as well as warning signs for parents and loved ones to tell if someone is on the edge. While I am a Christian and a believer in God, I have not completely given myself to Him, so I don't know that this book had the effect on me as it would on someone who has or is in a vulnerable position, ready to open themself up to His word, but I did enjoy the book."}, {"userName": "Andrew", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4259638-andrew", "userReview": "Life, In Spite of Me Extraordinary Hope After a Fatal Choice by Kristen Jane Anderson was a story about having hope in God always. Kristen went through a dark tunnel in her life and she made a dramatic choice that forever changed our entire life and the lives of the people around her. Kristen was determined that she had no place in life and that there was no hope for her. Kristen was run over by a long freight train and the doctors didn\u2019t know how she survived the impact. Kristen tells the whole story about what lead her to lay down on the railroad tracks and why she tried to commit suicide. Kristen shares how to overcome depression and she explains in her book about how much God loves you. God can use anybody who will continue to let him. I love the book and it has helped me to overcome depression in my own life. The book has helped me realize that God loves me. The book has taught me that what his word says about me is what is most important. We have all been placed on this Earth of a reason. God is always with us through whatever we have to endure and encounter if our lifetime on Earth. God is the one who holds the future we don\u2019t. We can\u2019t change our past but God is always there for us. Kristen also adds encouragement notes throughout the book to let you know you are not alone in your struggles in life. God was with her and he still is! God is also with you! You are never alone! One of the things, I adore is how Kristen has started a ministry called \u201cReaching You Ministries\u201d. On her ministry\u2019s official website, she allows people to email trained counselors if they are struggling with depression and they need someone to talk to.

Unbelievably, after thirty-three freight cars ran over her, she was still alive \u2013 but missing her legs. Thus began a completely new part of her life. It was hailed as a miracle that she survived and Kristen's recovery was slow and painful. Only after her suicide attempt did Kristen come to know Jesus on a personal level. In Him, she found a reason to hope, to live, and to walk.Life, In Spite of Me by Kristen Jane Anderson with Tricia Goyer is not a book I would want to read every year, but it is well worth reading at least once every few years. Despite the heavy topics it deals with, the book was a quick read. Kristen's experiences are related gently and authentically to the reader. However, I think the book and its readers could have benefited from having more information about Kristen's healing from the sexual assualt in addition to the details she gives of her physical healing and struggles with depression. I felt like most of her issues prior to the suicide attempt were consolidated under the blanket of depression and only mentioned occasionnally after the suicide attempt. I found this book to be very encouraging as I personnally struggle with depression. I appreciated that the author boldly, but kindly declares the need to know Jesus as a personal Savior. Truly, her relationship with Jesus not only saved her soul and brought healing, but also enabled her to reach out to others struggling with the same issues. I think this book could help anyone who is dealing with depression or who knows someone dealing with depression. The encouragement notes directly from Kristen were especially kind.

After being raped, experiencing the deaths of several friends, and dealing with family problems, Kristen had reached the end of hope. One night she decided to end it all. But God had other plans.

Kristen tells her story and shares the source of hope in the midst of life's struggles. Life, In Spite of Me is an amazing book that offers hope and challenges readers to see how miraculously God works. When I first picked up this book, I didn't quite know what to expect. Plenty of people have attempted suicide, but Kristen's story is unique. The more I read, the more I found myself standing in awe of the God who restores all things. This book is written very well--especially for a auto-biography. Of course, Tricia Goyer, who helped Kristen with this book, is an excellent writer, and I honestly wouldn't expect anything less than the quality of writing shown in this story. It's so much more than that, though. This book is written in a way that makes it easy to engage in. It's as though we are feeling the emotions with Kristen. I'm not just reading her story, I'm experiencing each step with her, needing to know what will happen next, feeling the tension in critical decisions. I shed so many tears while reading this story. Tears of sorrow, tears of joy, and tears of praise. They really should include a package of tissues with this book.We live in a world where depression is increasing. With the economy at its lowest and with jobs decreasing, people are feeling the loss of hope. Kristen's story offers encouragement and shows us that God continues to pursue those who have no hope, and fill them with life. I truly recommend Life, In Spite of Me.

Not really any one thing contributed to this depression, but she'd been fighting with her parents, three friends had died as well as her grandmother, she had been raped, and the previous night she'd been out until ten in the morning with friends. She was grounded until further notice. She sneaked out to be with friends, left a note saying she was going to take a walk, and later was in a park. She decided to sit on a train car and think. As she heard a train approach, she decided she would end her life. She planned for the train to hit her and she assumed death would come instantly. Instead, she survived, but her legs were cut from her body.This book is the story of her journey to live as well as learning to live with her limitations. Not having legs meant that she was confined to a wheelchair for a while. She had to do exercises to strengthen her arms so she could even get herself to and from the wheelchair. This book points out things that are harder for the handicapped to do -- some doorways are too small to get through, steps are a problem in private homes, and even reaching into the cupboard for a glass can be impossible for someone in a wheelchair!A fascinating story that I could not put down, Life In Spite of Me was a book that is honest about struggles but also shows how she found faith in God. This book can't be summarized in a short book review, because the details are what creates such a great read. The day to day concerns of everything from financial to the pain of the latest surgery to finding a new medicine that works better, those are what makes this book such an excellent read. It's not her story -- it's her journey. Eventually Kristen decides to go to Bible college. She tells her story when asked, and eventually lands on Oprah! This is an amazing book, and one I highly recommend. Although it is about the tough issue of suicide, it is skillfully written and focuses on living a life of faith after a tragic event as well as giving hope to those who are depressed."}], "description": "She wanted to die.
