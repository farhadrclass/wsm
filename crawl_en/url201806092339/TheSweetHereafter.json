Banks answers: when it is for the common good.Writing-wise, there is nothing special in this book. The prose is simple, readable and sometimes even boring. There are a few meaningful verses but none that can be gleamed as original or hits you really hard. However, what's lacking in verse is adequately augmented by the thought-provoking questions that this book opens to the reader and in the end, offers answers as well.When is an accident an accident? If the criminal is well-liked, does the community have the right not to push charges? Do lawyers really mean it when they say that \"you have to file a case because it can also happen to other people\" or they are just after their commission? If you made a wrong choice in marrying someone, do you have the right to commit adultery? If you are a sex abuse victim, do you have the right to remain silent? How do you comfort yourself if you caused the death of many people especially if they are innocent children? This is a story of a quiet, laid-back town in Upstate New York. One January morning, a school bus tumbled down in a sandpit full of cold icy water. Aboard the school bus were 44 schoolchildren. Fourteen of those at the back, wearing their seat belts, drowned. The driver, Dolores Driscoll, a late middle-age black woman survives. Among those children who also survived was Nichole Burnell  and she was just sitting right at the back of Dolores and she now claims that she was looking at the speedometer when the accident happened.The story is told my 4 narrators: (1) Dolores Driscoll tells what happened in that tragic morning including the family background of the 14 dead schoolchildren; (2) Billy Ansel, an ex-Vietnam soldier who is currently running an auto repair. He is a single father of twins who also perished in the accident. He was driving his pickup following the school bus quite closely but he was daydreaming about having sex with one of the victim's mother who he is having an illicit affair with; (3) Mitchell Stephens is the New York negligence lawyer. He is one of the many lawyers who rushed out to the town in order to convince the families of the victims to file mass lawsuit; and (4) Nicole Burnell who is a local teenage beauty. She survives the accident but her lower body becomes paralyzed. According to Wiki, Banks based this on a true story that happened in Alton, Texas in 1989. A Coca-Cola truck hit a Mission school bus. 21 schoolchildren drowned and 49 were injured. The families of the victims filed a mass lawsuit due to the instigation of the many different lawyers. \"Many think that the money received from the lawsuits only brought the town trouble,\" Wiki ends.Easy to read. I finished this in one day. Yet the many moral questions that the book leaves the reader will stay and linger in one's mind for many years to come.

The awful tragedy in itself is not committed to the page, but the aftereffects are clear, the emotions are not hinted at but fully disclosed. I don't know if I was very much convinced that there are four DISTINCT characters, since they are so alike. I feel like a great bulk of the book was not told, not actually given to us the way it was supposed to: like evading a grand central question. Yeah, there is relief that there was no courtroom scene (the sole detriment to a classic like Native Son for instance), and that we were spared a gruesome scene of a multiple accidental infanticide. But where is the gamble? \"The Sweet Hereafter\" is so preoccupied with the entire township that when the reader's & the individual narrator's ethics are questioned, the collective thought wins out & everything becomes impersonal. I think this was a very difficult book to put together, though the approach of penetrating a group emotion by seeing the world through one of the four protagonist's mind seems a tad ineffective as it tries to be personal."}, {"userName": "Tfitoby", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5454475-tfitoby", "userReview": "A remarkable and remarkably simple piece of literature that spawned a remarkable movie.Russell Banks, Russell Banks, Russell Banks. If I write his name enough it might conjure a complete sentence from my mind, as though his name alone might rub some of his magic off on me and I could explain this novel to you. Russell Banks. It's not working. I just read Affliction which a truly incredible movie was adapted from, adapted so well that it seemed to make the novel a non-event for me, yet I knew that Banks had something special, a skill, a voice that could create something wonderful from mere words on paper and being completely unsatisfied I plunged straight in to his other novel that was adapted in to an award winning movie, naturally. It could have been a mistake but I believe my decision was vindicated by just how urgently I devoured this one.Told in five parts in the first person by four of the major characters in the aftermath of the tragic crash of a school bus Banks slowly creates a multi-layered understanding of the event and the way people cope with tragedy. To tell you much more than that would be to act as a spoiler and I'd hate to ruin this for you. The four people you meet are Dolores the bus driver, Billy a bereaved parent, Mitchell the big city lawyer and Nichole a child survivor. It's loosely based on true events, a school bus did crash in Texas in the late 1980s and the townsfolk went crazy with litigation.I have seen and enjoyed the Atom Egoyan movie several times and never found it lacking in anything but in this instance the novel really does add an extra power and understanding to the film. From the opening paragraph as we meet Dolores I was hooked, the distinct voice of this chatterbox shone through loud and clear and she is the perfect set of eyes and ears to learn about the tragedy that will unfold and be retold in the following 250 pages. The distinct voice of Dolores is then added to by three more quite distinct characters and this is apparent from the opening paragraphs of each subsequent section. The most important literary trick that Banks pulls off in this novel is that at no point are you confused over which character is narrating which section AND on top of that you are led towards sympathising with each of the characters despite their conflicting emotions and intentions with a subtlety that cinema will always struggle to match.There's only one reason for the lack of full marks in this case and that was the disappointing final section, it felt like an unnecessary addition to the story and a way to moralise at the reader rather than let them take from the story what they will. I don't like being told the answer to these problems by an author and to have one attempt to do so simply highlights the conceit of the literary fiction writer.But don't let that stop you from reading this book or seeing the movie, both are splendid and worth your time."}, {"userName": "Bill", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/810550-bill", "userReview": "[At the end of the novel, Delores, having spent over a year carrying guilt over the accident, comes to the realization that the entire town believes the lie that solely blames her for the accident.

Trott", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/157583-j-trott", "userReview": "I first read Russell Banks because I found out that he wrote the books that two great movies are based on, \"The Sweet Hereafter\" and \"Affliction.\" The first of these two is an exquisite movie. In fact, and one doesn't often hear this, especially on Goodreads, but the movie is better than the book. In the movie, directed by Atom Egoyan, the story of a school bus in a upstate NY town going into the lake is dealt with in the aftermath. Most of the children of the town are dead, and lawyers show up, talking about lawsuits. The folktale, \"The Pied Piper of Hamlin\" is interwoven through this story. At the end, one does not see the folktale as a metaphor, providing one to one correspondence with the characters in the story. Instead, the possible allegorical meanings of the folktale are switched, until the folktale remains as an interpretive schema, the reverberations it provides are about the sadness of losing children, and the fierceness of those who are angry for justice. Dolores Driscoll, the bus driver, is the Pied Piper. She drove the bus that took the children to the sweet hereafter, a place she feels she herself has reached, though she survived the accident. The lawyer from the big city is the Pied Piper of Hamlin, he promises to solve a problem for the people of the town, and also, like the Piper, he is angry. His only daughter is a heroin addict who keeps hitting him up, and he keeps paying her. Billy Ansel, the one guy in town who stands up against the idea of tearing apart the town with lawsuits, is a leader. He is also destroyed after losing his own two children. Then Nicole, the only other survivor, in a wheel chair is the criple kid who never made it into the happy land in the hole of the mountain. She is alone, without any friends. The shots of the snow covered hillsides and the stanzas of the Pied Piper create a haunting tale about the loss of children and the impossibility of encompassing these losses. It is not a moral tale, though it resonates as a true one. The book is good. The story is the same as the movie. It deals with sexual abuse, a topic that I have seen Banks deal with before. It is a topic that we do not deal with enough in our culture. Banks has four different narrators. There are passages where the prose rivals the title for poesy. Dolores Driscoll explains her relationship with her wheel chair bound husband, which is in the movie word for word, is one place like this. Another is when Billy Ansel, having lost his wife and twin children, makes an honest calculation of what is left and finds that he has nothing left to live for. The folktale gave the movie a bit of hope, though it is a dark one. The ending of that story, in which the children end up in a happy place, while the town is bereft always seems a little suspicious. Isn't this just what we tell ourselves to make it okay, to make this awful story palatable for children? But there is no Pied Piper in the book, and all the main characters do not have the glib answers that faith provides. The children are gone. The hereafter is sweet precisely because it is after here, and here is punctured by loss."}, {"userName": "Joseph", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/375171-joseph", "userReview": "Whenever I read this book, I find myself wishing I'd read it before seeing the movie. No matter how hard I try, I find that I just can't shake those visuals, and I'd like to try to read the book on its own terms.Having said that, I love both the book and the movie, for reasons I'm not sure I can explain. The movie was actually one of the first DVDs I ever bought, at a time when DVDs were still kind of magical, and I watched it backwards and forwards. I listened to the commentary tracks; I watched the documentaries. Nowadays, who has time for that kind of investment in a flimsy plastic disc?But the book. Four different narrators, each distinct and fully realized. The back of the book describes it as a \"morality play,\" but the book lacks the obviousness suggested by such a label. Morality, of course, is an issue in the book, but it's not presented in stark right-or-wrong terms. My judgements of each of the characters changes with each read. Is Mitchell Stephens a crusader or a lawyer? Is Nicholl courageous or naive? Is Billy capable of seeing the world clearly, or are his decisions invalidated by the grief which has destroyed him?All in all, it's a lovely book, translated into an equally lovely movie. I can't recommend either highly enough, and I wish I could find the eloquence to explain why."}, {"userName": "Tory", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41751-tory", "userReview": "This one seemed to have a lot of potential.

I read it many years ago, but it affected me deeply at the time. After I saw the film (which is one of those rare adaptations that may almost eclipse the novel), I read the book and could not stop thinking about either for days. I had the book group I was running at the time read it - mostly moms and grandmas, they hated it. The novel asks, what happens to you when the worst thing in the world, something that seems unimaginable to you, becomes your reality? Are you compelled to pinpoint, quantify and assign blame? What does that do to you? Does it help you or hurt you? Does it help or harm a community? While the \"worst thing in the world\" in the novel differs in some significant ways from the unimaginable in Newtown, I still think this book may be timely reading for anyone currently contemplating those types of questions."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2208262-elizabeth", "userReview": "The goodreads blurb for this says: \"Atom Egoyan's Oscar-nominated The Sweet Hereafter is a good movie, remarkably faithful to the spirit of Russell Banks's novel of the same name, but Banks's book is twice as good.\" It has been a while since I read the book or saw the movie, but I'd say this assessment is kind of backwards. Banks's book is good, but the movie is a masterpiece.

This book reminded me of the movie \"Crash\" --- it had that same feel of being a moving and at times heart squashing view of different people's lives and the way they come together to misunderstand each other. At the same time, it's very different than Crash because the central conflict or story is this bus accident and how people grapple with it. The writing was good, and at times the words were profound and very insightful. On the whole, I liked the book and I'm glad I read it. I wouldn't read it again and I recommend it with reservation (plenty of swearing and gritty material). At the same time, I wish I could discuss it with someone.SPOILER ALERT:So the dust jacket says the following: \"This is a large-hearted novel whose telling is, despite all, often warm and humorous and ends in a remarkably orchestrated redemption.\"The best thing I can say about the book is that the characters are so real. The four people who tell the story are very different from each other. Delores, the bus driver, I loved. The lawyer I liked too- though his angry attitude and vocation (ultra aggressive litigation lawyer) disturbed me. He was disturbing, but also very intelligent, at times entertaining, and so understandable throughout. The other two narrators I could take or leave, but the sexual details of Billy's affair and Nichole being molested- those I could've done without. I think it's interesting that modern adult literature considers itself more honest if it talks about sex. Certainly, it can play a big role in some stories, especially ones with romance, but it this one it seemed to be a gritty accessory rather than something necessary. Maybe, after a couple centuries of people feeling they couldn't mention words like \"erection\" in literature, maybe now we're going to the other extreme in an effort to compensate.To me, the story doesn't have much redemption at the end. The end was sort of a \"I'll be my own individual and not give a #$%! about what other people think\" resolution. Individualism is all good and fine, and in the book the bus driver's moment of clarity that she exists independent of the others is beautiful to read, but I suppose I was hoping for the redemption and resolution of the community--- yes, one girl lying and saying that the bus driver was speeding saved the community from years of lawsuits, yes, it was satisfying to see that the lawyer didn't get to nail someone's head to the wall just to satisfy his anger (never realizing that he was tearing apart a community to do it).But what about the big lie, incriminating the bus driver that everyone had initially felt was as much a victim as the dead and crippled children? When she left her home town and community at the end of the book, it didn't seem like she was running away from prejudice, she was leaving because she felt she didn't belong- but she didn't belong anywhere- she and the children in the bus accident were \"solitaries living in a sweet hereafter\u2026 absolutely alone\u2026 and even [their] shared aloneness did not modify the simple fact of it.\"The other parents we saw intimately- their lives more or less fell apart after they lost their children. And the town- the community- it comes together in the closing scene of the book- but it comes together in a fickle way, making me feel that community isn't worth much at all if it can act with such callousness and then be so transient in its opinions and feelings.So, for me as a reader, this was not a story of redemption.

Dolores Driscoll, a straightforward woman who is the breadwinner & caretaker of her husband, was driving the school bus when it went over the cliff. Billy Ansel, a respected Vietnam veteran, local businessman, and father of two, is driving behind the bus as he waves goodbye to his children inside. Mitchell Stevens is a lawyer from New York City who comes up to try to \"help\" the parents of the town sue the \"people with the deep pockets\", in some twisted attempt to sort out his anger at life, and at having an estranged addict daughter. Lastly, Nichole Burnell is a teenage survivor of the crash, and also a survivor of sexual abuse by her father who uses her deposition (or lack thereof) to exact revenge. It is fascinating how everyone describes each other, and how their own self-portrayals are often so very at odds with their \"public\" faces. There is a movie based on this novel, and both are very good. However, the movie is set in Canada, while the book has local appeal. The best part of the movie, aside from the enchanting flute-heavy soundtrack, is the pied piper framework which is totally absent in the book. But the book also has a lot going for it--the depth that narration provides, and the surprising climax. I didn't expect it at all (because it was completely different form the movie, which I watched first), but the ending takes place with Dolores once again narrating, as she did at the beginning of the novel. Almost a year has passed, and she and her husband have laid low since the accident. They decide to rejoin town life at the summer county fair, at the demolition derby. The description of the derby was gripping, and the flavor was so real and true to upstate New York, and it really brought the book together. One thing that really bugged me was the...quality of narration, I guess you would call it? It was almost like some weird middle ground between the formality of the written word and the casualness of the spoken word, and in some places it was totally distracting & didn't work for me. And Mitchell Stephen's addict daughter is a completely unbelievable character for me. She was unbelievable in the movie, and she was unbelievable in the book, with much of the same forced dialogue. These are the reason I can only give it two, maybe two and a half stars."}, {"userName": "Buggy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3099666-buggy", "userReview": "This book blew me away with its beautiful writing, many layers of story and the credible tension that Russell Banks was able to create out of such a simple premise, in fact it almost reads like a mystery. Banks writes in such a way that he opens up the small town of Sam Dent and deposits you right in the middle of it leaving you feeling as if you personally know all the characters or might have once lived there yourself. It is also an interesting character study and from my experience realistic in the way each person here deals differently with grief; Some self-destruct while others find new strength, all want to lay blame somewhere and everyone in this once innocent town is irreversibly changed. Banks manages to show all sides of these ordinary characters, even the negative and because this was written from 4 different perspectives almost anyone will be able to find a piece of themselves in one of them. Ultimately it will leave you looking at yourself and those around you differently because every town has its secrets. As I said the story is simple; One snowy morning a school bus goes off the road and into the frozen waters of a small American town, 14 children are lost in the accident and its citizens are confronted with life's most disturbing question when the worst happens who do you blame and how do you cope? We then enter surviving school bus driver Deloris Driscoll's head as she recalls the morning of the accident and introduces us to the town and its members while making stops along the bus route. We then switch to widower and war veteran Billy Ansel who is following the bus on his way to work, his story is heartbreaking and full of secrets. The narration then turns to New York lawyer and pariah Mitchell Stevens who has come to Sam Dent like all the other lawyers and media to try and make a buck off the tragedy, surprisingly I really enjoyed his view as you can`t always judge a book (lawyer) by its cover. We also hear form 14 year old Nicole Burnell, who before the accident was a cheerleader and the town princess and is now confined to a wheelchair, her part in the story shocked me.

It reminded me of \"Seven Types of Ambiguity\" with its multiple unreliable narrators. I was impressed with many things about this book. First, I thought the author really captured the \"voices\" of his different narrators in a very authentic way -- they were really all different people, as opposed to books like \"My Sister's Keeper\" where they all sounded the same. Second, I was particularly impressed with the chapter that was written from the point of view of the ambulance chasing lawyer. The author actually made you second-guess whether an ambulance chaser could possibly have a morally upright, or at least sympathetic, motive. He did a wonderful job of making the ambulance chasing lawyer both sleazy and sympathetic, a truly complex character, as opposed to being all one or the other, or worse, unrealistically switching between the two.

It tells us nothing comforting. There are no heroes. And yet, as stark and heavy handed as that sounds, Banks makes it interesting. He gets us through each section, through the stories of four narrators, linked to a school bus accident in a small town, by painting the details of this familiar life with subtlety and skill. Each of these narrators has come to terms with themselves in one way or another, and even Nichole Burnell, the most seemingly pure character in the book, when she speaks the truth, speaks it vindictively.There are mysteries here too, the almost mystical quality of a small dreary town functioning as one moody beast."}, {"userName": "Joanie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5676172-joanie", "userReview": "In his attempt to write a philosophical novel, Russell Banks sacrifices character development, plot and engaging writing.

As even a brief look through my reviews will show you, my reading spreads out very far afield indeed, and I enjoy pretty much every type of fiction as well as quite a lot of non-fiction. Still, the kind of fiction that I love the most, that is closest to my heart, is literary fiction; and there are reasons for that which go beyond personal preference. (And, another disclaimer, I\u2019m of course well aware that there are exceptions, that there is genre fiction which is just as deep and ambitious and formally daring as the best of literary fiction. But those are just that: exceptions. (And, disclaimer inside a disclaimer, there is of course literary fiction that plain sucks, and this is not the exception at all. I\u2019m not concerning myself with bad books here, however.)) What distinguishes good literary from most genre fiction is that the former has a layering of meaning, a surplus of significance which the majority of the latter lacks. You can trace this even in fairly conventional realistic fiction, if it is well made like, let\u2019s say, Russell Banks\u2019 comparatively slim novel The Sweet Hereafter.So let\u2019s take a look at it. After the disclaimers, a warning: It is impossible to make the point I want to make without mentioning details of the plot, so there will be spoilers.The Sweet Hereafter takes place entirely in a small American town in Upstate New York. It is told in five parts by four different narrators, each of which has his or her own, very distinctive voice \u2013 something that Russell Banks handles very well here: The language that the narrators use does not only serves to tell them apart but also contributes to their characterization and to clarifying their relation to the novel\u2019s central event, a school bus accident in which several children have died. The bus driver\u2019s style is chatty as she attempts to distract herself from the terrible moment when she caused the bus to swerve off the road; the voice of the father who lost two children is detached and matter-of-fact as he is still under shock from which he will possibly never recover; the voice of the lawyer who persuades several of the bereft parents into a compensation lawsuit feels like a court address as he battles with the feelings of guilt nagging at him and attempts to justify himself; and the voice of the girl who survived the accident with her legs paralyzed is defiant as she not only copes with her disability but even tries to draw strength and confidence from it.On its most obvious level, The Sweet Hereafter is a novel about greed and what it does to a community; it shows how an unscrupulous lawyer exploits the loss of grieving parents, and how those parents are only too willing to give in to his seduction (on this level, the lawyer does come across like something of a snake oil merchant and I think there may be reminiscences of Melville\u2019s Confidence Man). The town community is close to breaking apart, and it is only when the parents and the lawyer are forced to relinquish the lawsuit that the town is finally healed. From this perspective, the novel tells a story of redemption and even is, in spite of the tragedy at its heart, quite uplifting in its overall effect.That on its own would have made for a nice, if possibly somewhat forgettable novel, but there is more to The Sweet Hereafter than that. On another level \u2013 a level that is both more general and more individual \u2013 it is a novel about the way a single, unforeseen event can rupture apparently settled lives. The event itself \u2013 the bus accident \u2013 is never directly represented, it is a void, a lacuna that sharply divides everything into a Before and an After. It is probably from this level that the novel\u2019s stems, insofar as the disruptive force of the event is such that even the survivors and the bereaved parents have been touched by death and passed into a different existence, have in some way died themselves. Of course, their hereafter is not particularly sweet, so the title is highly ironic, but even so the romanticisation it denotates marks one way to cope with the catastrophic event. And the novel traces many ways to deal with the disruption the event has caused, not only for its point of view characters but for the whole town; the lawsuit which was at the centre of the first layer becoming just one coping strategy among many on this level. And the ending, viewed from this perspective, is far more ambiguous \u2013 while some people do manage to cope with the desaster and its consequences, some are destroyed by it, and it is quite clear that everyone will be bearing its scars. Even Nichole (the surving school girl), who appears to have become a stronger person after surviving the accident has paid for this with the loss of use of her legs, while others sink ever deeper into lethargy and alcoholism.The Sweet Hereafter, however, is still not done yet, and there is another layer of meaning to be unearthed if one digs just a little deeper, and this layer is mainly concerned with perception. Or more precisely, with the unreliability of perception which is a theme that runs through the whole novel from start to finish, starting with the bus accident itself, which was caused by the driver seeing something on the road which was not there \u2013 or maybe it was, we never really find out and remain as much in the dark about it as the bus driver herself. The bereaved father is unable to view the women he was having an affair with the same way as he did before, she has stopped being desirable for him. When the lawyer persuades the parents of the dead children to file a lawsuit he does so by shifting their perception, first by turning their tragedy into a source of possible profit, second by putting the blame for the accident on an instution that would be able to pay compensation. And Nicole has been sexually abused by her father for years, but none of the grown-ups has noticed, or wanted to notice. This thematic cluster culminates when Nicole places her deposition and lies about what she has seen \u2013 but although she lies about having actually seen the speed at which the bus was going, she may very well be right about it, as only the bus driver is contradicting her and she is not exactly reliable herself (and not even quite certain about what she has seen, either). So Nichole may be telling the truth even as she is lying, which of course is precisely what novels do \u2013 we might see a metafictional twist hidden there, if we were so inclined.One could probably find more, if one kept looking hard enough for it, but I think I made my point. It is a bit like Zeno\u2019s paradox, the one about Achilles and the turtle \u2013 just as Achilles is unable to catch up with the turtle even as their distance shrinks towards the infinitesimally small, there always remains a residue of unresolved significance in a work of literary fiction, a surplus of meaning which may grow smaller and smaller with each repeated reading but never disappears completely and always promises more things to discover."}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/605445-nicole", "userReview": "This book was my introduction to Banks; it was the right book at the right time. In terms of POV and plotting, there is so much here. He examines a town's tragedy from different angles, taking his time. His characters are well fleshed-out; it was interesting when they made assertions that directly came into conflict with the belief of another character. (For example, the bus driver was so proud of both her care of the bus, and also the attention she took while driving. Then in the next chapter, a character has a different take on her skills with the bus, and brings his own issues to that comment, in a way that feels so human.) The chapters are long and expansive, with tangents, but all of it takes us deeper into the world of this small town and the impacts of the tragedy. Now, I have to go search and see whether Banks has spoken in an interview about his plotting technique; it is intricate, and effective. I loved the honesty and compassion and depth here."}, {"userName": "Nathan Leslie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8095844-nathan-leslie", "userReview": "A modern masterpiece.

Except that his tongue came out and licked dry lips. Then I recognized it: I\u2019ve seen it a hundred times, but it still surprises and scares me. It\u2019s the opaque black-glass look of a man who recently learned of the death of his child. It\u2019s the face of a person who\u2019s gone to the other side of life and is no longer even looking back at us. It always has the same history, that look: at the moment of the child\u2019s dying, the man follows his child into darkness, like he\u2019s making a last attempt to save it; then, in panic, to be sure that he himself has not died as well, the man turns momentarily back toward us, maybe he even laughs then or says something weird, for he sees only darkness there, too; and how he has returned to where his child first disappeared, fixing onto one of the bright apparitions that linger here. It\u2019s not a pretty look; it\u2019s downright spooky\u201d (p. 102).Out of context, this paragraph may not sound like much. In context, it can ruin your day \u2026 give you nightmares \u2026 take with it the last peaceful evening you\u2019ve ever spent \u2026 if you\u2019re now a parent.If you\u2019re not, I\u2019m not sure. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t mean much.I haven\u2019t read anything like \nThe Sweet Hereafter\n since John Fowles\u2019s The Collector, back in the sixties \u2013 which could well say more about me as a reader of current literature than about Russell Banks as a writer of the same. In any case, I\u2019ll risk saying that this novel is sui generis. Four distinct voices; and all four, authentic (at least to this reader\u2019s eyes and ears). Quite an accomplishment \u2013 and something very few writers (once again, in my limited experience) know how to do well.Apart from a stylistic tour de force, Russell Banks accomplishes a psychological study par excellence. I have rarely read \u2013 then consequently seen, felt, smelled \u2013 four characters as sharply as I did the four in The Sweet Hereafter. You may not like some of these four. But believe me: you won\u2019t forget any of them anytime soon.And the story? Yes, the story is harrowing \u2013 but not told without a dollop of humor now and again. Without that occasional narrative lagniappe, I\u2019m not sure I could\u2019ve made it to the end.But I did, and can now highly recommend this novel \u2013 my first of Russell Banks\u2019s, but certainly not my last.One additional citation \u2013 and this one from the bus driver:\u201cThat done, though, I kept myself away from all town functions, church affairs, meetings, bake sales, and so forth, and more or less oriented myself west and south, faced our life towards Lake Placid, where I had to take Abbott twice a week for his physical therapy, anyhow. Naturally, I no longer drove the school bus \u2013 two weeks after the accident, the school board mailed me a certified letter saying my services were no longer required, but I had already made that decision for myself, thank you. And since Eden Schraft never called me, the way she usually did, about carrying the mail in the summer months, I gave that up, too; a bit more reluctantly, however, than I gave up the bus, for I had no terrible associations with that particular job. Now, whenever I saw one of those big yellow International school buses on the road, I simply had to look away or else concentrate on a single detail, like the sum of the numbers on the number plate or the poker hand the numbers made, until the thing was gone from view\u201d (p. 223).Welcome to America, the Land of Opportunity \u2013 where the roads are all paved in gold, and which \u201ccan be an interesting town (country) when you see it from a tourist\u2019s perspective\u201d (p. 223).By way of conclusion, I\u2019ll cite Banks\u2019s own conclusion: a small-town demolition derby \u2013 an apt metaphor, I assume, for the larger story. I\u2019ll risk a further assumption \u2013 namely, that \u2018Boomer\u2019 (the last car standing in the derby, and which formerly belonged to the ill-fated bus driver whose thoughts I cited above) might well signal a generation just a \u2018derby\u2019 or two away from posterity and the grave. If my assumption is correct, Banks\u2019s inspired choice is a trope I\u2019d like to quietly applaud.RRB05/30/14Brooklyn, New York, U.S.A."}, {"userName": "Jeff", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/225885-jeff", "userReview": "I also loved the movie and it's rare that both hold up."}, {"userName": "Tim", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/730330-tim", "userReview": "When children die in a bus accident in a small town, there are plenty of questions but no easy answers.

I have never actually thought about the difference between the two until this book and now I think I have some (not much, but some) clarity between the two. In my experience, depression has hope attached to it. There seems to be beginnings, middles, ends, peaks, valleys, spikes, etc., to it. It can be softened by exercise, good food, literature, art, fresh air, etc.. Sadness, however, is a constant. It is always there. It doesn't go away. It is ghostly. Once it makes its presence known, it changes everything. This book, The Sweet Hereafter, to me, is about sadness.The Sweet Hereafter takes place in the 80's in a rural area called Sam Dent which a strange town located near Lake Placid. On a cold January morning a schoolbus crashes into an icy lake. Most of the kids on the bus died. Delores the driver survives as do a few kids.The story analyzes the emotional and logical perspective of the driver, the now paralyzed girl, a grieving father and an (out-of-town) lawyer who tries to cash in on the tragedy. Russell Banks also sheds light on the perceived perspective of the families of the aforementioned victims. The story also subtly analyzes how a tragedy like a bus crash can end extramarital affairs and child molestation. This is one of those books that reminds me just how dangerous secret sex really is. If anything momentous happens during a sexual tryst, neither of the parties involved can truthfully say what they were doing when that happened. For example, say you were in a motel having an affair when you learned about 911. If you are essentially \"caught\" by that moment in time, it will likely change two things: (1) how you remember 911 and (2) the desire to continue the affair. Things will change. The author examines the behavorior and attitude changes of the people involved in those untruthful moments truthfully but without being a judgmental jerk.This book also examines the multi-faceted nature of blame, guilt, expectation and exploitation. For my own future reference, I would like to point out that this author writes in a way that reminds me of Jodi Picoult. He offers different perspectives from those involved in the story and tackles moral issues with a delicate and nonjudgmental touch."}], "description": "When fourteen children from the small town of Sam Dent are lost in a tragic accident, its citizens are confronted with one of life\u2019s most difficult and disturbing questions: When the worst happens, whom do you blame, and how do you cope?
