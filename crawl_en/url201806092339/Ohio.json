Ostensibly, it is a novel about turmoil, the inner feelings and the outer experiences, that transpired in the years since 9/11, specifically for a group of small town high school friends who came of age during this time. However, as I read it, I felt a pull back to my own youth and the observations and feelings we experienced during the Viet Nam war. There are many differences, to be sure, but the same conflicted emotions and beliefs, the same struggles to make sense of it all in the midst of the exuberance and wild excesses of youth \u2013 none of that has changed.This novel weaves in and out, backward and forward, among students in New Canaan, Ohio. They are the jocks, both football heroes and the hero-worshipping volleyball-playing girlfriends or cheerleaders. They are geeks and nerds. They are children trying to figure out who and what they are and what they believe, in a town where alcohol and meth and oxy and sex and love and sorrow and Christianity cross all lines and blur together. The story is told in separate chapters from the points of view of the main characters, and move from the present to the past and back again in each chapter. This writing style could go horribly wrong in some books; in this one, it works to perfection. This is an intricate, detailed story; every character is key, and it\u2019s important to pay attention all the way through. I made the mistake of slightly skimming through the prologue, because I erroneously believed at that point that the book would be mostly narrative, and I wasn\u2019t sure I was going to like that. I was wrong on both counts; there is substantial dialogue throughout, and I found myself, at 75% through, going back to re-read the prologue because I loved the book so much, I wanted to make sure I understood every step the author had led me through before I reached the end.This is not a pretty book, but it\u2019s a beautifully written one. It is filled with darkness and horror, despair and pain. The sadness is overwhelming at times, but never does it not seem absolutely, one hundred percent real. There are lines that made me want to weep with the beauty of them, with the sheer lyrical loveliness of them. I\u2019m a sucker for any story that paints a picture so heart-breaking that you believe while you\u2019re reading it that you\u2019ll never read anything more perfect. Ohio did this for me.Be aware that this may not be an easy read for some of you. There are events that happen throughout that are unpleasant and traumatic, all the way to the very end. But I loved it.Thank you to NetGalley and Simon and Schuster for the privilege of an advance reading copy in exchange for my honest review. 5 stars, at the very minimum."}, {"userName": "Joseph", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1281880-joseph", "userReview": "Ohio by Stephen Markley is the story of a Rust Belt town and the people who live in it. Markley is the author of the memoir Publish This Book: The Unbelievable True Story of How I Wrote, Sold, and Published This Very Book and the travelogue Tales of Iceland.Growing up and living in Cleveland, I remember the tail end of the 1960s, 1970s, and the early 1980s, before leaving for the Marines.\u00a0 I can recall the culture and impending doom that Ohio brings out. The industry-based economy had been stumbling for quite some time with several false starts towards recovery. My parents moved to the suburbs in the 1980s which seemed nice, basically major crime free, nice schools, park, and library. Today the opiates have replaced marijuana. Unemployment leaves a chronic shadow on the community.I was drawn to the book not only by name and location, Northeast Ohio but also by the cover. I try not to be drawn in by the book covers but this one took me back. Although the convenient store on the cover displays the colors of the 7/11 chain, I was reminded of the Lawson's store at the corner of my street. There were quite a lot of memories tied to the store from drinking Coke on the loading dock, buying lunch food at the deli, and playing pinball inside the store.The writing in this novel is superb. There is a great effort\u00a0in the setting and the characters that creates depth to the story moving it from just a novel into literature:\u00a0A vortex of blue light spilled across the pavement, the streets, the downtown buildings, swirling violet violence\u00a0and a piercing hiss as the oxygen was sucked into another dimension.\u00a0 It flew backwards\u00a0into the hot cerulean\u00a0spiral, gazing mad black eyes, and when it passed over the edge of existence, the puncture in the universe wheezed painfully and then zipped up like a wound stitching itself shut.\u00a0Like the cover shot in the night, most of the book seems to take place in a darkness. The image of an eternal night is filled with things that are not seen by all or even most people. Night hides a variety of ills which the book slowly reveals.\u00a0The city itself is New Canaan which plays on Biblical Canaan. The Biblical Canaan was the promised land of the Israelites -- the land of milk and honey. New Canaan, however, is the land of broken dreams and anguish.\u00a0 Glory Days have turned to drugs, drinking, and self-mutilation.\u00a0 Industry\u00a0has left, the real estate\u00a0market never recovered, homes are foreclosed, a few bars and a local restaurant\u00a0is all that seems to remain.\u00a0The economic disaster that has come to define the region is brought out through the characters lives, four of which have come back to the city for various reasons.\u00a0\u00a0Bill Ashcraft an activist and outspoken anti-war crusader, whose life has become a blur of alcohol and drugs, comes back as a courier for former classmate Kaylyn.\u00a0 Stacey Moore a Ph.D. candidate in English returns to meet with the mother of her high school lover.\u00a0 Dan Eaton a veteran of three tours in Iraq and Afghanistan and balances his need to escape New Canaan and the girl he left behind.\u00a0 Tina Ross the daughter of a minister struggles with popularity and her beliefs.\u00a0 \u00a0Also having a major role in the\u00a0story, but only through flashbacks, are the football hero and Marine Corporal Rick Brinkland whose funeral opens the book.\u00a0 Lisa Han, half Vietnamese, raised by a single caucasian mother plays a central role connecting the other characters together.\u00a0 She remains a bit of the mystery as no one has seen her since high school but some have received emails and postcards.\u00a0The story introduces separate threads that weave together into a complete story.\u00a0 Each bit of information revealed in the story is tied together wonderfully by the end of the novel.\u00a0\u00a0Markley manages to introduce almost every key issue of that generation into the novel without forcing any issue into the story.\u00a0 Crime, drugs, terrorism, war, anti-war, sexuality, murder, sex, abuse both physical and emotional, are all pieces that complete the picture.\u00a0 Revealing the sins of the past brings little cheer to the reader. Instead, the reader will be rewarded with a dark story that is played over and over in may Rust Belt cities.\u00a0 Those who live or lived there know it well and others will be introduced to the American nightmare.\u00a0 Fiction mimics real life in Ohio.\u00a0Available: August 21st 2018"}, {"userName": "Joyce", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61807998-joyce", "userReview": "2 starsThis is an interesting debut novel. This books is a story about four late-twenties people who are tortured by their past. They came from a small town in Ohio nicknamed \u201cThe Cane\u201d for New Canaan, Ohio. They are trying to forge a future for themselves. The town itself has suffered hard times for quite a while. From the Great Depression to drug wars and, lately, the banking crisis with its attendant foreclosures and evictions; these all play a part in the story. The people who live there seem to be sunk into a kind of depression; a lethargy and hopelessness about their daily lives. We meet Bill who is an addict and a drunk who is on a secret mission to The Cane. This is a depressing book. I really couldn\u2019t understand the purpose of writing it at all, Dan, who is a three-time veteran of the Iraq war who is very shy and planning to take a former girlfriend out on a date. There is Tina who is lost in her own problems and others. While memorable, I really had no sympathy for any of the characters, especially Bill. I began to page through anything that had to do with him. I was tired of his ramblings and his nonsensical talk. I can\u2019t say that this book was well written and the plotting seemed to wander at times. As I said before, I didn\u2019t really care about any of the characters. I used sheer willpower to plow through this book, and I did not enjoy it. It was a trial. I don\u2019t believe that I\u2019ll read any more of Stephen Markely\u2019s books. On the surface, the premise seemed so good and promising. I was truly disappointed. I want to thank NetGalley and Simon & Schuster for forwarding to me a copy of this book for me to read."}, {"userName": "Loring Wirbel", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5593045-loring-wirbel", "userReview": "This is quite an achievement for a debut novel, though the despair of growing up in a small town in the Midwest as Markley pictures it is unrelenting. In the case of Ohio, the despair is not just the singular sort of \"lives of quiet desperation\" strung out on opioids, but a broader despair that pulls many of its characters toward crimes against their friends, and even against humanity, making the book downright horrific in the end. But that factor is exactly what prevents the book from being awarded a full five stars in my mind, because the suggestions for grace and redemption are so limited, the town of New Canaan seems like the horror-show version of any Midwestern town I've ever known. If and when Markley can season his prose with a touch of the sort of empathy practiced by Zadie Smith, Richard Powers, or even David Foster Wallace, he is bound to grow into one of the nation's best writers.The first few pages had me worried at times. Since Markley attended the Iowa Writers' Workshop under Ethan Canin, I was surprised to see a few passages early on that seemed both over-wrought and overwritten. Thankfully, by 30 or 40 pages in, those passages were replaced by a gripping narrative and occasionally brilliant descriptive prose that made it difficult not to get completely wrapped up in the four primary characters of the high school graduating class of 2003 that make up the focal points of the book. These are stereotypes of a sort, but stereotypes seen through a cracked mirror - a star basketball jock who turns to radical politics and too many drugs as a means of self-aggrandizement; a nerd who signs up for multiple tours of Iraq and Afghanistan as a way of finding a brotherhood of meaning; an apparently devout Christian girl who undergoes a lesbian awakening in high school. It's not the typical jocks vs. freaks vs. geeks tale of small-town America, but there is still a lack of subtlety in the characters that makes the reader occasionally want to say, \"Not everyone can live like Hunter S. Thompson, particularly if they're only high school seniors!\"As a matter of full disclosure, I should point out that I am a generation ahead of the protagonists in Ohio, though the problems of small-town cliques and drugs and dissipation did not seem to change much between the classes of 1975 and 2003. I grew up in a town of 5000 in mid-Michigan, so I know the territory well, but i did not have to suffer through Michigan under Snyder, Wisconsin under Walker, or any of the regional Trump-trolls. (Ohio is a special case under Kasich, but the state is full of Buckeyes gone bad.) Yes, a Midwest gutted of its industrial base is a grim place, both in terms of the narcotics problem and in terms of the political wasteland of resurgent white supremacy. And yet, and yet...I experienced a gruesome 2006 akin to the author's 2013, where classmates died in rapid succession from a bicycle bomb in Kandahar, a gruesome suicide in an ex-girlfriend's driveway, and a transient's stabbing of a paraplegic woman. I know what the year of climax for wayward alumni can feel like. Yet none of the graduates of my high school were active perpetrators of crimes as truly grim as those coming from New Canaan's best and brightest. The characters departing the town feel they are leaving a special kind of hell, and with good reason. I do not doubt that every small town has secrets, and that the numbers of serial murders and small-scale terrorist acts are greater than we know or wish to admit. Yet I always see my original home as a place of redemption and hope, not as a set for a Stephen King movie.The most empathetic and believable character in the book is the absent Lisa Han, who helped bring many other protagonists to self-awareness, yet who (apparently) got out while the getting was good. Of the four characters who make up the four sections of the book, only Stacey Moore is relatively easy to discern as a real person. Bill Ashcraft mixes a tough analytical world view with epic drug use, yet his politics seem carved from a Noam Chomsky cookie-cutter, and he is so self-absorbed, he seems never to have attempted the Buddhist dissolution of the ego that is an important part of any truly effective political actor. Dan Eaton's patriotism or reason for enlisting seem ill-defined, a reflection of his floating high-school years. Maybe his deceased friend Rick had a cornier view of American power in the world, but at least one could discern how Rick saw the world, and that he had a simplistic moral sense missing from many of his compatriots on the football team. And as for Tina Ross, she was indeed a damaged victim of horrible crimes, but she finds few ways of standing up and defining herself until the climax of the book.Meanwhile, we are greeted with high school pals like Kaylyn, Todd Beaufort, and the Flood Brothers who almost seem to be gargoyles in their one-dimensionality. Hey, we all know people from our graduating class who have \"ghosted\" themselves and become invisible, but Markley would have us believe that many of them are hiding horrors far worse than unpopularity or parental abuse. Maybe I'm a sucker for the bucolic scenery one can find in a small town, but my view simply isn't as unrelentingly dark as Markley's, and ultimately, I think this makes this less literary fiction and more horrific thriller. But the writing often is marvelous enough to fall into the former camp. With luck, Markley will opt for a slightly lighter touch and an empathetic, loving tone in future works that will make it easy to award five stars for novels to come."}, {"userName": "Kasa Cotugno", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2345554-kasa-cotugno", "userReview": "This is the kind of totally immersive novel that can keep you up at night. One night in 2013, four former classmates find themselves once more in New Canaan, Ohio, or as they call it, The Cane. Their reasons differ, but each is afforded a novella-length section for their story to be told in overlapping precise detail. Stephen Markley has written two other books, but this is his first novel, and as with many journalists, his prose is clear, incisive and totally involving. Despite its length, there isn't a superfluous word and no repetition. This is how the generation called \"the Millennials\" came to adulthood, and underlying it all, how Donald Trump became president. The former generation is hardly fleshed out at all - Millennials are front and center, their history developed under the effects of 911, the subsequent wars in the Middle East, the opioid crisis and the great recession. As if that weren't enough, crime plays a large part, but not in an ordinary or cliched way. People disappear, reappear, sometimes with little or no warning. I look forward to what Markley's does next."}, {"userName": "Paul ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6191890-paul", "userReview": "My College Sociology Notes. Circa 1997:Definition of Identity. How others see you.How you want others to see you.How you see yourself.This novel took me back to that classroom in college. My professor was trying to teach us the \u201cacademic language\u201d for what we were supposedly doing in those four years of schooling. Even though I am four or five years older than the characters in Stephen Markley\u2019s novel Ohio, I know exactly what they are going through. And really, we are all dealing with the same things in that point in our lives: Responsibility, politics, economics, sexuality, careers, religion, family. This masterful contemporary novel is about four people in their late 20s who are forced back to their hometown after being away for a long time. Caught between 9/11 and The Great Recession, New Canaan\u2019s residents have not fared well; several tragedies have hit the town hard in the last several years, from the economic downturn to heroin addiction to a soldier\u2019s death. Ohio forces the reader to take a long look at what happens to yourself and your town in those ten years after high school. How do young people grow into adults? How does the outside world infringe upon the innocence of our childhood?Markley focuses on six characters in total, four main stories which are bookended by a short prelude and coda. These characters are raw and complex. Some were strongly connected when growing up, yet all will collide into each other on this trip home. Bill is a lifelong rebel who has been asked to make the long drive home from New Orleans to deliver a mysterious package. Stacey is a current grad student whose sexuality does not exactly mesh well with the religious community in town. Dan is an army vet who has found a purpose outside of The Cane (New Canaan\u2019s nickname), but still has not found wholeness. Tina is a victim of many abuses and while she has found some stability in her life, she will not and cannot leave those wrongs behind. The authors tells these character\u2019s stories and the whole town\u2019s stories through flashbacks and character-told narratives. Markley\u2019s writing is impressive on every page; it\u2019s mature, lyrical and deserving of much praise. Ohio is not a book about living in the past, nor is it about trying to change the past, but as Markley so eloquently puts it, it\u2019s about the storm called progress. For me, the narrative combines a Richard Russo novel, Hillbilly Elegy, and Billy\u2019s Long Halftime Walk. It\u2019s an excellent contemplation of small town life in a part of this country, and a war that many people have forgotten about. I wholeheartedly recommend Ohio; it is very important literature.Thank you to NetGalley, Simon & Schuster, and Stephen Markley for the advanced copy for review."}, {"userName": "Lolly K Dandeneau", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1412404-lolly-k-dandeneau", "userReview": "via my blog: https://bookstalkerblog.wordpress.com/'You passed your time in the cage, he figured, by clinging pointlessly and desperately to an endless series of unfinished sorrows.

The author takes you into the dark recesses of his lost characters. There isn\u2019t much hope here. Of all the stories, the last hit me between the eyes. Tina Ross is returning home to Ohio, her mind on love. If her theory about love, \u2018that you can only have- really, truly- one love of your life\u201d, then it comes early and leads her back to Number 56, for her.

She is a mess herself, if once pretty and popular she is washed out and just as wrecked as anyone else in the novel. Then there is Bill Ashcroft, the smuggler distracted by the \u2018fraternity\u2019 of fellow aging, used up small town football athletes at the bar. It\u2019s a given, after all, to run into the boys \u2018relics\u2019 anytime one is back in town. High out of his mind and drunk, remembering his glory years where memories are tainted, and out of some misdirected rage others became targets, and each story veers off elsewhere. No two memories are the same.A small town like any other, bored teens with nothing to do but ruin each other or self-destruct. Factor in 9/11, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the earnestness when one first \u2018joins up\u2019 to fight a cause, the disaffected, broken returns, ambition that sinks you deeper until you abandon hope and you have Ohio.

This book begins as one young man returns home about ten years after high school gradation with a package taped under the fender of his pickup truck. On this fateful night he runs into several classmates and we learn of three who are also on missions of their own. Ohio unfolds in four chapters: Bill Ashcraft, Stacey Moore, Dan Eaton, and Tina Ross. Within those chapters we learn of their interconnected lives in high school and to the night they all reconnect in 2013. Markley shows the horrible effects of the boredom of coming of age in a small town. And sometimes boredom leads to devious acts. These devious acts are what keeps the book moving.

My starred review for this novel was published in the May 1, 2018, edition of Library Journal:Markley's ambitious debut novel (following a memoir, Publish This Book) reunites four high school classmates on a fateful summer night in their Ohio hometown, in what reads like a darker-themed epilogue to Friday Night Lights. Hollowed out by a generation of war, addiction, and crippling recession, the quintessential Midwestern town of New Canaan serves as a magnet for our protagonists, as they struggle to break free of their shared histories. There's an antiwar provocateur whose activism gave way to drugs and alcohol, driving back into town with a package taped to his truck; a doctoral candidate whose forbidden lover has not been heard from in nearly ten years; a reticent war veteran who chose three tours in Iraq over a future with the love of his life; and the quarterback's ex-girlfriend, whose beauty and popularity mask a shame that she finally resolves to address. Markley's prose sparkles with insight and supports an intricate narrative architecture that recalls Nathan Hill's The Nix and Patrick Somerville's This Bright River.

This book is uneven: cuttingly good when it's good and quite bad when it's bad. It's essentially about a fucked-up high school reunion--four classmates find themselves back in the small Ohio town they grew up in, each for different reasons and each haunted by different regrets. The pros: there are some really beautiful passages, and the inner lives of the characters are well-rendered and engrossing. The whole book is shot through with pain and nostalgia. It reminded me of A Little Life, and just like A Little Life it made me cry--I definitely broke down a bit during the part from Tina's perspective at the end. I like the way the main characters' lives are interwoven and I was touched by the ending. The cons: there are quite a few edgy teenage girl characters in this novel, and speaking from the vantage point of having been one myself, a lot of the parts of the dialogue felt like what a dude might imagine edgy teenage girls' conversation to sound like. Lisa, whom I thought was the most sympathetic character (a voracious reader! Rebellious and sharp-tongued but ultimately soft-hearted!) frequently talks about, er, certain sexual acts and body parts (like when she mentions Stacey's \"beautiful little pussy\") in a way that just felt unconvincing to me. Yes, teenage girls can be crude, but there's crudeness that's authentic and believable, like the characters in Kathy Acker's Blood and Guts in High School or Sheila Heti's What Should a Person Be?, and then there's crudeness that reminds the reader that the author is, well, not a woman, and that his attempts to depict interactions between women simply fall flat at times. I guarantee you that no lesbian in existence has ever organically uttered the sentence \"An American coed is the hardest kind of cunt to eat, but also the sweetest.\" I also didn't quite buy certain aspects of Bill's character, who is anti-authority, anti-capitalist, whatever, but also just goes on and oonnn about it indeterminably. Too much telling and not enough showing.Despite this I was pulled in by the plot and the prose and finished the book in one sitting. Markley depicts desolation really well--the brief glimmers of light in lives characterized by disappointment after disappointment and bad choice after bad choice. And I like how he writes about love: the desperation of it, the fever and the crash. Ohio is worth reading."}, {"userName": "Lou Jacobs", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64771688-lou-jacobs", "userReview": "Move over Spinoza! Stephen Markley in his Debut Novel has tackled both the \"Meaning Of Life\" and \"Coming of Age\" motif. His platform involves four high school friends haphazardly returning to their rustbelt home of New Canaan, Ohio .... some who refer to as \"Bumfuck, USA\" The town has fallen on hard times since \"9/11\" and slid into a slow progressive dissolution. The country is wallowing in the Iraq and Afghanstan war and recession. The four classmates find themselves drawn \"home\" in 2013 for a diverse set of circumstances. The four principals are Bill Ashcraft, although an athlete and friend of most is known for his early activist rabid beliefs .... only later to become an addict of both drugs and alcohol ... he finds himself returning home as essentially a \"drug mule\". Stacey Moore, now a doctoral candidate returns to confront the mother of her first female lover. Dan Eaton... an always shy and sensitive teenager, returns for a dinner with his now married high school sweatheart. His subsequent life has been shaped by his 3 tours of duty ... less one eye. And, lastly the pretty Tina Ross, returns for a confrontation with her brief boyfriend and football captain, Todd Beaufort - as well as the demons from her past. The story unfolds in four long sections, involving each main character ... flitting back and forth between present day an \"back when\" ... the previous events , thoughts and motivation are inter woven with their present mind set .... and brought into perspective are their interrelationships. In the last quarter of this tale the tone changes to a much grittier subtext. The denouement leads to an exciting murder mystery with an unexpected and satisfying conclusion. Markley weaves a complex and multidimentional tale utilizing both precise and lyrical prose. The end product is a gestalt that certainly is greater than the sum of its parts. Thanks to Netgalley and Simon & Schuster for allowing me to be one of the first to enjoy this tour de force in Proof format ... in exchange for an honest review. I expect to read much more from the pen of Stephen Markley."}, {"userName": "Robert Walton", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21737938-robert-walton", "userReview": "Having finished \"Ohio\" by Stephen Markley, I am amazed that this is a debut novel. I was mesmerized not only by the story, but quite often by the writing itself. There are sections of the book (in particular, a description of a photograph of several high school students at their prom) that I had to highlight on my Kindle; they were that good. War, friendship, love, betrayal, desperation, and the results of 9/11 and the war in Afghanistan are depicted in a way that kept me turning the pages while savoring each one.Don't expect a plot synopsis; not my style. You can read about the plot on any sight that carries this review. The novel explores one night in 2013 when four former high school friends (individually, not together) return to the town of New Canaan, Ohio, and the encounters each has. Each of the books four major sections follows one of these characters, and alternates between that night and flashbacks to other events in their life. Events only hinted at in one section are documented in later sections. In this way, the novel's impact unfolds gradually, allowing the reader to savor and wonder how these four stories really intersect, both in the present and the past.One example is \"The Murder That Never Was,\" an event that all of the major characters mention, and which the reader wonders about until the book's very end. The conclusion arrives with the impact of a bullet. It was shocking, and entirely real. I cannot imagine a more satisfying conclusion after following the events of this night, and the many others that led up to it. In short: if you enjoy a good mystery, character-driven, with intriguing writing, and a realistic depiction of small town struggles, grab this book next August!"}, {"userName": "Suzanne", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12479785-suzanne", "userReview": "Author Stephen Markley has attempted to grasp the confounding impulses of Millenial lives and the early decades of this new century and create a major theme of loss and regret.

His focus on the rust belt and its citizens leaves us with no sense of hope, though. If this is our present, our future is grim.

I was drawn to this book mostly to see how the author portrays my home state. He is spot on with the drug problems plaguing the marginalized areas of the rust belt. The character development makes one love and hate each character through the flashbacks to their youth and choices that were made. One excerpt that really stood out to me was \"This was about disappearing. People, she'd come to understand, disappeared all the time. The world simply opened its jaws and stalled them whole. They vanished, and unless they were rich or famous or particularly beautiful, they did so almost without comment. There was bitterness at murder, grief at accidents, and fury at suicide. But to disappear -- well, there was only mystery.\" This made me think about classmates that have disappeared to me and probably vice versa. I cannot wait to see this book reach the shelves.

New Canaan, Ohio is the place and the lives of four high school friends are told in some of the most brilliant prose I have read in a debut novel in years. This is not a feel good story, it is an honest telling of what many Americans face every day of their lives, and how they deal with each situation.

Thanks!I am not completely sure what I want to say about this novel. On one hand, I really enjoyed reading it. In some ways, it reminded me of  The Secret History by  Donna Tartt. The book is told from the point of view of four different people who attended high school together in a small town in Ohio. The story begins when one of the men returns to the town, and encounters each of the others. These encounters lead to flashbacks of high school and early adulthood for each character, providing the reader with differing viewpoints of the same external events during that time period. The novel does a great job of digging deep into each of the four characters-they all felt fully fleshed out and believable. While reading the flashback from one character's viewpoint, the reader wonders (along with the protagonist in that section) about the motivations behind another person's behavior. Then, as we read about the same events from a different point of view, we gain a different understanding of the same situation, which sometimes answer the questions in the mind of the first character, but always bring up additional questions and a new interpretation of the events in the reader's mind. I thought Markley accomplished this quite well.I started reading this novel on a Friday, read about 2/3 of it over the weekend, and then finished it and finished it the next weekend. And I think the challenge that I had with this novel has something to do with that reading schedule. I had a pretty quiet weekend, and was able to spend quite a bit of time reading. During that period, I was really enjoying the novel-I loved the different character's voices and felt myself drawn into the sense of intrigue that revolves in and around groups of friends during high school. The complex interrelationship between different characters, and who knew what about who felt so believable-I remember feeling exactly that way when I was in high school. Unfortunately, when I got back to the novel after work on Monday, I had lost the thread, and suddenly the web of relationships had become too complex. I remembered peoples' names, but I was not always sure where they fit into the web in regards to the character whose story I was currently following, let alone how they fit for earlier characters. It felt a bit as if I had reconnected with someone I knew in high school on Facebook, who then they told me some salacious gossip about a mutual friend from our past. Although I remember our mutual friend, and can picture the situation, I don't experience that feeling of \"of course\" or \"now I understand everything\" that I might have felt during high school. It is just too long ago for me to fully remember and understand the complex web of relationships that provide a context for me to process that piece of gossip. This is not the first time this has happened to me; for example, I don't often read novels that don't have a fairly straightforward plot structure, because I lose the thread of the story easily. I honestly don't think there was anything specific to Markley's writing that led me to feel this way. But unfortunately, it left me enjoying this novel less than I might have if I had been able to finish it before the weekend ended. That said, I would definitely suggest that others not be deterred from reading this novel because I did not give it a higher rating; I also gave The Secret History only 3 stars and 76% of the other readers on Goodreads liked it more than I did."}, {"userName": "D", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20756258-d", "userReview": "What happens when a once prosperous town suffers through the great recession, opioid crisis, race and gender issues, and the middle east wars. The four main characters in Stephen Markley\u2019s novel, Ohio, have lived through all of this during their high school years, and later cross paths directly and obliquely as young adults in 2013, where the bulk of this story takes place. In addition, a fifth character, the high school football star who goes off to perish at war, is the unifying character who\u2019s funeral begins the book. The structure is not unique, buts works exceptionally well in this novel. The four main characters have their own lengthy chapters, or novelettes within the novel. We get an opportunity to spend a lot of time within their unique viewpoint. When we eventually shift to the next character\u2019s story, we experience the same high school through adult years, adding new layers to the narrative. Each of the characters stories intersect with each other, and in many instances you will have an \u201caha\u201d moment when an earlier situation is further explored through another perspective. Many authors have done this to different degrees, notably Falkner\u2019s The Sound and the Fury. At the end, we have the full picture depending on the reliability of each of the narrations. Markley paints a bleak picture of a town that has suffered terribly, and the characters carry enough emotional and even physical baggage from youth to present time to make this a very dark book. The characters are not all that likable. Some have even done some pretty deplorable deeds, but despite all they, they are deeply developed and are painfully relatable. All in all, this huge, sometimes sprawling tome engages you in their world by pure emmersion.Not to say there isn\u2019t any criticism. Much of this book seems to be overwritten and downright verbose. It seemed to improve as time went on, or perhaps I just adjusted to the style of Markley\u2019s writing, but a little better editing could have shaved a bit of the overly discriptive passages. Markley\u2019s thesaurus got a good workout! Markley\u2019s style of withholding key information for later effect was also overdone. At times I felt that I may had missed an important part of the plot and had even reread large sections or did a search through the text to try to fill in information I may have missed. Important facts were withheld only to be revealed later on, often in a flashback, creating another one those \u201caha, that\u2019s what they were talking about\u201d moments. Confuse the reader, then hit them with a clarifying moment. Effective if used sparingly.Despite those very minor qualms, this book is definitely recommended for a serious reader who is not afraid of experiencing a darker slice of 21st century America."}, {"userName": "Kimberley", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10651832-kimberley", "userReview": "High school history can stick with you for the rest of your life. In a small town in Ohio, people who grow up together are defined by those years, no matter how long it\u2019s been or how much they\u2019ve changed along the way.In the prelude we get to know about the image the town presents during Rick\u2019s memorial parade. A parade that is steeped in patriotism. New Canaan is a staunch bastion of patriots - the right side of politics. Lurking in the shadows, though, is a meth and opiate crisis. The stuff that people like to hide in the shadows. Markley gives us this prelude as insight into what we are about to experience with Bill, Kaylyn, Rick, Stacey, Dan & Tina, and the assorted others involved in their lives. We start with the story of Bill Ashcraft. He\u2019s an \u201cactivist\u201d but also a drug addict/alcoholic. He was asked to transport something back to his hometown that he really didn\u2019t want to go back to, save for one Kaylyn, the girl he\u2019d always loved. Stacey Moore was Bill\u2019s high school girlfriend, with secrets of her own involving Kaylyn. Tina Ross, the good girl, who was once involved with Bill, but later moved on, wasn\u2019t such a good girl after all. Dan Eaton, the good guy through and through, who served in Iraq, has come back for just a one night dinner with his ex. And lastly, Rick Brinklan, big time football dude who lost his life in Iraq and is still thought of as a war hero in his hometown. This story takes place over just a couple of days in \u201cthe Cane\u201d, but it travels through time retelling history from high school. Markley does an amazing job of immersing the reader into each character\u2019s story, each nuanced little bit of what has followed them from high school into adulthood. The timing of the middle east wars and the recession in the US sets a backdrop for New Canaan, a once middle-class bastion, now just a rundown suburb with a Walmart for its hub. The drug epidemic that America is facing takes center stage in this town that was once a thriving factory community. The tale of New Canaan is not unlike what is happening all over America today.Not an easy read, this book is powerful in its storytelling. Stephen Markley is a master of words and character development. The threads of each person\u2019s story is sewn together in a climax that will leave the reader stunned.

The layers come off slowly and go deep. It's a moving, sad story of four people who knew each other in the past and whose lives interconnect on one evening in the present. (Note: there is some dark, violent stuff in this book that could be triggering for some people.)I hard a hard time getting started with this book, but I'm very glad I stuck with it. It ultimately become so much more than I thought it would be. I think my struggle was in kicking off the book with Bill's story. Bill is a bit of an asshole and he's high as a kite for much of his quarter of the book. He name drops various people from high school, but it's hard to see the relevance of those details or what the connections are at that point, so it's tempting to just let all of those details go by in a blur. Don't make that mistake.However when I got to the second, third and fourth stories (and coda), the book started to really gel for me. I started to more fully appreciate the quality of the writing. I started to get a bigger sense of how time and place defined these characters for better or worse. I began to really pay attention to who knows who and what sorts of things happened in the past that are affecting the present. I think by the time I got to Dan's heartbreaking section (at the halfway mark) I began to fall in love with this book.The coda is both powerful and sad, (But also a bit frustrating--what exactly did Bill smuggle into town?) full of some beautiful passages like this one: \"The most astonishing gift of consciousness was also our tragedy, our cliche, our great curse: Love's absolute refusal to ever surrender.\" Ultimately, it's love that drives most of these character's actions.

His writing is remarkable, with vivid images, and sophisticated vocabulary. I appreciated the breathtaking landscape descriptions; he does an amazing job of luring the reader in with his imagery.However, the sheer darkness and despair of this novel, made much of it incredibly difficult to stomach. When I first read the blurb, I had hopes for something akin to The Big Chill, replacing college buddies, with highschool friends. However, I was certainly mistaken, as there was little to no redemption or hope for any of the characters. It was simply pain, hardship, regret, and loss. The great majority of characters were unfathomably edgy, and being teenagers, it made the story quite disturbing. I honestly had to read past several scenes that were too gruesome to imagine a child doing.Despite such difficult scenes, Markley did an incredible job of creating a feeling of desperation and recklessness that was all-encompassing.

At once a murder mystery and a social critique, Ohio ingeniously captures the fractured zeitgeist of a nation through the viewfinder of an embattled Midwestern town and offers a prescient vision for America at the dawn of a turbulent new age.", "title": "Ohio", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36373372-ohio", "average": 3.83, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1513975401l/36373372.jpg", "reviews": 42, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3340737.Stephen_Markley", "name": "Stephen Markley"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3340737.Stephen_Markley", "name": "Stephen Markley"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Mystery", "Literary Fiction", "Contemporary"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36373372-ohio", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39024902-ohio", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7633589-publish-this-book", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17882286-tales-of-iceland-or-running-with-the-hulduf-lk-in-the-permanent-dayligh", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17790698-the-great-dysmorphia", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25316666-the-worst-of-stephen-markley", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
