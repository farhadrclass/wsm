Fascinating. Among her points are that there are four groups of people in the world: right-leaning antimoralists, left leaning antimoralists, those who disdain morality, and those who are genuinely moral. She writes a lot about how the American way of life, and the \"offended narcissism\" of modern life, contribute to a lack of morality across political persuasions. Interesting book but not a ton of help to the book project."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5962480-cheryl", "userReview": "Liked the concept and feel like I should have been a sympathetic reader, but found it too idiosyncratic in its definitions, as well as too abstract (\"the moral mind\" is talked about as if it were an entity unto itself). I do like her attempts to reframe what is moral and take to task both the \"cool\" Left and the self-satisfied Right -- but could not get past the approach, which seemed to lack intellectual rigor."}, {"userName": "Sylvia Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13811812-sylvia-johnson", "userReview": "I especially liked the first part of the book as it rings true and gave me much food for thought. However the last part sometimes felt like a harangue against scientists and psychologists whom she feels should not speak about ethics since it is not their field. She feels that they are leading our society away from true morality."}, {"userName": "Alan Hughes", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2425565-alan-hughes", "userReview": "This was an enjoyable read which does suggest an alternative way of looking at morals and the moral individual. She does propose some ideas which accord with my view of the current changes in our culture. It is perhaps over long and her reliance on Freudian writers'support for some of the psychological insights do weaken her case."}, {"userName": "Irus", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/219446-irus", "userReview": "I started this book over the weekend.

Full of theories based on philosophical opinions.

She has a very flat writing style and the topic (which is interesting) never really comes to life."}], "description": "The Good Life is an engaging, reasoned look at American values: how the angry political right hijacks and corrupts ideas about morality, how the fringe political left abandons the moral outlook, and how antimoralism from many sources results in cruelty, harsh law, dangerous irrationality, corrupt religion, greed, and gross inequality, and undermines American democracy. Cheryl Mendelson reminds us how far these trends have taken us from our roots, and how a humane democracy, with its freedoms, depends on the moral sense of its citizens.Medelson gives clear-sighted descriptions, free of ideology, of what morality really is, tracing it to its psychological roots, and of the antimoralism behind familiar cultural tics like authoritarianism, the culture of \"cool,\" irrationalist movements in politics and religion, and the sterility of academic attempts to understand the moral life. Along the way, she gives a clear, persuasive explanation of why moral truth exists and why believing this doesn't force us to be dogmatic and judgmental. Mendelson's book is a bracing polemic, but it is also inspiring and, with its eye-opening analysis of the moral mentality, an education in what it means to be moral in an antimoral world.", "title": "The Good Life: The Moral Individual in an Antimoral World", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13166672-the-good-life", "average": 2.9, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348823854l/13166672.jpg", "reviews": 8, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15567.Cheryl_Mendelson", "name": "Cheryl Mendelson"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5847144.Melody_Englund", "name": "Melody Englund"}], "type": ["Philosophy", "Nonfiction", "Psychology"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13166672-the-good-life", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79388.Home_Comforts", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61173.Morningside_Heights", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27654.Love_Work_Children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61172.Anything_for_Jane", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61161.Laundry"]}
