In some haunting way the Ben was part of it.

This is a feat that I probably would not have accomplished if I had any other options to occupy my time, because this was a really boring read.Imagine The Heart is a Lonely Hunter but without the tension, without a plot, without any of the interesting characters, and with a lot of gophers. Dead and alive gophers. Oh, and set in the prairies.To be fair, there were some good scenes in the book that did keep me reading but they were so under-developed in favour of the simplicity and celebration of the thoroughly uneventful, that they are hardly worth mentioning.

Now and again a twig would break off suddenly, relieve itself of a white burden of snow, and drop to earth.\" The prose is absolutely beautiful; you are in the scene- in the prairies, in the wind, in the cold... and he creates each character so completely, you wholly understand everyone in the town.

However, if you seek a deeply touching novel of intelligence and substance, indeed I urge you to read Who Has Seen The Wind.  It tells the story of a prairie boy\u2019s initiation into the mysteries of life, as he discovers death, God, and the spirit that moves through everything: the wind. The plot details the little things in life that most of the masses overlook, and accurately relates the expressions and deep feelings of a young person growing up during the Great Depression. At the time I read it in school I could relate very easily to the primary character, Brian O\u2019Connal. The novel\u2019s greatest strengths lie in its sensitive evocations of Brian\u2019s feelings, sometimes associated with his various experiences of death, sometimes with a child\u2019s fundamental, inarticulate but insistent curiosity to discover the world within and beyond himself. I was lost in the character\u2019s maturation and progression as a person. This book is truly one I will never forget. WHSTW has definitely contributed to the way I looked at life in general, as a young person at the time."}, {"userName": "Sheila Craig", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10920159-sheila-craig", "userReview": "I first read Who Has Seen the Wind in school when I was about 13, back in the late 1970's. It was the first book that truly touched my soul. Remember in the movie of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone when Harry first holds his wand in Olivander's shop? It was like that. I couldn't wait to discuss it in class. My teacher asked some question I've forgotten, and I raised my hand and enthusiastically expressed the fullness of my heart and all the novel had revealed to me. My teacher flatly responded, \" No, that's not what the author meant at all.\" Sitting back in my chair, at that moment, I understood the fallibility of teachers, and further that THIS teacher didn't have a clue. W.O. Mitchell's genius was utterly clear to me. He had somehow spoken to me, a girl of 13 living in Ottawa, across the decades and the miles, and my poor teacher had missed out on the transmission. My teacher's loss, but not mine. I've kept that paperback novel ever since, moved it from hovel to apartment to house, and now some 37 years later, with some trepidation, I decided it was time to read it again. Could it ever capture my heart as it did when I first looked on it with young, fresh, innocent eyes? Miraculously: Yes! I am enraptured now as I was then. This is not a story in which big events happen. On one level, it is the story of a little boy, Brian, growing up in a small town on the prairies in the \"dust bowl\" years, a thoughtful boy who learns to grow into a compassionate, caring human being. He learns from being affected by life and death (too many deaths for a young boy), and finding a spiritual grace in nature. On another level, it is a love story for the Canadian prairies, and a parable of the value of wilderness and wild things. It is also a exploration of good and evil in the hearts of men and women, and the \"group think\" that allows decent people to follow the path of least resistance. Two different characters refer to Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness (in referring to the same third character).Within these pages, Mitchell has brought to life a wide cast of believable characters with a light but precise touch. His exquisite descriptions of life and nature show his love of the prairie landscape. Throughout, he weaves thoughtful explorations of the meaning of life and what it means to be human. So glad I read this again!"}, {"userName": "Dianne", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3222213-dianne", "userReview": "Brian O'Connal is a little boy living on the Canadian Prairies with his parents, his grandmother and younger brother Bobbie. This is a gentle and touching look at his early years in a small town where everyone knows everyone else and it's hard for a boy to get away with anything.The authour takes us inside Brian's home life and school life, his ups and downs with friends, neighbours and a new puppy, and then (spoiler alert) the tragedy of losing his father when Brian is still a young boy. His father's affectionate nickname for Brian was \"Spalpeen\" and the reader can feel Brian's aching loss, knowing he will never hear his father speak that name again.The writing is quite beautiful. One of my favourite things about reading is coming across a line that perfectly describes a thing I have thought or felt but never found words for. One such in this book is \"Within himself, Brian felt a soft explosion of feeling\". Isn't that wording lovely? Another line I love is \"The poplars along the road shook light from their leaves\". So perfect and I can see it, can't you?Mitchell seems to create that \"small town on the big prairie\" feeling effortlessly. It's nice to read something that makes you want to slow down and savour every word, breathing in the airy atmosphere that feels safe and yet wild and uncontrollable at the same time.The copy I read was a library loan and I was lucky enough to get the illustrated version with lots of monochrome, and a few full colour, sketches. It was a sizable book, probably 14\"x10\" so the artwork was large and, like the writing, easy to get lost in.

I will, however, try to keep an open mind about it, and I'll give it my best shot. Here we go!Update July 29th: About halfway through the novel now. As expected, I'm not really liking it at all. I'll admit, it's not bad in the sense that I want to smash my face in with an anvil, and the writing isn't too shabby. It's just so boring. There is no plot at all. There's no story, no conflict, just a little boy and his psychotic friends killing gophers and philosophising about God while the narrator goes on and on about Saskatchewan scenery which is, *ahem* excuse me, NONE. IT'S FLAT. THERE IS NOTHING THERE. NOTHING.Needless to say, I am so confused.Update July 31st: I take back what I said before. This was a bad book. A bad, bad, bad book. Horrible, dry prose, mentally unstable characters, and distant narration that keeps me from relating to or feeling sympathy for any of the characters just made this book a terrible reading experience. The only characters I liked in the entire novel were Miss Thompson and Mr. Digby, and their subplot was the only one I found interesting. Everything else was just irritatingly slow and positively drowning in imagery. I don't care if this is a \"Canadian classic\", it's just a bad book.Please excuse me while I read some Kenneth Oppel.

Distant he had heard the sound of grown-up voices casual in the silence, welling up almost to spilling over, then subsiding. The cuckoo clock had poked the stillness nine times; the house cracked its knuckles, and the night wind stirring through the leaves of the poplar just outside his room on the third floor, strengthened in its intensity until it was wild at his screen.He had thought again of the strange boy on the prairie and felt, as he did a stirring of excitement within himself, a feeling of intimacy elusive as the pale perfume of a violet.\u201dBut also in there lies my crux. This mature thought is about a boy just of age to be starting school. And, this inability to understand such elusive feelings continues throughout the book as he grows to his teenage years. The reader picks up on Brian being a somewhat precocious boy unaware of and learning the dos and don\u2019ts of life, but also that he is sensitive to life\u2019s cruelties which are accompanied by feelings he doesn\u2019t understand. He is also drawn to the town\u2019s outcasts and sympathetic to the injustices and cruelty placed upon them. The story is set on the Canadian prairies in the 1930s. Brian\u2019s hardships focus more on death and loss, though others in the community suffer from the impact of the drought. Many of those community members (teachers, principals, ministers, doctors, storekeepers, farmers) play parts in Brian\u2019s life and their stories intertwine with Brian\u2019s. Town politics and policing, school discipline, religious influence, and economic disparity all play roles in the story. For this reason, I found the book interesting. Unfortunately, some of these parts dragged, while many of the sections focusing on Brian\u2019s shenanigans were highly entertaining. I recommend this book for people interested in life on the Canadian prairies during this time period, but for me it was a choppy read."}, {"userName": "Ibis3", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4093912-ibis3", "userReview": "[--that sadistic gopher scene was especially tough (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Jim Puskas", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7429967-jim-puskas", "userReview": "Given the enormous reputation of the author and of this book in particular, I found it diappointing. Certainly, the imagery and lyricism are outstanding; so as a book of prose it sits at the head of the class. And Mitchell's portrayal of the socially oppressive environment of a prairie town rang true -- perhaps a Western variant of Davies' Deptford with all its local petty tyrants and their victims.But that failed to make it an enjoyable story -- in fact there's not much story at all, just a set of character studies. Mitchell goes to great lengths to make his main character real and appealing but in the end he's just an overly-sensitive child whose fancies appear to spring from his Irish ancestry. The other characters are mostly archetypes -- the aging schoolteacher posing as a philosopher, the frustrated younger teacher who can't get her love life sorted out, the town drunk/bootlegger, Mrs Abercrombie the tryannical self-appointed arbiter of social standing.

Mitchell\u2019s prairie world of the 30\u2019s (a decade earlier than the book\u2019s publication) is a Norman Rockwell kind of place. There are boys and dogs and a rogue (though not real bad) uncle.

There's no central conflict, no malicious demon (Although one could argue Mrs.Abercrombie on that one) or force that the protagonist needs to overcome. There's struggle and tension but no organized, story-driven plot. It's a simple premise done beautifully and remarkably with all dialogue and accent pushed through and driven so you can hear the old Prairie dialect and tone with each character.Ultimately my lust for slice-of-life maintained the book at the 3 star rating as I felt the sheer amount of gross death was, although probably period appropriate, I felt...numb by the time we reached the last death, like I was able to predict how each chapter would end as it often ended with a bird, gopher, family member, neighbour or farm animal exhaling their final breath.

I read these with an involuntary smile on my face, interrupted only by temporary bouts of melancholy during the book's more tender moments. Then, in the book's final act, the story naturally, perfectly transforms into a meditation on the way in which we live our lives, and the way in which we come to terms with the impermanence of our existence. The transition is not abrupt, though the change in the direction of the story is significant.
