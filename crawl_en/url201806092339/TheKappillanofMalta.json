Father Salvadore's homilies to the community sheltering from Italian and German bombing in the catacombs take the form of histories of the islands during some of its greatest trials. Labeled \"Hexamerons\", after the six parts of Genesis, it would be insulting to call them Michener-esque (Monsarrat is the far better writer), they begin in 1500 B.C., threading through St. Paul, Suieiman, the Knights of Malta, etc.Still Father Salvadore and his trials are the central focus. Born into the most noble family of Malta, and also the son of an English Naval Captain killed at Jutland, Salvadore doesn't move with the sleek and polished--in his 50s, he's still a parish priest. But, and perhaps because of his Naval heritage, one with greater compassion for deprivations caused by war, and the need for forgiveness for the sins so compelled. War is another path to loss of innocence, even if it's not so obvious to the brass and the bishops.Readers will come away feeling as if they've walked every inch of two of the three Maltese islands; as if they know the rocks and shoals of the Grand Harbor of Valletta. But prepare also to be moved--by the mystery of faith, by the wisdom of simplicity, by the power of injustice over understanding. And, by the way Monsarrat lovingly describes Malta, the Maltese, and the events that made his character Father Salvadore a worthy heir of the Knights of old.\"The late fishermen were all going one way, down the harbour; the early stone-masons were going another, up to the heights where rich men were always building and poor men were always propping up poor houses. Lawyers were hurrying to catch an early tide of profitable envy and malice; shop-keepers were slamming back their barred doors, and rolling down the bamboo curtains which softly replaced them. Priests, crossing a slit of sunshine in a narrow street, passed businessmen who predictably kept to the shadows.\"\"It was time for honesty. 'People behave in the catacombs as they do in their own home. It *is* their own home, quite often. Their only home. But there is always fear, mother. Terrible fear of the war. So they----' He did not know how to phrase it, and it was very important. 'So they seize on life, before death seizes upon them. The good people are better, the bad people are worse. The drunkards drink more. The people in love are more in love. Those who hate find their hatred turned into loathing.' He was almost pleading with her, it was so important. 'But they are all God's children. What is in their souls, good or bad, was planted there by God, and it grows by His will and His mercy. I pray all the time that *all things*, even the wickedness of war, may be turned to good. But am I to say, Do not drink, when drink is the only thing that gives a man courage? Am I to say, Do not make love where others can see you? *They may never make love again!* Am I to tell a boy, Do not kiss so fiercely, it can lead to mortal sin? *It is his first kiss, but it may be his last!* Am I to tell a child, Be polite, say please and thank you, don't make a noise, Jesus tells you to be gentle and good? What does a child see and hear when he walks into the world outside?--blood and horror and enough noise to deafen him, and as much gentleness as he would find in hell! So where is Jesus Christ, his gentile Saviour? \u2026 I beg your pardon, mother,' he said, seeing her startled face even as he wondered in his own very soul: Did the child ask that terrible question or did I? 'I did not mean to be so--emphatic. But when people talk of bad behavior, I wonder where they spend their nights. I wonder where is their charity, their compassion. Let me assure you, I have seen *nothing* in the catacomb which God would not forgive.'\"\"There was so much to do besides pray\u2026He rose from his knees and, after looking round him, quietly joined in on the work of mercy.He became aware of a moving, bending, fetching-and-carrying throng of grey and tired men: hard-pressed doctors, sick-berth attendants, ambulance men from ashore, stretcher-bearers from other ships in harbour. He fetched glasses of water. He sat and comforted and consoled. He bathed sweating foreheads. He eased bandages too tight for the raw wounds they covered. He brought bed-pans, and disposed of them. He held on to men's hands until he could feel that, out of two sets of clasped fingers, only one retained its grip.He noticed, now and again, a servant like himself, a naval padre in tattered uniform surmounted by a blood-stained dog-collar, busy at the same work. Once they passed each other in a passageway. They were both carrying vase-shaped urinals, one full, one empty. The Englishman grinned, and spread his hands ruefully, and passed on. It seemed to Father Salvatore that the brotherhood of Christ had never been better expressed.\"\"She had been to midnight Mass, a few hours earlier, but it had been a woeful performance.All the time her thoughts had strayed. Try as she would, she could only think of him. He was up there, flying somewhere in the black night: nearer to the Star of Bethlehem than anyone in the church. Nearer to the Birth, nearer to death.It was love in war. Michael was going to telephone, as he always did: not immediately he got back, which was what they both wanted, but as early as he could interrupt a great household. It was love in war, uncertain and beset by unmentionable fears. Marriage was not yet even a word between them. The family was aware of him, but only on a careful plane of non-involvement.\"\"As spectators screamed in anger, Mason lost his nerve, whipped his horse round, and galloped back to the citadel. But he had made too many enemies. On foot, chased by a howling mob, he ran through the narrow streets for the house of Notary Bezzina and there, panting, took refuge. Within minutes, the doors were battered down and the mob surged in; within minutes, a balcony window above was flung open, and Colonel Mason's body, sailing through the air like the pebble [from the slingshot that first hit him], landed with a crash on the cobbled street. The priest who ran forward and knelt beside him was too late to catch his soul.\""}, {"userName": "Hermien", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5930747-hermien", "userReview": "A bit old fashioned but a lovely story and a great Maltese history lesson."}, {"userName": "Tom Dawn", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71360500-tom-dawn", "userReview": "It's a big old book and, as happens in such sagas, you have time to become involved in the characters.

There is gentle humour, deep feeling and much information. It's an extraordinary book about an extraordinary place in extraordinary times, when lives where cheap and yet the simple joy of living more often than not won the day. But it's not just about Malta in the Second World War. It's about the Maltese. Told by a lowly village priest (by choice), descendant of one of Malta's original noble families, the story gives a vivid picture of Malta's idiosyncrasies and its history: from St Paul, the knights of St John (and their epic battle with the Turks), Napoleon, Lord Nelson, and Captain Ball, eventually the Islands first British Governor.That's why I didn't want to write the review - that paragraph of 'what it's all about' can't possible do credit to a novel where history and imagination meet masterfully until you can't tell any longer what's which, a story which pulls you in until you fall asleep thinking of Marij and her lover, where you root for Dun Salv in the catacombs...When I got to the end, it was like losing a friend."}, {"userName": "Helen Strobridge", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6579493-helen-strobridge", "userReview": "Whilst spending the winter on Malta I sought out some books set there. This is quite a struggle to read at times, telling not only a story of Malta under siege in WWII, but also extracts from various earlier periods in its history. However, as Malta has had such a long, complicated & dramatic history it is quite an achievement to get so many historical events in to one book. After a slow start I really got into the WWII part of the story, which spells out just how horrific life on Malta was during those years. Living amongst the areas described in the book made it even more graphic. The story of the family of the main character was engaging and enjoyable, although some of the prose was overly wordy.However, I felt that the book lost its way towards the end, and I was very disappointed in the ending, which I didn't feel held true to the character described about throughout the rest of the book. I would have liked to score this book higher, but felt let down by the ending."}, {"userName": "Audrey", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3499522-audrey", "userReview": "Having been to Malta and interested in its history this book is very good read and very enlightening about a very bad time in Malta's history."}, {"userName": "Jeanette Hall", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14958334-jeanette-hall", "userReview": "Fascinating story of a priest on the Island of Malta during the war - I really couldn't put this book down.

Malta, a British territory, was only 60 miles from Sicily and served as a submarine port interfering with Italian and German activities in North Africa.Father Salvatore Santo-Nobile, son of the powerful Baroness Santo-Nobile, had no need to seek out power or recognition. He was pious and yet had a good sense of humanity and some of the failings of individuals which allowed them to survive in an environment of death and destruction on a daily basis. When the bombing started on the first day of the war, catacombs were uncovered that provided shelter for many of the displaced of Valletta. In these cramped confined quarters there existed very human people, who expressed terror and love and a need for spiritual support. Father Salvatore, Dun Salv, provided that despite the disapproval of his superiors.Excellent story about a good man and a history of the War of which I was unaware."}, {"userName": "Nancy Hartill", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13962470-nancy-hartill", "userReview": "A day-tripper, traveling from Valletta to the Isle of Gozo finds himself caught up in a crowd of people on a ferry. He discovers all of them are all heading to a funeral for a lost icon for Malta, Dun Salv. Salvatore grew up in a wealthy family, but chose a life as a priest. Most of the story is about his good deeds during WWII and his time in the catacombs, scrounging for food for those who have sought refuge there, and recruiting followers to aid in the survival of the Islands. He has some issues with other priests there, and struggles to keep his mind on the priestly path. He gives solace and strength to those who have trouble coping with the events of war. His sister's daughter falls in love with a very charitable English soldier, and his father becomes quite the disgust of the family. I like this book because I traveled to Malta with a Christian Tour celebrating the discovery of what is believed to be the Anchor's of Paul (the Apostle). Dun Salv fits into his sermons a very concise and all encompassing history of which the Maltians are so proud, and he touches a very good history of Paul's path to Malta."}, {"userName": "Dee", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21096051-dee", "userReview": "This was recommended to me while I was visiting Malta, and I am SO sorry that I've got to the end!

However, Monsarrat at times takes sidetracks, foremost to the love affair of his niece Marija, but also to events his hero couldn't possibly have known, for example stories of convoys trying to reach Malta. Here Monsarrat's own military history shines through, as he was on such convoys himself then.The novel is written rather leisurely, and the book is surprisingly low on conflict, despite the war setting. But the book's biggest flaw is that most of its content is information-driven, not plot-driven. This means many sentences, alineas and even great chunks of chapters are devoted to information on Malta or on war ships, which in no case have anything to do with the characters we're following. Moreover, Father Salvatore's speeches (the hexamorons) are most obviously there solely for the purpose of telling of Malta's history.Meanwhile Monsarrat's view on the war is even less complex than that of wartime movies like Casablanca, and his characters are remarkably flat and cliched, with the love affair between Marija and Michael the British pilot as a particular low point. The book's best chapter is 'In Limbo', in which Father Salvatore suddenly evolves as a character. Unfortunately, the consequences of his personal change are never resolved, and the reader remains behind, puzzled and disappointed.This book is interesting (but no more than that) for anyone visiting Malta - all other readers should avoid this."}, {"userName": "Jule", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36549340-jule", "userReview": "Malta is a fascinating island with a long history.

In this novel, Malta\u2019s history is retold.The structure is quiet interesting: the frame story tells how the author found out about the story he is telling. Then there is the actual story, which re-tells six days of the Kappillan in World War II, when Malta was bombed by the Italians. At the end of each day, the Kappillan finds his way into the catacombs, the shelter of hundreds of people, and tells a story there, which forms the third plot. Each story is about the Maltase fight against an invasion: the Phoenicians, the Romans, the Turks, the British\u2026 Six days, six episodes from Maltese history.All in all, this book is something for those that love Malta: it is quite detailed and deep, and not really a historical novel, but more a history book.
