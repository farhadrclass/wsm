And I was not ready for the onslaught of emotions that caught me unguarded. Frisson-y feelings aside, I felt like a voyeur reading it because the me who wrote it and the me that I am now are two completely different persons. (I couldn't recognise the wide-eyed girl who spout things such as \"In my mind, I like to think of you as my favourite book. In boy form.\" Who the heck says such cheesy crap???)Love letters are personal business between two people. And because I am a soppy assclown, I have no compunction in poking my nose in said other people's business.This book was beautiful, featuring letters from back in the 1930's (those handwritten/typewritten beauties. I found them really charming).Such as this one-(Totally reminded me of John Mayer's Half of My Heart, btw. <3)But I think I couldn't connect to it on a deeper level because these letters/notes were meant for someone else. Still, it was cute and so cuddly! Also, reading the back stories of a few of the letters was endearing. Also x2, why no letters between lesbian/gay/transgender couples? D: It miffed me a bit.Bonus Read- This glorious letter was written by Frida Kalho to her husband Diego Rivera. (English translation painstakingly done by me; apologies for any errors.)\"Nothing is comparable to your hands, nor is anything same as the gold-green of your eyes. My body is filled with you for days and days. You are the mirror of the night. The violet light of the lightning.The dampness of the soil. The hollow of your armpits is my haven. All of my happiness is to feel the life which bursts from your flower-fountain that mine keeps to fill (?) all the paths of my nerves that are yours.\""}, {"userName": "Athena", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2452727-athena", "userReview": "\"I think i enjoy being single.

I have no idea whom they were for, I bet that these people's letters made so much more sense to them and they drank every word up of these letters and enjoyed they so much more than a stranger (like me) ever could, because I wouldn't never understand.

These are rejection letters, text messages, telegrams, breakup letters, letters of apology, but there are also true love letters that honestly had me crying at times. I quite enjoyed how some of these letters even included a postscript with explanations on some of the letters, or of details on what transpired after the letters were written. \u2019And I shall love you until I draw my last breath, and beyond.\u2019This was a charming collection of letters although I would have made slight adjustments if it was up to me.

There's something about other people's correspondence, particularly romantic correspondence, that I find hard to resist.I felt ok about being a voyeur (and so was able to enjoy the book) because the letters were reprinted with permission of the author, or in some cases, the author's closest living relative. Some of these letters were very, very private and it would feel wrong to read them behind someone's back, as it were. But since they were cool with it, I could be as well!I think I also enjoyed this because I am in a committed relationship. The letters reminded me of our own courtship, our current relationship, and even our future. They made me feel quite sappy towards my husband but I think they would have made me sad if I were not in a relationship.At the end of the book we get a little more background and/or aftermath of a few of the letters. I liked having the context of some but not all of the letters, leaving the rest up to my imagination (much like Pete's Unsent Love Letters, in fact.

It spanned this womans life from abt 20 to 30 yrs old. And the whole thing was this self absorbed petty nonsense. As I became intimately acquainted with this woman I did not come to empathize w her at all. There are some truths here regarding my attraction/repulsion at the intimate lives of others but I dont know what. Do they hold up a mirror to how unimaginative and small my sentiments are? Does it make me feel hopeless for humanity since they seem so incapable of true love? The truth is, there was this one awesome note in this collection. It was by this old man to his wife. It was a series of cartoons of him going on his morning walk alone, and in the sky above him there is this sun-like thought bubble with the name of his wife in it.

JaCOb.\"(the accompanying picture includes a little boy, presumably JaCOb, beaming a care-bear-stare-style laser beam of pink hearts towards a cute girl, presumably PHoebe) by the end, i felt a lot better about the state of relationships in our world today. there's got to be something real about this \"love\" shit if so many people experience it in such similar ways over and over again. i come from a background in science, you know, where variables need to be independently tested to produce real data and i feel like the emotions we stir up when our chemistry lines up with the planets and we see a cute face across a room and end up waking up next to them for a couple of decades; well, it's an independently-verifiable fact."}, {"userName": "Danica", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/666037-danica", "userReview": "Much less than I expected.

The problem I suspect with collating love letters in a venture of this sort is that you get a self-selecting population that reads and responds to open calls for materials published in books of this kind.
