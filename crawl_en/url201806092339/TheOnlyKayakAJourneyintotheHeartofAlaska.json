First - the author's voice. Kim is fully and completely open as he describes how a place brought about his metamorphosis. His honesty and authenticity commanded my attention. Even more impressive is his conviction. Kim describes how his experiences led to him becoming a 'conservationalist,' and he doesn't mince words about the sadness and challenges that came with standing on those convictions. This story has kept me up at night since I finished reading it. The courage it takes to stand on that line moved me. Kim lost some important friendships because of those convictions. That place were two people can't see eye to eye...where it is impossible to span the divide between opposing convictions - is deeply sad - but at the same time, profoundly courageous.Finally - this story strikes at something deeply personal - it gives voice to a collection of my experiences and musings regarding life in Southeast Alaska and our relationship with the natural world. It resurrected memories of hypocrisy as I witnessed a culture that once lived with deep respect for the land, but today has clearcut and raped that same land in the name of profit, leaving an ugly wasteland. Today, that same drive for profit has depleted our oceans and rivers, and I am a part of this process. Big halibut used to be the norm when fishing around Prince of Wales...but are now the exception. How many salmon did we happily fill our freezer with...only to sit there until freezer-burn took over because we took too many. How many good people and their families depend on livelihoods that do not respect the land that sustains us?In all, this is a profound book that touches some deep and difficult subjects. But his sometimes self-deprecating tone left me laughing-out-loud, and his touching insight into the side of human-nature that is profoundly generous left me tearing up. This is an incredible book for anybody who has considered their relationship with the natural world, or who considers nature their playground."}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2280602-lori", "userReview": "One of the best books I have ever read. He insightfully questions what it means to be a part of modern society but still long for open spaces, to experience wildness, to be a human in the midst of a world so inhuman. It's one of the most profound works of philosophy and poetry I've encountered in a coming of age story. He somehow manages to capture the stunningly visual landscape of Alaska into a verbal dialect that is a conversation with the reader but it's so astoundingly thoughtful that you feel like you are reading a photograph. I can't describe this the way I want. He takes you on a journey of discovering self inside a changing landscape that is a mirror image of the inner psychological, emotional, and spiritual questions we all try to understand. He manages to illuminate the mystery and wonder of Alaska. From the first time I came to Alaska and became bound under her spell I have been at a loss to describe the reality of it to my friends and family and now I can easily recommend they read this beautiful memoir by a man who truly gets what it means to be here and why it is so hard to describe the immensity of this vast north land and he does it more articulately and eloquently than I ever could."}, {"userName": "Richard", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1662632-richard", "userReview": "From the January 2012 issue of Backpacker magazine: Required Reading:From the first sentence\u2014\"I live in the sunlight of friends and the shadows of glaciers\"\u2014this book is a uniquely descriptive and often-gripping tate of Heacox's life in Glacier Bay, Alaska.

But if only those fit enough to hike and kayak in a remote place such as Alaska can enjoy its beauty, who will speak to protect it from commercial exploitation?

The author combines some of his personal background and story with the natural and political history of Alaska. Heacox is a beautiful writer, and his love for the great wilderness shines through, as does his pain over some of the inexorable changes that are taking place there (and all over our great earth). While nothing like it, the quality and passion of Heacox's writing remind me of the great \"citizen writer\" Terry Tempest Williams."}, {"userName": "Marion", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16030-marion", "userReview": "Wow. I loved this book - part memoir on Heacox's life in Alaska, part meditation on the changing landscape of Alaska, part essay/soulful plea for conservation of our wilderness, part story of gratitude for family and love. It's also a story of moving from grief (over the land and over the loss of a dear friend) to gratitude. Heacox's love for the wilderness runs deep and is contagious; I was moved by his writing."}, {"userName": "Kristen Luppino", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11644141-kristen-luppino", "userReview": "Thought provoking. I really didn't enjoy the first half/two-thirds of this book, but the end mostly redeemed it.

Kim shares 25 years of his life as he recounts the friendships made and lost, his marriage and the changes that are inevitable in wanting the share the beauty of a place yet keep it the same.This book caught my eye since a friend of mine expressed an interest in kayaking and I thought I\u2019d like to try it myself. I don\u2019t think this book will help as it\u2019s not a how to on to kayaking, but it is a beautiful memoir on the author\u2019s life in a place he finds beautiful and wishes to remain that way.

The author takes us on a true journey of the Alaskan Wilderness. He gives you the feeling of truly being a part of Alaska. This is the Alaska I want to catch a glimpse of when I visit there. I want to see the wilderness.I have not been one to read much non-fiction but the life this man shows us in the book makes you want to be part of it, one with nature. God made all creatures humans being last we always want to make it about us (humans) but some things were meant to stay the same and change naturally not to be changed by us. If we don't protect the wilderness areas and take care of them they will all disappear and then future generations will never have the opportunity to see what it is like for real they will only have pictures and stories."}, {"userName": "Jenna", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1091011-jenna", "userReview": "I only read this book because I know the guy who wrote it, and I thought it would be interesting to see a different side of him even though this isn't my usual sort of book. It was really deep, and definitely worth reading, and it was actually painful how vividly he wrote about what Alaska used to be, and how it is changing, and how much more it is about to change. I've been to Alaska, seen its majesty, and I know what it was he wrote about. The only reason why it isn't 5 stars is because I wouldn't read it again-- for someone like me, who lives purely on a diet of fantasy, it was a challenge to get through even though I wouldn't exactly call it boring, and the style of writing is so descriptive and detailed it takes too long for an impatient youngster like me. But I would definitely recommend it to everyone who is above about age 10, and especially those who have been to Alaska."}, {"userName": "Colin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34431-colin", "userReview": "I wasn't sure what to expect with this book, I picked it up in Bar Harbor simply because of the title and cover photo - reading the back cover blurb confirmed it might be something I'd like. It was indeed. The author tells the story of coming to Glacier Bay, Alaska in the late '70s as a park ranger, falling in love with the place, and eventually settling there over the next few years. His 'only kayak' allegory appears several times throughout the book, to describe the changing appearance and feel of the land and national park which he has come to love. Like the glaciers which created the landscape, outside forces are still shaping the area for better or for worse."}, {"userName": "Katieann", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11347956-katieann", "userReview": "By far the most heartfelt and real book I've ever read. One day while in the travel section looking for a book on Puerto Rico (I was going on a trip with my family), I saw this book sticking out of the rest slightly, which caught my eye. I read the inside cover and was immediately transported into the wild wonderfulness of Alaska, and it's people. Kim Heacox's writing is one of the most beautiful styles of writing I've EVER read. It's truly straight from the heart. I'm a fourteen year old girl, and yet I found it exteremly relatable.

I went to high school and hung out with one of the author's favorite friends, Hank and learned a few things about Hank that I hadn't known of when I hung out with him. I went back to Gustavus and kayakked GB again last summer '07.

I wanted to ration the book and make it last as long as possible. I reread numerous passages, just for the emotional tone they conveyed about a place.

His writing is excellent as he relates what he saw and how it affected him in his 30 year history with the Glacier Bay National Park. His stories of the friends and acquaintances he gains along the way add a great note of humor and help bring his own personality into focus."}, {"userName": "Gary", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1580449-gary", "userReview": "I found this to be a pleasant reflection of life in Alaska by a guy that just seems like a very nice/thoughtful/community-oriented naturalist. It isn't full of crazy action/adventure (although there is some), but rather it conveys the beauty & dangers of Glacier Bay and explores what role people should take towards protecting the land. I especially enjoyed his interactions with photographer Michio Hoshino.

Re-read it after my own trip to Alaska earlier this month. Heacox's passionate love for the natural beauty of his adopted state is poetry as prose. The variety of his personal experiences living and working in Alaska give him a strong voice as a committed conservationist, who has long walked the walk, and feels a responsibility to talk the talk. A deeply moving portrait of a rapidly changing landscape."}, {"userName": "Correen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8811289-correen", "userReview": "A beautiful memoir of his life in Alaska, covering years of developing a relationship, marrying and his life with his wife, traveling through the beautiful landscape, observations of the growing problem of environmental desecration and lack of policy, his love of children, and purchasing the land that once belonged to his late friend, Michio.
