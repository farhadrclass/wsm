Ms. Farley's attention to background information and details ensures Saturdays at Sweeney's can be read as a standalone.I like everyone in the extended Sweeney family, and feel like they are my friends and close neighbours. It's upsetting to see Captain Sweeney's Seafood Market go up in flames. This was the family livelihood for decades. What will they do now? What or who started the fire at Captain Sweeney's Seafood Market?Why was Lovie already there when the firemen arrived? Does Lovie have Alzheimer's disease or is she suffering from shock?Jackie and Bill have a secret. Will she share the secret with her sisters? Will Faith tell Mike and Sam about her suspicions?What does the future hold for the Sweeney sisters and their families? I enjoyed reading SATURDAYS AT SWEENEY'S and highly recommend this thought provoking, heartbreaking and suspenseful story. 5 stars.Thanks to Ashley Farley for gifting me an ARC of Saturdays at Sweeney's in exchange for an honest review. * This book is being released today, January 16, 2018."}, {"userName": "Shalini", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57308589-shalini", "userReview": "This is the fifth book in the installment of Sweeney Sisters. But since I have not read the first four, I have to admit, I read this book as a casual novel without bonding with any of the sisters. Ashley Farley is explanative in her prose, so I could keep up with the happenings of the past. But in this book, being the last, the characters are pretty set in their ways. They move with an air of don't you already know me from the previous books? An already known feeling pervades the pages. Maybe that's one of the reasons, I couldn't feel their emotions. I didn't know them; they were strangers to me. The story goes thus, the seafood store goes up in a fire, the sisters are at a loss, both in their livelihood and the plans of a future for themselves and the children. There are crisis abound, health issues of their mother Lovie, with child problems in elder sister Jackie's life, middle sister, Sam having lost her entire means of living in the shop fire, the younger sister, Faith being stalked by a criminal ex. All this makes the book a series of happenings. I wouldn't say I loved the sisters and that I want to be a part of Sweeney Sisters, I certainly don't. I couldn't feel the bond between them. The real emotions between sisters felt lacklustre in this. Maybe being the final book, I am already supposed to feel their love from the previous books. The sisters have lot of untold hidden secrets, which keep on getting solved as the pages turned. I couldn't find that closeness, which sisters normally share even during the problems. The core of this final book, the vein that threads through its pages is never stop living, never stop dreaming, never get scared in starting a new life, whatever be the age. And this point resonated deep within me, as it stands true in my life too, especially while standing in the cross roads of life. Maybe one day I would go back and read the series in order, to fall in love with the Sweeney Sisters. I received an ARC from NetGalley and publisher Kindle Press and author Ashley Farley and this is my honest and unbiased opinion."}, {"userName": "DJ Sakata", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18344018-dj-sakata", "userReview": "Favorite Quote:Did you fail sharing time in kindergarten?My Review:I have enjoyed this relevant and engaging series featuring three divergently different Lowcountry sisters and their addled yet feisty mother. Throughout the series, the sisters have faced a great deal of dispiriting hardships and challenges. This fifth and final installment of the series was fraught with tension from the beginning as it started with a fire to the family business that brought on a truckload of trouble and opened a channel for either a complete loss or a new opportunity. Each household, although while also blessed in many ways, was struggling with significant and overwhelming issues as well as the overriding critical element of the swift deterioration their elderly mother\u2019s mental faculties. This concern was hitting close to home for me there is a rapidly ticking clock, and not an if but a when, until I will be facing this same despicable dilemma. Ms. Farley\u2019s insightful narrative captured their inner conflict and turmoil with sensitivity and occasional hits of amusing levity which I fully appreciated as I've always found it preferable to laugh than to cry. I will miss the Sweeney sisters but was more than satisfied with their swan song."}, {"userName": "Sue ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/690922-sue", "userReview": "Reading about the Sweeney family again was so much fun - it was like having coffee with longtime friends and catching up on old times. This is the final book in this series but I sure would love to read about them again sometime in the future.As the book begins, Sweeneys's Seafood Market is on fire and it looks like arson. When the fire department realizes that Lovie Sweeney had been at the scene when they got there and was unable to answer their questions, she becomes the first suspect. With the family's business gone, Sam and Faith need to decide what they will do next in their lives. Plus their children who planned to work at Sweeney's after college need to make decisions about their future. To top it all off, Lovie is diagnosed with Alzeheimers and her memory is rapidly deteriorating. I can't tell you much more without giving away any major plot points but I can tell you that the family has problems from all directions and it affects every one of them. Can they remember that it's family first and pull together for the good of the family???This is a wonderful book about family and love. I have two sisters and I love reading books about sisters who always remember the importance of love and family. I know this is the last book in the series but would love to read more about this family -- maybe a book about the next generation?Thanks to the author for a copy of this book to read and review.

In fact, I want to live in Prospect! It sounds like such a divine town and they come together as a town and a family to help those in need.This book hit home a little bit because of Lovie and her dementia/Alzheimers. I felt so bad for Lovie and her daughters as they dealt with her decline and what was best for her in the long run.Faith had her past rear its ugly head and while she is the one that needed to deal with the situation, delaying telling her sisters put them in grave danger. I enjoyed reading a little bit more about the children and the issues that they faced as they grow older.

I was shocked to realize it\u2019s the final book in the series and the first one I\u2019ve read! The author brings readers up to speed, though. Reading about the Sweeney sisters and their families in Prospect made me think this is the perfect kind of small town dysfunctional heaven.\u00a0There were a wide range of events happening and packaged all in this book with the cute cover: a family\u2019s battle living with Alzheimer\u2019s, the family business being destroyed, family secrets, alcoholism and recovery, drug abuse and therapy, younger generations starting their college pathways, a strange mystery of occurrences, and a sleazy tabloid writer. It didn\u2019t shy away from those hard topics \u2013 it faced them head-on.\u00a0Each family member has his or her own spotlight throughout the book to continue the narration and plot.Each of the Sweeney sisters had their own secret to hide and each of those things continued to build up the tension and draw out the suspense, while their children are also struggling to move forward in their lives.The book begins with Sweeney's Seafood Market on fire. The preliminary report points to a lightning strike, but further investigation reveals arson. The fire department is reluctant to point fingers, but it must be noted that Lovie Sweeney was at the scene before the fire department arrived. She couldn't answer their questions and becomes the lone suspect.\u00a0As Faith planned to step away from the business and leave it to Sam, she and her son Jamie must decide what their next move with the family business will be. Is this a total loss or a new beginning? Jaimie's entire summer plan was to work at Sweeney's. It is looking dismal with Lovie being the center of the fire investigation. The insurance won't pay out in the event of arson.\u00a0Sam's husband Eli must recuse himself from the investigation, but is right there alongside it every step of the way to ensure it is executed properly. From day one, it is not. It results in further disorientation from Lovie, who doesn't seem to know who Eli is. She is living in the past, and Sam is still with Allen. Concerned for her well-being, the sisters remove their mother from her townhouse and install her in Faith's home. With no job to report to every day, and stuck in limbo with the direction her life should now take, Faith readily volunteers to be caretaker extraordinaire for their mother. Lovie's mental faculties continue to decline, and soon she is becoming combative and hard to care for.Suddenly dead animals begin showing up on the sisters' doorsteps, with their mother's hand-written recipes attached. Whoever set the fire is taunting the Sweeney girls. Faith quickly discovers who the true culprit is, but she never shares that information with her sisters or even her husband. Instead, she does what she wants to and ultimately puts her mother and daughter at risk.\u00a0The oldest sister, Jackie, is busy running her interior design business and looking to expand. Spending much of the week out of town, she is disconnected with the family. After trying to convince her sisters to place their mother in an amazing care facility, she is kind of on the outs. She is struggling to keep customers happy, sell her current location, and purchase a new showroom. Meanwhile, one of her sons is arrested on drug charges. Additionally, he is kicked out of Jackie's alma matter for straight failing grades his freshman year. He is brought back home and everything about it is kept a secret.\u00a0Jamie is tasked with babysitting Sean and they both get jobs at a local restaurant. In the time the boys aren't working the restaurant, they are out catching crabs and selling on the site of their burned family business on Saturdays. Soon, Jamie connects with his half-sister and goes to work with her catering company.\u00a0This is the story of real life that real families face every day. It was eye-opening to family, loyalty, love, motivation, distrust, secrets, fear. It is also a wonderful example of how important it is to be understanding and supportive of your loved ones going through tough trying situations. I connected so well with this family and fell in love with them.\u00a0I definitely want to go back and read the first four books in the series."}, {"userName": "Kristine (The Writer's Inkwell)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8123570-kristine-the-writer-s-inkwell", "userReview": "I have found that my love of the Sweeney Sisters novels hinders on my appreciation for the character of Sam. As the middle sister, Sam is the backbone of her family and seemingly is the only one who has grown up over the past several years/books. As the family\u2019s business goes up in flames, Sam finds that she is completely alone in deciding if she should rebuild or move on. Her sisters are not invested in rebuilding the family\u2019s legacy and they spend much of the book too wrapped up in their own personal dramas to care that their sister has ultimately lost everything. After all, the locals suspect and blame Lovie Sweeney of setting the business ablaze, especially since she was found at the scene of the crime and showed signs of complete confusion.One of the reasons it\u2019s difficult for Faith to be available to support or help Sam, is because she is busy trying to figure out what she wants to be when she grows up. Another reason is that their mother, Lovie is clearly deteriorating and Faith takes it upon herself to take care of her. But Faith hasn\u2019t really grown as a character in this series. When she discovers who may be the true culprit, she never thinks to seek out her sisters or confide in her husband. Instead, she makes one bad decision after another that puts her, her daughter, her mother, and the rest of the family in harm\u2019s way.While I had a hard time sympathizing for Faith, I found Jackie to be utterly repulsive. I have never really been a fan of the eldest Sweeney sister and her actions/story line have only further contributed to my lack of disinterest.Now that I\u2019ve gotten past my gripes, let me tell you what I truly love about this book and this series. This series is about a family that is not perfect and they have a lot of ups and downs. They make mistakes, keep secrets, and get into trouble. But at the end of the day, this family saga gives me insight to the love and strength of a family. This is something I am not fortunate enough to have in my real life, so it\u2019s nice to live vicariously through the Sweeneys. I also enjoy the way the family rallies around one another in a time of need (with the exception of my gripes above). At the core of it all, it is the family aspect of this series that makes it a hit with me. I love reading about how the family is growing and changing. It\u2019s even nice to see some of the younger perspectives being introduced and their storylines developed.

They love deeply, argue deeply, speak their minds but family is the most important thing to them at the end of the day (even if sometimes their actions speak differently!).In this novel, emotions are running high and the pain is very raw. Lovie, who you fall in love with right from the start, is at the center of an arson investigation of her own family business! For months, she has been showing signs of Alzheimer's and this had already had the girls on the fence on how to care for her but when because of this she is being blamed for arson, a decision needs to be made and fast. While the girls in their hearts struggle with the idea that their Mother could have caused the fire (and deep down they know she couldn't have), all fingers point to her.With this background, the girls need to decide not only Love's future but their own and the future of their family business - do they rebuild, do they move on or do they change? While this is all taking place, life is still moving forward - children are moving home, facing crises, addiction and major life changes!Saturday at Sweeney's is a well written, unique to the series novel that you will not want to put down.

The book starts off with Sam Sweeney being called and told their family business is on fire. She is shocked as the rest of the family but hurt when the police believe her mother was responsible for the incident. Sam is basically in charge of running the family business and hopes to rebuild with her son Jamie, who doesn\u2019t want to leave his hometown. Jackie doesn\u2019t really want to deal with the problems surrounding the business nor the issues her son, Sean is having, but is quick to give advice to her sisters.

She is an author I will continue to follow. This book shows the realistic interaction within a family, which made me connect with the characters. The mystery aspect is just a plus. The twists and reveal were unsuspected but worth the wait. The transitions Lovie goes through in the book made me sympathetic to her family\u2019s issues of placing her in facility.I read this book with determination to find out who committed this crime because to blame it on an elderly woman with dementia was bugging me.

The matriarch of the Sweeney family has been working in the family store, keeping everyone in line, and generally running the family. Now it is her turn to be taken care of. I am thrilled with how the family comes together and each play their part to help her continue to enjoy life. The three daughters all come together in a different way which I found to be very true to life. I love this series and these characters. There is no doubt that I recommend this book. Pick up your copy and enjoy the southern charm of the Sweeney Family."}, {"userName": "Anne Rightler", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6047166-anne-rightler", "userReview": "Having read several of the books in the Sweeney Sisters series, I was looking forward to reading book #5 and apparently the final one of the series. I was not disappointed with Ashley Farley's Saturdays at Sweeney's. I love reading more about characters from previous books, how things are turning out for them, how relationships have developed or not. It is like catching up with old friends and sometimes there are some new friends too. Farley has created vibrant and realistic characters and brings to life the time-tested bonds of a family and a community as she portrays the healing power of friendship and love. A well-written story, Saturdays at Sweeney's is full of profoundly human emotions and authenticity as the characters deal with the tragedy of a destructive fire and the tragedy of Alzeheimers Disease. I'm sad to see the series end but perhaps we readers can hope for another series that will be just as poignant and compelling as the Sweeney Sisters series. I received a complimentary copy of the book and was not required to write a review. The opinions are my own."}, {"userName": "Jeanne Maliner", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57243996-jeanne-maliner", "userReview": "Having pre-ordered Saturdays st Sweeney's, I thought I would read it as soon as I received it. I didn't cause I was bummed about it being the last of the series. After reading it, I realized that the author chose the perfect place to end the chapter on the Sweeney sisters. It couldn't have ended any better and all the mysteries were tied up neatly. There were new dilemmas so it wasn't the same old, same old, but lots of familiar faces that I came to love. Each of the sisters faced separate tragedies and one that would affect the entire family right down to little Bitsy. Excellent plot. It grabs you and won't let you go until the last sentence. The characters are real. The locations perfectly described. I would like to live in Prospect. I highly recommend this book and the entire series."}, {"userName": "Laurie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11486717-laurie", "userReview": "The Sweeney family is back!

Faced with losing their family business, the Sweeney sisters struggle to figure out their next steps. As each sister struggles with their new directions, the reader is shown the strength of this family. Ms. Farley has managed to create a series that captures the reader and makes them feel like they are part of the family. Her characters are realistic and flawed but perfectly written. Her books, including this one, deal with real life issues in a thoughtful and sensitive manner. While I am sad to see this series end, I love that the author wrote it in a manner that did not leave the reader with any questions."}, {"userName": "Margie Shaw", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42918716-margie-shaw", "userReview": "I received an Advanced Reader Ebook Copy of Saturday at Sweeney\u2019s from Ashley Farley in exchange for my honest opinion. I have read every book in the series, this one makes 5, and have loved every single one! It\u2019s about the Sweeney family and their lives in a small town called Prospect which is in the Lowcountry. There are 3 sisters who are the main characters, and although I hate to admit it, I seem to favor Sam, the middle daughter. Ashley covers many everyday topics that we all go through in life and I think that\u2019s why the books are so easy to relate to. You can\u2019t help but love this family and it feels like the characters are real and that you actually know them. This particular book covers some very sad and upsetting topics, but just as in life, things aren\u2019t always happy and perfect. Alzheimer\u2019s is the main topic, with a little drug addiction, guns and fire thrown in there. I have recommended all of these books to my reader friends. If you haven\u2019t read about the Sweeney\u2019s yet, you really should. Believe me, you won\u2019t be disappointed!"}, {"userName": "Janet Boyd", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50500011-janet-boyd", "userReview": "Sweeney Sisters Series Ashley Farley is a gifted writer that builds her characters with imagination and surrounds them with family that is so complex, that it makes them seem like our own. Then, she divides them into a series, that is both defining and continuous at the same time. I have been completely swept up in the family turmoil and loved every moment. I hope they're is another series in my future! Thank you, Ashley, for the hours of entertainment...as a South Carolina girl myself, I'm left feeling homesick, smelling the salt air and longing to feel the sand on my feet."}, {"userName": "Kristi Fleming", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5629695-kristi-fleming", "userReview": "Saturday at Sweeney's is the final chapter in the series. For me it was the worst written book of the series as well. 1. I really dislike how the author repeats multiple times about something that occurred in past books.2. It seems odd that brand name of items were mentioned instead of the generic term. It seemed to  me that the author did this in order to just add more typed characters to the book.3. There was a lack of connection between characters and their emotions.4. Loved how Alzheimer's was brought to the forefront and a reflection of care giving shown.An okay series overall."}], "description": "Members of the Sweeney family, young and old, chart their courses for the future in this final installment of the bestselling Sweeney Sisters Series.
