I was expecting (and hoping for) a nice story about the author's grandmothers and what she learned from them. There is some of that, but as the book goes on it kind of turns from memoir into self-help. The author seems to think that if we all just lived more like her grandmothers that the world would be a perfect place. Even worse, nearer to the end the author starts throwing in her own parenting and life opinions in. I am not familiar with the author outside of this book and I was not looking for parenting advice based on her opinion and what she's read (but didn't cite). Meh. I was not impressed."}, {"userName": "Onceinabluemoon", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1840592-onceinabluemoon", "userReview": "Love learning every aspect of her life through her many books.

Modern women in a world that was changing faster than most could imagine. In Trigiani\u2019s newest release Don\u2019t Sing at the Table she tells the stories of these two incredible grandmothers that influenced her life. Both from different parts of Italy and transplanted to the United States just in time for the industrial age of factories and US made products. Both Lucy and Viola in their own respects were women of fierce passion and fulfilled lives.In a matter of pages I was completely drawn in to the story of Viola and Lucy. I\u2019ve never read anything by Adriana Trigiani, but after reading the stories of her grandmothers I want to pick up all of her books. In the past I\u2019ve never been able to find the appeal in lengthy memoirs or even biographies of others, but Trigiani\u2019s telling of the lives of her grandmothers was something completely different. These women were incredible! Both fierce in the way they lived their lives, though they were both quite different. Each was equally compelling and I\u2019ve learned so much in the span of a few days spent reading about their lives.One of the things I learned through the course of my reading was that Trigiani\u2019s love for these two incredible women could not be categorized. There was no winner between the two grandmothers. Each had qualities that she incorporates into her life everyday and they\u2019ve influenced many of the choices she\u2019s made. Viola was forward thinking, a powerful woman in the world and at home. Lucy was strong and independent despite the loss of her husband early in life. And so much more from each.Don\u2019t Sing at the Table: Life Lessons from My Grandmothers was such a wonderful read. From the beginning, which starts out as a telling of Viola and Lucy\u2019s incredible (but separate) lives, to the end, which transforms into a summation of tips and advice garnered from them. This was a completely enjoyable read, maybe especially because I\u2019m no longer very close with my grandmother\u2019s but do remember them somewhat in this same light. I\u2019d absolutely recommend this story to anyone looking for an enjoyable read about passionate women and the ways in which you can incorporate their lives into your own."}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3847543-emily", "userReview": "A FANTASTIC read--author Trigiani (Big Stone Gap series, Lucia, Lucia) writes her first nonfiction piece about her two Italian grandmothers and the advice they gave her about life, love, and work.

Curious to learn more about her and her family, I decided to read this book first. At first I had a hard time getting into the book and relating to her stories, but as I got further into the book I found a few connections. It turns out her one grandmother grew up & lived 20 minutes north of where I grew up. Both my grandmothers were at one time in their lives seamstresses just like her grandmothers. Her grandmothers were very independent (in their own way) and strong women. I can see how Adriana looked up to them and emulates them in her own life.The first three chapters were written in a different style than the rest of the book. So much so that I stopped halfway through and went back to the first couple of chapters and made sure I wasn't dreaming it. I liked the little vignettes around a piece of advice from one of the grandmothers better than just straight prose. I can see how in order to fill in the reader on her grandmothers' upbringing straight prose worked the best. Adriana shared how different philosophies she learned from her grandmothers' applied to her own life. At times I felt the \"applications\" were forced and didn't flow with the rest of the chapter. I appreciated the family photos throughout the chapters as well.The initial story in the afterword was very touching, but I felt the rest of the afterword again didn't \"fit\" into the tone of the rest of the book. Maybe I had different expectations for this book. Adriana is a great storyteller, which I knew from the in-person talks I've seen in the past, but I felt the book didn't flow as best as it could have. I would recommend this book to readers that have looked up to their grandmothers and emulated them in their own life."}, {"userName": "Margarette", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3361126-margarette", "userReview": "I've loved Trigiana's work since her fictional Big Stone Gap series, the first of which I pre-ordered because I had lived in the area as a child and couldn't wait to read the book. Her novels always focus on family relationships, but in this book the focus is on her wonderful real-life grandmothers. Both came from Italy to the U.S. with little education and little money, but learned from their experiences and became fountains of wisdom. They shared that wisdom with the author, in words and actions, and she lives by their teachings long after they've been gone.The grandmothers were amazing women and I adored their stories. They would have been a 5 star book. Unfortunately toward the end of the book, the author started giving her own advice and I was nearly bored to tears. In her defense, most of her advice is on child rearing and I'm well past that stage of my life. Readers with young children may appreciate those final chapters.Overall the book is well worth reading and I would recommend it to anyone."}, {"userName": "Andrea", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3205000-andrea", "userReview": "I kept thinking, what's the point? Her grandmothers' lives were interesting, but how were they different from all the other young Italian immigrants who struggled to make it here? I think this book would have been a lot more effective if it were written in novel form and from the grandmothers' points of view.

Well unfortunately I was disappointed with this book of \"advice\". It's a fairly charming concept to write about lessons learned from your two smart, strong, Italian grandmothers. But this fell quite flat for me. The author idealizes her grandmothers, which is a normal and sweet thing to do, but many parts of the book elicited an eye-roll for me. I just felt that the novel did not execute well the personal sharing & sentiment. Many times the wisdom she was conveying was problematic and the author presented nearly everything as perfect. The advice ranged from obvious (save money! pay your bills! wear classic pieces that don't go out of style! be healthy and polite! ambition is good!), irrelevant (\"walk everywhere, don't even bother with a car\"--this really depends on where you live, particularly if you live in the States where cities are designed for cars rather than pedestrians), problematic (\"The slim figure is best\" ?! \"You are your good reputation\"? I'm pretty sure we are not always what others think of us...) to downright offensive...long explanation on one example of this below.  \"Engrave the souls of your children, not your body. It would seem that our bodies, in their natural state, are not fascinating enough. The parts must be assigned meaning. If you don't find the curve of your ankle particularly enthralling, you can tattoo it with your choice of Chinese symbols, which will be permanently engraved on your body by a man with a gold tooth who wears goggles as he operates an electric needle that spurts India ink into your flesh. Now your ankle is saying something, in addition to holding you up as your walk...The last thing you want is a boring elbow a plain forearm, or a hip without instructions. Freckles, moles, and scars are pass\u00e9; bring on the Sanskrit, emblazoned across your torso like a menu from a fast food joint in Bangladesh. These days we have a need to make whatever we were born with our version of better, and in so doing, leave our permanent wisdom carved on our bodies and not engraved on the souls of our children\" I was shocked when I read this part of the book. And not in a good way. I have a thing about finishing every book I start but that excerpt really tested me. I don't even have tattoos or plans to get any but I find everything about this incredibly problematic. What is with the disdainful and condescending tone towards people who choose to get tattoos and their reasoning for it? What is with the bizarre description/generalization of tattoo artists?Is the author assuming that all who choose tattoos do so because they find their body boring? The author felt no need to acknowledge other motivations might exist? Is the author suggesting those with tattoos are not able to share wisdom with their children?Anyways so that was a long review for a short book that wasn't really worth reading."}, {"userName": "Michele Casper", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1961874-michele-casper", "userReview": "Adriana Trigiani was a favorite author of my daughter's mother-in-law who passed away (too soon) in 2015. She was a warm, caring and classy person who lost her husband when her children were young and raised them by herself. I asked for (and received) some of her books when her family went through her things. The books I got were some novels from the Valentine series. Trigiani has written a whole lot of books and is a very well-loved author, but I personally didn't love the Valentine stories. Though the writing is beautifully descriptive and detailed, the plots (to me) seem a bit romance-novelish--but that's just me. This book, however, which contains recollections of the author's two Italian grandmothers, is a very nice read. It is full of the old-school wisdom of strong women who worked hard and uncomplainingly lived out the lives allotted them. One of them was widowed young and had to provide for her children and raise them alone, just as did the woman mentioned above. They took care of things and valued what they had--especially their families.Trigiani says: \"You only ever need one person who lights up [the way my grandmother did] when you enter a room. One person is all it takes to give a kid confidence\" and \"There is never enough time with someone you love. Ever.\"And this is one of my favorite things one of her grandmothers (who always went went to funerals, whether she liked the person or not) said: \"There is nothing we can say to comfort the grieving, but there is definitely something we can do. We can show up . . . of all the places you'll go , never miss a funeral . . . everybody should have a standing-room only funeral.\" Love this!And by the way--I was desperately looking for something to read on a flight and picked up another of Trigiani's novels, this time from the Big Stone Gap series. It's a light read, but I enjoyed its humor and story line. It has lots of quirky characters.

In Don't Sing at the Table, this much-beloved writer has gathered their estimable life lessons, revealing how her grandmothers' simple values have shaped her own life, sharing the experiences, humor, and wisdom of her beloved mentors to delight readers of all ages.   Lucia Spada Bonicelli (Lucy) and Yolanda Perin Trigiani (Viola) lived through the twentieth century from beginning to end as working women who juggled careers and motherhood. From the factory line to the family table, Lucy and Viola, the very definition of modern women, cut a path for their granddaughter by demonstrating moxie and pluck in their fearless approach to life, love, and overcoming obstacles.   Lucy's and Viola's traditions and spiritual fortitude will encourage you to hold on to the values that make life rich and beautiful. Their entrepreneurial spirit will inspire you to take risks and reap the rewards. And their remarkable resilience in the face of tragedy will be a source of strength and comfort.   Trigiani visits the past to seek answers to the essential questions that define the challenges women face today at work and at home. This is a primer, grand-mother to granddaughter, filled with everyday wisdom and life lessons that are truly \"tiramisu for the soul\" (The Examiner), handed down with care and built to last.", "title": "Don't Sing at the Table: Life Lessons from My Grandmothers", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6906388-don-t-sing-at-the-table", "average": 3.64, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1442546090l/6906388.jpg", "reviews": 288, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9219.Adriana_Trigiani", "name": "Adriana Trigiani"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Autobiography", "Biography"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6906388-don-t-sing-at-the-table", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9561880-don-t-sing-at-the-table", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13621335-don-t-sing-at-the-table", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6906386-don-t-sing-at-the-table", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9564620-don-t-sing-at-the-table", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9331838-don-t-sing-at-the-table", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13127599-the-shoemaker-s-wife", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58822.Big_Stone_Gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52471.Big_Cherry_Holler", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60057.Lucia_Lucia", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3673357-very-valentine"]}
