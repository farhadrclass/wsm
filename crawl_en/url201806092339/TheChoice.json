I was not familiar with Dr. Eger prior to reading this, and I am grateful to her for sharing her story. The book is organized into four sections: Prison, Escape, Freedom, and Healing. I would describe it as three parts memoir, one part therapy. It would be enough, simply for nanogeneraian Dr. Eger to tell us her story and share the important events she witnessed in her lifetime. But she is not satisfied to make this book only about her experience. She is clearly a committed therapist who understands pain and forgiveness uniquely, and has a very powerful message that to truly live a full life, we need to make the choice not only to forgive, but to forgive ourselves.I describe the book as pitch-perfect because from the introduction, Dr. Eger explains that there is no heirarchy when it comes to suffering. She does not tell her story so that the reader will minimize their own suffering in comparison, that would just be another way of judging ourselves. As a therapist, she understands that someone whose suffering may seem superficial to others, is generally attributed to something much more deeply rooted, and representative of a much larger pain. I find it extraordinary that she is capable of empathizing with others to this extent. When you read her story, and I hope you do, you will understand the extent of her personal suffering. Not only what she endured in her youth, but as an adult coming to terms with everything she lost, and finding a way to let it be her strength, instead of imagining what her life would have been had it not been interrupted by the cruelty and injustice of the Holocaust. I can not find the words to describe the depth of her compassion. Life is about choices, and I am guilty of the destructive thinking that Dr. Eger drescribes in the book. In my Midewestern upbringing, I was raised to take responsibility for my choices. I pride myself in this responsibility. What this book has made me realize that often in my experience, this has been a punishing idea - there are choices, and there are consequences. But life is not that simple, there are choices and more choices. Often we choose to punish ourselves. In doing so, we are imprisoning ourselves with our own beliefs - of not feeling worthy, a fear of making a bad choice... The author is open about choices she made in her own life, and that they may not have been the best ones. Everyone suffers. Everyone has endured the consequences of their own poor choices. But to live our best life, we must continue to make choices, instead of allowing ourselves to be imprisoned by our past. Thank you, Dr. Edith Eva Eger for sharing your story and your wisdom. Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for providing me with an advance copy of The Choice for review."}, {"userName": "Samantha", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21527825-samantha", "userReview": "I will admit that I did not expect to enjoy this book. I thought it was going to be another holocaust memoir with a hint of psychological analysis. But man, was I wrong.This book was beautifully written, and was a struggle to put down every night. This book was a small exercise in self-help, disguised as a gorgeous memoir. The Choice has genuinely made me change how I think about life. I would highly recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Ruth O'hagan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22047833-ruth-o-hagan", "userReview": "This was one of the most beautiful and inspiring books I have ever read. Edith tells the story her extraordinary. The main premise of the book is how she highlights her extraordinary experience as a Holocaust survivor and the how she learned to heal herself. Edith gently takes the reader by the hand vividly guides the reader on a journey of her past and present through this book. The most compelling section of the book is when she retells her experience in the concentration camps. She explains it with such bravery and strength. It was heartbreaking to hear what she went through. The strength that she showed is otherworldly. Also, compassion that she shows throughout the book is truly inspiring. She doesn't just show compassion for the Nazi's but also the compassion she shows for herself. I recommend this book for so many reasons. It's a coming of age story and how our family can affect our self esteem and how we view ourselves. Edith demonstrates that family is where we learn how to value our self-worth and the personal expectations we set for ourself's. Edith does explain the holocaust but that is not what the book is mainly about. The book is about healing and how we can love to learn to love ourselves through our challenges. Similar to Viktor Frank's, Man's search for meaning, Edith explains how love and a hunger for learning/purpose helped her survive her the holocaust."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20608600-laura", "userReview": "An uplifting and powerful lifetime memoir documenting not only the authors experience in Auschwitz but also the longer term recovery, both physically and psychologically. This was an unexpected read in the sense that I anticipated much of the book to be focused on wartime; when in actual fact, only the first third was. The latter parts of the book focus on the authors personal life as she nurtured a family and works as a psychologist. This was different to many books of a similar genre but I enjoyed it all the same. The authors account of returning to Auschwitz as a middle aged woman are particularly moving, as is her descriptions of speeches and workshops she gave to future generations. A must read for those interested in World War Two history."}, {"userName": "Maria Jo\u00e3o Trindade", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9985930-maria-jo-o-trindade", "userReview": "No words to describe this.

I generally avoid books about WWII and concentrations camps, their horrors too much for me to contemplate. Yet, I felt compelled to read this book. The reason being that from the description I gathered this was about a woman who had survived and gone on to use her strength to help others with their trauma.No, this was not an easy read. When she takes us into Auschwitz and tells us about the horrors she had seen and experienced there, my heart shrank in compassion and shame that humanity can be so cruel. But I also felt her courage and that of her sister, of the hardships and mental strength they must have had to survive when it may have been easier to give up.I realised that being liberated from a prison does not mean the prison is gone. It can live on inside us. Dr Eger\u2019s story of finally recognising and battling the prison in her mind is incredibly brave. I greatly respect and admire her for using her strength and harrowing experiences to help others deal with the prisons they had created for themselves, whatever the reason. She helps without judging.Yes, this books tells of a survivor\u2019s story, but it tells so much more about the strength and power that lives inside all of us and that we can help ourselves with the right guidance.I would thoroughly recommend this book to everyone, whether you are struggling with your own demons or not."}, {"userName": "Claudia S.

No hay nada que haga que mi dolor sea mejor o peor que el tuyo, no existe ninguna gr\u00e1fica en la que podamos plasmar la importancia relativa de un pesar respecto a otro.\"\nRese\u00f1a completa en el blog: http://mdmemories.blogspot.com/2018/0...No suelo leer libros de no ficci\u00f3n, pero siempre estoy dispuesta a leer historias profundas e importantes que me hagan cambiar la perspectiva de las cosas. Agradezco a la vida y a la editorial por poner este libro en mi camino. Ha sido retador, sorpresivo y duro, pero vale much\u00edsimo la pena el viaje lector emprendido. Su historia cambia vidas y de ahora en adelante ser\u00e1 uno de mis libros favoritos que recomendar\u00e9 a todo quien desee conocer el testimonio de una sobreviviente al Holocausto, quien con su historia quiere ayudar a quienes hayan sufrido p\u00e9rdidas en sus vidas y deseen superar el pasado.Edith Eger fue una sobreviviente de una de las peores tragedias de la humanidad. A los diecis\u00e9is a\u00f1os fue enviada al campo de exterminio de Auschwitz por ser jud\u00eda, y donde fue testigo de la muerte de sus padres en las c\u00e1maras de gas. Ella y su hermana no murieron, pero sab\u00edan que cada d\u00eda la muerte era una posibilidad. Edith era una gimnasta y bailarina, y fue eso lo que le dio la oportunidad de seguir con vida y que el doctor Josef Mengele, el nazi que las encerr\u00f3, no las matara. Pero de ah\u00ed en adelante su existencia estuvo marcada por el hambre, la enfermedad, la explotaci\u00f3n laboral, el agotamiento, el maltrato y el odio. Logr\u00f3 sobrevivir a duras penas. Este libro es su testimonio y a la vez, un regalo para la humanidad.Actualmente es una psic\u00f3loga muy reconocida que se dedica a ayudar a pacientes que sufren de victimizaci\u00f3n o que no han podido superar p\u00e9rdidas pasadas. Personas que fueron como ella. Su dolor no termin\u00f3 en Auschwitz. La acompa\u00f1\u00f3 durante mucho tiempo, los flashbacks siguen ah\u00ed, tiene crisis de vez en cuando y sabe que es algo con lo que tendr\u00e1 que vivir para siempre. Pero dedica su vida a ayudar a otros, y eso es de admirar.En este libro inicia cont\u00e1ndole al lector c\u00f3mo era su vida durante la guerra y c\u00f3mo fue su vida cautiva en Auschwitz siendo s\u00f3lo una adolescente. No es f\u00e1cil leer lo que nos narra. Pensar que todo ocurri\u00f3 en la realidad y lo estamos leyendo de primera mano por alguien que estuvo f\u00edsicamente en el lugar, es bastante fuerte y dif\u00edcil. Puedes sentir el hambre, la injusticia, el odio, el olor de las monta\u00f1as de cad\u00e1veres y el cansancio de tanto caminar. Nos explica detalladamente todas las atrocidades que vivi\u00f3, las veces que estuvo a punto de morir y el esqueleto en el que se convirti\u00f3 a falta de comida. Est\u00e1 escrito maravillosamente, pero narrando los actos m\u00e1s crueles que ha vivido el hombre. \"Aqu\u00ed el asesinato es eficiente. Sistem\u00e1tico.\" Luego de su liberaci\u00f3n por los soldados estadounidenses, la autora nos cuenta c\u00f3mo trata de recuperar su vida, a pesar de no darse cuenta que retener sus sentimientos y no hablar de ello, no es la mejor forma de avanzar. De ah\u00ed en adelante empieza su proceso de curaci\u00f3n, de liberaci\u00f3n ya no f\u00edsica, pero s\u00ed espiritual. Al ser psic\u00f3loga nos narra acerca de los testimonios y sesiones de terapia con muchos de sus pacientes, en quienes ella se ve reflejada, y nos explica el origen de la angustia y el dolor de todos ellos siendo una experta en el tema. Es muy interesante y educativo conocer las consecuencias de la p\u00e9rdida en diversas circunstancias. Adem\u00e1s relaciona su historia con la historia de sus pacientes, acompa\u00f1\u00e1ndola en su auto-descubrimiento y curaci\u00f3n. Ella aprendi\u00f3 con ellos a superar sus traumas. El lector podr\u00e1 encontrar en el libro la mejor manera para dejar, si es su caso, el dolor del pasado atr\u00e1s, superar las p\u00e9rdidas de todo tipo y adoptar la mejor forma de su ser en el presente. \n\"Ojal\u00e1 hubiera sabido que no era una persona da\u00f1ada, sino que estaba sufriendo las secuelas de una vida interrumpida.\"\nEste libro es un aprendizaje emocionante y profundo acerca de los sentimientos humanos y lo que es capaz de hacer a partir del dolor. Edith Eger es una mujer ejemplar, inspiradora, y no me cabe duda de que es bastante fuerte. Lo que vivi\u00f3 pudo destruirla toda su vida, le arrebataron la oportunidad de ser bailarina, pero ella decidi\u00f3 no dejar que Hitler dominara su presente ni su futuro. Es un an\u00e1lisis del alma humana, del proceso que se necesita para superar las crisis emocionales, de lo que significa ser feliz y perdonar, de la necesidad de ser libres en cuerpo y alma. Un viaje emocional que me llev\u00f3 a pensar en mis propias p\u00e9rdidas y en si de verdad he logrado superarlas. Nos recuerda que el ser humano puede sufrir muchos golpes en su vida, pero nadie puede quitarle lo que pone en su mente. Me alegra saber que Edith, a sus noventa a\u00f1os, dej\u00f3 un testimonio para toda la vida que podr\u00e1 ser le\u00eddo por las generaciones futuras. Les ayudar\u00e1 a ser valientes, a vencer la adversidad y a reconocer en \u00e9l la verdadera esencia del ser humano que no tiene que ver con el odio, si no con la comprensi\u00f3n de los sentimientos y la elecci\u00f3n de ser feliz. Soy alguien mejor luego de haber le\u00eddo su historia."}, {"userName": "Angela Smith", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2755807-angela-smith", "userReview": "This is truly an inspirational story of how the author went to Auschwitz and unlike so many others, she survived to share her story. Her story is not just about the terrible things she saw and suffered there but also how she managed to go on living after it happened and turned it in to something positive to help others going through struggles in their lives, be it PTSD, addiction, loss. The things that happened were truly horrendous but she chose to live, to survive and face her fears, even returning to Auschwitz years later to sort of lay some ghosts of her life there.The book is also about how we can deal with the hardships that life throws at us and try to make sense of them and perhaps even find peace, which only we can find from within. There is no golden promise from the author that things will necessarily be fixed, but all anyone can do is try. An aspiring account of the human spirit overcoming great evil and not letting Hitler win. Edith comes full circle when she talks to a regiment from the same division as the US soldiers that pulled her out of a pile of corpses when she was finally freed at the liberation."}, {"userName": "Pamela Fernandez", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36081020-pamela-fernandez", "userReview": "4.5"}, {"userName": "Anne-Marie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6240881-anne-marie", "userReview": "While reading this book, the tears sometimes just flowed quietly from my eyes. What one human being can do to another out of hate is just far beyond my comprehension, no matter how hard I try to find even a tiny sliver of understanding. Dr Edith Eger and her sister survived the horrors of Auschwitz and so much more, but it took her years to make peace with her stolen youth. Like her sister, Magda, once said to her; \"Hitler fucked us up for sure.\" Edith tells her story with a feisty attitude, but the sadness is always somewhere not too far from the surface. Physically she was broken by the horrors she had to endure, but she guarded her mental and spiritual freedom with fierceness. The book is not only about her survival, but also about the people she helped in her later years as psychologist. Edie is one of the few survivors still alive that can tell firsthand about the atrocities of the concentration camps.The message that run through this book like a golden thread, is that only we can free ourselves, whether we are in the prison of a bad marriage, a destructive family, a job we hate or our self-hate. We cannot always choose our destiny, but we can choose how to react to it.Edie learned that trauma is a nearly constant feeling in your gut that something is wrong or that something terrible is going to happen. She was 16 when she was sent to Auschwitz and even to this day, at 90 years old, there are still some smells, some sounds, that transport her back to Auschwitz in seconds. Men in uniform, sirens in the street. It took her a long time and a bumpy road to realise that what happened can never be forgotten and can never be changed, but that she can choose how to respond to the past. And that is also what she helped her patients to work through. Things happen in our lives that is not always our fault or we are not able to stop it or change it, but if we force these traumas, these stories or secrets of our lives, into hiding, we create our own prison. We deny ourselves the opportunity to grieve our losses, wounds and disappointments. And in denying this, we are doomed to keep on reliving them. Freedom lies in learning to cope with the memories and to gather the courage to break down the prison we created, brick by brick. If you are a survivor, of any kind, you should not ask, \"Why me?\" The only relevant question is, \"What now?\" Like Edie said, memory is sacred ground, but we must be careful that our memory does not become the place where our rage and guilt keep circling like vultures, scavenging the same old bones. For many years Edie did exactly that. She was a gymnast and ballet dancer on her way to the Olympics, when Hitler happened. She tells how the women, while at Auschwitz and constantly hungry, would cook in their heads. They would describe recipes to each other and debate about the amount of spices to put into a certain dish. Their food fantasies sustained them. This broke my heart. Edie said they were barracks artists, always creating, providing their minds with sustenance that kept them alive, kept them hopeful. Sometimes they had beauty pageants, modeling in their grey, shapeless dresses and dingy underwear. Edie's mantra became \"if I survive today, tomorrow I will be free\". And she did survive, but it took her many more years to become truly free. The physical trauma heals, but it will be many years before she begins to understand the psychological trauma she carrries with her. When she and Magda return to their hometown after the war, they are among only seventy out of fifteen thousand, from their town, that survived Auschwitz. The Nazi's didn't just murder millions of people, they murdered whole families. Edie and Magda was an anomaly, two sisters that survived together. But they lost both their parents. Hitler stole their life as it was supposed to be, from them. This is one of the biggest parts of her realiy that Edie had to make peace with. How it could have been if there was no Hitler and how it was after Hitler. Theri was a constant scream inside her; \"Hitler and Mengele chose for me! I didn't get to choose!\"It takes Edie years to realise that she did have a choice. She could choose her attitude in any given set of circumstances. That became the big turning point in her life. She realised that if we are stuck in the past with \"If only...\" we are living in a prison we created ourselves. The only place we can exercise our freedom of choice is in the present. The secret of self-acceptance is... YOU can only do what YOU can do the way YOU can do it. After almost forty years, Edie returns to Germany for the first time since the war. She almost doesn't go, but decides that if she doesn't, then Hitler won. And during this trip she decides to visit Auschwitz. This trip is another part of her own healing. I will leave it at that, so you can read for yourselves.I take these quotes with me:\"When we grieve, it's not just over what happened - we grieve also for what didn't happen.\"\"Don't inhale your anger to your chest.\"\"Times are changing and we are changing with them. We are always in the process of becoming.\"\"Time doesn't heal. It's what you do with the time. Healing is possible when we choose to release the wound, to let go of the past or the grief.\"\"It is too easy to make a prison out of our pain, out of the past. At best, revenge is useless. It can't alter what was done to us, it can't erase the wrongs we've suffered, it can't bring back the dead. At worst, revenge perpetuates the cycle of hate. It keeps the hate circling on and on. When we seek revenge, even non-violent revenge, we are revolving, not evolving. Each of us has the capacity to hate and the capacity to love. Which one we reach for, is up to us.\"And finally: \"You can't change what happened, you can't change what you did or what was done to you in the past. But you can choose how you live NOW.\""}, {"userName": "Christine Fay", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12983235-christine-fay", "userReview": "Dr. Eger writes succinctly and passionately about enduring the horrors of the Holocaust and interweaving the stories of others who endured similar traumas and tragedies. Think of Elie Wiesel\u2019s Night, and then multiply that by ten, and you\u2019ve got this book. It\u2019s a story of hope when all seems hopeless.

It\u2019s a story that when read, makes us a little more human, a little more intelligent, and a little more empathetic toward the human condition.\u201cOften, the little upsets in our lives are emblematic of the larger losses; the seemingly insignificant worries are representative of greater pain\u201d (9).\u201cIt took me many decades to discover that I could come at my life with a different question: Not: Why did I live? But: What is min to do with the life I\u2019ve been given?\u201d (19).\u201cIf I had to name my therapy I\u2019d probably call it Choice Therapy, as freedom is about CHOICE \u2013 about choosing compassion, humor, optimism, intuition, curiosity, and self-expression.

It was a well I could draw on, a deep source of understanding and intuition about my patients, their pain and their path to healing\u201d (219).\u201cWork has set me free. I survived so that I could do my work. Not the work the Nazis meant \u2013 the hard labor of sacrifice and hunger, of exhaustion and enslavement. It was the inner work.

I am free\u201d (233).\u201cCarlos had embraced his power to stand up and speak his truth at the risk of being excluded and criticized. He had chosen not to be a victim. And he had taken a moral stand. He had acted in alignment with a higher purpose: to combat racism, to protect human dignity. In defending his own humanity, he protected everyone\u2019s. He paved a way for all of us to live in keeping with our moral truth and ideals.

La mayor\u00eda sabemos ya de los horrores que se vivieron en los campos de exterminio durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial, pero Edith Eger nos cuenta m\u00e1s. Esta mujer excepcional nos transmite sus vivencias de un tiempo anterior a la guerra y lo que sigui\u00f3 a su liberaci\u00f3n, que tampoco fue un camino de rosas. Una liberaci\u00f3n, sin embargo, que fue solo f\u00edsica, pues su mente y sus emociones siguieron apresadas durante a\u00f1os hasta que, gracias a su trabajo de psic\u00f3loga y a su af\u00e1n por ayudar a los dem\u00e1s, logr\u00f3 descubrir qu\u00e9 la manten\u00eda presa y enfrentarse a ello. El libro se divide en tres partes, y es la \u00faltima la que constituye la aut\u00e9ntica \u201cautoayuda\u201d, pero en las otras dos, las testimoniales, mezcla a veces el relato de su pasado con lo que aprendi\u00f3 despu\u00e9s, regal\u00e1ndonos perlas de sabidur\u00eda propia y otras de pura psicolog\u00eda, como la diferencia entre \u201cvictimismo\u201d y \u201cvictimizaci\u00f3n\u201d, por ejemplo, as\u00ed que recomiendo leer (o escuchar) la obra de principio a fin.

Seguramente ya sabr\u00e9is lo mucho que me gusta la novela hist\u00f3rica, m\u00e1s a\u00fan las que se ambientan en la Segunda Guerra Mundial, pero si a todo eso le a\u00f1adimos que esta est\u00e1 basada en hechos reales tened por seguro que la voy a leer. Et voil\u00e0! La editorial me cedi\u00f3 un ejemplar y hoy vengo a contaros mis impresiones, aunque os adelanto que las frases que aparecen en la portada son totalmente ciertas y no est\u00e1n ah\u00ed por rellenar hueco ;) La novela se nos presenta narrada en primera persona desde el punto de vista de Edith, protagonista y autora de esta historia. Historia que arranca con el vivo recuerdo de una fotograf\u00eda: la propia Edith, su hermana Magda y su madre Ilonka cogidas del brazo, desoladas y haciendo cola en una larga fila sin saber qu\u00e9 les espera y sin saber si esa ser\u00e1 la \u00faltima vez que se vean. Desde el mismo momento en el que Magda y Edith se enteran de la muerte de sus padres en la c\u00e1mara de gas junto a otros cientos \u2014y miles\u2014 de jud\u00edos, entrar\u00e1n en una continua lucha por la supervivencia. \u00abSi sobrevivo hoy, ma\u00f1ana ser\u00e9 libre\u00bb, piensan. Y s\u00ed, sobreviven, pero siempre quedar\u00e1n traumas, heridas y cicatrices que nunca se curar\u00e1n ni desaparecer\u00e1n. Historias y recuerdos que permanecer\u00e1n en su memoria y en la de todos los supervivientes hasta el fin de sus d\u00edas.Ser\u00eda pr\u00e1cticamente imposible mencionar a todos los personajes, tanto principales como secundarios, que aparecen en esta historia porque son much\u00edsimos, pero s\u00ed me gustar\u00eda destacar y recordar a los m\u00e1s importantes: los padres de Edith, sus hermanas Magda y Clara, B\u00e9la (el que, tras terminar la guerra y reconstruir un poco su vida, se convertir\u00e1 en su marido y en su bote salvavidas), Lester e Imre (dos hermanos que tambi\u00e9n sobreviven a la guerra) y Laci (otro superviviente al que Magda conocer\u00e1 con el tiempo).Como el propio t\u00edtulo indica, Edith quer\u00eda ser bailarina profesional, pero poco antes de estallar la guerra fue expulsada del equipo ol\u00edmpico por el simple hecho de ser jud\u00eda, as\u00ed que vio su sue\u00f1o truncado cuando a\u00fan era muy joven aunque nunca dej\u00f3 a un lado su amor por la danza. Y jam\u00e1s hubiese pensado que eso mismo ser\u00eda lo que la salvar\u00eda de la muerte, pues lleg\u00f3 a o\u00eddos del doctor Josef Mengele \u2014el \u00e1ngel de la muerte\u2014 que era una muy buena bailarina, as\u00ed que un d\u00eda la oblig\u00f3 a que bailase para \u00e9l por mero entretenimiento.Y bueno... podr\u00eda estar horas y horas cont\u00e1ndoos cosas sobre Edith, tanto de periodos anteriores a la guerra como posteriores, pero se har\u00eda muy larga y aburrida la rese\u00f1a y esa no es mi intenci\u00f3n. Normalmente acostumbro a hablaros un poco de los personajes, pero al ser esta una novela basada en hechos reales, los personajes traspasan el papel y se convierten en personas de carne y hueso, personas que han vivido y sobrevivido a una de las \u00e9pocas m\u00e1s convulsas de nuestra historia, aunque tambi\u00e9n se da voz y visibilidad a los que, por desgracia, no lo lograron =/Es por eso mismo por lo que esta vez no puedo hablar de personajes bien construidos y trabajados o de personajes cercanos y humanos; pero s\u00ed puedo hablaros de personas valientes, de personas que dieron su vida y hasta su \u00faltimo aliento luchando por algo que les pertenec\u00eda: su dignidad. Y es que se cuentan tantas y tan crueles historias y experiencias que ponen los pelos de punta, entristecen y enfurecen, pero tambi\u00e9n nos regalan un sinf\u00edn de lecciones que ayudan a los personajes a ver un puntito de luz al final del t\u00fanel.La novela no cuenta con una trama propiamente dicha, sino que est\u00e1 dividida en cuatro partes: la prisi\u00f3n, la huida, la libertad y la curaci\u00f3n. En cada una de ellas, el lector seguir\u00e1 los pasos de la mano de la propia Edith y se meter\u00e1 en su piel de tal manera que sentir\u00e1 lo mismo que ella.A pesar de esas cuatro divisiones, yo he sentido que la novela estaba dividida en dos grandes bloques. Por un lado tendr\u00edamos la parte personal, donde Edith nos cuenta su experiencia antes, durante y despu\u00e9s de la guerra y de Auschwitz. Y por otro lado tendr\u00edamos la parte psicol\u00f3gica, donde nos cuenta las experiencias personales que vivi\u00f3 con los pacientes a los que ayud\u00f3 (que por si no lo sab\u00edais, Edith Eger se licenci\u00f3 en en Psicolog\u00eda Cl\u00ednica d\u00e9cadas despu\u00e9s de terminar la guerra) y la forma en que esas experiencias la ayudaron a ella misma para salir adelante.Esta novela, que se mueve entre la biograf\u00eda y autoayuda, no pretende ser una mera descripci\u00f3n de hechos y acontecimientos que sucedieron durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial, sino un c\u00famulo de experiencias personales tanto de gente que sufri\u00f3 la guerra como de gente que no estuvo relacionada con ella pero aun as\u00ed necesitaban la ayuda de Edith para guiarles hacia su propia libertad.Como es obvio, leer esta novela supone enfrentarte a historias muy duras y crueles, pero tambi\u00e9n supone aprender much\u00edsimas cosas al lado de Edith Eger, as\u00ed que no puedo sino recomendaros su lectura si os gustan este tipo de novelas, pues como reza en la propia portada: \u00abEste libro es un regalo para la humanidad. Una de esas historias que nunca quieres terminar de leer y que te cambian la vida para siempre\u00bb. Y s\u00ed, no podr\u00eda describir de otra manera lo que \u00abLa bailarina de Auschwitz\u00bb ha supuesto para m\u00ed.He sentido rabia e impotencia en much\u00edsimas ocasiones, aunque tambi\u00e9n pena, mucha pena. A medida que iba descubriendo la historia de Edith y la de todos los que pasaron por lo mismo que ella, me fui dando cuenta de que por culpa de la ambici\u00f3n pol\u00edtica de unos pocos entraron en guerra pa\u00edses enteros y fueron muchos los inocentes que sufrieron las consecuencias. Y ya ni hablemos de los prejuicios hacia los jud\u00edos sin un motivo aparente y las barbaridades que sufrieron por el simple hecho de ser jud\u00edos. Claro que tambi\u00e9n tuve momentos de alegr\u00eda y felicidad aunque, por desgracia, no hubo tantos como me hubiese gustado :')Y si he podido sentir todo eso y m\u00e1s ha sido gracias a la pluma de la autora, pues escribe de una forma tan cercana y directa que es imposible no empatizar con ella y con todas las historias y experiencias que nos regala. Se sirve de frases breves y concisas que de igual modo llegan al lector de forma directa y a m\u00ed no ha podido gustarme m\u00e1s su forma de escribir.A pesar de que muchos de los cap\u00edtulos no eran precisamente cortos (algunos incluso superaban las veinte p\u00e1ginas), en ning\u00fan momento se me hizo pesada ni aburrida, por lo que el ritmo de lectura es bastante \u00e1gil y os aseguro que a m\u00ed me ten\u00eda completamente sumergida y enganchada porque, entre otras cosas, el tema o temas que trata me interesan much\u00edsimo y nunca es suficiente. El final de la novela vino cargado de emociones y sentimientos, de ilusiones y agradecimientos. Despu\u00e9s de lo mucho que cambi\u00f3 la vida de Edith despu\u00e9s de la guerra y de grabarse a fuego en mi mente que, tal y como recoge la novela, Auschwitz y cualquier campo de concentraci\u00f3n eran f\u00e1bricas de muerte creadas por el hombre, las palabras de esta gran mujer han logrado calarme hondo y su historia quedar\u00e1 siempre conmigo. Y termino la rese\u00f1a diciendo que el mundo necesita m\u00e1s personas como Edith Eger :')Pod\u00e9is leer la rese\u00f1a completa en el blog: http://papillons-dans-le-ciel-bleu.bl..."}, {"userName": "Lou", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3699303-lou", "userReview": "The ballerina that got away and helped others in troubles to have a second or third choice in life. Some sentences shock, potent prose of hauntingly retelling in the memoir part, and then her forbearingness, compassion, and great advising in the helping others part of this work.She tells, the author Dr. Edith Eva Eger, of her days vividly, from her darkest days of captivity from Factory to factory, loaded from Train to train and then Shower of one kind cleansing to another of dread, a shower of killing, ultimately from Captivity to survival and living on with resilience, hope and forwardness, and choices to be bigger, greater than her parents could ever want, in helping others in their captivity of all kinds of pains and darkness, to breathing and walking out of their domain into some light, some chance for choice of a better kind, a pursuit of a happiness, a betterment.The authors writing has a melody to telling something so terrible, her voice potent and visceral has you hanging with heartbeat in her place, in her terror of those days past, all evoked before the reader. These brutal facts heard of before, seen on screen, but for me not read in a book before with such great vivid telling and craft in writing coupled with a voice compelling and compassionate.A work of accountabilities and choices, and freeing yourself from captivity within, whatsoever the pain, whatsoever the darkness passeth, and continue on.A must read that will be in best and highly recommended reads lists of 2017.In the foreword Philip Zimbardo PhD writes a fitting account of this work: \"The Choice is an extraordinary chronicle of heroism and healing, resiliency and compassion, survival with dignity, mental toughness, and moral courage. All of us can learn from Dr. Eger\u2019s inspiring cases and riveting personal story to heal our own lives.\"\u00a0Excerpts from introduction:What happened can never be forgotten and can never be changed. But over time I learned that I can choose how to respond to the past. I can be miserable, or I can be hopeful, I can be depressed or I can be happy. We always have that choice, that opportunity for control.Freedom lies in learning to embrace what happened. Freedom means we muster the courage to dismantle the prison, brick by brick.Bad things, I am afraid, happen to everyone. This we can\u2019t change. If you look at your birth certificate, does it say life will be easy? It does not. But so many of us remain stuck in a trauma or grief, unable to experience our lives fully. This we can change.My own search for freedom and my years of experience as a licensed clinical psychologist have taught me that suffering is universal. But victimhood is optional. There is a difference between victimization and victimhood. We are all likely to be victimized in some way in the course of our lives. At some point we will suffer some kind of affliction or calamity or abuse, caused by circumstances or people or institutions over which we have little or no control. This is life. And this is victimization. It comes from the outside. It\u2019s the neighborhood bully, the boss who rages, the spouse who hits, the lover who cheats, the discriminatory law, the accident that lands you in the hospital. In contrast, victimhood comes from the inside. No one can make you a victim but you. We become victims not because of what happens to us but when we choose to hold on to our victimization. We develop a victim\u2019s mind\u2014a way of thinking and being that is rigid, blaming, pessimistic, stuck in the past, unforgiving, punitive, and without healthy limits or boundaries. We become our own jailors when we choose the confines of the victim\u2019s mind.Whether you\u2019re in the dawn or noon or late evening of your life, whether you\u2019ve seen deep suffering or are only just beginning to encounter struggle, whether you\u2019re falling in love for the first time or losing your life partner to old age, whether you\u2019re healing from a life-altering event or in search of some little adjustments that could bring more joy to your life, I would love to help you discover how to escape the concentration camp of your own mind and become the person you were meant to be. I would love to help you experience freedom from the past, freedom from failures and fears, freedom from anger and mistakes, freedom from regret and unresolved grief\u2014and the freedom to enjoy the full, rich feast of life.What follows is the story of the choices, big and small, that can lead us from trauma to triumph, from darkness to light, from imprisonment to freedom.Excerpts:Memory is sacred ground. But it\u2019s haunted too. It\u2019s the place where my rage and guilt and grief go circling like hungry birds scavenging the same old bones. It\u2019s the place where I go searching for the answer to the unanswerable question: Why did I survive?First the high kick. Then the pirouette and turn. The splits. And up. As I step and bend and twirl, I can hear Mengele talking to his assistant. He never takes his eyes off me, but he attends to his duties as he watches. I can hear his voice over the music. He discusses with the other officer which ones of the hundred girls present will be killed next. If I miss a step, if I do anything to displease him, it could be me. I dance. I dance. I am dancing in hell. I can\u2019t bear to see the executioner as he decides our fates. I close my eyes.We were sent to the showers every day at Auschwitz, and every shower was fraught with uncertainty. We never knew whether water or gas would stream out of the tap.Our skin hardly covers our bones. We are an anatomy lesson. Elbows, knees, ankles, cheeks, knuckles, ribs jut out like questions. What are we now? Our bones look obscene, our eyes are caverns, blank, dark, empty. Hollow faces. Blue-black fingernails. We are trauma in motion. We are a slow-moving parade of ghouls. We stagger as we walk, our carts roll over the cobblestones. Row on row, we fill the square in Wels, Austria. Townspeople stare at us from windows. We are frightening. No one speaks. We choke the square with our silence. Townspeople run into their homes. Children cover their eyes. We have lived through hell only to become someone else\u2019s nightmare.All of the survivors I met had one thing in common with me and with each other: We had no control over the most consuming facts of our lives, but we had the power to determine how we experienced life after trauma. Survivors could continue to be victims long after the oppression had ended, or they could learn to thrive. In my dissertation research, I discovered and articulated my personal conviction and my clinical touchstone: We can choose to be our own jailors, or we can choose to be free.\u201cMy mama told me something I will never forget,\u201d I began. \u201cShe said, \u2018We don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, but no one can take away from you what you put in your own mind.\u2019 \u201d I have said these words countless times, to Navy SEALs and crisis first responders, to POWs and their advocates at the Department of Veterans Affairs, to oncologists and people living with cancer, to Righteous Gentiles, to parents and children, to Christians and Muslims and Buddhists and Jews, to law students and at-risk youth, to people grieving the loss of a loved one, to people preparing to die, and sometimes I spin when I say them, with gratitude, with sorrow.https://more2read.com/review/choice-edith-eva-eger/"}, {"userName": "Theut", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9169945-theut", "userReview": "Mi aspettavo un libro diverso (ma non per questo sono rimasta delusa): non pensavo che la vita dell'autrice avesse tanta parte all'interno dell'economia del libro.

Separated from her mother and father, who were sent straight to their deaths, she and her sister were forced into horrible circumstances where every choice made for them could have life-ending consequences. Through the years, as she went on with her life, immigrated to America and became a clinical Psychiatrist, she has discovered how every person has the choice on how to internally deal with the circumstances they are presented. There is no way to accurately sum up this book, or how it deeply it effected me. As we come closer to the point in time when there are no longer any Holocaust survivors, we need more of these stories, more of these reminders of what the human race is capable of, both of evil and of strength. The first two-thirds of this book is memoir while the last is more about her practice of Psychiatry and her clients. I really think everyone should give this a read and I'm already wondering if it is on Oprah's radar.

On the one hand, it's a memoir of Edith Eger's life, not just how she survived being sent to Auschwitz at the age of 16 with her parents and sister Magda, but also how she coped with her life afterwards, and the guilt of surviving when her parents and so many others were murdered. On the other, it's a book that the reader can find inspiration in for their own lives. After emigrating to America, Edith Eger became a psychologist and went on to help other people with their traumas and emotional problems, whilst still trying to understand her own.What is truly different about this book is that, despite the fact that the author went through such unimaginable horror, she still remains so positive and optimistic about life. She learns from her patients as well as helping them. At times this isn't an easy story to read - but it doesn't wallow in the macabre, and ultimately it is life-affirming.

Some have said that, when life hands you a lemon, make lemonade. But Dr. Eger has made a lemon souffl\u00e9. I work with patients who have traumatic histories, and find that often they are so enmeshed in their past pain that they cannot move past it, nor are they able to put it out of their memory by accepting that it is past, cannot be changed, and the only direction to move is forward. But that is a message that many cannot process. I have found also that for some patients, hearing an inspiring story does not give them more courage, but rather they feel discounted or take it as a personal failure that they cannot move forward as this other very brave person has done. It is abundantly evident that Dr. Eger is an extraordinarily gifted individual, and for those fortunate enough to work with her toward their own healing, they are blessed. So, I would tell patients about this book, and suggest they might find inspiration in it; those who can accept this exceptional story and choose to follow the lessons it offers might be very much helped by it.My thanks to author, publisher, and NetGalley for providing a copy of this book to read and review."}, {"userName": "Abc", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45993514-abc", "userReview": "Un libro che tutti dovrebbero leggere perch\u00e9 trasmette degli insegnamenti interessanti su come affrontare i dolori che inevitabilmente la vita porta con s\u00e8.

There, she was made to dance for the infamous Josef Mengele. Her heroic actions helped her sister to survive, and her bunkmates to save her life, during a death march, after which she was found in a pile of bodies, barely alive. She recovered and moved to America, going on to become an eminent psychologist, and giving the keynote address at Viktor Frankl's 90th birthday party.Like Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning, Dr Edith Eger's important book, The Choice, could change your life.
