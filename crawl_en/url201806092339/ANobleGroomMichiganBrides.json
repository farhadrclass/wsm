Yes, me, the virtually un-impressible. And yet she does it... every single time.With that said, she doesn\u2019t have nearly enough books out! This is only her fourth published novel (with Bethany House), and in my opinion, there aren\u2019t too many authors out there who write half so well.Also, before I start in on what I loved SO MUCH about the inside of this book, I have to add that A Noble Groom has THE BEST COVER EVER. I don\u2019t often like covers with the hero of the book pictured, especially without the heroine involved at all! But this one went so well with the blurb about the book. Everything about it was perfect: the farm, the wind, the clouds, the suit, the cravat, the colors, the look on his face... everything about it matched everything inside the book to perfection.I really don\u2019t know how exactly Jody makes reading about two mismatched people working on a farm in the middle of nowhere Michigan in 1880/1881\u2014speaking German (hypothetically) to one another no less\u2014so enthralling. But like I said, she does it every time, no matter what she\u2019s writing about.I know what it is, actually. It\u2019s her characters. Their emotions are so true, their thoughts so amazingly accurate. The situations they find themselves in... so complexly and perfectly orchestrated.Both Annalisa Werner and Carl von Reichart have so much to learn throughout the pages of this book; about themselves and about each other, as well as about life in general. Although they\u2019re both German immigrants from an area called Saxony, they are from extreme opposite worlds. Annalisa is the widow of a mean-hearted peasant farmer who\u2019s family had relocated to America six years before because of the severe work conditions in Saxony... and Carl, the wrongly-accused fugitive, who happens to (secretly) be the son of the over-bearing Baron who caused the death of Annalisa\u2019s older brother, and which resulted in her entire family immigrating to America in the first place. Talk about complex! Although I did begin reading this book the first moment I had it in my grasp (and after, literally, stalking my mailman everyday waiting for it to arrive!), I did not end up reading it quickly. Partly because I simply didn't want it to end and partly because there were so many points in the book that I just had to stop reading so I could digest what all was (or at times, what wasn\u2019t!) going on within and between these two characters. There were also all of the times when I felt that all was lost, and I had no idea how Carl and Annalisa were ever going to end up together by the end of the book....Sigh. Then I finally read the last twenty percent as quickly as possible because I couldn\u2019t stand not to any longer.And then I sighed again, and again, and again. (haha, that\u2019s especially for Jody and anyone else who might have read the book already).Now every time I see the cover of the book pictured anywhere, I simply sigh and say, \u201cOh, yes... that book. That wonderful book.\u201dI blessedly received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review, and I give Jody Hedlund\u2019s A Noble Groom 5 (million) stars."}, {"userName": "Kellie", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18272395-kellie", "userReview": "Confession? It wasn\u2019t actually the story itself that grabbed my attention when this book came up as available for review. It was actually\u2026the good looking wind-blown guy on the cover. Now that I have that off my chest\u2026here\u2019s my review. *wink*Analise, a German immigrant living in rual 1880\u2019s Michigan, is suddenly left widowed with a young daughter and another child on the way. Living in a family steeped in tradition and conventionality, her father arranges a marriage with a cousin still back in Germany who wishes to immigrate to America. And so, Carl arrives. And as one would expect, a true love blossoms between the two. There\u2019s just one important detail: Carl is NOT the cousin from Germany Analise is pledged to marry. Carl is the nobleman son of Analise\u2019s father\u2019s arch-enemy and who has just escaped be-heading at the hands of a vindictive duke. Ah yes. That should make it interesting.Pros: This story has everything that we love \u2013 a young heroine who needs a knight in shining armor to not only save her livelihood but also protect her from an evil land-snatching land-owner, and a hero full of charm and who is, of course, so unlike all of the other men our heroine has ever met. We have a murder. We also a woman who needs to learn to stand up for herself. And of course, lots of times where the young man and young woman are forced to spend time alone together. Where, of course, a natural romance blossoms. One of my personal favorite story-lines from A Noble Groom, was the fact that the main female character already had children. Whereas having a heroine who is no longer a maiden might be weird for some younger readers, I have always had a fascination for that second-chance romance. There\u2019s something so precious to me about children who need another parent. And the relationship that is built between Gretchen, the 3 year old daughter of our widow, and Carl, is so very tender and sweet. Cons: other than the story-line being slightly predictable (but then, that\u2019s really the norm for any romance novel), my only bone to pick with the overall story was that at times the story seemed to drag on just a wee bit. But even then, those prolonged moments never hindered my anticipation of discovering the ending or deterred me from continuing on.Overall, I found this book enjoyable and a pleasurable read of an afternoon. While it doesn\u2019t stand out as a Top Ten Favorite, for anyone looking for a well-written story of second-chance love with a few page-turning moments, A Noble Groom by Judy Heplum might just be the book for you.Complimentary copy provided by Bethany House Publishers in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Rane", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1987431-rane", "userReview": "Jody Hedlund takes the reader on a journey in a time in the US I didn't know about, she brought it to life through her amazing writing.  In the 1880's many German immigrants make a living in rural Michigan. Breaking away from the old country they still live by much of the traditions they carried from their homeland. Analise, has struggle to make ends meat with her land and her good for nothing husband's recent death. With her father deciding who she marry next, she awaits a cousin from the old country and is surprised and leery of the stranger who ends up at her front door. Carl von Reichert is a nobleman on the run from a murder he didn't comment. In order to save his neck, she makes his way Michigan in hopes of laying low until everything is cleared up or to start a new life. As a nobleman, Carl hasn't pay attention to the commoners who work on his father's land or their strife they must endure. An inventor working on Analise farm, opens his eyes to a different side of life. Even as he comes to love Analise and her daughters, his past comes back to haunt him and it takes love and faith to break free and start anew. As a history buff, I enjoy reading about periods of time I know nothing about. It's like a surprise gift as you delve into place and people who effected us even today. Hedlund does this amazing job with early Michigan and the immigrants who came to the US to build anew. The story is at times harsh for the period of time lives in. You worked hard to survive. At the same time, their great joy when one finds one's strength.  Carl was never an unlikeable person, even when he thought he shouldn't have to dirty his hands. He's change is about the road that may lead you isn't the one you thought it would be, but is the right one you needed to be. Analise grew as well, from bending to the rules restricted by her father the men in her life and old traditions. Also learning to trust and have faith after being burned so badly before.  Carl and Analise were so amazing they didn't go off the deep end or do something \"modern\" staying true to the period of time while being amazing and overcoming their trials.  The trials from stopping a greedy man to fighting nature's own wrath, Carl and Analise strength and discovered faith never comes across as something overdone or overly preaching. It flows within the story making it a joy to read... Jody Hedlund has become a author I'm been happy to have discovered with her detail to history and her wonderful writing skills, she's become my newest to-buy author.  ..Plus this cover doesn't hurt either ;D"}, {"userName": "Casey", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3194216-casey", "userReview": "Another reader friend of mine told me she read \u201cA Noble Groom\u201d in 24 hours and I was not too far behind her. What. A. Great. Story.From the first page to the last sentence I was completely captivated by the characters, the story of their lives and the romance, oh! The romance! Stand-out writing quality made for a story I literally could not put down.I haven\u2019t fallen in love with a storybook hero in quite a few books; Carl changed that pattern. Talk about a hero to admire. Yes, he had his faults, but what impressed me is while those faults might have made any other character stuck up and unlikeable, with Carl, you knew it was only a matter of time until his transformation changed him.I can\u2019t quite profess my entire love for these characters and book in 250 words. They took over the story, made it come alive in the best possible ways. Descriptions danced across the screen of my mind as much as Gretchen did across the dry Michigan ground. My favorite moment? By far the kiss in the rain. A kiss (and many non kisses) to rival all kisses, \u201cA Noble Groom\u201d had so many unforgettable moments. It\u2019s the kind of story you think about long after that final page is turned. The kind of characters that you want to be become your best friends.

They worked hard and had little, but anything was better than what they had in the Old Country. In this book the German immigrants in Forestville are farmers. Annalisa is a young widow. Her husband was recently murdered. Now her father decided she needs a new husband and he writes to his brother in Germany to look among their family for a young man who is willing to come to America to become a farmer and to marry his daughter.Carl is the son of a duke\u2014a nobleman who is not accustomed to hard work. He was accused of murder and therefore had to flee from Germany to America. He promised to help a young widow until her groom\u2014also from Germany\u2014would arrive. He can never tell his true identity\u2014that he is the son of the duke\u2014that would probably get him killed because Annalisa\u2019s father hates Carl\u2019s father. Carl is a man of faith and finds it hard to live a lie, but feels he doesn\u2019t have much of a choice.In these days marriage was more a practical thing. Annalisa needed a man to run her farm...and soon! While waiting for her groom to arrive Carl is helping her on her farm. She can see he is different than any of the other farmers, but she is grateful for his help and doesn\u2019t ask him any questions about his life in the Old Country.Carl and Annalisa develop feelings for each other, but they know they can\u2019t get married because her father promised her to her cousin who is coming over from Germany. It is taking too long for her cousin to arrive. Will he ever show up? Or is there a chance that she can marry Carl?This was another great book by Jody Hedlund. Carl and Annalisa were very likable characters. I really enjoyed reading this book. I love Jody\u2019s story telling and I also love to learn more about American history in her books.

The book was absolutely amazing and I can't say that I have let out a sigh like that in a very long time!\"A Noble Groom\" had everything I want in a book: romance, suspense, action, and a deepness that makes you question your own thoughts. I left the book reveling in the sweetness of Annalisa and Carl's romance that is based on a love that only comes from the hand of God! Jody did such a wonderful job of weaving how the Bible portrays love should be between a man and woman as well as the role that God calls the husband and wife to have concerning towards their spouse!I also loved how Jody shows the battle and power of forgiveness! Through the different characters the reader can see that forgiveness is something that we all struggle with (especially when we have been deceived!), but once we decide to forgive their is an overwhelming freedom that comes! Overall I think the thing that hit me most about this book was that we shouldn't take for granted the love that we have from family and friends surrounding us. There will be hard times that come, but like Annalisa mentions that we can't have \"anything that was truly worthwhile without fighting for it\" such as a farm, family, or true love. These immigrants gave up everything they had and worked all day, but were encouraged by hope. They had family that was their to help them in the hard times. That is something that I want to remember and take away from this book: No matter how hard life might get at times I do not want to pass over my family with frustration or bitterness, but with a gratefulness to know I that have someone fighting with me as well as hoping.In my opinion, this is the best book I have read by Jody so far! It is so powerful and you will not be disappointed by the powerful message it brings!"}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4075354-beth", "userReview": "I love when a story takes me to a different time & place, and I really feel transported there. The descriptions of Annalisa's hardships on her farm and within the community were fully realized for me, as was the developing relationship between her and Carl. Carl Richards is actually a nobleman that ran away to America to keep his life, and though I wondered how it would come across, his transition from tinkering inventor to farmer came across as very believable. He struggled, felt pain and improved over time, and I love the dual role that working the land provided for his character. While he thought he was only helping Annalisa survive, he was also realizing what it was like to fully live, to work for something and feel the gratitude that you were able to do it with your own two hands.The plot was a great balance of danger and romance, without coming across as cheesy in either aspect, but instead they felt real and true. I loved the moments of high tension, and the swoon-worthy moments weren't bad either ;) While their relationship played a role, it didn't dominate the plot, nor did the story depend on romance to carry through until the end. Carl & Annalisa's interactions with one another were both endearing and heart-breaking and ultimately inspiring as they came to truly know each other. There were several scenes that made me chuckle too.And how refreshing to see a cover featuring a man instead of a woman! I love how there seems to be real movement, and I so pictured Carl just like this.Hedlund gained another fan with this one!

They're well-crafted, with good pacing and engaging characterization. While the premise of A Noble Groom wouldn't normally be my favorite, as I'm generally not as interested in romance stories involving children, I still found myself drawn into the characters' dilemmas and loving Carl for his care not only for Annalisa, but also for her daughter Gretchen and others. For a guy who should be quite spoiled and self-centered given his past, he learns humility rather quickly (although it takes him a frustratingly long amount of time to accept facts that are quite obvious to the reader!).Hedlund doesn't spare her characters from humiliation, heartaches, and trials, and she uses each to create a sense of authenticity and a deeper sympathy for the characters. What I especially loved about this story, though, was the atmosphere. While some of the storyline elements/events aren't new to Christian fiction (A Promise to Love by Serena B. Miller shares some similarities, although they're certainly very different stories), A Noble Groom has a unique feel, very much matching the scene and colors depicted on the cover. I love Hedlund's descriptions of the setting, as well as her intriguing balance of interesting details and great romance.All in all, I was charmed by the hero and the timely fairy-tale theme of A Noble Groom.

What a hard life those immigrants had, really, it was blood and toil and sweat and tears. The treatment of women and their lack of rights could turn me into a raving feminist.Facts about the German side are a bit topsy-turvy, though. Essen, indeed a mining and industrial centre, is nowhere near Saxony, but belonged to Prussia at the time and to my knowledge never was a desirable ducal residence - apart from the fact that Saxony had a king, not a duke, for most of the 19th century, and he had Dresden for a royal residence.All in all a gentle love story with a very likeable hero and heroine."}, {"userName": "Lisa Nelson", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5706466-lisa-nelson", "userReview": "I really enjoy Jody Hedlund's books!!She has a way of drawing you into the character's mind and heart,In this story you know how and why the characters feel and act as they do!I felt the story so intensely, it mattered so much to me that things turn out right!She does a good job of ending the story, but I enjoyed these people so much, I would like to visit them again!I'm looking forward to reading more of this author's books"}, {"userName": "JoAnn", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4850911-joann", "userReview": "Excellent book by a superlative author.

It\u2019s familiar and yet interesting and the author brings their own spin to the situation. In A Noble Groom by Jody Hedlund our familiar themes are \u201cthe fish out of water\u201d theme, (which I always happen to love) as well as the ill treated damsel in distress (perhaps a little Cinderella here). When you combine the two- you have Carl Richards (fish out of water) meeting up with new widow and mother Annalisa (Cinderella) and the two together give you a great story filled with humor, poignancy, much growth and self-discovery for both characters and of course a bit of romance (Cinderella, remember?) thrown in for good measure. I have to say that Carl is just a generally lovable character. He isn\u2019t quite who he seems to be, but shows up at just the right time to help poor widow Annalisa Werner to help her work her farm in Forestville, MIchigan to pay off her land debt or she will quite literally \u201close the farm\u201d. Carl is running from a complicated situation from his home country of Germany and seeks sanctuary from the troubles at home, as well as a job. It turns out that he is the worst farmer in the history of the world, little strength, no know-how and unaccustomed to long work hours, but he somehow manages to hang in there and learn how to help on the farm and in turn help out Annalisa. She is a new widow whose now deceased husband wasn\u2019t the best guy around and so she is unused to being around a man such as Carl. Carl is thoughtful and kind and cares about her welfare as well as her thoughts and opinions on things. The tough situation here is that Annalisa needs a new husband to run the farm and one has been arranged for her, by her father through relatives in her homeland of Germany, but this likely groom has been detained, indefinitely. And so while she waits for his arrival, she can\u2019t help but draw closer to Carl. as she watches him tend to things on the farm, laugh at himself when he constantly makes mistakes and lovingly watch out for her daughter Gretchen. I mean what woman wouldn\u2019t fall for him? But the dark cloud hanging over them was that any day \u201cthe groom\u201d would be showing up sending Carl on his way. I have to say this was \u201cthat book\u201d for me where I found myself in every last free moment running to, so that I could finish it. The characters were characters that you cared about and really were wishing the best for. Jody Hedlund did a wonderful job in slowly opening up the character of Annalisa as she was a bit closed off and downtrodden at the beginning of the story with her financial difficulties and being under her father\u2019s thumb, etc. But as the character of Carl works his magic with his kind ways and loving nature she truly becomes stronger and more open and loving. It was really neat to see that progression. Carl exemplified that person that we all should be- someone who is able to laugh at themselves when they make mistakes, someone who looks out for the interests of others and someone who learned about what it was truly like to walk a mile in someone else\u2019s shoes. He gained understanding and a deeper faith in God through his experiences on the farm. I really recommend this books for those who love a great historical fiction Christian romance. You will love the characters, how they grow from the hardships they face and how they trust God through all of it. I hope to see this book make many awards lists in the future!

Fleeing Germany in search of a better life, numerous immigrants hoped to work in the mines in Michigan's upper peninsula, but upon discovering how cold winters were that far north they remained in lower peninsula Michigan where land was cheap. Clearing the land and making it ready for planting crops was hard labor, but just owning a piece of property was important to these immigrants who came from nothing in the Old Country. Annalisa Werner's husband was killed, leaving her with a 2-year-old daughter, and pregnant with her second child. Her marriage had been unhappy, and as she told her daughter fairy tales she frequently dreamed about love and happiness in a marriage, wondering if such a thing existed. When Carl Richards arrived in Michigan from Germany, Annalisa's father mistook him for a distant cousin that he had requested as a husband for Annalisa. When Carl informed him that he was a teacher, and not Annalisa's cousin, he was hired to work Annalisa's farm until her prospective husband arrived from Germany. Jody Hedlund has researched her Michigan history well, and has created a very poignant story of extremely oppressive times for the immigrants who came from Germany with virtually nothing but their work ethics and the hope for a better life. Marriage was a matter of necessity in order to produce children to assist in working the farms. Women had no value aside from their childbearing capabilities, and love was a rarity. Strong personalities are portrayed with detail, leaving the reader affected by these characters. The landscape is described in pictorial detail, creating images that enhance the issues described in the lives of these peasants. It appears that God has forsaken these people through harsh and significantly difficult times, but their faith remains strong, and hope prevails. The attention to detail in this book is magnificent! Jody Hedlund is an extremely talented and masterful author who creates a deeply moving and emotionally consuming story of struggle, survival, faith and love.

While I didn\u2019t love A Noble Groom as much as I had thought I would, I did still really, really enjoy it.The characters were great! I absolutely loved Carl, and Annalisa\u2019s daughter, Gretchen, was so cute. There was a little bit of danger to the story, which I liked very much \u2013 it made me want to keep turning the pages.I found the whole aspect of the farm and having to work hard to try and save it very interesting. I also liked the little bit of history in the story. This is at least the second book I\u2019ve read that takes place in Michigan and a significant event that occurred in 1881, so it was interesting to get another take on it and I actually learned more about it.The few negatives: I enjoyed the whole book, but it did take me a while to get captured by the story and get to where I wanted to keep reading; I also wish there would have been a glossary or something to show what the German words meant in English; and finally, while the ending was very nice, it did leave me with some questions and I wish we would have been told how things fared for certain characters.So, I thought the first half or so was good, but loved the last 100+ pages! There was also a great twist in A Noble Groom that, while I did surprisingly guess it early on and wasn\u2019t shocked at all by the reveal, I\u2019m sure some readers will not see it coming. ;)Overall, A Noble Groom was a really nice read that I definitely recommend to fans of historical romances.

Her husband failed her in every way and now his death has left her with few options to save the family farm. She needs a plentiful harvest. That, and a husband to help bring it in. Someone strong, dependable. That'll be enough. A marriage for love...that's something she's given up on. So her father sends a letter to his brother in the Old Country, asking him to find Annalisa a groom. Then a man appears: Carl Richards, from their home country of Germany and a former schoolteacher--or so he says. He's looking for work and will serve on the farm until her husband arrives. With time running out, she accepts his help, but there's more to this man than he's admitting. He's also gentle, kind, charming--unlike any man she's ever known. But even as Carl is shining light into the darkness of her heart, she knows her true groom may arrive any day.I have reviewed books for years and I can honestly say that it is very, very rare for a book to grab me from page one and hold my attention all the way through.

Set in my home state of Michigan, it also talks about some of the history of that state, the German immigrants that settled it, and the lengths they were willing to go to save their land. Awesome book. $14.99. 368 pages."}, {"userName": "AJ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10709577-aj", "userReview": "I love books that make me forget I'm a writer. Tales so expertly woven, I forget things like 3-act structure and black moments. Stories that consume me so completely, I also forget things like dinner and bedtime. To-date, every single Jody Hedlund novel has lured me into such blissful amnesia, and \"A Noble Groom\" is no exception.I love fish-out-of-water stories, and Carl is one of the best--not least because he is entirely aware of how ill-suited he is to his new life, and isn't afraid to laugh at himself. And, subsequently, make me LOL right along with him (because every woman in the throes of childbirth surely craves pie). :-)My only complaint with Jody's books is that they end! I wish I could slow myself down while reading to make them last longer, but masterful stories such as hers just never let me. Not only a keeper, but a re-reader. I'll be revisiting Carl & Annalisa's story again and again.I received a courtesy copy of \"A Noble Groom\" from the publisher in return for my honest opinion, and I can honestly say that five stars is nowhere near a high-enough rating for this book."}, {"userName": "Jill Kemerer", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4645304-jill-kemerer", "userReview": "I know I'm going to love a book when I'm cheering out loud by page 14! I've read all of Ms. Hedlund's books, and this is her best yet, which is saying a lot since I devoured her first three! From page one the stakes are high, and they continue to rise until the powerful ending. Jody Hedlund is one of the rare authors who gives readers very different stories while staying in the historical genre. A Noble Groom takes place in mid-Michigan in the early 1880's. The heroine, a young mother, faces desperate circumstances due to her poor German roots, unpredictable Michigan weather, and having to rely on an unworthy husband. I won't give any spoilers, but the twists and turns in this story delighted me! With its fast pace, sympathetic characters, and excellent writing, I read this book in a day and didn't want it to end. In fact, I found myself wishing there would be another book giving the heroine's sister a happy ending too!I'm from mid-Michigan and have German roots, and I found myself nodding at many of the family attitudes and the plight of the farmer. A very authentic, finger-nail-biting, romantic book!"}, {"userName": "Kat", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6358333-kat", "userReview": "This author has a completely breathtaking way of portraying a love story with a star cast.

It held drama, suspense, romance, and some tough issues. The tale was incredibly sweet, yet at the same time, held some really bitter moments. But the ending was beautiful, :).

Characters were governed by their beliefs and sometimes prayed, which was appropriate for the time period & never got preachy. Not strictly a Christian romance. German immigrants held on to the ways of the Old Land and kept to their own people. Women had zero value, farmers wanted sons. Annalisa was always treated like she was worthless & her father and husband made all decisions. I never knew this about the German peasant class. I guess it makes sense that families fed and clothed the men, who were doing physically grueling labor, before women and children. It still makes me sad. There was a REALLY good kiss, gave me butterflies! Carl grew into a magnificent character. The writing was good. Will pick up a few more books by Jody Hedlund. 4 stars, recommended."}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7839064-nicole", "userReview": "Thoroughly enjoyed this read! I loved the story, the characters, and the tension. I loved the story-book romance, and the hero has to be one of my favorites of late. So witty and charming, and yet so...noble. Ha!This has been my favorite by Jody Hedlund so far. I think it's partially because the characters did not marry early on as in the others I've read, and so I felt like the author didn't take as many liberties with the couple. I liked how the author corrected the characters when they seemed to be losing track of truth. I'd be sitting there ranting \"What are you thinking?\" at the heroine, and then in the next paragraph she'd ask herself the same question.A lovely and satisfying read, and a wonderful reminder that God cares (and remembers) each and every one of His children!"}, {"userName": "Cara Putman", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/674427-cara-putman", "userReview": "Jody Hedlund is one of my favorite historical authors. I've learned I can trust her to write a novel filled with a hero and heroine I want to see win as well as a setting that is historically intersting. Noble Groom grabbed me as I longed for the heroine to discover what love could be like. And the hero was an absolute enigma. He intrigued me and left me wondering how on earth he would manage in the heroine's world. The German immigrant culture was richly drawn, and the author did a great job planting the story in the setting in such a way I can't imagine it taking place anywhere else. The hero's journey gave me thoughts of Joseph in places. And I think most of us can relate to the heroine's desire to be seen and loved for who she was.
