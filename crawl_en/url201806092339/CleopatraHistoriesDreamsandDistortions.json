She's the reason I have this book. Thank you Sisimka.Helen might have been the face that launched a thousand ships, but Cleopatra went further with a vulture beak on her face. Honestly, Cleopatra's nose was ugly. Yet, society credits Cleopatra with being a great beauty. A sexual adventuress, a femme fatale, a hot, murdering mama. But not really a mother, though she did have four children.Lucy Hughes-Hallett examines the myths and views of Cleopatra thoughout the ages. She spends the first section of the book going into detail about Ocatvain's story about Cleopatra versus what Cleopatra's story might have been. It is this first section of the book that provides biographically detail. Readers should be warned, however, that this book is not a biography of Cleopatra. Readers who want a straight forward biography should check out Michael Grant's work. The second half of the book deals with how artists and writers thoughout the ages have treated Cleopatra. The book was published in 199o so more recent treatments such as The Memoirs of Cleopatra are not mentioned.Hallett raises several interesting points. We are fasnicated by Cleopatra, but even today it is more in terms of her love affairs (and it seems she only had two) more than anything else. How many people reading this review, for instance, knew Cleopatra had four children? Having her as a mother limits the sexual beauty of Cleopatra that society has in its mind. The same is true of Helen, who was a mother when she abanonded husband and child to run off with Paris. Hallett focues on the idea of Cleopatra as other, as the Orient to the West and how each author uses Cleopatra to show how HE and his society sees women.What I found to be very interesting is the sheer number of paintings that show Cleopatra having the asp bite her breast when she commits suicide (Ouch!). There is proably some deep symbolism here, the inversion of life or something, and I wish Hallett had gone into that aspect of it a bit more.Hallett's conclusions still ring true today. Even in a pro-Cleopatra novel like The Memoirs of Cleopatrathe plot focuces on the love affairs. Cleopatra comes across as a saint and the men are not good enough for her. Then there is the other extreme, Cleopatra the queenly whore as in For Destiny or Desire. Cleopatra becomes what the writer wants her to be, sainted matyr or trashy romance heroine, not really who she was."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23948724-sara", "userReview": "Hughes-Hallett details Western characterisations of Cleopatra from Roman times to Elizabeth Taylor's portrayal of her in 1960s, alongside deconstructing every facet of the Cleopatra myth encountered over this long period.The book is separated into two parts. The first is broken down into the famous myth we\u2019re all accustomed to hearing and the historical sources from which these have been birthed from. Hughes-Hallett describes these sources and stories in three chapters: Fantasy and Fact, The Story according to Octavius and Cleopatra\u2019s Version. The second part then breaks down these popular images of Cleopatra, an outline of this in chapters includes: The Suicide, The Lover, The Woman, The Queen, The Foreigner, The Killer, The Child and Cleopatra Winks. Each section utilises a wide variety of literary works (from Virgil to George Bernard Shaw) and historical context which have both worked together & fed off each other to propel Cleopatra into immortality. Cleopatra will always be more a myth than historical fact, because her history has been written first by her victors and then by those who hold her in fascination, interpreted and reinterpreted differently to suit the person/time period who invokes her image for whatever purpose. Hughes-Hallett acknowledges that although in writing this book as objectively as possible, even she will subconsciously affix her own understanding of Cleopatra for the readers to digest. Such is life. Then again, it\u2019s because of this paradox I\u2019ll find more truth in this kind of book in than any prescriptive biography I\u2019ll read."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5084921-katie", "userReview": "This was a fantastic book. I wouldn't say it's a history per se but rather an analysis of Cleopatra's myth and how it has been changed depending on the time and the person writing it and how it changes in modern times. From opposing Roman and Egyptian propaganda in her own life time, to the blonde haired European, to the dark oriental foreigner Hughes-Hallet analyses it all. She's a mother, a killer, a childish bimbo, intelligent, stupid, a pacifist, a lover - one contraction after another. And that's why we love her."}, {"userName": "Robynt", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7755966-robynt", "userReview": "great"}, {"userName": "April Helms", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/706630-april-helms", "userReview": "This was a fascinating read. Hughes-Hallett doesn't write so much on the history of Cleopatra -- much of which is veiled partly by mystery and partly by propoganda -- but the various perceptions and interpretations of her character. Indeed, how we perceive Cleopatra probably is more of a reflection on society and the various authors rather than her. A lot of information about her has been through the filters of propaganda: the Egyptian queen's and the conquering Octavius'. There have been many movies dealing with Cleopatra, Julius Caesar and Marc Antony, ranging from drama to high camp. While there isn't much known historically about her, there were some tidbits mentioned I thought were interesting and surprising. One, while Cleopatra is often depicted as a femme fatale, she probably wasn't physically attractive (although she was almost certainly very charismatic). Also, the legend of her death by asps is probably not true (if it was snake bite, the author states, it was probably a cobra). There was one mistake and one thing that left me scratching my head. The mistake: when she's describing the famous movie starring Elizabeth Taylor, she describes the golden gown she wears as gold lame. From everything I've read and heard, the golden gown she wore was cloth of gold. There is a BIG difference between gold lame and cloth of gold. The thing that left me puzzled was the author also happened to mention another movie - Cat on a Hot Tin Roof - that Elizabeth Taylor also starred in. Hughes-Hallett compares Maggie (the main female character in \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\") to Cleopatra, and says that Maggie is a fast woman who tries to get another man's husband. Now a disclaimer: I've never seen the movie version of Tennassee Williams' work. But I've read the play and seen a staged version of it, and while it's possible the movie has deviated (a LOT) from the original play, from the movie descriptions I have read this characterization of Maggie seems a huge stretch, at best. Despite these setbacks this was still an informative and insightful read."}, {"userName": "Hailey Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4679123-hailey-johnson", "userReview": "A masterful account of an elusive subject-- the entire book was spellbinding, opening up many different channels of thought. The book is not a simple biography of an ancient queen, but a deconstruction of the myth that has surrounded Cleopartra is each successive generation since her famed lifetime. She examines the historical Cleopatra, as well as her symbols and different incarnations. Within the text he is the Killer Queen, the High Camp sex kitten, the sulking child, the frightening Other from the Orient, the Good Wife, the Harlot. Her examinations show that it is not the historical Cleopatra that is in question, but an understanding of gender roles throughout the ages. I cannot recommend this book enough!"}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2400010-beth", "userReview": "I am a big fan of Cleopatra. I am mostly fascinated by what society thinks of the woman and how that came to be. The Cleopatra most of today's world imagines is probably quite far removed from what she actually was. Her story is a classic case of revisionist history. This is a wonderfully researched book, very interesting. Highly recommended for anybody interested in history or even the general nature of \"spin\". If you like politics, this might also be a book you will like. The story of Cleopatra is all about spin, from her own spin when she was alive, to the spin of Octavian in the years after her death, to the spin of history."}, {"userName": "Tiffany", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1082709-tiffany", "userReview": "I've been obsessed with Cleopatra since I was a kid. I found this book stuffed behind some other old books in a thrift-type store. It had no price on it, so the person sold it to me for a dollar or something ridiculous.
