The professor was either brilliant or a total nut, I\u2019m still not sure, and one of the questions for our final exam was actually: Why? (Use diagrams to support your response).Ugh, ugh, ugh!!! I walked out of that class with a B and I kid you not, I have never worked so hard for a B in my life! I pity the one guy in my class who walked away with an A and don\u2019t even want to think about what his social life was like during that semester because I know mine was down the tubes.At one point, the kooky prof mentioned The Time Machine as some interesting (but not required) reading to pick up on the side. But since he already had us reading upwards of 1,000 pages a week and we were required to hand in a 7-10 page paper every Monday (just for the one class!!!!), I was like, \u201cscrew you! H.G. Wells can kiss my ass!\u201d And that\u2019s the funny thing about regret. Because now I\u2019m wishing I\u2019d have made time in my busy schedule to read it. Maybe I should have blown off another class for a couple hours so I could have read The Time Machine. And then I could have thought about it in a state of mind that was open and receptive to what was being said and layering it with some weird, academic extrapolations and connections (the kind professors slurp up) and it would become something ultra-meaningful and profound. Or something. But no, I read it now. At age 29. Because I was dragging my feet and didn\u2019t feel like finishing the book I\u2019m supposed to be reading about Al Qaeda. And so the entire time I was reading it, I was like, \u201chm, interesting. If I was a younger person and still remembered the specific details about theories I studied in my past life as a student, the ideas in this book would have given me a nerd brain orgasm. And hot diggity damn! This book would have made a fantastic paper for my Soc. Theory class! By referencing several schools of sociological thought and combining those with discussions of evolution, social deconstruction and combining all that with the social norms of Victorian peoples\u2014that would have knocked that prof\u2019s socks off!\"So anyway. I liked this book okay. I\u2019m really not a huge science fiction fan and that aspect probably kept me from getting into it as much as I could have given its potential for creating nerd brain o\u2019s. Plus, it was only 90 pages long. It\u2019s hard to really get into something that\u2019s that short. Parts of the story felt like they weren\u2019t fleshed out enough and Wells seemed to have skimmed over several scenes that shouldn\u2019t have been skimped on. But then I found out that his original intent for this story was to turn it into a full-fledged novel but that just never happened due to some financial burdens and it sort of made sense.The basic plot revolves around a Victorian gentleman and his theories about time travel. To prove them, he builds a machine and travels 800,000 years into the future where he befriends a group of people, the Eloi, who are descended from modern human beings. They are much shorter, childlike people who only eat fruit and spend most of their day playing games. They have no concept of work, they have no critical thinking skills and are incapable of logical reaction to problems. They are also terrified of the dark. After spending a few days with them, the Time Traveler discovers another distinct species, also descended from modern man but of a much more sinister nature. This second group lives underground, only comes out at night, is a bit more cunning than the gentle people who live aboveground and this group is also extremely predatory in that they cannibalize the Eloi. These are the Morlocks. The Time Traveler has several adventures during his time spent amongst the Eloi and the Morlocks and towards the end of the story, Wells makes some fairly blatant comparisons between the Eloi and the ultra-rich of our own society. If they spend their entire days being attended to by others, they will lose the ability to care for themselves and if they\u2019re not careful, over the course of time and evolution of the species, they could turn into the Eloi, a group of wimpy wimpsters upon whom a life of privilege has backfired."}, {"userName": "Bill  Kerwin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83582-bill-kerwin", "userReview": "Returning to a novel you liked years ago is often a risky business, particularly so when the genre of that novel is science fiction. Nothing can age so rapidly as the past\u2019s conception of the future, and what once seemed cutting edge may, after fifty years or more, appear simply ludicrous.Because of this, I was delighted to fine H.G. Wells at least as charming and exciting as I remembered it, the Time Traveler\u2019s scientific lecture still intriguing, the journey he describes still convincing, and the sociological history he reveals to us\u2014of the evolution of the two races, the Eloi and the Morlocks, still as persuasive as it it was in 1895. (Okay, I admit, not quite as persuasive as evolutionary biology, but\u2014given the rising gap between the rich and the poor\u2014still as compelling as a parable and cautionary tale.)Although I remembered vividly both the origin and appearance of the Eloi and the Morlochs, I had forgotten much of the rest, and what I forgot made the book even better: 1) the delightful clarity of the Time Travelers exposition to his audience about the nature of time as a dimension and the possibility of traveling through it, 2) the vivid description of the time-trip itself, a flickering cinematic-style vision, 3) the brutal destruction of the future of the English countryside, brought about by the Traveler\u2019s reintroduction of fire, and 4) his journey\u2019s end in a dying world of the far future, the almost religious tone of his musings.What was most clear to me, however, is how artfully H.G. Wells here combines scientific speculation, sociological parable, compelling adventure, and philosophical meditation. He both informs and delights, while never wearying his reader, in this book that is less than half the length of most of the first volumes of our current speculative fiction trilogies.Still a classic, and one that our contemporary writers would do well to emulate."}, {"userName": "Ahmad  Ebaid", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16783645-ahmad-ebaid",

his theories about time traveling.

I really admired the writing though it may be dry or dense for some, I think I've been reading long enough that it wasn't too much of an effort to read through this one. The premise was interesting and I was anxious for the Time Traveler when he was recounting his journey to get back to the present so the story did draw me in. Some of the social commentary felt quite questionable and pessimistic though. I enjoyed reading it though, it's not very long and it was interesting. Towards the end of the Time Traveler's journey I got a little bored but the ending was really good, I appreciate an open ended ending that lets you keep imagining what happened."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1720620-anne", "userReview": "An EXCELLENT adventure!Ok, so I'm sort of ashamed of myself because I thought this was a graphic novel of The Time Machine, and I was planning on using it to cut corners.

The nameless time traveler whips up a time machine and travels through time. What could be simpler?The Traveler goes to the year 802,000 and encounters the descendants of man, the Eloi and the Morlocks. Wells uses the Eloi and the Morlocks to illustrate the class differences in his own time but the Traveler's speculation on the haves and have-nots sounded very familiar, a nice bit of timeless social satire. After some misadventures, he returns home and no one believes him. To show those assholes, he goes on another jaunt and was never head from again. At least at the time of the Time Machine's publication.The Time Machine broke a lot of new ground. It was probably the first time travel story and it could be argued that it was both the first dystopian sf story and the first Dying Earth tale. It's also not much of a stretch to call it an ancestor of the planetary romance genre as well. There's not a lot separating The Traveler from John Carter of Mars, if you think about it.While there's a lot of fun timey-wimey stuff going on, Wells' prose isn't easy to digest. Part of it is the writing style of the time and another part is that science fiction was still in diapers at the time this was written. Wells' depiction of future Earth was a very memorable one, one that influenced countless authors that came after. Adjusting for the time period, The Time Machine is a fun yet somewhat difficult read.

Ray Bradbury\u2019s writing is a fantastic example. His fiction is imaginative; yet, it remains speculative. Nothing feels forced or impossible. The Time Machine, on the other hand, feels synthetic and false. I just could not buy into the story here. It is so very underwhelming. It\u2019s one of those pieces of writing in which the idea behind it causes the work to be celebrated but the actual thing itself, the language, the plot and the characters, are as dull as dishwater. It is mechanical, clunky and overly descriptive. There are long drawn out sections on scientific theory and mathematical formula. All in all, it\u2019s just not very engaging. As such I found it near impossible to invest in the story. I did not care about the characters and, for me, this is one of the most important things I look for in fiction. I need to be able to sympathise and relate to what the characters are going through otherwise the work feels cold and passionless. I may as well read a plot summary in such cases because the work creates nothing for me: it feels cold. In the case of the The Time Machine I simply did not care how it ended or even how it began: I just wanted it to be finished.

Wells' The Time Machine before now. By all accounts, this is the original time travel story. Still, social class and how technical innovations change humanity are more central to the story than whether the narrator was actually able to travel to 802,701 AD. Ever since, time travel stories have been about exploring the possibilities of the present rather than some far-flung future (or past). This novella was sometimes clunky (but it was written in 1895), but I found it a quick and fun read which continues to be thought provoking. And it has a solid ending!"}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7365405-james", "userReview": "H.G. Wells's The Time Machine was required reading in high school for most when I was in 9th grade (about 25 years ago), and one of my teachers chose this book as 1 of 10 books we read that year in an English literature comparative analysis course. Each month, we'd read a book and watch two film adaptations, then have discussions and write a paper. At the time, I thought, this book is a little cheesy... I mean, not that I was a huge Star Trek fan (although I did love me some Voyager), but even I know time machines were a lot cooler than what I saw in the movie and read about in the book. THEN, I realized HG Wells published this book in 1895... an entire century before I started watching TV shows about time travel. And that's when you realize what a priceless book this was. It was the advent of a new genre's blossoming into fandom. And I became fascinated with these types of stories. But there was so much more to it than time travel.It's a commentary on society and values. Are you ostracized when you think differently? What if you look different... like as in your skin looks blue. Do you know what a Morlock is? Check it out (thanks the original GIF source in link!)What I loved about this story was the thoughts and ideas of an 1890s man writing about the potential for traveling to the past and the future, suggesting what happens to humankind over time. In the era of Charles Darwin and the Origin of Species, or perhaps a few decades later, this book covers those ideas and helps activate a reader's imagination outside their own limited world. It was the 1890s... no TV, no phones, car engines being built for the first time, indoor plumbing had just become common in regular homes... life was every different.That said, it's the words and imagery that catch you in this book. You have to forego current life and pretend you were still back in time."}, {"userName": "Evgeny", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9340136-evgeny", "userReview": "A group read with a bunch of Pantaloonless Buddies.I have yet to see any decent movie adaptation of this science fiction classic, let alone a good one. The only reason I give a plot synopsis of this otherwise well-known story is that I am afraid some people would judge it by a (very lame) movie. This is the granddaddy of practically all time-travelling stories, including very new and popular sub-genre: time-travelling romance. An inventor built a time machine. He used it to travel to a distant future: 800,000 years to be exact - yes, he was way more ambitious than other iconic time travelers.You would not think I am able to write a review for this book without at least giving a nod to Back to the Future, would you? What he found in the future can be only described as one of the first dystopia in literature. It did not look like one at the first glance, so the main hero had to survive some dangerous situations to finally get the whole picture (it was not pretty). I am also not going to bet it would not come to be in real life. When I first read a book in my early teens I thought the theoretical explanation of time travelling in the beginning was boring. This time I really liked it as it did have some solid math background underneath its simplistic facade. The adventure part was still as exciting as during my first read. I also found the descriptions of dying Earth under dying Sun excellent, fascinating, and depressing in sense that they do mess up with you mind. Somehow I managed to miss very profound last sentence of the story during my first read. The only reason I did not give 5 stars to this book was somewhat heavy writing style at times which speaking honestly have not lowered my enjoyment by much."}, {"userName": "Justin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2795921-justin", "userReview": "The Time Machine is like going to Jimmy John's to get a sandwich because the bread is just amazing. It's so much better than any other sandwich chain out there, and I'm convinced they are using some form of illegal addictive substance in the baking process that keeps me coming back for more. The Time Machine is like that, but you only get turkey on your sandwich. No cheese or mayo or lettuce or tomato. Just turkey. The bread is still amazing though. Just like the beginning and the ending of The Time Machine. I loved how the books starts with the time traveler guy just hanging out with a bunch of dudes smoking away on cigars and drinking brandy. No one has a real name. They're just all hanging out, and the guy is telling them this crazy story about how he travelled in this machine way out into the future. It all seems so ridiculous and everyone is all skeptical. But the guy keeps going. And his story isn't really all that exciting after all. It's like that one friend you have that tells you a story they think is the best story in the history of stories, and they give you every little detail of the story so you're all bored to death listening to this stupid thing until your friend finally gets to the end of the story which is actually really good, but, hot diggity, you didn't need to hear every mundane detail leading up to the good stuff. That's how this book was for me which was kind of a bummer because it was about time travel. It started and ended strong, but I just felt kinda bored in the middle when the guy is just wandering around with the future creature things. I can appreciate all this did for the science fiction genre and time travel and whatnot, but I was a little underwhelmed. Three stars for the delicious bread, but I needed more condiments on my sandwich to give it a little more flavor. Jimmy John's FTW. I'm now gonna time travel into the future by sleeping.

As I have indeed traveled to 802,701AD and meet the lovely Weena a female Eloi and the dreadful Morlocks. The Time Machine he speaks of was made in the year 2222 but something even greater is in my possession much smaller and highly efficient the 'iFuture' watch is now the tool of Time travel it will revolutionize the whole time travel experience I have just finished the prototype and tested it. Infact I only wish Wells could tell of the year of 2666 the year of the undead, Zombies tread upon the earth society in mayhem and only few survivors to walk upon the land. I had indeed a purpose there and brought in time with me the virus to end the undead pandemic. Time Travel is indeed mans greatest invention and in the wrong hands mans worst nightmare and in the right hands a shining light of glory from darkness.This story is a grand work written in wonderful prose that has a deep thought provoking effectiveness on the reader. The vision of the future is indeed frightening especially his account of the end of life on earth. H G Wells is a writer of high intelligence, a grand thinker.Time Travel is an entertaining genre to write about, the success of the 11.22.63 by Stephen King and movies like Back to the Future, The Time Machine and Planet of The Apes prove that.\n\n\n \nReview also here and Movie adaptation trailer"}, {"userName": "Councillor", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40792319-councillor", "userReview": "How will the Earth look like 800,000 years in the future?

Wells was one of the first writers who tackled the topic of time-travelling and painted a rather convincing picture of the future.Published in 1895, the book introduces a scientist who uses a Time Machine to be transferred into the age of a slowly dying earth. Humans have been separated by time, genetics, wars and change of their habitats into two different races, the Eloi and the subterranean Morlocks. At only about 100 pages, Wells manages to delve into a lot of different topics, among which can be found the ambiguity of human natures, the mutual effects of humans on our planet and our planet on humans, as well as a profound look into what defines humanity itself.As a dystopian story, this tale has probably been rather ground-breaking back when it was published, and some might even consider it to be the father of all time-travel romance stories. Unlike more recent publications, however, Wells doesn't lose the point of his story in describing romantic affairs and dramatic love stories, but rather delivers a fast-paced narration coated with a prose not unlike most other writing styles from the Victorian era. Since the author builds up his story from some scientific background (the inclusion of which I highly appreciated because Wells didn't leave things unexplained), it is not easy to get into it, but once the narrative gains speed, you will digest this book in the course of a few hours.For me, the engaging writing and the adventurous atmosphere contributed a huge part to my enjoyment of the novella. His descriptions of the dying earth were fascinating and very memorable, as was the ending which surprised and depressed me simultaneously. Much has already been said about Wells' book and its contents, so I will conclude my review by saying that readers who are not afraid to read important dystopian classics should give this one a try."}, {"userName": "Jeff ", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12618229-jeff", "userReview": "What\u2019s in store for the future?Well, maybe some spoilerish content if you haven\u2019t read this book yet.If you go by H. G. Wells novella, society (at least in merry future England circa 802,000 AD) will have been split between the Eloi and Morlocks in a bizarre twist on the haves and have nots.What we predict for the distant future is predicated on what\u2019s happening in the present. Wells future is filtered from the political science theories of his day. Capitalism-Communism, Workers-Idle rich, Industrial Age Woohah, but when it boils down to the story itself, Wells presents a fairly compelling glimpse for what\u2019s down the road in a gazillion years or so.What gave me goosebumps was when the Time Traveler left Morlockville and ended up in the waning days of Earth, as the planet hurtled into the abyss. I can\u2019t imagine sitting there and getting a glimpse as everything comes to an end. It would be mind-blowing. This is far scarier than ducking a bunch of cannibalistic white monkeys. Just laser-tag those Magoo bitches.Unless I was a gambling man, my choice, because I\u2019ve always been a history buff, would be to hop on the souped-up time machine/lawn mower and journey into the past and wreak havoc there.This is the second buddy read of a Wells classic by the Goodreads Legion of Non-Crunchy Pantsless Classics Readers Guild, the first being The Invisible Man awhile ago. It\u2019s easy to see how Wells has had a profound influence on popular culture; his concepts are still being harvested and expanded on to this day \u2013 he\u2019s the Stan Lee of the turn of the century minus the self-promotion and \u201cfoggy\u201d memory of course.In the future, they\u2019ll build Meth labs on the Moon."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7668522-carol", "userReview": "THE TIME MACHINE begins with the time traveller requesting absolute silence and no interruptions while telling the story of his astonishing journey into a strange and dangerous futuristic world of unfamiliar creatures.And When he had concluded his tale of the little people, his fear of the underground and the dark nights, he was greatly disappointed of his inability to convince his esteemed colleagues of its validity.And Then......the ending......uh oh......not what I was expecting.Published in 1895 H.

Wells had quite the imagination for the bizarre as evidenced in this timeless sci-fi classic."}, {"userName": "Carmen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen", "userReview": "\"In a moment I knew what had happened. I had slept and the bitterness of death came over my soul.\"H.G. Wells is such a good writer. Not only does he have an amazing imagination that carries him to impossible places, but he is very skilled at writing. The descriptions in this book are absolutely stunning.The book deals with a British, upper-class white man who has invented a time machine telling all his cronies about it in the smoking-room. He has traveled to the year 802701, and you have to admire Wells for not making the classic mistake of setting the future too close to the present. I'm certain this story will have impact for millenia to come due to his far-reaching decision.In the year 802701, there are the kind, playful, gentle child-like people who live on the surface of the planet: the Eloi. The Time Traveller goes on and on and on about how humanity is going to kill itself by becoming \"too safe\" and \"too peaceful\"... something I am rather doubtful about happening, BUT ANYWAY, there's also a dark secret lurking in the year 802701, and the Time Traveller gets his first glimpse of it when his Time Machine mysteriously vanishes. Who has taken it and why? Can he ever get it back?\"At once, like a lash across the face, came the possibility of losing my own age, of being left helpless in this strange new world. The bare thought of it was an actual physical sensation. I could feel it grip me at the throat and stop my breathing.\"Of course there are missteps in here, things that will have you shaking your head like comparing \"savages\" to animals, and the threat of COMMUNISM(!) that actually had me laughing out loud.\"Looking round, with a sudden thought, from a terrace on which I rested for a while, I realised that there were no small houses to be seen. Apparently, the single house, and possibly event the household, had vanished. Here and there among the greenery were palace-like buildings, but the house and the cottage, which form such characteristic features of our own English landscape, had disappeared.'Communism,' said I to myself.\"LOL LOL LOL He thinks the weak, gentle, friendly people of the upper earth are indolent. \"They spent all of their time in playing gently, in bathing in the river, in making love in a half-playful fashion, in eating fruit and sleeping. I could not see how things were kept going.\"And he's like, \"Those fucking communists!\" LOL LOL LOL I couldn't stop laughing. *wipes eyes*Okay. ANYWAY, the book is good. Short, gripping, with suspense and excitement - paired with Wells exquisite writing.Here's him describing what travelling through time feels like:\"I am afraid I cannot convey the peculiar sensations of time travelling. They are excessively unpleasant. There is a feeling exactly like that one has upon a switchback - of a helpless headlong motion! I felt the same horrible anticipation, too, of an imminent smash. As I put on pace, night followed day like the flapping of a black wing. The dim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to fall away from me, and I saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky, leaping it every minute, and every minute marking a day. I supposed the laboratory had been destroyed, and I had come into the open air. I had a dim impression of scaffolding, but I was already going too fast to be conscious of any moving things. The slowest snail that ever crawled dashed by too fast for me. The twinkling succession of darkness and light was excessively painful to the eye. Then, in the intermittent darknesses, I saw the moon spinning swiftly through her quarters from new to full, and had a faint glimpse of the circling stars. Presently, as I went on, still gaining velocity, the palpitation of night and day merged into one continuous greyness: the sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue, a splendid luminous colour like that of early twilight; the jerking sun became a streak of fire, a brilliant arch, in space, the moon a fainter fluctuating band; and I could see nothing of the stars, save now and then a brighter circle flickering in the blue.\"I don't know about you, but I could read Wells all day. It's so pretty. My 1978 copy of this book was literally falling apart in my hands as I was reading this. Oh, well, I'm sure it's free on Kindle.Tl;dr - Not too long, full of amazing writing, this book is truly transporting. Wells is good at building suspense and creeping you out. He also delivers on some excellent descriptive passages. If he is a little misguided on his ideas about the future, that can be forgiven. It sure is entertaining reading, and understandable why this has been a classic.\"I suppose a suicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels much the same wonder at what will come next as I felt then.\"BOOKS THIS REMINDED ME OF:Gulliver's TravelsThe SparrowGroup-Read with my Pantsless Friends. :)"}, {"userName": "Leonard Gaya", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27098959-leonard-gaya", "userReview": "Reading this book has been an eye-opener and is far from what I expected or had in mind. \"The Time Machine\" is not primarily a novel about time travel, time travel paradoxes and so forth. It is chiefly a speculation on the far future of humanity and the evolution of the industrial civilization.It starts as an almost casual chat by the fireside about the possibility of traveling through the fourth dimension and the invention of a machine, oddly described much like a common bicycle, that can travel through time. The \"Time Traveller\" (he is never named) then pays a visit to the human race of the year 802,701 and discovers what, at first, looks like a utopia: the descendants of the human race seem to live, in perfect harmony, a leisurely existence in a garden full of flowers. But as the night comes, a frightful reality soon replaces this vision... As in some other novels Wells has left us (The War of the Worlds), the Under World soon threatens the apparent peace of the Upper World. The end of the story is an unsettling flight to the most remote and crepuscular future of the Earth. Finally, the Time Traveller disappears leaving but a few flowers on his desk.This novella (some 60 pages) is a seminal work of the science-fiction genre. It remains to this day a landmark that has influenced almost all the utopian or dystopian writers, from Olaf Stapledon's Last and First Men to Michel Faber's Under the Skin.For the record: I have been persuaded to go back to \"The Time Machine\" by several references that Thomas Pynchon makes to H.G. Wells in Against the Day, which I am reading in parallel. I am using the H.G. Wells collection and the next stop is: The Island of Dr. Moreau."}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani", "userReview": "797.\tThe Time Machine, H.G. WellsThe Time Machine is a science fiction novella by H. G. Wells, published in 1895 and written as a frame narrative.

little about it before going into it aside from the eponymous time machine. But I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by it. Recognizing that it ultimately focuses very little on the machine itself and much more on the time traveler's adventure into the future & the cautionary tale that unfolds due to his findings makes this book a more enjoyable experience. It follows that classic 'unnamed narrator recounting story of other unnamed character' structure, even with a bit of story within a story (a la Frankenstein). Clearly H.G. Wells had an agenda behind this book, as it seems to be a response to Britain's cultural and economic situation in the late 19th century. Nevertheless, it was a fun and entertaining read, and the audiobook--narrated by Sir Derek Jacobi--was excellent."}, {"userName": "Jason Koivu", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1742824-jason-koivu", "userReview": "Still thrills to this day! Yes, it's dated and compared to other sci-fi it will look like child's play, but there's a genuinely creepy moment or two within The Time Machine. And by now, reading this is sort of like reading a sci-fi history book!A Victorian-era scientist reveals that he has created a time machine and goes on to relate his harrowing adventures into the future, where he meets a race apparently so advanced they've stop doing anything, as well as a monster race of subterranean dwellers with a peculiar connection to the others.Eloi and Morlock, together imperfect harmony...Wells created a cautionary tale for an ever-evolving scientific world. Yes, even in the Victorian area it was apparent which way the human race was headed. It's that easy living life-style that we've strived for since the earliest invention. It can be taken too far, says Wells.

I don't think there's any disputing that H.G. Wells was a genius and that his work was brilliant back in the day. But I just don't think that it ages all that well. Or maybe society has begun its long and inevitable evolution into the indolent beings Wells' time traveler claims that we become in roughly 800,000 years, and we don't want to think too hard about a narrative that takes some time to get to the point. Probably at some point between the Victorian era when this was written and the year eight hundred thousand whatever, we will have started beaming storypictures directly into our brains and thus have no need for narrative any longer. They say that a picture is worth a thousand words, and Wells was determined to use as many of them as possible. And so it is with maybe a tiny twinge of regret that I have to give this only 2 stars, because the narrative is where this book lost me. It was sooooooooooooooooo long and drawn out, with so many descriptions and so many needless details that my advanced future brain just wandered off in search of shiny things. I think the premise here is pretty cool, but the actual story didn't do much for me... Usually, at least in my experience, time travelers usually go BACK in time. Either to change something, or learn something, or just accidentally. This one went forward in time. Why? Because he could, I guess. He wanted to see where humanity ends up? I don't know. So, we find that in the year eight hundred thousand whatever that humanity has evolved along two different lines. An upper class set of Eloi, who are so advanced that they... do nothing? And the Morlocks, who have moved underground and adapted to a mole-like lifestyle. Until they ran out of food, anyway. But, I have a coupla problems with this book. For one, I don't think that that kind of evolution would happen in less than a million years, considering how long it's taken for humans to develop from pre-human primates to where we are now. Second... The time machine only moved through time. It stayed in the exact place it started, geographically, until it was moved by someone else. But, Earth is moving through space. Our solar system is moving through space. Our galaxy is moving through space. Everything is moving through space. If you were to jump in the air and skip a minute of time, where you land will not be where you started. It might not be far off, because it's only a minute, but it will be off. And if you were to travel eight hundred thousand whatever years in the future, the earth is no longer going to be in the same location in space. So... you probably land in the vacuum of space and die. When Mr. Time Traveler came back, as he had to do to tell his tale, and his time machine was moved several feet or yards or whatever away, I thought to myself, \"OK so we're ignoring the moving through space thing... but how lucky for him that his machine was still located within the confines of his lab. What a shame it would have been to arrive back home and end up trapped in the wall because the machine was moved one foot too far to the left. Oopsie!\"It must be a big lab. Third, I just don't see the Morlocks as scary or disgusting or, well, anything but pitiable. They evolved along a different line, or so Mr. Time Traveler theorizes, and that made them less pretty, and thus lower class citizens relegated to the sewers and given the upper class's scraps - which only further helped along their evolutionary distancing, if we go along with dude's theory. They become less human, and more primitive, and do what they need to do to survive, as ALL life does. But with attitudes like Mr. Time Traveler's, is it any wonder they became what they did? It's like Frankenstein's monster all over again. We create things we don't understand and then throw them away when they aren't pleasant. I bet this was scary shit when it was written, but now? I just feel sorry for the Morlocks and think that the Eloi and Mr. Time Traveler are a bunch of dicks.

But through a natural infirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you in a moment, we incline to overlook this fact. There are really four dimensions, three which we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time. There is, however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the former three dimensions and the latter, because it happens that our consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latter from the beginning to the end of our lives.\u201d\n Ah! The original wibbly wobbly timey wimey novel (well, Mark Twain\u2019s A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court predates The Time Machine, and perhaps some other books as well, but never mind, you can put me right in the comments section if you want). Certainly it is the first one that I ever read as a wee lad. Last week I was looking for a short free audiobook for a bus journey and for some read on I thought of H.G. Wells and picked The Time Machine as it is my favorite.The only problem I have with reading this book is that it is already \u201cspoiled\u201d long before I read the first paragraph. I remember all the major plot points very well, and what sci-fi fans have never heard of Elois and Morlocks? What I have no memory of is Wells\u2019 prose style and his narrative talents. As the above quoted passage shows he was an eloquent writer with a rare ability to make scientific expositions sound elegant.Wells was also an amazing story teller, the story may seem like old hat now but if you imagine that you have never heard of this story and never read anything like it before it is quite an astounding and riveting story. Consider the world building of his Dystopian far future with the two sub species of the human race. It is a beautiful piece of social satire and a thought provoking metaphor for social classes which are still prevalent today hundreds of years after the publication of this novel. There is not much in the way of characterization but that is perfectly fine for a book this short, besides the Elois are all hippy-ish airheads and the Morlocks are not interested in conversations. The protagonist does not even have a name.The last couple of chapters may well be the most atmospheric. Wells\u2019 depiction of an even further future beyond the Elois and Morlocks era is a little surreal and quite eerie. Those crab things seem like something out of H.P. Lovecraft. The conclusion of the novel is also nice and mysterious, mystical even. If you think H.G. Wells is old hat but never actually read any of his books I urge you to give him a try. Certainly I intend to reread The War of the Worlds, The Invisible Man etc. before too long. Yes, they are all old hats but they are great hats! Classic headwears never go out of fashion.Finally I would like to bookend this review with another favorite passage:\n\u201cYou know of course that a mathematical line, a line of thickness nil, has no real existence. Neither has a mathematical plane. These things are mere abstractions. Nor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have a real existence. So most people think. But wait a moment. Can an instantaneous cube exist?Can a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a real existence?\nI have no idea but it sounds great!Note: I read the free Librivox audiobook version, read by Mark Nelson, the reading is excellent."}, {"userName": "\u00c7a\u011fda\u015f T", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23597312-a-da-t", "userReview": "J.

Go on.\"*speaker steps up to podium to speak*Greetings Pantsless lads and ladies,This month's non-crunchy classic, The Time Machine by H.G. Wells, is about a tourist. That tourist. You know the one. The one no one not on the tourist board wants in their country. The one who, after spending a few scant days in a new place, thinks himself an expert on everything there is to know about that country. He knows their ills and their woes. Their joys and their struggles. He has completely absorbed all the decades of nuance contained within their social and economic structure. And of course, he is happy to tell you all about it. Our time traveler is such a tourist. That his travels are to the future changes little.\"Let me tell you about your history of oppression of the labour class,\" he says. \"Let me tell you about the vast underground network of structures that exist in your country. I know because I saw some empty wells and a couple of towers in the distance.\" \"Let me tell you why you turned to cannibalism. Oh, I can tell because I saw some meat on a table, so it must be human flesh.\" \"Let me disrupt your sleep by storming through your sleeping area at night because what I need is more important than your rest.\" Ok, he didn't say that last one. His actions did though.\nFor I am naturally inventive, as you know.\nHis actions. Oh, his actions. The tourist badgers people constantly, getting frustrated when the native peoples do not allow him to always be the center of attention. He claims some great conspiracy when his vehicle gets towed after he just parks it in the middle of the yard. He invades people's workplaces and homes uninvited. He burns down the sacred forest. And then... to top it all off, he assaults the native citizens. Those poor, legally blind Morlocks who get by mostly on touch. He just beats them. He invades their homes, and when they try to figure out who he is (by touch, because they can't see well), he kicks and punches them. Then when they are fleeing for their lives from the fire he started, he kills them. This tourist spends a few days in a new country and decides it is ok to murder the native people! It's sickening, really.\nWeena I had resolved to bring with me to our own time.\nIf all of that wasn't bad enough, he even had plans to lure one of the local woman back home with him. Despicable. This tourist is too dumb to bring a camera on a trip to a new land. Too dumb to bring a pencil and paper even though he calls himself a scientist. But he thinks one of the native citizens would be better off with him. And of course, through it all, he claims his own virtue. \nI was almost moved to begin a massacre of the helpless abominations about me, but I contained myself. \nAs if not being a mass-murderer is somehow a virtue. Perhaps to this worst of all tourists, it is. But for the rest of us, not assaulting strangers is a given. And so we must prevent such tourists from coming to our country! We must protect our forests! We must protect our defenseless! We must build a wall. A wall in time! A time wall!

It particularly had a hand in urging me toward Jekyll & Hyde for our October read (and I'll likely read it either way come Halloween time) thanks to the way the story, or at least part of it, is told by a character who is seeing things from outside the main character's point of view. That is, our narrator is retelling the story to the reader as it is being told to him by the time-traveler. John Utterson does this in a similar fashion in the Jekyll & Hyde story, if memory serves me.Anyway, the story itself was beautifully told and very suspenseful. Scott Brick did an excellent job narrating, as always, and I'm looking forward to stumbling across Wells again in the future."}, {"userName": "Ghofran ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2017", "userURL":
