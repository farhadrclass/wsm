Through no fault of his own, Malcolm is put into a mental institution where he spends his most formative years \u2013 from small child to middle-age. The reader can not remain unmoved by his situation, yet the skill of the Author means one isn\u2019t overcome by thoughts of blame and recrimination \u2013 rather, the story that is revealed is one of humanity throughout.

Swisher Jr.At one time I worked on a rural farm in Iowa. Next to the farm was an abandoned two story building that had heavy wire over the windows. When I inquired about the building I was told that years earlier the state kept crazy people and \"crips\" there. I went through the building one day, saw the old locks, the single beds, the small 10' by 10' rooms and wondered what anguish, loneliness, and alienation these people thought as their lives drifted by. The walls echoed the cruelty of it all. At the time they called it, \"GOD's WILL\" Susan Tarr's novel is the story of these mental people and these \"crips\" in a different time and a different country. It is sad but also uplifting. Is there really a fringe to normal or are we all on the fringe, living within the absurdity of life because we can understand what society calls normal? Is the ability to walk and see the hallmark of our lives? It's a great book - even has a few smiles.

Though this enthralling account of Malcom has essentially been fictionalised, it draws from very true facts and situations, and essentially it isn\u2019t merely highlighting the intriguing, but often gloomy existence of our central figure, but also the whole environment he lives in and how institutions of this sort have altered over the years.The writing is crisp and concise, and woven together with adept skill, the characters wonderfully realised and portrayed, and they will elicit a wide array of responses from the reader, ranging from the thrilled to the grief-stricken, and in some instances you may be truly disgusted by some of the actions, but unable to stop yourself from laughing. There is such a classic moment relayed in here which fits this category well, but I certainly won\u2019t reveal it, you will know what I speak of when you read it.As a general rule this type of book would not be in my usual span of genres, but I can say without hesitation that I\u2019m supremely glad I read it and better for the experience.This is touching, it is uplifting, emotive and of course, also incredibly melancholy in places too, as one can well imagine how primitive methods of treating and dealing with institutionalised souls were back in the early days of the twentieth century. If not for the adroit skills of the author at being able to temper the mood where required, with sufficient splashes of humourous narrative, this could have become an extremely austere and depressing tome, but instead, it becomes a wonderful achievement that allows Malcolm to become a hero in his own right.\u2018Phenomena: The Lost and Forgotten Children\u2019 is a triumph. Read it, no matter what your ordinary choice of reading material is. You will be enriched by it."}, {"userName": "C.N.", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3030519-c-n", "userReview": "It is easy to forget the unpleasant history of how we, as a race, tended to sideline those who were 'inconvenient' in some way or another. The forgotten people needed a champion and now they have one with this book. Why people became 'inconvenient' is in every respects just as horrific as what happened to them afterwards. Saddest of all are the unwanted children. Those who were less than perfect and therefore didn't quite fit in. Malcom, the main character, has a weak eye, weak arm and a foot needing a special shoe. He is not the sort of son his father wants after his mother dies and the father finds a new woman. This is how a child with normal intelligence ends up in a mental hospital. Of course he is not going to maintain a normal stream education as he is trying to learn alongside those who really are severely handicapped, and even so, don't deserve to be in a mad house. His best friend, Jenny, is incarcerated because she is a blind orphan no one wants to raise. This is Malcom's story of how he lives with his allotted place in life. It is also a very accurate record of the sort of barbaric treatments and regimes handed out to the so-called lunatics. I had heard of lobotomy and how useless and destructive this was, however, I hadn't realized electric shock therapy was also so utterly cruel, or what it did to the unlucky victims. While I did know young girls were committed for becoming pregnant, I had no idea they were also subjected to de-sexing. All this is revealed through the gentle, compassionate and sometimes humorous point of view of Malcom. There is an enormous capacity for compassion inside him and so much so that a person wonders what he might have achieved if he had been allowed to grow up normally."}, {"userName": "C.L. L.

The inner workings of the mind have always been a passion of mine. This book has taken me down a story of an individual who lived through the horrific treatments of mental illness first hand. You will fall in love with Malcolm as his character comes alive from the paper, almost as if standing next to you telling you his story. The pain you feel for him when he loses his very best friend, to the fear of having to go through \u201cThe treatment\u201d, every step he takes is beautifully written in a way that defines his personality beautifully. Each scene is drawn out and painted in your mind, and every section of dialogue illuminates the character\u2019s tiny quirks and faults in a way that you learn to love and hate them at the same time. Upon finishing the book, you will walk away with a sense of pain in your heart for all those forgotten souls. These poor children and adults who are thrown away and kept locked up from society as if they are a batch of disease ridden meat. My heart aches for them, and the fact that this is drawn from facts makes it that much harder to swallow. I want to congratulate the author on the bravery it takes to tell a story like this. Thank you for being the voice for the people like Malcolm who, at times, aren\u2019t able to find their own voices.

It\u2019s not an average prototype of fiction, with its usual genres and formulas. It\u2019s the unique story \u2013 inspired by true people and facts \u2013 of a little boy\u2019s terrible experience of growing in a mental hospital. Unlike the other patients there, Malcom had never fit in and struggled to keep his normality in a heart and mind-wrenching environment. The story has a depth that could only come from life experience, from knowledge of the human psychology and behavior. Although the first part is sad and introduces shocking and depressing aspects of the treatments and life imposed to mental hospitals\u2019 patients , the author skillfully manages to sprinkle some humor in the darkest situations.

There is so much to this story that will haunt the reader as they understand Malcolm\u2019s struggle with life and in-patient treatment. I found it interesting how the author told the story from his point of view and brought us into his world, almost making the reader wonder if it was really happening, had really happened or was just fiction.

This is indeed a Phenomena that I have never heard of in the world before.  The \u201cin and out\u201d quality of Malcolm\u2019s stories reflects the type of treatment he received that would rob him of his memory. He worked and worked each time to reclaim his memories and recall the stories he heard, reconciling them to stories he heard as he grew older. The past and present intertwined to make a beautiful basket of memories. I\u2019d like to quote Malcolm at this point so that you can get a taste of Susan Tarr\u2019s beautiful writing: \u201cConfusion muddled his thoughts with roiling patterns. And the wild sea at the bottom of the cliffs had never looked so inviting. His mind turned to Julie who existed only in darkness. She told him her parents had disappeared while she was spending a day with her grandmother. Tea was eaten, it was night time, and still they never came for her. Her grandmother continued to care for her. It was years later when blind Julie was found by the neighbors, along with her dead grandmother. Malcolm knew what happened to people like Julie. They were deposited, confused and bewildered, into the care of the mental hospitals for the unloved and unlovable, the uneducated and the unwanted \u2013 soon forgotten, feeding the insatiable appetite of the institution, placating the guilt of the knowing masses. Deposited there to be described, measured, weighed and quantified, labelled, segregated and finally, cattle-ised \u2013 as had happened to him.\u201d This story is a string of stories about the people at the \u201chospital\u201d and surrounding buildings, some buildings like prisons for the more severe cases and some buildings were pleasant, half-way houses surrounded by gardens. These were reserved for those getting ready to transfer into a more normal life. The saddest story was how Malcolm came to be at Seacrest Mental Hospital in the first place. Wow. I know it happens but it\u2019s hard to believe a parent would do this. Despite his bitterly sad history, Malcolm became a kind-hearted, upbeat man with a hope-filled future as a \u201cregular\u201d person.Personal favorite.This book was given to me by the author in exchange for a fair and honest review."}, {"userName": "Arkgirl", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6482004-arkgirl", "userReview": "Based loosely on some real stories this is a book that is at times heartbreaking, sometimes challenging but also has moments of light relief and some chinks of humanity in amongst the tough life the main character, Malcolm, lives. Centred around a New Zealand mental hospital following the treatment and care of those who found themselves placed there, often because they have been abandoned rather because of any specific condition, it doesn't shy away from some really hard stories. The reality of their lives can at times be shocking and disturbing but it does feel incredibly honest.The book jumps about from 1954 back to the early 30's but our main focus is always on Malcolm, an endearing, gentle and sensitive soul that you soon discover has coped remarkably with much that life has thrown at him; he is gradually trying to pull together his memories so that his life can achieve some structure and stability. Seen through his eyes there is a real innocence as he explores his past and the abuse he has suffered but he manages to strive forward in a wonderfully positive way.The author is obviously writing with a wealth of knowledge and understanding but although it adds interest it doesn't distract from the heart of the story, Malcolm's story. It is a poignant and moving read, Malcolm as a character will stay with me for a long time.

The author has not only dived deep into the institution and its history, she has also dared an attempt to look into Malcolm's head and his perception of it. We live with him and hear him describe how life at the various episodes of his disease and its treatment was for him.Much of the world is seen from his perspective which makes the story all the more powerful, esp. knowing that much of this has happened for real.We all have seen a change of terminology, from lunatic asylum to mental health - and this is just the tip of the iceberg.

Her story, a mixture of fact and fiction is one that will linger with me for a long time to come. Cruelty and misunderstandings about social behaviour towards our fellow man are all depicted here in a tender way, yet I was saddened by just how low people can stoop when not wanting to take responsibility for others deemed, undesirable.Malcolm and his fellow \"inmates\" had strong stories to tell and the author's descriptive writing brought them to life immediately. This young boy who was so cruelly abandoned could have had a full and wonderful life but instead he is destroyed before he is even given a chance. This book holds a powerful message but I'm not going to go into the story, as I believe each reader will take something personal, and unique away with them.

One aunt for having a baby as an unmarried teenager and another for throwing bricks through the windows of her husband\u2019s mistress\u2019 house.It is hard to believe that the human race were so barbaric not that many years ago, in fact we still are in many respects. \u00a0When I was growing up in the 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s there were very few disabled people about. I can remember people having babies and been told the child has been sent away to be looked after because something was wrong with it. It was always miles away too. I lived in Yorkshire and the children were always sent down south. They were never visited. I believe that it was thought the couple would get over it quicker the further away the \u2018problem\u2019 was. I only ever knew one disabled child when I was growing up, he was much younger than me. A thalidomide baby and of course the ones that had polio so had a thin leg and caliper.Now for one child\u2019s journey. Meet Malcolm. Malcolm has to be one of the most courageous people you could ever want to meet and his story is just heartbreaking. This story is set in New Zealand where the author knew Malcolm when she was a child and he a young man. When Malcolm was abandoned at the railway station after his widowed father remarried, he was taken to Seacliff Mental Hospital. No one really wanted a child with disabilities and Malcolm came with three physical ones, but was as bright as a button. He wasn\u2019t the only child there. Here were the damaged ones that society wanted to forget about, the most vulnerable incorporated with not only adults that shouldn\u2019t be there either but more frighteningly the ones that did.It seems there was nothing there to protect them from the barbaric treatments and quite often unnecessary medication dealt out to sedate patients not make them well. The author captures \u00a0this era perfectly telling the story from the inside. There are some lighter moments as well as a particular quite strange and macabre story of dealing with an abundance of cats at the hospital.I was totally engrossed in this story which introduced me to this gentle man who still had the ability to show others compassion.

As trauma after trauma manifested in this young boy's life, his brain closed off the section when his memories became too much to handle. As a result he became more quiet and eventually stop speaking altogether. He had to endure terrible odds to survive, but had the presence of mind to know what was actually happening with- and around him. He was admitted to the Seacliff Asylum, which later would be named Seacliff Mental Hospital.

In spite of beautiful surroundings and well-meant but ignorant care, the history of Seacliff is grim and grey.Susan Tarr has told the story from Malcolm\u2019s perspective.This boy spent decades shut away, slowly melding into the dumb, confused existence, a rule of fear and obey enforced by shock treatments he didn\u2019t understand or deserve.Even so, he grew up big and strong, observant and gentle. He befriended everybody, patiently listening to their stories: stories of murder, suicide, poverty, abortions, and abandonment.In order that he might survive, he began to hide his pills inside the lining of his jacket. He learnt how to avoid the treatments, and so threads of his memory began to return. These he put together like a jigsaw puzzle, memorising facts, constantly adding to his knowledge in his quest to find the regular person inside him.This is an inspirational story, based on a real Malcolm.

I expected PHENOMENA to be depressing and sad, but I was so wrong. Sure this book is about a mental institute in the early part of the 20th century. But it focuses on triumph over inhumane odds. The characters are so real, and most are lovable, especially Malcolm, the young boy who lives in the The Building. It's his story told from his perspective. The author SusanTarr, even writes humor into this historic New Zealand work. And there\u2019s an extensive afterword on the history of SEACLIFF Mental Hospital, NZ. I received this book as a gift and the writing is beautiful and easy to read. I loved it!Highly recommended and 5 stars!"}, {"userName": "Anthony Hulse", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21750394-anthony-hulse", "userReview": "A SHAMEFUL STORY BEAUTIFULLY WRITTENA regular boy is abandoned into a mental asylum. In order that he might survive, he began to hide his pills in his jacket. He had to avoid the shock treatments so his fractured memory might return. Based on a real person this is also the history of the institution of New Zealand's Seacliff Mental Hospital and the way people viewed those who were hidden behind walls.

Even though it's not written in the first person, I found myself connecting with Malcolm and wishing that things could have gone differently for him. He was one of many that were sent to such facilities for no good reason and had to fend for themselves.The author has done a brilliant job with the book. It's a hard read in places, and yet there are some light hearted, even amusing parts to the story too. The other characters - both Malcolm's friends/housemates, and the nursing staff were also really well written.An emotive and absorbing read."}, {"userName": "Antony Millen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5889880-antony-millen", "userReview": "Phenomena: The Lost and Forgotten Children tells the true story of Malcolm, a patient at Seacliff Mental Hospital in the early-mid 20th century. It is an extraordinarily sad tale, though not without a hopeful ending, set on the rugged but beautiful South Island coast of New Zealand, just outside of Dunedin. Through Malcolm's journey, we meet a plethora of \"Cuckoo's Nest\" characters who impact Malcolm in his quest to determine his own level of sanity and either prepare him for a return to society outside the walls of Seacliff or convince him of his need to remain.In her Afterword for the book, Susan Tarr writes, \"I always thought the history about the inside of Seacliff Mental Hospital should not be lost, especially as so many from my own era who lived at Seacliff are now gone.\" This is a good place to start for any writer: to tell the stories of those who cannot tell their own.However, as interested as I was in reading this book, I was also wary of Tarr's intent. To tell these stories, why not produce an historical non-fiction, freely and clearly describing the background and context behind the lives of these figures? I was wary of an agenda which, when woven into a novel, could potentially detract from the all-important objectivity of the fictional narrative voice.I needn't have worried (or warried?). While there were times when I could detect Tarr's perspective over-riding Malcolm's, she maintains an objective narrative. Even better, her use of language is superb: lyrical and idiomatically New Zealand. Tarr's vocabulary, so specific for the region, the people and the unique setting, reads naturally, flowing from the experiences familiar to the author.It is evident that Tarr's intent was to tell many different stories of the people of Seacliff. This was admirably done via Malcolm whose interactions prompt the telling of these stories. Through the middle of the book, I did wonder where it was all going and not always in a good way as I found myself content to set the book aside for stretches of time rather than feeling compelled to find out what would happen next. Perhaps it was meant to feel this way - an attempt to help the reader experience the aimlessness of these characters as they languish in Seacliff. However, in an unusual structure, the pace of the book picks up in the second half as more details of Malcolm's background are revealed until, finally, two of my favourite themes are addressed: that of the institutionalised facing freedom (think \"Shawshank Redemption\") and that of the beleagured finding his voice - in this case, Malcolm with the assistance of Nurse West.Overall, Phenomena: The Lost and Forgotten Children accomplishes what it sets out to do: enlighten the reader to shameful treatment of the marginalised of the past and give voice to similar in the present. Better still, Tarr has done this in an imaginative, artistic and poetic manner - an impressive book that should be read by more New Zealanders.Antony Millen is a Canadian author living and writing in New Zealand.

The story is set in New Zealand at the Seacliff Mental Hospital near Dunedin, told through the eyes of Malcolm, a boy abandoned by his father at the age of seven at a railway station. In reading this book, one sees the heartbreak, the abuse that these poor people went through. Some locked away as they were an embarrassment or socially not accepted. Catherine who was forced to have an abortion and sterilisation by her parents and then locked away as she was seen as promiscuous. Her father was running for mayor of a town and his daughter would hinder his chances. A death notice was even put in the paper. Such sad, sad stories were littered throughout this book. I did initially find the writing quite cryptic but after a few chapters the book flowed. The research that went into writing this book was huge as historical facts are throughout. A time thankfully that has past and these 'prisons' shut down. I applaud the author for tackling such a sensitive topic and bringing out the truth of the suffering that occurred in these institutions."}], "description": "I was raised within the community of the New Zealand, Seacliff Mental Hospital village during the 1950s, with each of our family members working in the psychiatric hospital at some time or another. We sometimes shared our primary school with young patients who came down from the hospital. On turning fifteen we often worked up the hill, helping in the canteen, laundry, wards or occupational therapy. From a young age we absorbed the stories, and it was difficult to know where fiction ended and the greater truth took over.To separate the truths from the almost-truths at this stage would be an impossible task as many of those concerned have died. Therefore I have blended together various stories in this narrative as representative of our family and friends' combined belief of what most probably did happen during the period covered by this narrative. Wherever possible, I have used correct dates, names and places. When there is a modicum of doubt in my mind I have changed names and details for the protection of those still living.As a child I knew Malcolm, who was then a young man, since Dad often invited him home for meals. He was one of the lost children, those forgotten or abandoned by their families. We followed Malcolm's story from childhood to adulthood as best we could even after he was eventually discharged back into the community. When considering the tragedy and abuse of Malcolm's wasted earlier years, it is a story of immeasurable sadness. Yet he ultimately rose above it all, and with admirable strength, courage and innate resilience, was finally able to 'free the regular boy within' as he had always wanted.This is Malcolm's story as I believe it unfolded.", "title": "Phenomena: The Lost and Forgotten Children", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20739906-phenomena", "average": 4.16, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1417282824l/20739906.jpg", "reviews": 66, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7154859.Susan_Tarr", "name": "Susan Tarr"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1392074.Michael_Tarr", "name": "Michael Tarr"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7820347.Anna_Lund", "name": "Anna Lund"}], "type": ["Historical", "Health", "Psychology", "Fiction", "Inspirational"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20739906-phenomena", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22294333-phenomena", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39989342-miranda-bay", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23413882-jack-just-an-ordinary-dog-in-the-dog-house", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36562740-friends-to-the-end", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18141843-seacliff-a-regular-boy-within", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36454195-jack---just-an-ordinary-dog-in-the-dog-house", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
