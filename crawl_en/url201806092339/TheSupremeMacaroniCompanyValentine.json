I particularly enjoyed reading about Valentine Roncalli, a designer of custom made shoes and her big Italian family. \"The Supreme Macaroni Company\" is, I believe, the third book in a trilogy about Valentine and her family and her family's business. The author shines when she is describing the ups and downs that are common in Valentine's big Italian family. Coming from a big Italian family myself, her voice is authentic and very enjoyable as she begins this next (and supposedly last) chapter in Valentine's story.This book begins where \"Brava Valentine\" left off, with Valentine and Gianluca on the roof of her building, after he has just proposed. Without much time to revel in the joy of their engagement, they head to Brooklyn for a traditional family Christmas Eve and to share their good news. The family is in chaos when they arrive and though realistically portrayed, this gets a little wearing. Enough already with the mean old widowed Aunt Feen, who is nasty to everyone and gets away with it, and who prophesizes doom on Valentine and Gianluca (who she calls Giancarlo) because he has been married before. The novel quickly jumps from Christmas Eve to accomplishing a hurried wedding, then a quick honeymoon, a big fight between the newlyweds and it's back to New York for another crisis in the business. Valentine, at 36, is carrying on with the running of the Angelini Shoe Company and Gianluca, at 54, has a grown up daughter and runs a successful business in Italy but is willing to live in New York so she can continue to follow her dreams of creating fabulous shoes, not just custom, but for a broader market. The problem is that Valentine does not seem to realize that marriage changes things. The author demonstrates this very well when she writes\" I hoped to understand Gianluca's point of view. He wasn't fighting to keep me from working. He was fighting to show me how to live\".I think though, the author loses interest (mine) and focus (hers) when she starts throwing in multiple issues in rapid succession; it seemed to me as if she just wanted to get done with the book. At this point I'm wondering where the author ever got the title to the book. the reason finally appears on page 209 and it is as unsatisfying as it is unbelievable. The author was losing me at this point. From start to finish, this book encompasses two years of Valentine and Gianluca's lives and in no way does it finish Valentine's story. It is at once too much detail and not enough. People who have enjoyed the previous novels will want to read this but I doubt they will be satisfied."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3086082-michelle", "userReview": "The Supreme Macaroni Company is bad. Valentine is pathetic in this third novel. The much-anticipated wedding is rushed in an effort to get the stresses of their new marriage, but therein lies much of the problem. Most people know that marriage is tough, and there is an adjustment period for all newlyweds. Most people also realize that there are certain subjects that an engaged couple should discuss before finalizing their vows. Apparently, Valentine is not \u201cmost people\u201d because she fails to not only have these important discussions before the wedding, she does not even think about having these discussions. What results is what one would expect out of a couple that failed to sync up on such matters as where to live, children, expected roles in the marriage, etc. \u2013 lots and lots of arguing.This in and of itself is not a huge deal, but given how close Valentine is to the rest of her family, that she is the last one in her family to get married, that she has witnessed the ups and downs in each of her siblings\u2019 marriages, her lack of preparation is inexplicable. Her behavior does not fit with the careful Valentine fans have gotten to know over the course of the previous two books. While no one would be surprised that Valentine\u2019s marriage is a passionate one \u2013 quick to anger, quick to resolve \u2013 the arguments they have are just so unnecessary. It does not fit a man of Gianluca\u2019s nature either, especially since he is still harboring bitter feelings about the ending of his first marriage.The story compounds matters by following the same pattern \u2013 Valentine and Gianluca are happy, something about the business comes up, one or the other gets upset, Valentine overreacts and thinks the marriage is doomed, cooler heads prevail, they reaffirm their love for each other, and the cycle begins again. This happens for all but the last thirty pages of the novel. After so many repetitions, it becomes old and, quite frankly, boring.The only way out of this never-ending cycle is to create an event that shocks everyone out of their ennui, and Ms. Trigiani does just that. However, it is at that precise moment where readers will lose complete respect for the novel. For the ending is purely there for shock value. As with Valentine\u2019s weird issues about marriage that make no sense given her background, the ending does not fit with the story. One expects certain things in romance novels, and Ms. Trigiani fails to deliver. The abrupt plot shift is simply a disservice to the fans and to Valentine.Adriana Trigiani can write a good story. Anyone who doubts that needs to immediately read The Shoemaker\u2019s Wife. However, The Supreme Macaroni Company is not her best effort. It is not even close to her best effort. It is dull, repetitive, and whiny. Valentine acts in a manner that is not realistic given her close family ties and involvement. The plot circles in on itself many times before the use of a shocking twist resolves the lingering plot issues. The end feels cheap and does not fit with its intended romance genre. The Supreme Macaroni Company has its moments, but the majority of the novel is a trivial, supremely frustrating glimpse into one person\u2019s idealized and completely unrealistic thoughts on marriage."}, {"userName": "Gloria Bernal", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1066448-gloria-bernal", "userReview": "I am a die-hard-Trigiani-fan. It is very difficult for me to give this author anything less than a 4 star rating, but feel compelled to in this case. The \u201csubstance\u201d of the plot-line just wasn\u2019t enough to make this a compelling un-put-downable novel for me, as hers usually are. Yes, there is still the wit, and some real gems in here. The Italian-family-bantering, ever present, especially true to form when the planning of the wedding between the two main characters takes place. Think \u201cBig Fat Greek Wedding\u201d and you won\u2019t be far off, except for the ethnicity. Gianluca has just proposed to Valentine in the last novel. This sequel takes us through their wedding and the two years after. Gianluca\u2019s home is Italy, where he has an ex, a grown & pregnant daughter, and a father who recently married Valentine\u2019s grandmother. Val is a shoe designer with a family business to run in New York. She is mid 30\u2019s career woman, never married. Basically this novel is about two people who love each other but have to adjust to the team-concept of marriage, and we, as readers, are privy to the ups & downs of it all. That\u2019s pretty much it. Not unusual, not compelling, but interesting. Nothing to knock your socks off. There are tender moments, funny moments, and profound statements made about love, life and grief, and Trigiani efficiently delivers those with a tug or two at our hearts. The title, however, does this a disservice, in my humble opinion. The reason for it may be a spoiler, so I won\u2019t go into why it was used, but the only thing linking the pasta and the shoes together is that Italians make both. I didn\u2019t feel the reasoning behind it warranted naming the novel after the Macaroni Co. I liked this, but it didn\u2019t have me anxiously awaiting a free moment to pick it up and continue with the read. I would definitely recommend The Shoemaker\u2019s Wife, however. Now that, dear reader, has some meat in with the pasta ;)"}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3444485-maria", "userReview": "I love Adriana Trigiani. I do. I have read every one of her books. This one just left me flat. I am so sorry but it did. I was left with the feeling that the author just wanted to finish off this trilogy. There was so MUCH to work with and so little was really addressed and what was addressed was not addressed well in my opinion. Now before I get booed let me say this. The Shoemaker's Wife is one of my al time favorite books and that is what I was basing this series on. Since it was in 3 books I expected a lot of that meaty, lovely detail and I got that...in the first 2 books. This one, va bene... and just that. Sorry Adriana!"}, {"userName": "Audrey Dailey", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3945637-audrey-dailey", "userReview": "I did not like this book as much as I wanted to. I really like Adriana Trigiani and I was looking forward to reading it quite a bit...maybe the anticipation set my sights too high. The story line was pretty good but I felt like I couldn't get a bead on the characters, which may be due to the fact that this is the third book about them and I read the other two a while ago. I felt like it just showed snapshots in the life of this woman and I couldn't figure out what she wanted. It just seemed kind of disjointed to me. That being said, I do hope Trigiani writes another book about Valentine because it does not feel like her story is done."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Garcia", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4771509-jennifer-garcia", "userReview": "This story is just another reason as to why Adriana Trigiani is one of my most favorite authors. In this book, the end of the trilogy, she touched me with all the feels one could imagine. Tissue warning. The book brought me, once again, to the table of the crazy Italian American family. A table that I know so well and remember with such fondness. The crazy aunt, the loud voices always talking over each other, and the bickering. The connections, the names, and the meaning behind it all just kept putting that lump back in my throat. It was all for a purpose and one so full of unconditional love that it touched me so deep inside. I honestly cannot say that I saw Valentine's life going in the direction it did, and I must say I am extremely heartbroken over it. However, the lessons, although too late, were good ones. Perhaps the lessons were not too late and they happened as a result of things that were fated, however, devastating they may have been. I haven't cried this much since The Shoemaker's Wife over a book and I've read many in between, including all of Adriana's. The imagery and descriptions in a Trigiani novel are always spectacular and this one was perfect. The dialogue was spot on and very well done and it gave us such a sense of the dynamic of all the people involved in the story. I cannot say that I'm happy with this ending, but I understand it and all its lessons and hopes for her future. It makes me wish that Valentine will go forward with purpose and live what she learned. Now with my broken heart and sore eyes, I will sit and wait for another Adriana Trigiani masterpiece."}, {"userName": "Ladyslott", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3475302-ladyslott", "userReview": "Adriana Trigiani is one of my favorite authors for easy to read so called \u2018women\u2019s fiction\u2019. I find them a nice break when I want something generally quick, easy and enjoyable. I have read most of her books and have really liked every one of them. Until today.This is supposed to be the final book in the \u201cValentine\u201d trilogy, where we have been following the life of Valentine Roncalli, a custom shoemaker with a very large Italian family, living in New York and trying to find love while building her business. This book starts exactly where book two ends. I don\u2019t want to spoil anything for those who haven\u2019t read the series, but that will be hard to do, so if you plan on reading these books maybe turn away. I won\u2019t reveal major spoilers for this book, but may spoil the previous two.I don\u2019t even know where to start. Trigiani has taken a character I really liked and turned her into someone else. Instead of the relatively ambitious, tried and true New Yorker we have a bit of a shrew. She whines, second-guesses everything, picks stupid arguments, and doubts the man she is supposed to love; makes idiotic rash decisions and ultimately turns into someone I didn\u2019t want to spend anytime with.Aside from the character development there were problems all around. The family, as usual, is extremely over the top. And things happen so quickly it\u2019s like a fairy tale. A major wedding is planned and executed in 2 months (in a catering hall I know very well, and trust me that would never happen). A decision to expand the business is undertaken and executed in less than a year. And despite spending all her life avoiding members of her family suddenly everyone is working in the business. The humor, which felt real in the first books, felt forced here. And then with all this tumult tragedy rears it\u2019s ugly head, but it\u2019s not a heart wrenching surprise, it is foreshadowed over and over again.I honestly feel that the author was done with the storyline and just wanted to wrap it up ASAP. And honestly the title is just so wrong. I believe the original title was Ciao Valentine, which was perfect. But you have to read almost half the book to understand the title, and ultimately it\u2019s just ridiculous.It makes me sad to say skip this book, but if you want to remember Valentine as she was in Very Valentine and Brava Valentine \u2013 skip it.Garners three stars only because of how much I enjoyed the first two books."}, {"userName": "Holly", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1744565-holly", "userReview": "I've been a fan of Trigiani's books in the past but I don't know if I'm now \"growing out of them\" or her writing has simply stopped progressing such that there's nothing much new to read in her work. I feel like it's just another family saga where not too much happens other than some fun dynamics at family dinners, etc. I'll admit that some of the repartee between characters is amusing and that the wit and humor she imbues along the way is delightful. That said, the story line is maudlin and the prose edges slightly to what I fear a romantic novel might provide. If she wants to remain contemporary in her books, I'm hoping that Trigiani will step up her game next time. While this wasn't a failure, it's hard to recommend this one."}, {"userName": "Joyce", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10238440-joyce", "userReview": "I like most of Trigiani's books whether its the Big Gap series, the Valentine series or her memoir about her grandmothers.This book was just sort of anti-climactic and could almost have been a story in a magazine, rather than a novel in this series.Frankly, it left me wanting more of a story. But, perhaps its just a prelude to the next Valentine novel?A bit of a let down. The writing is good, just too much focus on the crazy Italian family get togethers and their bantering back and forth.I am still a devoted Tigiani fan just the same."}, {"userName": "Abbie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/723067-abbie", "userReview": "It pains me to give only two stars to a novel by Adriana Trigiani. But alas, it must be done. I received an Advance Reader's Edition of the book. I've read ARE's before but never has there been so many grammar, punctuation and other typographical mistakes. There were words missing, quotes that were followed by some sort of shorthand to say, \"this will be translated to Italian\". Since this is an Advance Reader's Edition, I SWEAR I'm not judging the book based on a misplaced comma. This book just felt like it had no point except to wrap up the Valentine series. If I didn't know better, it felt to me like there was no passion behind this book. Like the author knew how she wanted to end the series but just had to plod her way there in 300 pages or more. Imagine baking a ton of cookies. Batches and batches. You know there's an end in sight, you just have to get there. The last batch or two are really just in your way before you can move onto your next - more exciting - project. At one point you are slinging mounds of dough onto the cookie sheet, in no pattern whatsoever and not utilizing your previously perfected cookie cutter. Once baked, the cookies are still sweet and tasty, but they are not very attractive and sort of resemble piles of mush. That description IS this book. I am actually looking forward to Adriana Trigiani's next book.

Her and Gianluca never made sense to me. Too much hiding things from each other. It just seemed very un-Valentine from all the previous novels. As well, the whole story just felt very rushed.

I have terrible book recall so I had to spend some of my valuable reading time to get reacquainted with the series before starting on The Supreme Macaroni Co. Those feelings vanished as soon as I re entered Valentines world. What a nice place to make a return visit to. The Supreme Macaroni Co. picks up at the exact point that Brava Valentine ends, on the roof of Valentine\u2019s Greenwich Village apartment following Gianluca's proposal. It continues the story of Valentine's struggles to bring her family's couture shoe company into financial success in the 21st century as well as all the activities surrounding planning her wedding to Gianlucca and first year-ish as a married couple. If you have read the other Valentine books this is an absolute must read. The phrase, \"warm and witty\" could have been invented to describe the first two books in the Valentine series. However, The Supreme Macaroni Co takes a more serious tone. It is still incredibly warm, most of the characters are well intentioned and loving. The family's loyalty to each other is nice and at times pretty hilarious but there are some darker topics covered here which made me cry lots of ugly tears. I don't want to give any spoilers but I can't imagine Valentine fans will be able to read this without a tear or two escaping. This book didn't feel like a final book in a trilogy.

Set in 2010, The Supreme Macaroni Company follows the life of Valentine Roncalli, an Italian American who is running her family's famous company, the Angelini Shoe Company. Valentine has agreed to marry the Italian Gianluca Vechiarelli, a tanner who produces the leather for her shoe company. Yet Valentine is determined to have her way in their marriage, and to accomplish everything on her own terms. She soon learns the difficulty of juggling a business, a large extended family, an independent husband, and motherhood is more than she can manage smoothly on her own. This novel is the third in a series, preceded by the best-selling Very Valentine and Brava, Valentine. I have read neither of the first two books, and while that certainly did not hinder my understanding of this novel at all, I suspect that a carry over affection for the characters and stories may be the only reason this book does well. I found this novel rushed and the relationships and emotions felt forced. It felt like I was reading a poorly acted out soap opera. Additionally, her large family makes it feel as if you're reading an Italian version of My Big Fat Greek Wedding between the controlling mother, petulant, negative aunt, and father who is supposed to have the amusing habit of mixing up vocabulary words. \"Charlie was ejaculating -' 'Oh, Dad, you must mean gesticulating - talking with his hands?' My dad's malaprops gets worse when he's nervous\" (18). I didn't find it particularly amusing. The relationships felt very stilted - possibly a result of too much telling versus showing. A lot of the big family drama seemed cliche and flat, \"There's the famous Legoland, known for its plastics, and during the holidays, we Roncallis build our own version, Tupperware Land. [...] We disburse the leftovers in various plastic containers, which are handed out as guests leave, three to five pounds heavier than when they arrived, depart\" (48). Just not very clever.This novel had really interesting elements - I loved the idea of learning more of the behind the scenes of a shoe company and having a focus on an Italian-American family. However, the delivery did not impress me. In addition to being disappointed with the stilted relationships between the characters, the plot seemed weak. Not much really happens in this and most of the plot tension comes from disagreements between Valentine and her new husband. Although, to its credit, the first two novels may be much better, and may explain the lingering affection for Valentine and her family as characters."}, {"userName": "Agaughan68", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3163766-agaughan68", "userReview": "First, I have to say I loved Adriana Trigiani's earlier books.

I also didn't like their little girl's name. Ugh! Did she think she was going to have many children so she could waste naming one of her children? I was rolling my eyes when they were setting up the shoe company in Youngstown, Ohio. The storyline was getting so cloying.

I had read The Shoemaker\u2019s Wife which I loved, but the not the other novels about this family and Valentine. I found Valentine to be selfish, ambitious, driven and prone to not thinking things through carefully, if at all. She is woman who goes after what she wants and usually gets it. Her choices and reactions at times struck me as bizarre. And yet, even though at times I felt like clipping her around the ear and telling her to wake up to herself and that marriage is about compromise, I still wanted to keep reading. I certainly didn\u2019t agree with her view about their only being one fight in marriage that is never solved. (See Page 176 in the hard cover version.) Despite negatives this story still drew me in. That could be largely to do with the cast of characters. They are a close family who share each other\u2019s joys and problems, too much so at time. While I enjoyed the interactions between the family and the glimpses of family life it made me glad I came from a small family that wasn\u2019t constantly in each other\u2019s lives like this, especially with a character like Aunt Feen. She is the sort of cranky, hard to please character that can bring a smile when they come to life in fiction but you wouldn\u2019t want to met her in real life, or even worse have her as a relative. Some of the dialogue is clever and witty and I whenever I had to put the book down, I wanted to get back to it to see what they were all up to. I liked the way Valentine father managed to muddle up his English words at times and loved all the attention to detail about making shoes.

She's given her readers the romantic ending they were waiting for at the end of the previous book and then destroyed her heroine's happiness with a terrible tragedy in the next book. I get that this is what life throws at us, and the depiction of grief is sensitively handled, but the ending is not what I wanted from this series. Sometimes when a writer confounds our expectations and subverts genres, it works brilliantly, and there have been several genre novels with unexpected tragic endings which I have loved. In this case though I just wanted a happy ending to a series I was enjoying as lightweight chick-lit romance, and it didn't deliver. The comic relief provided by family and friends is as entertaining and over the top as ever, and I did enjoy these aspects, but I found other aspects of the narrative as problematic as the ending. The first books balanced the romantic and business stories beautifully, and both engaged me completely as a reader. In this book, though, I felt that both stories lacked dramatic momentum and Valentine's obsession with her shoe business seems selfish and self-destructive rather than endearing, as it was before.

SUPREME MACARONI COMPANY is a rewarding continuation in the story of Valentine Roncalli.

I don't think I have ever given her books less than four stars before. My finger hovered between 3, then 4, and back again. I finally just had to do it. This was just a three star rating for me.The Supreme Macaroni Company is the third book in the Valentine trilogy. Valentine comes from a family rich in history and in love; love for family, love for hard work in making a success of the family shoe business, and love for their Italian roots. Valentine knew her family history by heart and her heart was into designing and making shoes and keeping the family tradition going. She is headstrong, determined, and passionate when it comes to her family business and at the age of 35, she has had to answer only to herself and to follow only her heart.Now, Valentine is engaged to Gianluca Vechiarelli who happens to be the son of her grandmother's second husband. He is 53, divorced, and the father of a young married daughter. He is also devoted to the shoe business and it was that interest in shoes that brought the two together in Italy in the first place. After a whirlwind engagement and marriage (within the span of less than two months), the couple has married and are living in the states. Gianluca would like for his new wife to slow down, place some distance between herself and her burning drive to open a new shoe factory. He would love to move to Italy once more where life would be slower, more sensual and more relaxing. Valentine can't tear herself away; thus the new shoe factory The Supreme Macaroni Company. Her drive, her hard work, her family, and Gianluca's support helped to make her dream come true, but the victory doesn't come without pain and consequences.This was a shorter, faster-paced novel than the previous ones I have read. While the hysterical antics of her large, emotionally charged Italian family are still there, I missed the slow, rich history that Trigiani weaves into her beautiful stories. I missed the tender ache that I have felt when reading about this wonderful family and of the sacrifices that they made throughout the years as the held on to their families and as they built an American dream.I found Valentine, at the age of 35, to be extremely immature--or maybe selfish is a better word. She had no idea of sacrifice and compromise in the name of love. She was blinded by her own determination to expand her business and she forgot that her husband was her partner in business and in life and that he, too, had dreams for the future. It seemed that this Valentine had learned nothing from her family's history about love and the pleasure that comes with spending time together. This Valentine wasn't the Valentine I admired and cheered in the first two books.As I was reading, I felt an undercurrent throughout the book. It was as if Trigiani was preparing me for a disappointment. I finally flipped back to the end of the book to see what was going to happen and I hate it when I do that, but I needed to be reassured that all was going to be well in the end. Trigiani was right. I was disappointed. But I was prepared."}, {"userName": "Cameran", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16033752-cameran", "userReview": "There is just something about Adriana Trigiani books -- and the Valentine series in particular -- that warms my heart and leaves me with life lessons to think about. In the final installment of this trilogy Valentine is on the verge of having it all. The custom wedding shoes business that she has inherited from her grandmother is stable; the mass retail shoe line she has begun is on the cusp of fruition; and the love of her life has asked her to marry him. Once you mix in the endearing (and hilarious!) cast of supporting characters comprised of Valentine\u2019s large Italian family, the fun is never ending. But what I took to be the most wonderful aspect of this book is the commentary on marriage, especially a new marriage like our heroine\u2019s.Valentine is ambitious; she has plenty of dreams about her business and is under the delusion that a marriage would lead to nothing changing in the way she leads her day to day life. She believes that an independent woman should not have to sacrifice anything to her husband, and this leads to plenty of arguments and revelations along the way. The plot twist that occurs towards the end of the book was very unexpected, yet applicable to all that Valentine\u2019s husband had been trying to teach her since they had met. She learns that it is wonderful to have dreams, but that they must also be coupled with the people who will bring you the greatest amount of joy. Compromise, sacrifice, and communication are necessary no matter what anyone does. Lessons such as these can be found throughout the trilogy; they make up the heart of the story and evolve to be at where Valentine is in her life.My only issue with this book was how quickly it could move. It is the final story of the series, and it makes a point to include everything the author wanted to tell about Valentine\u2019s life over the time span of two years. Because of this I often wanted things to slow down so that I might appreciate things more. For that reason, The Supreme Macaroni Company is not my favorite book of the trilogy, but this continues to be a series that I would recommend to plenty of people. The lessons that can be learned are relatable to my friends and I. The author is a master at creating setting and well-formed characters. I\u2019ll miss Valentine, but I\u2019ll always look forward to more work from Trigiani in the future."}, {"userName": "Book Preview Review", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18186343-book-preview-review", "userReview": "Book Description:\u201cIn The Shoemaker's Wife Adriana Trigiani swept her readers across generations of an Italian family, from the Italian Alps at the turn of the twentieth century to the cobblestone streets of Little Italy.

I had the privilege of attending 2 book signings with Adriana Trigiani in the last year and a half, the first one was for the paperback edition of The Shoemaker's Wife, and most recently a brunch to promote this novel. Adriana Trigiani is a personable, warm, funny, down to earth individual who exudes charm and emotion. She takes the time to personally talk with her readers as she signs their books, and always writes something special in each one. She professed to recognize me from the first time I had seen her, and she demonstrated that in her signing. When I told her my sister in law had the flu and was so disappointed at missing the brunch, she wrote feel better in her book. A wonderful author with a big personality.The novel does not disappoint although some of the reviews that I read do not agree with mine. It had been awhile since I read the last two books, but this novel starts exactly where the second one had left off. Valentine has just accepted Giancula's proposal prior to attending her family's Christmas festivities. Immediately the reader is drawn into the lives of Valentine and her friends and family. After having listened to Adriana's family stories at the brunch, I could actually hear her voice coming through every word on the page. The novel is about the struggles of marriage and work, compromise, and relationships, but most importantly the novel is about family loyalty, and the importance of loved ones helping each other navigate the challenges and triumphs of life. I am Jewish and this book is about Italians, but more than anything, this book is about human beings, family and friends, and relationships which transcend all else including wealth or work. I don't want to give out any spoilers, but if you are a fan of Adriana Trigiani and the Valentine series, give this book a try."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3345952-jessica", "userReview": "The Supreme Macaroni Company called to me, both because it was by Adriana Trigiani and because of the Italian heritage I knew would run deep in it. I'm always fascinated by glimpses into the lives of others. I also love Trigiani's ability to bring a whole family, an entire clan of loving, swearing, supportive people, to life. I was ready to get lost in another of her books.Keep in mind I had no idea this was the third book in a series. Apparently Valentine's story has been going on for two books previous to this, and therefore I was coming in at the end. On the bright side, it didn't even register that I'd missed anything at first. Valentine and Gianluca were easy to fall in step with. I was a little daunted by their age difference initially, but their family dynamic really drew me in.What kept me from falling in love with The Supreme Macaroni Company was that everything moved so quickly. Time flew as Valentine moved from being engaged, to being a married woman and beyond. I adored how much passion she had for her work. I wanted to see more of her creations. More of her personality. It all felt swallowed up by her relationship with Gianluca. Maybe if I had read the first two books I'd feel differently. Perhaps what I was missing happened in books past. All I know is that I ended the book feeling a bit cheated.It's true that it's harder to judge The Supreme Macaroni Company, simply because I didn't know this was the last book in a series. Still, I can't deny that I enjoyed the ride. The relationship between Valentine and Gianluca was bittersweet, and I did love the family as well. If nothing else I know I'll be going to back to read the two books before this."}], "description": "For over a hundred years, the Angelini Shoe Company in Greenwich Village has relied on the leather produced by Vechiarelli & Son in Tuscany.
